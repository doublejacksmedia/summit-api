[00:00:09.240] - Liz Stapleton, Summit Host
I'm super excited for a session with Amira from A Self Guru. She's a fellow attorney, and so I'll try not to nerd out too much on this session. But, Amira, thank you so much for joining us. And why don't you give people a little bit about your background?

[00:00:23.880] - Amira Irfan, aselfguru.com
Absolutely.

[00:00:24.540] - Amira
Well, it's a pleasure to be here. Liz, thank you so much for the opportunity. And for those of you watching. My name is Amira. I'm a business lawyer, blogger at aselfguru.com. I work full time as a lawyer. And I also have my blog as my side hustle. And so far I've been helping entrepreneurs. I've helped over thousands of entrepreneurs with their legal business, with the legal side of their business, whether through my legal templates or through my one on one services.

[00:00:51.600] - Liz
Yeah. And before we dive in, we do need to say because we are lawyers, that this is not legal advice. We don't know the specifics of your situation. We're probably not licensed where you live, you know, because it is state by state. And so this is really just informational educational purposes to help you kind of figure out what your next step should be. Did I cover it? Is there anything you want to add to our disclaimer?

[00:01:13.810] - Amira
No. I love it. You did my work. I was just about....

[00:01:16.720] - Liz
Well, same for me. Right, because I'm an attorney. I don't want to, so let's go ahead, because a lot of people, when they start blogging, don't realize that there is this whole legal side to it. They're like, they get posting and all that stuff. So what is sort of the first or the most common mistake you see bloggers making when it comes to the legal side of things?

[00:01:37.310] - Amira
Yeah, you're absolutely right.

[00:01:38.610] - Amira
You know, when I started my blog, I notice so many things myself. I mean, blogging is just has so many components to it. But one of the first mistakes that I see bloggers making all the time is they don't have a proper privacy policy on their website. And then we can talk about it like why that's a mistake, because first thing is the privacy policy is legally required. So it's a really important document that every blogger and not just blogger, but any online entrepreneur

[00:02:06.030] - Liz
On any website needs because and it's not like there's it's kind of it's required from like a lot of different parts of a lot of laws.

[00:02:15.540] - Liz
So it's not like there's this one that says websites need privacy policies. There's not. But there's so many laws. And basically it comes down to you need one. It's. For federal, state, local, international, it's just accept that fact.

[00:02:30.450] - Amira
I know, like at this point, I'm sure people are aware of GDPR people that have heard about the California Consumer Privacy Act, just so many different laws. And like you said, Liz, is just one of those things that, you know, you just need it on your website.

[00:02:44.830] - Liz
Yeah. And let's try to explain a little bit what that is and kind of the purpose of it, because people like, well, I'm not collecting information. It's like, well, do you have a contact form? Do you allow comments on your site, are you doing email marketing where you're growing a list? And we have a whole session to talk about GDPR and email list growing and stuff. But, you know, you're probably collecting information without realizing it.

[00:03:05.710] - Liz
So why don't you kind of explain a little bit what a privacy policy is? And I mean, I think in blogging terms, if you do need one, I mean, you just need one period.

[00:03:14.450] - Amira
 Exactly. So a privacy policy is a legal document. It basically informs your website visitors that what information you're collecting from them and why are you collecting it. Because think about it. I come on to your website. I give you my name, my email address. Like if you have an opt in form and I subscribe to your newsletter, then I have now just supplied personal information to you. So as a visitor or as a subscriber, I have a legal right to know what are you going to do with that information?

[00:03:43.330] - Amira
Like how are you going to use it? In what circumstances you will disclose it or you won't. So that's why a proper privacy policy kind of outlines all of that good stuff in there, including your email marketing, compliance and different laws, as we talked about. So that's really in a nutshell, the purpose of a privacy policy is to kind of let your visitors, website visitors know what you're going to do with that information. And like you mentioned, Liz, it's not just your name or your email address.

[00:04:12.760] - Amira
It could be even the credit card information that people are supplying to make a purchase from your website. It could be even Google Analytics, right, because you're getting a lot of data from people when you have Google Analytics on your site, it could be even ads that you're running on your website. So there's so many different ways that you are collecting information.

[00:04:34.150] - Liz
Yeah, I mean, just even if you're not running a bunch of ads, like as we've mentioned, there's tons of ways that you are collecting information.

[00:04:41.710] - Liz
Privacy policy is really just informing your visitors, your readers, of what you're doing, it's being open and honest, because I'm pretty sure we've all gotten those emails from those big companies that had data breaches or whatever. And this is why we see it more and more sometimes. They didn't admit to that until years later, which was really just a jerk move. So it's just you being kind to the people visiting your site is how I like to think of it.

[00:05:04.780] - Amira
Yeah, I couldn't agree more.

[00:05:07.540] - Liz
OK, so. There is, looking at my notes, so there's a lot of different ways you can get a privacy policy for your site. I know Wordpress going that has a default one, but it's a default one for a reason. I think you and I would both say that they should get one from a lawyer. You know, a template from a lawyer is going to be way better than anything free out there.

[00:05:35.600] - Liz
You know, something personalized that you work with a lawyer, one on one is going to be ideal, but not everyone can afford that. And I know you sell templates. Is there anything you know, I don't want to just like like, oh, buy your templates, I mean, yes, they're awesome. Clearly, you've helped thousands. But anything you want to add to that, sort of like you should get it from a lawyer, period.

[00:05:55.360] - Liz
And if you can afford. Well, I always am. Like if you can afford to work with a lawyer, do it. Do you have any suggestions are added?

[00:06:02.320] - Amira
Yeah. And this is a great question. And I get this question a lot. So a lot of times bloggers and I understand that when we're starting our online business, whether it's blogging or any other kind of business cost are high right? So we want to save money and cut corners where we can, but legal stuff guys is not something where you should cut corners on. And I'm not just saying that because Liz and I are lawyers. I'm saying that because over the years as a lawyer, I have audited legal documents all my life.

[00:06:29.630] - Amira
So I've I've also audited the free privacy policies that are floating on the Web. And the big issue with those is that there are always missing key legal provisions kind of exposing you to legal harm and legal liability, defeating the purpose of having this template in the first place. Because if you have a template on your site or a document on your site that doesn't even protect you, then what is the point of it? Right. So that's the first concern with the free legal template that you just grab from Google that it's going to be deficient.

[00:07:01.180] - Amira
I've personally audited them and I found a lot of loopholes in them. The other issue, and it's interesting because I recently actually interviewed one of my customers and her name is Elizabeth, and she's a lawyer, too. So she's actually my customer and she purchased my bundle. And this is exactly the question that I asked her. And I said, Elizabeth, why did you, you're a lawyer, you could have written it or you could have grabbed a free template. Why did you go for my bundle? And she said, you know, she brought up a really good point. And I knew this as a lawyer, but I wanted people to hear from her as my customer. Is that there are copyright violations. You don't know who wrote the free template. You don't even know if you have the legal rights to use it. You just assume that you do. You go on the website and you go on Google and you just grab something.

[00:07:44.860] - Amira
But think about it, do know who created it. You have the legal rights to use it. You don't. You don't get, like, lifetime updates. Like if you were to purchase from me or any other lawyer, you would get some support, some updates. You don't get any of that with the free legal templates out there. So

[00:08:03.670] - Liz
And I also just want to add like a lawyer bought it, because not all lawyers specialize in this.

[00:07:44.860] - Liz
It's why we're not like, oh, that's why I'm like, don't talk, like I'm not trademarks copyright person. Like, I can answer very basic, but really you need to go talk to this person or, you know, there are areas of specialization within the law. And so not every lawyer, you know, like you could talk to your family friend who's a lawyer, and they're going to have a clue as to what you're talking about with your blog and the legal side of things.

[00:08:28.630] - Amira
Exactly. Like exactly like Elizabeth example I gave as a lawyer. Her specialty is not business law. Right? She's not writing contracts everyday like I am. So, yes, you're absolutely right. So you do want to make sure that you get the template from a lawyer that actually specializes in this, that is actually experienced in that realm. And and, you know, you always have the option of hiring a lawyer, too.

[00:08:50.800] - Amira
So this way you get a custom drafted policy

[00:08:53.530] - Liz
That's really going to meet all of your needs because they're going to know state locally what you're actually doing. It'll you know, I always am like once you can't afford that, go do that. Like use the template. Yes. It's going to be a lot better than anything. But once you can afford to, like, hire an attorney to review it, to check it, to add if you're doing something else, do that.

[00:09:13.570] - Amira
Yeah, absolutely. Exactly. So I mean, that just give you that added peace of mind, you know what I mean?

[00:09:20.320] - Liz
And then the other thing... Not that... There's lots of other things, but the next you kind of want to touch on is a lot of bloggers aren't aware of the necessary disclosures and disclaimers. They know about affiliate disclosures but then that's it. So can you dive into sort of the mistakes people make there and sort of what the difference is, why they need them, all that exciting stuff?

[00:09:43.750] - Amira
Yeah, exactly. So another mistake I see is that people always confuse the two terms like disclosures and disclaimers, and they're using them interchangeably.

[00:09:53.140] - Amira
But it's kind of like two separate things. A blog disclosure is when you were like disclosed, just like the names,

[00:09:59.590] - Liz
You're telling them something.

[00:10:00.550] - Amira
Yeah, you're telling them something. You're giving them, you're putting them on notice for something. And then a disclaimer, on the other hand, again, just the way it sounds is when you're disclaiming, you're denying legal liability for something. So in a very simple way to explain, that's really essentially the difference.

[00:10:17.170] - Amira
But they also serve two different purposes. So a disclosure is kind of like legally required under the Federal Trade Commission for affiliate links, sponsorships, things like that. So if you're, if someone is, for example, let's talk about affiliate links first, because a lot of bloggers share affiliate links on their website, they promote products that they're an affiliate for, and then they're going to earn a commission. So now you're legally required by the Federal Trade Commission to give a blog disclosure.

[00:10:46.250] - Amira
And it's basically telling people that, hey, this link is an affiliate link. I may earn a commission if you purchase through my link at no extra cost to you or something like that.

[00:10:55.850] - Liz
And I do want to say, like you explained, what affiliate link means. You can't just be like this is an affiliate link.

[00:11:00.620] - Amira
Yes.

[00:11:00.750] - Liz
Because a lot of people like, as bloggers, we know what that means. But ask your mom if they do, like people that, if you're not specifically blogging about blogging, then a lot of people may not understand that.

[00:11:12.700] - Liz
So you need to either not use that language or you need to explain it, which will mean your disclosure is a little longer. So I just I always like to point that out.

[00:11:20.780] - Amira
Yeah, exactly. And that's another mistake. A lot of the websites that I've audited, they'll just say this, this blog post contains affiliate links and just stop right there. There's no link to the actual blog disclosure or the disclaimer page.

[00:11:34.370] - Amira
And so, yes, that's not sufficient. Legally, you're supposed to go a little extra and at least give them any disclosure, saying that this blog post may contain affiliate links. Please see the full disclosure here and then also write that I may earn a commission. This way it's clear to the reader, what is it that, that you're disclosing? And then the disclaimer, on the other hand, as I mentioned, is your way of limiting liability. So avoiding lawsuits for the content that you publish on your website.

[00:12:02.810] - Amira
So just like how we give our legal disclaimer in the beginning. So that's an example of a disclaimer. But it also is important to know that disclaimer needs to be tailored to the kind of content that you're publishing on your blog. If you're in the health and fitness niche, then you're going to obviously have a health medical disclaimer. You know, if you're in the personal finance and you have a finance disclaimer, it's going to vary depending on the kind of stuff that you're publishing.

[00:12:28.580] - Amira
And essentially the main purpose of a disclaimer is to just let people know that, hey, this is just information I don't want you to rely on this information as advice and come after me later on with a lawsuit. So there are different kinds of disclaimers, again, depending on what is it

[00:12:44.480] - Liz
And it could be something like, that what side of the line you fall on, like in the personal finance space. So I initially started on personal finance. I still have it a little bit by the wayside. I need to get back to it, but I'm not a financial adviser and so I need to say so. And people who are financial advisors, it's going to be similar to like a professional disclaimer, like lawyers like, hey, I am a financial advisor, but this isn't an advice. Whereas mine's like, hey, I'm not a financial advisor, just my own personal experience. You know, it's not official advice. So it's a little bit of a different angle.

[00:13:12.830] - Liz
But it's the same idea because and I we've talked about it, but we haven't really made it clear. Yes, there are laws in place that require you to have certain things, but you're not necessarily going to like go to jail. You know, you may face fines if the FTC it's really going to end up having to sacrifice the money you earned. But really, the biggest thing you're trying to protect yourself from are lawsuits,

[00:13:35.210] - Amira
Correct.

[00:13:36.080] - Liz
Or protect yourself from what you know, so I just wanted to explain from what.

[00:13:12.830] - Liz
But lawsuits is is probably the primary thing that you see a lot of and there's a lot of steps before you get sued. But just keeping in mind that that's really what you're protecting your personal assets, you're protecting your business by making sure you have these things. And that's why it's important, because you don't want to get sued.

[00:13:58.760] - Amira
Exactly, and also you know, another thing I would add Liz, is that you're also putting that professional look out there, right? Like having these legal pages and having, doing things legally it also shows your potential customers, to your readers and just anyone that you come in contact with in business that you mean business. You are professional now. Right. So especially if you started your blog with the intention of making money, turning into a career or a business, then you ought to, then it just goes, it's a no brainer to then just go ahead and make sure that you secure it legally as well.

[00:14:31.670] - Liz
Yeah. And I do just want to mention some other types of disclaimers and disclosures that people might need, we're not going to dive into all of them because we don't have time. But like earnings disclaimers, testimonial, like there's so many different things you need to disclaim or disclose depending on what they are and don't want to use them them interchangeably. But, you know, they are things that people don't realize, they are like, "oh, testimonials." No, you need to explain that not everyone is going to have to see those results.

[00:15:02.030] - Liz
So just there's a lot more than just FTC affiliate sponsored stuff. And you don't necessarily have to be compensated with cash. It could be a free product, too, is another thing people don't realize. And a lot of different things you may need disclaim as well, depending on what you're doing. So I just do want to mention that. And any template from a good lawyer, I know you as well. You in particular, you know, is going to include things like that because it's in the nature of this business.

[00:15:30.350] - Amira
Exactly, exactly. Any if, especially if you're going to purchase from our lawyer, you know, it's going to be comprehensive. It's going to cover all of that stuff. Plus more like the limitations of legal liability language, which a normal person can't just write on their own if they're not well versed in the law.

[00:15:44.650] - Liz
Yeah, I just kind of want to mention those things I guarantee anyone that has sales page or something. OK, so. What are you, why shouldn't people be writing their own disclaimers, I guess is a good question to ask?

[00:16:04.730] - Amira
Yeah, I mean, we touched on that a little bit, but because, as you mentioned, Liz, it's not just a simple one liner disclosure, or disclaimer you need like an actual proper policy. Right. That really describes a well written disclaimer page is going to include your affiliated disclosures, affiliate disclaimers.

[00:16:21.860] - Amira
It's going to include your earnings disclaimer, your testimonial disclaimer. So there's so much more to it than just the simplistic way that we try to explain it to you. So because of the fact that it's it's an actual legal policy, a page on your site, you just want to make sure that it's comprehensive enough to kind of cover all your legal bases. So you could certainly try writing one or two sentences here. But if you want to get the protection and feel better at the end of the day, that, OK, I've really covered myself and every possible way I can, then, of course, a template from a lawyer is going to give you that satisfaction.

[00:16:59.480] - Liz
Yeah. And I do just want to mention, because you talk about a disclosures disclaimers page and then we have a privacy policy page. So because I don't think this is talked about enough, that it's having them on separate pages as opposed to one legal page. So do you want to kind of dig into that a little bit?

[00:17:15.770] - Amira
Yeah, a lot of times people will just lump all their legal pages into this one legal page and sometimes they'll call it legal and then you'll just go to that page and you can't even distinguish which one is the privacy policy, which one is the terms and conditions or disclaimer. We'll talk about terms and conditions in a little bit. But but you want to keep them separate. And also, even when you're, for example, going for an ad network, they're going to scan your website.

[00:17:41.540] - Amira
They're going to want to see that you have legal pages on there or not. And you just want to make it easy for them, easy for your readers, easy for your visitors to be able to kind of find these pages, because once again, if there's ever a dispute, there's ever an issue. These are the pages that they're going to refer to. So make it transparent, make it easier to be found, and then don't try to just hide them in this one little page and that people can't really figure out and understand.

[00:18:10.310] - Liz
Yeah, I think that's a good point. Ad networks review it, but also affiliate programs and they may require additional disclaimers. Amazon's famous for requiring a specific disclosure for their affiliate links. So be aware like you can get kicked out of affiliate programs if you're not following their rules, actually read the terms and conditions you agree to when sign up for affiliate programs.

[00:18:34.130] - Amira
Yeah, absolutely.

[00:18:36.830] - Amira
I mean, you have to, it's just one of those things, because a lot of times, even in my Facebook group, I get this question like so many times Amira- can I do this for so-and-so's affiliate program's image or can I do that? And I'm like, don't ask me, go check their affiliate terms and conditions because everyone's going to have different rules and regulations as to what they can, what you can do with their products. Right.

[00:18:58.640] - Amira
Some people allow you to, for example, create a Pinterest pin as an affiliate Pin, but others probably don't. And I've been actually part of those affiliate programs that don't allow you to create an affiliate Pin for their product.

[00:19:11.330] - Amira
So my point is that you definitely want to take a look at that affiliate agreement or affiliate terms and conditions.

[00:19:16.490] - Liz
Pay attention to more than just the cookie length and the payout terms,

[00:19:21.890] - Amira
Yes, especially when it comes to how you're going to use, how are you going to promote that product and how you're going to use their intellectual property, their images and things like that. So, yes, you do want to pay attention to all that stuff so that you're not violating any of their rules and getting kicked out.

[00:19:35.910] - Liz
Yes, no. OK, so we mentioned terms and conditions briefly. Let's dive into that what it is, why bloggers might need it. There's a lot that it can encompass I know.

[00:19:47.620] - Amira
Absolutely. So the terms and conditions think of them like the website rules, right? What you permit, what you don't allow on your website. You may have also heard of them as terms of purchase or terms of use.

[00:19:59.930] - Amira
They're used interchangeably. A lot of people think that, OK, if I'm not selling any products or services, I don't really need terms and conditions. That's not true, although it does definitely help that if you are selling any products or services, you do need terms and conditions. But even if you weren't, you still need them because it covers so many important aspects of your site. Like, for example, what's what's going to happen if there's tomorrow an issue with your reader or with your customer or anybody?

[00:20:27.200] - Amira
Where are you going to resolve that, like legal issue? Like, for example, I live in Florida. I don't know where you live Liz, but if we have an issue, where, your terms and conditions are going to kind of govern, like where you would like that to be resolved because you're binding them to that by putting them on your site. So the point is that there's so many important things, for example, like what people can do with your intellectual property, how can they use your stuff and use something that you would outline in your terms and conditions, what's the intended age of people that visit your website again, something that you would outline in your terms and conditions and so many other important things.

[00:21:05.220] - Amira
And we're going to, again, spend like I hope I can write a whole blog post,

[00:21:08.010] - Liz
we could pretty much spend 30 minutes just on terms and conditions for you and how you use your intellectual property. I feel like a place you see this a lot is like with food bloggers and craft bloggers, especially when they do round up posts or if anyone does a round up a post and they want to round up to other people's content and they just grab the image. And that may not, they may not allow that.

[00:21:28.140] - Liz
And so you need to check with them. If it, if they don't specifically outline it in their terms and conditions, which if they're smart, they will because then they don't have to answer questions about all the time. You know, you can use one for like a round up, but you can't use it in this way. There's a lot of different things, you need permission. And that's getting into copyright and trademark and like you said, intellectual property. But, you know, it's really saying my house, my rules.

[00:21:51.990] - Liz
So if I don't want to approve a comment or if I don't want to or if I want to delete one that's been approved or it's really it's, it's, you're saying my house, my rules. And here's what it is. You can take it or leave it. Right. And that's always how I like to think of it.

[00:22:06.360] - Amira
Yeah, I know. Exactly. And that's the nice, easy way of explaining it.

[00:22:10.710] - Liz
Yeah. So I mean, and if you are doing products and services, you're going to be that's where you're going to have like your refund policy and all that information.

[00:22:20.790] - Amira
Yeah,

[00:22:21.420] - Liz
You don't want you don't want there to be any ambiguity there.

[00:22:24.660] - Amira
Oh, yeah, exactly. Because before, you know it like then you'll be having to then refund and return stuff. If you didn't outline it in your terms and conditions and you didn't have people click to accept them before purchasing.

[00:22:35.250] - Amira
That's another point I want to make, is that when you have your terms and conditions, make sure that on your checkout page that people are actually clicking to, they've got a chance to review it, even whether they review it or not, that's on them. But at least you've given them the chance to take a look at your terms and conditions so that later on they can. For example, if you don't offer refunds later on, you don't want to be liable to refund the product price if, if that's what your terms and conditions say.

[00:23:01.170] - Amira
But if they didn't agree to it, then then you will be for your terms and conditions don't include those policies. Then again, you'll be you'll be forced to get... And that has happened with a couple of people that I know. They didn't have terms and conditions and they had to refund two thousand dollars product. And yeah, it happens. I mean, it happens all the time. And outside of the blogging world, too, like even practicing as a lawyer, I've seen tons and tons of issues that my clients face.

[00:23:25.260] - Amira
And again, it goes back to not having proper legal policies and, on their on their website, especially if it's an online business.

[00:23:33.330] - Liz
Yeah. It's not to say you can't change your policy later if you decide that what you have now, isn't currently working for you. But I wouldn't, you want to kind of abide by your own rules a little bit, like if you say there's a 14 day refund policy, stick to it. If's day 15, your like I'm really sorry, it cuts off at 14 days, you know, like stick your own rules. I know that. I know we always want to, a lot of people want to be people pleasers and, you know, try to do everything.

[00:23:59.280] - Liz
And I mean, there's a line right, where you want to obviously make customer happy. But just keep that in mind, because if you're bending the rules and that's going to be harder to enforce them later.

[00:24:09.570] - Amira
Yes. Yeah, exactly. So, yeah, that's why you need to be very clear. Like you said, make sure that your terms are clear and people can actually understand them. Yes, absolutely.

[00:23:59.280] - Liz
So we've talked about getting templates from lawyers. I know you have a fantastic legal bundle that people should absolutely check out. When she says she's helped tons, she really hundreds, thousands, whatever. You know, I don't know the exact number, but I I've heard about her for years. But you also are giving away a free legal guide. Can you tell us a little more about that? The link to that, to both those things will be below, but or to the right.

[00:24:46.920] - Liz
I'm not sure which side there will be on the screen. But what what can you tell us a little bit about that legal guide nd what people can expect of it?

[00:24:55.050] - Amira
Yeah, absolutely. So a legal guide is basically like your foundation guide when you're starting your blog, you want to make sure that you're covering yourself. So it's going to cover all the things that we talked about. But just kind of in a summary, like conclude like a nice conclusion so that this way you don't feel overwhelmed.

[00:25:13.290] - Amira
So it's going to talk about like the three mistakes that I do see entrepreneurs making all the time. And then I also give you solutions how to avoid them. And as Liz mentioned, if you need legal templates or any legal help with any kind of business, then yes, definitely reach out. There's so much information on my blog, on my website. And yeah, I mean, there's a lot of stuff to go through, and I'm happy to help any time.

[00:25:37.980] - Liz
Yes. So thank you so much. So just aselfguru.com. She has a great website. You probably see her all over social media and Pinterest. I know I do, but thank you Amira so much. Any final words you want to add or information to include that we haven't covered?

[00:25:55.080] - Amira
Yeah, I mean, outside of what we covered, the only tip that I would give to fellow bloggers is that when it comes to like, there are three things that I absolutely don't compromise on and I think you can agree on with me on this, Liz, is that three things like when it comes to the legal stuff, when it comes to your taxes, and when it comes to your health. I feel like those three, all three have serious detrimental consequences on your life and they can really make you lose your sleep very quickly.

[00:26:21.420] - Amira
And I'm speaking from experience because my dad as an entrepreneur was sued and I wasn't a lawyer yet. That's one of the reasons I am a lawyer today. And he were sued for ninety thousand dollars and we didn't see that lawsuit coming from anywhere we could have never imagined. But it did turn our world upside down. We lost our sleep. We lost our appetite. And that entire lawsuit lasted like more than a year. So I when I say that, you know, lawsuits happen and they're scary, I'm not just saying that as a lawyer.

[00:26:51.240] - Amira
I'm saying that from personal experience, having gone through that with my father, helping him navigate through the legalities and the and how devastating that was. And I'm not sharing this story to scare anyone. I'm only sharing this story to just let you know that I know where I'm coming from. Right. So having experienced that hardship. So that's one of the, that's why I always tell, like fellow bloggers and entrepreneurs that when it comes to the legal stuff, don't think that, oh, I'm just a small blogger.

[00:27:15.750] - Amira
I'm this... lawsuits will come in all shapes and forms. Right.

[00:27:20.850] - Amira
And then same thing with your taxes, right? Like, you just want to stay on top of that. And then, of course, your health is your wealth. So, yeah, those are the only three things that I would just share with you and tell you that you should not go. You shouldn't cut corners on, you shouldn't compromise on something that you should take seriously. So take the right steps to protect your blog from the beginning.

[00:27:40.140] - Liz
Yes, I love that. I, I fully agree with that. Thank you so much, everyone. Go check out aselfguru.com. And thank you so much. I really appreciate you taking the time.

[00:27:51.750] - Amira
Oh, I really appreciate you, Liz. I mean, it's so refreshing to see another lawyer interviewing a lawyer. I think that it is so nice to see that collaboration over competition. So I think you're doing a phenomenal job.

[00:27:51.750] - Liz
All right, guys, we'll catch ya the next session.
