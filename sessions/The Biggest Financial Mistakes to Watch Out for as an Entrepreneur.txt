Hi, my name is Sylvia Inks and I'm the founder of SMI Financial Coaching. I'm so excited that you are here. I've worked with and seen many entrepreneurs who were great at what they do. They've got a great product. They've got a great service, but they're secretly struggling with the finances in their business. Today, I want to share with you the biggest financial mistakes to watch out for as an entrepreneur.

[00:00:41.590] - Sylvia
A few key things to keep in mind. Being great with your personal finances does not automatically mean that you were great with business finances. I've seen both new and experienced entrepreneurs make some or all of these mistakes. And I've also worked with six figure business owners who have made some of these mistakes. So, let's get started.

[00:01:07.830] - Sylvia
Here's a quick overview of what I will be covering. One introduction. Two common goals of small business owners versus the reality. Next, I'll do the seven financial mistakes. Then I'll do a recap, including a list of action items, if you find that you were making one or more of these mistakes and then I have a bonus for you if you stick with me until the end. So, let's get started.

[00:01:37.360] - Sylvia
So, who am I? Again, my name is Sylvia Inks. I am a coach for coaches, consultants and service based business owners and the author of the book "Small Business Finance for the Busy Entrepreneur". And I help entrepreneurs save and make more money by creating additional income streams in their business.

[00:02:01.950] - Sylvia
Three common goals that I see, almost all small business owners have, one, make money, otherwise it's called a hobby. To save time. And three, reduce stress. However, the reality is most small business owners are not making the money that they need or want in their business.

[00:02:27.980] - Sylvia
They're not saving time, they're actually working more hours than they ever expected. And they're not reducing stress, they're actually more stressed than ever before.

[00:02:39.990] - Sylvia
So, now let's dive into the seven biggest mistakes and how avoiding these mistakes will actually help you reach one or all three of these goals to make more money, save time and reduce stress.

[00:02:56.150] - Sylvia
Mistake number one, co-mingling your personal business money when you worked in corporate America, did you ever loan your boss or the company money? Assuming the answer is no, if you would never do that in your corporate job, then why are you doing that in your own small business? Remember that the business in you and your personal life, these should be kept separate. Now, if you've been making this mistake and you've been co-mingling your funds and if you are ever audited by the IRS, you could one day lose the legal protection on your business and to get fined and have to pay a penalty and interest fees if any of the expenses had been incorrectly flagged as a business expense but was actually a personal expense.

[00:03:48.720] - Sylvia
So, I'm actually going to share a couple realized stories with you. I had one six figure business owner tell me that she used the personal family checking account for her business when she was starting out because it was just a part time business. A couple of years later, she felt extremely guilty when she realized that she had accidentally spent more money on the business than the business had brought in. That meant she accidentally spent the family vacation money and money that was actually supposed to be set aside for the kids sports and activity.

[00:04:29.290] - Sylvia
Another example, I had a business owner tell me that every December her husband would hand her a highlighter and a physical printout of all their credit card statements for the year and asked her to highlight one by one which ones were business expenses so he could claim it on their taxes. Yikes! So, keep in mind, make sure that you have a business checking account and a separate business credit card or debit card to run your business, and having a business checking account does not mean that you have not accidentally been co-mingling your personal and business finances.

[00:05:07.260] - Sylvia
For example, if you have a business credit card and you are using it to pay for personal expenses as a form of paycheck to yourself, then that's actually co-mingling. And so this becomes a major issue if you are ever audited by the IRS. So just make sure that you don't do it.

[00:05:27.870] - Sylvia
Mistake number two, not having an emergency fund or savings fund for the business. Most people hear about having a emergency fund for their personal finances. So, they do this for their personal money and shop around for the best rates and the best accounts. But for their business, I find that many small business owners keep all of their money in one checking account. So, by keeping the money separate and having a separate account, it just gives you that mental permission to spend or invest when you know that you have enough money set aside for emergencies and by keeping it in a separate account, you can't accidentally spend it on non emergencies.

[00:06:13.380] - Sylvia
So, I want to share with you a couple real life examples. So, I had a client who was consistently keeping around $70,000 in her one checking account. She didn't feel like she had enough money to open multiple accounts. But after working together, she opened a savings account just for the business emergency and she made $35 in the first month. And she also shared that it did it allowed her to easily see how much money she had to invest in business opportunities when they came up.

[00:06:44.530] - Sylvia
I also know another business owner who ran a pretty lean business, she didn't have a lot of monthly operating expenses, but then her father suddenly passed away and she decided to step away from the business for about two months to grieve and be there for her family. So, even though she wasn't working, she still had monthly bills to pay, including all her monthly subscriptions. And she also had to cancel a workshop that she had already collected money for and had already spent the money.

[00:07:15.490] - Sylvia
And so when she offered to reschedule the workshop in the future, some of those clients and customers asked for a refund. And that was money that she did not have.

[00:07:30.650] - Sylvia
Mistake number three, not having tax money automatically taken out. So, if you worked in corporate America, the company does this for you. When you start a job at your hands, you form a tax form to complete. And so the company does this for you and takes the taxes out before it gives you your paycheck. And so when you start and have your own business, remember that you are the company. You need to make sure that you take taxes out before you pay the rest of your bills and yourself because you don't want to be empty handed when it comes time to pay your quarterly taxes or your monthly sales tax, because this can cause a lot of stress. If you realize too late that there isn't enough money in the checking account to pay the taxes.

[00:08:22.670] - Sylvia
Mistake number four, willing to work for free, a.k.a. not having a paycheck. A lot of small business owners tell me that they haven't paid themselves yet. They gave me lots of reasons, including the business isn't making enough money yet or sales fluctuate. So, I don't know how much I can pay myself. Or they pay them so sporadically throughout the year and say whenever I look in the checking account, if there's enough money, I'll pay myself a paycheck. But having this money mindset can actually hold you back even if your business is doing better and making six figures. Because I've known small business owners who do have a six figure business, but they haven't paid themselves a steady paycheck for owners drop and it's for not for lack of money coming in. So, let me ask you, would you work for another company without the promise of a paycheck? I'm assuming the answer is no, but even if you had a sales job that was 100% commission, you would be expected to be paid based on your results, right? If that's the case, when you start your own business, why wouldn't you treat yourself the same way? So, essentially think of yourself as employee number one of your small business.

[00:09:44.850] - Sylvia
Mistake number five, lowering your prices and discounting on the fly. Just don't do it. It is harder to increase your prices afterwards. If you were in corporate America, you wouldn't lower your asking salary when applying for a new job. Right. Because you know what you're worth and you know how much money that you need to be making in order to pay your mortgage, utilities, food and other bills. However, I find many small business owners do not know how much it costs to keep the lights on in their business. They don't know how much they need to be making in order to be able to pay their bills and themselves. So, then when they get into sales conversations, they start getting nervous talking about money, especially if money hasn't been coming in and they tend to lower their prices or even give discounts on the fly.

[00:10:42.450] - Sylvia
Mistake number six, trying to do it all. Well, you may feel like you can't afford help and you just can bootstrap the business at the beginning, trying to run the entire business by yourself can actually cost you more money, either an actual cost or opportunity cost. For example, I had a client who was behind in managing her inventory system. She didn't want to pay anyone to help her. But then she found herself in situations where a customer would purchase a product on her website and be given a delivery date. But then she realized that she was out of stock of some of the materials that she needed to complete the product. Then she would have to pay for rush shipping fees to get the material sent to her house so she could make the product and then she would have to pay rush shipping fees in order to get it to the customer on time and buy the promised delivery date. And when we calculated this, we found that she often paid around twenty five to upwards of fifty dollars in these rush shipping fees. So, in the end, she actually didn't make money and sometimes lost money on these shipping fees. So, all she needed to do was hire some temporary help to get her up to speed so that she didn't get herself in these situations.

[00:12:05.470] - Sylvia
So, here are a few recommendations for how you can buy back more time for yourself and the business, outsource work if you are getting behind or you're doing tasks that aren't in your line of genius.

[00:12:20.320] - Sylvia
A great resource is a site called Upwork. I've hired people that are, you know, website developers as well as a graphic designer marketing person. You can post a job description or a description of the project that you need help with and then you can just wait for people to apply. Also, use a scheduling tool to book your meetings with prospects, clients and colleagues.

[00:12:48.270] - Sylvia
How many of you have ever had to trade three to five emails or even more to try to find a date and time that worked for both of you? Right. I've actually had that happen to me once where I lost a prospect. I lost a sale because it took way too long to find a date and time to meet. On the last email exchange, she said, "Thank you for your time, but already found somebody that I could meet with sooner and I've already hired them." So, you may be losing out on sales that you're not even aware of. My favorite tool- scheduling tool is "Book Like a Boss".

[00:13:26.440] - Sylvia
Next, make sure you budget for a virtual assistant sooner than you think in your business. You know, you may be doing some administrative tasks, you know, that are ten dollars, or maybe you could find somebody for ten dollars an hour to do. And by outsourcing that, you can make even more money in your business because it buys you back that extra hour to go spend on your business and get in front of clients and make a sale.

[00:13:53.000] - Sylvia
Also, use a social media scheduling tool. Everyone knows that you need to be on social media, but find a tool that will help you automate a share evergreen content. So, that way you're not spending your time or paying for a social media manager to only create and post content once.

[00:14:12.500] - Sylvia
My favorite tool is called Meet Edgar, you can load in content once, especially if it's evergreen and it can share it. And basically like a jukebox, it will go through the content and will randomly go through and repost the ones app that runs out.

[00:14:31.440] - Sylvia
Mistake number seven, only accepting cash or checks. So, I am not a fan of requiring customers and clients to pay only by cash or checks just so that you can avoid the credit card fees.

[00:14:45.900] - Sylvia
A few main reasons why I do not like cash or checks: One, other business owners that they hire you, they will have to send you a ten ninety nine every January if they pay you over a certain threshold in one calendar year. Two, bad checks, I've seen business owners who have received bad checks from clients, and so when the checks balance, there are return check fees that you have to pay. So, essentially, you have to pay the penalty for cashing a bad check. And while you can always follow up with a customer to pay you, you do run the risk of never getting that money, especially for work that you've already delivered. And three, it typically just takes longer to get paid if you don't accept credit cards, because requiring cash or checks is just inconvenient for your customers. You are now asking them to find a physical check, put a stamp on an envelope and mail it to you. So, if they get your invoice when they're on vacation, you're not getting paid until they get back. And so if it takes you longer to get paid, you do run the risk that you aren't able to pay your own bills on time and you may end up incurring a late fee or interest fee.

[00:16:07.010] - Sylvia
Given that I don't like cash or checks, I do want to share a few tools that do make it easy for customers to pay. One is PayPal almost everyone knows and has PayPal these days. Two, Square. Three, Fresh Books, and this is an alternative to what a lot of people know is quick books.

[00:16:31.810] - Sylvia
So, PayPal and Square are great for point of sale. So, if you've got a line of, say, 30 people that are standing in line to buy your book at the end of a presentation. Square is great because you can use a device to swipe a credit card and be able to quickly take money. You can't easily do that with a tool like Fresh Books. Fresh Books you would have to create a customer in the system first, then be able to attach an invoice to that customer and have them pay. So, having Fresh Books only wouldn't be good if you do have those point of sale type transactions.

[00:17:05.080] - Sylvia
Now, the great thing about having a tool like fresh books are books over. Just having PayPal or Square is that these accounting tools do have system reports that they can generate like your profit and loss statement. Your P&L statement is what your CPA needs to do your taxes every year until you can also get reports in these accounting tools to help you figure out where, let's say, outstanding invoices. How much do you have? An outstanding invoices may be able to quickly resend those invoices so you can set up- I personally use Fresh Books and I have a system generate reminders. So, I will say, "You know, send a reminder to the customer three days, one day, you know, before the invoices do." And, "Hey, send a reminder, three days after the invoice is past due." Then you can also my favorite feature is to tack on an automatic late fee. You can say that invoices so many days pass due, the system automatically generates either a percentage or flat fee, late fee to the customer.

[00:18:14.480] - Sylvia
So, here's a recap of the biggest mistakes. One, comingling personal and business money. Two, not having an emergency fund or savings fund for the business. Three, not having tax money automatically being taken out. Four, being willing to work for free a.k.a no paycheck. Five, lowering your prices and discounting on the fly. Six, trying to do it all. And seven, only accepting cash or checks.

[00:18:53.180] - Sylvia
So, if you've been making any these mistakes, then here are your action items to avoid these expensive financial mistakes:

[00:19:01.730] - Sylvia
One opened a separate business bank account for your operating expenses.

[00:19:07.700] - Sylvia
Open one business, bank account for your business emergency fund.

[00:19:13.620] - Sylvia
Next, open a separate business bank account for your taxes and then create a system to regularly transfer money into this account, and you'll want to check with your CPA on that amount four set up, an automatic payment or transfer at least one time a month for your owners, draw or paycheck.

[00:19:35.610] - Sylvia
Next, calculate your cost of goods sold and the time involved so that you know what your minimum asking price should be for all your products and services to ensure a profit. Outsource tasks that you can hire someone to do cheaper and faster. And then allow customers to pay by credit cards and then account for those processing fees when you do your pricing.

[00:20:05.440] - Sylvia

[00:20:20.890] - Sylvia
So, what questions do you have? Have you been making any of these financial mistakes? Let's take a look at some of the common questions that I often get, which may be the same as some of your questions.

[00:20:33.940] - Sylvia
Question number one on co-mingling. Can I just use my business credit card to pay for personal expenses and claim that as an org draw? That's still co-mingling and it gets messy because there's a higher chance that you will forget that that expense was for personal reasons and then you or your accountant will accidentally count that towards business expenses for tax deductions. Then if you were ever audited by the IRS, you will have to pay a penalty as well as late interest fees. So, just don't co-mingle.

[00:21:10.610] - Sylvia
Question number two, emergency fund, can I just use my personal emergency fund if there are unexpected emergencies in the business? Remember, you want to treat the business as a completely separate entity from you and your personal life, because if both of you have emergency, who wins? Who gets to spend the money?

[00:21:34.350] - Sylvia
Question number three, tax fun, does this separate account for taxes need to be a checking account or savings account? So, the IRS and I believe most, if not all the states will allow you to pay your taxes directly from a checking or savings account; so it can be either. Just keep in mind that most savings accounts, they do have a maximum number of withdrawals per month. So, as long as you don't think you're going to go over that amount, then you can go with a savings account so you can earn that higher interest.

[00:22:10.330] - Sylvia
Question number four, paying yourself. What if I'm not sure I can pay myself the same amount every month? We have two options. Number one, treat yourself like any other expense in the business and you can just start off small. You could even go with fifty to one hundred dollars a month and then you can start to increase that as you start to feel more confident and have more money coming in. Option number two, you can always choose to pay yourself a set percentage of last month's profits, for example, 25% of last month's profit. So, then every month you would calculate all of the prior month's profit and then just cut yourself a 25%. owners draw check.

[00:22:56.740] - Sylvia
Question number five, discounting. What should I do with existing clients if I've been discounting too much for my services? I have two recommendations there. Number one, tell your existing clients that your prices will be going up effective X date, and then just give them plenty of notice. Number two, stop discounting and focus on how you can add more value to the services that you offer to justify those higher prices.

[00:23:29.000] - Sylvia
Question number six, outsourcing, how do I know what I can afford to hire someone to help me? I recommend that you calculate your yield per hour, essentially, if you spend one hour on the business, how much money could you earn and then compare that to all the tasks that you were doing in the business and look at those tasks that you're currently good doing that you aren't good at or don't like to do. And then next, find out how much it cost to hire someone to do those tasks, and if you could hire someone to do the task for significantly lower than your yield per hour, then you can't afford to not hire someone. That's when you have to outsource so, you could spend that extra hour on your business and make more money.

[00:24:17.550] - Sylvia
Question number seven, cash or checks, what invoicing and accounting system do you recommend? I recommend Fresh Books because it's easy to learn and it doesn't require you to pay an accountant or CPA to help you set it up unlike Quick Books. And Fresh Books, was a specifically designed for freelancers and service based business owners. In my business, I use Fresh Books for my coaching services and then I do. You square for people purchasing my books at networking events and then I just connect Square to my Facebook account.
