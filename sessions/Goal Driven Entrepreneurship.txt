Cara Harvey [00:00:12]:
My name is Cara Harvey, and I am excited to welcome you to my session on goal driven entrepreneurship today. If we've never met before, hey. Nice to meet you. Thanks for hanging out. I'm gonna let you know I talk pretty fast. So if you can pause me, pause me. If you have access to an upgrade, you're gonna wanna get it and you're gonna wanna take notes because I'm gonna give you so many good tips on starting, growing, and setting your business up for success. But a little about me, I am a coffee lover, way too many cups a day, book obsessed.

Cara Harvey [00:00:40]:
I think I just hit book 18, just a few months into the year, and I'm a mom of 3. My kids are 6, 8, and 17. I am a former burnt out school teacher turned entrepreneur. I taught special education at the high school level for about 9 years, and it's wild to think about it that I am now currently 10 years out of the classroom. But I use a lot of the same techniques that I used when I was in the classroom with the moms that I coached today, and I call myself an accidental entrepreneur. I didn't mean to start my business, and it happened because I was tired. I was so burnt out and overwhelmed in education. I left to go full time into network marketing, and it looked really successful until it didn't.

Cara Harvey [00:01:18]:
Right? I was carrying my laptop around waiting to be at inbox 0. I just couldn't figure out how to run a business where I didn't feel like I had to hustle all the time. And I just couldn't find anything out there that addressed my life as a mom and as somebody who wanted to have a business. Everything was either very you know, if you wanna have a business, you gotta get up at 5 AM, you gotta hustle, but didn't take into account that I was up all night breastfeeding or that I stay up late talking to my teenager and all those things that happen as a mom. And so I started it myself. About six and a half years ago, I started my business, A Purpose Driven Mom. I am the host of The Purpose Driven Mom podcast, the author of the book, The 15 Minute Formula, and I've used my methods to impact over 20,000 moms in my programs, in my courses, and at my events. And I wanna let you know that whether you're a mom or not, the stuff that I'm gonna talk to you about today is gonna help you feel like you could grow your business with less hustle, with less shame, and move out of that, action paralysis and into an action that moves and grows and pushes the needle.

Cara Harvey [00:02:18]:
Alright? Here's what we're gonna cover today in our fast and furious time together. We're gonna talk about how goals can drive your business, and we all know about goal setting. I'm gonna teach you a specific way to craft goals that will leave you not feeling overwhelmed, moving forward, and actually intentional about your business, and what I believe is the best way to set your goals up for success. I know that there are a lot of people out there. We teach the smart goals, things like that. We're not gonna talk smart goals today. We're gonna talk category goals, and it's a little bit different than you might have heard. So I want you to know that sometimes less is more, and that is okay.

Cara Harvey [00:02:51]:
Alright? And maybe you've been here. Is this what business looks like for you? Right? I go this way. I go that way. I don't know what to work on, and then I'm confused. And then I get scrambled because I have so many things that I have to work on. So I'm feeling overwhelmed, and I'm feeling lost, and I'm not sure what to do. I've been there, again, six and a half years into the business. There are still days where I struggle with this, but so much less now because I've come up with a framework.

Cara Harvey [00:03:15]:
And that's what I'm gonna teach you today. So if you've been in this spot or trying to start, grow, or scale a business feels like this because you don't know what to work on, buckle up because that's what we're gonna cover today. Alright? We're gonna talk today about a goal driven business. What a goal driven business is where we start with a vision. Right? Right over here. We're saying, what do I want this to look like? Where do I wanna go? We then move into the plan. And I know that the plan isn't the sexy thing. It's not the fun thing.

Cara Harvey [00:03:41]:
It's not what wants to do, but the plan is what's going to drive you to the next stage, which is the do. And we're gonna talk about how do you set your schedule up for success. And then the rinse and repeat. How do you do it so you don't just one and done this? Right? Oh, I had a really have you ever had that where you have a really great month and you make all your goals and your plan, you're feeling good, but then you never duplicate it because it felt like, quote, too much to do. I'm gonna talk today about how to make and create this goal driven business. Okay? So we're gonna talk about 4 stages, and our first one is vision casting. I love vision casting because it allows us to define what success means like. It says, this is what my goal should be because it's important to me, not because I see some other guru on the Internet talk about it, not because I think that's what I'm supposed to be.

Cara Harvey [00:04:23]:
It's because this is where I'm supposed to be. Alright? So I want you to pretend like it's the end of the year or even the end of the month. That's sometimes that's too big for people. Sometimes thinking too far out is, like, too much. So even think of the end of the month. What do you wanna feel like in your business? I wanna feel accomplished. I wanna feel like I was productive. I wanna feel successful because like, what are all those things you wanna feel? I want you to write it down.

Cara Harvey [00:04:45]:
What will business look like for you where it feels good? What is that successful feeling? And we start with our feelings because when we jump right into making the concrete goals, it's very easy to get derailed if we don't know why we're doing it. Now I don't think your why is the only thing, but I think having a vision can help. I also want you to think about a word that might resonate how you wanna feel in your business. We call this the word of the month, word of the quarter, word of the year. This word allows you to pause and say, you know what? I really feel like I know what I wanna do, what I want this to look like, and I can run it through this filter. If I said the word productive, you could probably draw a picture of what a productive work would look like for you. If I my word this year is ease. Right? So what does ease look like? What does it feel like in my business? And then you ask yourself these questions.

Cara Harvey [00:05:32]:
If this doesn't bring me, insert my word, is it aligned for my business? And the answer can be yes or no. You can choose. Some months, my word is push. Some months, my word is rest. It really depends on what you want for your business. So I want you to think of your word. And in the vision casting, I also want you to think through what your day to day would look like if you showed up for that word. If I showed up for the word ease, would I drop my kids off, run home, rush, grab my coffee, and sit right at my desk, and just work, work, work until I pick them up? Maybe not.

Cara Harvey [00:06:02]:
If I use the word ease, what I try to do now is I drop them off, I grab my coffee, and then I sit, and I do personal development book, and I journal for 15 minutes, and I start my day with intentions. I'm not rushing it. Say my word was push, then it might look like that. And there's no right or wrong. There's no yes or no. But I want you to know that it can feel how you want it to feel, but you have to pre identify what actions you want to show to be able to show up in that way. I also want you to ask in your vision setting, what do you need to stop doing? If I wanna show up as a business owner who is productive, I need to stop having 30 minutes a day where I'm scrolling my TikTok mindlessly. I would need to stop not going into a day with with a plan.

Cara Harvey [00:06:43]:
Right? If I wanna show up as a business owner who is powerful, right, I need to stop second guessing every decision that I make. Right? I need to stop, procrastinating on certain things. What do you need to stop doing in order to have the success that you want? And what thoughts might you have to get, get rid of? Right? What are the thoughts you currently have that are in your way of fulfilling my word? If my word was we'll say powerful again. Right? I wanna be a powerful business owner. I wanna make powerful decisions. That's how I wanna feel. Well, the thought of imposter syndrome, the thought of I'm never good enough, the thought of I can't do that. We gotta get that out of the way.

Cara Harvey [00:07:19]:
Right? We need to remove that because that is gonna get in the way of you fulfilling the success you wanna have. So in your vision setting, in your vision casting, I want you to stop and do these things. I want you and, again, pause if you can. Journal through these questions. Ask yourself, what do I want success to look like? Because we're gonna make the plan now. I'm gonna show you different ways to make goals. But if you don't start with your vision, it's easy to get swept away. It's easy to say, well, this person, you know, Cara said success is this, so I must do this.

Cara Harvey [00:07:49]:
If you are solid and if you are concrete in what you want your business to look like, then it is easy for you to do these things. Alright? So go through, make your vision, and now we're gonna make the plan. This is the meat and the potatoes. This is the big stuff, but I'm gonna teach you planning not in the smart goals way, which, again, nothing wrong with smart goals, but I'm gonna teach you in a different way, and I'm gonna tell you why. The plan is how you get there. A lot of times we will make goals. We will put too many goals on our plate. We will not be focused in the right directions, and then we will get scattered in our business.

Cara Harvey [00:08:21]:
Instead, what I want you to do is follow my framework. I want you to make habits, dream, learn, plan, and a do goal. And these are gonna be different every single month. So one of the things I do in my planning is I will do this quarterly where I will kind of look through the next 3 months, and I will plan out things. Because if I was to put every goal that I wanted to work with on this, I would have 800 goals I was working on, and then nothing would happen because I would be overwhelmed. Right? And then I wouldn't move forward at all. But instead, I want you very intentionally to make goals set for your business that are aligned, and this will also allow you to backwards plan. If 3 months out, I know that my, quote, do goal is to launch a podcast, well, then I know that 2 months out, I should be planning, and 3 months out, I should be learning, and 4 months out, I should be dreaming.

Cara Harvey [00:09:10]:
Right? This is how you set yourself up for success. So I'm gonna go through each of these, and I'm gonna talk to you about a little bit of a different goal you can have for each of these sections. Okay? First up is habit goals. Now why do we create why do we create monthly habit goals? Like, why do we, make these goals for habits? We have to show up for our business a certain way to be the person we wanna become. So when you create a monthly habit goal, it lets you focus on changing your brain, changing your mindset, changing who you think you are into becoming the person you'd like to become, and we do that by daily habits. We want to look at the shiny angle and say, oh, I got to the end. I'm accomplished. I've done that.

Cara Harvey [00:09:51]:
But it's not about that. It's about the steps we take along the way to become that person. So you need to create a monthly habit goal, and I want you to pick 1 habit a month to work on. Now this doesn't mean it's the only thing you work on. If I made a goal last month of showing up on Instagram, this month, the habit of Instagram isn't going away. It's just not my main focus because now it's become a habit. I might not have to track it. I might not have to worry about it as much.

Cara Harvey [00:10:18]:
Alright? But when you pick one habit to focus on that month, you can track, you can get great results, you can collect data, and you can be focused instead of, well, I've got to be on TikTok and Instagram and Twitter and Pinterest and all these places. We're gonna pick 1. So these are just some great examples of habit based goals. Right? Social media posting, like I mentioned, pick one social media platform to focus on. Then say you do TikTok this month. Cool. Ask yourself, what's the next social media habit I want? Well, let's just do Instagram reels because that's easy. I'm just really repurposing.

Cara Harvey [00:10:50]:
So maybe this month, I'm focusing TikTok, TikTok, TikTok, TikTok, and then I'm gonna add in Instagram because it's another thing to do. I'm just gonna repurpose my videos and then add in checking on stories. Because it is a second platform, it does require a little bit extra work. You don't wanna do all the habits at once because then you're gonna get overwhelmed. And then maybe month 3, you're like, alright. Well, maybe I'll do YouTube shorts now because I already have the video. It's just adding in something else and adding in something else. It lets you focus and be an expert in that area, really learn it.

Cara Harvey [00:11:18]:
You could do things like live videos. Okay? This month, I'm gonna focus on doing one live video every single week or whatever it is. Showing up for work blocks is a great habit when you're a newer beginner. Right? A new business owner or if you've kind of gotten off track with working. My habit is I'm gonna show up. So I have, 10 work blocks every single week, 9 to 12, 12 to 3, Monday through Friday when my kids are at school. They look different every week, but my goal is to show up for a certain percentage of them. Why? Because I'm working from home and it's hard.

Cara Harvey [00:11:48]:
I really like Survivor, and I wanna go watch an episode. And, I see the dishes in the sink or somebody asks me to go up for coffee. Right? It can be really hard to stay focused on the work blocks that I have. So maybe your habit is I'm gonna show up for these workbooks that I said. Writing could be 1. If you wanna write, emails or blog posts or whatever it is Or, oh, let's just say episodes is spelled wrong, but podcast episodes or blog posts. Maybe your habit is showing up that way. So I want you to pick a habit based goal for the month.

Cara Harvey [00:12:16]:
Write it down. What is the habit you wanna show up for? Alright? And now we're gonna pick the next one. That is our dream goals. These are my favorite. I think each month, you should have a different dream focus. Okay? Now why dream? Let's talk about it. A monthly dream goal is something you wanna do in the future that you just need to give your brain intentional space around. I have tons of things I wanna do.

Cara Harvey [00:12:38]:
I'm a visionary. But if I don't say to myself, today is the day that I'm gonna go for, we'll talk about dream walks a dream walk about this topic, I'm never gonna do it. I'm running an in person event in September. There's a lot of dreaming that went on. If I didn't intentionally say this is the month I'm dreaming about the in person event, I would keep putting it off and putting it off. Because, especially, I talk to moms, we have a 100 things going on. But if I can ask myself, what is something I just wanna give my attention to? And I'm not only my attention, but my intuition, but my myself, my brain, my, my thoughts, my dreaming. We don't want your dreams to keep getting pushed off.

Cara Harvey [00:13:11]:
Do you make a monthly dream goal? So here's some, steps on how I kind of dream intentionally, a dream walk. I'm gonna go for 1 when we're done here recording this. I'm putting my sneakers, and I say to myself, Cara, you were thinking about x y z. And I tell myself what I'm gonna think about. I'm a Christian, so I'll be like, god, I'm open to it. I'm just like, I I'm ready for whatever download you wanna give me. God, universe, whatever it is. My brain, I'm open to it.

Cara Harvey [00:13:33]:
And I take a walk. And whatever happens, whatever comes up for me, I might pull the notepad off of my phone. I might voice memo myself, and I just dream. So let's talk about this in person event. I I've done many dream walks. So one of them I was like, you know, I wanna dream about, like, what it's gonna look like, what it's gonna feel like. I literally took a dream walk. I mapped out my guest speakers.

Cara Harvey [00:13:52]:
I mapped out the agenda, what it's gonna look like, the room, how many people. I just allowed myself this beautiful download that then let me move to the next stages. If you don't give yourself time to dream, even about your habit, like, what does Instagram look like for you? Then it's easy to not make goals that make sense. You can then move to journaling. So after I dream, I will then give myself the next week 15 minutes to journal and write all these things down. I don't actually physically type, handwriting, so I will type whatever I want. Prayer or meditation, that that's a big one for me. Like, I just mentioned, I'll just be like, god, what do you think? Help me.

Cara Harvey [00:14:22]:
Like, I give this to you. Right? And having thought partners or buddies to say, like, hey. I'm dreaming about this. Can I just talk these ideas out? Having a dream goal each month will intentionally move your business forward to success because you're giving yourself space. If you know you wanna launch that podcast in 4 months, dream about it now. Right? Dream about it now because it will allow your brain to open up to the possibilities. Now once we've made our dream goal, I then want you to make a learn goal. Now if you're like me, you probably get stuck in learning where you're like, I love to learn.

Cara Harvey [00:14:51]:
I wanna take a course. I wanna do all these things. I recommend you pick one learn goal a month, and what you do with this one learn goal is that you take the course. You do the thing. I'm gonna show you how to break it down, but you don't stay in it forever. You say this is what I'm gonna learn. Now how do you pick what you're gonna learn? Well, what do you need to plan? What do you need to do? What's next on your agenda? 1 month, my dream was in person event. The next month, my learn was in person event.

Cara Harvey [00:15:18]:
So I bought a course I'm currently taking on how to host an in person event. Alright? And then next month, I'll move into planning it, and then I'll move into starting the thing, like, actually doing it. So how do you break these learning, goals down? We'll talk about in a second, but I just wanna remind you that focused learning is the key in moving forward in your business. If you're like, I'm gonna learn this, and I know and I hear this listen. I hear this from the moms I coach. They're learning junkies, so they will get on every single course. Right? You're at this event. You're watching this presentation.

Cara Harvey [00:15:49]:
I'm sure you're a learning junkie. Right? But what are you gonna take from this event and move into with your learning? Right? Where are you gonna have it go? Focused learning is the key, not just learning. Picking what it is and then moving forward. So break your learning goal down. In person event example, you pick a course. I got a course. Determine the end date. When do you want the course completed? So for me, I wanted to have my venue booked because we're preselling tickets.

Cara Harvey [00:16:15]:
So I was like, alright. I need to have these modules finished by this date. Okay? You need to pick an end date. Why pick an end date? Because if you don't, you will continue to learn. You will continue to procrastinate. You'll continue to put off. So pick an end date, then you're gonna do math. You call these numerical goals.

Cara Harvey [00:16:29]:
Divide up the lessons, the modules, and the implementation by week. Let's do some easy math examples. Say, I decided I wanted to finish my course by the end of a month. There's 20 lessons modules right inside the entire thing, 4 weeks in a month. 20 divided by 4 tells me I need to complete 5 lessons every single week in order to finish it. That's very specific. It's very driven, but it's also flexible, because I don't want you to pick the days yet. I just want you to say how many you're gonna do each week.

Cara Harvey [00:16:57]:
And then each week when you're planning it out, you can look and say, great. I know that I said I had to do these 5. Maybe you got off track, maybe you got ahead, whatever it is. Which days am I gonna watch these? Because my schedule I don't know about you. My schedule is different every day. And so because my schedule is different every day, I have to make different, schedules, different plans. This allows me to take my learning goal and make it super focused. Okay? So we talked about habits.

Cara Harvey [00:17:21]:
We talked about a dream. I told you we're gonna be fast and furious fire hose today. We talked about learning. Now let's talk about creating a plan goal. Spending time planning will save you so much time in the long run. People don't wanna do it. I don't wanna do it, Cara. I got so many other things to do.

Cara Harvey [00:17:36]:
I just wanna get the work done. But when you actually plan out, what you're doing, when it's time to sit to work, you're gonna save yourself so much time. And we're gonna talk about that in the do. Right? But what could planning look like? Okay? This is where you're like, I'm gonna do content planning. So maybe I just took a course on Instagram. So next month, I'm gonna plan my Instagram. So I'm gonna spend time in planning goals. My planning goal is gonna be that I'm gonna make my quarterly Instagram plan.

Cara Harvey [00:18:03]:
I'm gonna write out my captions. I'm gonna plan what I'm gonna talk about for stories and have it already completed. Right? It could also be things like a launch breakdown. I mentioned launching a podcast, but you could also be launching a course or doing a webinar or anything like that. It could also be social media content. Alright? So this is where you're sitting down and you're saying, I'm gonna plan next week's TikToks. Right? I'm gonna decide what my live videos are, or just general task list. So we're talking about batching in a second, but this could also just be planning out, like, what is my content gonna look like for the next quarter, what is, my batch schedule is gonna be.

Cara Harvey [00:18:37]:
Spending time making a goal of planning will allow it to feel easier. So back to the in person event. When my goal is planning the in person event, that's where I'm taking all the tasks that I need to complete to make it happen, and I'm making a breakdown for it. Right? That's when I'm doing the planning like I'm doing now where I'm picking a venue and I'm calling food suppliers and I'm deciding on my, guest speakers. Right? I'm doing all the planning stuff in inside of it. Okay? Planning is so key because if you sat and spent the time breaking down your webinar launch, for example, like, what are all the tasks I need to do in a webinar launch? When it's time to get started to work on the webinar launch, you're not thinking and left with the question of, well, what am I supposed to work on? You can just get started, and and that's what we're gonna talk about now. That's what we're talking about in the do. Alright? So goal driven success for you as an entrepreneur is not so much always just in the do.

Cara Harvey [00:19:32]:
Right? It's do I make a habit goal? Do I have time to dream, which will in turn make the rest of this easier? Am I learning what I need to learn and moving forward? Am I planning out the tasks I need to have happen? And then how am I making it happen in the do? Right? The do is your main focus project. It's where your attention is going to be. So you might say your do is the podcast. Sometimes my do is just podcast batching. I wanna finish for the quarter. You know, I always pick one focus project. Now, again, it's not saying it's the only thing I'm working on. It's saying I wanna focus my my time in that area.

Cara Harvey [00:20:06]:
So we're gonna spend a lot of time, here now in stage 3. Right? So vision setting stage 1. Stage 2, really kind of planning out what you're going to be, and then stage stage 3 is the do. Alright? So the do tasks will get broken into the daily tasks. I mentioned this already. When you plan well, you can sit down and plan, and then when it your kid takes a nap when it's after bedtime or when you do get that precious work time that is so far and few between for so many of us, you are left knowing the the plan and just following it. You're not wasting time deciding what to do. It's showing up and it's making a schedule.

Cara Harvey [00:20:51]:
Now I'm gonna talk to you about batches a little bit today. Right? That's really my secret sauce. It's creating work batches so that everything is broken down for yourself for the month so that you can actually just get started. I wanna give you some sample batches. Okay? So depending on where you're at in your business. Right? So I always go through and I look at my dream, learn, plan, do, and my habits, and I ask myself, do I have batches, categories set for them? And if I don't, I make them. Now there's also batches and categories in your business that you'll do just because you have to. Right? Not everything, like, my podcast.

Cara Harvey [00:21:26]:
Right? I record a podcast episode with over 400 episodes. Right? I don't always quote do my podcast. Sometimes I'll do batching in advance, but the podcast is just something that runs in my business. It's just something that happens. So I always have to have a podcast batch in my week, but it doesn't, always it isn't always on my learn plan do. Does that make sense? So my learn plan do isn't the all encompassing what I'm working on, but it's my daily. Right? So things like my podcast or if you have a blog or YouTube channels, things like launches or affiliates, I have CEO time, admin time, learning. Do you have a learning block? Now sometimes I do learning multitask.

Cara Harvey [00:22:05]:
So most of the time, I like to do learning, and I have a learning block. I want you to think about your business, and I want you to think about all the things that you need to get done, and go ahead and make a list. Make a list of all the batches, all the categories, all the things you might need to do because this is what's going to make your schedule for the week. Alright? And I think okay. I'm not ready. I realized I don't think I have a slide on scheduling, but I'm gonna talk through it in a second because I think it's really important. But step 1 is, what are all the things you need to get done based on the goals you made, but also based on how your business runs? Again, just because you don't have a goal for it doesn't mean it's not something you work on in your business, especially when you've been doing this for a bit and you know what has to get done. So make your list of batches and then ask yourself some questions.

Cara Harvey [00:22:49]:
What are the tasks I need to complete in these categories for next month? So if I have a YouTube channel, for example, I might write down, outline episode 1. Right? Like, let's say 4 episodes. Right? Outline episode 1, outline episode 2, outline episode 3, outline episode 4. I might say record episode 1, 2, 3, 4. I might say edit. Right? Put all those things down. Do the same for a podcast or a blog post or if you're launching. Really break down the tasks and ask yourself, what are the things I need to complete in order to get them done? Because this is how you're going to make your schedule to get you moving forward.

Cara Harvey [00:23:24]:
Again, it's not this, like, arbitrary thing where it's like I sit down to work. It's where's my focus, what do I need to do, and what are my tasks? So so make a list for yourself. What are those tasks? And what is key here is doing this before the month begins. When you do this before the month begins, what this is going to do is allow you to sit down and work and not figure out what you're supposed to be doing. So I don't have a slide for this, but I wanna talk through what you do after that. Excuse me. So once you've created your batches, what I want you to do then is I want you to plan your time using time blocking. Right? So you're gonna, go through and make a time block.

Cara Harvey [00:24:04]:
Actually, you know what? I'm screen sharing. I'm not gonna edit. Hold on. I'm gonna go through and make a new tab, and I'm gonna show you this and make this for you right now because I don't have a slide of it, but I think it would be really important for you to see it, visually. So let me just throw up a doc real quick. Alright. So here's what we're gonna do. We're gonna make a little time block, and I'm gonna show you what you do with your batches because I thought I had that slide in there, but I don't.

Cara Harvey [00:24:29]:
So we're just gonna, improvise here. Alright. So when I think time blocks, 6 okay. Here. This is how I kinda set them up. In this column, I'm gonna write what my time block is, and then we'll just do Monday through Friday for now. Okay? Alright. Time blocks are essentially, like, 3 to 4 hour chunks.

Cara Harvey [00:24:48]:
So I mentioned I have 2 time blocks I work. I work 9 to 12, and I work 12 to 3. Yours might not look like that, but maybe you have similar ones. When I'm planning my week, I go back to my goals, and then I go back to my batches, and I ask myself, hey, where can this fit? So if I know that I need to work on a goal, I need to make sure that time exists. So first up is habits. Alright. So let's say my habit is Instagram. So I should have a social media block in here multiple times a week.

Cara Harvey [00:25:18]:
It doesn't have to be every day, but multiple times a week. That was remember that that is my habits goal is social media. So let's say we're gonna work on social media. Here, we'll do it 2 times a week. Alright? So 2 times a week, I'm showing up on social media. Now you can have this more or less, but at least I know that my habits goal has a home. Right? Because if you create a goal around, I'm gonna make this goal, but I don't know where it goes, that's when it doesn't happen. So my habits goal, here we go, 2 times a week.

Cara Harvey [00:25:44]:
Maybe you want to show up more. We'll start with 2 times a week. Again, it doesn't have to be the same time or the same day. My dream goal. Alright. So once a week, I wanna work on my dreaming for this new podcast I wanna have. Well, if I don't have a a themed block to dream, it's not gonna happen. Now I wanna tell you something about the way I teach time blocking.

Cara Harvey [00:26:02]:
Just because I have a theme there does not mean that's the only thing I'm working on, but it it means that's where I'm gonna focus it. So maybe I'm not only maybe I do a dream walk or a dream journal that takes 20 minutes, not the whole block, but it's where I fit it in. So I'm gonna have, 15 minutes where I also do dream. So maybe I will couple my Monday social media block with my dream block, because maybe these things don't take long. So you can have 2 themes if you want or you can have 1. We'll say for this example, Monday morning's dream social media. Okay. It's fit.

Cara Harvey [00:26:31]:
Do I have time for my learning? I found that I needed to take 4 lessons a week. I can do that in maybe a couple hours. So I only need one learn block. Let's make that Friday mornings. Cool. Alright. Planning. Do I have a planning block once a week? I need to fit it somewhere, so let's put it in here.

Cara Harvey [00:26:50]:
And then my do is my main project AKA my batches. So if we head back to I wanna say this one. Yep. This session this presentation here, see this section? This is where I need to put these in. So now I'm gonna put my do categories. Alright. Well, I need an admin block. I love those on Mondays where I'm doing administrative stuff.

Cara Harvey [00:27:09]:
I need a podcast block, so this tells me where I'm doing podcasting. I need a launch block. Oh, and I like a good buffer block. So we'll talk about that in a second. Let's say I also have a blog, so that can go there. And let's also put in an affiliates block to work on affiliate stuff. K? I like to leave at least one block open, and I call that buffer. I love it midweek or the end of the week.

Cara Harvey [00:27:34]:
What is it for? It's for the stuff that doesn't get done that I said I was going to do. It's for all the stuff I had on this list that didn't make it. I know there's a place for it to go. It's also for the stuff that I think about that I need to get done that week. Okay? So I want you to see how this all connects in the do phase. Right? We went through and made a vision. You said, what do you want this to look like? Where is it gonna be for you? Cool. You know where you wanna go.

Cara Harvey [00:27:57]:
You then went through the planning phase and you planned out your goals. You decided what they look like, and then you moved into the do phase where you've broken down your work batches. You figured out your task, and then you've created a schedule each week that can look different where you're saying this is where my goals are gonna go. This is my super intentional super intentional place I'm gonna go. Right? So what happens next? Well, it's it's step 4, and that's rinse and repeat. So this is where we create a system. This is where you make your goals monthly. Alright? So the 3rd week of every single month, I repeat this process, and I adjust it.

Cara Harvey [00:28:34]:
So I'm always kind of a little bit ahead. Right? The 3rd week of every month, I look at the next month and I ask myself what habit do I wanna work on? Did the habit I pitch, does that need a little bit more love, or can I move on? Can I add to it? Do I do I need more time to dream, or can I move that dream into learn? Right? Can I move my learn into plan, or do I need more time with that course? Did I plan what I needed to say, or where am I at, and then what's my focus project? This is a couple things. It allows me to stay focused. It's only the 3rd week of the month. I still have another week to go. So now I'm focused. Now I'm like, oh, cool. I love this.

Cara Harvey [00:29:06]:
This is what I wanna do. So I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to finish these goals because I'm excited. It also allows me to say, hey. This didn't work, so I need a little bit more time, and I can move it and rinse and repeat. When you constantly audit your goals and you're not just saying, I'll look at them at the end of the quarter, I'll look at them at the end of the year, you can move forward. You cannot stay stuck. You can actually make progress on things because you're not stuck in one place. I know we covered a lot today.

Cara Harvey [00:29:37]:
I told you this is gonna be a little fire hose, fast and furious. I'd love to connect with you more, and just help you out with your business, with your personal goals. I am really on a mission to help moms figure out how they can find time for what matters, and this is just one of the ways I teach it. You can join me on my podcast, which is the Purpose Driven Mom Show. I'm over on Instagram at a Purpose Driven Mom. I have a free workbook at the 15minuteformula.com/free. You can also links over to Amazon Barnes and Noble to buy the book. But what I want for you today is I want you to take one action from today.

Cara Harvey [00:30:05]:
K? You decide. Do I wanna make a vision for my goals for next month? Maybe. Do I want to figure out my dream, learn, plan, do in my habits? Do I want to spend some time breaking down my work batches? Right? Or do I wanna figure out my schedule for next week? And then ask yourself, how frequently am I checking in with my goals? How frequently am I making them a reality instead of just this cute thing I put on a vision board? That's what's gonna help you get to success in your business and not stay stuck. I am rooting for you. You've got this. Have a great one.
