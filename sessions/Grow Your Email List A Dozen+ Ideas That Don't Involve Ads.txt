[00:00:14.270] - Liz
What up? What up? That is in sync. This is Mountain Dew. I'm Liz Wilcox.

[00:00:21.110] - Liz
And you are watching the Blogger Breakthrough Summit. I'm so excited that I almost choked. Note. More specifically, you are now watching the presentation call grow your email list. A dozen plus ideas that don't involve ads.

[00:00:36.250] - Liz
I am wicked wicked excited. Tripping up my words. Just so you know, if you're watching this in bed right now, maybe it's early in the morning. You're just trying to you know see what's out there. I want you to know in this presentation, I'm going to hype you up, hype up the energy.

[00:00:56.430] - Liz
I've got sound effects. Yeah. Let's give you a round of applause. Let's give Liz a round of applause for hosting this event. And so I've got sound effects.

[00:01:07.570] - Liz
Anytime you hear this sound, that's when I want you to really pay attention, write something down. I don't want you to have to write a bunch of stuff down, but I do want you to pay attention at certain points. Okay. Today's agenda is, well, number one, why email marketing?

[00:01:25.350] - Liz
Chances are you're watching this? You're probably already semi quasi convinced. I want to give you a quick pep talk. I want to talk about why I'm qualified to talk about this. I promise that will be a short part.

[00:01:37.310] - Liz
And then I'm going to get into the right freebie and how to get people on your list. Sounds good. Sounds good. And let's have some fun. I used to have a lot more sound effects.

[00:01:48.720] - Liz
So, you got lucky today. Let's get into my main objective for you today, though. Okay, so in general, anytime I give a presentation, all I want you to do is take what I've done and pick out what works best for you. That's why this talk is titled you know, A Dozen Plus Ideas. I don't want you to try a dozen plus ideas.

[00:02:08.870] - Liz
I don't want you to have to write everything down or try to do a bunch of stuff at once. I want you to just learn one thing. I want you to get excited about one thing, and then I want you to go do that. One thing. I believe in you.

[00:02:20.950] - Liz
I believe in your creativity. I believe in your ability to do one thing at a time that makes sense for you. You don't need my permission to deviate from this. This is just the push you need to get started.

[00:02:35.230] - Liz
Okay. Sounds good. I've got a picture of Kevin Hart here because I love this story. Kevin Hart, if you read his autobiography, you'll see how he got so big.

[00:02:46.210] - Liz
And that was because of email marketing. Now, how did the comedian use email marketing to become this giant mobile megastar that he is today? Well, I've got the sticky notes here. So, every time he would go to a new show, a new venue. You know there's hundreds, thousands of comedians out there competing for the same venues, the same cities the same audiences, people that go out and listen to comedy at clubs.

[00:03:14.830] - Liz
Right. And so, every time he would go to a new venue, a new show, he had something like this, like a note card. Right. And he would put one at every seat. And he'd say, if you like the show, please fill this out with your name and your email address.

[00:03:29.140] - Liz
Next time I you know come to Destiny. Next time I come to Detroit. Next time I come to Milwaukee, whatever you'll be the first to know. And that's how he was able to impress bookies, impress people's bookies that's like a gambling thing, right?

[00:03:46.170] - Liz
He could impress the venues. He could sell out, and he could get bigger and bigger and all started with email marketing. So, whatever your business is, whatever kind of blog you have, I promise you can make email marketing work for you. Alright, let's get into the pet talk. This is what I want you to write down.

[00:04:02.930] - Liz
List building is essential to my business. Now pause this and write it down because I'm going to keep going. Here's another one. I want you to write down. List building is a money making activity.

[00:04:14.280] - Liz
It might not seem that way, but it totally is. You can make money from your email. Look at that Kevin Hart thing like, holy crap. Who would think a comedian could use email marketing? I promise you, blogging is much more simple.

[00:04:26.380] - Liz
Okay, moving on. The last thing I want you to write down is list building isn't just about getting to the highest number possible. Okay. It's all about finding quality leads, and I am going to show you how to do that. Okay, so I need to remove this.

[00:04:49.950] - Liz
Why am I qualified to talk about this? You can see I was practicing, and not everything is perfect. Do things even when they're not perfect, that's a side note. Okay, so why am I qualified to talk about this?

[00:05:02.820] - Liz
First of all, LizWilcox.com, the Liz Wilcox branding. You see, today, this is actually my third online business. I started out as a blogger, just like you. I started out as an RV travel blogger.

[00:05:15.390] - Liz
My blog was called The Virtual Campground, and I would go to summit like this. I would listen to podcast, go to the Webinars, and everyone and their mother kept telling me that I wish I would have taken my email marketing more seriously. I wish I would have built my list. If I would have built my list and taken it seriously. I would have made so much more money by now.

[00:05:37.020] - Liz
And these were people that were making so much money to me. Right? And so, Mama didn't raise no fool. I'm nothing if not an efficient chick. And so I said, okay, I'm going to build my list.

[00:05:47.680] - Liz
I'm going to make money with email marketing. And I did that with the Virtual campground. And I ended up building such a strong, healthy list. That when I launched my first digital course. I had 141 people on the waitlist, and by the end of Cart close, I had 141 sales.

[00:06:05.820] - Liz
Crazy. I went on to CoCreate a digital summit much like this called full Time Free and week. At the time of this recording, we just put it on the market for sale and we do a lot of sales through email marketing. We build our list throughout the year, not just when we are trying to you know do the summit. And so, I know a lot of list building about that too.

[00:06:28.220] - Liz
And then, of course, with lizwilcox.com, I have built my list up. I think there was a screenshot here. And as you can see and I'll talk more about this later. But slow growth is growth.

[00:06:42.750] - Liz
As you can see, I have been building my list for almost two years now and really nowadays, towards the right hand side, you can see that. Not a day goes by that my email doesn't get new people on the list. So, real quick, I just want to go through a few quick 'do nots'.

[00:07:03.500] - Liz
I do not want you to think that you have to have multiple freebies. I know, as bloggers were often taught content upgrades, you write a blog post, you write a specific freebie for that blog post, right? You don't necessarily have to do that. I don't want you to stress over paid ads, like the title of the talk goes. I'm not going to share any paid ad strategies. Chances are that you work really hard for your money, and maybe you're not ready to give it to Mark Zuckerberg and Facebook and Google just yet.

[00:07:37.730] - Liz
Right. So, I'm going to give you strategies that are tried and true that don't involve you paying money. And I don't want you to give up. This is a long term strategy. Let's go back to this and I'll talk more and more about this.

[00:07:50.780] - Liz
But look at this. This is from, let's see. Let me move in January, 2021 to the time of this recording around mid November. And as you can see, there was a spike there that it was small, small. You can see in these summer months it was like nil, right?

[00:08:05.930] - Liz
Almost nothing. And then now look at it. These last few months, it's been crazy awesome for me. I don't want you to give up. Okay.

[00:08:14.720] - Liz
List building is a long term strategy, but it builds high dividends. Remember, list building as a long term strategy that brings huge dividends. Okay. Instead of all that, I want you to just create one great freebie. Okay?

[00:08:32.600] - Liz
I want you to put it and yourself, you've got to put yourself out there. Look at me right now with this loud colors and sink in the background. Look at my rainbow glasses. Right?

[00:08:41.520] - Liz
I'm really putting myself out there for you. Right? And again, I already mentioned this because it's just so dang important. I want you to recognize that slow growth is still there. It's still growth.

[00:08:54.200] - Liz
Even you know think of the tortoise and the hare, right? We all want to be the hare. We all want to just go, go, go, get it done. Reach 10,000 subscribers, reach our 1st 100. But the reality is we're more like the tortoise in that it's just one step at a time.

[00:09:09.640] - Liz
And then it slowly turns into a snowball and we win in the end. Okay, so how do we do that? Here's the show time. Anybody else a Will Smith fan? I'm a huge Will Smith fan.

[00:09:22.090] - Liz
You can call me the fresh princess of email. Okay, so job number one, create a great freebie. Here's how we're going to do that. Okay, so the offer. Think of your customer journey and work backward.

[00:09:37.040] - Liz
Okay. What's the very last step you want people to take? Now work backwards and think of those first little baby steps you want somebody to take. You can also look at what are people Googling? What are they searching for?

[00:09:48.350] - Liz
You can even go into Facebook groups and see what people are talking about. And then what format is easiest for people to digest? If you are working with single moms trying to meal prep, maybe don't create a five day course. Chances are they need something quick and fast. Right?

[00:10:04.240] - Liz
So, think about what format is easiest for them to digest. On the other hand, if you blog about microbiomes and people that want to learn more about them, a five day course might make more sense because they're spending time doing a lot of research. Right. The landing page I want you to create copy that stands out and copy stands out when it says a lot in as little words as possible. Brevity, write brevity down.

[00:10:29.130] - Liz
Okay. I want you to showcase your offer and your personality. People buy from people they trust. And of course, this is list building. We're not talking about buying just yet, but this is really the first step in your buyer's journey.

[00:10:41.070] - Liz
You've got to showcase not only your offer, not only your freebie, but your personality as well. Look at these slides right now. This is showing off my personality, right? Even though I'm not trying to sell you anything, I want you to talk directly to your ideal person. Don't make generalities talk directly to the person.

[00:10:59.090] - Liz
I'll show you an example in a second. And then when in doubt, I want you to just keep things simple. I always say I'm a two step chick. If it takes three steps, I'm out. Okay, embody that. The placement.

[00:11:10.590] - Liz
Put it on its own landing page. Of course, I'll show you that in a second. Its own landing page is when they either have to sign up or they have to exit out. Okay. Put your freebie on your home page three to five times. You want to collect emails because email marketing is lucrative as heck.

[00:11:26.590] - Liz
Okay, this is just the first step in that. So, make your home page kind of like a sales page for your freebie. Okay, you can put on your about page, your Sidebar inside blog posts, social media bios, basically always be promoting. Okay, now I'm going to share my screen and show you an example.

[00:11:46.880] - Liz
I've got the wrong thing pulled up. Forgive me. This is the landing page. We're showing a little preview right now, I think here's the preview.

[00:11:55.340] - Liz
Okay, so swipe swipe, baby. Right. And sorry, I just got to scroll down. You're a content creator. I am specifically talking to content creators.

[00:12:05.750] - Liz
If this person comes and they are an ecommerce, they know it's not for them, right? You're building your audience, blah, blah, just a little bit of context, and then I show them what is part of the freebie. Let me just move this up, so you can see it. Swipe, swipe, baby. Give me this.

[00:12:24.090] - Liz
Right. So, very, very simple landing page. Now I want to show you where I put it on the site. Let me make this a little bigger for you and so, you can see.

[00:12:35.430] - Liz
Let me move it over. Well, I'm not going to mess with it. So free email swipes. Boom. That's one way you can get my or that's one.

[00:12:44.800] - Liz
Ask. Here's another. Ask that's two right above the fold. Remember, your home page is basically a sales page for your freebie. We keep scrolling, scrolling, scrolling.

[00:12:55.810] - Liz
Sorry, if this is making you nauseous. As you can see, it's basically a sales page for my freebie. Now I finally got into it. Here is what I want you to know about my freebie. You're going to get a welcome sequence. Newsletter examples, 52 subject lines.

[00:13:09.370] - Liz
Remember, I'm thinking about the very first baby steps I want my customer to take if I want my customers to make $100,000 from email marketing, but they haven't even started yet. I want to make sure they've got a dang good welcome sequence. Right. And then as a bonus, you know they also need to know about newsletters and subject lines. So I'm going to give that as a bonus.

[00:13:28.060] - Liz
But basically, I want you to get that welcome sequence done. Boom, that's three places. Right. Let me move this on the way, we're scrolling, scrolling, scrolling down. Oops, you did it again.

[00:13:43.270] - Liz
There's another place to get my freebie. That's four. And then get your swipes. That's five places right there on the darn homepage where I'm asking you. Also, I said you can put it on your about page.

[00:13:56.360] - Liz
This is basically just another small, different way of approaching things where I'm asking you to or I'm leading into the swipe file. Right. So, I've got it. One, two, three places right here for you. Okay.

[00:14:13.510] - Liz
I hope that makes sense. Alright. Job number two, put it and yourself out there in fun ways. I already showed you my website. I think my website is pretty fun.

[00:14:22.980] - Liz
Like I said, basically, a sales page. I'm going to put a triangle noise on that basically a sales page for your freebie if you're doing it right. Especially as bloggers, even if you don't ever want to sell a digital product. But you know, you need more traffic. Then get the people that are coming to your blog on your email list, so you can consistently send them the new content you're creating and get repeat traffic.

[00:14:47.290] - Liz
I always say the best customer is a repeat customer. The best traffic is repeat traffic. Right. So, here's some ideas other than what I just showed you about you know putting it on your home page and stuff like that. So what was I talking about?

[00:15:03.000] - Liz
Put it and yourself out there in fun ways. Alright. So, I've broken it down into three levels. Basically, the left hand here is a start here. This is the bare minimum stuff you need to do. As you pick up speed.

[00:15:18.460] - Liz
The stuff in the middle is going to help you take a screenshot of this. Please steal it. Take a screenshot. I want you to remember this, but I don't want you to try to remember all of it at once. Just pick one thing, remember?

[00:15:29.730] - Liz
And then top shelf stuff is something that takes quite a bit of effort. It might take you a year or two to even get there. Right. But basically start here. Just start asking around.

[00:15:41.410] - Liz
You know, hey, I'm starting this thing about meal planning. Do you need help with meal planning? Want to get on my email list? Here we go. Facebook group interactions, of course.

[00:15:51.030] - Liz
And social media. I put an asterisk here. Don't go. Just spamming Facebook groups, et cetera, et cetera. But strategically make yourself available in those Facebook groups.

[00:16:00.410] - Liz
Become the expert on meal planning, on RV, travel on email marketing on whatever. Right? Make yourself the expert and those opportunities to put your freebie and to share what you do are going to come naturally. Guest blogging is a great thing. You can guest blog.

[00:16:17.600] - Liz
You can write about something like if my email or my freebie is a welcome sequence, I might write five guest blogs for people about why welcome sequences are important. And then, of course, the link is to get my welcome sequence for free. Right? I'm not linking to my site. I'm linking directly to the freebie.

[00:16:36.500] - Liz
I want people to sign up. Of course, Pinterest and optimizing your website, which I already showed you. Okay. Picking up speed, you might get a Facebook group. You can ask an entry question. If you have any questions about that, please email me. I want to keep this short.

[00:16:52.460] - Liz
But basically, if you've got that Facebook group, you can ask like, hey, I had a Facebook group that was RV renovations and I asked people like, hey, I've got 101 ideas for renovating your RV. Do you want to put your email below? And so many people would put their email. I think when I sold that blog, I had about 5000 subscribers. And now that blog has over 20,000 subscribers.

[00:17:20.750] - Liz
These things are things that are evergreen, putting yourself and your freebie out there. It lives out there in the internet forever, and you can keep growing. Remember, this is a long term strategy. Link sharing inside your network, I'll show you an example of that in a second. Podcast and summit like this. Right.

[00:17:36.530] - Liz
Giveaways. I do want to say giveaways can give you a lot of leads, but they might not necessarily be good leads. They might be people that are just trying to get the free thing. Once they don't win, they're out. So, I will caveat that, other visibility strategies, like radio, TV, other media guest blogging for Huffington Post, getting interviewed by Amazon.

[00:18:00.580] - Liz
Or I'm sorry, like you know the local news station etcetera, and then grow your affiliates. Right now, I have almost 200 affiliates that literally share my products. And so, what that does is it gets people on my list that are already customers, which is again, that's pretty fun. Right. And then top shelf, like Liz is doing, you can host your own virtual summit or virtual event.

[00:18:25.660] - Liz
You can do JV webinars. Let's say you know my audience makes sense for your meal planning. We're going to get together. We're going to host a webinar and you're going to get those emails that people signed up through me. Right.

[00:18:38.800] - Liz
Other affiliate stuff I just mentioned ,speaking events, and again, this is top shelf, right. You really got to have a message and you have to master it in order to speak. But it's definitely going to get you the best leads ever.

[00:18:52.140] - Liz
If you saw me speaking in real life and you got pumped up when you want to work with me. Yes. And then, of course, just going to events. Just being an attendee that can help you find the right leads as well. Alright, let's go to an example.

[00:19:06.190] - Liz
We're still on this about page. I said I would show you an example of link sharing. Let me get myself out of the way here first. Sorry, folks. I'm going to make myself smaller. Okie, dokie.

[00:19:20.410] - Liz
I think you can still hear me. It says the mic is muted, but then it says the mic is working. So, as you can see here, this is a subject I've taken the day off. Meet Miles. Now Miles is somebody who doesn't do the exact same thing as me, but it makes sense to have him in the ecosystem. So, he's created a special presentation.

[00:19:42.450] - Liz
I'm going to click on it. And if you can't tell from the background, I love in sync. So, what he's done here is how to build a funnel that's in sync with your heart and then you know get on my email list if that makes sense. Now, I did the same thing for Miles. As you can see, his thing is heart funnels.

[00:20:02.240] - Liz
Here's. Liz Wilcox, I made a special gif. Click me. And as you can see here, my call to action is click here to get heart centered email swipes for free, right. So, they click that and then they go directly to this page. Right.

[00:20:19.650] - Liz
And as you can see from what I shared with you earlier, this mega swipe file, I have changed it to say your heart centered, but you also need money. That's where emails come in. Right. So, I just changed it a little bit. It does not take that much effort.

[00:20:36.710] - Liz
Okay. Where am I? Okay. Done with those examples? So basically, what I want you to know is with list building and all of that with the right freebie in the right places you can go from. This is your ideal person saying, like, oh, my gosh, I don't know her right to holy crap, we belong together, right?

[00:21:02.090] - Liz
With the right freebie and the right offer. That is exactly what is going to happen for you. Because list building and visibility go hand in hand. Okay. You can see me in the background here. Hey, list building and visibility go hand in hand.

[00:21:18.450] - Liz
I want you to write that down. List building and visibility go hand in hand. The more you put yourself out there, the more you put your freebie out there, the more you're going to build your list and the more visible you're going to be. Right. So, I want you to, this is job three.

[00:21:36.820] - Liz
And I've mentioned this. It should be job number one, because it's so important. I need to redo this. Recognize that slow growth is still growth, right. I showed you that graphic with my list where it's, like, really, really, slow.

[00:21:51.770] - Liz
Then it's kind of a crazy spike, really, really, slow. Then in the summer, it gets even slower. And then since September, it's just kind of blown up, right. I can't imagine what it's going to look like a year from now, but that's because all of these ideas here are evergreen, right? They are not just ads where it's going to be like, okay, they're running the ads and then the ads get leads.

[00:22:17.270] - Liz
If I turn off the ads, the leads stop coming. All of this stuff, especially podcast summits, other visibility strategies. Those are evergreen, and it's only going to build your list more and more and more and more. Okay. So, remember, slow growth is still growth.

[00:22:33.810] - Liz
Now, here's the one thing I really really want you to learn, and I really want you to take away from this. Write this down Where's my triangle? I will be me and I will have fun. Right. The more authentic you can be. And the more fun.

[00:22:52.490] - Liz
Well, number one, the more authentic you can be, the more you are. I'm very like Wilcox, you can tell that, right. So, the more you can be you, the more it's going to attract the right person. The more you're going to create a freebie that makes sense for you and your audience. And then on the other side, the more you have fun, the more you're going to want to put stuff out there. Right.

[00:23:11.860] - Liz
I love doing presentations like this. Some people don't like to do summit, so don't pick that. If you don't like to do presentations, if you don't like to be on video, pick another visibility. Another list building strategy. Like I said at the beginning, like take what I've given you and just take the one thing that makes sense.

[00:23:28.230] - Liz
Take the one thing that makes the most sense. And you have the most fun with, that's going to make it fun to get out there. That's going to change it from like, oh, no, I have to list that I have to do this. It's a long term strategy. I might not see it for a while, too.

[00:23:40.650] - Liz
Oh, my gosh. This is fun. List building is essential. It's money making, and it's not about getting the highest numbers, about getting that quality. All those things I said at the beginning. If you do this, if you promise yourself, you don't have to promise me.

[00:23:54.320] - Liz
I'd love for you to promise yourself, I will be me and have fun. Then it's going to make all of this, like, truly amazing. It's like I said. Here's the thing, freebies are a dime a dozen. We all know that we've all signed up for a million freebies that we never downloaded.

[00:24:10.780] - Liz
Right? Raise your hand if, right, I feel kind of like a clown. Sometimes every time I sign up for a freebie and don't use it, right? Raise your hand. Just like I said in that last slide.

[00:24:23.030] - Liz
Authenticity being yourself, it attracts and it gains trust. And remember, I said something earlier, people buy from people they trust. So, if you can be authentic, if you can have fun, that's going to gain trust, like, it's going to go zero to 100 real quick. You're going to be like, Drake. Okay.

[00:24:39.130] - Liz
And oh, that's my circle. People buy from people they trust. Now here's my thing. This is a slide full of customers of mine. I know every one of this person.

[00:24:49.970] - Liz
That's a picture of me and Heather with my kid and her kid in San Diego. This is a picture of me and Diana walking to get chips and soda in Philadelphia. Here's a picture of me, RV, and Jessie, and my kid. We met up in Tampa. Of course, I was a travel blogger, so it was very easy for me to meet up with people.

[00:25:07.810] - Liz
I think every one of these pictures is in a different state. But my point is when you list, though, when you create that freebie, when you put yourself and it out there, think of these leads as real people that is going to make it so much easier to do all these things to create the right offer. It's not a chore. It's not just something you have to do to build your list and build your business. This is something that helps you truly connect.

[00:25:37.050] - Liz
And I know as a blogger and I know as being in Liz's world that you are real. You are authentic. And you don't want to just sell stuff, you want to serve people. And so, as you go through, as you pick out what kind of freebie you want to do and where you want to put it, think of all these new leads that you're going to get as real people. And that is going to make email marketing so much more fun. And it's going to help you become so much more authentic because you'll know that you are creating something for the right people.
