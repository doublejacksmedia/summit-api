All right guys. I'm super excited to learn from this next speaker. Dan is the owner of DJR Designs, who is a strategic graphic designer who impacts coaches, speakers, and course creators with the ability to transform existing designs into compelling visuals. He helps make these designs resonate, engage, and start conversions with their target audience. Dan, a big warm welcome. Thank you so much for being here.

[00:00:34.000] - Dan Rondeau
Thank you very much, Liz, for having me here. I'm really excited to really do this. And I will let you know that you really are the first Summit that I've really gotten into to do this. I speak quite a bit in networking groups and everything like that, but to be like platform Summit and everything too, I was like, 'Oh', I'm like, 'Yay'. So, I'm super excited that you have the first ability to have me here in front of your audience.

[00:01:00.840] - Liz
Yeah, no, excited. I'm going to let you take it away.

[00:01:03.620] - Dan
All right. I'm going to put my slideshow up over here, and I'm going to pop this into here. I just need the good word that you can see everything good.

[00:01:16.740] - Liz
Yeah, I think that I'm good.

[00:01:18.660] - Dan
Beautiful. All right. So, again, thank you so much. What I really wanted to come to the table with, when it comes around to designs and everything, is that you really do have a great amount of visuals that you can use in your business and really leverage how much power you have when people are looking at your designs. Hence why I went with this title. It really shows when you're thinking about the impact that you're making, whether it's for your business, if you're doing it for somebody else, or you're doing it for a marketing piece. It really just ties all back in together to strategically look at how you want people to see what you're doing in that. So, just to give a little quick on me. I'll just give you the rundown on this, too. So, I've worked in the pharmaceutical space for over 13 years, and it really was a change for me when I wanted to get out of that space. I really didn't want to stay there. It's not my thing at all whatsoever. I really just wanted to focus more on helping people because that's why I went into healthcare originally. But then, in turn, it really transitioned into 'I don't want to be there anymore'.

[00:02:31.630] - Dan
So, I left there in August of 2020. I was already a little bit into my business by then because I had worked in this for over seven years, but knew that wasn't my space. This was the space that I was really going to help more people in, and focusing heavily on that strategic side of the designs with all of the marketing collateral that goes with it. It really makes such a difference when you think strategically through everything. And then, of course, there's my wife and my daughter. I've been married to my wife for 11 years now, and my daughter was just born in June. She was six and a half weeks early. We had a very long 2023 when it came to that. But she really is the why of why I do this. Without her, my wife, and a few other very important people in there that are supporting me along the way, this whole thing wouldn't have been a reality when it comes to this. I've been blessed to have them here. Every day that I get up and I'm here, I'm taking care of my daughter, and she's the reason why I do this every day, and I love it for that reason.

[00:03:44.760] - Dan
All right. So, pieces of why I'm coming today. We're going to talk about captivating your audience, really knowing why the visuals are there to make that impact, then the consistency that comes with them, and why it's important to keep that consistency throughout everything. Then a little bit of food for thought when it comes to that. All right. I'm doing everything on my other screen so I can just solely focus straight on you so you don't have to look at anything. All right. So, captivating your audience. So, why are the images that we are using very important for this? One, you want to make sure that what we're doing and putting out there is going to make that influence. So, it does influence the decisions that your audience is going to make and take action. So, whether that action is they're going to click on the link in your bio or in the blog itself to keep reading. If your marketing piece is out there, are they going to click on it to make a sale? When you have that captivating image that's going to drive them to want to do something, then of course, they're going to want to do it.

[00:04:53.340] - Dan
And you don't want to have them sitting there pondering their thoughts behind this because again, they're just going to sit there and then might not take an action. So, we want to make sure that we take that action in that. It also creates a very strong emotional side to things because we all play on emotions. And depending upon where your target audience is, who you're targeting, you really want to think about what emotions that they're going to be feeling coming into this. When I'm using it for marketing pieces, and we're looking at how we want to bring that audience right in, we want to make sure that we're tugging at the heartstrings of those that need it, or we're actually going to have something that's going to be like, 'Yes, I just want to click on it right now. Just take my money. Take my money and go there.' And sometimes it's got to be right in that middle piece where it's like, 'Yes, I understand where you're coming from that. I need to learn a little bit more about you. So, let me click on your bio, or let me click and find out how much more we're actually going to be doing into this.'

[00:05:55.200] - Dan
And then it also really develops that strong recognition for your brand. Brand recognition is very heavy, depending upon whether it's your business, your client's business, or wherever it is. You want to make sure that they know that it's driving to them. So, whether that's using pieces of your colors, your fonts, everything that you have, it's going to play a little bit of an influence in that. And you want to make sure that they're recognizing, hey, that's you. As you can see, I have a lot of the diamonds in mine. It's also in my logo and everything. That keeps that brand recognition there. So, if somebody happens to see that gradient pattern that I have in that, they'll automatically know that it's me after a certain amount of time, which I'll get into afterward. But it keeps that recognition there. The imagery that I use in all of my business, it's very strategically aligned to make sure that what I'm talking about is actually going to resonate with them and make them want to learn more about me, or whatever it is that we're talking about. And cluttered images convey less. A lot of people think that you can take an image and try and throw everything that you need to learn on it, and then people are going to be great.

[00:07:07.070] - Dan
They'll pick the pieces that they need out of it. I look at a very cluttered image, and I'm like, 'Nope, I just got to keep moving on that,' because I'm like, 'That's too much for me to stop and take a quick look at.' So, less is always more. If you're conveying everything that you want it to convey on the image, then you're great. If you're conveying less on the image and it's actually driving the message even more forward, then you're great. You don't have anything to worry about because it's getting across to your ideal audience exactly the way that you want it to. If they have to stop and think about things a little bit more and be like, 'Okay, I have to stop. I have to really read this.' I'm like, 'Okay, I'm moving my eyes all around it.' Yeah, you're great because you're thinking, 'Hey, they're going to stay a little bit longer to read this.' They may not pick up on all of these things or not make the decision to want to click on them. And then infographics, something that I have seen very limited amounts of that have been going on throughout business.

[00:08:06.660] - Dan
I used to do social media as part of my business when I first started this, and infographics were very heavy, let's say, seven years ago, because it's been about that long since I started doing this. Everybody was doing infographics. You'd see them everywhere. Over the course of the time that social media has progressed, I've seen quite a bit less use on them. If they are done properly, you can convey a lot of information in a very small amount of infographic. Plus, it allows them to keep scrolling down on them. They'll be able to read them a little bit more, and see all the info. And if they're picking up on the pieces they want, they'll click on them and then it'll learn more from there. And my takeaway on this as well, too, for you is that you really do have eight seconds. And I'm going to say even eight seconds or less in most cases, depending upon the platforms that you're using, to help make that impression on your ideal audience and get them to either stop the scroll or else they're going to just keep scrolling along. And the goal in this is that you want to keep their attention long enough so that way they make this decision to either look at your info, look more about you, or read what you want.

[00:09:17.410] - Dan
Otherwise, if it's not hitting them, they're just going to keep scrolling. And in the TikTok world that we live in and Instagram scrolling, that's what happens quite a bit. I look at my own thought process and how I do things as well on my own social media, and I am that person as well too that if it doesn't resonate with me, I'm automatically moving on from it. All right. So, visual consistency across the platforms. Cohesiveness is something I preach a lot about because I'm very big about knowing that when you're looking across all areas, whether it's just the blog, just the website, just all these things, you want to make sure that each piece of these things is consistent across. You don't want to have somebody going to your website, then going to your social media, and it's a completely different look, and feel. They're going to start questioning whether or not they're using this platform correctly. Are they still active? Is the business even still open? You want to make sure everything stays the same across and by the same, I mean the same elements. It doesn't have to be the same exact image going across everything.

[00:10:29.690] - Dan
If you're using diamonds like I'm doing in the PowerPoint, you want to make sure that you're at least using that strategically throughout all of the platforms - all the same colors, all the same fonts, everything that matches - so it makes this nice little [inaudible 00:10:44] package that they keep coming back to at all times. So, static social media images, if you're using them on Instagram, if you're using them on Facebook or wherever, keep the same flow going through everything - brand colors, brand fonts, and everything. And then also to note that you don't necessarily have to use different images throughout all of the social media. You can still use the same ones which used to be a no-no. Beforehand you'd want to change things up. But still, I have never seen anybody recently go through where they have to recreate the same image four different times. They really just want to make sure that if you're using it, it's another piece of that brand recognition and everything strategically stays there. Stories and Reels - Your stories mimic a lot of the static posts, and they can just vary briefly just to make sure that it all fits cohesively on there.

[00:11:37.590] - Dan
Reels tie into the next one, which is the video cover images. If you're posting a reel on Instagram, create a cover that can go with that. For the people that like to have the cohesive grid, which works for certain brands and for certain businesses, and it doesn't for others, it keeps that flow there. Plus, it's another piece that they'll be able to click on, remember that it's you, and then keep going from that. Thumbnails - Whether that's a YouTube thumbnail or your actual blog thumbnail that you use on your website, keep it all within the same brand - everything that matches. Plus, on top of that, you can also use that same thumbnail variation that you have on there. You can use those same elements throughout the rest of these pieces. Headers and Banners - I'm going to come back after for more on the headers piece because I have a very big piece on the headers and the banners. But those are key elements that you can be using to drive people to your website, to drive people to the blog, to drive people to wherever that you need them to. So, utilizing them more than just, 'I'm going to just throw something up there to have it because I don't want to have on LinkedIn the little blue background that's at the top.' Or on Facebook, 'I don't want to have something blank on there.'

[00:12:57.850] - Dan
You can constantly keep using these and updating them to reflect your brand and actually get more traffic to be driven out there. I'll go into more of that after. And then Pinterest pins - I don't personally use Pinterest enough. I really do think that it drives, depending upon the business that you have and exactly who your target audience is. So, certain businesses will have a much better reach on Pinterest. However, if people are looking for certain things, those pins will be another piece of that brand recognition that you have created and you'll be able to use it, and leverage it more for search purposes. Because I do come across a lot of things when I'm searching on Google or YouTube, and it ties back to a pin somehow. So, it just creates another little notch that ties into the next piece, which is that you need a minimum of 20 touchpoints for that brand recognition. And it doesn't necessarily have to be going to the website alone or going to one social media post. That's just one piece to them. So, if they're bouncing between their website, your social media, Pinterest, and YouTube, that's all a touchpoint.

[00:14:17.130] - Dan
And if they're seeing the same elements of your brand, and the same themes and values that you're bringing to that brand, it's all going to tie back together into that 20 touchpoints. Once they hit that 20 touchpoints, they're probably going to be like, 'Wow, I keep seeing this person all along. Maybe I need to go follow them.' Or, 'Maybe I need to DM them.' Or, 'Maybe I need to reach out and see, are there services, something that I need to utilize more.' And then some design food for thoughts. Just some things that I didn't know that would have a big impact on this presentation as far as where I could put them that would make it really fit. I wanted to just throw some thoughts out there for everybody to use. Done is always better than perfect. That has been preached to me so many times, and I'm still one as a designer that I have to have everything perfect in this. And it sometimes bothers me to the point that I have to stop and walk away, and remember that as long as I'm getting the feelings and emotions that I want out there, or my audience wants out there, or my clients want out there, what I have is going to work.

[00:15:34.740] - Dan
So, if you're thinking strategically about how your design is going to influence that audience and you're feeling that and you're comfortable with putting that out there, done is better than perfect. It does not have to be absolutely the best because you will grow each single time that you keep doing this, and you will get to the point where you're going to be like, 'Boom, boom, boom, done. I'm good. I don't have to deal with anything else on that.' All right, back to the banners, which is what I talked about. Banners do act as a billboard for your business. Think that every single time that somebody visits your LinkedIn profile, your Facebook profile, your Facebook Business page, looking at an email, there are banners on each one of those. If you are not using those to leverage traffic to your website, traffic to your blog, if you have a product or service that you're offering - and Liz, I'm going to throw you into this as well, too, because I saw your LinkedIn because I looked at that right away to make sure that I could tie back into this. It does talk about this, the Summit that you have in here.

[00:16:39.350] - Dan
So, again, it's driving the traffic back to your Summit, and it's driving back to whatever piece of the business that you're promoting at the time.

[00:16:49.310] - Liz
Did you say you looked at my LinkedIn? I have no clue what's on there.

[00:16:52.990] - Dan
There was something about the Summit on there. [crosstalk 00:16:55].

[00:16:56.810] - Dan
Now, I'm going to tell you whether or not it was the Summit you did last time or this one, it doesn't matter because I did look at it because that was the one thing. I was going to try and grab some examples somewhere on this. [crosstalk 00:17:07] 

[00:17:09.230] - Liz
I'm never on LinkedIn. I have no clue

[00:17:10.340] - Dan
Well, you have something on there. So, I'm going to tell you right now that it was another reminder that, 'Oh, good, so she is promoting the Summit that's going on, on there.' And I know that some people don't update those. And I've seen some that are still talking about what when they were in their corporate environment before and now they own a business. Or there was something that they did 10 years ago that they don't even offer anymore, because they're not thinking about updating that. It's good to update those banners more than once, more than just when you have a brand overhaul. Why not update them consistently? Because if you're having new individuals coming to whatever social media or your email specifically, because you send those out every day, you have that promotion right there for you. So, utilize it, and update them. And a little tip that's not on there is that A/B testing on banners is always fun. I do this a lot with my clients. We'll take their Facebook Business page, and if they have a Facebook group, we will create the same image, pop one on one, and then use the same elements, but just tie it a little bit differently in another and see which one gets traffic. Because you might have different audiences being driven to each one of their different pieces of that, whether it's the group or the Facebook page.

[00:18:36.460] - Dan
On LinkedIn, we just constantly have always been updating my clients depending upon what they're doing, whether it's summits, or they have a new product that's coming out. If they write a blog every month or week, then we might want to pop that up there and be like, 'Hey, check out the blog.' And if it's something they want to consistently keep promoting, keep it up there for as long as you need to. Templates are great tools. And I'm going to stress that because templates are that, they are templates to help you get to where you need to go. When you need something quick, and I call them down and dirty at this point, you need a down and dirty graphic that just needs to be done, go for the template. But also be mindful that, especially around Canva, templates are very overused. And as you start noticing other people's graphics that are going out there, you'll start noticing the templates that are out there because they use the same templates. It's always the first five or eight that are up there that they just keep grabbing because, 'Hey, it's good. I can just use this.' If you want to stand out a little bit more than just having the graphic be done, take a couple of different templates that you see on there, plop them all into three different panels on Canva, take the fourth panel and start playing around with it.

[00:19:50.410] - Dan
Don't overdo it. Just go with the flow. So, if it takes you half an hour to do it, great. But if you're down in there and you're talking seven, eight hours into it, pause, go back, look at the template, and then just go with the one that's going to work at that because it's not about prolonging the process. It's really about simplifying it and making you stand out more. DIY versus professional. This one I get asked a lot - when is it time to start thinking about this? And at the beginning stages, go with the DIY because you want to utilize the time that you have and, of course, the resources to just keep going with that. As you're building this brand and as you're building this business up to a point where you're either not getting the ideal audience into your network, you're not having these conversations, or what you're putting out there is really not resonating with you anymore, and you're like, 'I don't want to do this anymore,' that's the time to think about, 'Okay, maybe I do need to bring somebody in to start helping me build this.'

[00:20:57.100] - Dan
That may be a VA that just knows how to do basic design work, but be mindful about the fact that you want to make sure that they understand your brand, your visions, who your ideal audience is, and be able to help transition those conversions to you. If you're still not getting any of that, then it's time to go to somebody who solely does this, and understands your market as well, too. And as long as they are willing to, I use the term co-create with you, that's the piece. This is not a one-way street where I just tell you what to do. You have visions, you have goals, and it's your business. If I create something and you're not willing to put it out there for any reason, that doesn't work because now you're spending money and not using anything and having to go back. This is a co-creation process. We take everything together and make it work to exactly what you want as a business. And then your ideal audience and your brand is always at the focus. Always, always, always think about them before you create any design piece that's in there because you want to make sure that who you are targeting is actually going to be the one that's coming into your world, and also that you're not driving them to your competitors instead.

[00:22:18.150] - Dan
Because I've come across that quite a bit as well, too. People think that they're doing a great job and then realizing that, 'Yeah, what I'm doing or the imagery that I'm putting out there, it works for me because I like it.' But if your ideal audience doesn't like it, then it's not really working.

[00:22:34.370] - Liz
I like that.

[00:22:36.370] - Dan
Thank you. And then 92 % of purchasing decisions are influenced by the designs as well, too. So, think about that when it comes to the actual products that you have out there. Just keep in mind that you want to make sure that you're putting out those quality things that are doing and bringing in that audience to make that decision to act and say, 'Yes, I want to work with you.' Or, 'Yes, I want your product.' Or, 'Yes, I want to read more and make that work.'

[00:23:07.020] - Liz
All right. I have a lot to do now. I have a lot of banners [crosstalk 00:23:12] that need fixing.

[00:23:13.550] - Dan
I didn't think that I was going to make you have a laundry list out of this.

[00:23:18.300] - Liz
It's okay. It's okay. It happens every year. I'm like, 'Oh, I got to do that, too.' How do you feel about doing a little critique? I opened up my Canva, I opened up some older designs. You want to do a little critique? Because I always love a good [crosstalk 00:23:32] real-world example.

[00:23:34.900] - Dan
You're going to let me play strategy session? Oh, my. Oh, yes.

[00:23:39.130] - Liz
And I promise my feelings will not be hurt by whatever you say.

[00:23:44.190] - Dan
And as I say to every one of my audience as well too, is that I'm here to provide any info that I can for you. Whether you want to take the info and do something with it, that's not up to me. That's up to you. I'm here just to help, and however I can help in whatever way. And if it resonates with you, take it. If it doesn't, send it packing.

[00:24:11.100] - Liz
Sure. So, based on what you're saying, I feel like this is a tad cluttered.

[00:24:16.110] - Dan
It is a tad cluttered for me. Plus, the other thing that I would also like to know is how far back was this? And this might also tie back to our discussion on the LinkedIn imagery because I feel like this might be slightly different than what your brand is currently. And tell me if I'm wrong.

[00:24:38.860] - Liz
I mean, you're not wrong. It is one of my brand colors.

[00:24:42.490] - Dan
Okay. It's the feeling that I'm getting off of it, though, I think.

[00:24:46.810] - Liz
Okay, [crosstalk 00:24:47] so this is like a thumbnail for a course in ThriveCart. So, yeah.

[00:24:52.620] - Dan
Now I'd want to know what the actual ThriveCart looks like. Because if you notice when I do this, it's because my brain's starting to move. Okay. [crosstalk 00:25:01] 

[00:25:02.040] - Liz
I don't know. We can go look now.

[00:25:05.020] - Dan
I need to see what it looks like in the ThriveCart, because that's also going to be another piece on this as well, too. And if that little tiny Thumbnail...

[00:25:12.770] - Liz
It looks like that.

[00:25:14.800] - Dan
Okay. So, when I look at this on that, I need a little bit bigger on the... No, not you having to do that. I'm talking actually the image itself, because if I'm looking at that quickly, the words in white are all jumbled to me. [crosstalk 00:25:35] I don't know outside of looking at what it is on there. But if someone's coming quick on that, let's look at the affiliate disclosures made easy down there, that's really readily... I can do that so quickly that I know exactly what I'm looking at.

[00:25:51.740] - Liz
Okay. [crosstalk 00:25:53] The yellow is too hard. Got it.

[00:25:54.760] - Dan
It's not even just that it's too hard. I think the white on the yellow is [inaudible 00:25:57] 

[00:25:57.990] - Liz
Oh, yeah. There's not enough contrast.

[00:26:01.240] - Dan
Correct. You're a confident contributor there. Whatever is underneath all of that, I have no idea what that says.

[00:26:08.630] - Liz
No, [crosstalk 00:26:09] it does show up a bit bigger for students when they're actually in the dashboard.

[00:26:14.110] - Dan
Okay. So, then that makes a difference. [crosstalk 00:26:16]. That makes the difference on that. 

[00:26:21.080] - Liz
Okay, so good. I actually also pulled up an old infographic I made back in the day. Because you talked about infographics. It's a lot. I have some other ones that probably aren't very good either.

[00:26:36.190] - Dan
A lot, because I'm looking at this and I'm like, 'Oh, my, there's a lot that goes into this.' I think if you had... I'm not trying to formulate this the way that I want to.

[00:26:47.680] - Liz
 How could this be at all recovered?

[00:26:50.850] - Dan
No, it can be recovered into this. There are pieces that can be done to this. Obviously, limiting down the...

[00:26:59.020] - Liz
The amount of text.

[00:27:00.380] - Dan
The amount of text into this. So, pieces of this could go [crosstalk 00:27:01] 

[00:27:02.530] - Liz
 I told you I pulled up bad ones, right?

[00:27:06.290] - Dan
Well, you did this on purpose.

[00:27:08.180] - Liz
I did.

[00:27:10.120] - Dan
A lot of these things could also be placed into... I'm going to put this in blog category in this. So, let's think of this as you're adding this to a blog as well, too. The information that's on here, all of this not having the affiliate things like that, that can be added into the blog to tie back into this as well, too. Because if you're putting the title on that completely great at the top. I might...[crosstalk 00:27:35] 

[00:27:35.900] - Liz
Then get rid of that.

[00:27:37.140] - Dan
I might formulate the words a little bit more just to make it fit a little bit tighter into that. And from my thought process, because this is how I think, I say you have your dues at the top, or on one side you do a full green [crosstalk 00:27:55] for dues. And I'm big about also using some actual, I'm going to say 'Do' in this case.

[00:28:05.030] - Liz
Like an icon?

Icon that goes with it. Let's put a checkmark in that. So, if you have 'Do' at the top it could be in that nice light green that's right there. And then you have the 'Do' and you're good. And then the first thing is checkmark. Place your affiliate links there. Checkmark. Next one down. Checkmark. Then 'Don't' nice and bold and nice X icon on each one of those to bullet it down. [crosstalk 00:28:34]. tighter you don't always have to go into full detail because in this case, that 'Don't', the middle one, those are the ones that are standing out because there's enough information in there to get that information out. So, place your disclosure statement. That's perfect. You don't place it in the sidebar. Now I'm trying to think of how can we condense down that chunk of information into maybe 2 to3 lines to match up with everything. Because some people may skip over that because they're like, 'That's a lot of text to read.' Because TLDR in this world that we live in.

[00:29:09.890] - Liz
Yeah. Well, and this is several years old, at least, just for work.

[00:29:15.120] - Dan
Yeah. But again, you just grabbed something quickly.

[00:29:17.850] - Liz
Yeah, I was like, I know I've made some, but yeah. Okay. 

[00:29:21.080] - Dan
All right, so scroll back down to the bottom there. Okay, so...

[00:29:30.590] - Liz
I love that.

[00:29:33.170] - Dan
No, because I'm thinking of how I can make this piece of that, grab that free affiliate disclosure swipe copy [crosstalk 00:29:39] into something else.

[00:29:40.730] - Liz
I don't know that I even do that anymore. I don't think I do.

[00:29:43.070] - Dan
No, but you had it at the time. So, I'm thinking that could also tie back into a button even on this as well, too. That it could be, 'Grab your free affiliate disclosure swipe copy,' and then in that button, it's like, 'Yes, I want this' kind of thing. It doesn't necessarily mean that they're going to click [crosstalk 00:30:04]

[00:30:04.510] - Liz
Yeah, but just the graphic of it, people think of clicking.

[00:30:08.280] - Dan
Correct. Because they're going to want to click on that. And then if it's hyperlinked back to it, beautiful, then you have something there. If not, then you could always add in the text in there, some sort of emoji that goes into the finger that points to here or something to tie that back. And then I would also... A little smaller on your elizabethstapleton.com, and it's centered perfectly and that has no problem there. I think I just might make it a little bit smaller. I mean, if you're promoting this out even further than yeah, you want them to see that, but if this is going inside the blog, you're already on your website as well.

[00:30:50.000] - Liz
I'm pretty sure this is floating around Pinterest somewhere.

[00:30:54.460] - Dan
I could see that as well, too. I can see that very much as well, too. 

[00:30:59.580] - Liz
Yeah. Okay. No, that's great. We could go on and on, but we need to wrap this up.

[00:31:04.000] - Dan
Yes, I know because I don't want to hold [inaudible 00:31:05] [crosstalk 00:31:07] 

[00:31:05.640] - Liz
I know you've got something for everyone. Why don't you share that and tell us about it?

[00:31:11.650] - Dan
Sure. So, going back to the piece on the brand as well and to make it work very well for everybody. There's going to be a Canva template that will be provided that walks through the brand. It gives you your brand colors. You have a place to put all your logos, your typography, and everything that's on there. I didn't also realize that I was that dark when it got dark over here [inaudible 00:31:34], but it adds a little bit of the glow into this without me trying to do that. But the brand sheet will add a lot more layers than just what Canva provides on top of that, because you'll have these spots to put all of these things. And for those that aren't going to be in your Canva, you'll be able to download this as a PDF and be able to just spread this out. Because if you have someone working on your website, your copy, all these other things, they're not necessarily going to be in Canva. You want them to know exactly what it is about your brand that's going to make their life easier going forward, because they'll be able to look at this and be like, 'Okay, now I know I'm going to resonate with this as well.'

[00:32:15.680] - Dan
And then I'll also add on those pieces, so this way you'll know what your mission is, the values that you have, who you're targeting, and just have these little spots to add all of these demographics to add a little more emphasis, which a lot of these brand boards don't have that piece. I really do think that's something that everybody should have. You should be able to have a section that you can just drop these all in there.

[00:32:37.370] - Liz
That's fantastic. Definitely go grab that, guys. I think you have something in the Speaker Bonus Bundle as well, correct?

[00:32:43.460] - Dan
Yes. Now that is going to be more like the big set of the concepts. I'll add another worksheet in there, which will be just a downloadable PDF that does the same flow into that, but it's going to add a lot more of the questions that I would ask when it comes to doing branding itself, because it's wonderful to know all of these things. And if they're just sitting in a tab on your notes or somewhere outside of a Google Doc that you can share and they're just chilling there, no one's going to know about them. So, let's really heavily focus on that piece to know all about your brand, where you're going to go with it, and how it wants to be shown to the audience. Then it's all going to be in this nice little document that you'll have ready to go. You can download the Canva piece, you have this, and then you just tie them together and mirror it all up, and then you have concepts sitting there ready for you to go.

[00:33:36.900] - Liz
Fantastic. So, if you guys haven't upgraded to get the Speaker Bonus Bundle, definitely do that. Dan, thank you so much. I learned a ton. I'm sure everyone watching this did, too.

[00:33:44.930] - Dan
Thank you so much, Liz, again. And it was so wonderful to be here, and I hope to talk to you soon.
