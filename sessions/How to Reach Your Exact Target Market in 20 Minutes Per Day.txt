Hey, this is Dan Morris. I am the head of audience industry, which runs Tracing the Path podcast, findingjoy.net, which is a blog that my wife Rachel runs, and the Orange Circle, which is an elite mastermind. Today I wanted to talk to you about what I do for my 20 minutes in the morning when I drink my hot chocolate. Most people drink coffee, but I'm more of a hot chocolate, and it's probably the most efficient use of time that I use all day. And it has produced the greatest amount of traffic and exposure to my podcast and blogs more than pretty much anything I do other than SEO.

[00:01:00.640] - Dan
So, I thought that I would break down what we do. If you're looking to make the most of your 20 minutes every morning when you sit down and have your coffee or hot chocolate, this is about the best activity I can think of for you to do. So, the most important part about this plan is that I figured out, I don't know when I figured this out, but I did figure out that there are people in this world who need to share your content. Like they need to, not that they want to, or that it would be nice if they did, but they actually need to.

[00:01:41.100] - Dan
And I did that, I realized that when I had a client who had a newsletter. It was actually a dentist office, and they had a newsletter, and they asked that our social media team makes sure that every week they send out a newsletter and have dentist relevant stuff in it, dental, you know, news, technology, whatever. Which meant that we had to go scour the Internet for interesting things about industry, which meant we needed to share someone's content. Does that make sense?

[00:02:16.000] - Dan
Like, that was our job. We needed to find the content and we had to share it. And in this particular case, they had 7500 people on their email list. So, we would be sharing, like, for instance, your content with 7500 people. But I will tell you that that was just the beginning, because in the end, some people that have shared our content have a million people on the list.

[00:02:43.990] - Dan
So, finding the people who have a best interest in your content is the first part. Now, you already know from SEO that if people are searching for a specific topic and they on Google, because this is what you do as well, right? You Google something and then you go to the web page that Google takes you to. So, if people are searching for something and then they go to your page, they have a vested interest in that topic because that's what they're looking for. They either want a solution or funny or entertainment, or they're trying to figure something out, but whatever it is, they search for it and then they find it.

[00:03:18.700] - Dan
Well, other people talk about your topic on the Internet. They talk about it on Reddit. They talk about it on Twitter. They talk about it on blogs. They talk about it wherever it can be talked about.

[00:03:32.970] - Dan
They're interested in it. They're looking for it. An example might be a runner, somebody who is a casual runner. They might run every day, and on Twitter, they might talk about their runs. Ran 6 miles today.

[00:03:47.360] - Dan
You know, gearing up for a race next month, doing a 10K in two months. Just started a marathon program. You know, they're talking about running. Why is that? Because they're runners.

[00:03:58.330] - Dan
They're interested in running. So, what if you had a running blog? Wouldn't it be useful to be in front of people who are talking about running all the time? Not just when they're searching, but also when they're looking to talk about, looking to tweet about it, want to discuss something, want to get a reply. They want somebody to ask a question like, what if you could find those people?

[00:04:23.060] - Dan
So, I use a software product called Talk Walker. Now, there's another one that you're probably more familiar with, and that's called Google Alerts. But Google Alerts is not a supported program anymore, so I'm assuming that someday will just die, and I don't really want all my stuff to someday disappear. So, I moved over to Talk Walker, which is a supported service, and it's free. And so, what I want you to do is I want you to figure out and in the beginning, it will be a little bit nebulous, but I want you to figure out, what are 30 things, because with a Talk Walker account, you get 30 free keywords, what are 30 things that if somebody was talking about it on the Internet, you would know those are your people? What could those 30 things be? So, for me, with my podcast, Tracing the Path, one of those was the story that I did about the authors of the Curious George, Margaret and H A Ray.

[00:05:28.910] - Dan
I don't know if you know this, but Margaret and H A Ray were living in Paris right before World War II when the Germans were invading, and they actually escaped Paris on a bicycle that they built with a basket. And in the basket, they had the manuscript for the Curious George book. You know, it's kind of like, how amazing is that? Well, so they were escaping Nazi Germany. It's a World War II tale.

[00:05:56.830] - Dan
It's Curious george. So, I know if anyone is talking about the history of children's books, they might be interested in the podcast episode about Curious George, right? So, history of children's books, that is something people actually talk about.

[00:06:11.530] - Dan
There are actual children's book historians, there's librarians, there's children's book librarians. There's all kinds of people who would be interested in that particular story. So, go through your blog or your podcast or whatever and think about, all right, what are the topics, what are the things? And even in a more granular way, more specific, more helpful would be to pull out either 30 podcast episodes or 30 blog posts or 30 YouTube videos, right? And figure out, all right, what is the main point of this? What is the keyword?

[00:06:46.080] - Dan
What is the type of person that would be interested in this particular piece of content? And we're going to put those into Talkwalker. Now, what Talkwalker does is every single day it scours the entire Internet, which I don't know how it's possible, but they do for whatever word or words you put into it. So, if you're putting in children historian, then anytime the word children historian ever comes up on the Internet, not children historian, children's book historian, anytime that comes up on the Internet, you're going to get an email.

[00:07:23.650] - Dan
And for the most part, you can set it up so you can get one every day. Thus, need 20 minutes drinking your hot chocolate or coffee in the morning. So, if somebody and people don't usually say this, but if somebody on Twitter says, hi, I'm Stan, I'm a children's book historian, you will get an email tomorrow morning, or you could set it up for today that says, hey, here's a tweet that might be of interest to you, and you'll take you directly to it. It will be Stan's account.

[00:07:53.440] - Dan
And you'll see the tweet on your screen. It will say, hey, I'm a children's book historian. Now, this is a potential reader of your blog. This is a potential listener of your podcast. So, what if you said, oh, that is fascinating.

[00:08:06.870] - Dan
I actually have a blog where I talk about children's books, right? That would be interesting to the person, potentially, and maybe here's my favorite one, what do you know about the story? Or maybe even you're researching a story and you actually need help. Maybe you already know that you're working on another blog post and you're like, hey, a children's books historian, I'm working on a project, what do you know about X? Like, you found a potential reader., Now you create a conversation. So, you could get 30 of those every morning and go through them and find out which ones could actually become listeners or which ones could become readers. Who are these people?

[00:08:50.140] - Dan
Because some of them, this particular children's book historian might work at a library. The library might have the newsletter, and the newsletter might need content, and the guy just needs access to content. So, as you can see, if you did this 30 times every day, every morning, and reached out to people who are actual, real-life potential readers or listeners of your content, that over time, that can really build into something. But what I have found is that there's a more important, like, side feature to this strategy that I didn't know at the beginning. Because what I just described to you is what I attempted in the beginning, is I'll just use my 20 minutes to reach people who have a direct interest in what it is that I'm talking about.

[00:09:38.740] - Dan
And in fact, we had a client who had a house plants blog, and she ended up talking to all kinds of people who just were experts at house plants, gardeners, people who love to talk about the different house plants, and, you know, the different lighting and where do you put it in the house, and different, you know does your house face north? Where should you put it?

[00:09:57.130] - Dan
All those kinds of things. And she ended up creating this huge community of people who love house plants and that ended up being the people who bought the ebook and all that other stuff. But there was another aspect to this that I didn't know at first. My wife is crawling behind me to reach something. Okay, that was funny. that was funny. So, the thing that I didn't know was going to happen is I put in keywords. For instance, I have a post about the history of pizza and it just so happens that history of pizza is tied to the cholera epidemic. So, I found somebody talking about cholera in Italy on using Talkwalker, I think I had changed some keywords at that point.

[00:10:56.370] - Dan
And then I was just like, well, maybe there are people who are talking about cholera. So, I found somebody talking about cholera and I said, hey, I see that you were talking about cholera. I don't know if you know this or not, but because of cholera, that is why we have pizza. And I included the link to the episode and she listened to it and she wrote back, you have made my day. I am a cholera historian and I'm putting this in my newsletter immediately.

[00:11:27.700] - Dan
Like all of a sudden she had some enormous database of people interested in cholera. And now I have all kinds of new listeners because I found this one person on Twitter. The same thing happened with the Curious George episode, is the National Museum, Holocaust Museum found, I saw them tweeting about something. And I sent them a little note that said, hey, I don't know if you know this, but the writers of Curious George actually escaped Germany. They were Jewish writers.

[00:12:01.200] - Dan
They escaped Germany and thus escaped the Holocaust. And so, they put the information into the National Holocaust newsletter. And it's been there three times.

[00:12:14.060] - Dan
I did a story on Paul Harvey, who's a radio guy, and he got into radio because his music teacher took him to the radio station. So, I was talking about that on Twitter with a music teacher. And then the music teacher ended up sharing that with other music teachers and they shared that with other music teachers because guess what? Here's a music teacher then ends up being a hero in a story. They led a young boy to the radio and then the radio guy became famous.

[00:12:42.340] - Dan
So, they had a vested interest in sharing the story with all of the music teachers because it made everybody feel good. Like, yes, here's a cool story about something a music teacher did. So, I want you to think about that with your content. Like, can you find 30 pieces of content? And remember, this is just 30 today.

[00:13:07.810] - Dan
You can change them, you can alter them and the one thing that you will find out is that you'll put in keywords in the Talkwalker. Like I have an episode about the Oregon Trail game and how it is directly tied to the history of Apple computers. Like if the Oregon Trail game wasn't around, Apple computers wouldn't be around either. So I started putting in history of Apple. Like who's talking about the history of Apple?

[00:13:34.470] - Dan
Well, I found out very quickly that many people talk about the history of apple pie, and that was not a good use of time getting an email with a list of people talking about the history of apple pie. So, you might want to do a little brush up on your Boolean search terms because I had to change my search in Talkwalker from history of apple to history of apple in quotes and then minus p i e, minus pie because I didn't want Talkwalker to bring back anything that had to do with apple pie, just Apple computers.
