[00:00:13.310] - Liz, Host
Hey, guys, I'm super excited about our next guest. She is a returning speaker. She's part of the very first Blogger Breakthrough summit. But before I tell you a little bit about her, I need to give you guys just a quick disclaimer because we are both attorneys. But while we are attorneys, we're are not your attorneys. And this is not legal advice. We don't know your specifics, it's for informational, educational purposes only. If you aren't sure what you should do, you should consult with an attorney. Okay. Alright.

[00:00:38.580] - Liz, Host
So, our next guest is the founder and owner of Hashtag Legal. She's been practicing for 16 years, working with entrepreneurs and has a deep desire to really make legal accessible. So, she's a regular speaker at conferences. And like I said, she's been here before. I'm super excited to welcome Jamie Lieberman from Hashtag Legal. Jamie, welcome.

[00:00:59.640] - Jamie
Thanks for having me.

[00:01:01.210] - Liz, Host
Yeah, I'm super excited to have you back. So, last time you were here, we were talking about kind of intellectual property, like trademarks copyrights. And we'll touch on that. But I kind of want to talk about the mistakes people make with intellectual property this time just to give it a little bit of difference. So, where would you say people get in trouble when it comes to intellectual property or IP, which we might shorten it to?

[00:01:29.270] - Jamie
Oh, my gosh, how much time do we have? No, I'm just kidding. There's a couple of areas. And so, I think we should break it down by trademark and copyright because they're two very different areas. So, before I launch into that, I'm going to do a quick just definition of each. You know trademark being your name, your brand name as you know, let's call it your source Identifier. So what you do business as and it can be your words. It can be your logo. If you use me. As an example, Hashtag Legal is my word Mark.

[00:02:01.260] - Jamie
And then I have an actual logo, both of which are registered trademarks. Even if you haven't registered your name, you still do get some protection. So that's your trademark and then copyright is just the rights that you have in the works that you create. So, your website, your photos, your blog posts, videos, all of the above. And so, there are sort of two different areas where I see issues. The first area is nobody bothering to look at their intellectual property and say, one, can I use it?

[00:02:35.780] - Jamie
And two, how can I protect it? And then the third way that I see people sort of making mistakes is just using other people's intellectual property incorrectly. So, those are sort of the broad areas where I see people have issues in their business.

[00:02:53.610] - Liz, Host
Alright. So, let's dig deeper first into how people are incorrectly using other people's intellectual property, because I feel like that's going to get you in trouble faster. 

[00:03:04.690] - Jamie
Yes. Yes. So, in connection with copyright, that one's pretty simple, right. And many people listening may have had this experience where someone lifts your photo and they use it for themselves. Sometimes people give attribution and say, oh, but I tagged you. This is called infringement. So, when you use somebody else's intellectual property without a license or permission, that's the term license. You are essentially potentially infringing on someone's intellectual property. So, if somebody decides to use your photo, they don't ask you for permission. Maybe they tag you. That's still infringement.

[00:03:41.050] - Jamie
Just because you give attribution does not solve your infringement problem. So that's a big area use of photos, videos, music, blog posts, anything, use of anything anyone else has created that you have not asked for permission for. That's a huge problem, and that can actually be really expensive in the copyright world.

[00:04:04.290] - Liz, Host
Yeah. And I feel like we see this a lot like yes, roundup posts and blog posts, but also just in social media Instagram. I feel like it's constantly coming up. People haven't learned their lesson.

[00:04:13.500] - Jamie
They can't just repost someone's post and you write repost doesn't fix it.

[00:04:18.960] - Liz, Host
No Pinterest and all that. Okay. So how would someone go about getting permission or finding out what the license options are?

[00:04:28.690] - Jamie
Yeah. So, the first piece of advice I have is if you have a fellow blogger and you want to do a roundup or you love their image or you want to shout them out, ask for permission. And it can be something as simple as a DM. It does not have to be this epic license that you sign, and it's 15 pages long. It could literally be sending a message to somebody saying, hey, I love that photo. Do you mind if I posted on my Instagram, I'll give you attribution? And if they write back and say yes, you're good to go.

[00:04:57.810] - Jamie
That's all you really need. Now, this is a little bit different for professional photographers. Professional photographers have extremely strict and frankly, very lengthy licenses and almost always are going to request money in connection with the use of their images. And so, it just depends on who you're talking to and it can be a wide range. My first piece of advice is to ask. If they don't answer, don't use it. If someone says yes and gives you parameters for use, follow those parameters. And that's a very simple way.

[00:05:29.210] - Jamie
Email, DM, just save it. If you have a DM, just screenshot it and save it in your file. So you have it in case somebody comes back around and says, hey, I didn't give you that permission. You want to hold on to it. So that's really important, too. So that's one way. Another way is to actually go to a website and purchase a license. Licenses are overwhelming. They're long if you go to. I mean, I get lots of emails from clients saying, I don't even know if I can use what I've bought in the way that I want to. So, you know there's a lot of times one sort of really good trick is if you go into some of the stock photo licensing, and I'm not sure about the free ones.

[00:06:08.200] - Jamie
I very much say, stay away from the free ones. But if you're talking about a subscription or some kind of model, they have FAQs often that will explain what their licenses mean really really well. So, some of the really good ones that are well known, just to go to the FAQ and see if the use that you want is appropriate for how you're using it. This is the same with, like, podcast music. That's a big one where you're almost always going to use what's called royalty free music.

[00:06:35.090] - Jamie
You pay a flat fee, you're able to use it in your podcast. YouTube videos are the same. So, all of those things I think are important to just know what license you're buying.

[00:06:53.270] - Liz, Host
You know it's turning on. I'm sorry. Yes, so, because I feel like a lot of people get really concerned or completely oblivious and then side, you know side way trying to figure it out. Okay. So, going back to the other way you said people get into trouble. We kind of talked about, can they use it? But the next part you said was, how do they protect it? So, let's touch on that and mistakes people make in thinking maybe they're predicted when they're not.

[00:07:20.210] - Jamie
So, copyright and trademark are very different. And we didn't also can touch on how you're potentially using someone else's trademark incorrectly. But maybe we'll circle back to that at some point. But let's talk about how we can protect. So, copyright and trademark both, you have the option to register with the US Patent and Trademark Office or the US Copyright Office. So, trademarks go to the USPTO Copyright registrations go to the US Copyright Office. And so, if you have something that you've created and so typically for bloggers, I see that with ebooks.

[00:07:56.160] - Jamie
I see that with downloads, courses are a huge one. Any digital product that you're creating, if you want to make sure that you can stop infringers in the most easy way possible. That's why you need copyright registration. So, when you create something, you automatically have copyright rights in them. And that includes the right to give away your Copyright, to keep it for yourself, to ask other people to stop using your images or whatever copyright protected work that you have. However, if you don't have a registration, there are certain benefits that you're not getting.

[00:08:33.010] - Jamie
So, if you have a copyright registration, you're able to sue in federal court for copyright infringement. When you sue, you will get, you can get, I should say, attorney's fees, meaning your fees that you had to pay your lawyer. The other side will have to pay them if you prevail. And then also you can get something called statutory damages, which means I don't have to prove how I'm damaged. And that's really powerful. So, when you get those cease and desist you know when cease and desist gets sent around and there's a copyright registration attached.

[00:09:07.930] - Jamie
People start to pay attention because it's really hard to defend against copyright infringement if somebody has a valid registration. So, copyright registration is really critical now. Shockingly, the US government is not caught up to the 21st century and so, it is challenging for really prolific content creators like bloggers. There is a new sort of application that you can use to register your actual blog, like on a quarterly basis. But it's a really really really narrow usage. And so, I'd say talk to a lawyer because copyright registration can be really a bit complicated, and it's something that's kind of difficult to do on your own.

[00:09:48.640] - Jamie
So, there are ways to protect your actual blog. But you need to make sure that you're using it correctly and you don't want to waste a lot of time and money and then get rejected by the Copyright office. So, it's definitely worthwhile at least talking to someone to see what a good registration strategy is. And sometimes it just doesn't even make sense to register. Sometimes you pick and choose certain things that you've created that make a lot more sense. Trademarks are a whole other story. 

[00:10:17.090] - Jamie
Trademark, you, like I said, the same with copyright. If you're using a name or a logo and you haven't registered it, you do have rights in the name or logo. But those rights are narrow, and so, you don't get the great protections that you do if you get your trademark registered. And so, you're limited by sort of your exact use, meaning the goods and services that are connected to the trademark as you are currently using them. You're limited to the geographic area in which you are using them, which in the world of the internet is sometimes a little amorphous, and people have a hard time sort of understanding that.

[00:10:50.440] - Jamie
But it will be limited by geographic restraints, even if you are a nationwide blogger. And finally, you know the same with doing in federal court. It's much easier if you have a trademark registration. So, you also get a much wider protection. You get nationwide protection, and you also get to stop people who are using a same or similar trademark in connection with the same or similar goods and services. That's a lot wider than just your typical sort of you know  use based rights that you get if you don't register your trademark.

[00:11:26.850] - Jamie
Sure.

[00:11:28.730] - Liz, Host
So, registering is number one protected, obviously. But registering isn't the end all deal. Because if you aren't being proactive, correct me if I'm wrong and going after people that are trying to use it, then those protections can go away. You want to explain that better than I did?

[00:11:49.470] - Jamie
Yeah. No, no no. You're absolutely right. So, one important thing that I like to remind people of is your intellectual property is only as strong as you're willing to fight for it. And that is very exhausting for people who may not want to engage in conflict. But if you do want to protect your IP, if you do want to make sure that other people are not able to use it, if you do register your copyrights, if you do register your trademarks, if someone is infringing, if you see and I highly recommend you set up Google searches. 

[00:12:18.480] - Jamie
Lawyers often, you know we have a service where we monitor trademark applications on behalf of our clients and say, hey, this is potentially infringing. You're going to need to reach out and say, hey, I have a registered Mark and you're infringing on my Mark. And that requires a little bit of back and forth. So, you do have to be prepared if you want to protect your Mark, to basically prosecute the Mark, which means make sure that you're stopping people from infringing on what you've created.

[00:12:49.250] - Liz, Host
Yes. Okay. So, let's go ahead and touch on how people may be using go back and using trademarking correctly or using someone's trademarking correctly.

[00:12:59.880] - Jamie
Yeah. So, a big one is when we decide we love the name of our company. Right. We wake up one morning and we have this lightbulb effect and we're like, oh, my gosh, I'm going to use my company name because it's easy, Hashtag Legal. I fell in love with that name. I was like, I must have that name. And so, the big mistake I see is people don't clear the name, meaning check to make sure that someone else didn't have that bright idea and that there's not somebody else out there who's using a Mark that's the same or similar to yours in connection with the same or similar goods and services.

[00:13:30.550] - Jamie
And so to piggyback on that, that may sound very simple, but that analysis is incredibly complex. And I highly recommend that you talk to a trademark attorney before choosing a name, particularly if you're paying a marketing or branding person. They are absolutely not checking and clearing your name. If they have a good contract, they're going to tell you they're not checking or clearing the name. They're also not checking or clearing your logo. And if they're using stock sites, some of them, like, Canva, for example, you are not able to register a logo made in Canva for trademark protection because you might be using some of their stock images, and that isn't allowed.

[00:14:07.410] - Jamie
So, it is really important that you're checking on these things and making sure that everybody's talking to everybody else. So, if you have a wonderful idea, if you fall in love with the name, I highly highly recommend that you make sure that you can use that name before you invest any resources into marketing or creating a website or a logo or any one of those things. And to piggyback on that merely because a URL or social media channel is available does not necessarily mean that the trademark is clear.

[00:14:40.060] - Jamie
I hear it all the time. They're like, oh, but I bought the URL or but I have the social channel. That's meaningless. It does not matter.

[00:14:47.570] - Liz, Host
Yes. And just because you have those doesn't mean you'll get approved for three months later or something. So, I do want to go back because I feel like you know when we say in connection to a similar goods or service, I think some people might get freaked out like, oh, someone has that name, but it could be completely different. So, can you maybe just give an example or two or just explain that a little more clearly so that people understand the difference?

[00:15:11.260] - Jamie
Yeah. So let's use blogs, for example, because that's a fairly simple one. So, blogs are typically registered. When we say similar goods and services. We're talking about the class of the trademark and the trademark office looks at classes based on numbers. So, class 41 is the number that is typically used for blogs. And so, in class 41 is websites. It can be educational services, it can be entertainment services, so it starts to get broader and broader and broader. And so, if I have a blog called Hashtag Legal, let's just say that I created a blog called Hashtag Legal, and we write all about legal stuff.

[00:15:48.230] - Jamie
And then somebody else wants to create a podcast called Hashtag Legal. And I've registered my Mark for my blog. I could likely stop that person because the odds are the podcast is similar enough to the blog that it could be confusing that people would think I created the podcast even if I hadn't. So, it extends out. Or if someone created a course, a digital course. That's another similar service to my blog even if I've never created a course. And I get those rights and protections with my registered trademark.

[00:16:19.470] - Jamie
So that's really important, because I am basically extending out not necessarily my rights. But what I'm doing is I'm able to stop other people from creating goods and services that people may think I'm creating because I've established all the goodwill in the name Hashtag Legal. And if you hear Hashtag Legal, you think of our company. Someone were to go out and create a digital course called about law called Hashtag Legal. That'd be an issue for me because people might think they're buying from me. So, I would be able to likely stop somebody from using that name.

[00:16:49.730] - Liz, Host
Yes. But if someone is selling cars and it's like Hashtag Legal Cars, right? That's different. They can do that because someone is not going to get confused thinking of you.

[00:17:00.960] - Jamie
Exactly. That's the real test.

[00:17:03.220] - Liz, Host
Yes. Okay. So, what sort of actions can people take if they've maybe already made some of these mistakes to kind of fix them?

[00:17:14.570] - Jamie
So, my first piece of advice is, do not panic. We're not allowed to freak out. If you've not done some of the things that I'm talking about. The future is now we can start. So, I'd say when it comes to your website, I think you should do. And this happens to clients all the time. Do an audit of your site. Look at the photos that you posted. Like eight years ago because back then, people weren't talking about this stuff and nobody knew that. You couldn't just like Google image, search something and pull it off the Internet.

[00:17:44.710] - Jamie
I have clients that get cease and desist for use of a photo that they literally posted eight years ago and forgot. So, go back and do an audit of your site. Look at where you are using photos, replace those photos, do it slowly other time. You don't have to do it all day. I mean, every single day. It doesn't have to happen tomorrow, but make it a point to really audit your site and get rid of those stock photos you are using that. You don't know if you have a license for.

[00:18:08.540] - Jamie
That's number one. Number two, take a look at your name, check it out. Google it go into the Trademark Offices database. You can find that if you search TESS. That's the USPTO database for all trademarks, do a quick search to see what comes up. I will warn you, it is not the most user friendly of databases. It is really hard, but at minimum you will see if there's an exact match, or you will see if there's something glaring. Do some Google searches, look around and see if people are using the name that's the same as yours.

[00:18:42.470] - Jamie
The similar names is the really hard part. So, I do recommend that if you've been using your Mark for a really long time and you've never had an issue, the odds of you having an issue aren't huge, but could come up. If you're relatively new and you've just started using a name, that's a different story. But no matter how far along you are, I definitely recommend clearing it. And then having a conversation with an attorney and seeing whether or not trademark registration makes sense for you. For some people, it doesn't.

[00:19:09.840] - Jamie
So, I do want to be clear, like not every person needs to do all this stuff. And this is why having a good relationship with the lawyer and just sitting down and doing a little bit of strategy will help you decide clients absolutely walk in the door of my offices and I say, yeah, I don't think you should do that. Like don't put your resources into that. Let's focus on something else. So, strategy is really key.

[00:19:29.570] - Liz, Host
Okay. Yeah, and I do because I have played around with the I'm not a patent trademark IP specialist in any way. But I've gone in there and I've looked and it'll tell you the exact match, but it's not going to tell you if there's something similar. So that's where an attorney is very important. Okay, so, let me rethink how I'm going to phrase this question. If they are just starting out because I know a lot of the attendees at the summit are just starting out. They may not be watching this more advanced session, but what actions do they need to take to get them fix?

[00:20:09.530] - Liz, Host
Because you said you know copyright and trademark may not always be the right fit. What are other things they should be doing to sort of avoid problems?

[00:20:20.370] - Jamie
Having an understanding, a very basic understanding of each area of law. So, understanding copyright, understand how you can use other people's work. Understand what it means when if you have somebody contribute to your blog. Because that's another issue that I see come up a lot with copyright is people start to hire contributors or they go on those VA Facebook groups. And the VA is like, I have a recipe. You can use ten of them. And here's your photos. And then all of a sudden you realize this VA has not made sure that they are not original photos.

[00:20:52.910] - Jamie
So, know your sources, from who you are buying from and what you are posting, because even if the VA sold you a bad photo, if it's on your website, you are liable. So, it's really important. I think one really great thing is to just know where the sources of information is coming from, make sure that you have the licenses that you need, ask the right questions. And really get it in writing and save those licenses. And like I said, it does not have to be anything really super complicated.

[00:21:23.590] - Jamie
Just ask for permission and get it with the VA. Those are a little bit different. They are a bit risky because I have seen, unfortunately, some VA relationships go wrong with VAs that are using images that are not theirs, things like that. So, having an understanding of the sources of what you're putting up on your website and also a basic understanding of copyright law and a basic understanding of trademark law. And there are resources out there for sure to sort of give you those baseline information.

[00:21:54.210] - Jamie
That's good. But make sure you're getting that information from a lawyer because I see a lot of non lawyers talking about this. And copyright and trademark are probably two of the most complicated areas of law that you can practice. So, forming a relationship with an attorney early on is a great idea. I know a lot of people.

[00:22:12.500] - Liz, Host
I see attorney specifically.

[00:22:14.150] - Jamie
Yes. Thank you. And I know a lot of people think, oh, my gosh, that's so expensive. I can never do that. I can't afford it. I'll tell you that I offer, you know in our practice, we have, like, 30 minutes strategy sessions that we offer to clients just to come in to have a conversation. And maybe I don't hear from someone for another year after that because that's all they needed from us. And it is a really great investment to make, because a year or two, when things start to grow and get bigger, the client and I know each other already and they can come back and do what needs to get done.

[00:22:41.330] - Jamie
So, look for things like that. It's not as overwhelmingly expensive as you think.

[00:22:47.010] - Liz, Host
Yes. Alright. A couple of follow ups on that. Guest post. I'm just going to say guest post, and you tell me what comes to mind.

[00:22:58.980] - Jamie
Yeah. I mean, it's the same idea with contributors, like whether you're paying them, whether it's free, whether it's a trade. I know everybody loves the guest post because it helps you. Right. Like it's less work for you. But understand that the guest poster is not the one who's going to get the cease and desist, you are as the owner of the website. So, it isn't just important that, you know and trust the person who's providing the guest post and make sure that they can tell you and show you that either one the photos are original.

[00:23:30.760] - Jamie
The words are original. Yes. Exactly. They have those online. Those are fairly simple to do, but just make sure that you're getting original work.

[00:23:43.030] - Liz, Host
Yes. Okay. So, you've mentioned keep track of your licenses, your permission. Do you have any tips on how to keep that organized and how people should kind of keep that you know all that information because it can add up over the years and try later.

[00:24:01.180] - Jamie
For sure. Yeah. So, wherever you save the photo, whatever that organization looks like, and you should save all of your photos. You should not just upload them and then delete them. Wherever you save your photos, save your license next to it. That way they're right there together, whether it's one big giant folder or it's broken up by blog post, however, your assets are saved. Just save the license with the photo. That's the easiest thing.

[00:24:25.210] - Liz, Host
So, you can find it.

[00:24:26.410] - Jamie
Exactly.

[00:24:29.810] - Liz, Host
Screenshot dated 10-2007-19 is a lot harder to dig and find than when you've taken the time to just rename it, 30 seconds. Alright. So, we are running out of time. Is there anything else you think people need to know in terms of mistakes or just in general, copyright trademark.

[00:25:00.030] - Jamie
I think the most important thing is to just not be afraid of it, not run away from it. Find really good resources and just educate yourself a bit about anything else. Like you've learned WordPress. I'm guessing you did not start knowing WordPress. You've also learned how to edit photos. Maybe you were a photographer. You've learned how to blog. View this as just another tool in your toolbox that you need, because this is a business that you're running. If you're here, it means you're making this a business.

[00:25:27.640] - Jamie
And so, it's important to treat it like a business. So, don't run from it. The legal stuff, not just IP, but everything, all the legal stuff, the basics, those foundations are critical for your business. And the sooner that you sort of wrap your head around them, the better. So, I'd say just really sit down strategize with an attorney. Find someone that you trust. Educate yourself, find some really good resources out there and you'll sleep at night because you'll know that you're covered. So that's the biggest piece of advice that I have.

[00:26:00.190] - Liz, Host
Yes. Alright. And then I think you have some resources that would be great for attendees to check out talk and about this.

[00:26:06.180] - Jamie
Yeah. So, we actually do have mini courses that you can check out on contracts, trademark, copyright, privacy, website terms, all kinds of good stuff. We made them really accessible so that you'd be able to at least get that little bit of information. You can find our courses and frankly, information about us. And we have a lot of resources on our website at hashtaglegal.com. The name of our courses are called the uUnbusiness School. So, you'll see a link at the top. You can just click on that and check out our courses.

[00:26:40.570] - Jamie
You also can go to our Instagram where I actually post like lots of videos, lots of information, just quick tips, which is hashtag_legal is our handle, all spelled out, hashtag spelled out and everything. And my YouTube channel is Jamie Lieberman rocks.

[00:26:58.770] - Liz, Host
I love it. Fantastic. So, guys, definitely go check those out. Jamie obviously knows her stuff. I'm probably going to go check some of those out myself because again, trademark copyright, not my jam. Jamie, thank you so much for being here. Any last words, anything you want to add?

[00:27:16.310] - Jamie
Oh, yeah. Thanks for having me. This is great.
