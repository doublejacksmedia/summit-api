Liz Stapleton [00:00:00]:
Alright, guys. Today, we're here with Jennifer Dawn who's going to be talking about mindset, and I'm so excited about this session. Jennifer, thank you so much for for doing this and being part of the summit. I greatly appreciate it.

Jennifer Dawn [00:00:11]:
You are so welcome. I'm excited to be here and mindset is like my all time favorite topic. So it's I love talking about it. So I'm honored to be here. Yes. Because I mean, I've been blogging

Liz Stapleton [00:00:21]:
for over 5 years, which sounds crazy to me. And I can even, you know, I I can look back and see when mindset shifts help me push further. And I can even look down. I'm like, I'm making my sessions and how I look at my business this year. I can tell. as and I so I'm just excited to dig into this because one of those things that just feel like the tiniest things some times that will shift in perspective or that recognition of a fear can make such a difference. Yeah. So do you wanna give us before we dive in, can you give us a little bit about your background and just sort of touch on what we're gonna cover today?

Jennifer Dawn [00:00:55]:
Sure. Absolutely. And so, let's see, I started my first company when I was eight years old, and I had an apple stand outside my grandfather's chiropractic office. I bought an lemonade stand was, like, so old school, and I was like, I'm not doing that. And so but I remember being eight years old and just it it was always it was such, was such a wonderful feeling to me to have an idea because my grandfather's office had patients coming in and out an apple tree right in the front yard and I was like, I'm gonna sell all those patients apples and I did. because I think, I think my grandmother had made the comment how there's so many apples going to waste on the ground. And I was just like, oh, well, I can go out pick up the good ones and sell them.

Liz Stapleton [00:01:34]:
doctor's office, an apple a day.

Jennifer Dawn [00:01:36]:
Right? Right. Exactly. Right. Like, how it was really my most perfect business. If I could go back and just have that It would be it would be awesome, but I just remember like holding those shiny quarters in my hand and being so just enthralled with the idea that I had an idea and I turned it into money. And then with that money, I could go do things. And so, I think that's where I really just kinda got that entrepreneurial spirit. And so, I've grown two 7 figure businesses. I'm actually on track for my 3rd right now. I was in software with my other 2 companies and with this company now, I'm a coach. I'm a whole life business coach, and I am also the founder of best planner ever, best journal ever, an author. And so that's me. And, I guess my favorite thing is that the business that I have right now is is aside from the Apple stand is absolutely my favorite business that I created this business in a completely different mindset and So I can look back at the way I I created my first two companies and how I've created this company and just like the differences are are so truly significant and really mindset is at the core of all of it. Mhmm.

Liz Stapleton [00:02:47]:
Yeah. No. I'm excited. So do you wanna give us, like, touch on the highlights of what you wanna cover in your session today so we can -- Yeah.

Jennifer Dawn [00:02:55]:
Absolutely. So some things I'd love to touch on, when we talk about mindset, mindset's a very general word, and that can include a lot of different things. And so I'd love to touch on what to do when you're feeling stuck. You know, if you have something that you've been working on, even if it's been like 6 months a year or more and you haven't seen forward was progress with it, like how to get your mindset into a place, how to shift out of that, and how to start getting that forward momentum going again. if you're if you're just getting started and it's all feeling like super overwhelming, I'd love to sit and, you know, love to talk a little bit about just overwhelm itself and how to step out of it. that again is another tool in your toolbox when you're feeling overwhelmed because any entrepreneur, blogger, anybody out there trying to make their own way is gonna experience overwhelm and you need to know, you need to be prepared for it. You need to know how to get out of it. So I'd love to shift on that. I'd love just to talk about that a little bit. And, let's see. Oh, and then another thing I'd love to touch on is up leveling. So, like, you've gotten to a certain spot and you're just like, how in the world do I get to the next spot? I just seem to be kind of stagnant or stuck, you know, like, where I'm at, and I seem to break through to that next level. Love to talk about how to do that.

Liz Stapleton [00:04:06]:
Okay. Yes. I'm excited for all those things because feel like they all really apply to blogging. Uh-huh. Especially because, I mean, especially if you're you're here at the summit, you're probably taking in so much information. and there's there's it's there's such great actionable sessions that you probably have a to do list a mile long, and and hopefully the system sessions will help you with that, but can also feel overwhelming, and we don't want want that. So, I'm gonna let you take over and kinda kick it off, and and I'm gonna just pop in with questions.

Jennifer Dawn [00:04:38]:
Okay. So let's talk about, let's let's start at the very beginning. So let's just say that you are, just starting. And it probably seems a little overwhelming, and you're you're getting all of this information. And maybe you don't have an audience. You don't have a community yet. You don't have a following. You might even be feeling like everybody else is already so far ahead of me. Like, what's the point of even starting? I'm sure that, you know, I know I have felt that before sometimes when I've started something new and it's just like, oh my gosh, you start seeing what everybody else is doing and they're so far ahead. that is just like, ah, I just feel like I I don't even know where to begin. So again, we're gonna tie this back to mindset. And so where do you begin? And so one of the places that I like to begin is always with some type, and this is this may or may not be anything you've ever heard of for, but I call it a clearing statement. And so with the clearing statement, it's basically a statement of intention, and the idea behind it is to clear my path of wherever I want to go. And so what would I be clearing my path? So in your path could be things like limiting beliefs, know, everybody else is so far ahead of me. I'm never gonna be able to catch up. Like, that right there is a limiting belief. If you're saying to yourself, gosh, I don't really think that I have anything to offer. Right? Or what do I

Liz Stapleton [00:05:58]:
really know?

Jennifer Dawn [00:05:59]:
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Who would be listening to me? Again, all of the things are just limiting beliefs. I don't have I don't know what to do. I really don't know what the next steps are. That's a little bit of a lie. That's kind of baloney. It's like, yeah, you you kinda do know what do. You may just not know what to do it, what what to do. So we wanna clear any limiting beliefs. We wanna clear any lies that we picked up We wanna clear any fears that we might be feeling. I always like to clear anything that's stopping me from changing. Mhmm. Because If you want something different to come into your life or you wanna get to that next level, you've gotta be willing to change. Everything can stay the same. Right? If it's gonna change, you have to be willing to change. And so I like to clear anything that's stopping me from making any change. I like to clear any judgments around it. Like, any of this kind of gunk. Okay? And so I always start with a clearing statement. And, again, it's just an attention statement that says, I release, I clear. You can use whatever word you want. I use clear release and let go a lot. I don't know why those word words work for me, but I just clear release and let go. Anything blocking my progress, anything stopping me, any place where I'm not aware. Any information that I'm choosing not to see, you know, any fear around getting to the next level. Just wanna set my intention to clear clear clear, release, and let all of that go. So that's one of the first things that I like to do is just sort of clear the path. Now if you are really struggling with a lot of negative emotion around it. And let's face it. You know, a lot of us, have been through some junk, you know, the reasons why you're gonna start blogging, Who knows? So if you're struggling with a lot of negative emotion, one of the things I do suggest here is that you actually journal it out. And I know, like, people listening like, oh god. Like, I don't wanna draw it out. Okay. But I use a different journaling exercise. And so with the journaling exercise. And this is actually what, sparked me to create my best journal ever was because I found this to be so powerful and so effective when we talk about shifting your mindset. Okay? You've got this huge, like, obstacle you're trying to get through. And so any emotion that you're feeling around it, 15, 20 minutes, just journal it out. Like, however you're feeling, you can say whatever you need to say, you're scared, if you're angry, if whatever it happens to be, but you just wanna journal all that stuff out. Yep. But then you take the pages and you rip them up and you throw them away. Right? This is not a journal anybody ever comes back to read including yourself. And that's part of what makes it so powerful is because if you know, nobody's gonna come back and read it. It sort of opens the door for you to go where you need to go to purge all that junk out. And and and I'm kind of overlapping a little bit here because the journaling will work for overwhelmed too. It will work for exhaustion, frustration, any emotion that you're feeling, how

Liz Stapleton [00:08:52]:
-- -- of getting it out.

Jennifer Dawn [00:08:54]:
Exactly. And that exercise is so good. And what I noticed is that if I set the timer for 20 minutes and I just, like, go to town, blah blah blah. What will happen is I'll kinda clear through that layer of gunk, and I'll notice it'll start to get information. I'll start to get clarity. I'll start to learn a lesson. I'll start to reconnect with my gratitude. Like, those good, positive mindset things that it's just hard to put ourselves in. That journaling exercise will really, really help me do that. And so If you're struggling with any sort of negative emotion, oh my gosh, you're bloggers. If you're having writer's block, even if you're just like so mad because you're just like, I don't know what to write. I journal that out and just be like, I'm so mad. I don't know what to write. And then just keep writing and keep writing push through it, and you'll feel it release once you kinda get through that gunk. And then it's like the gates of having opening. You're like, woah. Okay. Okay. I get it now. And then he gets to rip it up and throw it away and never look at it again, and you don't have to go to therapy or anything.

Liz Stapleton [00:10:02]:
or burning in the fire pit outside.

Jennifer Dawn [00:10:04]:
Burn it in the fire pit. You know, I rip it up and I put it in the dumpster, like, whatever is. Read it

Liz Stapleton [00:10:10]:
if you want. You know? Yeah. But that's

Jennifer Dawn [00:10:12]:
the power. Yeah. Is knowing nobody's ever gonna see it. That's what really gives you that permission to go wherever you need to go, then you can let that stuff out. And then from there, that's where you're gonna start to get more clarity and focus and and all of those good, positive mindset attributes that you're gonna need to be successful.

Liz Stapleton [00:10:30]:
Yeah. And I think when you're having to put it out, right, it kind of forces you to take a step back. and look at what are those things that are holding you back or, like I said, a limiting belief, or maybe it's just a belief could be sometimes a belief system that you were kind of brought up in that really doesn't apply to how you're living your life or something, but it's just something you've never even thought about being -- That's right. -- could be different.

Jennifer Dawn [00:10:52]:
That's right. Exactly. No. Because ultimately, you know, it's kind of it's the beginning of a new year, and so many people, like, give resolutions, like, a bad wrap. and I don't like that because I'm like resolutions work if 2 things happen. 1, your mindset shifts. You know, you start thinking differently. and 2, your behaviors shift. You start behaving differently. If you shift your thinking and you shift your behaviors, you can meet any real resolution that you set. It's when you set a resolution and then you just stay in the same thinking space and doing space that of course it's not gonna work. doesn't matter what time of year it is. So, you know, here we are at the beginning of a year. And if you're just like, you know what? I'm gonna I'm gonna blog this many times a or whatever times a week. You know, I'm gonna get my community, my following up to this many. You can totally do it, but only if you shift your thinking and you if your behaviors, that's how you're gonna be able to get there.

Liz Stapleton [00:11:48]:
Yeah. No. I like that a lot. because, yeah, it's it's and What I found in my experience is sometimes it's the tiniest shift that just starts the, like, you know, rolling the ball that I'm, you know, all of a sudden I'm moving forward. And I feel like there it is spurts, right, where I'm like, Hoosh. And then I stuck And I'm like, wait. What happens? You know? So so maybe we could talk about kind of when you hit those plataus or when you get stuck and you're just like, wait a second. I was doing so good. What happened? Right.

Jennifer Dawn [00:12:21]:
Exactly. I love it. I love it. and it's interesting because we wanna talk about comfort zone. Right? So you're in your comfort zone. Things are going along really nice, and you're just like, yahoo. Here we go. And you're doing everything you need to do, and it's working and you're like, great. Okay. And so you kinda and then you hit this plateau where you're just like, wait, what a second? Because you're in a comfort zone. and I like to think of it as it's like, wait a second. When my comfort zone is up leveling, which is what you wanna do, It's going to be uncomfortable. That's why we're out of the comfort zone, and we have to get out of our comfort zone. Yeah. And so often what I've seen in the work I've done with my clients is that they'll do really good and things start happening. And one of 2 things will happen either they will start making decisions which will put them back into their old comfort zone of what they're used to, or they're in their comfort zone and they don't wanna change the mindset and the behaviors that require you to go from this this place to the next place because it will require change. And so whenever I'm going through one of those up leveling, now I've just kinda learned to recognize it. It's like, okay. Wait a second. I'm just in this comfort zone. I need to get to the next comfort zone. So let me clear anything that might be in my way. First of all, any beliefs? What am I telling myself? What's that self taught? me clear all clear all that.

Liz Stapleton [00:13:44]:
-- your success because I feel like your failures talked a lot about, but not fear of success, which

Jennifer Dawn [00:13:49]:
your fear of success is huge. Yeah. So I'm afraid of success, whatever that happens to be, if I need to journal it out, okay, I'm gonna journal it out, I'm gonna get that stuff cleared, and then I'm gonna start asking like, well, what's it gonna take for me to get to the next level? And when I start getting that in that information of, well, you need to do this. You need to do this, which is gonna require me to think differently and behave a little differently, then I just gradually kind of ease myself into it and start just up leveling, up leveling, and now I might be a little uncomfortable. but in my own mind, I'll just think of it sounds kinda weird, but I think of a grid filling in. And so like, it's like, hey, wait. I've decided in my grid that I wanna go up here, and so I'm gonna think differently, behave differently, become the person that I need to be to be up here. Mhmm. And then I need to let that grid kind of fill in. And it's sort of just like a feeling. I don't know how to explain it, but -- No. No. You're great

Liz Stapleton [00:14:43]:
because I it's, like, I've started recognizing it as well where I'm like, okay. It's something I don't wanna do.

Jennifer Dawn [00:14:50]:
Yeah.

Liz Stapleton [00:14:50]:
It's probably something I need to do. gonna make me uncomfortable. It's gonna push me forward. And I had that when I was putting together the summit where I was like, these are my dream speakers. And I was like, that's a dream. But I was like, no. You to pitch them because you're scared. The the fact that you -- Right. -- for half a second were like, I don't want to means you absolutely have to. And and I did. I pitched all of them, and I some nos, right, but I also got some yeses, which totally I was like, you know, like, I'm so thrilled that the speakers who've gotten to the summit yourself included, and I'm, like, so glad that even when I was, like, in doubt, I pushed through when I pitched it anyway because --

Jennifer Dawn [00:15:25]:
That's right.

Liz Stapleton [00:15:26]:
That's right. You know, it's it's created something that I'm, like, super excited about.

Jennifer Dawn [00:15:30]:
Right. But you had to be willing to think about it a little differently. Like, you know what? I'm not gonna let this stop me, and then you had to take You had to just go pitch them anyway. You had to be willing to get the nos to get to the yeses. Yeah. And that's how we up level. And it is a little comfortable and fear will pop up. And I I like you, I'm just like, anytime I'm afraid of something, I'm always like, wait a second. Am I afraid of this because it's gonna really help me get to where I wanna be, or am I feeling nervous on this? -- hard. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Exactly.

Liz Stapleton [00:16:01]:
Or and sometimes I'm like, am

Jennifer Dawn [00:16:02]:
I feeling fear around this because it's not the right direction? So I will definitely

Liz Stapleton [00:16:07]:
-- You know, you're like, you know what? No. I don't wanna go that way, but, you know, in that case, it was a I'm scared they'll say no. I'm like, well, then they say no, but what -- Right. Exactly. Yes. Right?

Jennifer Dawn [00:16:16]:
Like, it definitely, like, I have to go for it. Yeah.

Liz Stapleton [00:16:18]:
It's like, if the worst thing happened is they say no and maybe block my email if I'm really that annoying.

Jennifer Dawn [00:16:24]:
Like -- Right. Right. Exactly.

Liz Stapleton [00:16:26]:
Keep pitching. Keep following up until you actually get to know.

Jennifer Dawn [00:16:29]:
Yeah. Exactly. Exactly. I think you have to put it out there. And, you know, especially with writing, you know, you're Sometimes you're pouring your your thoughts, your opinions, your heart, your soul out there for the world. And, you know, the world may not always agree and may not like it and you might get a little criticism. You might get some pushback and, you know, to me, I'm like, if people are taking the time to complain, it means that I somehow got their attention. Yes. Right? And in this whole

Liz Stapleton [00:16:59]:
-- Like, if you get, like, a hater comment, or that means you've made it. That means, like, you have engaged people enough that they care enough to say something even if they don't agree with you,

Jennifer Dawn [00:17:10]:
I

Liz Stapleton [00:16:28]:
wanted someone subscribed to my email list just so they could get my email to send me a 800 word email about how much they disagreed with the post I wrote. Oh. And I was like, well, you cannot subscribe. And I was like, yes. Like, you cared that much. So so be glad for the haters too. That's right. But, again, you

Jennifer Dawn [00:17:29]:
know what? That's a mindset shift where you're just like, hey. They're hating me. I'm I'm getting on some radars, I must be doing something right. Yeah. Yeah. And if they're copying you too, that you must be doing something right. I've seen that before where I'll see some of my stuff out there and I'm like, hey, but then it's like, wait a second. if they if they're resonating with it, if they like what you're doing enough, you're just gonna have people kind of

Liz Stapleton [00:17:52]:
I mean, there's a fine line there. Go watch the legal sessions having to do with this summit we've got. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. For sure. There's a there's a where they, you know, there's there's the popping you where they reference you and they're like, this person's amazing, and I wanna be like, and then there's, like, straight up copying.

Jennifer Dawn [00:18:08]:
Straight up copy.

Liz Stapleton [00:18:07]:
That is, like, not okay. And that there's things you can do to protect your intellectual property, all that stuff. So -- Right. You know, there's some flattery, but there's some also, like, no, not cool.

Jennifer Dawn [00:18:20]:
So -- Yeah. Exactly. Yeah. But again, it's all depending on when you look at it and how you handle it. And so I love that you mentioned you know, look at the legal stuff, look at how to protect yourself. Again, it's all mindset stuff. It's like not being a victim to it. If it happens, hopefully, it won't. and just be being willing to protect yourself. Feel being willing to take those steps. So I love that.

Liz Stapleton [00:18:41]:
Yeah. Yeah. so I love your journaling suggestion in terms of breaking through those barriers. do you have any kind of exercises or suggestions of how does sort of recognize what those fears are where, you know, like, yes, you can get a journal and you're like, I'm, you know, you can always be like, I'm just, I don't know what to write. I struggle. I never come up with good ideas, but usually there's a deeper level that you have to get to to really bust out of that that it's it's more than just writers block.

Jennifer Dawn [00:19:12]:
Yeah.

Liz Stapleton [00:19:12]:
Yeah. You know, the it is a fear of something.

Jennifer Dawn [00:19:15]:
Right.

Liz Stapleton [00:19:15]:
How do you work into recognizing specifically what those fears are?

Jennifer Dawn [00:19:19]:
Yeah. Great question. And so the first thing that I would say is, 1, you have to set your intention. You have to want to know what those peers are. And I say that because so many of us will distract ourselves from really knowing and understanding what's going on. So it might scare us to get in there. It might scare us to feel what we're really feeling. And so we'll just kind of numb and dumb ourselves down. Right? We check out. We go and watch a bunch of TV. We get lost in social media. we might drink. We might do things like that that are kind of like numbing it all down and because we're not really willing to look at it. And so the first thing that I would say is, 1, set your intention to really want to get in there, want to know what's happening, be brave. I promise nobody ever died from an emotion. They didn't. and you'll find that once you get in there and you start to actually feel this stop and acknowledge its existence, it will go away on its own. instead of, you know, bearing it, repressing it, and it's still kind of staying stuck to you. Yeah. But if you acknowledge it, it's gonna actually go away on its own. It's gonna feel really good because often our emotions are telling us something. It's usually some sort of information. you're afraid of something. Well, why? Like, get in there. Why am I afraid of this? Well, maybe because you know, I failed at it before. Okay. Well, what am I doing differently this time to make sure I don't fail again? And so you can kind of work through that. But, you know, with the journaling is so powerful because I've noticed that the more I do it, the deeper I go. But if I'm setting my intention to kinda get in there and figure it out. That's sort of the first step is being willing to look at it. stop choosing to be unaware of what's going on. Okay. And then the journaling exercise is just really, really crucial to just just start free flowing it out. Sometimes I'm, like, sitting there writing and it's just like, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, because it'll just sort of break open. And I'm like, that's what's going on. And I I really need to just sit and think about it all day. Wouldn't necessarily be of allowed me to break it open the way that sometimes just I don't know, pen to paper. It just will kind of really just sort of break that down, but, like, you can't do it once and be like, oh, my problems are solved. Like, it doesn't work that way.

Liz Stapleton [00:21:34]:
Like, it's -- -- rise. Like, new levels, new problems.

Jennifer Dawn [00:18:19]:
Yeah. It's kind of like a daily thing that you just sort of bring into your day the same way you might bring in meditation or visualization, bring in a little bit of journaling. You just sort of bring that into your day with the intention of clearing it, getting rid of it, understanding it, learning from it and using it to propel you forward.

Liz Stapleton [00:21:57]:
Yeah. Yeah. No. I I I like that a lot because I found, like, fear failure doesn't seem to bother me because I fail all the time. I've gotten really good at failing, you know, like, like, throughout my life. you know, but what I've learned you know, in the last couple of years, I actually did have a fear of success because I would go go go be really close to our own to be and then be like, I'm gonna go work on something else now. you know, and just, like, feel like, well, so close. You know?

Jennifer Dawn [00:22:24]:
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

Liz Stapleton [00:22:24]:
And, you know, so I think it is something that, you know, you really do have to decide you wanna focus and recognize regardless of what you're gonna find.

Jennifer Dawn [00:22:32]:
Yep. Yep. Absolutely.

Liz Stapleton [00:22:33]:
Yeah. And if there's a fear of what you'll find.

Jennifer Dawn [00:22:35]:
Sure. Often that fear of success and it's very valid, very legitimate. I think most people have a fear of success and failure, but with the fear of success also is tied to that fear of change.

Liz Stapleton [00:22:45]:
Yeah.

Jennifer Dawn [00:22:46]:
Because when you're more successful, your life will change. Your circumstances will change, and it's kind of the unknown because you're you know what today is, what your life is, Yep. If you start to become more successful, it's the unknown. Like, it's not a road you've been on. So it's that fear of change and what if I don't like it and all of that stuff starts to get kinda tied together.

Liz Stapleton [00:21:55]:
Yeah. And you say it, you know, like, going into the unknown, I'm like, there's that frozen two song. And I

Jennifer Dawn [00:23:14]:
Yes. Yeah. Okay.

Liz Stapleton [00:23:11]:
So we've we've talked about kind of feeling stuck in the forward momentum and, and kind of that breaking through the barriers to uplevel, but how do you how and you touched on journaling for overwhelm, but how do you kind of tackle that? Because once you get it all out, I feel like sometimes in that instance, I wouldn't wanna tear it up because I need to reference it, like, all the things I wanted to do with a plan. So, like -- Yeah.

Jennifer Dawn [00:23:35]:
Yeah. Exactly. And actually in my journal, I have space where the pages they're designed to be torn out, but I have pages in the front or for the stuff I wanna keep. Because as I'm journaling, sometimes there are thoughts or or whatever ideas that I'm like, oh, I need to hold on to that. So I will write that down in a separate space and keep that. And and that way I can still rip up and throw away the rest. But with overwhelm, whether you're starting out, you're up leveling or you're you're up leveled and you're just like, oh my god, this feels like drinking from the fire hose. wherever you happen to be, one of my favorite exercises to do to combat combat overwhelm is, a brain dump, which is nothing new. Okay. But this part 2, that's, like, that's the good part. So the first thing that you wanna do is just look at everything that you've got going on. When overwhelmed is kinda like not knowing what to do next because or feeling like, you know, whatever I do, I'm gonna be disappointing somebody like, and you just kinda get frozen. And so -- Yeah.

Liz Stapleton [00:24:31]:
--

Jennifer Dawn [00:24:31]:
some people, when they're just super overwhelmed, will just start doing whatever, just to cross things off the list, some people will just completely check out and just be like, I have no idea. So I'm gonna go over here and watch Netflix like whatever. So whatever you are in that What I recommend is that you first brain dump it out. So personal and professional, everything that's going on, just write it all down on a big massive list. but you cannot stop there, or you just have a big overwhelming massive list. Yeah. But at least you're getting it out of your head and you're getting it onto paper

Liz Stapleton [00:25:00]:
Because then you're not trying to, like, think compartmentalize and remember all the things and then something inevitably gets forgotten, and it's just yeah.

Jennifer Dawn [00:25:08]:
Right. Exactly. But, I mean, personal and professional, like, I put it on there, all my obligations down to the last little minute detail, everything that I'm kind of like feeling like, oh my gosh. I have all this stuff to do. then I go through and I a, b, c, d, e it. So an a is gonna be something that I do that will actually push me forward And it might be one of those tasks like going and pitching speakers for your blogging summit. Okay? Yeah. That's an a. It might scare you. You might you'll wanna procrastinate it totally, but you know in your heart, that will get you closer to where you wanna be. Right? So that's an a. and everything can't be an a. Usually won't, but usually it's kind of like, oh, it's something I know I should be doing, but I'm kind of procrastinating there's some fear around it, but Those are my a's. Yeah. B's are gonna be the important things we all have to do. You know, vendor meetings, client meetings, whatever we have to do. Those are the b's. They're important. C's, we can delegate until later. So they're really not that important. And if you've ever been in a state of overwhelm or maybe just how you run your day to day, if you're a list person and you like to make a list and cross things off, right? Sometimes you'll find yourself doing a lot of C tasks. They're not really that important. but they're easy to cross off a list. And so when I really started diving into my productivity, I started looking at all my lists and going, oh, there was not an A on that list. The b's were done, and I got a bunch of c's done so I could cross them off. And I'm like, uh-uh, that's not gonna work. And so I flipped it, right? Because scenes can be procrastinated. So when you look at this massive brain dump, These things can wait, and so those are all your c's. D's are delegate. Who can we assign, get some help around, you know, whatever the delegation is, and e is eliminate. And eliminate could be forever or it could be not right now. So it might be like, you know what? I'm gonna move this to next quarter. I'm gonna move this to next year. or I'm just gonna eliminate it from the list right now because it's not a high priority and it's not really moving me to where I wanna be. So now once you've got this massive list, ABCDE, you kind of have a tangible, like, oh, okay. So now every day, try and knock out 1 or 2 A's. Mhmm. Get your b's done. C's as you're able. Everything that you're delegating. Make sure you're coming back and checking sure, you know, whenever you get that stuff done. And if you can clear some of that stuff off and eliminate it or move it later, that's gonna open up some space. So it's a simple exercise, but if you're really overwhelmed, like, getting it all down, creating a a kind of a map around it and a strategy can be so effective. And you might have to do this, like, every day for a few days until you start feeling like, okay, I'm really caught up. I've got

Liz Stapleton [00:27:44]:
feelings around it. Yeah. Like, in my head, I'm like, uh-huh. Uh-huh. Yeah. I need to I need to break down, and I need to go through this.

Jennifer Dawn [00:27:44]:
Yes. Exactly. And, you know, it might take half hour. It might take an hour, but If it gets all your productivity going back in the right direction, it's worth the time. Just put your ass in the chair and do it. And now It's like, oh, okay. I can do this. I'm and you you don't need to knock out 12 A's in a day. Knock out 1 a a day, you know, one big thing gonna move you forward, your b's, and your c's as you're able until you start feeling more caught up.

Liz Stapleton [00:28:17]:
Yeah. No. I think, yeah, that's just Yeah. Not really. I need to do try this. I'll I really like that ABCDE just -- --

Jennifer Dawn [00:28:28]:
thousands of people. Every person I've ever worked with, and I'm like, I'm overwhelmed. It's like, okay. Do this. And if you do it, it will work. and it does. And people are like, oh my gosh. That just oh, oh, freed me up so much.

Liz Stapleton [00:28:16]:
And -- -- the perspective shift of how you're looking at the things you're doing, and it and it's a very clear way to do it. I I never liked that. yeah. So okay. So we I'm trying to look at what else we had to talk about. Oh, one thing, because you did touch on this. I'd love to dive just a little bit deeper -- Mhmm. -- is the comparison game. Oh, that's to stop. You have to stop Well, yeah, but it's it's hard. Especially in blogging, especially if you know you started around the same time as someone. Maybe you both got the say, of course, and you're like, okay. We started this course around the same time, and they just take off. And you're like, but, yeah, what am I doing? You know, so, like, how do you deal with that? How do you kind of because I think comparing in some ways can be good because it can help you be like, hey. What are they doing that I'm not that can help me? You know, it can give you ideas, but it can also, like, put you in such a negative place.

Jennifer Dawn [00:29:32]:
Yeah.

Liz Stapleton [00:29:32]:
Yeah. I can. You know, advice or tips on dealing with that.

Jennifer Dawn [00:29:30]:
Yeah. I love this. And so it's funny because I had gotten, a book. It's I haven't it's on my bookshelf with some. It's Brendan Bouchard. Okay. Brendan Bouchard is ridiculous, and he huge. And he's like, you know, helped a billion people or whatever the number is. And I got his book about the the productivity habits or whatever. I was like, man, he's doing so many good things in this world. Let me read this book. So I opened the book and I start reading it, and it's all about all his accomplishments. And I was like, oh, I just started shrinking, and I just started feeling so bad about my self. And I was like, I can't read this book. I was like, this book is making me feel terrible about myself because that's what I was doing. I was comparing myself to where I

Liz Stapleton [00:30:18]:
have -- Like, every time you read the blog income reports.

Jennifer Dawn [00:30:18]:
Yeah. Exactly. And you're just like, oh my god. And I still haven't read I'm gonna read it one day, but I'm sure there's some great information in there. Sorry, Brendan. I'm sure it's wonderful. but I couldn't get through it because, it really the way that it was written or something, it just really made me feel bad about myself and didn't feel inspiring like, hey, I did this and you can get here too. And maybe that was chapter too. I don't know. I didn't get that far. Yeah. But, it was, again, it's that comparison where I started to compare myself. And so this can happen to any of us. Mhmm. And so, really, the first thing I would suggest is that you whatever it is that you're eating or doing or whatever step away from it. Just get a little bit of perspective. It's really okay. If you feel yourself like going down that hole and you're just really feeling bad and now you're starting to feel bad about yourself and you're starting to internalize it. Of course, you could journal about it, but I want you to get a little bit of distance from it because every person who's accomplished anything and they built this community and their blogs are taking off or whatever, they all started from nothing to. They did. Like, nobody started with a super successful blog. Like, they all had to start a ground 0 and write their first one and, you know, they all had to start in the same place. Yeah. And so you can absolutely do absolutely do that too. But, again, if you're in that mindset of, oh, you know, I'm not as good as him or whatever, you know, it will never happen. So distance yourself, give yourself a little space from it because you are uniquely you. And I think you have to own you and what you're gonna provide because you're gonna say it in your way. You're gonna do it in your way. and the people who are gonna follow you will follow you, but they're not gonna follow you if you're kinda caught up in all of this, like, trying to be somebody else.

Liz Stapleton [00:32:13]:
You know? Yeah. I've done where, like, I've stopped following or blocked, like, people on social, like, other bloggers on social, not because, like, I didn't like them, but because somehow what they were doing made me feel like, you know, kinda shrunk me, like, maybe in you. And I was like, It's not on them. Like, they're not doing this. It's my feelings. Right? But I just need to step away and not see what they're doing for a while. Right. Exactly. Who knows of them for all their success. Like, great job. I need to, like, not follow you because it's just making me struggle in ways that I don't need to.

Jennifer Dawn [00:32:11]:
Exactly. And if it's kill in your mindset, like, it's not worth it. And then another great way to flip it is to send that person love and blessings and goodwill and congratulations and gratitude because they've actually shown that you could do it. Like, if they can do it, you can do it. They've shown that there's an audience for whatever the topic might be, like, oh, people do care about this. And so if you can start to shift it with some gratitude and even just love them, bless them, be happy for them. And sometimes it's hard. Yeah. But, like, you know, just think about it for a little while. and and that will help you shift into your own space. Yep. And then you can focus on building what you love and what you want. and bringing those people that will really appreciate what you have to say and focus on that instead of, you know, the comparison game.

Liz Stapleton [00:33:37]:
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. and it's okay to, like, step back and turn off social or turn or stop following them. You know? Like, If they're they're in a place where you wanna be, like, them having one less follower is not gonna, like, make or break them. Like, you know? No. And it's okay because you can always later go call them again when you're like, hey. I'm, you know --

Jennifer Dawn [00:33:57]:
Right.

Liz Stapleton [00:33:57]:
-- and that's fine. You know? It's -- Right. It's okay. And if someone actually says something to you because maybe you do have some sort of personal relationship be like, hey. Kudos to you on all your success. I just need to step back so I could focus on my own stuff, and I wanted to follow less people for right now. Like, absolutely. It's don't apologize. You don't need to apologize for doing things like that. You just need to tell them why if you want, although you don't owe them an explanation either.

Jennifer Dawn [00:33:35]:
That's right. That's right. I mean, I have a a daily planner. Like, I don't know if anybody shops for one lately, but there's about a million options these days, and so many people have their own planners. And the competition is really, really fierce. And if I let that stop me, I would never have probably released it, but I built my own community one person at a time. And I'm just like, you know, for the people that this is a good fit for, it's a good fit for. but, like, I've gotten caught into that trap of looking, Brendan Bouchard has a planner. You know, everybody has a planner, and I might, like, go and peek and see a little bit but I don't wanna I also don't want a copy. I wanna do what I feel inspired to do.

Liz Stapleton [00:34:58]:
I feel inspired to do.

Jennifer Dawn [00:34:59]:
So I might go look a little bit, but then I just cut it off. And I'm like, God love them. God bless them. Whatever. I'm like, let them go do what they need to do. And I really hope they're successful, and they help Stapleton, and I'm gonna be over here, and I'm gonna do what I need to do, let me be successful, and let me help people too. because because

Liz Stapleton [00:35:16]:
and also just try to help people out there that use multiple planners. So they might use yours and Brendan's, and, you know, because they have different things going on. because it's for them keeping that that much organized, but, you know, there are people that have, like, you use the 5 different plan or the like.

Jennifer Dawn [00:35:31]:
Oh, I know.

Liz Stapleton [00:35:32]:
I I can't do that, but great. If that works for you, if that's how your brain works. Awesome. Yeah. Exactly. Yeah. Yeah. So Okay. was there anything we hadn't touched on that you wanted to make sure we covered?

Jennifer Dawn [00:35:45]:
you know, the only other final thought about overwhelm, I'm gonna swing back here. Yeah. Oh, overwhelm is also a belief. And when we talk about your core belief system of who you are and what you believe, if you believe that, you know, a busy blogger is overwhelmed, then that's what you're gonna be. And so just spend a few minutes really thinking about, like, what belief do I have around overwhelm? And if you don't wanna be overwhelmed anymore, you can change that belief system. You can do the brain dump. You can get yourself organized and you can commit to not gonna work in an overwhelmed state. And anytime you start to feel it, now you have a tool, you know, what to do to to study Yeah. And you can change your belief system and just commit to a different way of working. and that can be really, really powerful.

Liz Stapleton [00:34:58]:
Oh, yeah. I because I especially with blogging, is there's always more you could do? Like, 100%. You could work all the time. But but that's not good in for most people, not for me. It's not good for me to, like, never hang out with friends or family. or whatever, you know, because I'm constantly working. And so setting boundaries and me like, nope. I'm gonna be done at this time, or I'm only doing, you know, I'm taking a day off where I don't even cracked my laptop open.

Jennifer Dawn [00:36:58]:
Exactly.

Liz Stapleton [00:36:57]:
You know, because I just need that break, but for my mental sanity. You know, so don't feel bad about that. if that means the post is a day late or you have to backdate the republish or whatever, you know, maybe you just maybe instead of writing new posts, you've republish an old one that you update 10 minutes. Right. If that's okay. Right. Right. And you make such

Jennifer Dawn [00:37:19]:
a great comment about, like, don't feel bad about that. Sometimes it's hard not to feel bad about like, you're like, oh, I'm not if I'm not at my desk, then, I'm not gonna be as successful. Again, bad belief, limiting belief, clear that out. Like, replace it with, I can work a reasonable day and still have a whole life and still be successful. So it all kinda ties there. And in the in the beginning, if you cut off work and you're like, oh, I feel guilty. It will be uncomfortable. Right? because you're out of your comfort zone. but you just have to realign with, wait, what do I firm? What do I want? I I don't wanna work a 12 hour day. I wanna work a reasonable day and see my family at night and just kind of reaffirm that. Even if it feels a little uncomfortable at the beginning, if it's getting you closer to where you wanna be, even if it's a little uncomfortable, do it. Just, yeah, just push through that.

Liz Stapleton [00:38:09]:
