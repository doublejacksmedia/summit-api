[00:00:00.000] - Liz Stapleton, Host
All right, guys. I'm really excited for this session with Lanie, from lanielammare.com. Lanie, thank you so much for being here. I really appreciate it.

[00:00:06.420] - Lanie Lammare
I appreciate you having me.

[00:00:08.330] - Liz 
Yeah, because I'm excited for your session because I know you're a big Airtable fan, as am I. Airtable and ClickUp are my two go-twos. So can you tell us a little bit about your background and what you're going to be teaching us today?

[00:00:22.250] - Lanie
I think it's really kind that you call us Airtable fans because really, we're nerds. Anyone who sort of loves a spreadsheet just sees a spreadsheet and falls in love with it has to fall in the nerd category. However, you don't have to be a nerd to appreciate it. In fact, I think that Airtable is really well suited to people who are creative thinkers because you tend to start to plan in a way where you just keep adding things to your to-do list, and you don't make them accountable to the goals that you set for yourself, or the vision that you have for yourself, and if you use Airtable in the way that I teach it, it can help you really start to think and plan, and add on to your to-do list things that will actually get you ahead. So if you're creating content, create content that's going to either grow your list or make you sales. Every time you hit publish, that's the goal of your content, right? Not the brilliant idea, not the thing that you really have to share with everybody, but when you're in business it's about aligning those things to each other so I use Airtable in that way, and that's how I'm teaching it in our tutorial today.

[00:01:28.310] - Liz
Yeah. Before everyone stresses out, Airtable is free.

[00:01:31.040] - Lanie
Oh yeah.

[00:01:31.230] - Liz
If you're not familiar with it and you're like, Oh my God, I'm just going to be told to go buy another product, especially in the blogging niche I feel like it's spend the cash. And yes, there are great resources like the "All Acces Pass" is a great investment you know and there's a side to investing and getting a return on that investment but Airtable is an amazing tool that's free.

[00:01:52.100] - Lanie
Yeah, and I approached it with that thought too, right? The idea that we're using the free version. And if you want to upgrade, like if you start nerding out hard and you decide that you're really into all the extra bells and whistles, cool beans, go for it. But absolutely, yes, start with the free stuff so that you can even see if it resonates with you.

[00:02:12.860] - Liz
Yeah, exactly. Which is why Airtable, they're my go-to. It just blows my mind that they're free. So let's go ahead and dive in. I'm excited about this because I know not all my content accomplishes this goal of getting them on my list or buying products so I'm excited to see what you have to say, so let's go to it.

[00:02:32.270] - Lanie
This "Content Creation and Calendar Airtable Base" is like the one repository to rule them all. We've got here, just as a quick look at the tables, we have "Content Creation" (things you're actively working on), "Content Library" (everything you've already published), "As Featured In" (other people's stuff that you were published on), and "Offers" (this is going to be whether those are paid or freebies), and you're going to see how all of this ties in together but it's really all of your creation stuff under one roof. And it all starts with this table here: "Your Messaging." There are only two fields for you to fill in here. There's going to be the messaging field and your philosophy. All of the other ones you can see are linked to your other tables and I'll talk about that in just one second, but I do want to talk about your messaging.

[00:03:15.550] - Lanie
Every great brand has some messaging, philosophies, beliefs that they promote, usually about two to five of them. I want you to go ahead and list whatever it is that your message, that your brand is trying to communicate. What kind of beliefs and philosophies keep it such that you are on brand? Then you can go ahead and build out your philosophy here. If you want a little bit more information about things related to brand stories and connecting with customers through the way you communicate, this book has been hands down one of my personal favorites. It's called: "Building a Story Brand: Clarify your message so customers will listen." This is just the little book synopsis from Amazon. But this one definitely delivers when it comes to speaking about your business and who you are and what you do. Highly recommend!

[00:03:59.480] - Lanie
Now, as far as these fields being connected to those other tables, you kind of get a pulled-back view on the content you've been creating. Where does it all fall, which messages does it fall under, is one message getting more attention than the other, are you not promoting a specific message enough? This table will deliver all that information at a bird's-eye view because all of your content is connected to those messages.

[00:04:20.490] - Lanie
Let's go and see how that works by starting with the  "Content Creation Table". So here are your "Content Titles". Let's say we have a genius idea. We're going to go ahead and work through this "Genius idea number 785". And the "Content-Type"? Maybe we want to create a blog post, YouTube, newsletter, podcast, free resources. It's completely up to you and will depend on the type of content that you generally do create. But let's say this is a genius idea I have for my podcast.

[00:04:49.230] - Lanie
So what's the purpose of creating content? It's to reinforce your message. Okay, but why do you want to reinforce your message? Well, it's because this is what your business is built on. So the end goal is always to collect on one of two things: people's contact information so that you can further educate them about what you're all about, or to offer them a paid product that will help them with whatever it is they came to your content for in the first place. So I like to be able to include a lead magnet, an opt-in, a resource that is like a supporting document to whatever it is that you created. So you can go ahead and add this content "Genius idea 785" will relate to freebie number two. You'll find those in the offers area, but we'll see those in a second and it reinforces message-two from that first table that we were looking at.

[00:05:34.660] - Lanie
I love how it forces you to acknowledge whether your content is actually on brand to your messaging because you can have a great idea that isn't at all related to your business, and then you waste a lot of time creating really great content that again, isn't really aligned with what your big message is. I like that this is sort of a check or reaffirmation that, yes, this is A-okay to be bringing into your world.

[00:05:57.020] - Lanie
Now, is this scheduled, published content, is this a work in progress, is this something that I'm currently recording, or is this just an idea? We're going to go with idea. When you're creating content, it might not be all about you. You might have a team working on this, in which case the people with whom you've shared the board, they will be identified as collaborators. I've done it in other videos where I have a separate table for "Contacts", but you can also do it in this way as well. You can see the cute little faces of the people with whom you're working. Let's go scroll down a little bit here. So you have the publishing date, the date that content should be going out into the world, created by, when do you need it written by, when do you need it done, because if you're batching your content creation it's great to be able to have future publishing dates and have a bunch of stuff created by a specific date.

[00:06:41.590] - Lanie
Since there are stages to content creation, I've gone ahead and created check marks. So has it been created, has it been edited, have the graphics been created? Here is a "attachment field" where you can save those graphics, and has it been scheduled? If you're working from a Google Doc, you can go ahead and put the link in there so that everyone who is actively working on it has the direct link to that content.

[00:07:06.350] - Lanie
I'm going to go back to the beginning of this table here. What I like to do is I like to group this by "Content-Type". This way you can easily see your blog posts, your YouTube stuff, your newsletter stuff. It kind of divides it in a better way. If you wanted to create this as its own view, you would go ahead and add view: "Grid". We're going to add this as "Content-Type View", and we're going to group that. Let's go ahead and create another grid view, and we're going to create a grid view based on the "Status" and this way, we'll be able to see what's an idea, what are we actually working on, what hasn't been attributed a status yet.

[00:07:49.220] - Lanie
On to "Content Library". You'll notice these first few columns, these first few fields look the same. That's been done on purpose so that when you have something like this one that has already been scheduled, you can just go ahead and copy those first three lines, "Copy". Then go back over here and we'll paste it and it will show up exactly the same as it was and then you can add your publishing date and you can [singing 00:08:14] get the URL to where that content was published, your graphics and so on and so forth. So that way you can have a working library. You can maybe even see, oh man, I've got a bunch of content promoting message-one, but nothing with message-two or even freebie-two. You're better equipped to balance out the content that you're creating. So let's go ahead and group this by, "reinforces the message". And so we would see here that there's a count of two for message-one. If we had a bunch of content and we would see that we have 20 pieces of content for message-one, but only five for message- two, you can sort of see how that needs to be a bit more balanced.

[00:08:47.850] - Lanie
Let's go back to that "Content Creation". You would be able to then go ahead and right-click and delete record. So once something has been scheduled or published, it doesn't have to be in the work in progress anymore. I'm going to go back here since we're already back in this "Content Creation". I've got to show you the other views that we've got. So your calendar - you can see how your content is slid over your month. You might want to move things around so that it's a little bit more balanced as to when your publishing dates are. And then your "Gallery View". If you wanted to look at them as individual cards this way, and you can also look at it in a "Kanban View" that would group it by "Content-Type" or "Status". Let's go ahead with "Content-Type". You can see it by "Content-Type" and you can change that here and then go to "Status" and see the status once here. You can start to see how useful the different views are. "Content Library Views" is much the same. We have the "Calendar" (when things were published), "Gallery View with Cards", and we're going to go to the "Kanban View" (where it divides it into blog posts and YouTube videos, et cetera). "As Featured In", I'm willing to bet that you could have guessed that this looks much the same as the others.

[00:09:54.330] - Lanie
Something I didn't mention in the other videos, especially for the "Content Library" in this one, is that having that URL here, that link to directly to a specific piece of content can be really handy instead of having to go back to your website and copy and pasting the link and forwarding it to someone. Everything is just at your fingertips right here. And finally your offers. Your offers are content, whether they are free or paid resources. And I really do recommend that you create a library for these, for multiple reasons. One, you can always relate these offers back to the content you're creating. You can always see how it's all enmeshed together, how it all works as one cohesive entity. And I don't know about you, but good Lord do I hate searching for links for everything. So for freebie-one, we see we have the opt-in page link, so the actual sales page, if you will, where people would land to sign up for that specific offer. The codes to embed into your post, whether that's a pop-up or sign-up form, whatever it is that you embed into a post to promote that freebie, keep that handy. And, also direct links to that actual resource. Sometimes I want to look over my own freebie content, but then I have to go into my email marketing and then download the link from there, that's crazy! Just keep it all in one spot and this is the perfect spot to do it. Now, samesies goes for your paid offers. You would have a link to your sales page. You would have some details about what those paid offers are: cost, duration of service, how many are available, when they become available, details about payment schedules, and things of that nature.

[00:11:19.750] - Lanie
You'll see as we go down here, some images that promote the freebies, the offers, and the content that relates to those offers. So let's say you have content related to a specific paid offer, you would be able to recycle some of that content or maybe just get an active inventory of what you already have out there that's related to that offer. But you see how this web all ties right back into that first one that we were on where your related content that's: work in progress, your offers, your featured content, and the content you've already created all relate back to your big brand message. So that's your "Content Creation and Calendar Airtable Base."

[00:11:57.920] - Lanie
There are approximately one gazillion ways to plan a quarter but with my way, with the Airtable method that I'm going to show you, you're not just planning your quarter. You are creating goals that you will constantly be accountable to, that you will not be able to ignore if you're doing work or taking on tasks that are not directly related to accomplishing the things that you set out to accomplish. This is less about the "to-do list"  and way more about the "to-be list". What are you trying to become? What are you trying to create? And always, always keeping your eye on that prize.

[00:12:28.890] - Lanie
So where are we going to start with? We're going to start in the "Start Here Column." [laughs]. Before we get started, let's explain a couple of things. These rows that you would normally call a row, these are called fields with Airtable. And if you click down here, you can customize the field type. And you'll see here that this little icon indicates that it's a drop-down menu. This is what the type of field this is that we're dealing with. And I've already populated this with "Create New Program", "Create A Challenge" to promote the program, "Run an Ad Campaign" to the challenge, and "Pre-sell" the program. These are the things, the focuses that I want this quarter to be focused on. So if you want to change anything, you could pre-sell the wholly heck out of the program, and if you wanted to add something you would just go ahead and do that enter button. Hit it hard! See how easy it is to edit, remove. If you wanted to switch places for things, that's pretty easy to do as well. You have colored options, but you can also just do grayscale. So that's a quick view on how you can manage these options that you've got in front of you here.

[00:13:27.220] - Lanie
Let's go ahead and get started and select that first one. We want to create a new program that's part of our quarterly goals, it's part of our quarterly plans. I want you to list out all of the sort of modular ways of thinking about creating a new program. Like if you were to write a table of contents or create a course on creating a new program, what would the chapters of these be? That's what I want you to be writing in this area. So for instance, creating a new program, what would you have to do? You'd have to outline the program and you'd have to create the dang thing. So those are the kind of big-picture things that we would do. Please note that this works a lot like an Excel sheet with that little triangle in the corner. You could go ahead and drag and drop it so you don't have to type the same thing over and over again. So let's say that's everything that will go into creating a new program.

[00:14:10.800] - Lanie
Let's go ahead and write everything that's going to go into creating the challenge to promote the new program. So the first thing is we're going to have to map out the challenge; we're going to write the daily emails to support the challenge, and we're going to create the worksheets for the daily emails. So you kind of get the idea of how this works. You would do that for each and every one of the big goals that you were going after, and then the big-picture things that have to happen in order for those things to become a reality. Now I'm not going to do all of these because the important thing here is to have the example to see how this works. So let's keep rolling over into the other fields. This one here you'll see is a multiple drop-down field, which means that you can select more than one option. Here you could only select one, but now you can select a couple of them. This field might not be of interest to you. That's totally up to you, but I left it there in case it is. I like it because it allows me to see how I'm dividing my time. Here we're looking at creating a new program is obviously offers, but other things include… Well, in this case, it would be marketing and promotions as well as offers for a new challenge. But see, if you're spending so much time creating offers over the course of a year, let's say, and you can see that by how you're dividing your time, your area of focus, and not as much time on, say, growth and bottom line, kind of a problem, right?

[00:15:29.900] - Lanie
So it's a good way of being accountable to how you're spending your time and energy. What are you focusing on? Like I said, I like it, but if you don't, you can hide it here, or you can hide it up here, or you can just delete it entirely. Totally your call. But something you're definitely going to want is a time frame. So i've already divided these month-one, month-two, month-three. You can specify January, February, March, whatever. But the idea here is to establish what time frame you're going to do these things. And you'll see how this is helpful in a minute. So outline the program, well, that's month-one, and create the dang program. Well, we're going to create it as we go. That's going to be a month-three thing. Mapping out the challenge, again month-one. Write the daily emails to support the challenge. That's going to be a month-two thing because the challenge is going down in month-two. And those worksheets, I'd like to have those done first, actually. So there you go.

[00:16:16.740] - Lanie
You're starting to see how things take shape, but let's give it a little bit more shape by sorting first to last. So let's apply that. Oh, that looks nice, doesn't it? And you could have sorted it up here, but let's group it in an even more comprehensive way. So let's go ahead and group that by "Time Frame". And you're starting to see, actually, let's delete this field because this empty field is just going to be in our way. Delete it. There we go. So we see how sexy this is starting to look. It's all coming together where you can really get a bird's-eye view and see your information in different ways.

[00:16:46.000] - Lanie
Let's see an even more different way by clicking that drop-down over here and selecting a different view. It's one of the best parts about Airtable is how many different views they have and here we're going to look at the "Kanban View". If this looks familiar, this little icon looks a little bit like the Trello icon, well, it's because the "Kanban View" is what Trello is based on. Kanban is a project management term that means looking at all of your resources and making sure that you're distributing them in a way as not to overload any one specific area. And that becomes pretty obvious when we're looking at it through our timeline here. We've got three things going on in month-one and just one in month-two, and month-three. Obviously, you would be able to just move things around. When you're in this view you can really see that you need to reallocate where you're giving your attention, super easy to do. And those changes will also be reflected in that "Grid View". Let's go back to the grid view. We weren't quite finished, and we'll roll out [singing 00:17:36] these other fields. So we've got "Notes". So this is long-form. You can write really long-form stuff. Long-form stuff forever and ever. And you can see if you expand this, it really does appear in a long-form way. You can also tag somebody who is also on this Airtable base. You can tag them in these "Notes" attachments. Well, that's pretty self-explanatory. You can drag and drop files in there, or you can just load it as an attachment like this from any of these types of areas. Let me go ahead and close that.

[00:18:04.300] - Lanie
Now here is where things get interesting. These fields are linked to these tables. So month-one, this one is linked; month-two, this one is linked; month-three, this one is linked. And you'll start to see as we create more records, these fields will start to fill out. So without further ado, let's just keep rolling through. The next table is the "Contacts Table". You can always use a collaborator function. I like having a contact table because when you get nice little looksy at everyone who's working on your team, and they will also have all of their tasks located here. So if I'm one of these people, I can just go ahead and log in to my own name to see what is due. That's the "Gallery View". But if you went to the "Grid View" you would see that it's divided like any grid. So we've got: Jane Doe, name, her zone of genius, email, attachment, contact information, so on and so forth. Let's keep going through to month-one.

[00:18:52.080] - Lanie
So before we get started, I want to draw your attention here to this "all records are filtered" bit. We'll talk about it in a minute. First, we're going to start at the...you guessed it. You guessed it because you're good-looking and you're smart! Start here. We're going to click on here what you're working towards. This should look familiar because these are the big-picture tasks that you set out in the first table. So we're going to load up all of the things that we said we wanted to do in month-one because [singing 00:19:15] we are month-one. So we've got all of our big-picture to-do's in month-one and now we're going to write every little detailed task that's going to go into seeing this big-picture thing through. What are we working towards? What are the tasks that we have to complete to see this big- picture thing through that will lead us to accomplishing our goals?  So in "outlining the program", let's say, we'll create a sales page. And for "map out the challenge" let's say we're going to detail five action items. Now, I'm only writing one thing here just for brevity's sake, but actually, why don't we do something with create worksheets for daily emails? So we'll do: create worksheet one, create worksheet day two, create worksheet for day three. You see, you would write out every single thing that would go into seeing these items through. Then you would give them a due date. So if you wanted to change the format for your dates, you would go into "customized field type." I have it listed in this manner. It's my preference because that way when you need to sort It, it will be in numerical order. So, let's go ahead and do 01-01 and 2020-01-15. So we've got some due dates in there.

[00:20:21.600] - Lanie
Let's keep scrolling down. So when something's done, you can check it off as done. You see it's green here and it's green here. The greens match. It's because our filter is for the done stuff. So as soon as you've done the worksheet for day one, you check it and boom, it's gone. So you're only having to see the things that are actually on your tasks, your actionable tasks. The things that have already been done won't be showing up, but you didn't have to delete them either, which I really like.

[00:20:44.910] - Lanie
Now, "Contact". This is linked back to your "Contact Table" here. So you're able to delegate this to Jane Doe, let's say and this one is, well, I'll take care of that one, the boss lady and then you'll have the InstaGenius will be working on the worksheets. And in fact, on the third day, we're going to have Jane Doe and the InstaGenius collaborating so that when you go back to the contacts area, you can see all the tasks that you have to do here, but you can also go into the grid view and see them in a nicer way here.

[00:21:13.460] - Lanie
We'll go back to that month-one and I'll show you how to set up specialized calendars as well. Let's just finish on seeing what else we have here. So this is also linked. Now, what is this linked to? We can see that it's linked to our "Tasks to complete".  So if you have a prerequisite to a task, let's say you can't start work on day two until you finish work on the day one sheet, you can put that there "Task descriptions and details" so you can write at length about this. Now I just expanded that field, but you can actually expand a whole record and see everything at a bird's-eye view and attachments and links once again.

[00:21:45.660] - Lanie
Let's look at the other views that we can see this under. So we have the "Calendar View". Again, we can see we have that filter on and we can shift our due dates around just by moving our tasks around here, or you could move them around up here as well. We also have a "Gallery View" that we can take advantage of for our tasks if you're kind of a post-it-note kind of person. And I want to point something out about these views. Now, if I wanted to create multiple calendar views, let's say I'm Jane Doe and I wanted to create a calendar view just for the tasks that are attributed to me, I could go ahead and create a calendar this way.

[00:22:16.770] - Lanie
So everybody on your team can go ahead and create a personalized calendar. So "Jane's Calendar" and you would filter it: add filter, contact, contains "Jane Doe". Voila, all of the "Jane Doe" attributed tasks are being filtered here, so I only have to see the things that I'm supposed to be doing if I'm Jane Doe. So as you can guess, month-two is going to be very similar to month-one, and month-three is going to be more of the same deal. You're going to go ahead and you're going to bring in what you're working towards. This color coding really helped with the month-three, this is what we're going to be working towards, and you're going to write in all the tasks to complete. These are going to show up in the "Contacts" as well as the "To Achieve in 90 days". So when I said earlier, we'll come back to that and see how interesting that looks. Yeah, you can see all of the tasks here as well. In case it was of interest to you, if you do have recurring tasks that aren't necessarily related to a goal, but you still have to keep the lights on, create and delegate recurring tasks in this table.

[00:23:09.860] - Lanie
So here you are, your quarterly plan in a way where your big-picture goals broken down into more or less modules that then get [singing 00:23:19] individual tasks associated to them. Now, when I say you're always going to have to keep your eye on the prize, you'll always be accountable to doing work that matters to your goals. What I mean by that is that if you are going to add a task here, "irrelevant task" goes here, and this doesn't actually relate to anything, you're going to have a big old gap here saying this doesn't have anything to do with what you're trying to accomplish. You're working on stuff, assigning tasks that don't even matter to your big-picture goals. That will always be evident here. In the next video, we're going to deal with something similar where you're always going to have to associate the content that you're creating to your big-picture message and to an offer that is designed to get you either paid or collect that email address.

[00:24:00.520] - Liz
Thank you so much for this session. I need to go and create probably a new workspace in Airtable to implement all the things I just learned. Thank you again. Any final thoughts for attendees before we talk about your free offer that you've got for everybody?

[00:24:16.250] - Lanie
So that first base that you saw that to build your content out, that is available with this talk, so it's totally free. You can find that second one, the bonus one that I showed you with the quarterly planning, that's available in the "All Access Pass". I'm giving the "Airtable Like A  Boss Light", it's the light version of my course, so you'll be able to do more cool beans things with Airtable in that course that's in the "All Access Pass." So grab it.

[00:24:43.840] - Liz
Yeah so if you are an "All Access Pass" holder already, get that. You'll get free access to that course. For those you who want to check out a little bit more before you go that route, definitely go grab the freebie. The link for that is below. Again, Lanie thank you so much for just sharing all your knowledge and helping everyone get a grip on the editorial calendar and the aspect of making sure your content converts.

[00:25:10.480] - Lanie
