Liz Stapleton [00:00:03]:
You.

Liz Stapleton [00:00:05]:
All right, guys, I'm super excited to have Anca from Social Bee joining me today. Thank you so much for taking the time. I really appreciate it.

Anca Pop [00:00:12]:
Sure. Hi.

Liz Stapleton [00:00:14]:
Yeah, because I've been a longtime fan of Social Bee. I've been using them.

Liz Stapleton [00:00:18]:
For years, I think.

Liz Stapleton [00:00:20]:
I honestly don't remember when I started using them, but I haven't had any cause to worry or think about that. So it's been great.

Anca Pop [00:00:27]:
Important.

Liz Stapleton [00:00:28]:
Yeah. And so I'm really excited for you guys this session. Can you tell me a little bit about your background and just what we're.

Liz Stapleton [00:00:34]:
Going to learn today?

Anca Pop [00:00:35]:
Sure.

Anca Pop [00:00:36]:
Well, I have a background in journalism and marketing, but here at Social Bee, I'm the customer success specialist and we try to focus all our efforts into educating the users as well as helping them along with the platform and also with some concierge services where we do the work for them if they don't have the time.

Anca Pop [00:00:57]:
And basically that's about it.

Liz Stapleton [00:01:01]:
Okay, so can you just give us some of the highlights of what we're going to learn?

Liz Stapleton [00:01:04]:
Because I am excited for it.

Anca Pop [00:01:06]:
We're going to learn about repurposing content. First of all, we're going to go through what repurposing content is, how you.

Anca Pop [00:01:14]:
Can do it, and more specifically, how.

Anca Pop [00:01:16]:
You can do that for social media. And then we're going to go into.

Anca Pop [00:01:20]:
A few tips and tricks.

Liz Stapleton [00:01:21]:
Yeah, I know you're going to be using SocialBee to show us how to do these things, so let's go ahead and dive in. But even though we're using Social, like, just the content, I'm excited for it because it's a struggle to come up with all the social media posts because they require variations and everything now.

Anca Pop [00:01:39]:
Yeah, exactly.

Liz Stapleton [00:01:41]:
So let's go ahead and get to it.

Anca Pop [00:01:44]:
Hi, everyone. I'm Anca from Social Bee and today I'm here to talk to you about how you can repurpose your content, save time, and win readers all in one go. Before I do that, though, I'd like to tell you a little bit more.

Anca Pop [00:01:58]:
About SocialBee and who we are as a company.

Anca Pop [00:02:01]:
We offer DOITYOURSELF social media management tools.

Anca Pop [00:02:05]:
As well as done for you concierge services, which means that we can handle your social media so that you can.

Anca Pop [00:02:13]:
Handle other aspects of your online presence. Now back to today's topic. We're going to talk about how you can extend the value of your blog posts and get more traffic to your website by doing one simple action repurposing your blog posts more in depth. We're going to go through what repurposing is, why you should repurpose your content, and more specifically, how you can do.

Anca Pop [00:02:40]:
It, or rather, how you can do it for social media.

Anca Pop [00:02:44]:
And then at the end, I'm also going to offer a few tips and tricks on how you can stay organized.

Anca Pop [00:02:50]:
As well as how you can save.

Anca Pop [00:02:53]:
Time when repurposing your content.

Anca Pop [00:02:55]:
Now, before we jump in, we've all.

Anca Pop [00:02:59]:
Been there where we think that we need to create new content all the time in order to get traffic to our website, right? Well, that's not necessarily the case. Creating new content all the time can be exhausting because, one, it's not easy to get fresh ideas all the time, and two, it takes a lot of time to write good content. So that's where repurposing comes in handy when you repurpose your content.

Anca Pop [00:03:32]:
So the content that you already have.

Anca Pop [00:03:34]:
You get more time to spend on articles that you want to write on, those that you need to nurture a little bit more so that you can get them just right. Basically, repurposing is a way in which you can recycle your existing blog posts into new formats, or just a way to produce more content in less time. Now, all of this gives you a lot of benefits, and that brings me to my next point why you should repurpose your content. We've chosen here a few main benefits for repurposing, but obviously these are not all of the benefits out there, so there may be others which we haven't mentioned. I'll start with telling you why repurposing helps your Return on Investment or ROI. It's because it maximizes your content or your content's value. In a way. It gets new audiences to view that content, to read it, and to engage with it. Think of it this way if you spend an amount of time and resources creating content, you want to make sure the majority of your audience, if not all of it, sees it right. That's why repurposing helps with ROI. It also helps with SEO because it helps drive more traffic to your website.

Anca Pop [00:05:11]:
Another benefit is what we call TAC.

Anca Pop [00:05:15]:
Which stands for Trust, Authority, and Consistency. Trust, because repurposing your content can offer a sense of trust from your audience, so that they trust what you're saying, which means that they're more likely to share your content more, and that also gives you more authority, which is the second point here. Authority is something that makes you more believable, and also consistency, which is very easy to do when you repurpose content. You can be consistent without having to worry that you need to write a new article right now. Now, we've also added a few other benefits, which are not acronyms fun and new. Fun, because it's fun to not be.

Anca Pop [00:06:11]:
Stressed about having to create content all.

Anca Pop [00:06:15]:
The time, because you know you have a backlog of content that you can.

Anca Pop [00:06:20]:
Repurpose and reuse so that you have.

Anca Pop [00:06:25]:
Consistent presence on your social media. And new, because, well, A, you can.

Anca Pop [00:06:31]:
Find new ways to talk about topics that you've already written about, and B.

Anca Pop [00:06:38]:
You can find new audiences to reach with those topics. Okay, so now that we know the benefits of repurposing content, let's go in deeper and see how you can repurpose your content.

Anca Pop [00:06:54]:
Before we go into the specifics, I.

Anca Pop [00:06:57]:
Want to tell you about the two.

Anca Pop [00:06:59]:
Main category every blog has.

Anca Pop [00:07:02]:
Category one is Evergreen content, or content that can be used throughout the year.

Anca Pop [00:07:08]:
No matter the day of the week or the date or anything like that.

Anca Pop [00:07:13]:
It's content that is not time sensitive. It's content that is not affected by.

Anca Pop [00:07:19]:
Any season or by any event.

Anca Pop [00:07:21]:
It's always good to go. Such examples can be articles with lists.

Anca Pop [00:07:28]:
Like Five benefits of doing a podcast, or five benefits of repurposing blog posts, for that matter.

Anca Pop [00:07:37]:
And the second category is content that is time sensitive or time bound. That's also a type of content that you should work with.

Anca Pop [00:07:49]:
But this is bound to an event or a time or date, so you.

Anca Pop [00:07:56]:
Shouldn't or it wouldn't make sense to share it past that date. Now, in today's webinar, we are going.

Anca Pop [00:08:04]:
To focus more on Evergreen content, but anything that we say here can also apply to time sensitive content. By the way, an example of time sensitive content are news articles which are time bound and usually lose their.

Anca Pop [00:08:23]:
Newsworthiness within a few days or weeks. Okay, so when you repurpose content, what.

Anca Pop [00:08:33]:
You need to do is first you.

Anca Pop [00:08:35]:
Need to look at your existing content, separate your content into these two categories.

Anca Pop [00:08:41]:
Work with the evergreen content into one category and the time sensitive content into a different category.

Anca Pop [00:08:49]:
Why this is important because there are different types of content.

Anca Pop [00:08:53]:
With Evergreen, you can just create an.

Anca Pop [00:08:57]:
Indefinite number of ways in which you.

Anca Pop [00:08:59]:
Can repurpose it and you can share it again and again without worrying about anything.

Anca Pop [00:09:04]:
With time sensitive content, you can repurpose it, but with one condition it has.

Anca Pop [00:09:10]:
To be before the end date or.

Anca Pop [00:09:14]:
The time when the content expires. Which means either the event that you're.

Anca Pop [00:09:19]:
Talking about or that actual date mentioned.

Anca Pop [00:09:23]:
In the article passes.

Anca Pop [00:09:24]:
So if you have an event within a month from now, you do have that full month where you can repurpose your content from when you first published.

Anca Pop [00:09:34]:
It, but you wouldn't want to publish.

Anca Pop [00:09:37]:
That article after the event, as it.

Anca Pop [00:09:40]:
Wouldn't be necessarily interesting to your audience once the event has passed and they can no longer attend it. That's why we focus more on Evergreen. Now, step two once you have your.

Anca Pop [00:09:53]:
Articles into these two categories, find the.

Anca Pop [00:09:58]:
Best and worst performing blog posts.

Anca Pop [00:10:01]:
You can do this with tools such as Google Analytics or Facebook Insights or anything that can provide some analytics on how your blog posts are performing. You can look at traffic, you can.

Anca Pop [00:10:17]:
Look at engagement, you can look at.

Anca Pop [00:10:19]:
Anything that can give relevant metrics in this sense.

Anca Pop [00:10:24]:
And what I want you to do is to first start with a top five of each. So find the top five best performing blog posts and find the top five that are worst performing for whatever reason. It does not matter at this point. What you want to do is you.

Anca Pop [00:10:42]:
Want to work with repurposing those first. And then you can go in and add more articles from your blog post as you work through them. Step three is to identify the types of content that you'll create. And here there's actually quite a few.

Anca Pop [00:11:00]:
Content types that you can create.

Anca Pop [00:11:02]:
You can go for podcasts, you can.

Anca Pop [00:11:04]:
Go for white papers, infographics, videos. You can answer questions on the web.

Anca Pop [00:11:10]:
On forums or quora. You can make audio versions, or you.

Anca Pop [00:11:15]:
Can just create newsletters.

Anca Pop [00:11:18]:
Or you can create social media posts, which is the type of content that we will be focusing on today.

Anca Pop [00:11:27]:
More specifically, let's see how you can.

Anca Pop [00:11:32]:
Repurpose for social media.

Anca Pop [00:11:35]:
Well, first of all, you need to look for the hooks. A hook is an actionable point in your article that can catch the interest of your audience.

Anca Pop [00:11:49]:
To exemplify this, sorry, I stumbled a bit. So to showcase this, we've chosen an.

Anca Pop [00:11:58]:
Article from BBC about Friends because we here at SocialBee love Friends very much and I'm sure you're familiar with this TV show already. So we have this article that we've.

Anca Pop [00:12:11]:
Already downloaded into a PDF and we've.

Anca Pop [00:12:15]:
Highlighted a few hooks that we can then later work with in our example.

Anca Pop [00:12:25]:
First of all, we've highlighted the title of the article, which in itself is always a hook.

Anca Pop [00:12:33]:
It's something that grabs the attention of.

Anca Pop [00:12:35]:
Your audience and makes them want to read more about that topic. Then we also highlighted.

Anca Pop [00:12:46]:
A lot more sentences or a lot more points from here from this article. But I'm not going to go through.

Anca Pop [00:12:52]:
All of them because it's quite an extensive article. I'm just going to show you, for instance, this quote that Monica says to Rachel in the first episode.

Anca Pop [00:13:06]:
Welcome to the real world.

Anca Pop [00:13:07]:
It sucks. You're going to love it. So we have all our hooks selected. We highlighted them. So the second step into repurposing your content for social media is to transform your hooks into posts. And then obviously, the third step is to publish them.

Anca Pop [00:13:28]:
Now, to transform your hooks into posts, there's quite a few ways you can.

Anca Pop [00:13:34]:
Do that and I'm here with a few content ideas on how you can actually do that.

Anca Pop [00:13:39]:
The first one on my list here.

Anca Pop [00:13:42]:
Is pulling a meaningful quote, which is exactly what I did with the Monica quote. So I highlighted the most famous quote Monica says to Rachel in the first episode.

Anca Pop [00:13:55]:
And then that's something that most Friends.

Anca Pop [00:13:59]:
Fans know and will identify very quickly. So.

Anca Pop [00:14:05]:
It definitely catches the attention of your audience like that. A few other content ideas are bold statements, key takeaways, or you can just.

Anca Pop [00:14:17]:
Use self explanatory images or gifs videos, anything like that.

Anca Pop [00:14:22]:
Or also use posts that can generate engagement, like polls or this or that, or questions.

Anca Pop [00:14:31]:
But finally, you can also add, in.

Anca Pop [00:14:35]:
Case you missed it, statements which basically summarize your post without giving away the full story. That means that your audience still gets.

Anca Pop [00:14:45]:
Interested in the topic and wants to read more. So they do go to your website and read the full blog post to.

Anca Pop [00:14:53]:
Find out the entire story there. Okay, so we have all the content.

Anca Pop [00:15:00]:
Ideas, we have the hooks, we have.

Anca Pop [00:15:03]:
What we want to do with the hooks to transform them into posts. So how exactly are we going to do that? Well, for each idea we need to first write captions that contain the hooks.

Anca Pop [00:15:16]:
That you previously identified, use relevant visuals.

Anca Pop [00:15:20]:
Around the captions, and then third, last but not least, add a clear call to action and a link back to the original post.

Anca Pop [00:15:29]:
This is always needed because this is.

Anca Pop [00:15:32]:
The way you're going to get traffic brought back to the post from your social media. Okay, so how do you stay organized with all of that? Well, our suggestion is an editorial calendar and I have one prepared right here.

Anca Pop [00:15:49]:
With the Friends article that I first showed you. This is a one month editorial calendar which has a few key points.

Anca Pop [00:16:00]:
Here we have the blog post title and the link for ease of access.

Anca Pop [00:16:05]:
And then we have a few columns here like the text which tackles the.

Anca Pop [00:16:10]:
Copy or the caption of your post.

Anca Pop [00:16:13]:
For instance, in the first post here, we have Joey's famous phrase, how are you doing? Which we follow up with a question.

Anca Pop [00:16:23]:
Have you read our latest blog post about Friends?

Anca Pop [00:16:27]:
Then we include the call to action.

Anca Pop [00:16:31]:
That is clear, find out how the series got to change so many generations all here, and then include the link so that they can actually find out.

Anca Pop [00:16:42]:
What we want them to find out.

Anca Pop [00:16:44]:
The second column tackles the visuals.

Anca Pop [00:16:47]:
This can either be an image, a GIF, a video, or even just a link preview, which is what usually social media platforms generate when you add a link to your post.

Anca Pop [00:17:02]:
Basically, it's a featured image from your post as well as a small description.

Anca Pop [00:17:07]:
Of what your post is about.

Anca Pop [00:17:09]:
Then you also have one that's very important, the publish date.

Anca Pop [00:17:14]:
This will help you keep everything organized because it spreads everything out in our.

Anca Pop [00:17:21]:
Example, throughout a full month, but you can go even further if needed. And also we have a fourth column.

Anca Pop [00:17:29]:
Added, which is a status so that you can have a better idea of what stage every post is at. So if you've already scheduled this post, you can just choose to set it.

Anca Pop [00:17:45]:
As scheduled, or if you've published it already, you can go ahead and set it to posted. And also this way you know exactly.

Anca Pop [00:17:54]:
How many posts are left to be scheduled or to be published in the future before you need to do this again.

Anca Pop [00:18:01]:
Now, I'm not going to go through.

Anca Pop [00:18:03]:
All of these examples because that would.

Anca Pop [00:18:06]:
Take a lot of time, but let's just dissect one or two more.

Anca Pop [00:18:10]:
For instance, the post number nine here.

Anca Pop [00:18:14]:
TV series Riddle Time, who are the six slightly clueless 20 somethings. Not sure where they were heading, but.

Anca Pop [00:18:23]:
Not too worried about it either. Tap to see.

Anca Pop [00:18:27]:
This is usually meant for something like.

Anca Pop [00:18:32]:
Instagram, for instance, where you get to tap on the story or swipe up.

Anca Pop [00:18:37]:
And go to the actual link.

Anca Pop [00:18:38]:
But it can also work for Facebook.

Anca Pop [00:18:41]:
Or any other platform. It basically creates engagement with the riddle, the fact that you obviously know the answer to this if you're a Friends.

Anca Pop [00:18:50]:
Fan, but it's also quite fun to.

Anca Pop [00:18:53]:
Answer and show everybody else that you know the answer. So that's what your audience will feel.

Anca Pop [00:19:00]:
When they see a post like this. We also have a little hint for the riddle, which is the beginning of their theme song, created on a black.

Anca Pop [00:19:13]:
Background, and that's about it on how.

Anca Pop [00:19:18]:
You can organize your posts.

Anca Pop [00:19:20]:
But this can take a lot of time.

Anca Pop [00:19:23]:
So how exactly can you save even more time when doing all of this prep, especially if you're doing this for.

Anca Pop [00:19:33]:
A bigger number of articles? Well, that's where Social Bee comes in handy.

Anca Pop [00:19:40]:
This is because the Social Bee app.

Anca Pop [00:19:42]:
Can offer evergreen categories, which helps with recycling and reusing your articles again and again. And we also offer variation features, which.

Anca Pop [00:19:53]:
Means that you can set different variations to your post.

Anca Pop [00:19:59]:
So basically what we did here in.

Anca Pop [00:20:01]:
The editorial calendar, these are variations of.

Anca Pop [00:20:05]:
The same blog post.

Anca Pop [00:20:06]:
We created separate posts for a longer.

Anca Pop [00:20:10]:
Period of time to promote the same blog post.

Anca Pop [00:20:14]:
Those are variations that Social Bee can.

Anca Pop [00:20:16]:
Handle as well as planning or customizing.

Anca Pop [00:20:19]:
Your posts for each platform.

Anca Pop [00:20:21]:
But don't take my word for it.

Anca Pop [00:20:23]:
Let's go into Social Bee and show you exactly how we can help with all of this.

Anca Pop [00:20:29]:
What you're seeing right now are categories from Social Bee. We have two types of categories, just like the two types of content that.

Anca Pop [00:20:38]:
You can have on your website. Evergreen content, which is the one that gets recycled and share once content, which is the one that can be time sensitive, or content that you only want to share once.

Anca Pop [00:20:51]:
Now, going into the category, you'll see.

Anca Pop [00:20:55]:
The posts that are included in that category and how they have variations. As you can see here, we have each one of the posts from the editorial calendar added as a variation to this post. We have created two specific posts, but.

Anca Pop [00:21:15]:
That's just because we want to spread this out over a longer period of time. You also have previews on how the.

Anca Pop [00:21:22]:
Post will look like on each selected social media platform. And also it's very easy to see.

Anca Pop [00:21:28]:
That when you add a post as well.

Anca Pop [00:21:30]:
So let's just do that for the sake of showing you.

Anca Pop [00:21:35]:
I'll just click add a post here.

Anca Pop [00:21:37]:
I'll select Twitter, LinkedIn and Facebook and then I'll just paste the first post from our editorial calendar. As you can see, it immediately generated a link preview, which is a visual that I was talking about earlier. And we also have everything ready here.

Anca Pop [00:21:55]:
On the right side we have a.

Anca Pop [00:21:57]:
Live preview on what your post will look like once published on each individual social platform. So we have it here for Facebook.

Anca Pop [00:22:06]:
Then this is what it will look.

Anca Pop [00:22:07]:
Like once published on Twitter and finally on LinkedIn as well.

Anca Pop [00:22:13]:
Now, you can also customize this for each profile and that's actually something that.

Anca Pop [00:22:18]:
We advise that you do simply because each platform has a separate tone of voice.

Anca Pop [00:22:25]:
Each platform has separate specifications when it.

Anca Pop [00:22:28]:
Comes to visuals like images, best practices and such. And also because each platform has a.

Anca Pop [00:22:35]:
Specific character limit that may not work for other platforms. For instance, on Facebook you can talk.

Anca Pop [00:22:43]:
Quite a lot about your posts and.

Anca Pop [00:22:46]:
Go more in depth. But on Twitter you need to limit yourself to 280 characters.

Anca Pop [00:22:53]:
So that means you need to keep.

Anca Pop [00:22:54]:
It short and sweet so you can do that within the same post while keeping the main essence of the post.

Anca Pop [00:23:02]:
The same for all of your platforms.

Anca Pop [00:23:06]:
You can also change the image for.

Anca Pop [00:23:08]:
Each one of them. So let's say we want to replace.

Anca Pop [00:23:12]:
The link with an actual image.

Anca Pop [00:23:15]:
We can also do that from here.

Anca Pop [00:23:17]:
Now, once you've customized it for each.

Anca Pop [00:23:20]:
Profile, you can also add variations, which.

Anca Pop [00:23:23]:
Are the ones that I showed you.

Anca Pop [00:23:25]:
A little earlier by clicking the Add variation button.

Anca Pop [00:23:29]:
Now I'm not going to do that.

Anca Pop [00:23:30]:
Because I already have prepared them here. So you can see all of the variations added here, as well as a yellow ring around the social media profile that you're seeing the version of. So if you were to change to customize the content for Twitter to be shorter, for instance, when you clicked on Twitter, it would show a shorter text. When you clicked on Facebook, it would show the version that you created for your Facebook and so on.

Anca Pop [00:24:02]:
Now, once you have all of this content created into your categories, the next.

Anca Pop [00:24:09]:
Step would be to schedule them.

Anca Pop [00:24:11]:
And you can do that directly from Social Bee. And I'm actually going to show you.

Anca Pop [00:24:16]:
A little on how our scheduling works. You're here in the schedule overview of Social Bee. This is where you can either generate a preset schedule that's based on Best Practices, it's something that we provide to help you get started, or you can create your own schedule starting from scratch. It's up to you fully.

Anca Pop [00:24:37]:
And you can include your categories here.

Anca Pop [00:24:40]:
So that you know exactly when each.

Anca Pop [00:24:43]:
Type of content is going out.

Anca Pop [00:24:45]:
For instance, we have our Friends category.

Anca Pop [00:24:48]:
Going out every Friday. This means that one of those posts.

Anca Pop [00:24:54]:
That we have in the Evergreen category will go out every Friday and it goes out in a top to bottom order, which means that we will take the first post from the top first. The second Friday we will have the second post go out, and so on.

Anca Pop [00:25:11]:
Until we reach the end of the list. And once that happens, if you don't.

Anca Pop [00:25:15]:
Add any other posts in that category, it will start again. Back from the top. Now, what this means, especially if you have a lot of content, is that you can even create content for a.

Anca Pop [00:25:29]:
Full year, which means that you really have saved a lot of time.

Anca Pop [00:25:35]:
Now, this is what Social Bee looks like, and I really hope that this.

Anca Pop [00:25:40]:
Catches your eye and you're curious more about it, because if you are, we have a special offer for you very soon. But first, let's look at what we've.

Anca Pop [00:25:53]:
Learned throughout this webinar. We talked about what repurposing is, which is recycling your content, why you should do it for reasons like Return on Investment and SEO, how you can do it by separating your content into two categories, evergreen and time bound, and then.

Anca Pop [00:26:14]:
Finding out some hooks that you can.

Anca Pop [00:26:17]:
Then transform into your social media posts. We talked about staying organized with an.

Anca Pop [00:26:24]:
Editorial calendar, as well as how you.

Anca Pop [00:26:27]:
Can save time through using Social Bee.

Anca Pop [00:26:32]:
Now, about that offer that okay, sorry about that offer. I wanted to tell you that you.

Anca Pop [00:26:41]:
Can.

Anca Pop [00:26:44]:
Try SocialBee for free for 14 days.

Anca Pop [00:26:47]:
And I actually have this page here.

Anca Pop [00:26:50]:
Which you can actually go through. It's social IO bloggerbreakthrough. And this is where you'll find more information on Social Bee.

Anca Pop [00:26:59]:
You can try it for free for 14 days, or you can get 20% off for one year when you purchase the tool. And you also get a complimentary onboarding, which is normally $199 if you sign up before the 1 March.

Anca Pop [00:27:15]:
Now, before I go, I wanted to launch a challenge, and that's the slide that I skipped there for a second. I want you to repurpose your content for ten days. That's all I want.

Anca Pop [00:27:31]:
Use the top five articles that we selected in the first step of repurposing.

Anca Pop [00:27:41]:
And then repurpose that content. And because we want to see you.

Anca Pop [00:27:45]:
Actually succeed in this challenge, please, please tag us on social media. We have here our Twitter handle, social, and on our Facebook handle, SocialB IO.

Anca Pop [00:27:58]:
Where you can reach out to us.

Anca Pop [00:28:00]:
And let us see how you put into work the ideas that we talked about in this webinar. I really hope you enjoyed this, and if you have any questions, feel free to contact us. We're available at hello@Socialbee.IO, and you can even contact us through the link that we provided right there with Socialbee.IO/Bloggerbreakthrough. Well, it's been fun for me. I hope it was for you, too. So enjoy.

Liz Stapleton [00:28:31]:
All right, Anca, thank you so much for sharing all that information. I know I learned a lot. I really loved the Joey example with a friend, which is just fantastic. And so I know you mentioned it in your presentation, but you guys do have a really great offer for attendees, which I appreciate you guys putting together. So thank you for that. But can we dive a little bit deeper into what it would look like? I think if they go to the link, I think they sign up for a trial before they even have to pay with the discount.

Anca Pop [00:29:00]:
Is that right?

Anca Pop [00:29:01]:
They definitely can if they want to, but they also can go ahead and purchase the platform right ahead if they.

Anca Pop [00:29:08]:
Also want to do that.

Anca Pop [00:29:09]:
The trial is 14 days, so they can try it for free before deciding if they want to purchase Socialbee or not. And we have multiple plans available, so depending on the budget or the size of your business, you can go for one or another plan.

Liz Stapleton [00:29:26]:
Yeah.

Liz Stapleton [00:29:27]:
And then so the concierge onboarding you're offering, that's huge. What is that? What are you taking off their initial.

Anca Pop [00:29:36]:
Set up, first of all.

Anca Pop [00:29:37]:
And if they have content on other social media management tools, we can also migrate that content over so that they don't lose anything. Everything's right where it's supposed to be and ready to be published.

Liz Stapleton [00:29:51]:
Yeah. Because bloggers are always struggling to find time. We have lots of sessions on that. So I think that's a huge value I had to get set up when I started with Social Bee. If you want to make sure it gets set up right and also just your stuff gets moved over without you having to sweat it, that's fantastic.

Anca Pop [00:30:13]:
Give you a few guidelines on how you can navigate the social media world within that onboarding. So we create the initial batch of content for you to base your strategy on further on.

Liz Stapleton [00:30:27]:
Yeah, I mean, that's fantastic. So definitely go check that offer out, guys.

Anca Pop [00:30:31]:
The link is below.

Liz Stapleton [00:30:33]:
Again, thank you so much for taking the time. I appreciate it, Harvey.

Anca Pop [00:30:36]:
I really hope everybody had something to learn from our presentation.
