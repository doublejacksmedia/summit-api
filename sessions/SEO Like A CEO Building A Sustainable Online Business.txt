Liz Stapleton [00:00:00]:
Alright, guys. this session today I would say is with Eric from Mediavine. MediaVine, I feel like is what a lot of bloggers are aspiring to. So I'm excited to have you guys with us because people are either responding to it or they're already on Mediavine. So thank you for being here. Appreciate you taking the time.

Eric Hochberger [00:00:16]:
Yeah. No. Excited to be here and excited to talk about topic that's not ads. So that would be fun.

Liz Stapleton [00:00:21]:
Yes. We're already talking, some some SEO stuff, but I love the title that you guys gave with SEO, like, CEO because a lot of the sessions are, yeah, this is a business guys. You need to, you need to kind of cover that business side, which isn't taught a lot of places. so can you give us a little bit on your background and just some highlights of what we're gonna learn today?

Eric Hochberger [00:00:41]:
Yeah. So my background funny enough is actually in SEO and not in ads. So I've been doing SEO, like I say, since before Google was a thing in, like, 1996/1997, like,

Eric Hochberger [00:00:52]:
is actually when I first started. My first job in 1998 was doing SEO, for, like, a local company down here in South Florida. So I've been doing this for a while, and that's actually how Mediavine got to start in 2004. So my background is in as SEO as SEO can be. I'm also a computer engineer by school, so I like to focus on kind of more technical side of things.

Liz Stapleton [00:01:14]:
Awesome. and can you just a touch on sort of what we'll learn today in in your presentation.

Eric Hochberger [00:01:20]:
Yeah. so today, I'm gonna be focusing on if people have ever read my parboil post on the Mediavine blog that's, I don't know, infamous, maybe only amongst media vine people, but it's gonna be kind of related content. How can you use related content to boost the rankings of your top performing posts. So it's really about improving rankings of your existing posts more so than anything, and it's gonna focus a lot on content strategy.

Liz Stapleton [00:01:43]:
Yeah. Because it's it's, way easier to boost something that's already ranking somewhat than it is to, like, start a whole new piece of content, which Yes. That's good and important too, but, yeah, so I'm excited. I'm gonna let you kind of take over and and I might pop in with a question you're in there.

Eric Hochberger [00:02:02]:
Please. I like to get a little technical at times. So if it's too technical, stop me. I I would love that.

Liz Stapleton [00:02:07]:
Okay.

Eric Hochberger [00:02:12]:
Alright. You can see my screen. We're ready to go. Alright. Let's do it. Alright. So as Liz said, we're gonna be talking about SEO today from, kind of a quick Crash course at the beginning. I'm gonna go over kind of my style of SEO, and then we're gonna go into all the fun related keywords we were talking about and related content. First, again, why is an ad guy talking about SEO? because, again, this is my background, and this is Mediavine background. 16 years ago, we were actually an SEO for hire firm far before we got into ads. So any of the better question is why is this SEO company talking to me about ads all the time? But, no. It's fine. we're definitely more of an ad network company now. but honestly, one of the biggest reasons you should listen to us is because of the Hollywood gossip. some people don't know this, but Mediavine started the Hollywood gossip in 2006. We owned and operate that site, and it was at the time three guys knew nothing about celebrity gossip, but knew a lot about SEO. We use those tricks to grow the Hollywood gossip into about 30 to 60,000,000 page views a month is one of the largest gossip sites on the internet. We still use these practices today. so the stuff I'm preaching, actually works in the real world. today's focus is mostly gonna be on not the Hollywood gossip, though, because I don't know if that's address relatable to most, people that will be listening to this. So instead we're gonna focus on Sugar dish me, which is actually a blog run by our director of publisher support, Heather. This is her own personal blog. And it's a food blog. and, basically, we're gonna go over the strategy we did for her site, which is using Google search console to identify some of the top keywords she's ranking for. We develop new content and linking strategies around those, top ranking posts. then she created new posts. use that linking strategy. We made a few content tweaks, to the post itself. and we're gonna follow along and, obviously, it worked, or I wouldn't be using it as the case study. so quickly, before we get into all of the content strategy, because a lot of it does involve tweaks you're gonna be making, I wanna go over kind of the basics and my interpretation stuff, and this is what I like to call my little disclosure. this in general, is my style of SEO, and it's maybe a little oversimplified from what people are used to. And that's because I kind of ignored the SEO experts and most of the algorithm changes. I believe in kind of the theory of content is king. write good content. It will rank well in Google. Ignore the individual algorithm changes. I know a lot of people were hurt by the recent verts or whatever the the recent algorithm is named. It's important to remember this stuff is all a 0 sum game, or, basically, some people gain traffic, some people lose traffic. generally, the people who gain traffic tend to be a little quieter right now. they don't wanna kinda commiserate in everyone's losses. So people did gain from this, and that's what we've seen at Mediavine. A lot of our publishers gain, a lot lost. Unfortunately, that's just a nature of an algorithm change. What's important to focus on is not the name of the algorithm. It's what changed, right, what Google tells you to change. That's kinda my mantra. Listen to Google, focus on good content. When Google's recommendation changes, you should change how you're doing stuff. And overall, the strategy has worked for us. We've been through so many algorithm changes over the years, and the Hollywood gossip is still ranking well. You're gonna gain some. You're gonna lose some. Zoom out. keep writing good content and just listen when Google tells you something changes. Alright. Let's get in with it. Alright. So we're gonna be talking a lot about keywords today. but interestingly, I'm gonna go to back to the basics of what we define as keyword as because weirdly so often, I think I have a definite different definition of a keyword than what a lot of bloggers do. So when I say keywords, I really mean, I think key phrases a lot of times, you'll hear the industry call these as long tail keywords. So an example, sorry, it's gonna be very food heavy, cheesecake, versus low carb strawberry cheesecake recipe. In this example, a lot of people would say cheesecake is the keyword or strawberry is the cheesecake or even recipe. Those are not really the keywords you should be looking at. You should be looking at the whole thing as your keyword. Low carb strawberry cheesecake recipe. And that's what's called a long tail keyword. So a short tail keyword is something like cheesecake. It is a bigger search, and you may think I wanna go after the bigger search. That's not actually a useful search for you. We're gonna tell you that the long tail is more useful for your site. The reason why is it comes down to intent of the searcher. what is the reader actually looking for? In cheesecake, you have no idea. Are they looking to buy cheesecake? Are they looking to figure out what cheesecake is? I have no idea what they're searching for. They're just looking for pictures of cheesecake. You have no idea about a low carb strawberry cheesecake recipe. You know, if you're a recipe blogger, you have that for them. That is your exact user you want. They're gonna be more valuable for you. Sign up for your newsletter, become an engaged reader that's gonna keep coming back. So they're even better for you. Plus, the good news is there's a lot more of them. They make up about 70% searches on the internet, and they're a lot easier for you to win, as an independent publisher compared to the big guys who are going after the big turns. So everything we're talking about in key phrase, even though I'm gonna keep saying the word keyword, key phrase. And this is just the basics of a page title. Hopefully, everyone knows what a page title is. It's, you know, the name of your post, and Yost, they call it the SEO title. The key here that I think a lot of people miss is that key phrase that we're talking about. Make sure you use it in the page title as much as you can in its entirety, not broken up, So back to the previous example, you have to use that whole thing, low carb strawberry cheesecake recipe if that's what you're going after, and put it towards the beginning You'll see this hilariously all over the Hollywood gossip where we'll begin with Kate Middleton pregnant. She's not actually pregnant right now. Right? I don't know. I I'm not actually gonna tell her to gossip, but we'll begin with that and then a colon and then the rest of the headline. So we'll always begin with that key phrase that we're going after or that key word And that's that's important. if you want to have a more clickable title, you wanna add more stuff to it. Completely understood. But the reason why beginning with it is so important There's this thing called keyword prominence, but we, okay. In the English language, we read left to right, and it's really important that you have your key phrase at the beginning because when you're looking down that column of search results, you're looking from left to right. Make sure your key phrase is at the beginning. We're just gonna highlight it. You're gonna become more clickable. and Google in general does have page title. It's a pretty high ranking signal. So put your key phrase towards the beginning. Seems like obvious advice after you hear someone say it out loud, but nobody follows this for some weird reason, follow it. and it will definitely help with rankings. Alright. Quick little summation on content formatting and linking. I've, actually, a pretty good blog post on this on the Mediavine blog, so I'm gonna go short into this, but write more. More is better when it comes to SEO. I like to say 3 to 500 words minimum. And the reason why is because the more content you're writing, the more phrases you're just gonna get in there you're gonna be able to rank for more long tail keywords. It won't necessarily help you with your ranking of that post itself because Google is just looking Are you an expert on this one particular topic? And maybe it only takes you a 100 words to do that, but if you can get more key phrases in there, there's more chances for you to rank. You're not just going for ranking on one key phrase. You might rank on other key phrases as a result of doing this. So, right, as much content as you can. once you start running into things, don't start doing fluff. nobody wants that. Certainly not Google. So if you can only answer this question a 100 words, I guess, stop at that point, but maybe rethink how you're writing, if you read my personal SEO blog posts or any of my ad posts on the Mediavine blog, they're all over a 1000 words. and I'm talking about ads So that's not that exciting. I feel like you could probably get whatever your topic is, you're passionate about it. 3 to 500 should be your minimum. Mhmm. and, again, aim for more. always use web friendly paragraphs. I'm obsessed with this, but I would say, look at it on a mobile phone. If you just do what you're taught in school, 3, 4, 5, or 6, sentence long paragraphs, they're gonna look like a giant block of text on your phone, break them up, hit enter more often, put photos in there. It's a more engaging experience for a user. It's super important that you have a good engaging experience. Remember, Google, wants to send users to a page that they're going to consume the content and enjoy the experience. When Google sends you someone to a page, they're basically recommending that page. Google looks at is their traffic. They're sending it to your site. They want that user to have a good user experience. just why a lot of people always say user experience kinda drives SEO. and again, just like your page title, make sure you use that key phrase early on in your post. but don't stuff. I see a lot of people do this, but they'll try to use that keyword throughout the entire post, and they use it unnaturally. Yeah. Like, I get the

Liz Stapleton [00:11:04]:
green light in the Yoast or whatever. Yeah. No. Don't.

Eric Hochberger [00:11:08]:
I'm gonna bite my tongue on so much thing so many things about Yoast, but don't obsess. for those lights in general. We

Liz Stapleton [00:11:13]:
we've already covered that in other sessions of of it's a good guideline, but don't obsess about it. Don't stress.

Eric Hochberger [00:11:19]:
Exactly. Exactly. Don't stress. That is literally my mantra of all this stuff. Sending them and related phrases are better, if anything, than using that same keyword. And when it's linking, linking is more important than your content itself. Google judges you based on your links, and that is internal and external. I'm not gonna go too deep into this because, actually, again, I have a blog post and a video on page rank, super complex topic. lot of people don't talk about Page rank anymore in 2020. I think that's crazy. page rank is literally the original algorithm that started Google. It is named after Larry Page himself, one of founders. I have a video that explains kinda how page rank works, but what it comes down to is links our votes in the Google system, and you can vote for yourself. and you can vote multiple times. it's a little different in that, you know, if you vote for two people now and you divide your votes in half, if you vote for ten people, you divide your votes in 10 Again, I'm not gonna go into the whole thing of page rank, but this is basically the crux of what we're gonna be doing today is the linking strategy. So it's important to note, that who you link to or what you link to says as much about your page as what links to you. so be careful on what you linked to only link to related stuff. whenever possible. You're gonna wanna do something that's called basically sculpting your page rank or making sure that you are structuring, your link structure, and then in a way that is highlighting your valuable content. So I like to use this little silo chart that we made teal here. It's important to note your homepage is almost always gonna be your highest ranking thing. The thing that has the most votes or the most page rank. The reason why is because most people that link to you typically link on your homepage, and I can guarantee you have a link to your homepage on every single page on your site. So if out of doubt, your homepage will always be your most valuable page. something I always like to think of is how far away is the content I'm trying to rank for from the home page? How many links away? and this is why you'll often see people use what's called cornerstone content in the Yoast world or silos or categories, whatever you wanna call them, you're gonna use these to basically sculpt your pagerank. Your homepage should always link to these and your article should always link back to them. Think about that as you're writing any of the posts we're gonna be talking about later. How can I link back to my style. And don't worry that we'll be coming back to this. This is kind of the the the briefer overview. So again, got your supporting post, that help boost up that cornerstone. And that cornerstone obviously sends the the page rank back up to the home page, but the important thing is the home page is linking to that corner stone as well. So you're you're going to have to link a lot, basically, is what it's gonna come down to. I often hear this question, how often should you how many internal links should you have on a post? And it's not important to think about how many. It's more about how often so, yes, I mentioned you are dividing up your post or your page rank when you link to multiple things. That's okay. Don't worry about that. dividing it up and voting for yourself is good. Vote a lot for yourself. It's the only links you can control. The important thing is not to over saturate your article with links. I hate seeing a bolded list of links, like, at the end of a post. I know a lot of people used to do that or a bunch of images that are just your links. Google reads the words around your links just as much as they use the or text itself, because it's a contextual search engine at the end of the day. so as long as you're following kind of this idea of I'm going to have a lot of words around each of my links. You can never overlink. So, you know, link once or twice per paragraph. Think about it that way. and just add more paragraphs if you wanna add more links. You will never have too many links if you write with that style. And the more it is better, I promise you. As long as it's good for user experience. So link to things that are related. Again, going back to that silo. External linking, I know a lot of bloggers like to avoid this, but links are just as important as internal links. What and that's what you link to and who links to you. Both are important. Yeah. It's actually important to link out to people and make them do follow links. Stop with the rel equals no follow. That's not helping anyone. You should only be using that if it's for kind of an affiliate or something you're being paid for. Right? Never use temp for linking to another blogger unless that blogger is paying you. but always keep the ratio of as many internal links as you can to extra links. So if you use 1 extra link, make sure you have, like, 5 to 10 internal links more if you can. keep the page ranked to yourself. Give a little bit of it out. Show Google, hey. This is the topic I'm talking about. Always try to link to an authority. don't freak out that authority is going to outrank you. They're probably already outranking you if they're an authority, rank alongside them, like, rise together. Alright. Now let's get into the good stuff. all the kind of basics are over that I'm gonna be kind of referring back to. I just wanna make sure we're all on the same page with my definition of those basics.

Liz Stapleton [00:16:09]:
Yes.

Eric Hochberger [00:16:11]:
Alright. So Google search console. It's a little bit of an older screenshot. you can see from the dates here in August, they may have changed. They've added new features in then. but this one is still there. and this is going to be basically your free tool to figure out what your pages are ranking and which ones you should improve your rankings So it's free. Everyone has it. You don't need to split it. A cost at SEM SemRush with 5 of your buddies. You can. SemRush is awesome. it's a great tool, but this one is free and even better because it's exact data from the only person that has the exact data. Google. so what you're gonna wanna do is go into the performance, tab in the side and click on, Google search results, basically. and I have step by step instructions here. And you're gonna wanna add the average position to make sure you get the ranking. That's not on by default. that's gonna show you your ranking on these keywords, and it's not there again, but it's also added in. and then you're gonna wanna store it by either clicks or impression. clicks or how many people come to your page. I prefer impressions. That's how many times you were shown. You know, if you're in the top

Liz Stapleton [00:17:14]:
10,

Eric Hochberger [00:17:14]:
you might not get a lot of clicks to your post, but you'll definitely still get a lot of impressions, because people will see the ranking. They just might not click on it because not everyone clicks on result 10 or 20 or 30. but then most people click on the top 3 as you can find out. So what we're gonna be looking for, or we also wanna expand the date range to as long as we can, or at least the last 3 months, you're not just focusing on your most recent stuff, and look for terms, you're in the top 10. but not ranked number 1. That's not useful. We're not here to improve your number 1 ranking. We're gonna leave that alone. Maybe you wanna maintain that ranking and shoot a couple links over to it. But chances are you may know a lot of the terms you rank for. You're looking for stuff. You have 2 through

Eric Hochberger [00:17:56]:
10.

Eric Hochberger [00:17:56]:
and then you're gonna wanna find the post that you're ranking on. You can do this by searching for Google, or there's actually a way, you can switch it over, from queries over to pages, that other tab, and it will show you which pages actually ranking there. so once you find the post, we are going to get to work on it to improve our rankings. So this one, was Heather's, post called 10 Minute Pizza Dough from 2013, and she found out she was ranking on quick Pizza dough. at the time. She was ranked somewhere in, I believe, like, 9 or 10. unfortunately, she did not maintain this. I'm gonna go into that at at the end of this. But what you're gonna wanna do is, first, you look at this post, and you could probably say, hey. It is not named correctly based on everything Eric said at the beginning. is there not even the word quick anywhere in there? And we'll get into that. but this is the post we're gonna be focusing on. 10 minute pizza dough ranking for quick pizza though, which is apparently a pretty big term, from a 2013 article, what do we do? Okay. So first off, yes. I required her to change that page title to be quicky today. I told her to add more words. She did not. you know, you can only do so much as an SEO consultant here helping people. But quick pizza dough is definitely gonna rank better than 10 minute pizza dough for the phrase quick pizza dough. She also didn't even have that key phrase anywhere early on. So you can see here I had her add a paragraph. I don't know if other bloggers besides food bloggers love to do this. Maybe everyone who gets traffic from Pinterest loves leading with some giant image at the very beginning of their post with no text because that's just like an old Pinterest adage. I don't know where it comes from.

Liz Stapleton [00:19:35]:
Yeah.

Eric Hochberger [00:19:37]:
Who knows? Yeah. let let's kill it if we can together today. get text in there early on. Google always parses text better than video images. We've got some awesome job parsing images and a freakishly good job parsing videos if you ever a Google hangout, you can turn on translations and be freaked out at how well they do at transcribing stuff. But at the end of the day, it's a lot easier for them to figure out what your text is about than those other things. So give them more text, and certainly earlier on, as I was mentioning, it's all about Prominence. How early on did you get that key phrase? If you have an image first, you're not gonna get that key phrases early on. So lead with text. This was again a compromise. She gave me 2 sentences. I would love more. I would have walls of text if were up to me before the images start coming in. But I understand you gotta balance your Pinterest, your SEO, and all your goals. Yeah. So that's fine. Get that key key phrase early on if you can. And she added more content, and this is one of my favorite tricks that we use all the time in the Hollywood gossip. I hate republishing. I know bloggers love to republish, so it shows back up in their feed. that's not what you should be doing. that's actually lying to Google because she don't realize that you're actually sending all of these dates to Google if you're running WordPress. WordPress does this automatically for you and meta tags. You're gonna say when the post is created, when it was last updated. And if you start messing with those things, you're messing with Google. And in general, don't lie to Google. it's it's not best practice. They're smart. They store these URLs. They know when they're last modified when they were created. don't republish. Heather didn't have to republish this thing. If anything, I understand you wanna link from your homepage again, and I agree. Right? That was that whole silo thing. We do wanna link from your homepage. But don't do it via republishing. it's, again, it's a trick. not a great one. We'd love to come with a solution. I have some ideas actually for a plug in to help publishers do this at some point in a way that would be Google friendly. But for now, instead, think about updating that post. in this particular example, this was a 2013 article back then, Heather used to talk a lot more about dogs than she did about pizza, in her pizza post. So she updated her post to talk a little bit more about pizza. There's still a lot of stuff about dogs in there because that's Heather. and then she added something called what I like what I like to say is getting the date in the text.

Liz Stapleton [00:21:56]:
What?

Eric Hochberger [00:21:56]:
It's a little update section saying what you updated about the post. great for the reader. Right? If they come and they see 2013, they might freak out. But if there's a big thing towards the top that says August 2019 update, and it's also gonna show up. Don't worry. In some Google searches that they're looking for. And, again, this should be 2020, old example. But, yeah, if you add that recent date in that little section, Google will parse that. You'll start seeing it show up in search results, especially when people add dates in. And it's just great for the user. Right? They're they want to know it was updated, especially your readers that might be coming back to this. Your your old readers, your 2013 readers that are wise as quick pizza dough being mentioned again, give them the updates. Chances are you've learned something about that particular topic in the last 7 years. I hope so. Right? We we all get better at these things. So a little recent date thing is awesome. Exclusively write the date, even though you are going to, like I said, WordPress is gonna mention on these things in the meta tags, always great to have it in the content for the readers and even Google. So that's what Heather did on what's called kind of the on page things. Right? The idea of what can I tweak on the page itself to improve the ranking? And it worked. and I'll go over why she kinda lost the rankings in a bit. but She went from, you can see, this was a slow and steady path. It took a few months. She kept adding Keto. and real quick, I am gonna say, because if you do search for this, you're gonna see she lost her ranking. She's now back down to

Liz Stapleton [00:23:21]:
8.

Eric Hochberger [00:23:21]:
The reason why is because I like to always think of, like, SEO as like a, like, almost like a garden. Right? You gotta maintain it. So going back to what we were saying before is once that post is so many post, pages away from the home page and you stop having this related content, you stop linking to it, you're gonna lose the ranking. And, unfortunately, we keep Heather very busy here at Mediavine doing all her job duties, and maybe she doesn't have as much time to blog about pizza dough as she'd like. So eventually she lost this ranking, but you don't have to. You can see here it was a slow and steady gain. That's one of the other things her number about SEO. even if you update a post and Google is normally super fast at indexing, right, when it comes to news content, you will see Google have all the news content within, like, 20 minutes of an article being posted on PhD. Sometimes, like, 2 or 3 minutes, freakishly fast. So I know you want your results to be that fast when you're doing this kind of stuff. It's not. it comes to reindexing older content, especially content that is not time sensitive, Google is gonna take its sweet time. so always zoom out when you're doing this stuff. don't declare this a failure because you didn't improve your rankings in a week or 2. It took literally months. You can see the slow and steady rise for Heather. And you can see this chart goes up and down. Google has multiple different data centers. They don't just do 1 or 2 or 3 updates a year, whatever they announce. they're doing updates all the time. Small little tweaks. You could literally get different search results from a friend across the country because they're hitting up a different data center. that's where you kinda see this up and down motion. Yeah. again, it comes down to that's why Google uses things like average position in here. don't obsess about your individual search result from the search you're doing. Focus on this average position to know what's working and zoom out. 3 months. Long play. Okay. So, again, a lot of lot of pretense and preface for this. So quick pizza dough is the search we're going after. oh, that's just bragging about Heather's rankings. Good for Heather. the the key is we want to create related content, as I keep saying, what can we do? So in this particular example, we're gonna think of quick pizza dough as our silo or our cornerstone content what other content can we now create under that cornerstone? You might be thinking quick pizza dough. There's no way that could be cornerstone. You cannot create a series of content around quick pizza dough. You are so wrong. I gave Heather so many posts she could write about. so one of the things you're gonna wanna do is searching Google itself for quick pizza dough. and please use incognito mode if you're a Safari user. I don't know why you are, but full search what's called private browsing in there. the reason you wanna do this is because Google is tracking you as a user and customizing search results tailored to you. And if you search, incognito, just gonna give you the general purpose search results, and that's what you care about. So here, we're gonna search for quick pizza dough, and you're gonna see there's 3 sections we're gonna or 4 sections we're talking about. people also asked my favorite. There's a related search. You can see here they got different pizza ingredients and pizza crust types. Now at the bottom is searches related to quick Pizza dough. Google is literally telling you here what content is related to quick Pizza dough. know you were just saying, I don't have any related content after I bought quick pizza though. Google has a ton of it for you. The fun part is there's even more than what you're seeing right here. If you go to the people also ask and click on click on one of the questions, they start showing you more. I don't want you to get too far down the rabbit hole because you'll start see a little bit of insight into Google's search algorithm. It's gonna freak you out because you're gonna quickly go from pizza dough to, I don't know, logs or something completely unrelated. If you keep clicking through, it gets weird. so generally around, like, 20 posts like, or whatever we have here. This is as far down as you should probably need to go. If you get to where it start, you know, it's no longer talking about pizza dough, we went too far. And that's just the way the Google algorithm kind of finds things related. and there are things related to pizza dough that somehow won't be pizza. So this is a terrible example. It's early in the morning for me. Alright. so we have these examples right here. Right? How do you store pizza dough for a few hours? How long do you cook pizza dough at 400? Each one of these could be an entire post. Some of them you're gonna see are kind of related. Like, how do you want? You cook pizza dough at 4 25 degrees versus 400. Maybe you could kinda put the 2 of those into one post because they're related. into, like, how long do you put pizza and kinda answer those in individual kind of a faq style, frequently asked questions. There's a lot of different ways to tackle this, but in general, I like to think of each one to be a single post topic when you can. And I know if you're a food blogger, you typically only blog about recipes and you don't do these single kind of post things. I don't care. Every single blogger can do questions and and answer them in their blog post. And you can definitely turn this so it doesn't feel unnatural. Make it work for your site. And most of these topics you can typically write at least 3 to 500 words on. so, basically, what I'd want you to do is put all these down, in some sort of whatever you guys use to stay organized in your lives. I don't care if it's a Google doc or if you have something fun like a signer, Get your stuff in there and know that you're not gonna write these all today. Don't stress out. I'm not gonna ask you to write 20 posts on pizza dough in one day. we would all go mad, but this is gonna be creating kind of like a content calendar for you to do. Alright. So why are we doing this? Alright. So Google already thinks you're an expert, clear on quick pizza dough, and they're telling you this stuff is things that are related to quick pizza dough. If you answer those questions, 1, it's gonna establish who has more of an expert on quick pizza dough. Right? You have so much knowledge about pizza dough now in Google's eyes, but also if you're likely an expert on pizza dough, you're gonna be an expert on all these different pizza dough topics. For whatever reason, Google has deemed you an expert on this, embrace it. Every one of these new posts gives you a chance to rank. you're gonna rank on these new posts a lot easier than you would any other post you go to write. We throw a lot of stuff at the wall as bloggers. Right? We try to write in some stuff. We wanted to break into the top 100 on, and that's disheartening. And in some stuff, you'll break into the top 10. Find the stuff you're ranking to the top 10. Keep going with it. again, because you're gonna keep improving your rankings on all of these different posts. But the most important thing you're doing here with this related content is you're linking back to your cornerstone. So every single one of these posts, is an excuse to link back the quick pizza dough, send that linked equity, and Google loves when you're linking to a post on our related post. Again, they gave you the list of related posts. Alright. So I went back to that example. there's more than just the questions. There's also those little related searches at the bottom, and you saw there was a lot more. Right? There was, different types of pizza dough was shown down there. Okay? So let's do recipes for other types of pizza dough that showed all your other search results below. oh, and another fun one here's an example. that Heather was able to do. She created different pizza recipes that use that pizza though. So think about other terms, and this is ones that you don't even have to get from Google. that could reuse that content, and this applies to everything besides just food. Alright. So back to that whole chart that I've said would come back. Alright. So the supporting post now, those are your related content going back to that chart. So that's travel flats. That's travel boots and slippers down below. that's all trying to improve our ranking on best travel shoes in this example. So back to what you were saying before, your quick pizza, though, would be all of would be that silo up top, your cornerstone, and in every single post you put down below, look at that as they can link to each other, but the most important thing is they link back up to the category page or to the cornerstone or to your quick pizza dough, this is the whole purpose of the exercise. If you forget that link, I I don't you know, you're still gonna get rankings probably on those new terms and maybe it wasn't a complete waste of your time, but always think back to the original goal. It's not just finding new traffic on that topic, improving your ranking on the old. So, you can also always keep going through those related posts to make them linked to the other. It might be tough sometimes to struggle, as I was saying, you wanna have, like, a link per paragraph. The good news is as you write more and more of a simulated post, you're gonna have more stuff to link to. you can go back through those kind of related posts as you write new ones, go back, update the old ones. Again, you can always do a little update section to bring them back up. and always linked here again. say it a million times your cornerstone. Alright, so this sounds terrible, and here's the funny part. You're not just gonna do it for quick pizza dough. You probably are in the top 10 for maybe 10, 20, 30 turns. So I'm gonna recommend you do to keep yourself sane is develop an entire content strategy around this. you're gonna have a lot of different terms that you're going after. It might not just be pizza dough, I think, Heather at the time was also ranking on chicken fillies, like a cheese steak, but with chicken, So, again, we can have so many of these happening at once, develop a bunch of Philly cheesesteak recipes at the same time you're doing a ton of pizza dough and kind of space it out for for your sanity, but also for your readers. Right? A lot of stuff is gonna appear in your feed don't wanna look like you're just a freak that talks about nothing but pizza though for the next several months of your life. you want other content in there. think one of the most important things is just can't be your only content strategy. This is something you're doing on the side. One of the most important things is keep writing original content while you're doing this. So you're gonna have a variety of these little, related post things happening in your in your content calendar but you're also gonna make sure that you have time to write new stuff. It's gonna help you keep your sanity as a writer. Nobody wants to write about the same topic all the time. But more importantly, how else are you gonna find new term that Google thinks you're an expert on? The only way you're gonna get that is from new original content. So this is just a supplement is the way I want you to look at it. And since I know we have more than just food bloggers in the audience and people hate that I obsess about food in all of my examples. It just happened so much from the Mediavine roots. I just wanna show you some examples that you can use this strategy in pretty much any genre. here's a great example of travel. I just did a search for Berlin travel guide. What do you know? Lots of people also ask suddenly, we can do a little 3 day itinerary for Berlin travel. The link back to our travel guide is Berlin in a good city break. I don't know what that means. what to do in Berlin locals, sometimes you're gonna have to take again these phrases and translate them to more coherent English, because a lot of times, I'm sure you do this as sir, when you're searching in Google, I certainly do. You just start slapping words at the end of the sentence as you're thinking about them to narrow them in. Leaders do it also. So what to do in Berlin with your local? That's fine. You can you can change it a little bit on this stuff and Google is smart enough. to kind of relate those keywords. Again, when it comes back to that key phrase, don't always obsess about getting the exact keyword as Google. Get the exact intention. Looks like broken English, certainly not Google, certainly not your readers.

Liz Stapleton [00:34:45]:
Yeah.

Eric Hochberger [00:34:46]:
Is Berlin expensive? Again, all of these, you could see If you write about Berlin, how you're already an expert on it, you can give basically a different version of that post the relevant information. You'll probably have new different information linking back to your travel guide. Really easy to see how Berlin travel guide no longer is just the post, but it is a hub for a whole series of content. And that is what Google is looking for when they're looking for a good search result on something like this. It's a little more, big picture, a little more cornerstone. like, get, become the hub, become the authority on Berlin travel. And, again, this just keeps going, but kindergarten tips for parents, parenting bloggers can use this exact same trick. Again, that people also ask will go on forever. won't go in, in specific example, fashion bloggers, really any lifestyle bloggers. These search results will appear all the time. If you don't get a people also asked when you do your particular search result, try turning your search result into a question. So or, like, how to or why. and then suddenly, can you you can see all the examples here. Get those words in there that make it a question if Google, for some reason, isn't presenting that, though they love to do the people also ask. because for them, it means there's a chance that the reader's gonna stay on Google and not come to your site. Google's goal ultimately is to keep their traffic on their search engine. I know we don't like that. Yeah. But we should should all be thankful for the traffic Google gives us. again, because it is ultimately their traffic. Right? So their goal is to keep it there. so they try to kinda give all these examples for their readers so their readers keep clicking around. So you'll typically see them, but if not, Again, just kinda tweak your your key phrase, until it becomes more of a question. So what to learn in a job interview is obviously like, a question already, so it's definitely gonna get it. and how to is another great example for, like, Craft and DIY bloggers. their content is, like, built for people also ask. it'll literally give you so many results because by nature, most of that stuff is already written as kind of a question in answer with the how to stuff. So, really, this works for anything. Now quickly to go over, Mediavine since we do ads, how do ads fit in with SEO? So I have a a blog post on this as well. You'll hear me keep saying that throughout this thing. but SEO can only only hurt your ads. Sorry. Ads can only hurt your SEO other way around. They can never help your SEO. so what Mediavine does is we do what we can to get out of the way. so if you are running mediavine, It has awesome. We love you. make sure you go into your ad settings and turn on optimized ads for page speed on both desktop and mobile. What that's gonna do is it's gonna get all of your ads out of that first screen view, make your site load lightning fast. Google hates ads in the first screen view. In general, they wanna see content there. unfortunately, kind of traditional methods of advertising was all about called ATF or above the fold, and ads were considered more valuable in the first screen view. So historically, a lot of ad management companies love to load up your site with ads in the first screen view, Google and users don't like that experience. It's your first presentation to your user. don't put a lot of ads there. so using the feature will automatically remove them. If you had any of them with Mediavine, we don't typically do those. everything we do at Mediavine follows what's called the Coalition for better ad standards. so make sure if your ad provider is not named mediavine, that they're following is kind of CBA guidelines. That's what Google uses to determine how much, basically, how much the ads are impacting the user experience As long as you're following those standards, who will be okay with your site, and Mediavine settings will never let you kind of violate the CBA guidelines. Another fun fact about Mediavine, we have an SEO optimized video player. So if you are with mediavine, use the video player. it doesn't just make you a lot of money. It's optimized for SEO. the video player outputs what's called schema dot org, or JSON LD. So you can actually appear in Google video search results. So Google has carousels and little interludes throughout their search results, and those are kinda like only if you're you're only eligible if, let's say, your recipe and a recipe carousel or they have video carousels, if you do video, Mediavine video player will turn that post into a video post eligible for all new places for you to rank. so if you're doing video, use this, YouTube itself doesn't even output that stuff by default for you, but the Mediavine video player will. And if you're not with us yet, we'd love for you to be. If you've had at least 25,000 sessions in the last 30 days according to Google Analytics, apply at Mediavine, some other fun SEO stuff that mediavine has that people may not know about. so we also create WordPress plugins, that are built with SEO in mind, including create. And this allows you to basically take your content and present it in templated way for users. food bloggers are very familiar with these as recipe cards, right, recipe cards at the bottom of food blog or Now how two cards at the bottom for kinda like craft bloggers. Those are marked up in steema that, as I was saying before, they make you eligible for results such as the recipe carousel, or the new how to markup on mobile, it gets you a lot more screen real estate in the Google search results. It won't necessarily improve your rankings but it will improve your clicks. And at the end of the day, all that matters, did people click to your site? so this is gonna be a huge SEO boost to use to create, and it's not just for food bloggers, not just for craft and how to. We have things called lists, new things called coming out called indexes, where create can be used by all different types of bloggers. try it out. Everything is optimized for page speed, optimized for SEO, user experience, and they're pretty darn beautiful. So if you're not running create, consider it whether you really what any anything you've logged out. Okay. This is something we've been talking about for over a year. I'm not sure if people are familiar with trellis, but is our WordPress theme framework we're developing with? A lot of people run, like, Genesis based themes. You can think of trellis as a replacement for Genesis, but also it's your built in speed optimization plugin. Perhaps you've heard speed matters quite a bit for SEO these days, and trellis is built with that in mind. so you're not gonna need to run 8,000,000 different optimization plugins, like your lazy loading and your image compression and everything that optimizes your JavaScript and all the stuff you probably have installed over the years to speed up your site. Mhmm. Trellis kinda demolishes all that. builds from the ground up a super fast lightweight theme that has all that stuff built in. Mediavine will also be releasing child themes in addition to custom built themes by developers. Mediavine child themes will obviously be adoptimized and built for page speed. child themes will be priced very reasonably in the media line marketplace. We're excited, beta testing is beginning on this in February. so, hopefully, if you haven't signed up for the beta should be reaching out to you guys soon. So, Charles, is really happening, and it should hopefully change page speed for everyone. Our goal is 99 with running Mediavine Create, Treliss, ads, and [inaudible].

Liz Stapleton [00:42:05]:
Yes. Feel like most people are most familiar with this one.

Eric Hochberger [00:42:09]:
Yeah. funny enough, a lot of you guys are already running it because we acquired social pug. Yeah. And social pug. got a very big boost after, a little social warfare debacle earlier this year and a couple other plugins that got hacked. we love social pug, and we want to make it the best social sharing tools that are out there. right now, the plans we're optimizing for page speed because that's what we're obsessed with. social sharing tools in general, slow down sites, more than you would realize. Every little piece of JavaScript, you add to your site to power your Pinterest counts or your Facebook counts are slowing down your site. Social pug in an awesome job and that kind of behind the scenes, it talks to Facebook, gets your account, talks of interest, gets your account. So it already does a lot of the page feed stuff right. It's further optimizing it. So if you are running grow and you have the paid version, Go into your settings and turn on the optimize for page speed mode. it'll already speed up your site today, and we're working on adding more and more features speed up grow even more, so it has no impact on your page speed. So you can have it all. Social sharing end speed. And then finally, we're gonna be adding opt in So a lot of people right now run kind of what's called 3rd party JavaScript are basically They they rely on something like an opt in monster when you call opt in monster and it bodes kind of like the opt ins. Those are incredibly slow. one of the things we're focusing on with Grow is gonna be doing, again, the same way that social pug did it where everything's hosted locally and fast. We wanna do the same thing for your opt ins. So we believe opt ins can be fast too. That's coming soon. Final thing, if you enjoyed this talk, and you wanna hear more me rambling, come join us in Baltimore. great chance to network in person with a lot of your bloggers, and continuing a lot of the topics you're learning here, at the Mediavine conference in Baltimore. Plus, it's a lot of fun. we have a 10% off coupon breakthrough 10 for anyone listening. So I don't know.

Liz Stapleton [00:44:10]:
No. That's, thank you. yeah, I guess, I mean, I love virtual summits. I love, you know, all the knowledge you get to gain, and we do have a Facebook group that helps you kinda get to know other people, but in person summit or in person conferences, Like, that's how I actually met a lot of the speakers or, you know, people I connected with that connecting me to other people for speakers for this summit, and, you know, I've found a lot of really great sort of blogging friends because a lot of times when you're a blogger and like your family doesn't get it, so So, yeah, and, you know, I'm I'm a big fan of in person conferences as well. so so thank you for that discount code for attendees. That's that's awesome. any final words or anything else? That was a great session. I know a lot. I learned some things. I was taking notes. So thank you. But any any final words of advice or anybody?

Eric Hochberger [00:45:01]:
No. I think just honestly that mantra that mantra of, like, zoom out, don't stress SEO is not as hard as you think it is. you don't have to hire someone to do an audit on your site is literally just developing a good content strategy and remembering these basic principles. Google has this awesome thing called the starter guide, Google SEO starter guide, you know, some, like, webmaster blog They try as much as they can to interact with us and tell us what to do. We all like to ignore them and go to experts. Don't listen to Google. I have a little series SEO, like a CEO that the name of this title is gonna be my SEO series on the Mediavine blog and YouTube channel, kinda be breaking down a lot of these topics and easy to digest formats, but in general, I'm just taking what Google tells us and telling it to you guys. You can do it yourself. Listen to me. gladly talk to you guys for a thousand words in article

Liz Stapleton [00:45:52]:

Eric Hochberger [00:45:52]:
Yeah. -- stock SEL.

Liz Stapleton [00:45:54]:
Alright. Well, awesome. Thank you so much for your time. Really appreciate it. And, hopefully, everyone else got as much out of this as I did. So thank you.

Eric Hochberger [00:46:03]:
No. Thank you. Alright.
