[00:00:13.310] - Nicole
Hey, welcome to Uncomplicating Contracts for Bloggers. My name is Nicole Cheri Odin. And I am an attorney licensed in the state of California. I have been licensed or ten years this year. I have my own virtual law firm, Nicole Cheri Odin Law PC, as well as an online business, Nicole Cheri Odin LLC, where I provide legal templates to other online business owners who are not necessarily ready to work with an attorney like me, one on one. But know that they need to get some basic contracts and legal policies in place for their online business.

[00:00:51.280] - Nicole
I'm married to my high school sweetheart, and we have an almost six year old little girl.

[00:00:58.390] - Nicole
So, now that you know a little bit about me, I'm going to kind of dive into all the goodness that we are going to cover today. And there are three main questions that we're going to answer. The first being, what is the contract? We're also going to chat about why written contracts are so important as a blogger or online business owner. And we're going to chat very briefly about some of the contracts that you might need in your online business.

[00:01:21.930] - Nicole
And even as a blogger. Before I launch in, though, know that everything I share is legal education and information. It's not business, financial or legal advice. It doesn't create an attorney client relationship between us, and you definitely want to chat with an attorney in your area to make sure that you're taking the right steps for you and your business. As a caveat, as I said at the beginning, I am licensed in the state of California, so everything that I share is going to be from the perspective of United States law.

[00:01:51.850] - Nicole
Alright. So our first question, what is a contract? So in the broadest sense, a contract really is an exchange of promises. So, one person promises to do something in exchange for something else from another person. And it's important to know that contracts really can be oral or written, and both can be legally enforceable.

[00:02:13.870] - Nicole
However, proving an oral contract in court can be a game of he said, she said. And to complicate things, each state actually has some different laws about what contracts should be in writing. This is called the statute of frauds. So, in my opinion, all written contracts connected to your business or your blog really should be in writing. It is one of the best investments that you can make into your business.

[00:02:42.020] - Nicole
And we're going to chat why, right now. You know, generally what a contract is. Why is it that contracts are so important, in particular, written contracts? So, the first reason really is it's protection for when something happens.

[00:02:58.660] - Nicole
Unfortunately, as a business owner, as a blogger even the question is not if something might happen, it is when whether that means you have a data breach. If you have a customer, perhaps for a digital product to ask for a refund, maybe you have somebody who disagrees with terms for an affiliate partnership. It really is the unglamorous side of being a business owner. But having a written contract in place is like an insurance policy. You can't put legal protections in place after the fact.

[00:03:28.410] - Nicole
It's an unfortunate reality. You can save yourself a lot of headache if you get the written contract in place in advance and deal with some of the what if scenarios. In that same vein of thinking, you're saving yourself time, money and a headache by having a contract in place ahead of time. Because you are minimizing your exposure for somebody bringing a claim against you. And having clearly written contracts really does limit your liability and protect you from undue risk, because you are dealing with some of those things in advance.

[00:04:05.310] - Nicole
So, like I said, you can't put legal protections in place after the fact, and it can become so much more expensive when you realize, oh, I need a Booboo or there's something that we need to clarify.

[00:04:17.010] - Nicole
So, you're now going back to clean up the issue and also putting things in place going forward. So, if you make the investment ahead of time and base these things head on and get your written contracts in place, you really are saving yourself time, money and the huge headache.

[00:04:34.690] - Nicole
One of the biggest reasons for having written contracts in place is to protect your income. And that is, even as a blogger, so, written contracts really do outline boundaries. They provide clear written expectations for your clients, for your customers, for your affiliate partners, for your business partners, whatever it may be. At the end of the day, we all like to go the extra mile for our clients, our customers, our readers. But having clearly drafted written terms that you can revert back to if an issue arises, which really is when, right.

[00:05:07.970] - Nicole
We talked about that can save you a lot of trouble, and it will protect your income in the long run by making sure that those boundaries are clearly expressed.

[00:05:20.230] - Nicole
And I think one of the biggest reasons for having a written contract in place, aside from protecting your boundaries, is really actually increasing what I like to call your street cred as an expert in your industry. So, if you think about your own experiences with other people in the online space, other entrepreneurs, perhaps ones that you admire, perhaps ones that you don't, especially, ones that you have actually purchased a product or service from. If they have their legal expectations, they're written contracts in place, you probably feel a lot better about the experience.

[00:05:53.090] - Nicole
And let me give you a tangible example of this. 

[00:05:55.320] - Nicole
So, let's say you are looking to hire a business strategist as you're launching your blog as you're adding digital products and you get a couple of referrals. You chat with one who simply sends you a PayPal link and says, here pay this and we'll get started. You chop another one who actually sits down and provides you with a clearly defined written contract that outlines all of the expectations, what you're going to pay? How many sessions you're paying for? Can you ask for a refund? Can you reschedule sessions?

[00:06:25.410] - Nicole
All of these things that you kno wmaybe you may not be thinking ahead of time as you're entering into the relationship, but questions could come up. You're probably going to feel more comfortable going with the business strategy who sent you that clearly written contract because all those expectations are outlined. So, when you have written contracts and policies in place, it actually improves your clients and customers experiences. It makes you look more professional. It makes you look more polished, more put together, and that in turn increases your street cred.

[00:06:54.800] - Nicole
As an expert in the industry, which really is priceless. And the fifth reason for having written contracts in place as a blogger, as an online business owner is really to boost your confidence. So it is human nature for us to take a huge side relief when we know something's been dealt with. And then we're able to turn and focus our attention on other parts of our business, you know such as launching a new course or collaborating or signing a new affiliate. You can actually translate this into an increase in profit and exposure for you and your business because you're not bogged down with these kind of what if legal scenarios.

[00:07:34.690] - Nicole
So we chatted about what a contract is.

[00:07:37.120] - Nicole
We chatted about five reasons why it really is important to have written contracts and legal protections in place for your online business in your blog. Now let's chat about some of the contracts to consider for your blog and your online business.

[00:07:51.970] - Nicole
The first and probably the one we're going to spend the most time on is a Privacy policy. So, if your website collects any personal information, you are actually legally required to have a Privacy policy. When I say personal information that includes the all elusive email address as we work to build our email list, but also things like first and last name, telephone number and really anything relating to a person's physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity, which is a super, super expansive definition and actually includes things like IP addresses.

[00:08:30.150] - Nicole
So on your website, all those tracking software and cookies that you probably have installed. Google Analytics, Facebook Pixel, Pinterest tag, all those fun things, those are collecting personal information.

[00:08:41.680] - Nicole
You are required to have a Privacy policy.

[00:08:46.690] - Nicole
That is because California was the first state to enact legislation, the California Online Privacy Protection Act, also known as COPPA in 2004, which makes it mandatory if a business is, doing business with a Californian resident. And here's, you know the crux of this is that we don't know where our website users and viewers are coming from. The reach of the interweb is global, which means you are more likely than not going to have a Californian resident interacting with your website. So, you're probably going to be collecting personal informaton.

[00:09:18.850] - Nicole
Hence, you need a Privacy policy.

[00:09:21.610] - Nicole
The California Consumer Privacy Act, or the CCPA was enacted in 2020, and it adds more expansive protections for consumers, which actually build on the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, which, if you are in the online space. I'm sure you've heard kicked around a time or two, which was enacted in May of 2018. And this actually makes it a requirement to have a Privacy policy if you process personal information for even one EU or UK resident. GDPR also requires affirmative consent from your website users before you can even process the personal information.

[00:09:59.120] - Nicole
And we're going to chat more about that in a minute. But this is the data Privacy kind of background behind why you need to make sure you're having a Privacy policy on your website. Because under this legislation, you have exposure for fines.

[00:10:17.620] - Nicole
Under Calaba, which was the original California legislation. It's $2,500 per violation, and each website visit is considered a violation. So, every time somebody pings on your website, you're collecting personal information. And there is not a Privacy policy, you have exposure $2,500 for violation. GDPR, which is a little bit later legislation sets sanctions at €20 million or 4% of the businesses worldwide revenue of the prior year, whichever is higher, which can be expansive as you're building your blog as you're building your online business.

[00:10:53.290] - Nicole
And CCPA, which was the most recent California legislation, has a range of sanctions between $2,500 to $7,500. And there's actually a right for consumer to bring a personal suit if you have a data breach that harms them. And this mirrors some of the language in GDPR, which also allows people to bring a private suit in the case of a data breach. So, you definitely want to be paying attention to this data Privacy legislation. The point of this chat is not to scare you.

[00:11:24.030] - Nicole
Really, if you take nothing else away, you want to make sure that you have a Privacy policy in place and know what you're doing with the personal information that you're collecting, because at the end of the day, that is what a Privacy policy is. It outlines what information you're collecting and what you do with it to consumers who are interacting on your website.

[00:11:44.650] - Nicole
Taking this a step further. So, I mentioned earlier that GDPR actually requires your website users to affirmatively agree to process their personal information. And the word process actually encompasses a lot of things from storing, recording, retrieving, sharing, so, really, anything that you are doing with people's, email addresses, names, date of birth, whatever it may be, you're processing personal information. And if you think back to all of the websites you've visited since 2018, I'm sure you've seen a cookie pop up a time or two, and it's not the cookies that you eat.

[00:12:18.280] - Nicole
It really is a little banner that pops up and says, yes, I agree to the cookies on this website. And that is because as I mentioned, those third party cookies and trackers on your website like Google Analytics, Pinterest Tag, Facebook, Pixel.

[00:12:30.820] - Nicole
All those things are collecting data from people who are interacting on your website and they have to be giving their consent to you in order for you to collect that. It is required before you can even start the collection process. So, again, if you take nothing else away from today's chat. As a blogger, you definitely need to be cognizant of data Privacy legislation. You need to understand its implications in the online space and that you need a Privacy policy. You need to be using a cookie consent pop up because all of those lovely trackers, beacons, and third party cookies cannot be activated until you have your website users consent. And you want to make sure you have an understanding of what you're doing with the information that you're collecting to begin with.

[00:13:18.370] - Nicole
So, I know that was a lot in terms of Privacy policies and data Privacy legislation, but let's chat a little bit about terms and conditions for your website. So, these are also known as terms of service, and they really are the ground rules for what your website users can and can't do with your website. They outline things like limitations of liability and disclaimers, which we're going to chat about in a minute, how and where disputes are going to be handled if one arises, third party and affiliate links, which we're also going to chat about in a minute.

[00:13:47.410] - Nicole
Interestingly enough, unlike the Privacy policy, they are not legally required, but there's a, but they are the first place a court will look to if you have a dispute with somebody who uses your website.

[00:14:00.430] - Nicole
So, having terms and conditions in place for your website really is kind of a gold star business practice. And much like the Privacy policy where you are actually supposed to obtain affirmative consent from website users to agree to the collection of personal information. And that really does require them to perhaps check a box, click a button in terms of that cookie pop up and at the point of collection on your website. I actually encourage online business owners and bloggers to link their terms and conditions as they link their privacy policies.

[00:14:34.960] - Nicole
This is known as a quick wrap in internet law. This is better than just sticking them in the footer of your website because it actually creates an affordable contract. So, you have a better chance of showing that they were aware of terms for your website and at least understood them because they went through the motions of clicking.

[00:14:53.320] - Nicole
I agree, before they're able to even interact with your website or the content on your website, whatever it may be. Disclaimers, I always, always, always, say you should be including those in your terms and conditions. Disclaimers really do, at the end of the day, deny responsibility. They tell your blog, your website users, your blog readers that the information you're sharing is informational and educational. And this is especially important if you are blogging or sharing content about a regulated industry. So, think the food industry, medicine, finances, health, even the legal industry.

[00:15:32.310] - Nicole
I mean, I gave a disclaimer at the beginning of the presentation. You'll see that on people's websites, they may have a separate footer for disclaimers outside of the terms and conditions. They may even have the disclaimers posted multiple places near content on their website. Disclaim, disclaim, disclaim. I am an attorney, so.

[00:15:51.780] - Nicole
Obviously, that's kind of my posture in terms of making sure that you are protected. But having your disclaimers incorporated in your terms and conditions and having your website users agree to those terms and conditions affirmatively before they're interacting with your content again goes a long way of creating an enforceable contract versus merely just sticking the disclaimer on the footer and never dealing with it. It helps them in your exposure. So, just a little friendly tip today. A particular disclaimer that I wanted to chat about today is the affiliate disclaimer.

[00:16:26.270] - Nicole
So, if you are sharing affiliate links on your blog or in your content i.e. you are receiving a commission anytime anybody uses that link, you have to disclose that to your website users. And your disclosure has to say that you're an affiliate and you receive a commission if they use that link. I always say you should also include your affiliate disclaimers in your terms and conditions. Again, if they're affirmatively agreeing to the terms and conditions, you have a better chance of showing you have an enforceable contract, but you should also be including it in any blog post or any content that you share your affiliate link in.

[00:17:02.610] - Nicole
This is because the Federal Trade Commission or the FTC actually plays a huge role in affiliate marketing.

[00:17:08.710] - Nicole
They're protecting consumers just like you and me from false and misleading advertising. We are bombarded on a daily basis with recommendations in the online space. And so, the FTC really does lease these things to make sure that you're marketing in a legit way in a legit manner. And it's not sneaky in terms of getting people to click on things and receiving a commission by recommending products you maybe don't stand behind, but you're trying to get the affiliate commission. So, don't think that you can ignore this piece.

[00:17:40.750] - Nicole
You definitely want to make sure that you are very clear and very prominent if you have affiliate links that are being used in your blog post and in your content.

[00:17:48.650] - Nicole
Alright. So, we chatted about the ever important Privacy policy. We chatted about terms and conditions or terms of service for your website. I also want to mention terms of use because so many bloggers have an online business with their blog, and that could be by selling downloadable products like digital products such as my legal templates. It could be offering ecourses.

[00:18:08.170] - Nicole
It could be offering a membership, some sort of digital products. You want to make sure you have terms of use in place for your customers or clients to agree to prior to purchasing. These are very similar to terms and conditions in that they outline the rules of the road for how people can use your products. So, they are going to contain those ever important provisions such as your payment policy, your refund policy. Again, if a dispute arises, are you going to court? Are you mediating?

[00:18:34.850] - Nicole
Are you arbitrary? Whatever it may be, that dispute resolution language is in there, they are key if you are selling digital products. And you definitely want to make sure that in the checkout process, you're having your customers agree to both your privacy policy and your terms of use prior to putting in their purchase information, again, recreating, enforceable contracts. And make sure that they are checking a box or pushing a button that says I have read and I agree to the Privacy policy to the terms and conditions and keep records.

[00:19:09.150] - Nicole
That is one thing I cannot stress enough, especially for newer business owners.

[00:19:14.480] - Nicole
A lot of times people will think that everything is just kind of contained within the website. Make sure that you are actively taking steps to create some other form of written record somewhere in case something happens with the website. So, you can go back and you know support that somebody actually did click a button in order to be able to proceed to the next stage to make the purchase.

[00:19:40.230] - Nicole
So, with terms of use, one other tip that I want to get before I move on to guest blog post release is, it's actually very beneficial as part of keeping records to actually create a screenshot video of yourself going through the checkout process, and update that any time your checkout process updates. But actually showing what it looks like to make a purchase from your online store from selecting it, putting in the cart, going to the checkout page, having to click that I've read and agree to buttons, maybe try it without clicking them and have the error message pop up that shows it.

[00:20:12.340] - Nicole
Then click the buttons and then proceed and keep the MP4 file, or however, it is that you save that video somewhere with the proof of your clients purchases. It's just a great thing for you to have in your tool bag in case you does come up with a potential or past client or customer down the line.

[00:20:32.000] - Nicole
You can revisit that and show that look, it really is required to agree to these terms prior to purchase. So, you click them and you agreed and this is kind of what's going to apply in how we deal with the issue. Alright, moving on to Guest blog post release. So, if you are going to have guest bloggers on your blog, you definitely want to make sure you're having them execute a guest blog post release. And that is because that blog post that your guest blogger is creating is actually their copyrighted material.

[00:20:59.970] - Nicole
So, under copyright law, you are granted legal protection for what's called an original work of authorship fixed in any tangible medium of expression, which basically means at the time that you actually create something, aka you type that blog post, aka, you take the photo for the blog, whatever it may be. The Copyright attached at that moment of creation. And so, in order for you to then have permission to use that copyrighted material, enter the guest blog post release that gives you the license to use their post, and it also outlines those expectations in terms of are they being compensated for use of that post.

[00:21:40.450] - Nicole
Do you have the right to edit their post? Do you have the ability to potentially just decide that you don't want to post it at all? Are they providing images?

[00:21:47.990] - Nicole
And if so, do they have the copyright permissions for the images that you're sharing? All those types of expectations are clearly outlined, and it's definitely something. Again, you want to keep records of in case you do have a copyright and version of claim come up down the line, which is beyond the scope of what we're chatting about today. But really, it is a great projection to have this release in place. So, just a quick reminder.

[00:22:11.110] - Nicole
This is not an exhaustive list of contracts that you will need as a blogger or in your online business. But if you have a privacy policy, you have terms and conditions for your website. You have terms of use in place for any digital products that you sell, and you're using affiliate disclaimers and disclaimers in general, as well as a guest blog post release if you have guest bloggers. You're well on your way and you can definitely chat with an attorney in your area to make sure that you're using the contracts that you need in your online business.
