Hey, guys, I'm really excited for this next session with our speaker. She is a project manager and just all around sort of back in business genius. And I'm excited to ask her some questions because I know there's some things I've struggled with as I've grown, so let's give a big, warm welcome to Tressa Behiem. Tressa, thank you so much for being here.

[00:00:32.630] - Tressa
No problem. I'm excited to chat with you today.

[00:00:35.730] - Liz, Host
Yes. Because it's funny when I hired my first VA, it was almost like I need her to train me on how to work with a VA. Right.

[00:00:45.790] - Tressa
I hear that a lot. Yeah.

[00:00:47.870] - Liz, Host
Because business owners were always, like, doing everything. And so when we get to the point where we can actually outsource, it's a struggle. I guess the first question I have is, what do you see as business owners biggest struggle as they're growing and scaling and trying to work with others?

[00:01:03.990] - Tressa
So, I would say one of the biggest struggles is so many of us started a business, not necessarily to have a team. Right. We started a business because we wanted the flexibility or we wanted to kind of be able to do our own thing. And then as the business grows, you realize, oh, wait a second. I can't actually do all of this myself. And I need people to help me. But how do I find those people? And how do I train those people? And how do I manage those people? And you know you might be really good at blogging or creating products or coaching. But managing people and managing projects is a very different thing. And so, you kind of get into this spot where you're like, I need to focus on doing the things I'm really good at. But I also need these people to help me, and I don't really know how to get them to help me. Right. So, that tends to be one of the biggest struggles that I noticed. And people just don't know where to start, and then they don't know how to continue once they kind of get started.

[00:02:07.180] - Liz, Host
Sure. So where would you recommend people start?

[00:02:10.530] - Tressa
So, it really depends on your business, and it depends on what it is you're deciding to outsource. So, you know some people will start with a VA. Some people will start with an OVM like me, and then some people will start with someone who can do the same type of work that they do because they have too much client work or something like that. And so, it really depends on what the biggest need in your business is. But what I always recommend when people ask me this question is, what is going to help you grow your revenue as efficiently as possible? Right. So if you're drowning in admin and you need more time to work on revenue generating activities in the business, you're probably going to be best served by hiring a VA who can help you with some of that admin. If you're more sort of drowning in, I have way too much client work to do and not enough time to do it, or I have way too much writing to do, you might want to hire somebody who can help with that particular skill set. And then when people tend to need an OVM like me, it tends to be more that they have a lot of I don't want to say arms of their business, but they might have a lot of different things.

[00:03:35.500] - Liz, Host
Like maybe they have courses and they have products and they have coaching and they have several different, yeah. So, it's like you have to manage different revenue streams, and that means typically you need to have different types of marketing. You need to have all these things. And so that's where a project manager and OVM will come in because they can take a lot of that off your plate.

[00:04:03.730] - Liz, Host
Okay. So, how do you look at the overwhelming amount of stuff that many bloggers business owners have and decide? Okay. What do I want to maintain ownership over and what can I delegate.

[00:04:17.050] - Tressa
So, again, it kind of depends.

[00:04:20.190] - Liz, Host
Sure. That's always going to be the answer.

[00:04:21.640] - Tressa
But yeah, you're going to hear me say that a lot. But again, typically the best thing to do is start with a plan. Right. Look at all the different things that you have currently on your plate. One of my favorite exercises to do with clients is using the Eisenhower matrix, so we can kind of look at what's important but you know not urgent, what's urgent but not important. All that four squares. Right. Because when we put everything in those four squares, you can start to see a pattern of, oh, my inbox, my customer, all my people that are messaging me and comments and things like that, like that is important because that's what helps grow my traffic. But it's not urgent. Right. And so, that tends to sometimes go by the wayside because we get a little too busy. And so, looking at what are the things that are going to help move the business forward? And what are the things that need to be done but not necessarily done by me. Right. So, a lot of times, things like responding to customer emails or responding to comments or posting your social media that doesn't necessarily have to be done by the business owner.

[00:05:42.650] - Liz, Host
It needs to be done by someone, but not necessarily the business owner or the blogger. They can create some SOPs and kind of teach somebody how to do that. So, if you start by looking at what are the things that I could explain to someone else, I could teach someone else. And that don't require my level of expertise to do, that's where you start, right. And then once you get those kinds of things off your plate, you typically have a little bit more capacity to think about some of the other things and start to be more strategic about, you know, maybe I could have a writer help me create some of my content. Or maybe I could have somebody help me with my social media. But typically, when you're first getting started, you're so overwhelmed that you know even thinking about those more.

[00:06:31.780] - Liz, Host
It's taking on something else trying to find somebody.

[00:06:34.930] - Tressa
Exactly. It feels like this is just another thing I have to do. Right. And so, starting with the sort of easiest thing to outsource is typically the best way to go.

[00:06:46.660] - Liz, Host
Okay. So, a couple of follow up questions from that and a comment. One of the best things I've ever heard was if you could find someone that can do what you do at least 80% as well, let it go. Like you don't need to be a perfectionist.

[00:07:01.060] - Tressa
Yes. Absolutely.

[00:07:02.830] - Liz, Host
But then the other thing is, you said SOP. And I feel like there's a lot of sort of corporate lingo that applies to businesses, businesses that don't really translate. They don't think about it or they're not familiar with it. And SOP is one of them. So, if you wouldn't mind explaining what an SOP is and how you go about creating them.

[00:07:22.540] - Tressa
Yeah. SOPs actually have a bunch of different names. You may have heard them referred to as SOPs, which is just short for standard operating procedure. You may have heard them referred to as a system. Right. That's another way that people will often refer to them. And basically what it is is a documented way that you do something, right. So, for bloggers, it could just be, a good example is this is how I post my blog on my website. And these are the things that follow after the blog is posted. Right. And a lot of times, you just do it because you've done it so many times, you don't even think about it. But when you try to ask someone else to do it, they sit down and they do it, you know they don't do it wrong. Right? Because typically, if you're hiring someone, they know how to post a blog, so they're going to post it. But they might not write the alt text image the way that you want them to, or they might not know that it's also supposed to be shared to Facebook and Instagram and Pinterest and LinkedIn, or wherever you share it. Right. So, if you create that system or that process, you can document everything that you want to happen so that you could hand it to someone else to do it.

[00:08:39.410] - Tressa
And it would be 80%, ideally, hopefully 100%. But the first time someone does it, they're more likely to get that 80% if they have some instructions to follow, as opposed to just I'm going to do it the way I've kind of always done it. And hopefully that's okay.

[00:08:56.830] - Liz, Host
Quick tip. As I've learned as I've created more, SOPs in my business, don't just be like, oh, I need to create an write it out, write it as you're doing it because you will otherwise definitely forget so many steps that you don't even realize are steps, like just click here or whatever you want it to be like pretending they aren't familiar with what the back end of your site looks like. They don't know where to click or whatever. That's something I've learned.

[00:09:23.110] - Tressa
Absolutely. And if you already have a VA, this is actually something that you can have them do for you. So, one of the things that clients will often do for me and for my team is we'll ask them, just turn on Zoom, turn on Zoom. Whatever you use that will record your screen and just do the task. Walk us through verbally with it on your screen, what you're doing, it'll take you a couple extra minutes, right. Because you're kind of talking through you're going a little slower, but then give us the video. We can type it up for you. And then once it's all typed up with instructions, you can just take a quick look and make sure that nothing got missed. But often that's like ten times faster for the business owner than actually sitting there and trying to type it up. If creating systems is a skill and you kind of have to know how to provide those instructions. And so, people will sometimes get really stressed about it. Like, am I doing this right? Am I giving the right details? So, just record it and then let your team be the one to actually type it up for you.

[00:10:24.750] - Liz, Host
Sure. So, let's dive into kind of the system side a little bit more because it's great to have all those SOPs. But if you can't find them or, you know, they're not all in one place, or whatever. So, what sort of systems do you recommend? Business owners have to stay organized. Stay on top of things. Things are falling through the cracks. Like, what do you?

[00:10:49.570] - Tressa
Yeah. So, this is somewhat going to be dependent on your personal preferences. Some people like to keep it really simple and you can really keep your systems organized with something as simple as a Google spreadsheet. Right. What I typically recommend is whatever you're going to do, start with having that first before you create any of the systems, because then you can train yourself to get in the habit of every time you create it, you just add it to that place, so that they never get lost. Right. So, it can be something as simple as a spreadsheet where you just maybe have a couple of tabs that have, like, marketing, you know admins, operations, whatever sort of major categories you're working on, documenting and then everything that you create just automatically automatically make sure that it gets added there. There's also lots of software, like one that's really popular is called Train you all, and they actually help you create SOPs they've got lots of templates. It kind of is a repository where you can save everything and it also gives you some guidance on how to create them. But a lot of people, you know they don't want to pay for another tool.

[00:12:00.690] - Tressa
They don't want to learn how to use another tool, and so, you know keep it simple, google spreadsheet, if you use Notion, that can also be a really great way to house them. But really, you just want to think about how does your brain work. And if spreadsheets are not your thing, then maybe don't do a spreadsheet and try something like Notion or even your project management tool, if you use one, can be set up to kind of organize them that way. Yeah.

[00:12:29.880] - Liz, Host
All my stuff can cook up all my SOPs.

[00:12:31.760] - Tressa
Exactly.

[00:12:31.960] - Liz, Host
They're like document with sub pages. And yeah. Exactly. Okay. Now we talk about systems and everything. You've mentioned finding someone. How do you find someone to help you?

[00:12:46.690] - Tressa
So, there's lots of different options. And it really depends on your comfort level, and it depends on how long term you think you want to keep this person. So, I would say the most common three ways are you can go through a service. Right. So, you can use an agency where you're hiring someone specifically from an agency that specializes in providing VA's, or social media, or something like that. You can use something like Upwork, or Fiverr, or you can post a job description somewhere and hope that your network will help you find someone. Right. Yeah. And you know all three are valid. All three have their pros and cons. But when we're talking about kind of an agency or Fiverr, Fiverr/Upwork, a lot of times, you're going to get a lot of variety in what you get. Right. You might find someone who is absolutely fantastic, and you might find someone who looks really good on paper, but then ends up not being so great. So, whenever possible, I always tell people, ask around, right. If you're in a community with a lot of bloggers, ask them, who do you know? Have you worked with anybody that's really good?

[00:14:03.700] - Tressa
Or do you know of any agencies that are really good? That's always your best place to start, because if you can find somebody who a colleague has worked with, that is really good, you're much more likely to get someone who knows what they're doing for what you need quicker.

[00:14:23.290] - Liz, Host
Yeah. And I think in my experience, Fiverr and Upwork, those are more kind of not necessarily long term.

[00:14:30.670] - Tressa
Exactly. Exactly.

[00:14:32.410] - Liz, Host
Yeah. I use them to help me with transcriptions for the summit, which for a small portion of the year is a lot. But then isn't really much of anything. And I always have them do a paid, but like a test project like here.

[00:14:45.000] - Tressa
Absolutely.

[00:14:45.820] - Liz, Host
Try you with one, and I will pay you for it, because I don't believe in having to do free work, but that way I can see what's on paper matches with the results.

[00:14:57.160] - Tressa
And that's really the easiest, fastest way to test somebody out is just give them a task that you know exactly how it should be done and roughly how long it should take to do it. And then when you get it back, you can evaluate the quality and look at it. And of course, we have to take into consideration if this is the first time they've done something for you, we don't expect it to be perfect, and we don't expect it to take exactly as long as it would take you within reason, right.

[00:15:25.250] - Liz, Host
Yeah. Yeah. Can they follow the directions?

[00:15:27.920] - Tressa
Exactly.

[00:15:28.550] - Liz, Host
Are they listening to the feedback you provide them? Are they asking questions?

[00:15:34.030] - Tressa
How painful was it to get the task done? Right?

[00:15:39.710] - Liz, Host
Yeah. And sometimes they make it through the first round, and then later it's real painful.

[00:15:46.130] - Tressa
Yes. Absolutely.

[00:15:48.650] - Liz, Host
Okay. So, I think one of the things that scares people a lot in terms of trying to bring on someone to help them is the cost. And obviously, it's going to vary widely based on the tasks and the level of experience, and you know how can people sort of prepare their mindset to figure out, okay, what am I willing to pay and what kind of results is that going to get me in return?

[00:16:15.030] - Tressa
Yeah. So, I think the first thing to do is really to look at your budget and determine how much flex room do I have? How much do I actually have to work with? And then also to ask yourself, what kind of person am I looking for? Am I looking for someone who can do this without any direction, without any management? I just need them to do the thing, right? That type of person you're probably going to have to pay a bit more because they're going to need to have more experience. They're going to need to know what they're doing, right. Whereas if you're willing to train somebody, you're willing to manage them, you're willing to support them, you might be able to hire at a, you know less experienced level. And you know typically, that means it can be a bit cheaper. And then I would also look at what is this money, this amount that I'm spending going to allow me to do? Right? For some people, that means I'm going to be able to scale my business and for other people, they're not even worried about scaling their business, they're worried about. I want to be able to take Fridays off.

[00:17:26.120] - Tressa
I want to be able to spend the weekend with my kids. I don't want to have to worry about posting or commenting or doing any of these things. And so, sometimes it's not cut and dry, like if I pay this much, I'm going to make this much. But if I pay this much, I'm going to have you know XYZ possible. Right. So, just getting really clear on how much can I afford and what are my goals? What am I trying to accomplish by hiring this person? I find to be really helpful.

[00:17:58.290] - Liz, Host
Sure. No. I think that's a great point. Because it's not always a direct ROI on what you're paying out. Your sanity is worth something. Absolutely. Okay. So, I wonder if you could give some examples of things you've seen your clients or whoever delegating that or maybe some of the easiest things to delegate and some of the more difficult things.

[00:18:25.690] - Tressa
Yeah. So, starting with some of the easiest things, scheduling your social media is pretty easy, right? It doesn't require a whole lot of skill. It doesn't require a whole lot of experience. It's just, I need you to schedule this content that I've already created, and you can hand somebody follow this schedule, right.

[00:18:45.930] - Tressa
So, something like that is usually pretty easy. Even setting up blog posts is pretty simple, right. Because we're not asking them to actually create any content. We're just asking them to take the content that's already been created and put it somewhere. Right. So, things that are repetitive, things that are done exactly the same way every single time tend to be a bit easier to delegate, especially if there's no nuance. Right. So, sometimes people will start with, oh, I need somebody to help me with my scheduling. I need somebody to help me with my calendar. And in some ways, calendar can be easy because you can kind of create structure and you can have some rules. But there's often a lot of nuance when it comes to calendar because it's like, well, I might be willing to break my rule if it's a person who got a lot of potential. Right. Or you know, oh, my kid doesn't actually have school every Thursday afternoon, it's only every other Thursday afternoon. Right. So, people often start with that, and then they get really frustrated because it's not effective. But it's because there's typically so much nuance in your schedule. It just doesn't feel that way.

[00:20:07.430] - Tressa
It feels very cut and dry to you. Something else that I find often people struggle to delegate is bigger projects. Sometimes, that's because they don't always have a clear sense of what that project is going to look like. So, they might want somebody to help them set up a webinar or a summit. Right. And they might say, oh, well, you can just help me with this, right. But if you don't necessarily know everything that needs to be done, it's very hard to have someone help you with that.

[00:20:44.830] - Liz, Host
Yeah. My VA is like, hey, I've got some time for you. What do you need? And I'm like, oh, I've got like, mindless tasks coming out of my ears where you just got to click things before me. Yes.

[00:20:53.570] - Tressa
Exactly. Exactly.

[00:20:56.290] - Liz, Host
Okay. So, we talked about, like, scheduling social media stuff. Some of these things can actually be automated with tools as opposed to people. So, at what point do you kind of make the decision to go with a tool versus a person and the cost difference, and yeah?

[00:21:11.890] - Tressa
Even scheduling your social media typically has to be someone has to go into the tool, right? And add the post I typically think about, with automation, if it's something again, that is very simple, very cut and dry, I post something on Instagram. And I automatically want it to go to all these other places, and there's no nuance. It doesn't make sense to have somebody manually scheduling on all those different platforms. Right. We would have them schedule it for us once, and then the tool would be the one to post it in all those places. But if we're talking about something again, that's a little bit more complex, a little bit more nuanced. Tools tend to be a bit more challenging, and the more complex they get, the more expensive they get. And so it starts to add up to where suddenly you have $2,000 a month in recurring charges from all the things, and you don't even know where they all came from. So, really, just thinking about what is this going to help me do? And is this actually going to save time, are typically the two things that I like to look at?

[00:22:28.440] - Liz, Host
Okay. No, I like that because I'm definitely a tool junkie. I have to restrict myself from going to [inaudible 00:22:35]  sometimes.

[00:22:39.810] - Tressa
Yes. For sure.

[00:22:40.070] - Liz, Host
Alright. So, do you have any kind of final words of advice for people that are, you know trying to step up their game, potentially working with the team, just, any final words?

[00:22:52.050] - Tressa
Being really clear on what you need. And also, what are your deal breakers, right? What are the things that just aren't going to work for you and for your business? Getting really, really clear on those before you hire is absolutely helpful, because then you know what you're looking for and you know what is not okay with you before you're in the moment. If you're in the moment trying to figure those things out, it's a lot more stressful than if, you know, X is not okay with me. So, if it happens, I've already made the decision that that's not going to work. And I want this particular characteristic or I want this particular value. And so that is really important to me when I'm looking to hire somebody.

[00:23:44.130] - Liz, Host
Yeah, that's fantastic. It's so much harder to look at it when you're in it.

[00:23:50.010] - Liz, Host
Alright.

[00:23:50.420] - Liz, Host
And I think people should follow you on Instagram. You want to drop your handle?

[00:23:54.820] - Tressa
Yeah, absolutely. It's just Tressy Behiem, so, it's just my name. If you just search that, I'm sure the spelling is going to be in the description.

[00:24:05.010] - Liz, Host
Yes. Yes. I believe the link as well will be somewhere on the page, I forget where. But yeah. Tressa, thank you so much for sharing this information. It was super helpful. I made lots of notes myself, and yeah, thank you so much.

[00:24:19.860] - Liz, Host
You're welcome. Have a great rest of your day.
