Alright, guys, I'm so excited to have Ashley Mason back for the 2024 Summit. She's been a fantastic speaker in the past. If you haven't seen her at one of our past summits, she's the founder of Dash of Social, a content marketing firm specializing in social media, marketing strategy, blogging, and email marketing. She and her team help small business owners and entrepreneurs craft and execute value-driven marketing strategies designed to establish thought leadership, grow online communities, and build connections and leads. So, perfect for the summit. Ashley, thank you again so much for coming back.

[00:00:43.240] - Ashley Mason
Liz, thank you for having me.

[00:00:45.540] - Liz
Okay, so let's dive into first, what elements are necessary when you want to create a well-rounded social media strategy.

[00:00:56.070] - Ashley
Yes, great thinking. So in terms of social media, people often think that all that they have to do is write a post, publish it, and that's it. But it really goes into so much more. So, with having a well-rounded social media strategy, it comes into doing a competitor analysis to see what others online are doing in the space that's working well for them, that might not be working well for them, and knowing where you stand and benchmark yourselves against them. It also comes down to really understanding which platforms you're using. So, just because a social media platform exists doesn't mean that you need to be on every single one. But it also doesn't mean that you should only focus on just one, i.e. Instagram. Many people are inclined to look just at Instagram and nowhere else. Having a well-rounded strategy comes down to having probably at least 2-3 platforms that you can start to build an audience on. It also involves looking at your analytics to see what's working well, and being able to use that information to imitate that success moving forward, based on what you know your audience likes to see. And then lastly, it really comes down to thinking about content that will engage, educate, inspire, and cause someone to take action through whatever you'd like them to do with your business or with your blog.

[00:02:11.440] - Liz
Alright. So, really you're looking at four different kinds of content or four different aims with whatever content you're creating. As you said, engage, educate, inspire, and take action.

[00:02:22.450] - Ashley
Yes.

[00:02:23.500] - Liz
And you mentioned try to just stick with 2-3 platforms. I mean, because it's constantly changing. There's Threads. I don't know anything about Threads, I haven't gotten on there yet. I don't know if you know anything. There's the video-based TikTok. Where do you see social media in 2024 going as it's evolving and changing, and Twitter is now X? And there was a lot that happened this last year.

[00:02:48.900] - Ashley
Yes, there definitely has been. I feel like this has been a trend for the past few years, but really it all comes down to video. I mean, people want to see the person that they'd be doing business with or getting to know face to face. Really it comes down to that human interaction. So whether that's allowing someone to hear your voice and see your facial expressions, or whether that's showing photos of yourself and being able to resonate with your audience that way. I think for a long time there was this stigma ultimately, or this preconceived notion that business had to be strictly business and you couldn't have any personal integration into that. But things have totally shifted and now people really resonate with and interact with brands that are more humanized. And so being able to incorporate more of that content into your overall presence can do a lot. I mean, an example of how that happens for me is that every time I read a book, and I'm a very big reader, every time I read a book, I post an Instagram story of the book that I'm currently reading. And that content gets the most engagement out of anything else that I post, whether it's about social media or what have you. It's like people just love to see your interests and see your passions and know who you are as a human. And that's what helps to build those close relationships that can convert down the line.

[00:04:06.880] - Liz
Well, now I have to ask, what book are you reading?

[00:04:08.830] - Ashley
So I am currently finishing up Rouge, I think it's called. I'm a very big thriller reader, so I tend to gravitate towards that.

[00:04:19.040] - Liz
Nice. Okay, back to social media and marketing and value-driven, well-rounded strategies. So, video is where it's at. I have not mastered video, especially for reels and stuff like that. Do you have any tips on how to get started with that? Any tools that make it simpler? I'm a millennial, don't blame everything on me, and Instagram is like a struggle. I feel like kids [crosstalk 00:04:47] definitely can figure out Instagram better than I can. And by kids, I mean my eight-year-old nephew probably could. So, any advice there or tips or tools, or things to get going in that way for social media?

[00:05:00.760] - Ashley
Yeah. So, I would say to think about what content you're planning can be video. So, for me, I do a lot of brain dumps for both myself and my clients, where I'll just think of a bunch of different post topics, and then I'll go through those topics and I'll identify which ones could be good video content. So first, you have to get into the habit of making to-do videos in the first place. But it really all comes down to the preparation I think. If you're not used to recording videos or not comfortable with recording videos, having a list of talking points is key. Because a lot of times when people start hitting the record button, they're just like, 'Uh', and they just don't know what to say. So, I would say having a list of talking points is crucial. But I would also say to not necessarily write up a script because it is very obvious when someone is reading word for word. And so, if you can come up with a few bullet points just to keep yourself on track, that's awesome. I also say that with video, aim towards having a shorter length compared to longer. I mean, attention spans are so short nowadays that you want to make things concise. And so, it, of course, depends on the content, that will determine the length. But I say really anywhere from maybe one to two minutes is the sweet spot, just to make sure that you're captivating your audience and ensuring that they're watching the whole thing. I would also say to use a tool like Descript, which I love. It's great for video editing, and it's also great for transcriptions and captions. Captions are a must because so many people watch videos with the sound off because videos often play with the sound off. And so, you want to make sure that people who are watching your video, who may not have their volume on, are still being able to understand the content and read along with you and you're not losing out on opportunities that way.

[00:06:49.360] - Liz
Okay, I like that. So, you said one to two minutes. I feel like stuff is going more toward a portrait rather than a landscape video, unless you're doing YouTube or something.

[00:07:00.310] - Ashley
Yeah.

[00:07:02.730] - Liz
It sounds like you're saying go ahead and just start with face to camera, chat it out content. Are there any other tools or tips you would have for other types of video content just to have that variety?

[00:07:16.020] - Ashley
Yeah, I would say definitely tips. So, one of my favorite, I guess, processes for being able to come up with post topics, whether it's video or not, is to actually think about questions and problems that your ideal audience is asking you or facing, because that can easily turn into video content, so truly answering that question. I also love to use video content to promote stuff. So, I've been hosting monthly webinars on a variety of topics, and each month I'll create just a short promo or trailer to talk about the upcoming webinar and just share more information about what's happening within it. I also think if you're someone who might be in a service-based business, if you are working with clients and are looking to have testimonials, getting them to go on camera and say their testimonials is huge and it holds a lot of weight. I think also being able to incorporate other experts or other people within your video content can go a long way as well.

[00:08:10.040] - Liz
Awesome. No, I like that. Let's walk through what the process would be. You brain dump, you come up with ideas, some that can be video. I'm assuming you batch, and this isn't a batching session, so we won't dig into that super heavily. How often are you posting? That depends on how much content you're creating, I'm sure, but what sort of consistency? And does it matter by platform? Does it matter if, 'Oh, I need to do a video one day, I post the next'? What variation do you recommend or see works well?

[00:08:48.660] - Ashley
Great question. So, I always say that consistency is so much more important than frequency. And really, that depends on the person who's creating the content. So, if you can only commit to one post per week because that's all that your schedule or your time allows, then that's fine. Because what matters is that you're showing up consistently one time per week. I think oftentimes business owners or bloggers tend to just dive right in full force and try to create all this content for every single day, and they very quickly burn out and then ditch everything altogether. So it's much better to take things slow and start off with that one to two posts per week. And then, once you get comfortable with creating more content and you are in a good groove and you have the capacity to create more content, then you can increase that cadence. So, it comes down to that, and it also comes down to what your analytics are saying. You definitely want to make sure that you're creating your content and posting your content on the days where your audience is most engaged, which every social media platform has that information for you, which is great. So, you're able to see the most popular days and the most popular times. And so, of course, you want to take advantage of that popularity and ensure that you're captivating people when they're hot ultimately. And so being able to cater your schedule to that, I think can make a really big impact.

[00:10:06.240] - Liz
Let's pause. Show me where I would find that information in a platform if you don't mind. And I'll share my screen if you want to walk me through it. We'll do Instagram, I guess, because I'm terrible at it.

[00:10:20.560] - Ashley
So, Instagram, unfortunately, it's only on mobile, so you might need to do Facebook. [crosstalk 00:10:24] 

[00:10:26.650] - Liz
Oh. Okay. So should I go to the Meta business suite?

[00:10:29.900] - Ashley
Yeah, you could. 

[00:10:32.260] - Liz
Okay, let's do that. Let me pull it up and then I'll share my screen.

[00:10:34.930] - Ashley
 Actually, Meta business suite will show Instagram, but Instagram itself doesn't have that on it.

[00:10:40.080] - Liz
Sure. Okay. [crosstalk 00:10:43] I always love a real-time this is where you find it kind of a thing. Okay.

[00:10:48.640] - Ashley
Yeah.

[00:10:49.650] - Liz
[inaudible 00:10:52] What is it? It's being weird. There we go. Okay. It's because I've got multiple screens going. Alrighty. So, you can see I don't do much at all with Facebook or Instagram. But that's okay, guys. I'm consistent with my Summit every year. Okay. So, we're looking at Insights would be my best guess?

[00:11:12.780] - Ashley
Yes. So this is perfect. So, at the top, where you'll see the last 28 days, you can actually get granular and specific about the time frame that you want to look at, which is nice. With a client yesterday, we went through the five months that I've been managing their social media, which is cool. So, if you want to look at a certain time of year, you can also compare it to a previous time of year to see how things have changed and whatnot. But if your Instagram account and Facebook page are connected to this, then you'll be able to see reach, which is the number of people who saw your posts, Facebook page likes, or Facebook followers, as well as Instagram followers and the growth there. Messaging is if people message your page. And then they also have video summary at the bottom, which is perfect because we were just talking about video, but it'll show zero 

[00:12:00.250] - Liz
Well, this is for my page, though. Okay.

[00:12:03.480] - Ashley
Yeah, it'll show interactions on video content.

[00:12:06.590] - Liz
Okay, for my Facebook page. I don't think I posted any videos. But for anyone who's not familiar, this is totally free. You can just connect yourself to it. So, is there a way to know when my audience is most active? Where would I look for that?

[00:12:23.790] - Ashley
I'm honestly not sure where it is on Meta itself.

[00:12:31.300] - Liz
Sure

[00:12:31.400] - Ashley
But I mean with Instagram.

[00:12:31.730] - Liz
I'm putting you on the spot.

[00:12:33.360] - Ashley
It's all good. Usually, I do it through Instagram, with being able to look at the times. And usually, Facebook and Instagram are pretty aligned with that. So, with Instagram, let me walk through it on my app and I can verbally talk about it.

[00:12:51.340] - Liz
Okay.

[00:12:52.420] - Ashley
So, with Instagram, you'd want to click on the Insights under your profile.

[00:12:58.302] - Liz
Okay.

[00:12:58.590] - Ashley
Then you'd want to scroll down and you'd actually want to change to the content that you shared, and then you'd be able to see the different days and times. So, it's really helpful for being able to understand when people are looking at your stuff, which is nice.

[00:13:17.290] - Liz
Okay. Yeah. So, make a habit of digging into your data, guys. I do for other parts of my business, I don't for social media, which could be part of why I don't do well on social media. Okay. So yeah. Do you have a list of data points you recommend people keep track of when it comes to their social media and figuring out the best strategy and what's working for them?

[00:13:44.380] - Ashley
Yes. So, people are always caught up in the number of followers and the number of likes, which I say both are vanity metrics. Because just anyone can follow you, but it doesn't mean that they're engaging with your content or that they're actually the right fit for your audience. Same with likes. I mean, everyone mindlessly scrolls through their feed and double taps. So, it doesn't actually mean that they're particularly interested in the content. I'd say what holds the most weight is really those more action-triggered responses. So, whether it's someone commenting on a post, whether it's someone sharing your post, whether it's someone clicking a link from your post, which you can see; perhaps someone looking at your post and then following you, that means something more. Because the fact is that your content inspired them to now stay in the loop with you. But I'd say looking at anything that inspires people or encourages people to take that next step is huge.

[00:14:37.510] - Liz
Okay. And that's going to obviously what specific analytic data point is going to vary by platform.

[00:14:45.000] - Ashley
Yes

[00:14:45.230] - Liz
So, dig into your analytics, figure out what those engagement metrics look like in the platform that you're focused on, and then have a, I like to call them data dates. And dig into that set of recurring calendar notices for yourself or something like that or your task management.

[00:15:03.310] - Ashley
Absolutely.

[00:15:04.950] - Liz
Okay. So, let me go back to questions I had. Okay. So, we talked about digging into the data, using video, engage, educate, inspire, and take action. It's really what you're trying to do. How do you reflect your business values and stuff as you do that? I don't know if you have any tips on that, because obviously if you're trying to get them to engage, educate, inspire, and take action, you want to be on the same level as them. I mean, yes, you're teaching them something, but you don't want to be hoity-toity - 'I believe this'.

[00:15:42.300] - Ashley
Yeah

[00:15:42.100] - Liz
I don't know if you have any tips for blending all those things together.

[00:15:46.670] - Ashley
Yeah. I think what really helps is sharing a client success story or something along those lines, because ultimately you want people to read content and envision themselves actually having that content apply to them. So, you want people to read your posts and be like, 'Wow, this is me', or 'Wow, I totally resonate with that'. And I think being able to have those real-life examples of someone who's gone there before can help to paint the picture a little bit better. And I think it also comes back to humanizing your content, like I mentioned earlier, where if you keep things very strictly business and very professional, I think you have that hierarchy sense that's built. And you don't want to have this power over someone. You want to be at the same level with them. And so being able to incorporate more of that human aspect, I think, can really help people to feel like they know you, like you, and trust you, which is huge for getting them to take that next step.

[00:16:41.200] - Liz
Yes, I 100 % agree with that. Like I said, every year I say I'm going to do better at my social media, and every year I just get bogged down on other things. Do you have any advice on making it a priority and actually getting it done?

[00:16:54.570] - Ashley
Yes. So, what we mentioned earlier, what you alluded to earlier, batching is key. I mean, even if you can only set one hour a week, just as long as you get social media posts done for either that week or for the following week, can really set you up in the long run. Because I think what happens with a lot of business owners or bloggers is if they say, 'Oh, I'll write this today, I'll write this today', it just doesn't happen because, like you said, other things come up and priorities come up. And so, I think being able to have a dedicated time each week that you do that is huge. I mean, for me, I actually use Thursdays and Fridays as my admin days where I'll plan my own content for the upcoming week or even the upcoming month, and that's really helpful to see. And I also recommend being able to use some type of project management system or anything like that to help you plan everything out. I personally love using Asana for mapping out my entire marketing calendar. So, actually, I finished it for the year a few weeks ago, but I mapped out my social media post each week; what my blog post would be each month; what's going in my newsletters every other week, and just had that bird's eye view, which now allows me to be strategic and intentional about what I'm posting and when, and not just posting something just to post something. Because I think that's also another thing that people do is they're like, 'Well, I got to post something. Let me just post this'. They don't really think too much about it. But I think sitting and dedicating the time to actually think about your strategy moving forward can really do a lot for you.

[00:18:20.700] - Liz
Okay, so the elephant in the room is AI, which is automating social media. And I mean, there's been schedulers and things for ever since social media started being a thing, I guess.

[00:18:34.570] - Ashley
yeah

[00:18:35.120] - Liz
What is your thought on the way you could possibly use AI to help you and ways you shouldn't? Because I think that's just as important.

[00:18:45.120] - Ashley
Yes

[00:18:45.220] - Liz
And then just thoughts on Evergreen, because I use SocialBee and there's a lot of those out there where it just re-queues things. So, there's stuff going on and it's all good content. But what is your thought in that regard in terms of Evergreen, re-queuing things, and AI?

[00:19:08.110] - Ashley
Yeah, absolutely. So, with AI, in terms of what you should not do, as I say, not use AI to completely write a post for you. Because I think what ends up happening is that unless you give a very specific prompt, then you're going to end up with content that is very clearly written by AI and doesn't really sound like you at all. I think what you should use AI for is idea generation. It's really helpful for thinking of content topics or even bullet points to go within posts that you then expand upon and write about yourself. It's also helped me with research and ideas too. For example, I just used it last week for a client where I was pulling together a Facebook ad audience for them, and I was looking for, I want to say it was people who work in theater, and I just couldn't think of demographics or interests to get more targeted. So, I went into ChatGPT. I was like, build me a Facebook ad audience that targets theater directors, and it came up with really great and helpful starting points, ultimately. I didn't use that exactly, but it helped me to think about what I wanted to do moving forward. And so, I think oftentimes as business owners and bloggers, we get stuck sometimes. And so, I think if you need some inspiration or something to get you going, it's a good use in that sense. In terms of re-queuing or using Evergreen content, I think that's definitely great if you are strapped for time and don't have the time to be able to create new content. I will say just to go through, I'd say maybe once or twice a year, maybe at the beginning of the year, or in the middle of the year to refresh it. Make sure that none of that content is old or if it's stale, if you feel like it's been reshared a lot, you could possibly swap it out. But I would say to look at that aspect, and I'd also say to just check the number of times something is shared. When I reshare something through my Evergreen, I have it set up so that the same post is not posted twice within a six-week period or something like that. You don't want people to see the same post daily, but it's definitely great for ensuring that you're staying consistent and that something's there if people happen to pop across your profiles if you don't have the time.

[00:21:15.300] - Liz
Okay. I think, last question then we'll wrap it up. Most platforms allow you to pin something as the first posts of yours people will see, or there's some sort of story type of daily thing, content that expires. Do you have any tips on the best way to take advantage of those features that exist on various platforms?

[00:21:40.900] - Ashley
Yeah. I would say the pinpost is the content that's great for explaining who you are, what you do, and how you help. Because that's the first post that people will see, you want to make sure it's something that will instantly resonate with your audience right off the bat, and validate why they're there and why they're going to your profile. I think if you're also promoting something, having it as the pinpost is great because, of course, it's that highly sought-after first thought. And so, again, people will see that right away. In terms of stories, I think that's great for showing more so, I don't want to necessarily say messy, but that off-the-cuff, behind-the-scenes type of content that doesn't necessarily need to go in your feed and have a more permanent place, but still gives people the opportunity to learn more about who you are, what you do, and how you help, again. So, for me, I love to use stories about, again, the books that I'm reading. I run a lot, so I'll post the runs that I do on Peloton. I also showcase the food that I like to eat on weekends because I'm a foodie and I like to go out to eat a lot. I'll also showcase my process for working with clients. I might show what an inside look into a social media strategy is. And so, I think just using that feature to allow people to know you on a deeper, more intimate level can again help to build those relationships that lead to some type of conversion further down the line.

[00:22:59.510] - Liz
Okay. Fantastic. Well, I will stop myself from asking more questions just because we are short on time. Where should people find you? I think you've got something for our wonderful attendees. Please share.

[00:23:12.790] - Ashley
Yes, absolutely. So, you can find me at dashofsocial.com. You can also find me at Dash of Social on Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter. And the freebie that I have is a content marketing bank where basically if you download it, you'll get access to all of this helpful information on several different pieces of content that you can create for your business or blog.

[00:23:33.020] - Liz
Fantastic, I'm going to actually make sure I get that for myself. Alright, guys. So, if you haven't been to Ashley's site or her social media, go check it out. As you can tell, she knows her stuff. I just need to get better at actually implementing the things I learned from her. Ashley, again, thank you so much for coming back.

[00:23:55.290] - Ashley
Thank you again for having me, Liz.
