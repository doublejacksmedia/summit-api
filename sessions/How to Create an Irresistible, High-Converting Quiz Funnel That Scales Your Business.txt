Liz Stapleton [00:00:00]:
Alright, guys. Today, we're going to be talking about a particular type of funnel with Drew DuBuff. Drew, welcome. Thank you so much for for being here and sharing this knowledge.

Drew DuBuff [00:00:11]:
Thank you so much for having me, Liz.

Liz Stapleton [00:00:13]:
Yeah. So we're gonna talk about quiz funnels, which I feel Everyone's probably done without realizing it, like, like, participated in, you know, not necessarily set one up themselves, but have participated in without realizing it. and it can be a really great tool. Can you so give us a little bit about how you kinda got back got into this, your background, and what we're gonna be covering today.

Drew DuBuff [00:00:36]:
Sure. So when I first started my journey into online business, I wanted, to start a career blog. career advice block. And so that's what I had started. In the process, I ended up, freelancing for some figure and 7 figure bloggers, which gave me a career in freelancing, and made me realize that I wanted to help educate people more about online business than career advice. But I had this quiz that I had created as one of my first three posts as a part of the career blog, and that quiz still performs amazingly well today. And it's gotten it's generated over, 1700 leads, since September of, I I wanna say it was

Liz Stapleton [00:01:24]:
2018.

Drew DuBuff [00:01:25]:
so just about a a year and a few months, and it's done that completely organically on Pinterest with no advertising. I haven't pinned it in over a year. so it's a system that I think is very receptive to social media. And I love how interactive quizzes are because you get to, you know, personalize and customize your results. And that's great for email marketing and segmentation and, you know, as a business owner, you can recommend products based on who, you know, that avatar is. So that's really why I love quizzes. And you you've probably seen them. They can also be called assessments, That's another fun word. You see people like Michael Hyatt have their life score assessment and, you know, he's generated 1000 of thousands of leads for his launches, through quizzes. so it's a great system, I think, for online business owners to generate qualified leads.

Liz Stapleton [00:02:27]:
Okay. Yeah. Because it's I mean, you're like you said, it kind of lets them self segment from the get go, which is -- Yes. -- great at, you know, because the more targeted you can be in your emails, the more success you're gonna see for sure. Yes. Okay. So I definitely have questions about this. I'm excited to dig in. I'm gonna let you take the lead and I will just interjective questions.

Drew DuBuff [00:02:49]:
Awesome. So I think the first question I want to address is, you know, why would you want to do a quiz funnel? Because You know, if you've never done a quiz before, you don't understand, you know, the why of it. And so I think for me, one of the biggest, reasons why I like quizzes is that it helps to segment your email audience. and this can be used at different times of the funnel, right, So you might do do something at the top of the funnel where you just wanna know what different people are, interested in. So, you know, for example, on that career quiz, I had, you know, if someone wanted to be a lifetime employee or they wanted to be a part time employee and start side hustle or be an online entrepreneur, there are different ways that you can go, and the answers would require different email sequences. So it helps the segment at the top of the funnel. Later in the funnel, you know, it can also help to qualify people for certain programs. So someone signs up to your list and you might say, hey. You know, I've got, you know, a quiz that will help you figure out, you know, what your biggest you know, struggle is right now. Maybe that's Pinterest traffic or maybe that's Google traffic. And whatever that sort of result is you can then send, you know, an email based upon their results. So it's really email segmentation, I think, is the is one of the big benefits, in many different aspects. You can also, use quizzes simply for affiliate marketing and, you know, where, say, you're a blogger in personal finance, and you are an affiliate for 5 to 10 different survey companies. And you could, you know, create a quiz that then recommends which, you know, survey company somebody should go based on how much money they wanna make the time that they're willing to invest in it. So there are a lot of different options when it comes to quizzes. And because they're so, viral and so share worthy, when you look at companies like -- Well,

Liz Stapleton [00:04:59]:
you put them together. Right. They are.

Drew DuBuff [00:05:01]:
Yeah. So when you put together

Liz Stapleton [00:05:03]:
-- I have them with 4 affiliate marketing, what I did 1 year, used in 2018 is I created a quiz of, you know, for Genius Blogger's Toolkit because it can be so overwhelming with all the products. So I created a quiz of, like, is it right for you? And if so, these are the first products you should dive into. And, you know, the value of them is over what the, you know, and so I went through it on, like, your beginner, you wanna on these ones. And they're, you know, it was possibly you were gonna get a result. I was like, you know, I don't think I think you should pass. You know? but I did that. And I I mean, I saw some, it was mostly people from my list and stuff that I'd sent to it that did well, but it didn't, like, it definitely didn't have any virality to it.

Drew DuBuff [00:05:40]:
Yeah. And I think when you look at something like the Genius Bloggers Toolkit, that's got a very limited shelf life. Yeah. And so it's only gonna work for, you know, for a limited period of time. when you do something that's more evergreen, you know, the promotion can exist for much longer. and people naturally want to share their results, especially if you could if you create a quiz that's kind of brag worthy or, you know, you do like in a like, an assessment kind when it's like, I got, you know, x, you know, out of 100. And,

Liz Stapleton [00:06:13]:
you

Drew DuBuff [00:06:13]:
know, people like to show off on social media. especially Facebook. that's so much on Pinterest, but, that's it. It's a great way to, you know, encourage people to so actually share, which brings more awareness and free publicity. And you could even counter that if you did decide to pay, to advertise your quiz, which I haven't done yet. All these results are organic. but it's definitely an option.

Liz Stapleton [00:06:38]:
Definitely. Yeah. No. I I like the idea of doing it evergreen. I'm already with those couple examples you gave, I'm already, like, thinking of ideas Oh, I could. You know?

Drew DuBuff [00:06:47]:
Yeah. Yes.

Liz Stapleton [00:06:49]:
But, yeah. Okay. So how so that's kinda how you got certain why you like them. but how do you actually, you know, decide on a quiz? You know, because there's a lot that goes into it. Like, it's one thing to take quiz, another to build it out and the, like, you know, calculations of how they get what results. So how do you go about that? How do you sort of decide what your quiz is gonna be on?

Drew DuBuff [00:07:12]:
I think the first thing that you have to look at is what what's your objective with the quiz? Is it to get an affiliate sale? Is it to promote your own products? Is it, you know, to segment your audience by interests? And then you can work, you know, around that. way. so for example, you know, if you blog about side hustles, you might wanna create what we call, like, a branching logic quiz where you branch people into different apps based on the answers that they give at each stage, you know, that could result in, you know, bookkeeping or that could result in, a virtual assistant or freelance writing, then you could send personalized results that way. That kind of a quiz, you'd you'd you'd know what the objective is. You're gonna push an affiliate offer or helpful guides on your blog. And so then you'd be like, you know, what kind of side hustle, you know, should you pursue? But maybe you'll make it a little more, fun to play with and, you know, play on different archetypes. And I don't necessarily not necessarily stereo types, but typical behavior patterns, and you could say, you know, like, design a red carpet dress, and we'll tell you your new side hustle. Right? Something that's much more fun, and you could still make those parallels, like someone who might like a more structured dress might be better you know, for accounting because there's, you know, it's very linear like that. You know, someone, that likes to have fun and is very visual might be better, you know, as a Pinterest VA. So you can toy with your quiz, conception, and ideas based on the outcome that you want. And so it really works best to start from the end first and then work your way backwards. And I would actually write you know, your, at least your initial results. It doesn't have to be the full results page, but know where you want to go because then that will determine the kind of quiz that you want to create.

Liz Stapleton [00:09:15]:
Okay. No. I like that, and I still need to create a side hustle quiz from my other site.

Drew DuBuff [00:09:21]:
Don't steal my ideas.

Liz Stapleton [00:09:23]:
I have. And I did a whole summit on side hustles for that site, though. I'm like, I could just lead them to the particular session of the summit.

Drew DuBuff [00:09:31]:
Yeah. It it it really it it's a concept that I think really works.

Liz Stapleton [00:09:34]:
Yes. For sure. I promise. So it'll be different from yours.

Drew DuBuff [00:09:38]:
Yeah. Yes.

Liz Stapleton [00:09:40]:
I'm not looking at it from for affiliate things. Anyway, okay. So I did wanna ask. We'll we'll dig into setting it up more in a second, but you mentioned full results page. So what does a full results page look like? Like, what all are you including on that? Do you and kind of a joint question, do you require the email address before they see the results page?

Drew DuBuff [00:10:00]:
That's a that's a great question. And I think a lot of it depends on what you want your results to be and what you want the objective of the quiz to be. I personally ask, for the email before the results because they're invested in the process And so chances are they wanna know what the result is. I also, I currently on that on my career quiz, I don't ask for, a first name. I just want the email address because the more that you ask for, of course, there can always be a dropout rate. But, it's okay to ask for a first name and an email. I just wouldn't ask for more than that. but I I -- You

Liz Stapleton [00:10:40]:
already have the quiz data.

Drew DuBuff [00:10:43]:
Yes.

Liz Stapleton [00:10:43]:
Right? Because cert certain quiz tools can let you actually tag people based on what they did in the quiz. Right?

Drew DuBuff [00:10:50]:
Yes. Exactly. and so some quiz builders have free options where they won't allow you to collect emails. That's kind of a limitation. but a workaround that you could do is include something like an opt in form on an announcement bar in your site, and then they could say take the quiz, and they've already subscribed. So you could do it that way. You just wouldn't be able to personalize their you wouldn't be able to segment them because if you're not collecting subscribers, you

Liz Stapleton [00:11:17]:
can't segment.

Drew DuBuff [00:11:18]:
Yeah. So it really does, work best, I think, before the results. But in terms of the results pages themselves, I've seen anywhere from short results pages to longer results pages, you know, if you're taking if you're doing a quiz that is going to be more fun in nature and it's going to be short like, that career quiz that I have, you know, it's gonna have a shorter results page just because people wanna know. They wanna know a little bit about themselves, and then they're done with it. I'm trying to sell them on anything. I just want them to sign up for my list to be, you know, aware of these things. it you do get to put, like, a button, a CTA call to action button. So if you have, like, an opt in, you know, that you wanted them to see tailored based on the results. You could put that there. and then what I do is you can set up goals in Google analytics to track you know, the the number of conversions that you get, from people who are, you know, clicking

Liz Stapleton [00:12:18]:
-- -- session on that?

Drew DuBuff [00:12:20]:
Yeah. Yeah. Fun. Cool beans. so that's, yeah, so that's great. and there are also more long form results pages, almost like, to the length of sales pages because some people, you know, the way that their quiz is set up is they really want to get you to know them. Like, this is your virtual introduction a lot of times if it's the top of your funnel, And so if you know who your reader is, then you can personalize it and, you know, really expand upon know, the results of that. So while, you know, you might not wanna write that much about a survey because they just wanna sign the survey and start making money, you know, if you are doing, you know, like, a a side hustle, you might want to expand on what being a virtual bookkeeper is. And, you know, the fact that you don't actually need to know tax law that you just need to be able to manage you know, books and to do calculations and things like that. So it it you can take an educational perspective and make it long form if it's if it if it's right. And it won't be right in every time. So you have that flexibility with quizzes that I really like.

Liz Stapleton [00:13:34]:
So let's go ahead and dive into sort of, like, setting one up in different tools you can use. and if you don't mind screen sharing, like, an example or something we can kinda dig into that stuff.

Drew DuBuff [00:13:46]:
Yeah. Sure. so I personally, I use a company that's called, Interact. there are a few different kinds of, companies, and I'll have, a link for an exclusive coupon through there if you do want to get started. but there are a few other companies, companies like, lead quizzes and bucket IO. I just find that, interact is really friendly, for bloggers. And that's kind of why I like it. It allows for email segmentation right within, you know, the results page and the quiz builder itself. So it it's simple. And I think it's very, user friendly, and that's really why I like it. so, yeah, so we can absolutely check out, that quiz. And we can show you kind of what the anatomy of the quiz would be. Does that sound good?

Liz Stapleton [00:14:43]:
Yes. Let's do it.

Drew DuBuff [00:14:45]:
Perfect. So let me share my screen. Alrighty. So we should be. So right here. So can you see this, this quiz right here?

Liz Stapleton [00:14:55]:
I can. Yes.

Drew DuBuff [00:14:56]:
Perfect. So, as you can see here, you just got a simple title, at the top. And then share buttons are always helpful so people can, share your results. as you can see, this has been shared close to a hundred times on, Pinterest from here. and then what I have here is the quiz is embedded. it does have a bunch of bottom, but that's for mobile users so that doesn't cut off. You don't have to scroll, which I think really helps. And then, I have branding at the bottom. some quiz builders on the free plans won't allow you to customize the branding, but It's an option for more of the, the paid plans. Yes. you get a simple, title. I I think that simple works best unless if you're trying to do something fun, you know, like I was saying about, you know, design a red carpet dress, you know, and we'll tell you x, y, z. Yeah. Something simple, something readable. You can have a nice image here. and then you've got this little description and this can work well when you're promoting it on social media as well. it can be like the copy. You know, so I have does your job frustrate you. You might not be realizing your potential. Take the quiz to discover your true career best. Yeah. So just a few sentences. You don't want it to be too long. and then you'll have the button to start the quiz. And it's nice to have, like, a customized CTA button, like, you don't just wanna say, you know, start here or take the quiz, you know, create something enticing. So I have Discover my desk today. any questions so far on the title description?

Liz Stapleton [00:16:44]:
No. I think that's great.

Drew DuBuff [00:16:46]:
Great. so after this, you'll get, questions. And there'll be this little progress tracking bar at the at the top here. I find that's helpful for people because that allows them to see, you know, how far along so they don't quit. because I'm sure you've taken quizzes from Facebook that were, like, 30 questions, and you just want it to end and get your result. And it doesn't. So this helps you to track it. And in general, I would try to not have more than 15 questions. I find that, like, 7 to

Drew DuBuff [00:17:22]:
10

Drew DuBuff [00:17:22]:
is really a great, a great number. And you can, you know, of course, if your topic requires more questions, because you're trying to personalize it more, then that's fine. Just understand that people might drop off, you know, if the quiz is too long. So 7 to 10, I think, is the sweet spot. So then what we have here, you'll see is some images. You have the option to do images or just text or text and images. I like the text and images, but you can definitely break it up. because of, like, the columns, you know, if you wanted to do just text and have the results be or the answers sees me, be slightly longer, I would avoid, you know, images because then it will look very, like, "column-y", and it will know, be hard to read on mobile because that's really, like, a lot of people are taking quizzes on mobile, so you wanna optimize it for mobile. but these are simple answers, you know, what matters to you most, happiness, money, job satisfaction, and these lead in to the results that I have. What's important, to note here is that the first question and the last question generally considered more important in terms of the quiz anatomy and making sure that you get the most important questions asked answered that you want. so the last, you know, the last question before people wanna know the results. And so they think that's the question you know, that's gonna give them the right result. and then in the beginning, this can help really help you, with understanding what your audience is interested in. because based on those results, you could, you know, create content based on what the majority of your people are interested in. So, it'll go through, a very similar, path here. you know, do you wanna be your own boss? And I, you know, you can create, you know, text that and copy that fits for your audience. And that's important. You know, if you phrase where it's a certain way. If you use a certain style or look of images, include that. It should this is an extension of your brand. but this is all stock photography, right here. I don't have anything. Nothing costs them. and you should really if you are including images, they should be tailored to your avatar. So for example, the majority of my audience is going to be women. That's kind of a fact of nature on Pinterest. It's the similar on, Facebook. So the majority of my images are going to be of women. you know, in the same way that if you're targeting moms including fathers is probably not the best image choice. You want to, include images that your readers can relate to. And if they see emotions, then that can help guide them in their decision making process. So simple questions, things like this. and you can absolutely include more than 3, you know, 3 answers. I think you can do, I think, like, maybe 6 might be the maximum. but don't overwhelm you, your, quiz takers with the number of results that you have. You know, I find that keeping it simple works the best. If you have a lot of results, like, as I was mentioning with the freelance side hustle sort of thing, you'd wanna do a branching logic quiz. And that is very similar to this kind of personality quiz, except that each question that you ask get asked kind of takes you down like a branch.

Liz Stapleton [00:21:11]:
So you get different questions depending on how you answer the question.

Drew DuBuff [00:21:14]:
Exactly. Yes. So you can have 7 to 10 questions in a branching logic quiz that will result in something so much more personalized than trying to ask 15 to 20 questions to get a majority result to pop you into the right box it. Yeah. so but it can definitely help. Like, if you, you know, this quiz has, 4 results. So I thought that 3, 3 would work pretty well because there are some overlap. the move a lap. And if you do 4, it'll just kind of look awkward with, like, the 4th one.

Liz Stapleton [00:21:50]:
Yeah. Yeah.

Drew DuBuff [00:21:51]:
So keep it relative to screen size and, you know, and mobile and, you know, you people might miss options if they don't see that at the bottom. So I find that keeping it simple works. and so how do you define success? You know, having a family that loves me, finding my purpose, flying 1st class, you know, like, this very much appeals to someone who wants to be a CEO because they want that, you know, rich luxury life and, you know, having a family that loves me, you know, that might appeal to someone who wants to, you know, be a part time employee or start a side hustle so they can spend time with their baby. You know, so the images really do help to tell a story and they can help you correlate your, you know, your results, to there. and so you're gonna go through on a similar path as you take your quiz, so some people might say they're the next Lady Gaga. they've known what their dream job is since elementary school. You know, you can have fun. And so after this, you'll get, this page right here, and that's what we are talking about about, you know, the opt in before the results. and you can customize this copy right here. So you'll say, you know, you'll get personalized advice and access to an amazing library of free resources that every young professional needs. And I like saying something other than email address. You know, it could be best, you know, email or your business email or your favorite email. Something so that people don't automatically default to their subscription slash junk email just to do it. So this helps put your, your content into the right box. And so if we, do this, and we put in an email. And, again, with the customized copy right here on the button, find out my destiny. So then you'll do that. And so the answer that we got here was, part time professional. So you've got the top right here. When you share when you go to share it, it'll say, like, you got colon, you know, before the result, you don't want to include that in the actual result itself. otherwise, it'll be redundant on social media. but then you can include a nice image here. their share results. they quiz builders often include some sort of sharing embeddable widget y like things within the builder. It's self. I also have these outside because at this time, interact doesn't have a Pinterest button within their builder. I've mentioned it to them, and they said that they'd bring it up and, you know, discuss on it because I said, you know, I work with a lot of bloggers and bloggers use Pinterest. it can also help to have the quiz hosted on your site, you know, to have those Pinterest sharing, buttons. But then right here, you, can include, you know, congratulations. You're a part time professional. And this is kind of when I got to have some fun. So back when I was in college, I did a thesis on positive and negative framing on results pages for quizzes. and it was a lot of fun. definitely stressful. But what I'll say is that people tend to identify and share your results more when you frame it positively than when you frame it negatively. And so that's why it, you know, it might be a little more troublesome, you know, when you're doing, like, an assessment score and someone scores, you know, 0 25 because you're like, well, yeah. Exactly. So that's why I think that, like, personality quizzes tend to perform better. for bloggers, instead of, like, you know, well, how how much, you know, German, you know, history knowledge do you know? You know, like, this tends to work a little better. so you can have the same sort of editing options that you would have in WordPress or Squarespace or whatever your CMS is. You can do bold. You can do numbers. you know, and then this is when you can personalize it. So, you know, you have a family to take care of, so you need flexible hours. you know, cuts down on transportation costs, working from your home, here are some ideas, start a blog, work as a virtual assistant, become a freelance writer, and then I have here, you know, are you ready to ditch the traditional work schedule? Download my free side hustle checklist and work the hours you want to. Make sure you check your email inbox for instructions on how to access it, download my checklist, and that would take you to the opt in itself. And I host that right on WordPress so you can, you know, easily, navigate to it. Keep it something simple. Just, you know, a page, maybe two pages. you know, if you're doing a more long form quiz, then it might be helpful if you've got a whole persona built out and you wanted to, you know, refer someone to a

Liz Stapleton [00:26:57]:
10

Drew DuBuff [00:26:57]:
page, but that's fine. Yeah. but, you know, it's all gonna gonna depend on your objectives. So that's, quizzes in a nut shell. And I think something exciting is to then check out, you know, well, what does what are the analytics options

Liz Stapleton [00:27:16]:
and how -- -- end up having a quiz look like?

Drew DuBuff [00:27:19]:
Exactly. so right here, as you can see, I've got my for your destiny quiz. And we've got, the analytics. And so I think it's very, very, easy to navigate this. they've got a nice funnel, so you can literally see the funnel. and as you can tell, this quiz has, converted it at above 30% over the span of the year. And I think in terms of opt ins, that does pretty darn well for cold traffic.

Liz Stapleton [00:27:50]:
Yes.

Drew DuBuff [00:27:51]:
Cold traffic as ice cold as you can get. so I think that works really well. And so then you can see here based on the results, how many people, you know, are are opting in, you know, to each of these. And so I can say, oh, you know, part time professional, you know, that's, something that a lot of people are doing. Let me create more content, you know, in that arena And you can even, go and you can look at the different questions that people have answered. So you can see happiness. A lot of people think happiness matters to the most. so you might say, oh, you know, how did you might do a post on, you know, how to stay happy, you know, as a full time employee. Something simple like that. It would do well on Pinterest. And it's, you know, based on what your users, you know, have said that they want. So I think, you know, that's really, you know, when you get to have fun.

Liz Stapleton [00:28:51]:
they're inadvertently asking for?

Drew DuBuff [00:28:54]:
Yes. Exactly. And so you can see, like, the the level of engagement, you can see when people are, dropping off, you can see that dropping off is in the totals. so people are always going to drop off. I think it's helpful to see, you know, what people are saying. but that's kind of the the the gist of the analytics is really to show you this. And you can filter this based on different stuff. There's even an, advanced tab, if it'll it'll work or not? maybe maybe it'll work. I don't know. maybe it doesn't wanna work today. But, there it is. Okay. It's a fun little data, and you can see, like, where your conversion rate is over the the period of time when you know, a lot of people are opting in the number of events. So it's fun to do. It can be a little overwhelming with over a year as the That's the range, but over a span of a month or so, it can really help, for you to do that. So now if we just go in, to the actual

Liz Stapleton [00:30:02]:
-- Set up.

Drew DuBuff [00:30:04]:
Yeah. Yeah. The actual setup. and we're going to edit it. So you're gonna go directly into the, the builder. And you can create from scratch or use a template. And one of the reasons why I love interact is because they've got, like, hundreds of templates already done in different niches. So if you were a yoga blogger and you wanted to talk about you know, yoga poses, chances are there something similar or, you know, if you're a health and wellness coach, there are quizzes on, you know, shockras and things like that, and you can customize them.

Liz Stapleton [00:30:39]:
Yeah. It's always easier to start with something on the page than a blank page.

Drew DuBuff [00:30:43]:
Exactly.

Liz Stapleton [00:30:44]:
-- completely rewrite everything that was on that page. It's still easier to approach it, I think.

Drew DuBuff [00:30:49]:
Yes. The setup's done. Yeah. And that's that's, I think, that that's great. So as you can see here, we've got the cover page. You can do the title, the image, the description, and the button text. Simple. you know, nothing is overly complicated. And they've even got little, information tags here that will, you know, tell you on, like, what you know, how to write, you know, a personality quiz, and things like that. So they they share with you advice from their users' experiences, which I think can really help you in the beginning. Yeah. And, in the results, you know, you can redirect the results. You can reorder the results. You know, this is personality quiz. So, this is what, you know, if you're a future CEO, you've got all of the text right here, you can customize the button, the URL, the color. it it really has everything that you would need, and it's fairly straight forward. And that's what I like. And so when you click on a question, you know, you can add answers. You can edit. You can, use text answers, answer settings. This is a fun one. So this is like the result correlations. And this is, you know, when we're talking about mapping people, This is how they get to the results. and so you can easily drag and drop these and so I've got here, you know, like, I think people, you know, happiness is gonna correlate more to that. And, you know, I find that, you know, online entrepreneurs tend to have more job satisfaction and no suit or lifetime employees because they're in it in their company. And so you can, you know, continue on this process. And the same, and it's a similar feature if you're doing a scored quiz where it's like, you know, 0 to 100, you know, you can assign points and your results would be, you know, out of so and so, and that's already done for you. And so I think it's very simple, you know, to correlate these two things together, which I think is amazing because as a blogger, you don't wanna have the hassle of not figuring out the tech. It's, like, always a major issue. And, you know, if the tech looks straightforward, then that's better. branching logic quizzes, little more complicated, mainly because of the branches. And I think they're even on, a higher paid plan just because they're more complicated to execute. but what I find is really helpful. instead of doing this sort of stuff on the fly, map it out in a word document or on a whiteboard or on a piece of paper and know the different questions and where they're gonna correlate to so that when it comes time to build the quiz, you can just pop right in here and assign things and be on your merry way. And I think that's a much better system than doing it on the fly because then chances are you'll screw things up.

Liz Stapleton [00:33:51]:
Yeah. And I think just seeing the visual thing before you try to build it out, kind of draw it in the way your brain works as it moves the way the the whatever software you're using works will help you make sure you don't miss anything.

Drew DuBuff [00:34:04]:
Exactly. And so that's, how the quiz looks. It's what the quiz looks like. you know, the branding, you can edit this on, the paid plan. You can do conversion tracking. If it were branching logic, you could do that. the social sharing settings, if that all works.

Liz Stapleton [00:34:24]:
email marketing settings with map quiz. Yeah.

Drew DuBuff [00:34:27]:
So, if you wanna hide them, you can do the ones, the above, you know, where you wanna put the social share buttons, the social sharing link. So, you know, if, you embed your quiz, you can do that there. interact will also host quizzes on their servers. If you'd rather do just like a simple landing page, they have that as an option. And then you can also customize your image, try to use one that attracts attention. and, you know, you can, customize, you know, your results and I got and, you know, and things like that. And they tell you how they typically structure it. And a lot of this is very, straightforward. And then, you know, you got to the fun stuff. So I use ConvertKit, for my business. I really like it, and it's It's set up very well. and so you have the flexibility, you know, so, the trigger, you know, so when they get the quiz result of future CEO actions, you know, add them to the sequence of, you know, the free resource library. or, you know, if you were personalizing this further, you could have them do a specific, you know, sequence on becoming a CEO and how to up level in your industry and and things like that. You have that flexibility. Since this quiz is more off brand from my current audience. I don't customize it as much. but it still performs very well. And you can do this for each one. You know, and I think that's the important part is you could create, you know, a customized sequence for each result. and you don't have to worry about doing complicated rules or automations in your email marketing provider, it will just automatically add them to the which I think is nice. And you could even send them an introductory email that says, hey. This is your result. I'm gonna introduce you to me, you know, over the next few days, but I just wanted to let you know in case you, you know, skipped away, too quickly. and then you could send them all the same, you know, the same, about me sequence after that. And so you've just got, you know, this, you know, the quiz result as the intro coming down into the same automation. So it's something simple, but it personalizes the results further. And I think that's really, you know, the the amazing thing about this is how you know, easy it is to execute. You know, you just create these things and, you know, you do it right within the builder. No hassle, no tech involved. And you can also do, you know, custom fields, and that's a little more advanced stuff. But if you wanted to know, for example, you know, that someone was a beginner blogger or an intermediate blogger, an advanced blogger, you could, you know, those custom fields in the quiz, and then they could be embedded into your email marketing providers. So you could then send tailored content based on people who are identified themselves as beginner bloggers and conditional content. And it opens this whole wide range of email marketing opportunities that come from building the quiz. And I think that's really exciting.

Liz Stapleton [00:37:42]:
Yeah. No. I I like that a lot. I don't wanna be respectful of your time, but any kind of final tips you would, like, to to like, to add and then we'll we'll tell them a little more about the the offer you got for that.

Drew DuBuff [00:37:54]:
Yes. quiz promotion. Get your quiz on Pinterest. Get your quiz on Facebook. It doesn't have to be organic, but create a pin, you know, share it in your group boards, maybe your tribes, yes, of the quiz itself, the landing page. because as you can see right here, when you type in career Destiny, My quiz is front and center. It's the first result. I haven't pinned this that much. It beats promoted pins. And here it is right here, my quiz. And that brings in a ton of free organic Pinterest traffic, and it's not going anywhere. It's been here forever, and ever. So I think that's really great. And Pinterest users love quizzes. They wanna be engaged by the content. So if you create a good image, they will engage. And that's what brings them into your funnel. You know, so look at these different social media sources as, you know, the ways to get them into your funnel and advertise where and promote where your audience exists.
