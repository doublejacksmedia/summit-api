[00:00:09.390] - Liz Stapleton, Summit Host
All right, guys, I'm super excited for this session with Liz Theresa. She is a super amazing copywriter. Just going to her site gives me inspiration and I'm really glad that she could join us today we're going to be talking about copy for your home page. So welcome, Liz. Always good to meet another Liz.

[00:00:27.170] - Liz Theresa, liztheresa.com
I know, I know us Liz's have to stick together I feel.

[00:00:32.220] - Liz S.
Absolutely. So I'm going to let you kind of take it away. And I'm sure I will have questions.

[00:00:39.630] - Liz T.
Oh, no, I can't wait. Definitely. The more questions, the better. I'm really excited to be here. And so with that, I will kind of roll into this for you guys that know me. Welcome back. And I'm so excited to see friendly faces. For those of you that are new to the Liz Theresa brand, I'm excited to make this your first introduction because there is nothing more important than having a wicked good website. As they say here in Massachusetts. We say wicked good all the time.

[00:01:05.250] - Liz T.
So there's nothing more important than having a wicked good website to really reflect your message. And so a lot of these these copy tips, these are going to be things that you don't have to hassle your developer for. You're not going to need to shake down a designer, because as long as you can change the text on your website, these will really empower you to make sure that you're optimizing and making the most of the traffic that you get. Because let's face it, if things are like if you're like, I'm just going to like, you know, throw money onto the Facebook ads to drive traffic to my website.

[00:01:35.160] - Liz T.
And then the website isn't doing its job of converting the people into buyers and potential clients, then like, why don't you just say, I don't know set  your money on fire

[00:01:43.410] - Liz S.
You're throwing money away.

[00:01:45.330] - Liz T.
Yeah, literally like you, I just picture a big dumpster fire of money. In fact, I don't know if you saw this ornament that's been released for 2020, but it's a pink dumpster fire.

[00:01:56.070] - Liz S.
That sounds about right.

[00:01:57.120] - Liz T.
 I saw it and it's it's $20. I was like, it really should be twenty dollars and twenty cents. So I feel like I should tell them, like this occurred to me, but I don't stop even as a shopper. My brain, my brain does not stop. So my background for those of you guys new to me, I have a Podcast it's called Liz on Biz, because people tend to like that. So if you like Podcast, you can totally check it out.

[00:02:19.710] - Liz T.
I'm a copywriter. I'm a website designer. I've been doing this since 2011. So, like, I'm, I'm not I'm a dinosaur in Internet years is what you could say as far as my experience level. I love working with people that are starting and people who are scaling. So wherever you're at or whether you just have an idea on a napkin or you're like, I want to make a lot of money next year, whatever that amount is, I'm excited to know you and just kind of help people follow through on their goals.

[00:02:45.810] - Liz T.
I get so excited to talk about business. You've no idea. And copy is just the best, copy is the best tool because it's using the English language, it's something that's already at your disposal. That in, that I mean, I think people think

[00:03:01.110] - Liz S.
It's powerful,

[00:03:02.000] - Liz T.
It's powerful...But I think copy gets so overcomplicated because of things like thesauruses and people that like to sound smart. So my first copy tip, this is our bonus tip. I mean, I'm not even on tip number one.

[00:03:13.380] - Liz T.
So we'll start with a bonus tip. Bonus pre tip tip is going to be that I want you to throw out your "ologies", your "ism's" and your "ations". And so what are these ologies, ism's and ations? And they're suffixes which indicate that you're using words that you probably don't need to be using and that your language needs to be simpler. And so this is not to say that you should picture that everybody that reads your websites is like five years old, but like, I want you to realize that when something is an easy word, like if you say, Liz, I got a cat, I'm like, OK, that's that's well, that's great.

[00:03:51.630] - Liz T.
That's purrfect. But if you say, Liz, I got a feline, my brain actually has to take an extra step to process the word feline because it's not as easy as cat. It's just an example. Right. So using easy words, this is something that we should always do. That's kind of your pre tip tip. So even in the way that you communicate with clients and customers, whatever is in your autoresponder's, however you show up and talk about your business, people can smell a thesaurus a mile away.

[00:04:18.630] - Liz T.
So if you're ology-ing,and ation-ing and ism-ing you're doing it wrong, so that's number one.

[00:04:24.090] - Liz T.
That's number zero, that we're pre tipping, tip. Our number one is I want you guys to make miscommunication on your homepage impossible.

[00:04:33.960] - Liz T.
So what this is to say is that is to say, ensuring your brand message is completely visible and obvious on your homepage.

[00:04:41.730] - Liz T.
And when I say brand message, a brand message statement, so it can be a one sentence, it could be a series of sentences, maybe like up to five that describe who you are as a business, who you help and the problem that you solve. That's the thing that keeps people from going to your website and being like, oh my gosh, what am I doing here? Like, we don't want people to have that feeling of like I don't know how you fit into my world, because if they don't know how you fit into their world, you've already lost them

[00:05:09.120] - Liz S.
Yeah.

[00:05:10.950] - Liz T.
And, you know, you know, bounce rates and stuff, that's what kind of bounce rates are measuring. So if you have a very high bounce rate and for folks that are unfamiliar with the term of bounce rate,

[00:05:19.020] - Liz S.
We're going to have sessions on that. SEO and analytics and all that good stuff.

[00:05:24.030] - Liz T.
Yes. Well, it represents the percentage of users that leave immediately. OK, so so to make that number not high, we want people to know how you fit into their world and how you fit into their life. So that's why I like to say make miscommunicating your message impossible. That has to be number one if you take nothing away. There's a reason why I said it first.

[00:05:45.690] - Liz S.
Yeah. Yeah. I just I would add, like, if you're not sure, like, it's your, we're so like in our websites that we can't, we sometimes need an outside perspective.

[00:05:55.860] - Liz S.
So I would like post in one of the gazillion Facebook groups you're in, you can post in the Summit one, be like maybe I'll start a thread actually. Post your website thing and then have people to look at it and tell you what they think you're about. Right. Because you think it's crystal clear. But someone else is like, I don't know what you're talking about or it's confusing or there's too many things or so have also, actually we'll do that. We'll do a thread in the Facebook group.

[00:06:20.010] - Liz T.
Yeah.

[00:06:20.440] - Liz S.
And you guys can drop your homepage links in the comments and everyone go and just be like try to kind of help, help each other out, make sure your clear, clear message.

[00:06:29.640] - Liz T.
Definitely. There's also there was a company that used to exist. I don't think they still exist, but it was called peek user testing, like your peeking with your eyes.

[00:06:37.150] - Liz S.
There's like UserBob too. There's, there's a couple for like twenty bucks. You can get 20 people or something to like review your site.

[00:06:43.800] - Liz T.
So worth it! So interesting. Yeah.

[00:06:45.510] - Liz S.
Yeah.

[00:06:46.260] - Liz T.
Wicked interesting and then you get to see the video and there like I think I'm on this kind of website and so it's very cool,

[00:06:52.230] - Liz S.
I think it will surprise you where they gravitate to from your homepage and what they think it's about, because I've done it before and I was like, oh, like, I need to step that up.

[00:07:01.740] - Liz T.
Right?

[00:07:02.790] - Liz T.
Yeah, it's so wild and interesting. And so that's. Yeah. So that's why miscommunicating, avoiding miscommunicating your message, by the by far your most number one, important thing to do.

[00:07:13.530] - Liz T.
Number two is be super chill about your menu so like when you're thinking about your homepage menu and this should be true of all your pages, a lot of these tips will definitely overlap to influence how you approach all your pages. But specifically when it comes to your menu, I say be careful about your menu because I only want you to have five things, max. And if you go to Liz Theresa, you're going to see six. And it's because I break my own rules.

[00:07:34.710] - Liz T.
And if you're going to do, if I say five, I know you're going to do six or seven. But the fact is that the human mind can only remember up to seven things at once, so that, there is a psychological reason why phone numbers used to be seven digits and now I'm dating myself. But and also why you never want more than seven. But I'm telling you five, because in fact, the fewer choices that you give people when it comes to making any sort of decision, the more likely it is that they're actually going to, to make a decision.

[00:08:02.070] - Liz T.
It's sort of like when you're buying a product right, on Amazon, it's it can be like if you know what you're going to buy, you go to buy it and it's over. It's because well, I mean, they do they kind of do this. It's not, they're not a great example. But if you can just go, you know those websites where you can go and just buy that one product. And actually, I just bought this thing called the shift neckless.

[00:08:20.520] - Liz T.
Are you familiar with this where you breathe into it?

[00:08:22.590] - Liz S.
Nope,

[00:08:23.280] - Liz T.
This OK, it's very interesting product called The Shift, and it's I think it's called commuoso design. And essentially it's a necklace you wear to slow down your breathing for folks who have anxiety and that kind of stuff. So the way that they model their entire website, they only have one product. No wonder when people go they buy it because they're not giving you like, here's a necklace, here's a ring, here is a GPS.

[00:08:48.120] - Liz T.
And then you're like, I don't know, irony with a GPS. This GPS made be lost. And I don't know what I'm doing here in that example. So this is to say be very selective with what your top level items are. And remember too, the top level items, these when I say top level item, I mean your menu items, they don't have to represent every every page ever that you have or every page that you've ever made. You're allowed to have submenus. These things are all, I accept them. OK, but I want you to be really cognizant of the information that you choose to include, because when you aren't being really selective about that, that's when websites can be like overgrown.

[00:09:23.670] - Liz T.
Kind of like if you haven't mowed the lawn in a really long time, there's tall grass, there's weeds. It's a need of a spring clean up or fall clean up

[00:09:31.030] - Liz S.
There is a bird's nest in the grass.

[00:09:33.720] - Liz T.
Oh, that's sad. Probably. Probably in my yard. That's possible. And so, yeah, I think that that's that's probably my really important tip number two is to be chill about your menu. And just to recap, number one was make make mis-communicating your message impossible. And number two is limiting your menu to five items. And then the sub tip for that is that sometimes people say blog, but they don't say blog. They'll say like journal or diary or watch my journal.

[00:10:01.590] - Liz T.
And I'm like, no, call a blog, a blog. Yeah. Let's let's just call things what they are. Guys, no need to be creative. It's more important to communicate. It's communication trumps clarity, I mean trumps creativity, even though creativity is great and I'm a creative human. But you always want to be clear,

[00:10:17.980] - Liz S.
There's a time place for it.

[00:10:19.510] - Liz T.
Yes, there is a time and place for it. And so, number three, when you're thinking about your brand message statement.

[00:10:25.510] - Liz T.
So this is the statement that's really important to have. You know, this is the thing that we don't want to be mis-communicating. I want you to make sure it's including the three things, these three things. This is tip number three. The three things are 1. Who you are as a business, 2.Who you help your demographic. And 3. The problem that you're solving. So like your brand message statement, sometimes it can be one sentence. Like I said, it could be a series of sentences that communicates this.

[00:10:54.400] - Liz T.
But when you have it down pat, I want you to like have it. So it's not embarrassing to say out loud. It's something that comes out super naturally and it's something that you could even tailor and pare down to be an Instagram bio. They end up working really, really well there. And so I want you guys to all like when you're looking at brand message statements, I mean, like let's say you do the exercise and your pasting, your website, and everybody's like, are you a tarot card reader?

[00:11:17.260] - Liz T.
And you're like, no.

[00:11:20.140] - Liz T.
Maybe it's like a huge thing that, like, got missed or you said something and, you know, and so I want it to be like painfully obvious. Another way to kind of arrive at your brand message statement, that's really easy without having to answer hard questions, is writing a letter to your best friend about your business. And so I like to have people do this. You can open up a new email in Gmail literally write to your best friend and be like, hey, best friend, besty, you know, my name is Liz Theresa.

[00:11:48.970] - Liz T.
Like, here's what I do with my business: I make websites and I help people use the right words in the right places because I think you know sales copy can be cheesy and I try to make it wicked fun and, you know, and and so people can sell their stuff and not feel like used car salesman. That's how I would probably tell my friend about my business. And so when you think about talking to a friend, you don't have heirs.

[00:12:11.470] - Liz T.
I think a lot of times and this is just because of social media. Everything is so filtered. We always, it's a mindset that you always think that you have to sound better than you are. And when we accept that we're actually enough and where we're good and we're all worth it. That's how everybody says earn your worth, charge, your worth. I'm like, you're worth more than what you charge because you're a human. Such a weird expression.

[00:12:34.840] - Liz T.
I understand it. But this is all to say. Own how you show up and accept that you're showing up as enough. And when and when you accept that, then you're like, OK, I make websites. I could say something like, I am a prestigious website designer who does this, only works with seven figure entrepreneurs, like I can say like all that stuff, but it's just stuff. OK, so they get really clear on just not having the heirs because something that people say about me that I really take this very seriously and it's something that I'm immensely grateful for, is that like people say, I come off very authentic.

[00:13:11.070] - Liz T.
And that's what I want. I couldn't ask for a better thing, I actually did this. This might be a cool action step for folks too, that are, is on Instagram, yesterday, I did a poll and I said, what words come to mind when you think about my brand? And the words were so interesting, right. You should do this. It's wicked fun.

[00:13:31.420] - Liz S.
I'm terrible at Instagram. I'm going to work on it before the summit. We'll see if it's any better by the time the Summit airs.

[00:13:38.160] - Liz T.
Oh, you can do it. I it's the brain. It's like part of anything. It's like anything. It requires practice. And it was, I was blown away. Well one I was excited people responded because sometimes when you do polls you're like, what if people I don't know, I always seem like what if people don't answer that? I'm like, well then I'll be the only one who knows and is disappointed. But what was so great is that they they all kind of said and this kind of surprised me, approachable was said three times, human, human and like all of these other ones, authentic.

[00:14:09.000] - Liz T.
There were words that came up too, fun. But approachable was the one that everybody said.

[00:14:14.460] - Liz T.
And I was like I was like, oh, well, that's that's great and accidental. But I almost wonder when you said you went to my website, you kind of hit on this where you were like you got inspired by my site. And I would I like to think it's because the way that I deliver copy is without heirs. It's in a way that sounds genuinely like me and I. And I feel like that is a useful tactic. Whether or not you are a personal brand, like, yeah, it's always, oh, man, this is getting to tip number four.

[00:14:43.380] - Liz T.
My goodness gracious. Because it's kind of seeping into tip number four. But it's that it's the it's the showing up as you are, in owning your voice. And in a practical sense, what this actually means is, you know, personal brands and non personal brands should use first person whenever possible. That's the truth. Always. Like even, and when you "we" you should only "we" in your copy, if you're actually a "we" so if you're a team and you're speaking contextually as your team, so like "we, your team believe..." Are committed to whatever, and that's when the "we"s are allowed.

[00:15:23.490] - Liz T.
But when you're a personal brand and then you're like, I'm Liz Theresa consulting, we make good websites, but it's really just me. It would be mega weird. Like if the "we"s, right? Aren't they like they're like the sweater vest copy of the Internet.

[00:15:38.400] - Liz T.
Like they're like, why are you we-ing? You got the patches on my elbow.

[00:15:45.510] - Liz T.
You're like, what are we doing here? And then like I've had the people that we they come to me and they hire me for copy. This has happened before. They'll be like, I've been we-ing because it sounds so professional. And I was like, but like does it? Does it sound real, well? Does it sound clear? And they're like, well, I'm trying to appear to a corporate market. And I'm like, well, the decision makers in corporate are still going to smell it because it's weird.

[00:16:11.430] - Liz T.
It's not like they're not human just because they're corporations. Corporations aren't robot people, are they?

[00:16:16.050] - Liz S.
Well, I've seen some Doctor Who episodes. I'm just kidding.

[00:16:21.780] - Liz T.
You're like, actually.... I'm just kidding.

[00:16:25.830] - Liz T.
We're Liz's.

[00:16:26.840] - Liz S.
And we often we often forget. I think a lot of people forget that companies are people. Right, because and that's true of everyone. Because I'm sure at some point you've gotten an email and I know I've got an email or, you know, like ranting at you and you're like, dude, calm down. Like, I was like, I'm just a person. If you don't like, that's fine. You can leave. But, you know, like people forget that there are people behind the websites.

[00:16:50.490] - Liz T.
Oh, man. And it's so much easier for folks to hide behind email when they say the horrible things.

[00:16:55.950] - Liz S.
Yeah, I feel like I think you've made it though, when you get your first hate email.

[00:17:00.840] - Liz T.
Oh, man, I have. You've also made it when I feel like people start to criticize you and they feel like they're like, will she notice. Yeah, that's when I'm like I made it, like I had a girl be like, oh, she messaged me on Instagram. And she was like, she's like, you look so much younger if you didn't wear eyeliner. And I was like, it's like I've worn I like honestly, you know, it's wild about this.

[00:17:20.730] - Liz T.
I weren't eyeliner since I was like eleven. I'm just so I was moody and so like I was so sassy.

[00:17:27.870] - Liz T.
But then I was like, oh, I just I like, I like that's part of how I look that my life.

[00:17:33.210] - Liz S.
I literally had some this was years ago. Yeah. Like intentionally joined my email list just so she could email me a 800 word like this is why you're wrong and I don't like you. And I was like, there's a contact form.

[00:17:48.940] - Liz T.
You were like it's really the whole time.

[00:17:51.150] - Liz S.
It's like, I was like you to a lot of effort. Like I'm really inspiring some passion. Sweet.

[00:17:57.180] - Liz T.
Yeah.It's almost like the first time you're completely copycatted right where somebody takes your copy, well when you write good copy. Right. That's happened. I had some girl, she copied my entire brand message statement.

[00:18:10.540] - Liz T.
And then she used it as hers, and I know you're supposed to be mad like everybody's mad when this happens, I genuinely was excited that I was noticed enough to be copied.

[00:18:21.610] - Liz T.
I was like,

[00:18:22.330] - Liz S.
It's okay to be so excited. But you should also still do something about it.

[00:18:25.330] - Liz T.
I well, I kind of waited for her to fizzle, and then she fizzled. It was like she was only online, like a few months, I think. And then like...

[00:18:33.700] - Liz S.
I mean, if you can't come up with your own copy and you're like pitching you're a copywriter is not really going to....

[00:18:38.720] - Liz T.
Oh, I it was not going to fly. Right. I know. I was like I was like, oh, that's so cute. I don't know. I'm the worst. You're right. I should have been way more mad. I should have been like, hey!

[00:18:47.950] - Liz S.
It's not that you need to be mad. I'm just saying you need to protect your brand.

[00:18:50.980] - Liz T.
You're so right now, that's good advice. That's why there's I don't know if you're having legal people coming.

[00:18:56.050] - Liz S.
We absolutely are, yes.

[00:18:57.410] - Liz T.
Yeah. I feel like I know so many people like, I don't know. Do you know Hashtag Legal? They're great.

[00:19:03.280] - Liz S.
Yes, Jamie spoke at the 2020 Summit.

[00:19:06.220] - Liz T.
Oh so yeah. So Jamie is, like because I just thought of Jamie when I was like eh, and I'm like Jamie would also be mad I just said that. Because I'm like Jamie would be like "protect your stuff!"

[00:19:16.900] - Liz T.
It is your content and it's your intellectual property. She is so smart.

[00:19:19.990] - Liz S.
And she did an amazing session last year.

[00:19:22.120] - Liz T.
People that work in that space. Very interesting. And this is also to say that copywriting too copywriting, I'm talking about the words, but like sometimes people think that copywriters like me know about copyright and like I only know like...

[00:19:34.510] - Liz S.
Different things.

[00:19:35.800] - Liz T.
Right, the surface of it. Exactly, and that I would only say and then the legal people know it better. Is that like when you write something you have inherent, a basic copyright by writing it and then after that you have to hire a person. That's the only thing I know about copyright... 

[00:19:50.290] - Liz S.
Let's leave that to the legal sessions.

[00:19:52.150] - Liz T.
We will leave it to the legals. Yes, yeah, yeah, yeah. So I'd like to get so number five, this is my tip number five. There are certain phrases that compel to sell. And so this is kind of what I'm calling number five, which is a great name of a freebie, compel to sell. I haven't done that yet, but it's so catchy. But one of the best phrases that you can start to inject into your existing copy is just the words "like you."

[00:20:15.760] - Liz T.
So this sounds very simple. But like like I said before, when you're thinking about the the reflexive tone of speech, right, where you're like, I'm in the first person that's going to do the first step of being more personal, even if you are not a personal brand, this is important. Right. And then when you make it reflexive and you say, you know, I help entrepreneurs like you, jazz hands, then in that person, the reader's mind, they're like me.

[00:20:46.300] - Liz T.
So like even if they're like the reader who's like, I'm very skeptical, I don't believe in anything. The second they say, like you, they mean, who, me? Instantly. Because when we as people read the word you, our brain goes me every single time. Just because we were I don't know, we speak the language. We know how words work together. So the second that you add "like you" to anything. I mean, I always keep "like you" in my brand message statement.

[00:21:09.880] - Liz T.
That's a really good place to "like you" if you're going to use it as a verb. Always, always in sales copy. Always you always want to do the "like you's" because the "like you-s" are also getting to the heart of the problem. Right. And I have kind of touched on the problem earlier. And so this may be tip six. I maybe have more than five.

[00:21:29.560] - Liz S.
That's OK.

[00:21:30.220] - Liz T.
I think, I think you'll forgive me, but like when you're touching on the, "like you-s" because you're then getting into the head of the reader, the way to make them stay and keep their attention is that they feel they're in a place that understands them.

[00:21:46.060] - Liz T.
For somebody to feel in a place of being understood, they need to have their problem repeated to their face. So that's why your brand message statement, it's really important to capture your problem that you solve.

[00:21:57.850] - Liz T.
OK, and that's why too on sales pages and in sales copy in general, you often see things like "can you imagine" or like "do you ever think..." or like have "you ever experienced...." or even like on commercials for horrible prescription medication? Because there's so many different types. Right. You'll see them walking with the partner like I can't keep up with my grandkids and then they're like rubbing their hip.

[00:22:23.710] - Liz T.
So it's like people need to see their problem being illustrated before their eyes in the way of copy and the "like you: will get your brain also going in that direction and it will also help the person reading be able to say, yes, you fit into my world because that right. The brand message statement is like the shorter way to do this. But then the longer way to do it is to to have to have time being spent on the pain.

[00:22:49.510] - Liz T.
So the pain of like, you know, I totally get that you don't want to write copy yourself and you'd rather like staple your laptop until it breaks or like throw it in front of traffic or, you know what I mean?

[00:23:01.000] - Liz T.
Like, you can be kind of creative, you know.

[00:23:04.690] - Liz S.
Yeah, chuck it out the window.

[00:23:05.420] - Liz T.
Set it, set it on fire. Yes. Yeah. Oh my God. I could go so, so many dark places with that, but like it's true, right? So as long as that's that's more compelling than "I'm Liz I write copy." And I think so often this kind of like this sort of like sneaks and seeps its way into the strategy that you use when you approach all aspects of your content marketing, not just your copy for your homepage, but like when you're showing up as your business on social media, are you talking enough about the problems or are you spending time being like, I have a lunch, everybody look at my lunch?

[00:23:41.410] - Liz T.
You know? Not to say that you shouldn't be salesy, you know, and not to say that because it's important that people know who you are and what you're actually selling, how you you know, what to buy and what to do with you, how to give you money.

[00:23:55.000] - Liz S.
This is a, that's a problem other people have, is that they never actually sell.

[00:23:59.020] - Liz T.
Yeah, but that is a, that's another like another day, another talk for another day. But yeah. Like having a mix of posts. You got to mix up your content too like you want to have engaging kind of content like I did a wicked good one. Oh my God. This would be fun for your group, maybe you could borrow it. But like if your business was a desert, what desert would you be and why?

[00:24:21.530] - Liz T.
Yeah, and I took me some time, but I was like I'd so be a banana split because all the hot fudge is the fun with like a lot of hot fudge fun. Yeah. That's just what I decided because big ostentatious, a little ridiculous, funny looking, bananas, you know, that's very me. So but like that's one type of content that I post. But then the other times it'll be like, girl, why don't you accept, why are you accepting less than you deserve in your life and your business?

[00:24:47.770] - Liz T.
What if you knew how to show up and use the right words? What if your brand reflected how you felt inside and you didn't feel like you were just yelling in the dark room to tell people to buy things? That's how people feel about copy. And it's the biggest shame in the world because I feel like they should just go, they should take what's theirs. They should look at it more simply. They shouldn't think of it as like...

[00:25:07.750] - Liz S.
Really like pretend you're telling your best friend. Like, I think that actually the greatest advice because the more you, because you're not talking down to, you don't talk down to your best friend. You're not trying to show that you're smart. You're just, you're honest and you're straight to the point. And that's really what people respond to.

[00:25:27.070] - Liz T.
Yeah. And also too I think sometimes people get, they do get let down. I think that there's still a lot of us that measure our success in likes and in sales and all these different things our business can do. But you get what you give is what I would advise people that are like, I'm waiting for these things to happen. I'm doing all the right things, I'm doing the right copy and all that. And I'm like, well are you engaging with your people that would normally buy from you?

[00:25:50.710] - Liz T.
How are you making your, show up and be a part of their world? People don't accidentally get married. Do you know what I mean, like, you've to ask somebody to marry you, so in the same line...

[00:26:01.360] - Liz T.
I'd be like, it's not so crazy to be a little bit like here I am, to people that should hire you. Yeah. Yeah. That's that's what I would say in my five or six, seven tips. I know I got a little excited.

[00:26:14.610] - Liz S.
That's OK. Those were awesome. Just to sort of recap, you want to make sure that there is no confusion on your homepage, that your message is super clear. And a great way to do that, a nice action step is to have an outside perspective.

[00:26:25.950] - Liz S.
So whether you do UserBob or you post it in the thread in the Facebook group, there will be a designated thread. So don't just go dropping links, but a designated thread where people can kind of help you out. The second one was keep your menu simple and clean and no more than five so that you're not forcing decision fatigue on people, which is a real thing. It's a psychological thing. Make sure you,r make sure I'm checking my notes.

[00:26:51.490] - Liz S.
You know,

[00:26:51.970] - Liz T.
You're so good.

[00:26:53.940] - Liz S.
So tip number three was your your statement should cover who you are, who you help and the problem your solving.

[00:27:00.060] - Liz T.
Yes.

[00:27:00.730] - Liz S.
OK, and then get rid of the the the "we"s everywhere.

[00:27:06.830] - Liz T.
The fake "we"s

[00:27:08.130] - Liz S.
No one wants to link you're like peeing on your copy. But sorry, that was really bad pun. So get rid of the "we"s and then you know. Oh, what was the last one?

[00:27:21.080] - Liz T.
Oh! The "like you"

[00:27:23.210] - Liz S.
The like you, make it make, show people that you can relate, you know, like you, I constantly didn't have enough time to blog. like you....

[00:27:31.620] - Liz T.
Yes.

[00:27:33.310] - Liz S.
The kids are home from school and I'm screwed.

[00:27:37.450] - Liz S.
Whatever the case may be, you know, whatever that struggle is like, be honest and open with it.

[00:27:42.640] - Liz S.
I think I kind of hit on all your tips, right?

[00:27:45.120] - Liz T.
Yeah, you did so great.

[00:27:46.330] - Liz T.
And then the pre tip tip was using simple words, ditching the "ologies" "isms" and "ations" as much as possible.

[00:27:52.660] - Liz S.
Yes. So I think that gives people a lot of things to do. I definitely should probably be reviewing my homepage, but then go review their homepage. They can go get that outside perspective. They can clean up that copy, change you to, or "we" to I and throw in some "like you-s" and. Yeah, awesome. Any any final words. Where can people learn more about you get awesome stuff from you?

[00:28:14.740] - Liz T.
