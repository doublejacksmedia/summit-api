[00:00:00.260] - Liz Stapleton, Host
All right, guys, thank you so much for joining us. We've got Kelsey Silver here with a decade of experience as a licensed therapist, corporate consultant, and MIT-trained analyst, Kelsey is on a mission to support neurodivergent entrepreneurs in scaling their business even on low spoon days with strategies that work with their brain, not against it, through her company, The Neurospicy CEO. I love that name. Kelsey shares simple strategies to help neurodivergent entrepreneurs achieve success by embracing a business strategy that honors their neurodivergence and bankrolls their life. Kelsey, welcome. Thank you so much for coming.

[00:00:45.660] - Kelsey Silver
Thank you so much for having me. I'm so excited for this conversation.

[00:00:48.280] - Liz
I am, because we're going to be talking about creating a simple, sustainable foundation for your business, which I love. And I was digging through Instagram and stuff, and I was like, "I needed this like six years ago." I was like, "It's me."

[00:01:06.230] - Kelsey
Oh, I've heard that. I'm like, "That's my brain."

[00:01:13.010] - Liz
First, why don't you go ahead and define what you mean by neurospicy, and how it exhibits itself? Let's start there.

[00:01:20.810] - Kelsey
Yeah, absolutely. So neurodivergent is a term that was actually coined back in the '80s, and it literally means anything that any brain patterns that diverge from the norm. So it covers a really wide umbrella that we don't tend to think about. So you think neurodivergent? "Oh, that's ADHD and autism." It's also bipolar, PTSD, childhood trauma, schizophrenia. It actually covers this really wide breadth of people that think differently than what's considered the norm. And so it's always really rewarding when people are like, "But I don't have ADHD, but that's my brain." And when I hear that, because it's true, it's simply that your brain thinks differently than what society has always told you you were supposed to think. You process sensory input differently. You solve problems differently. And what's really cool is that neurodivergent individuals are three times more likely to become entrepreneurs. So we're seriously overrepresented in a really great way within the entrepreneur community, but a lot of the stuff out there is by neurotypical people that don't really have strategies that work with the way our brains work. So that's where I come in.

[00:02:38.230] - Liz
Yes. But let's talk about how if maybe you didn't realize you were neurodivergent, there's a lot of things out there. Some ways it may come out in business that might surprise people and be able to recognize, "Oh, hey, yeah, that's right."

[00:02:55.960] - Kelsey
The most common is, do you consider yourself multi-passionate? That's like top one, right? A lot of the clients I've worked with that identified themselves as multi-passionate did, in fact, find a root in their neurodivergence. A lot of other ways that it might present itself are in shiny object syndrome, meaning that you really like to dive into different tools or have a bunch of different methods. So not necessarily multi-passionate in the sense of many different types of businesses, but you skip around a lot in your business. And a lot of times the really tangible way it manifests in business is, I grew up in Louisiana. So you know those houses that are built on stilt? When your business looks like that. You've got this really beautiful, beautiful second and third floor. But that first floor, that foundation of your business is on stilts and it's like... That business structure is usually the result of someone who's neurodivergent not really being able to set up that foundation that's supportive of this really beautiful house.

[00:04:13.720] - Liz
Yes. But just because you may have started that way doesn't mean you can't go back and fix it, which I have done a lot in my business. I was like, Oh, I'd be so much further if I didn't have to keep going back and fixing things. But it really helps long term that I do. So let's talk about what that foundation should look like and how to approach it when you're neurodivergent.

[00:04:39.790] - Kelsey
Yeah, absolutely. So the first word, I mean, it's like in everything I do is simple. And that goes for neurotypical people, too. This is not solely for neurodivergent people. When you have something that is simple and standardized as your basis, as your foundation, you can keep returning back to it because you know what that structure is. And for neurodivergent people, simple also needs to be flexible. We talked a little bit about those low spoon days, right? That's in my intro. And it's because for neurodivergent people, if you know Spoon Theory or not, our energy levels fluctuate, a lot, and so does everyone's. But honoring, having a foundation in your business that honors when that energy fluctuates is essential. Because if you're forcing yourself to fit into this tiny little box of a structure that's "Well, but it's standard. I must comply", it's going to fail.

[00:05:47.280] - Liz
I think one of the hardest lessons, it took me a few years to learn, is that sometimes, especially as an entrepreneur because it comes to you, rest is the most productive thing you can do, because it'll take you five times longer if you try to push through it. Whereas if you just go lay down for 30 minutes, rest is the most productive thing you can do sometimes. Sometimes you have to. Sometimes you're on deadline. It happens, but generally speaking, rest can be productive. I think a lot of people forget that, especially, I mean, just the way our society is built, not to get all into that. But yeah. Can you maybe talk about a real world example of something foundational that would be simple yet flexible?

[00:06:31.170] - Kelsey
Yeah. What are you tracking? Okay? So having a way to track the important numbers in your business, but in a way that isn't constantly looking at your numbers, constantly festering over them, constantly wondering what you want to do, is a really great foundation. So there's four numbers that I always suggest we look at, and that is how many leads you have, what are your products, what's your conversion rate, and what's your revenue. Now, there's plenty more. I'm a data analyst at heart, so there's a thousand things that I could look at. But having those four things lets you see what the health, it has your health check of your business, right? And you can, by tracking those numbers, you can do it at whatever cadence works for you. If you're having a really low day, you're at a low energy place, you're at a low mental health place, don't look at your numbers. Just don't. Look at them next week because these numbers aren't things that you necessarily need to look at every morning. But if you are that kind of person every morning you can sit down at your desk and look at those numbers. But so you're setting up a foundation that can be done at a cadence that works with your energy level, with your mental health, with where you're at in your place. So you're honoring yourself while still making sure that you're looking at things in a way that's going to drive your revenue forward, that's going to make sure that your business is sustainable.

[00:08:06.520] - Liz
Yes, and for just blogging context, because I feel like when you use leads, it's more seen in the context of if you're offering services, we're going to say email list, like growth, like your audience growth. And I would say email list over followers on social media because you don't own a social media platform. You don't own your Instagram, they could shut you down tomorrow. But your email list is an asset in your business you own. I'm going to interject that.

[00:08:32.040] - Kelsey
And to hone in on that a little bit more because that's a really important point, leads might be two or three different numbers. So it might be page views in addition to email, or page views might be your leads, and you look at the email in under your conversion rate. That's fine, too. It's really, that's the flexibility of the model is as long as you know and you've defined what those four numbers are for you and what's meaningful for your business and your brain, that's where the flexibility piece comes in.

[00:09:07.000] - Liz
Yes. Make sure you're having some data dates is what I like to call them. OK, so you mentioned tech being a focus for business owners, right? Because there's always the, "Oh, this is the magic tech wand that's going to fix all my problems and make me super rich and sell all my things." And there's always new tech. So it's a hard thing to learn to pull back from. I may or may not have had to recover from an AppSumo addiction.

[00:09:42.790] - Kelsey
I was just going to ask if you were a recovering AppSumo addict. I knew it. I had you pegged.

[00:09:48.590] - Liz
You did, you did. Now if there's something that I'm like, okay, but this could apply, I actually bounce it off my sister who worked as my VA for a little while, she doesn't anymore, but she knows enough about my business, where I'm like, "Am I allowed to buy this?" Because I need that outside perspective, because otherwise I will just... So let's chat about the tech and the ways it can support you, but also in the ways it can detract from what you're doing.

[00:10:17.280] - Kelsey
Yeah. So I have a model within my business. I use it with my private clients and also my group program. I call it The Fellowship Mess that I'm a huge Lord of the Rings nerd. My daughter is named after an individual in Lord of the Rings. It's just my life. It is what it is. I call it The Fellowship Model, and it's tech, team, and talent. And so tech plays a huge role in the structure of your business. But there's some really important parameters around that technology, as you've mentioned. First and foremost, we're talking about flexibility. I tell all my clients, you've got to work in a neurospicy tax. There is a portion of your budget that is for things that costed money because you are spicy. That's just having a part of your budget, first of all, that you acknowledge is going to be, "I bought a thing on AppSumo that I probably shouldn't have bought." And so it gives you grace to play without feeling guilt and detriment and all that. It's a small portion, but it's there. And so there's this little neurospicy tax that I always say. On top of that, though, I really encourage people to look at what is the resource investment? Not the money investment. That's a whole other conversation. What is your resource investment in playing with this new technology? ChatGPT, free version. Resource investment, mostly it's going to be time playing with it. What are you willing to invest in playing with it? Are you willing to invest money in these people that have all of these prompt workbooks? Maybe, maybe not. If you're not willing to invest in those, are you going to invest? So it's all about resource management and allowing yourself to be flexible with what that is. The same goes for, for example, I use a technology called Use Motion, and it's a productivity tool. It lets me schedule everything. It's my God send. But it was a higher monetary investment. The resources were monetary. Took very little time to set up, but I got resources back because the AI tells me what's my highest priority next to-do task and plugs it into the space in my calendar that's available. I was able to balance the monetary resource requirement and the time to set it up with how much resources I'd get back. And so it's really, for me, my brain works really well in numbers. That's where my data analyst comes in. I literally have a chart that's like, what's it going to cost in terms of a scale of one to 10? What am I going to get back scale of one to 10? What am I going to invest in it one to 10? And I score it out. I'm like, "You know what? That actually it either evens out or I'm going to get stuff back from it. Cool. I'm going to go for it." So it's the pattern of analyzing when I go to purchase this thing or when I go to play with this thing, because free tools are always the worst. What am I investing and what am I going to get back in return?

[00:13:29.810] - Liz
Yes, I like that. Okay, so as far as making sure you've got a strong foundation, we've talked about simplicity, flexibility, and particular numbers to track, tech. What are some other elements of having a simple yet strong foundation for your business?

[00:13:47.280] - Kelsey
Yeah, it's the actual strategy.

[00:13:50.890] - Liz
Okay.

[00:13:52.310] - Kelsey
The foundation for your business, so you've got what to track is that the what you can track can only make sense if you know what your goal is. Having a simplified strategy is going to give you the room and flexibility to build on it. If you're just starting in business, you said when we first started talking, you said, "Oh, my gosh, this is me like six years ago." If you're just starting in business, picking one-to-one, what is your one strategy for getting people onto your email list, if we use that example? Is it always making sure that there is a form at the bottom of each article? Is it embedding links in your article? If you try to do all the things, you're going to forget one. Your audience is going to expect one thing and get the other that time. So what is the one thing? Now you can do other things. There's the flexibility in, "Oh, I want to do this this time." As long as you still always do the first one. So what is your initial legion? Once you have people on your email list, the thing you own, what is your next point of contact with them? What is the next right step that they can take? And I really like that phrase. I repeat it a lot is, "What's the next right step?" I think it's from frozen, if I'm being honest.

[00:15:26.710] - Liz
The next right thing. I was totally just thinking that, so I guess.

[00:15:29.820] - Kelsey
I have a two year old, so I'm allowed.

[00:15:32.060] - Liz
Yeah, my niece and nephew, we listen to a lot of Frozen. Yeah, not as much these days, but yeah.

[00:15:38.900] - Kelsey
So yeah. So what's the next right thing? What's the next right step? And so if you plan out from the moment someone meets you to the moment they become a paying customer, because we're in this for monetary (either  through ad clicks or through actual paying for services) we're in this to create a sustainable business monetarily. If you plan out those touch points, but picking one for each touch point, then you can start to expand upon it. And that's what I mean by, okay, so we have our foundation. We have all of our little stilts. Now we're putting up the walls. We're boxing ourselves in while still having windows open, still having doors open. We can still let the air breathe. We can still let things come through. We can still allow our creativity, but we have the safety of some walls and parameters where if we are at a low energy day or we're not quite sure what the next right thing is, we know what it should be. It doesn't have to be, but we know what it can be, what it should be. And so it's about creating those structures and those scaffoldings in place so that when we don't have... When we're just not in the decision making process, when you're sitting in front of the stove and you're like, "What the heck am I going to cook today?" You have your list of recipes that are go-to. Same applies to your business. You have your one or two things that you know you can always go to when you just don't know what the next thing is.

[00:17:13.120] - Liz
Okay, I like that. I did want to hone in a little bit more because you're talking about having a clear strategy. But one thing I know I've struggled with in the past is, yeah, I'll have a clear strategy, and then I don't know where I put it, or I don't reference it, or I don't... You know, do you have any suggestions in terms of where to house that strategy and make sure it's what you're going? It's your playbook that you're going back to?

[00:17:42.050] - Kelsey
Yeah. So I'm a big SOP nerd, like a standard operating procedure nerd.  So I have templates out the wazoo for my SOPs. And it's how do I make a decision about adding a new legion? But that doesn't work for everybody. So making the decision as to where your hub is, that's where your decision matrix is. And so for some people, that's Notion. For some people, that's ClickUp. I do not recommend an analog notebook, but some people need it. But knowing that every time you go to make a decision that is central to your business, so large purchase, new hire, new product, those sorts of decisions that are going to have a true impact on your actual business trajectory, you go back to that single document where you've outlined this strategy. And I tend to do it by actual timeline. What I recommend with my clients is map it out. Neurodivergent individuals typically can be very visual or on the other extreme, very… They need a flow chart diagram, that's me. That's the spicy that I fit into. Or they can't have that level of sensory input and they need something that is much more bulleted. Pick the one that works for you, have it in a single place and revisit it at minimum quarterly and then definitely monthly. And so by revisiting it, you're creating these kinesthetic triggers in your brain of, "This is the right place. This is what will show me that next right step. This is that guiding star." I even say connect those things that we measure to that strategy. And when you're doing your data dates, as you phrase them, reference it in accordance with that strategy. And so you're building this pathway in your brain of, "When I do this, I look here. When I do this, I look in that same spot. When I make this decision, I look in that same spot." And it's about training your brain to keep going back to that one place. And if you are really drawn to move it somewhere else, everything has to shift to that one place. You have to acknowledge that you're going to have to rebuild those kinesthetic triggers.

[00:20:15.040] - Liz
And again, that's looking at what's the investment in your time. It's not investment. Oh, it doesn't always mean money. I mean, time is money. Time you can't get back. You can earn more money.

[00:20:24.980] - Kelsey
Exactly. And I always... So I had a client who was like, I'm going to move my entire Notion to ClickUp. "Uh-huh. How long?"

[00:20:34.020] - Liz
I mean I love ClickUp, but yeah.

[00:20:35.420] - Kelsey
"How long is that going to take you?" "Okay." We had the conversation now for her, ClickUp, it had the resources she needed. Her team was going to be able to use it a lot better than Notion. That panned out.

[00:20:47.840] - Liz
It was worth it.

[00:20:48.430] - Kelsey
We, in fact, did move over to ClickUp. As you say, you love ClickUp. There are huge advantages. But it was a whole decision making process to get to that place. And her whole strategy shifted around ClickUp.

[00:21:02.030] - Liz
Yeah. I will say like... I want two comments I have there. One is that when I decided I was going to double down on ClickUp and really get into it, and I have some things I need to fix in it. With the way I have it set up, I realize it's not working. It's creating bottlenecks. I need to fix some things. But I signed up for a membership that taught me how to do it so that I could figure... I wasn't just being my head against the wall so that I had some expertise leading me. So take the time to learn the thing you're committing to. It makes a big difference. And the other thing I wanted to say was that whatever you choose, there's no one right tool. You just got to figure out what works for you and recognize that it might be a combination of tools sometimes. It just really varies in what you're going to do day to day. What can you commit to day to day? So ClickUp, I know I need to fix things in it, but I go in each day and I look at my home, which has my list of tasks do that day. So that is useful to me. It gives me a place to go back to, like you said, and some place to start.

[00:22:20.340] - Kelsey
Well, and it can be different. Your day to day can reside in a place that's different than your strategy. That sometimes people need to... I know for myself, my strategy resides in Miro, which is this very visual graphic user interface place that's like, I can really see this beautiful plan because it's inspirational to me, so I like to look at it, it's pretty, and it works with the way that I need to visualize it. I couldn't produce something like that in Notion or in ClickUp in a way that triggers my brain to be interested in it. But I have built the pathway in my brain to know that that is still where I go. So even though it resides in a different place, and in my day to day I use AirTable a lot. In my day to day, I live in AirTable and in Use Motion. Those are the two places I live. I still know I'm always going to go back to Miro to look at my strategy. So it's okay to be several tools. As long as first you've done the work to learn the tool and make sure that you're actually maximizing it. And second, you have to have a one to one ratio for the type of task to the product. So every task can only have one place to do the work. So it's okay if each kind of task has a different place, as long as you're always doing that same kind of thing in the same place, because otherwise it's going to end up... I always use the analogy of the Hoarders House of Google Drive.

[00:24:02.690] - Liz
I feel a little attacked by that. I'm not going to lie.

[00:24:05.470] - Kelsey
I'm sorry. I honor you. I empathize.

[00:24:08.490] - Liz
It's okay. I'm working on it. I'm building out my SOPs. I'm getting better at my naming conventions. It's a process.

[00:24:15.600] - Kelsey
But it is. It's a huge process.

[00:24:18.480] - Liz
Yeah. Especially, I've been in business for almost 10 years, so I've got a lot of back stuff and some stuff I'm just not going to get to. And that's okay. It's moving forward, getting it right.

[00:24:30.710] - Kelsey
And that's where it's fun to just make an archive folder and shove everything in.

[00:24:34.680] - Liz
I just call it old, and I'm like...

[00:24:37.180] - Kelsey
I put a Z in front of it, Zold. Because then it goes to the very bottom, I don't look at it.

[00:24:43.030] - Liz
There you go, yeah, yeah. But it's fun. Sometimes you dig in there and you're like, Oh, that was actually pretty good.

[00:24:48.930] - Kelsey
We're going to resurrect that. Yeah, exactly.

[00:24:51.440] - Liz
And then the other thing I would say in terms of... We talked about the resource and the cost of implementing something, but you can systemize and automate a lot of things, like a lot of things. You throw Zapier in there, you throw in automations for whatever tool you use. I use ClickUp, you use Airtable. It's insane, but same thing still applies. So I'm like if... Because building out those automations can be so tedious.

[00:25:17.150] - Kelsey
I say I use the rule of five.

[00:25:20.660] - Liz
Okay.

[00:25:21.350] - Kelsey
So if I have to do it more than five times in a certain time frame, so typically for me, it's within five times within a week or five times within a month, I need to automate it. That's typically how I phrase it, how I think about it. But you're right. You still absolutely have to balance it with, okay, if it's a really complex automation, that's going to be a bunch of different steps. Maybe that's if I'm doing it five times in a day.

[00:25:49.420] - Liz
Yeah.

[00:25:50.440] - Kelsey
If I'm doing it five times in a day, then yeah, it's probably worth that large investment. But if I'm doing it five times in a month, no.

[00:25:56.120] - Liz
Yeah. Well, so I look at it like, okay, if I spend a day figuring this automation out, am I going to get that at least that time back and then some? Which is where I... Because the summit, I'm like, Well, I'm only running the summit once a year. I really have six months where it's a focus, and four if those months, it's a real priority. And so building out some of the summit automations, I'm like, "Oh, my God, this is taking forever". But I'm like, but I'm going to have to do this thing for each session. And there's like 50 sessions. So as tedious as it is, it's so nice once it's working. So just considering that return on the automations and making sure that taking the time to set it up is worth it, because if it's a complex thing, if it's simple, yeah, save yourself the 20 seconds.

[00:26:49.530] - Kelsey
And what technology you need to do the setup. If it can be done in your CRM, that's probably something you're more familiar with. So low investment there. If you're going to need to use that Zapier, and you've never used that before, okay.

[00:27:04.250] - Liz
Yeah. No, I like that. Okay, let me just look at my notes, see if I had any other questions I wanted to make sure that we covered. Actually, real quick, let's touch on how to get started with SOPs if you don't have any. Because a lot of people, especially when you're a solopreneur, it's like, "Well, what do I need an SOP for?" So how to get started and make a habit of building those out, if you have any tips?

[00:27:32.030] - Kelsey
Yeah, absolutely. So my business is called the Neurospicy CEO, right? CEO is a really weird term for a lot of entrepreneurs. We don't think of ourselves like CEOs, except we own a business. It's ours. Thus we are a CEO. And so even a solopreneur who has no team, who is just starting out, if you have a business name, my dear, you are a CEO. And what that means is that eventually you might have a team. Eventually, you might have a business that brings in a nice chunk of revenue, because otherwise you probably wouldn't be doing a business. And so in order to make those things happen, you have to do certain things in a certain way. Now, your strategy can be all over the place. We've talked about all the different foundational pieces, but there are certain things you have to do. You probably, especially since we've talked about email list, need to send emails. That might be helpful. So... Not that much. You may need to repeat a process frequently called blog posting. That might be a thing that you do. And so for each of these things that you do in any sort of repeatable cadence, the first or second, usually the third time you do the thing, record yourself doing it. Now you can use a service called Scribe, it's free. It's nifty. It's okay. It's AI, so it's like meh.

[00:29:10.250] - Liz
Tango is another one that's good. I'm just throwing that out there.

[00:29:13.170] - Liz
Yeah.

[00:29:13.710] - Kelsey
So there's tools that will literally record what you do, both of them are equal, you know, record what you do and create a basic document for you with screenshots. And then there's two ways to use that that are really effective. The next time you go to do the thing, try to follow it and see if it actually makes sense. Or third, I meant second, but whatever. Second, when you bring on a VA, hand them that SOP and say, try to do it just like this the first time you do it. And then if it doesn't work, you edit it, you alter it because the terminology you used may not jive with the person.

[00:30:01.710] - Liz
Tools change and-

[00:30:02.760] - Kelsey
Yeah, yeah. But using it in those two ways. But it gives you the flexibility as a solopreneur who has no team, who barely thinks of themselves as a CEO, but is doing the thing over and over again. It gives you confidence that you're not missing anything. It gives you the freedom to do things even when your energy is low because you don't have to think about what the next right move is. And it ensures that your audience, in whatever fashion, is receiving things in a way that's consistent, even if you yourself are inconsistent.

[00:30:39.040] - Liz
Yes. No, I like that. That's amazing.

[00:30:41.770] - Kelsey
And I actually, truthfully, I have three different types of SOP. So for every SOP, I write, I write three versions.

[00:30:47.590] - Liz
Okay, tell me more.

I write a three spoon version, which is like the beautiful, very like corporate, spoony version. Sorry, that's my one-spoon version. That's my "I have no idea what I'm even thinking right now. I can barely function. I need every single step outlined for me, and I am going to do this like I'm a robot." That's my one-spoon version, and it's that very, very fleshed out version. I have a two-spoon version, which is like the template. It's got my general overarching ideas. It has reminders and good things. And then there's my three-spoon version. I've got all the energy. I want to do the thing, but I want to have the flexibility to play. And that's more of just an outline. It's got little reminders, things like that. And I flip them on their head. So in my Google Doc, it's a single Google document, but it's got each version with the basic outline, then the more detailed template, and then the bottom section is my really fleshed out SOP. And so whatever I'm feeling in the day, remember, I'm all about flexibility, right? Whatever I'm feeling in the day, I can go to the version that's going to support where I am, give me the wiggle room if I need it, or give me the full, comfortable, wrapped-up blanket structure if I'm in that place.

[00:32:06.700] - Liz
I like that. No, that's great. I hadn't actually thought about different types of SOPs, or different versions, I guess, of SOPs.

[00:32:15.330] - Kelsey
It's all in the same document, but it gives me that flexibility.

[00:32:18.640] - Liz
No, I like that. Fantastic. Okay, so we are running out of time, unfortunately. I have gotten a lot of ideas and just things percolating in my brain on how I want to adjust things in my business and hopefully everyone watching has as well. But I know you have some stuff to share, so why don't you tell us about that?

[00:32:38.470] - Kelsey
Yeah, absolutely. So I figured that I would make sure that we talked about a lot of different things today that I have a companion workbook called Simplify to Strategize. Words are hard. Simplify to Strategize is going to be a companion workbook that talks about setting up some of that scaffolding, how we talked about what to measure and how to have a single strategy. That's a workbook. You can work through it. It's quite literally just filling in the blank so that you can come up with something that looks like a flow chart. That's what I've got for you.

[00:33:10.590] - Liz
All right, well, that companion workbook sounds fantastic. I think you have something for the Speaker Bonus Bundle as well for people that have upgraded to get that.

[00:33:18.790] - Kelsey
Yes, I do. So there's a masterclass that I'm going to give away within the Speaker bonus bundle called Fail-fast, Fail-often. And it does go into a little bit of the neurodivergent psyche. So if you're neurodivergent curious, think you might be, or know you are, it does go into a little bit of that. But really the bulk of the class that's applicable across all the different neurotypes is about how we look at failure and how we can utilize failure in our business to constantly improve, because you know what? We're all going to fall on our face. We're all going to fall on our tush. It's about how we use those experiences to create better business structures.

You will learn so much faster from taking action and it not working out than from research, research, research. Like done is better than perfect. Take a shot, see how it goes.

[00:34:08.960] - Kelsey
Analysis paralysis is a detriment to your business. So take a shot, fail.

[00:34:14.290] - Liz
Definitely. So yeah, if that sounds good to you guys, make sure you get yourself the Speaker Bonus Bundle or join the annual plan for the Blogger Breakthrough Summit membership, so you get access to all the sessions plus the Speaker Bonus Bundle. It's a great deal. So again, Kelsey, thank you so much for joining us. I learned a lot, and I know, I'm sure everyone did too.

[00:34:33.650] - Kelsey
This was an absolute blast. I loved it. Thank you so much for having me.
