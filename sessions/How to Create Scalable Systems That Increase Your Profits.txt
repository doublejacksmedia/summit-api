All.

[00:00:00.250] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Right, guys. I'm excited to share this next session with you from Stephanie. Welcome, Stephanie.

[00:00:07.340] - Steph Blake
Hi. Thanks for having me. I'm excited.

[00:00:09.620] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Yes, because you are going to be talking about creating scalable systems and increasing your profits because systems are so essential to scaling, period. You can't keep doing one-off stuff. You're not going to get very far fast. So can you give us a highlight of what you're going to cover in the session?

[00:00:27.870] - Steph Blake
Yeah. So there's three big things that you're going to learn throughout it. And the first is the importance of using a digital project management tool in your business and getting out of your pretty printed planner.

[00:00:39.970] - Steph Blake
So.

[00:00:40.540] - Steph Blake
We're taking it online, we're getting digital.

[00:00:42.460] - Speaker 1
The.

[00:00:43.120] - Steph Blake
Second thing is to know what to work on each and every day because that's something that a lot of entrepreneurs struggle with. They don't know what to do. They're just all over the place. And then the third is why automations are crucial for creating a scalable business. So we are diving into all of those and I cannot wait for you guys to watch it.

[00:01:04.470] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Yes. Let's go ahead and get started.

[00:01:07.100] - Steph Blake
So before we dive into all of that, I want to introduce myself. My name is Stephanie, Blake, and I help entrepreneurs scale to $5K plus months by creating scalable systems in their business. Now I love free classes like this. I mean, who doesn't love to get a ton of great information for free? But where I really like to hang out and chat with you one on one is on Instagram. That is my jam. So if you could right now, go ahead and snap a photo of this slide as you're watching it and tag me on Instagram stories. My handle is @theblakecollective. So once you do that, I will pop into your DMs and say, hey, and answer any questions that you have about this training and just chat with you and get to know you a little bit better. So let me ask you a question first. Do these photos look familiar to you? Countless papers and Post-it's covering your desk because you don't have a system to keep them organized? Or maybe you have a printed planner that you keep everything in. But I'm sorry to break it to you. That pretty printed planner just isn't cutting it to help you reach those big goals for your business.

[00:02:23.430] - Steph Blake
A physical planner can be supplementary. Don't get me wrong. But it cannot be the main way that you organize and automate the projects in your business. And this comes from somebody who had every single planner under the sun. Sure, they were filled with lots of pretty colored pens and stickers, but none of these planners set me up for success like a digital tool could. In order to run a successful business, you need to be planning for long term success, not on a day to day basis. And you cannot reach your goals, your long term goals, your freedom goals that you're working so hard for by only planning one week at a time or even one month at a time. You need to be planning on a long term basis. I'm talking quarters, even a year at a time. And then planning out those projects and then working backwards from them in order to reach your goals. But with that said, not all project management tools are created equal. And I'm sure that many of you have actually been wasting your time instead of saving it by signing up for a bunch of different tools. What is my favorite tool?

[00:03:37.550] - Steph Blake
And it is ClickUp. It is, I'm telling you from experience, the only project management tool that I use and recommend because it not only allows you to keep track of your projects and tasks, it also holds you accountable to completing them. And the whole point of using a tool, any tools to make sure that you complete the tasks within it. So we will be talking a little bit more about this, but I like to think of it as if I'm sure you've heard of Trello or Asana, those are some other popular ones. So if Trello and Asana had a baby, this would be it. Plus, it's free. So why wouldn't you do it? You want to make sure that even I know a lot of you are in the beginning stages of your business. So you want to make sure that you're setting yourself up for success, right? Because once you start to grow and you get busier and you have more clients, you won't want to worry about doing simple things like transferring over your project management tool. So I highly recommend starting out with this free tool, getting all of your information into it.

[00:04:43.540] - Steph Blake
And as you grow and scale, you can use more capabilities of it. Now, speaking of that, it is not just enough to focus on or to have a product management role. You also need to know what to focus on that is generating the most revenue. So you need to focus on IPAs or income producing activities in your business. And these are tasks that actually generate revenue for your business, not the things that you think do or the things that are quote-unquote, safe, like redesigning your website for the fifth time, or creating your logo again. Those things aren't actually making you money. So that is why I created something called Organize in Five. And it is a five-part framework to organizing your business and setting it up for success so you can scale it. So this system teaches you the importance of brain dumping. So you can clear the clutter from your head. How to focus on the income producing activities in your business, also known as those IPAs, setting up processes and templates so you're not recreating the wheel every single time you work on a project. And utilizing ClickUp in a way that ensures you get those IPAs completed.

[00:06:02.660] - Steph Blake
So part one is dump it. And this is where you're going to get everything out of your head and onto a sheet of paper or into a Google Doc. After that, you are going to color it. You're going to highlight all of the revenue generating activities in your business. Next, you are going to outline it. And by that, I mean, once those IPAs or those money makers are covered, you are going to list out all of the tasks that go into those. And there shouldn't be too many. There should only be between five and 10 of those. No more than that. After that, you are going to load it. So if you have all of your tasks outlined, you are going to put them into your project management tool, aka ClickUp.

[00:06:49.310] - Steph Blake
I really recommend it. And it's extremely easy to set up and you can start using it right away. So as I said before, this is by far the best project management platform that I've used because of the flexibility that it allows for any business. So let's just start with a quick tour of the platform. So in terms of the hierarchy of ClickUp, you have spaces, which I am in a space right now. And then you have folders. You can see the space right here. It's called Blog. And then you have the folders within there, and they have dropdowns. And then you have lists, which are these items right here. And then within those, you have tasks. So if you click to open, you can see there's more information there. So it goes to space, and then folder, list, and Tasks. Like I said, there's unlimited ways to set this up. But I'm just going to give you a very simplistic overview to start with, and then you can dive into it and do really whatever you want to customize it for your business. So the biggest difference between folders right here and lists are that the folders contain the items within them.

[00:08:10.190] - Steph Blake
So these list items are in the folder. Think of it similar to a file folder with papers inside of it. But these papers are more robust than just a simple piece of paper. So you have your folder, and then you have your, quote-unquote, pieces of paper within them. And from there, you have the task within. So once you click on a task, you can see that it opens it up and it presents even more ways to use it. So up at the top, you have the name of the item or the task. You have the status of where it falls on your list. And then you can also put descriptions in here. This is a description. You can put whatever information you want in there. You can also add subtasks, which are great. I'll show you. So once you add one in, it gives you other options to do. So you can see as I'm continuing to dive into the different parts, there's so many different ways to use this. But my favorite way to personally use subtasks is to set dates to them. So you can click, Set a date, and you can see that it gives you a lot of different options.

[00:09:26.660] - Steph Blake
So you can choose a predetermined date. You can choose later tomorrow, this weekend. So many different ways to use it. You can also set recurring tasks in here. That is that. You can also add little checklist, too. So we'll just call that a checklist. Or if you want to pull from the templates that you saved, you would just click that. I'll just say item one, item two. And then you can also assign these items in the checklist to other people on your team. You can also add attachments. If you want to add an attachment from any of these different areas, you can. Or if you wanted to comment, you can do that as well. So if you have team members that you wanted to share general information with, or say, for example, you have this blog post and you tag their name and you say, Tiffany, can you review? So that way, you don't have to be going back and forth over email. You can just have everything in one easy place to access for everybody, not just you, but everybody on your team as well. The next thing I wanted to quickly talk about was statuses.

[00:10:39.190] - Steph Blake
So you can see that I created a couple of example statuses here, but you can change those in the space setting or in the individual folder setting. So I'm going to show you how to do that in this space. So if you click these little ellipses right here, you go to space settings, and this gives you all of the the details for your space. So you can change the name, you can give access to different people. And then down here under task statuses is where you can change the status. So I just added a few examples... I have a couple ones here, just different aspects of creating blog posts. And you could just hit review changes and then it'll pop up with this box again. So as you can see, I know I keep saying this, but there's really so many different ways that you can use this for your business. You can add additional spaces here for, for example, we'll call this your biz HQ. So maybe this is where you have your media kit, any financial information, whatever it is, whatever you want to put a little piece of pizza there for that icon.

[00:11:52.440] - Steph Blake
We'll just do that. If you want to add custom statuses, you can do that when you create the space or afterward, like I just showed you. And then you also have different click apps that you can enable. So you can enable the ability to have multiple assignees on projects. You can add time tracking, time tracking rollup priority. There's so many different options that you can have, including custom fields, too. So if you don't see something here that you want, you can create a completely custom field for it. And then you get different views to view your space in. So list is always the default, and that's what we're looking at back here, but I'll go back to that in a second. And then if you like the Kanban style, that's what the board is for. So you can tick that on or you can turn it off. And then calendar, that's another option. So if you want all of those on, you can have all of them. If you only want the list view, you can have just the list view. But we're going to create it with those right now so that you can see when this space pops up, you would just go here and you would create a new folder.

[00:13:08.250] - Steph Blake
And then it automatically creates a list for you within there. And see, it also created the board view. So let's go back to this blog example that I created, and you can see that when I click Board View, you can see how there's boards here. So if you've used Trello in the past, this is very similar to that, where you can just simply drag and drop to different areas just depending on the status of the task. This is, List view is personally my favorite to use when it comes to different admin tasks, my business. But for content marketing, I definitely like the Board view just because it gives me an overview. Let me collapse these so you can see. It just gives you a really easy way to see where everything's at just at a glance. You can also collapse these. The to-do and the complete are just general statuses that it gives you once you start out. And then you can customize it from there. But yeah, I really like this view. I think it just makes things really, really easy. But let's add a couple of different views just to see what they look like.

[00:14:25.490] - Steph Blake
We can add a calendar view. When we go back and assign, let's assign a due date to this so you can see what it looks like. The cool thing about ClickUp is that you can do a start date and an end date or a due date. Let's do a start date of today and then an end date. We're saying that our project will take about five days to complete, but it's due on Friday, the 31st. We're going to close that. Then once we go to the calendar view, you can see that it popped up right here. You know that you have slotted out the time in your calendar to work on this project. I love using calendar view. I'm such a nerd. I love to color code and use different colors for different statuses so that when I do go to my calendar, everything is right there and really easy to see. Another option is the box view. I've created a sample space. Let me see. Let's see if it'll let me... Oh, there we go. It will let me do it. But you can see who is working on each project. If you have a team, it'll break this down for you.

[00:15:39.440] - Steph Blake
It'll say you and it'll say another team member here, another team member here, and it just breaks it down into every single person that's on your team and what they're working on. You can see where the different status is at for different projects, who is working on what. It's amazing, and it's a really easy way to just glance at something so you don't have to go back and forth and talk and ask them about it. Another one is the Gantt View, if you are familiar with Gantt charts. It breaks it down right here for you, too. There's a lot of different options that you can choose from, and these are completely customizable for each of your folders. If I go down to February, you can see that there's only the list and the board view. But when I go up to January, it has all of them here. You can customize it however you want for your business. Another thing that is very, very cool is the page views. We're going to talk about these for just a quick second. I personally love Docs. This has replaced Google Docs for me just because it's so easy to keep everything in one place.

[00:16:58.300] - Steph Blake
So you can change the name of this to be blog docs. I don't know. We'll just call it that for right now. And then within here, you can have different pages. So we'll call it page one, page two, page three. So see how everything is just in one very easy to access space. You don't have to go back and forth. You don't have to open up multiple tabs. Everything is in here for you. With that said, if you do prefer to use Google Docs, that's great. I created a little example here for us. I'm going to copy that. I'm going to show you how the embed feature works, which is also pretty cool. You can embed URLs right here, or you can also embed HTML. If you use Airtable, or Typeform, Spotify, Miro, Google Maps, any of those work right here, you just have to pull the HTML and each platform shows you how to do that. But in this instance, we are going to just look at Google Docs. I'm going to say, Create, and it takes a second here, but you can see that it literally pulls in that Google Doc for you.

[00:18:21.550] - Steph Blake
I'm typing right now. You can see that it pulls it in right there. So if I type in here, I'm typing again, you can see it pulls it into both places. So if, for example, you wanted to send this out to another team member to review or you wanted to look at it in Google Docs, whatever the reason, or if you just prefer Google Docs, you can quickly embed it in here so that you're keeping everything in one place. So that is one of my all time favorite features of ClickUp. You also have the conversation tool. So this is similar to Slack. They actually created this to be a replacement to Slack, I think. I'm almost 99 % sure. So you would just start a conversation with somebody in here. So you would just hit @ and then their name, and it would pop up right here just like it does in Slack if you've used that before. And you could send it. I don't even know if it'll... Yeah, it will let me send. And then you can just have a conversation going right in here, too. The final feature that you can use are forms.

[00:19:42.060] - Steph Blake
So these are really cool, too, because this gets rid of the need for Google Forms or Airtable Forms or really any other form. You would just drag these in here for whichever items you wanted. You also have the ability to create custom fields. You have all of these options that you can choose from. We can say, What is your name? We can add that in there. So when we view it, you can see it has the items that we added in there. So you can pull the premade task fields that you already had, or you can add your own to make them completely custom. So very, very cool. Literally, so many ways to use this. And this is just one of the reasons why I'm so obsessed with it because of the flexibility. And I'm also somebody that loves to have everything in one place. So this makes it really, really easy to do that. Another one of my favorite feature. I just have so many favorite features. It's really hard to say what I love the most. But a really cool one is Inbox. So this is what it sounds like. This is your inbox.

[00:21:00.020] - Steph Blake
This shows you everything that is assigned to you that you have to do. So this is what I have assigned to myself to complete today. And you could see when you hover over, it tells you that it starts today for this blog post project. If I say that I am done with it, if I hover over the status bar right there and I say complete, it will get rid of it. We're going to ignore that. But say I wasn't able to get to this and I want to change to tomorrow, for example, I will close that out. And then if I hit next... Well, you can see other items that I have to work on for my business, I wasn't meaning to show that, but it looks like it pulled it in there. So you can see that it shows you other items that you have assigned to do. And then once items are done, they will all move to that section right there. You can also see items that you've delegated to other people. So if you are wondering if somebody was working on a project, you can do that. If you have unscheduled items, you can find all of those right here, and then you can assign due dates to those.

[00:22:16.820] - Steph Blake
And you have to keep in mind that the only time that something will be added to your inbox is when it is assigned to you. So even if you are a solopreneur and you don't have any team members in your business, you want to make sure that you are assigning all of those tasks to yourself. So let's walk through how to do that really quickly. So once you are in a folder, you'll see that you have your different lists, and within those, you have your tasks. Right here, it says the Assignee. So you can click on that and then assign it to yourself. It should automatically assign it to you, but you also have the capability to turn that off. So if you have a team, I prefer to or I suggest turning it off just because you will be assigning multiple tasks to different people. And if you are assigning it to yourself every time, that's just an extra time that you have to click it to turn it off and then assign another person to do it. So it just saves you one step. Another cool thing are favorites. So I really love favorites because it gives you an easy way to quickly access your most popular items or things that you need to be doing.

[00:23:32.470] - Steph Blake
So the way that you create your favorites in the bar over here is you click the ellipses on the view that you want. So we're just going to use the list view as an example. We're going to click the ellipses right there and we're going to say add to favorites. Click save and you could see it is on our favorites. But maybe we want the board view in there, too. So we're going to say add to favorites, and we'll call this board. So you can see that we have the list view and then we have the board view in there, too. And you can do this with anything that's in your space. So any view that you want, you just have to make sure that you assign it from the actual view up here by clicking that ellipses. One other thing that I wanted to quickly mention was this little button down here. So once you hover over it, it brings up this menu so you can create a new task from there, and it will just ask you which list you want to put it into. So we'll say January. This is an example.

[00:24:48.990] - Steph Blake
This is the description. This is where your task name goes. So we'll say 1:20 blog post. And you say, Create task. And we can see there it is. And it automatically defaults to the to-do section right here, and then you can move it to the different status that you want. Alternatively, you can... Actually, never mind. Forget that. What I was going to say is that you can choose the status from here, but I believe they don't have that feature yet. But what you can do is you can add different subtasks to it if you want to, or also add checklist, which is really cool. There's also the reminder function. So if you don't need an actual task, but maybe you need a reminder to, I don't know, take the garbage out, whatever it is, you can put that in there so that it will take garbage out. And it's assigned to me. So when I hit Save, you will see that it pops up in my inbox. So you can also create the reminders up here, garbage out again. So you can create the reminders right there or from this little area down here. The third item on here is your notepad.

[00:26:17.250] - Steph Blake
So you can create different notes. And then within there, it's literally just a virtual notepad. So you can just write whatever you want. Oh, test. Well, this is a test note. So once you go back, you could see it's right there. So if you had a really brilliant idea and you wanted to write it down before you forgot, you can easily and quickly do that right there. But now I just want to walk through just some best practices in terms of using ClickUp as a blogger. So I'm going to get rid of that example that I created. So when it comes to content creation, I think that the easiest... Well, I know that the easiest way, at least for me, is to create a folder with the month. And this just helps to keep things separated and easy for you to digest, because if you have too many things going on at once, then you're just going to get overwhelmed, honestly. And then within those folders, you have the different lists for the sections.

[00:27:28.890] - Steph Blake
Of.

[00:27:29.810] - Steph Blake
Your blog, the different topics that you talk about, however you refer to it. And then within those, you have your tasks. So our example right here is affiliates. So within the task right here, the name of the task is the date that it will go live. And then we have the name of the post next to it. So we can say ClickUp Review. Let's just say that. And then in the description, you can put whatever you want. So if you want to keep track of all of your keywords in here, if you want to link to that Google Doc, you can do that as well. I had to take a drink of water real fast. If you want to link to sites that you're going to backlink to, you can include those there as well. Whatever information is helpful to you and that you typically use when you're creating your post. Another thing that you can do is you can create different subtasks. So if you have tasks that you want to assign to yourself to get this done, we'll just say, write copy, whatever all of the tasks are. I would suggest creating a template, which I did right here.

[00:28:51.630] - Steph Blake
So I create a template and it includes everything in there. So then you can just easily duplicate that every single time. We have that, we have that. We have write, copy, research, post to blog, design, graphics for social media, whatever all of those tasks are, put all of those in as subtasks first, and then you will just duplicate that every time. So you can duplicate that by you have your template, click your ellipses, and then you say duplicate. I like to duplicate everything just to be safe. You would just call it the name. Just change that to the name. You will duplicate it, and then you can see it is right here. So then you can move it to whichever spot that you want. So it's in development, outline completed. Just continue moving these wherever they are in the process. And that's why I like to use the board view because it's just so easy to drag and drop, honestly. And it's easier to see and just conceptualize for me personally in the board view than it is in the list view. I don't know. But maybe you prefer the list view, which is great.

[00:30:14.260] - Steph Blake
Just do whatever works for you and what makes sense to you. Another way that you can use it for blogging is to keep track of affiliates. So I would suggest creating a list. Maybe you name this, StockPhotosites, and you create different categories based on your affiliates. You have one for software, StockPhotosites software. Then within those, you would put the name of the stock photo site here. Then within there, you can put the affiliate URL. If somebody asks you for it or you're including it in a post, you can just quickly come down here, grab the link, and embed it in. One other thing, I know we quickly talked about this, but say, for example, you have your post here and you want to assign something to a team member. What you can do, once you're in the subtask, their name would pop up right here. So after you add them to the space, you would just select them right there, and then their face would pop up right here. So like I said, that is just the tip of the iceberg. When it comes to talking about ClickUp, there are so many ways that you can use it, so many different ways that you can customize it for your business.

[00:31:37.500] - Steph Blake
I hope this was helpful to help you get started.

[00:31:40.810] - Steph Blake
And then finally, you are going to date it. So now you're going to assign due dates to every single thing that you've outlined. And this will help ensure that you always have a plan in place from the moment that your feet hit the ground in the morning. So let's recap everything that we have talked about. So throughout this training, we have talked about the importance of using a digital project management tool in your business and how that pretty printed planner just isn't cutting it, why automations are so important for creating scalability both for your clients and your business. Because let's be real, you can only do so much and you only have so much time in the day. So the more that you can automate and get your time back, the more that you can scale your business and grow. And you also learned how to create a system that ensures you make up, you make sure to wake up knowing exactly what to work on each morning with your digital project management tool. You have been given tangible tips that you can start using right away, which is great. I just wanted to say thank you for coming to hang out with me at this training.
