Welcome to this advanced email marketing presentation titled How to Pitch Offers through Email and Earn Money on Autopilot.

[00:00:17.290] - Allea
But first, I want to introduce myself. I'm an email marketing strategist and conversion copywriter. I help online business owners make a killer first impression using welcome and nature sequences that engage readers, build brand loyalty and optimize conversions for sales and site traffic. I help my clients build intentional relationships with their new subscribers by using email marketing to connect readers with the best resources and solutions that they have to offer.

[00:00:44.110] - Allea
My background's in advertising and actually got started an online marketing as a blogger back in 2016 as I continued to learn the ropes, running a blog and creating content. It became really clear how email marketing is a sustainable and engaging way to connect with readers long term.

[00:01:02.440] - Allea
So I work with clients, including food bloggers, money bloggers, product and course creators and membership communities to create tailored strategic sequences that promote products in content that readers both love and engage with.

[00:01:15.850] - Allea
So you are here today if you want to create intentional automated sales emails that make it easy for your readers to know what you offer, how it helps them, and why it's important that they take action. This presentation will be most helpful to you if you have an offer that is valuable to your audience in your business, whether the goal is for you to build credibility, boost revenue or increase page views, not all sales sequences are selling a paid offer.

[00:01:43.210] - Allea
We are selling an action or a response so offers could include paid products, affiliate, partner products, services, webinar trainings, free content like blog post, podcasts, PDF resources or videos, really anything that could help make your readers life easier, more enjoyable or lead to a positive change in their life.

[00:02:08.890] - Allea
So takeaways you can expect to learn today are why sales copy is different from what you usually write for blog content or social media. What key points need to be defined before you write a sales email, two framework's you can use to create one off emails to promote free low barrier offers. One advanced email strategy for providing valuable content throughout a sales sequence that complements and leads up to a high value offer and how to sell with email marketing automation's without feeling sleazy or manipulative.

[00:02:44.800] - Allea
Everything I'm going to teach you today can be sent to your list automatically using ongoing nurture sequences or ""sales funnels"", which would be sent out following your welcome sequence. This means your new subscribers will learn about your offers on auto pilot versus requiring you to pitch them through live launches or one off broadcasts. Readers will know you and your brand before you've made a pitch, so you will be a credible source they can trust and you'll experience recurring sales or continued traffic to your site.

[00:03:19.360] - Allea
First, let's start by introducing conversion copywriting. Conversion copywriting is different from content writing and that the goal is to move readers to act. The goal is to convert them to click, buy, engage or share. Conversion copywriting uses proven persuasion techniques paired with knowledge and understanding of your audience to make an informed and intentional strategy. So what makes conversion copywriting work? The value you provide outweighs what you want or ask from your subscribers. So the rule of thumb here is to send three value based emails for every one hard pitch email in a sales campaign.

[00:04:02.440] - Allea
Also, you know what your reader is struggling with and you can speak to their needs and desired outcomes. So it's more than just throwing an offer out to hundreds of inboxes and hoping people will want it. You need to know the humans behind the email addresses. And with conversion copywriting, you're clear about the benefits of your offer to your subscriber. This kind of goes with the last point. But yes, even if it feels like a big accomplishment for you, like launching a book or course, we have to fight the natural instinct to make it about us.

[00:04:37.060] - Allea
It's always about the reader and the positive change they can experience.

[00:04:42.220] - Allea
So think to yourself, why does this matter to them? How does this solve their problem? And lastly, you explicitly state when your readers should take action, smart, clear calls to action make it easier for your reader to know their next step and reduces the fatigue of figuring it out on their own.

[00:05:02.420] - Allea
OK, so how do you find out about this information from your audience? Of course, while you may think that you know, everything there is to know about your audience, because you spend day in and day out serving them or working with them. There's also the other end of the spectrum where maybe you feel like you don't have a clue what they want or why they're even on your list. But either way, I will always suggest one simple thing.

[00:05:26.200] - Allea
Ask. That there are all sorts of tools at your disposal, like surveys I use foureyes. But Google forms would work, use polls on your Instagram stories, prompt questions on your social media posts, and meet one on one for a brief call with somebody from your ideal audience, maybe somebody who's purchased from you before or somebody who's on your list but hasn't purchased. So you can learn more about their thought process and really get into the details of what they were thinking.

[00:05:55.720] - Allea
At this point, we are not simply asking for demographics or preferences. We want to know why they chose to take action, what other alternatives they considered, what sets you or your product or service apart in their minds from your competition and the ultimate outcome that they experience as a result.

[00:06:20.330] - Allea
So, as promised, I'm going to introduce three time tested conversion focus copywriting formulas, I'm going to introduce you to two email framework strategies that are fine for one off emails, and then I'll go into a more advanced strategy for more high ticket offers. All three are great for incorporating sales content into your nurture sequence or automated campaigns.

[00:06:43.850] - Allea
First, let's start with a strategy for smaller, low barrier offers. I'll share two frameworks you can use. I'll cover these briefly, but I want to make sure you know about them since they're really easy to implement. Both are great for gaining site traffic by leading subscribers to free content like blog posts, trial affiliate offers, resources, videos on YouTube and the like. So this one is called the AIDA Email Framework. And here's what it includes. First, we start with attention.

[00:07:15.020] - Allea
The start of your email needs to hook your reader in from the start. This can be done well by using stories, maybe a startling fact, a confession or a hot take. Then we move into interests, we want to keep your subscribers reading by telling them more juicy facts or the details of a story, this is followed by desire. We want to connect everything you've shared so far with how it applies to them personally. This is when we build more emotion into the email.

[00:07:43.350] - Allea
And finally, action at this point. Ask your readers to take the next step to click, reply or buy so it's easy for them to continue their engagement.

[00:07:54.480] - Allea
To show you how this works out, I actually have an example of my own that I can share with you. This is an email that I sent to my list before.

[00:08:02.220] - Allea
So following that structure, attention, interest, desire and action. Let's start here. So as far as attention, I mean, I'm using a gif that's part of it, but also telling them, like you, here on my email is about to find out my big ol' secret, a peek behind the curtain over here at duett and how I managed to nurture my new subscribers without doing more work. You have my attention. Tell me more about how I can do more with less work.

[00:08:30.150] - Allea
Right. And then interest is part of this here. Part of the attention and interest kind of goes together. I'm telling them it's going to make your life in business easier, too. So let's talk about the desire, because I want them to not just blindly trust me, my readers, I want them to really understand why this matters. So to build the best relationships we can with their subscribers, we need to make sure all these subscribers get a kick.

[00:08:56.820] - Allea
Welcome to your e-mail list, say a hi. Hello. And here's how I want to help you. You want to share the best advice, resources or products. You have to help new subscribers solve their problems sooner than later. And we want to introduce your new subscribers to your online ecosystem. So they're caught up in all the things you have or do to support them. So that, yes, I desire that as a reader. I want my subscribers to get that kind of experience.

[00:09:23.880] - Allea
So then we just have to ask them to act. So that feels like a lot. But here's where my workflow comes in and I'm sharing a link to a Podcast that I've been on. So we have attention, interest, desire, all of that leading up into here. It doesn't have to be necessarily broken up into lots of individual pieces at this point. I'm talking about the desire that you have. It's like, no, I'm trying to work up an emotion in you, but this is like I'm promising them some sort of relief because I have this workflow that will help them and then hitting on a little bit more of a desire of like, yeah, you're right, I'm connecting my brain to my heart.

[00:10:00.570] - Allea
That relief makes sense. And you've got a system for me. Yes. I want to click through. Please let me listen to this Podcast.

[00:10:08.830] - Allea
Next is the e-mail framework, this can also be used for sales pages and here's what it includes. First, we start with the problem your reader is facing. We start by identifying a problem they're struggling with at the start of the email. Then through agitation, we drive home the problem with a few more details to really get at the emotion and agitate how they feel about this problem.

[00:10:34.600] - Allea
So if something's unfair, let this section really hit that home. If something is annoying them, give examples to show that you understand. Finally, we wrap this up with a solution. Don't just leave your reader hanging in an emotional state, provide a relief for the problem, and ask readers to engage with the next step to click through to a blog post to learn more or reply to this email to engage with you or watch a video training. So what you've just done is you get their mind prepared and give them the needed context to really show how valuable it is to engage with your offer.

[00:11:12.730] - Allea
Now, to make sense of this framework, I want to show you another example of an email that I sent out to my list. Let's pull it up here. And at this point, we are talking about problem, education and solution. Right? So let me read this email with you. So, hey there. If you spend any amount of time on the Internet? You know that things are always changing tools, trends, even ideas to keep up with these changes.

[00:11:35.860] - Allea
I've done a lot of switching and swapping of things in my business, like moving my email marketing from MailerLite to Convertkit updating the free PDF resources I share on my site, giving tutorial videos to make sure their up to date. But I ran into two problems when it came to updating my resources or tutorials.

[00:11:52.780] - Allea
So I'm positioning this from my right.

[00:11:55.940] - Allea
This is my agitation and I'm hoping that they will also identify with this. So then that's the problem and then I'm agitating it here. But I ran into two problems when it came to updating my resources or tutorials. One, tracking down all the links. I didn't want to ever have to go back and find each and every link to my free resources in order to replace it with the new one and to forget about it, never updating things at all because that's too much work and instead letting my resources rot away into the Internet landfill of outdated materials.

[00:12:28.300] - Allea
Nope, neither of those options work for me. I've agitated like this is how much work it would be if you just keep going with what you're doing. Or the other option is that your resources just get outdated on the Internet and nobody wants that either. So then the solution. So I decided to invest a little time and energy and create a system that would make it super simple to share a resource now, but be able to easily update it later.

[00:12:54.340] - Allea
So how do I do it? Click through to this blog post to find out.

[00:12:59.420] - Allea
And now for offers, the required time or money will expand on the strategy by using the P-A-S-O-P or PASOP strategy, PASOP up is an advance strategy that helps you lead up to a larger pitch of a product or action where you really want people to engage, especially if it will require their time or money, like a webinar or a paid product. So this strategy works great for promoting a specific product or program, encouraging sign ups for a webinar or event, and leading up to a high ticket affiliate product.

[00:13:38.390] - Allea
In a way, the sequence serves as a mini evergreen ""launch"" once added to your ongoing automated nurture content. So what is the PASOP of strategy? Well, I learned about the strategy from Joanna Weeve got copyhackers.com, so you can find more resources as well as this one over on her website. And you can use this link or you can search for PAS formula and her site should come up. So let's break this down a bit more, even though some of it is a repeat of the strategy we already talked about.

[00:14:10.880] - Allea
First present, a problem your audience is experiencing, then agitate that problem in a really empathetic way. So they really feel the emotion of it. Next, provide a solution to the problem and do your best to answer it in the email versus linking to related resources.

[00:14:28.640] - Allea
Then we're going to pair that solution with an outcome that's possible for them too. We're kind of painting this picture of a desired outcome and potential results.

[00:14:39.530] - Allea
And then before we wrap up the email, tee up another problem they may be experiencing, then tell them you'll be addressing that issue in the next email, in copywriting that's called an open loop. It says, hey, come back for more. Keep an eye out, things like that. So do all of this in three to four emails with the final email only focusing on the PAS like we covered before. And so that final solution would be your offer.

[00:15:05.910] - Allea
Now, let's go into an example so this can make a little bit more sense from a high level view. It'll look like this. So the first email will be all five parts of PASOP. You are the problem, agitation, solution, the outcome, whether it's measurable or you're telling a story and then you're teeing up the new problem. Email two you would repeat the problem that you ended with at the end of email one and then you agitate that, provide a solution, share a potential outcome and then take up another problem.

[00:15:38.090] - Allea
So you can do this in two or three emails. And then on the last email, you just focus on the PAS. Like I mentioned, you repeat the problem, you end it on an email to you'll agitate that. And then your offer is the big solution. With a link to the sales page, learn more about the solution and the outcome it brings. So this is where you would really hit home with click here for this affiliate offer to make sense of everything that we've talked about, all those struggles, all that agitation.

[00:16:06.410] - Allea
This is the solution and this is where you link to it. So these first two emails, two or three emails leading up to that final pitch, if you will, it's really priming their minds to be thinking about this, to become aware of this agitation and this emotion. So that way, when you produce the offer and say, I have a solution for you, they've been thinking about it and they're like, you're right. This is a problem that I need to solve.

[00:16:31.070] - Allea
And they'll be grateful that they have the opportunity to take part in the offer that you have presented. Again and to remind you that this content is not mine. It has been sourced from copyhackers.com, I want to give Joanna all the credit here. And so feel free to click on that link for more options and opportunities for copywriting in sales and conversion techniques. So why does this strategy work? Well, you were giving space in the sale sequence to address major pain points.

[00:17:01.880] - Allea
You're asking questions. You're answering questions. You're kind of bringing these things to light that subscribers might already be thinking and you're providing mindset issues or bringing them to light that really need to be worked out for any number of things that subscribers need to think, do or believe before we can really ask them to act.

[00:17:20.390] - Allea
So the emails all flow together, piece together intentionally to work through one pain point at a time, like a stairstep of questions and answers that they need cleared up in their mind before your offer will make sense to them.

[00:17:34.670] - Allea
To help you better understand this concept, I'm going to share two examples for two different types of offers so you can really see it in action.

[00:17:42.650] - Allea
First, here's an example for a money blogger. In this example, say you're selling a paid training that talks all about how investing works from a high level. Let's look at the journey a subscriber could go through before realizing that, yes, this would be a helpful training for me to feel confident, understanding, investing, because they don't just appear there to walk them through it. So for our core three problems over the course of our emails, the first one is going to address this problem, if you will, or this misbelief that investing is risky and so they aren't even investing.

[00:18:17.330] - Allea
Number two would be that investing is something that you think you have to pay other people for to do for you and that you'd rather just let them do it and not ask any questions. And number three, they're still not sure that they can learn investing well enough, coupled with the opportunity cost of not becoming an informed investor. So at this point, they're like, why try? But we want to couple that with a problem of like, if you don't become an informed investor, there's problems there.

[00:18:44.480] - Allea
So these are the core problems. Another way you could pose this would be thinking, what is it that they have to believe in each of these emails? So you could go with what is the solution? What is the outcome? What is the one thing that we need to sell them on thinking by the end of this email? That's also another way you could frame this up, but we'll dive in with these problems, starting with email one.

[00:19:04.970] - Allea
So with the problem, it's that investing is risky. So you, the reader you're right into hey, you you're not investing because you think it's too risky. Right. And that's a problem because this means you either don't have retirement or savings or you don't have a strategy that will allow you to retire the way that you want. That's a problem.

[00:19:24.350] - Allea
The solution is that in this email, you could teach about two different approaches to investing. You could tell them about how they can DIY it or how they can have it actively managed. So hiring an adviser and the outcome is that people who've taken the time to learn how investing works have experience more confidence to make a plan for retirement that gives them peace of mind. So whether it's DIY or actively managed. And so the problem that we're setting up next is don't assume investing is something you must pay other people for to do for you.

[00:19:54.860] - Allea
And so we can tee it up saying to be a smart investor, you still have to know a few important things.

[00:20:01.850] - Allea
So then we get the email to where the first problem is thinking investing is something that you have to pay other people to do for you. And so we agitate that by saying, what's the danger of thinking in this way? We need to hit this over the head of like you limit your understanding and involvement in your own retirement plan. Plus, there are ways that you can DIY your investments and save on fees if that's what's holding you back. But there's a danger to just assuming that you have to pay other people to do it or you're not doing it at all.

[00:20:31.910] - Allea
So a solution here would be to introduce index funds and how it's really not as risky as you might think. And you could do it yourself.

[00:20:39.440] - Allea
You don't have to pay somebody else to do it for you.

[00:20:42.230] - Allea
The outcome could be, you can DIY invest with very little money up front. Here are a few different places you could do that. And then teeing up the next problem. Still think investing is something you can't fully understand.

[00:20:55.220] - Allea
So at this point, if they're still thinking I have to pay someone else to do it, otherwise it's risky. I'm not going to have retirement. They're aware of all these problems. Right. So we're saying, but tomorrow I'll show you how to be a smart investor, even without a degree in finance to help you better understand all of this. So finally, we get to email three. The problem here is still think investing is something you can't fully understand, because at this point, they know that they need to understand it.

[00:21:19.610] - Allea
But now they're thinking, can I really understand this? So we agitate that by asking or presenting to them. What do you miss out on by not understanding the elements of investing, sort of proposing the opportunity cost. And this is where you would get into the details of money being saved for the future or for your kids college or education or whatever it is that they might want to save up for, what their retirement could look like. They're kind of in the dark and that's not being a smart investor.

[00:21:48.920] - Allea
So we tell them with the solution, become a smart investor without a degree in finance.

[00:21:53.810] - Allea
Learn how investing works. You can gain more control over your finances, become an informed investor, whether you are DIY in your retirement and investing or you're hiring someone to help you manage it. But overall, we know that it's important for you to have a little bit more clarity and drive, if you will, to at least know what's happening with your retirement investments. So the call to action here would say by the training here to learn everything in a clear, unintimidating way.

[00:22:21.560] - Allea
So if you wanted to propose this course differently, say the whole course is about DIY investing, you kind of have to hit on all of the things that they might already know about investing. And maybe they think it's only done in a traditional way. Right, with these actively managed accounts, and then that's another way that you could just tailor the course just specifically to how DIY investing is totally achievable. Here's how you do it. We teach you about it here or here's our resource, or here's this app that you can use.

[00:22:48.340] - Allea
But in this case, we're just sending them to an investing course. And they have a lot of these like major pain points that we need to hit on, investing is risky. They aren't investing at all, investing in something you think have to pay other people to do for you or they're not even sure that they can comprehend how this will work. And so we want to hit on all those before we pitch the next step for them, whether it's a course or a book or an affiliate program, the world is your oyster.

[00:23:14.540] - Allea
OK, now, to help regenerate this framework, let's look at a second example. This will be an example for a business blogger or a coach. So in this example we'll say that you're promoting a higher ticket affiliate product.

[00:23:27.550] - Allea
And the product itself is a course all about building your email list. So from a high level, let's look at the journey a subscriber would go through before saying, yes, this would be a helpful strategy for my online business. So the first problem could be telling them you're only building an audience on social media. But what if that platform goes away? You lose all of your followers. The second one would be worried the email marketing is too difficult to learn or implement.

[00:23:54.280] - Allea
And the third one is just telling them you're missing out. Email will make you more money in the long run, and it has a higher ROI on sales and purchases than any social platform. That's how we've got it framed out. Lets hop into what they would look like individually. So email one. You're only building an audience on social media.

[00:24:10.690] - Allea
That's a problem because what happens if that platform gets shut down or an algorithm makes it impossible for you to connect with your own followers. So the solution is consider how email marketing will be a better long term solution. So you never lose that connection or ability to talk with your audience when you want to. And so the outcome would be connecting with your audience at any time with no algorithms in the way. Teeing up the next problem if you're worried the email marketing is too difficult to learn or implement, I'll tell you why it's worth learning it in my email tomorrow.

[00:24:43.540] - Allea
So for email two, are you worried that email marketing is too difficult to learn or implement. I'll tell you why it's worth learning. It's important to nurture your subscribers who are the most interested and already on your list. You could agitate this by saying, like, if you're continually looking for new subscribers, you could waste less time and just better nurture the people on your list and do a better job of getting them to convert to sales versus always trying to find someone new to join your list.

[00:25:10.540] - Allea
This is another big thing where people think I have to have this huge email list in order for it to be worth it.

[00:25:16.150] - Allea
And this is saying no, like you can just nurture the few people you have really well and see more in sales than you would even with social media and a huge platform.

[00:25:24.220] - Allea
Then the solution could be with simple planning and forethought. It's actually quite easy to make email a regular part of your marketing, and the outcome would be that you're building a loyal following of subscribers who are the first to buy from you when you have an offer or a promotion.

[00:25:38.680] - Allea
And then lastly, we tee it up saying you are missing out on sales revenue if you're not using email. So this is where in the third email we would get into a little bit more of the fact the email is proven to have a greater ROI than social platforms and can make you more money in the long run. So the solution would be start growing your email list and build a loyal fan base who'll buy from you easier and faster than followers on any other platform.

[00:26:03.370] - Allea
This leads into your call to action to purchase this email list building course to get started.

[00:26:08.140] - Allea
So now that you have an understanding of the copywriting frameworks for working with, let's go back and really focus on your offer in your audience to determine what should be in your sale sequence.

[00:26:19.540] - Allea
Clarity is key before copywriting. Not everything under the sun needs to be in your sales sequence. So I'll work through some prompts to help you clarify the main points before you start copywriting. First review and clarifying your offer. What problem does your offer solve? What if happy users of your product or service said about your offer? Look through those to see what problems your product or offer is actually solving. You can ask them these questions in a survey or hop on a call with a couple of your users or students or customers and ask yourself, are you saving them time and money?

[00:26:58.810] - Allea
Or if you're a food blogger, are your recipes helping them adjust to a new gluten free diet? What is the ultimate outcome that people are looking for? Who is your offer for? Your offer is not going to be for everyone. Maybe it makes sense to send it to one part of your list, but not the other. So when you segment your list in your welcome sequence include your relevant offer in each follow up nurture sequence that it makes sense for.

[00:27:26.290] - Allea
For example, if you have a cooking for beginners nurture sequence, you'll share a different offer there, like a ""how to start cooking starter kit"" then you  would for the people who are pro home chefs, right? So they're in that sequence, they might need to get more advanced meal planning strategies. Secondly, identify important characteristics about your audience. What is your audience currently struggling with? What have they gone to looking for a new solution? This will ultimately identify their big pain points, and that might seem dramatic, right?

[00:28:01.490] - Allea
If you're a food blogger or money blogger, but what is it they're looking for? Are they short on time? Are they frustrated with people talking over them at work about investing or they don't know how to use their 401k? Right. If that's what their big pain point is, identify that. Then explore what other alternatives have they tried and what reservations might they have before trying your solution? What do they need to believe is possible? What fears are keeping them from true buy-in on your offer and we'll kind of come back to this again.

[00:28:37.760] - Allea
But what is their desired outcome? What are the results that they think they're looking for? Revisit your offer. How does what you have to offer help them get to this outcome easier, faster, or maybe with less stress or anxiety?

[00:28:55.340] - Allea
Lastly, consider how you will close the gap for your subscribers.

[00:29:00.620] - Allea
What does your audience need to know or learn before they can fully participate in your offer? You can often repurpose super valuable content. You already have to help support your subscribers as they move along this journey in this transformation. So, for example, if you're teaching a DIY course, they have to believe that it's worth learning so they can successfully do it themselves. If you're offering an affiliate program, what should they know about your affiliate partner to gain trust in them too, what are the most commonly asked questions you can solve for them proactively?

[00:29:36.230] - Allea
You can answer these questions by linking to existing content or repurposing blog content into an email or repurpose email content that you've sent out or shared before, or provide case studies, even presenting these kind of pain points or mental blocks as common myths, is really helpful because then you turn around and you get to bust those myths and why they should keep considering to move forward through the transformation and engage with each email and ultimately your offer.

[00:30:06.740] - Allea
So I hope your mind is turning with all sorts of strategies for how you can organize your email content in a way that supports what your subscribers need and makes it really clear how your offer solves their problems or makes their life easier. Incorporate these email strategies into your ongoing automated nurture sequences so that you're making sure everyone knows about your valuable offers after they've been introduced to your brand through your welcome sequence, and so that your email sequence is consistently solving problems for new subscribers, building trust in your brand, and positioning you as a resource for help and direction.

[00:30:45.710] - Allea
Plus, by incorporating this, your subscribers are being led to your offer and having their major fears or pain points resolved before the pitch. Lastly, your ongoing sale sequence boosts traffic to or revenue from your products on autopilot. So now that you know how to incorporate valuable content into your automated sales sequences, you can do this in a way that sets up your offer to be an obvious solution to your subscribers. You're clear about the benefits of your offer to your subscriber, and you've made those front and center in your explicitly stating when your readers should take action on the next step by using a clear call to action and making it really easy for them to click through.

[00:00:12.690] - Allea
Okay, you built an email list, now what? So, I'm going to be talking about how to take back control of your email marketing in five steps. So, if email marketing has been on your to-do list, this session will give you clear, intangible strategies to clean, segment, and maximize your relationship with your subscribers. While you've built your list, you've maybe also neglected it.

[00:00:37.480] - Allea
So, as a result, maybe you're not sure who's on your list anymore. Maybe you're not sure what they're interested in. You have no clear segments. You think there's probably a lot of unengaged people who are costing you money every month and your open and clickt hrough rates aren't what they used to be. I am curious if any of these resonate with you, go ahead and drop them in the chat.

[00:00:57.750] - Allea
While this video is not live, I am here watching with you to answer your questions. So, do any of these resonate with you? If so, drop them in the chat. But this is why we are here today. In this session, I'm going to give you those five strategies for reviving and getting the most out of your email marketing.

[00:01:16.690] - Allea
First, I'd like to introduce myself. I'm Allea Grummert. I'm an email marketing strategist and conversion copywriter. I have a company called duett. I help online business owners, largely content creators like bloggers, make a lasting first impression with email subscribers through a welcome and nurture sequence.

[00:01:36.010] - Allea
So, I do that in order to engage readers, build brand loyalty, and optimize conversions for sales inside traffic. So, my background is action advertising and I got my start in online marketing when I started my personal finance blog called Ask Alley back in 2016. So, as I continued to learn the ropes of running a blog and creating content, it became really clear how email marketing is a sustainable and profitable way to connect with your audience long term. So, today, like I promise, I'm going to give you these strategies to help you take back control of your email list. What are they?

[00:02:12.430] - Allea
The first, establishing your brand purpose through a welcome sequence and promote your top content like blog posts, products and affiliates on autopilot. We're going to talk about segmenting your list for higher conversion rates and revenue. We're going to talk about cleaning up your list by removing those unengaged subscribers and ultimately create a consistent schedule for emailing your list. So, I am curious, which of these five strategies are you looking forward to? Which one stands out to you?

[00:02:44.220] - Allea
Which one are you most excited to learn about? Drop that in the comments. Let me know. Even if you only apply one of these things from today's session, just know that it's going to give you a much needed boost for your email marketing strategy. So, you don't have to do them all.

[00:02:58.560] - Allea
Even just one will be really impactful for what you're doing. We have a lot to cover though, so let's dive in. We want to create a clear picture of your brand, who you are, what you do, why this benefits your readers through an automated welcome sequence. What is a welcome sequence? Well, the welcome sequence is a proper immediate email welcome that connects subscribers with the heart of your brand and states what they should expect while being on your email list.

[00:03:30.340] - Allea
It's a really formal definition. I made it up myself. But ultimately, the welcome sequence is what subscribers will receive first, right after they join your email list, before they start getting your regular newsletters. It's automated, so you know that no matter how someone joins your list or when they join your list, they'll get this. And this sequence is anywhere from, it can be a simple one email welcome.

[00:03:54.420] - Allea
It could be three to five emails, anywhere in that range. But what it's doing is making your brand really, really clear in the eyes of your subscriber. Why is this important, a welcome sequence? Well, welcome sequence allows you to connect with new readers immediately when they're most interested in what you have to offer. It creates a valuable first impression.

[00:04:15.190] - Allea
It engages subscribers beyond them just getting their freebie and leaving. It also connects the dots for subscribers between where they are and where they could be by following along with you. And it also helps readers get acquainted with you, so they have context for what you'll do for them, why that matters, and what to look forward to receiving from you in the future. What should you include in your welcome sequence? First and foremost, make sure you're delivering your freebie.

[00:04:42.970] - Allea
Then I want you to introduce yourself. What is your mission? What will you help the subscriber do? What is your unique selling proposition? And why does this matter to the reader.

[00:04:53.970] - Allea
When they come to your site, what do you hope will change in their lives? And how are you going to be the person to help them experience that? So, what should you include in your welcome sequence? First of all, make sure you deliver the freebie if you've promised one. And then I want you to introduce yourself.

[00:05:09.300] - Allea
What's your mission? What will you help the subscriber do? What is your unique selling proposition and why does that matter to your reader? So, what are they coming looking for? What are they hoping for?

[00:05:21.220] - Allea
And how are you going to be the person that helps connect the dots for them? You can also share your top content. So, these could be blog posts, webinars, resources you want to make sure they have. Just wow the socks off of them and make them feel super welcome. I am curious if you want to drop in the chat, what's the number one freebie or content that you want every new subscriber to get from you?

[00:05:39.540] - Allea
What would make sure that they are like, heck yeah, this person knows what they're talking about and I want to keep learning from them. It also allows you to continue the connection, so you're able to cross promote. So, you're in your email marketing strategy, right? But you might also want them to follow you on TikTok or Instagram. This is a great place to include links for that.

[00:06:00.040] - Allea
And then we encourage them to follow you on other platforms as well. And once you write this, you can also ask your existing subscribers if they want your welcome sequence. You might not call it that, but say, hey, I created something new. That's a really great introduction to the kind of content you'll find on my site. If you'd like it, if you'd like to receive it, just click here and I'll get you at it.

[00:06:18.940] - Allea
It's that simple. Step Two. So your live broaddcast or newsletters send out your new content. But what if you could accomplish a similar thing, sending content to subscribers that's maybe older but still very valuable. You can actually create that similar experience through an automated nurture sequence. So, we're going to talk through why this is important and what you should actually send.

[00:06:43.390] - Allea
Nurturing your list is like a healthy pulse that keeps readers connected to you and your brand consistently. So, like I mentioned, your live broadcast or newsletter, that accomplishes on a regular basis. But now we're going to talk about how to make it automated. So, a nurture sequence is an automated email nurture sequence that sends out evergreen content to your new email subscribers, regardless of when they joined your list. I'm sharing this strategy as a way to send subscribers to your top blog content, affiliate promotions.

[00:07:13.620] - Allea
If you have a larger sales funnel, like you want to drive them to a webinar, or pitch a product, you can. And you can organize email content in either just one kind of catchall nurture sequence, or maybe you have two nurture sequences or four based on different verticals of the content you provide on your blog. We'll talk more about segmenting in a minute. But first, let's get back to your nurture sequence. These are awesome because they provide ongoing touches with your audience.

[00:07:39.940] - Allea
This way, new subscribers are regularly connected to your brand and your content. It's an opportunity to send consistent traffic back to your site and introduce them to top pages, posts, or products on your site, maybe category pages. Introduce the breadth of content that you have, and then you could also drill down into the depth of that content as well. It's a way for you to pitch products regularly.

[00:08:03.010] - Allea
This allows all new subscribers the opportunity to buy from you, or book a service, or call with you. And it keeps your audience warm and ready and primed for when you have a pitch or launch in the future. The last thing you want to do is wait until you have something to sell to them and reach out to your list. This is a way to stay connected with them, so that when you pitch something, it's not like, who's this person? Also, fun stat, nurtured leads actually make 47% larger purchases than those who are not nurtured.

[00:08:34.090] - Allea
So, it matters. So, I'm curious of all of these things, drop these at the chat. Which of these is most important to you? The ongoing touches, consistent traffic, pitching your services or products regularly, or keeping your audience warm? What should you include in this nurture sequence?

[00:08:52.870] - Allea
Let's dive down. It could be content largely that solves your readers biggest problems. If you were to be brand new to your site and people are coming with questions, what are those questions and how can you answer them through these emails? This could be your most popular content. Whether you find that out through Google Analytics or your YouTube videos with the most views, it could be your favorite content.

[00:09:14.290] - Allea
You're the expert. If you know that there are things on your site that, you're like, this would be so helpful to somebody. Or this is my favorite hack, or maybe it's part of your story. That's all important stuff that we can share with them in a nurture sequence. Then there's publicity or guest features. So, if you've been on a podcast or you wrote for a big magazine or a news source, you can include that here.

[00:09:38.250] - Allea
And what that does is it really lends to your credibility. You don't have to be braggy about it, but you can share it as a resource and in the minds of your readers, they're also going to see that as a credibility factor. Like this person knows what they're talking about. And like I mentioned, product pitches. So, these can be products of your own.

[00:09:54.460] - Allea
Or if you have affiliate partners that you want to pitch supporting that Amazon, you can't use Amazon affiliate links, but you could link to your Amazon storefront. You can also link to things like ButcherBox or depending on, like those bigger affiliates who don't have those kind of restraints on terms and conditions, you could pitch those. Step three, we're going to get a bit more advanced and discuss segmenting. We're going to talk about why segmenting your list of subscribers can actually lead to higher conversion rates and revenue. That's what I'm talking about.

[00:10:28.680] - Allea
First of all, what does it mean to segment? So, a segment is simply a group of subscribers organized based on a variety of settings. And those settings are typically tags. You could organize by like subscription day or if they've purchased something. But tags is what we're going to talk about.

[00:10:44.310] - Allea
Tagging, that's basically a way to track a subscriber's activity. So, how have they interacted with you? Have they clicked on a book a call link? Have they purchased something? Did they attend a webinar?

[00:10:55.090] - Allea
And then we're able to follow up with them on that. But what we're going to do is we're going to determine your segment based on these tags because it matters, like if they're a subscriber or if they click to say they're interested in something, that's all information we want to know, so we can send them really tailored information. These tools basically allow you to personalize the experience of each of your subscribers because it's based on whether they've interacted with you in a certain way or not. So, once you know a subscriber's preference or interest, you can send them a follow up sequence. So, a nurture sequence like what I just shared, or a sales funnel which just has a little bit of a different intention.

[00:11:36.340] - Allea
It's usually like a webinar of some sort, but either way, you want to make sure you're setting your content to the right people. If I type them in your list, we can make sure we are. It could be a nurture sequence like I mentioned, based on someone's interest or skill levels. Like for instance, I had a client who, they have a food blog, a really big food blog. And so, we segment their subscribers based on whether they are new to being a home cook or not.

[00:12:01.500] - Allea
If they're new, they get five additional ebooks that really educate them and get them excited to be in the kitchen and have the tools that they need, where everyone else just goes into a general nurture sequence. So, it's a way to create two different nurture sequences, same client, same email list, but they're getting a different experience. And like I mentioned, also a sales sequence to promote a specific, usually paid offer. By personalizing this followup, you're able to speak directly to the needs of each subscriber it's suitable for. So, if you imagine going back to that food blogging client, we're able to use really encouraging language in that beginner home cook sequence.

[00:12:37.480] - Allea
But if we use that in like a general nurture sequence, people might be like, please don't be kind of sending to me. [inaudible 00:12:41] around the blog. I know how to cut up a sweet potato. Whereas people are like, oh my goodness, I had no idea how to cut up an onion or a sweet potato. So that's what I mean by being able to personalize even the language in the emails because of what they've told you, that their skill level is where their interest is.

[00:12:58.710] - Allea
Why is it important to segment your list? I mentioned this but personalization attributes to higher conversion rates, that's higher click-throughs engagement and sales, as well as just a happier list of subscribers. And personalization just almost always performs better than generalized content. And actually, according to research for the Lyris Annual Email Optimizer Report, 39% of marketers who segmented their list had higher open rates, 28% had lower unsubscribe rates and 24% saw increased sales. So, in summary, happy subscribers open your emails, take action on your offers, and are just more favorably viewing your brand.

[00:13:39.990] - Allea
And that's what we want. So, how do you actually segment? And you're like, Allea, please don't just tell me to do this and not give me instructions. I got you. So, first, we're gonna get clear on your offer.

[00:13:50.660] - Allea
I say offer could be more than one, I'll explain. So, we need to start identifying what your offer is. You might not actually be selling a paid offer, but you might be. So, a paid offer would be something like a course, which looks more like a typical sales funnel, or if you have unpaid, it might be more like site traffic. And it's because you generate revenue through ads.

[00:14:13.500] - Allea
In summary, your offer could be a product, a digital course. It could be services. And like I mentioned, it could also be site traffic. So, things like blog posts, podcast, PDF resources, videos, things like that, in a way, is its own kind of offer, right? You're selling value.

[00:14:31.690] - Allea
So, I'm curious, if you want to comment below, what would you say is your offer? One thing to keep in mind, if you are focusing on site traffic, I want you to also keep in mind what content would you send to certain subscribers? So, this goes back to the blogging thing, right? They have beginners and more advanced folks.

[00:14:49.590] - Allea
I have another client who teaches on personal finance, so he's got investing, student loans, paying off debt, and earning more money. So, it's four different verticals, and as you can see, not all of those are super related. Somebody could test their student loan debt and not be interested in investing yet. So that in itself would be its own separate nurture sequence. Once you have your offer, what you know, what you're actually like selling, what are you going to send to them that lead them towards that offer?

[00:15:19.350] - Allea
So, you want to write your nurture sequence or sales model emails. These emails should encourage your readers to take action, and it should be something that takes them a step by step closer to learning more about your offer. That could look like them thinking about a topic related to your offer. It could be them registering for a webinar or clicking through to your site. But what steps can you lead them in to get them to do that action?

[00:15:42.300] - Allea
And it might not say, just come right out and say buy my thing, right? That's not really how it works. But how can you be getting them to think about it? Maybe taking action on reading a blog post related to a topic and then eventually down the line, you can pitch them on a paid offer. Before you can ask your list of self segments.,There are some techy things that we also need to address as well.

[00:16:01.750] - Allea
So, it's where you want to automate your sequence. Once you have your emails written, you really just want to create a tag for each of those nurture sequences, like beginner cook, general cook, something like that, or investing student loans, etc. And once you do that, you're going to set up an automation that adds that tag to a subscriber. And then once that tag is added, they get sent into that particular nurture sequence.

[00:16:26.590] - Allea
Then it's time to tell your list about it. Drop an email to your list and provide those subscribers with options to self-segment. Ask them, what are you most interested in? What can I send you information on next? And so, when they click it'll, add that tag, send them into their nurture sequence, and voila.

[00:16:44.440] - Allea
So, once you drop that email, make sure they have options to self-segment and then send that puppy out. I would say to fully implement this, I suggest you also add this email to your welcome sequence, so all new subscribers can get that kind of interaction. And then also, of course, send it to your existing subscribers as well. Step four is to clean up your list and remove your unengaged subscribers. So, if you've neglected your list for a while, there's a good chance there are some strangers on your list. So you don't know them, they might not remember you, and it's okay to let them go.

[00:17:17.100] - Allea
Why is it important to clean up your list? While your subscribers may have wanted your content at some point or another, they're no longer engaging for whatever reason. It doesn't mean that they didn't benefit from you while being on your list that whole time. It just means that they're not at that point anymore. But now these unengaged subscribers don't add any benefit to your community by being on your list.

[00:17:38.830] - Allea
They affect your data, like your open and click through rates and conversions, as well as your deliverability, like how efficiently your emails actually land in people's inboxes and not spam. They also impact with the cost of what you're paying for your email service provider. How do you find out, who these people are? Take a screenshot of this if you need to, but determine who your cold subscribers are. Either your email service platform will tell you, or you can go find out who hasn't clicked in an email in like 60 to 90 days.

[00:18:06.150] - Allea
Write a reengagement sequence. This could just be a simple two email sequence, but the goal being that you are trying to get them to click. If you can get them to click, they are engaged with you. And then you want to send just your cold subscribers through this new sequence, these two emails, and those at the end who didn't click anywhere at all, or any of your newer emails, they still haven't engaged with you.

[00:18:27.600] - Allea
It's good to go ahead and unsubscribe them. If you want, be sure to send yourself an export of that list in case you ever want to use it for any other reason. And then reuse the sequence every like, quarter or every six months, or even every year. However frequently, you would like to make sure you send people through this, it gives them an opportunity to engage with you one more time before they get removed. Allea, what do you put in this email sequence, I got you.

[00:18:52.350] - Allea
Ultimately, the goal is to reestablish a relationship with them, people who may have forgotten who you are and what you offer. So, I've got a few ideas for you here to share in these two, if not three, emails, I want you to reintroduce yourself. If your brand has changed or pivoted or your direction or niche has, make that really clear, and let them know. If you're not here for it, that's okay. You can unsubscribe.

[00:19:13.320] - Allea
But if you are here for it, stick around, more information is coming. Give them options to engage. So, instead of it just being a letter from you, link to things, so you could be linking to a free resource for training. Ask them if they need to update their email address and give them the link to do that, ask them to self-segment.

[00:19:31.000] - Allea
These are all great opportunities to get them clicking again. You can also explicitly state that you're cleaning up your list. And while you love emailing them, if they feel differently, it's okay to unsubscribe. Now, step five, much like blogging, emails produce better engagement when they're sent consistently. But if you're like a lot of bloggers, writing and sending your emails consistently is really hard to execute.

[00:19:58.110] - Allea
But I hope that this step will make the process easier for you. So, why does consistency matter? Well, email marketing allows you the time and space to create and maintain relationships with your readers over time. Regular emails help you and your brand stay top of mind because you keep showing up in their inbox. You'll maximize your resources by getting as many eyeballs as possible on your new content, right?

[00:20:21.730] - Allea
If your list is warm and you publish a blog post, you want people to see that, right? Email is a great way to do that. And then you need to be present with your subscribers between launches. So, if you're selling things, you can't just show up with a sale or a promotion and expect your list to jump at the opportunity and buy it, right. You're going to get more unsubscribed, especially if they don't remember who you are.

[00:20:40.120] - Allea
You might even get in their spam. So, what do you need in place to be able to do this? Decide. Decide what is consistent for you. Will this be two times a week?

[00:20:51.390] - Allea
Two times a month? When I was blogging on the side of my full-time job, it was two times a month. Now with my business, my goal is once a week. Sometimes it's more than that. But I'm curious.

[00:21:01.210] - Allea
I think this might be my last question. In the chat, go ahead and write down what is your commitment? What would consistent look like for you? You don't have to keep up with the Joneses, especially if you're new to blogging and you're like, I have a lot of other things to learn, and just make it a consistent pattern that will work for you. Then determine the topics you will write about in advance.

[00:21:21.750] - Allea
I use a content calendar and I also use like a content bank where I just put all of my ideas. So, QnAs that people ask on podcast, or if I'm at an event, I write down those things. And if I don't have blog posts about them, I go ahead and write them where I'll write emails about them and turn it into a blog post. That's my process. Then set aside time to write. So, I have time on my calendar for Thursday mornings to write next two Thursday's email. So, I give myself plenty of time to think on it to write.

[00:21:50.820] - Allea
And then I would also say, don't plan to like figure out what you're writing. Write the email, schedule it, and set it all out in one day. That doesn't work for a lot of people. So, if you're putting that pressure on yourself, kick it to the crew. And then lastly, I would say you can automate sending your new content through an RSS feed. If you're like, Allea, what's an RSS feed, look it up.

[00:22:11.530] - Allea
So, it will set out your brand new blog content to your subscribers, whatever days or the frequency that you want, without you having to write a new email each time,. So this is especially great if your schedule is packed and you're also creating content for your blog consistently. And it will get it into the hands of your readers and people who are excited about it, and that is what we want. Also, make it easier on yourself. Don't be afraid to keep your emails short and sweet as long as it's still valuable.

[00:22:40.830] - Allea
It's getting eyeballs on your content and it's providing value to your readers, and that is what is important. I don't want you to keep sending emails just because you haven't sent one in two weeks. Just go ahead and send the email, get those eyeballs out there and share valuable content with the people who've told you that they want it from you. Okay, we've reached the end. Those are all five steps.

[00:23:01.330] - Allea
If you have questions, if anything is lingering, go ahead and drop them in the chat here. You can always come back to it. Or if or when you join my email list, you're welcome to email me back. Just reply to any of those and it will land in my inbox. Then before you go, I do want to share about how I work with clients.

[00:23:19.240] - Allea
So, if you feel overwhelmed or excited about any of these five strategies, I want to support you. Whether like I said, overwhelmed or excited, you can feel both emotions too. But I work one on one with bloggers and content creators and just like them, I want to bring your email marketing to life. If your email marketing is not getting the results that you want or that you know are possible, we should talk. There are so many ways to strategize and position your content or product offers and share them with your subscribers.

[00:23:49.930] - Allea
So, for context, I work one on one with bloggers who have existing content that they're eager to share. They're excited about their message and how they can help their readers. They want to see a positive change in the lives of their readers. That's why they're sharing this valuable content. Some of them have a product or course, others just want to send more traffic to their list.

[00:24:08.700] - Allea
But we can promote things, whether it's content paid or unpaid, just as easily. So, my clients trust me to help them create a strategic sequence that builds relationships and brand loyalty with new subscribers and convert them towards higher traffic and sales. So, I love assisting my clients through this process, and I can help you do it too. So, when you and I work together, we would create a foundation for your email marketing. Whether that's a welcome sequence, an ongoing nurture sequence, or more than one, or a sales funnel with a webinar, any of those can be the foundation for how we get started.

[00:24:44.830] - Allea
And then from there, it's just onward growth. And of course, I also make sure that you feel set up and prepare to email your list consistently as you go back and set up your habits within your team or your own schedule. So, if you were curious about what's possible for your business and how I can help you get there, I would love it if you would book a discovery call with me. So, duett.co/call. There's no charge to hop on a call with me.

[00:25:11.020] - Allea
It's a short 20 minutes call. I will let you know if we're not a good fit to work together, but I would love it if you would like a call with me. We can chat more. I'd love to know what your struggles are and what opportunities are in front of you that you are like, Allea, need some help getting there. I'd love to be able to help you do that.

**Transcript:**
[00:00:13.430] - Allea
Hello. Welcome to this advanced email marketing presentation titled Three Ways to Boost Conversions by Mastering Tags and Segmentation in Your Email Service provider. First, I'd like to introduce myself. I'm Allea Grummert and email marketing strategist and conversion copywriter. I help online businesses make a killer first impression through welcome and nurture sequences that engage readers, build brand loyalty and optimize conversions for sales and site traffic. My background is in advertising with a start in online marketing. When I created my personal finance blog called Ask Allea in May 2016.

[00:00:50.550] - Allea
As I continued to learn the ropes of running a blog and creating content, it became really clear how email marketing is a sustainable and profitable way to connect with readers long term. I work with service providers and content creators, including money bloggers, financial advisors, product and course creators, and membership communities to create tailored strategic welcome initial email sequences that promote products and content readers both love and engage with. You are here today. If you want to better understand the role of tags and segmentation in your email marketing so that you can boost click through rates, pitch high converting targeted offers, and can keep subscribers happy, and opening your emails for years to come.

[00:01:34.320] - Allea
If this seems like an advanced topic, no worries. I have an act for making complicated things simple. So, it's really doable for you to take and apply what we cover today to your own email marketing. Takeaways you can expect to learn today, how conversion copywriting uses what we know about your audience to position your offer strategically and move your subscribers to act, the value of personalizing your email automation based on segments of your audience versus sending general content to your whole email list, and how this important strategy impacts your overall list of, how you can optimize your welcome sequence and follow up automations to send specific targeted offers to your subscribers. So, they're more likely to resonate with the content you share and click through or buy.

[00:02:19.110] - Allea
Plus, you'll learn simple ways to incorporate tags to help you understand your subscribers both what they're interested in and what they're not. So, you can provide an intentional personalized experience while they are on your email list, and strategies to increase click through rates, boost conversions, and reduce unsubscribes. So, you have a happy list of engaged email subscribers who are more likely to buy from you if not now, in the future. Before we dive into strategies, I feel like it's important for me to lay out clear definitions for some of the most common terminology.

[00:02:52.780] - Allea
You'll hear it throughout this presentation. Starting with one that may be new to you, but it's actually the basis for the work that I do with my clients, conversion copywriting. Conversion copywriting is a method of persuasion based on knowledge and understanding of your audience. It's crafted into an intentional strategy, and it encourages your audience to act all through helping your reader better understand or identify their needs and then connecting that with how you offer a solution. And through that is when we ask your audience to engage in what they need to do next in order to take advantage of that solution.

[00:03:29.790] - Allea
This is different than sending the same message to all subscribers and expecting the same impact for each reader. Instead, conversion copywriting and email marketing strategies understand the value of personalization to increase conversion rates and boost long term brand loyalty. That's why tags and segmentations are so important. That's what we're going to cover today. Now, let's talk about your offer. An offer is something that delivers value to your audience and to your business. Whether the goal is for you to build credibility, boost revenue, or increase page views. It could really be any number of things.

[00:04:05.370] - Allea
You might not be selling a paid offer, but we are always, quote, unquote selling an action or response. So, offers may be a product, affiliate partner products services, webinar trainings, free content like blog posts, podcast, PDF resources or videos, or really anything that could help make your readers life easier, more enjoyable, or lead to a positive change in their life. If it requires your reader to take action, we can consider that an offer no matter how small an ask it might feel like at the time, that will more likely lead to a higher converting offer down the road. Because you've nurtured your reader and kept them engaged with relevant content.

[00:04:49.050] - Allea
Next up, let's get clear on your automated sequences. These are the two automated sequences where you will use today's strategies most often. The welcome sequence provides new subscribers with a proper, immediate welcome, so they can connect with the heart of your brand and understand what to expect while being on your email list. In long term, nurture sequence maximizes popular or high performing blog posts, or sending relevant content to segments of your subscribers, including paid offers to your list on autopilot. In many cases, a long term nurture sequence also includes sales emails.

[00:05:22.870] - Allea
Now for the nitty gritty subscriber details, inside of your email service platform, you have the ability to organize your subscribers through two very significant ways. A tag is a marker of important engagement by a subscriber used in a variety of ways to better connect with them based on their interest or activities. A segment is a collection of subscribers, which can be organized by a variety of settings, most commonly through the use of tags. I always explain it like this. Tags are like ingredients, and segments are like recipes. Much like a recipe contains ingredients.

[00:05:58.370] - Allea
Segments contain tags. So, like a recipe, a segment is entirely dependent on what it's made of, it's tags. A segment can be made up of a dozen Tags, or only two, segments are pretty flexible like that. So, if you want to personalize an experience for a group of your subscribers, which would be a segment of your email list. You can use tags to identify which subscribers should be included in that particular segment, as well as those who need to be excluded. Okay, let's spend a little more time talking about the value and purpose of tags, and why are tags so important?

[00:06:33.340] - Allea
Well, like I mentioned, tags allow you to monitor and track the activity of each of your subscribers, so you can personalize their email experience based on their unique engagement. You can use tags to know what your subscribers are interested in, what they've clicked on or what they've purchased, including their optin source, which is the form on your site. Right. So that way you know how people join your list. Webinar Activity, whether your subscribers have registered, attended, or missed a webinar. Preferences, whether they prefer more of one type of your content versus another. Interest, you could track what people click on, whether it's a topic or theme and purchase activity.

[00:07:14.860] - Allea
So, this would be whether somebody had clicked through to a sales page and purchased, or maybe they haven't yet. Really tags are essentially limitless. By using tags, we're better able to target your readers based on their needs, wants, and desires. When set up correctly, tags allow you to create a user experience that's as unique as each person on your email list. And that's important because every person on your list is different. Yes, they are subscribers, but they're also people. Personalization matters for higher conversions as well.

[00:07:48.700] - Allea
According to research from the Lyris Annual Email Optimizer Report, 39% of marketers who segmented their email list had higher open rates, 28% had lower unsubscribe rates, 24% had better deliverability, and 24% saw increased sales. Happy Subscribers open your emails, take action on your offers and more favorably, view your brand even after your welcome and nurture sequences end. So, when are tags helpful? Tags allow your email animations and nurture content to achieve everything they're supposed to on your behalf on autopilot. So, tags are helpful when they're used to track specific engagement, send relevant content only to the subscribers that it matters to the most, and trigger activity or follow up sequences based on their activity with your previous emails.

[00:08:41.310] - Allea
Tags are not helpful when the data you're tracking isn't really beneficial to the subscribers or your overall strategy. Or when the tags themselves are named poorly, and you can't actually remember what their purpose is for. For instance, if you tag subscribers with the term YouTube, can you really recall what that means? That your subscribers say that they want to know about new video updates? Or did they just click on a YouTube link one time? One piece of advice is to be aware of over tagging.

[00:09:09.910] - Allea
Tagging email subscribers can become like any other feature of marketing. If taken to the extreme, it can be a waste of time because you may be tracking things you don't need. However, if you do not use tags at all, you're really not leveraging this powerful feature of your email service platform. Alright, we're ready to dive in and talk strategy. There are dozens of ways you can use tags to segment your list and engage your subscribers more effectively. But today we're only going to talk about three.

[00:09:38.360] - Allea
I promised you three ways to help you boost conversions, including an increase in click through rates, a way to pitch high converting targeted offers and strategies to help keep subscribers happy and opening your emails for years to come. So, let's start with the first one. Ask your subscribers to self segment in your welcome sequence. Your welcome sequence is a fantastic time to ask your subscribers what they prefer to learn more about and what issues they're currently struggling with. Or you can use this as an opportunity to organize subscribers based on skill level.

[00:10:08.990] - Allea
It really all depends on the kind of business or blog you run. To do this, use link triggers as a way to categorize your subscribers. Have your subscribers self segment by asking them to click on the option or more than one option that best suits them like their topical interests, which could be multiple. Or skill level regarding a topic or stage of life, and in this case, you really want to encourage them to only click one of the options. The biggest struggle, or hang up with your blog's topic, like maybe it's investing, or maybe it's understanding retirement. Or have them click on the next big goal in their life or their business.

[00:10:45.750] - Allea
When they click on a link trigger, they'll get a tag. This tag can trigger any number of automations, including one in the next step that I'll share with you. So here's the tip. Schedule a follow up email to send to those who haven't clicked in the self segmentation email, so they don't have that tag yet. Make sure that you follow up with them to maximize the opportunity for them to share their preferences with you before moving through your automation. How does this strategy help boost conversions?

[00:11:12.060] - Allea
Well, this strategy ensures subscribers feel heard and understood. It gathers firsthand data of what your audience wants more of, and it creates segments of your audience and determines who needs to receive which relevant targeted offer or nurture content next. When you ask the subscribers for their preferences and then they feel heard from their response, they will experience greater brand loyalty because they're getting exactly what they asked for. These self-segment tags also allow you to see from high level where your subscribers fall in relation to one another, giving you relevant data to help you tailor your future content or products to meet the needs of your audience.

[00:11:50.970] - Allea
Plus, having these tags allows you to send more targeted offers when you use this next strategy. Using tags to send relevant nurture content to your subscribers. After your subscriber self segment, create and send them an automated follow up sequence based on each of your segments. This could include a nurture sequence based on segment interest or skill level, where you send lots of really valuable content, maybe sending them back to your blog or a sale sequence to promote a specific offer. At this point, you get to share relevant content with your readers and generously.

[00:12:24.470] - Allea
So, because you'll know they love it and because they requested to know more about it. Here's another tip for people who do not click in the self segmentation email. Be sure to consider which of your follow up sequences would be best suitable for the majority of your audience and plan to send them through that sequence by default. Use each nurture or sales sequence as an opportunity to speak directly to the segment of your audience it's written for. This allows you to tailor the language of the emails more personally, directly talking to the specific need or interest that they have.

[00:12:57.090] - Allea
Remember, personalized content always performs better than generalized emails, whether you're selling a paid offer or sending readers back to your blog, the overall sequence of emails in a nurture or sales sequence should be designed to help your readers experience a transformation or improvement in their lives. Like creating their first budget, learning how to use a robo advisor, and all this will help them confidently take action, make a change in their life, or complete a purchase in order to help them get there. How does this strategy help boost conversions?

[00:13:29.590] - Allea
Well, this strategy increases open and click through rates because these email sequences are only being sent to those subscribers who are the best fit to receive the content. It boosts the know like and trust actor with your brand because you're sending them helpful content and solutions to meet their most pressing needs. And it reduces unsubscribes because you're not sending unhelpful on one of content to subscribers it doesn't relate to. All of this means you'll build trust with your subscribers early in their experience with your brand, making them happy readers who will be opening your emails for years to come.

[00:14:02.670] - Allea
Well, there used to be a time when you would send an email blast to your subscribers, we don't do that anymore, or we shouldn't, especially not when your goal is to connect with your email subscribers in order to boost conversions. Email has become more sophisticated, so now you can allow subscribers to set their own preferences using tags. With this strategy, you can use tags to ask subscribers what they want to receive or what they don't. Gather your subscribers preferences using link triggers and tags in order to limit which emails they'll receive, so they only get what they want.

[00:14:36.910] - Allea
This strategy puts the power in your subscribers hands to determine what lands in their inbox and when, including their ability to SEO their preferred sending frequency or even mute seasonal promotions. Use the information you gain from these tags to modify your ongoing automations in your live podcast or newsletters. Let's explore both of these examples. First, how to allow subscribers to set their sending frequency. To do this, create tags that associate with each sending frequency option you want to provide, so they're easy to identify and exclude from live broadcasts or newsletters like this, prefer weekly only, prefer monthly only. And then add the link triggers to request your subscribers preferences to any of these places.

[00:15:22.770] - Allea
Your automated welcome sequence and early email of your ongoing nurture sequence, as well as a broadcast or newsletter sent to your existing subscribers. Incorporate these options into an automated email like your welcome or nurture sequence, to ask your subscribers what they prefer early into their experience of being on your list. If you're setting this up for the first time, be sure to send these out as a broadcast to your list to gather preferences of your existing subscribers, too. Now, none of this matters if you don't know how to put it in action.

[00:15:50.820] - Allea
So, once you have this set up, exclude these tag subscribers from your new emails unless it's the email you've chosen to send them for that week or within the month only to subscribers with that tag. Then add a link to the footer of your live broadcast emails to allow subscribers to simply click to adjust their preferences. For the second example, we'll cover how to allow subscribers to mute seasonal promotions, just like with the spending frequency strategy. We want subscribers to stay happy on your list even if they don't want to buy what you're selling right now.

[00:16:22.870] - Allea
We want subscribers to mute themselves, well, you and your emails without completely unsubscribing. To do this, we simply need to give them the choice. For example, say you're running a special over the weekend of Black Friday. Add a link trigger option to your email throughout your promotion. That simply says, would you like to be excluded from these promotions? If so, I'll keep them from hitting your inbox. Click here and I'll update your preferences. Here's an example of what that tag could be on the back end of your email service platform. Would just say mute and then the name of the event or promotion and then the year.

[00:16:57.990] - Allea
Then add the link triggers to all of your limited time campaign emails. And once that's set up, make sure to exclude that tag from all promotional campaign emails sent to your whole list. So, as you send out emails related to your deals for that weekend, you'll exclude this tag from newsletters. You'll be able to rest assured knowing that you're keeping some of your subscribers very happy by staying out of their inbox for the time being. However, of course, you can return to normal after the promotion is over.

[00:17:26.150] - Allea
At that point, you can delete the mute tag to keep your email service platform clean and tidy. How does this strategy help boost conversions? It reduces unsubscribes, right. Because you're not sending unhelpful unwanted content to subscribers that it doesn't relate to or who don't want what you're selling, but they want to stay connected. And it builds brand trust because you're asking for and listening to their specific and unique preferences unlike many brands. People love having control over what lands in their inbox and by giving them an option to adjust their preferences versus unsubscribing entirely promotes goodwill and autonomy.

[00:18:04.240] - Allea
So, subscribers will choose to stay on your list longer and by keeping them happy and subscribe. They're more likely to engage with future offers or promotions to wrap up. Let's review what we covered today. While there are dozens of ways your email marketing strategy could play out, I hope you can use these subscriber, tag and segmentation strategies to help boost conversions throughout your welcome nurture and sales sequences. So, now you know how conversion copywriting uses what we learn about your audience to position your offer strategically and move your subscribers to act. The value of personalizing.

[00:18:38.190] - Allea
Your email automation is based on segments of your audience versus setting general content to your whole list and how this impacts your overall list health, how you can optimize your welcome sequence and follow up automation to send specific targeted offers to your subscribers. So, they're more likely to resonate with the content and click through or buy. You also learned simple ways to incorporate Tags to help you understand what your subscribers are interested in or what they're not. So, you can be really intentional with the personalized experience that they have while being on your email list.

[00:19:10.650] - Allea
And lastly, strategies to increase click through rates, boost conversions, and reduce unsubscribes. So, you have a happy list of engaged email subscribers who are more likely to buy from you, if not now, in the future.

[00:19:22.410] - Speaker 2

I do it inside of ConvertKit, but the same can be done in a lot of different other platforms as well, so I encourage you to go through to duett.co/BBS2022.

[00:00:03.200] - Liz Stapleton, Host
All right, guys, I'm so excited to have my friend, Allea, back. She is an email marketing strategist and conversion copywriter who helps bloggers make a lasting first impression through automated welcome and nurture sequences. She helps her clients create strategic email sequences that engage email subscribers, build brand loyalty, and optimize conversions for sales and site traffic. She is Allea Grummert from duett.co. And welcome back, Allea. I'm so excited to see you again. 

[00:00:34.850] - Allea Grummert
I'm so excited to talk about this too. I love all things email, so happy to have this conversation and hopefully it'll help your attendees.

[00:00:42.850] - Liz
Yes, and we're going to be talking about -- I know we're both a little ConvertKit obsessed. So, this is -- this chat is going to be more ConvertKit focused. But we're going to be talking about tracking where leads are coming from and how it impacts your list growth. So why don't you kind of tell us how those things tie together a little bit and then how they kind of play off each other.

[00:01:06.130] - Allea
Yeah. I think when you get started with blogging, you're just like I need to get -- I need to get an opt-in form. I just need to get a landing page. I just need to put them on my list. And with time, you get to try out a bunch of different type of offers, freebies, and so it's important to know how those are actually performing. So I just worked with a client on like an opt-in audit and optimization type project so actually looking at the numbers and seeing how people are actually joining the list based on whether it's through Grow, like the Grow plugin, or if it's a resources page on their website or sharing on social media and actually looking at the conversion rate of those forms. But if you don't look at your data, you don't actually know it's working, and for a while, I think like having just a few that you're just like I'm over here building like my blog. I just need my opt-ins to be working. That's great. But there's also a season for going and seeing how you can optimize those things. And then once you know it works, then you put those in those prominent positions and places on your website or on social media.

[00:02:08.070] - Allea
Yeah, and that will drive your list engagement even more.

[00:02:12.640] - Liz
Yeah, because if you see that a form is converting really well but it's not getting a lot of page views and one that is getting a lot of page views isn't converting swap those out.

[00:02:22.860] - Allea
Swap them.

[00:02:23.730] - Liz
Yeah.

[00:02:26.610] - Allea
Yeah.

[00:02:26.950] - Liz
Yeah. Okay. And I'm actually -- so I know I used to be better about this. I'm actually guilty of not really tracking how well those landing pages going. I'm great at tracking like my broadcast and sequences and stuff, but I'm like yeah -- I'm working on it. I'm actually working on building out a dashboard.

[00:02:41.800] - Allea
Yeah.

[00:02:42.810] - Liz
But how -- what would you consider to be like a conversion rate where you're like, you know, we're going to let this ride or this needs some serious tweaks? And where do you start? Like how do you kind of start evaluating that?

[00:02:56.620] - Allea
Great question, Liz. It really depends on the type of form. So, like if you have a form in your footer, that conversion rate is going to look abysmal. I think it's going to be like point one percent or something because it's showing up on every form whether -- or showing up on every page of your site whether they're scrolling all the way to the footer, or not.

[00:03:17.020] - Liz
Yeah.

[00:03:17.340] - Allea
That's going to have a different conversion rate than say like a landing page. So, part of it is relative. But yeah, one of the things actually -- I have so many ways we could go with this -- but yeah, well try out the different forms on your own site and just see if that impacts the actual conversion rate or number of subscribers over a certain amount of time. But like a landing page, if you can get 25 to 30 percent, I think that that's good. I'm sure that there are actual statisticians or how do you say it? Statisticians?

[00:03:50.750] - Liz
[Crosstalk 00:03:51] Statisticians was correct.

[00:03:51.030] - Allea
[Crosstalk 00:03:51] People who follow -- statisticians? Who are like, um, like Litmus is really good, L-i-t-m-u-s. They're like an email marketing expert. Anything HubSpot says. You can also check out like ConvertKit will probably have a report, and any real ESP will have a report on that.

[00:04:07.110] - Allea
But, you know, I have a old business coach that she said her convert -- her landing page was converting at like 50 percent or -- I don't know.

[00:04:14.590] - Liz
[Crosstalk 00:04:14] Yeah, I feel like that's the standard if it's a freebie.

[00:04:16.980] - Allea
[Crosstalk 00:04:17] Like it's a freebie.

[00:04:17.930] - Liz
Yeah.

[00:04:18.640] - Allea
Yeah. And it, it might be just a matter of getting in front of the right people. One of the things too is like to not judge the conversion rate too soon like if you're not getting a lot of page views, you know.

[00:04:30.540] - Liz
[Crosstalk 00:04:30] Need more data.

[00:04:31.600] - Allea
[Crosstalk 00:04:31] You need more data to work with in that case. So, and that's where you can create like a similar landing page or different landing pages for different offers and just see like, is it, you know, but if it's all kind of like the same style, then you can actually test the offer. Or if it's the same offer, the same freebie on different styles of forms, that's kind of how you can compare and see which, which type of form and which freebie are actually benefiting you the most. And then like you can experiment like off of your website too. Like so on your website, there's like your footer, your sidebar. Having it in Grow. Changing out your Grow call to action. How you're positioning that freebie in just a few words will really challenge you in a really good way, I think. You can have a banner across the top of your website. If you have, you know -- the About page is usually one of your highest -- most traffic pages, so make sure there's some opt-in there. I always recommend some resources page, not necessarily a library, but a page with your resources. I'm not saying you have to have like 15. If anything, like kind of pick one from each type of maybe segment of your list or segment of your content.

[00:05:41.850] - Allea
And then off your website too, like sharing on social media and sharing in stories, doing a list swap with somebody else's email list, things like that is definitely a way to get more traffic to those forms.

[00:05:52.610] - Liz
All right. I'm going to share my screen so we can give some real-world examples because I feel like that's always helpful. All right. Can you see my screen?

[00:06:05.930] - Allea
Yes, I can.

[00:06:07.050] - Liz
So this is a resource page for one of my sites. I think it kind of aligns with what you are talking about. It's not a library, but there's different, you know, I've got my free webinar here. I've got my checklist. I've got some articles that I think are helpful or just the direct link to FTC disclosure information, right, for ebook, things like that. This is like a paid ebook, but it's, it's directing them to my resources.

[00:06:31.450] - Allea
Absolutely. But you can go to mine too if you want duett.co/resources.

[00:06:36.560] - Liz
[crosstalk 00:06:37] Oh, yes. [inaudible 00:06:37] 

[00:06:36.560] - Allea
So I've got my freebies here. There's actually a paid product listed up in here too, up in this part. And then as you keep scrolling, you'll actually see I go into like recommended tools and talks,

[00:06:55.730] - Liz
Yeah.

[00:06:55.890] - Allea
and podcasts, and books and stuff too. But my opt-ins are up there towards the top. And then at the bottom of every page on my site, nope not that page, is -- it would be like an opt-in if you go to my home page or whatever, you'll see a freebie at the bottom of the home page.

[00:07:12.830] - Liz
Yeah, so I've got, and I'm going to show -- so

[00:07:15.770] - Allea
[inaudible 00:07:15] Every...

[00:07:15.420] - Liz
those of you familiar with like Lizzy Goddard and her Everything Page, that's kind of what this is. But then I also have, let me hide my face, like a resources page that's a little more. So there's kind -- there's different approaches you can take to it, right. These are all like specifically products of mine. Some are free. Some -- most are paid. Not scrolling very fast, I realized

[00:07:41.990] - Liz
but

[00:07:42.590] - Allea
[Crosstalk 00:07:42] Yeah, and just like...

[00:07:43.040] - Liz
similar idea. There's a lot of different approaches you can take to it.

[00:07:46.780] - Allea
Yeah. Let's see. I have a client that I did that opt-in audit with. You know, 

[00:07:52.480] - Allea
she had really specific things to like baking and whatever.

[00:07:56.320] - Liz
Uh-hmm.

[00:07:57.040] - Allea
Like you might even have seasonal freebies that you want to try out. But if you're not tracking how they're actually performing, then you don't know whether to mess with it the next year when the holidays come around or something like that, or this particular event, or this type of traffic coming to your site versus trying out a new opt-in like message or freebie because the freebie could be the same. It could just be the message or the style of the pop-up could impact things as well.

[00:08:22.690] - Liz
Correct, agreed. And I -- you have to figure out where you're going to just pull that data from, right.

[00:08:28.810] - Allea
[Inaudible 00:08:28]

[00:08:28.950] - Liz
So I would go to ConvertKit which is [inaudible 00:08:30] ConvertKit. This is actually not very reflective of the actual stats because I use ConvertBox, and so a lot of it's just a pass-through type of thing.

[00:08:42.080] - Allea
[Crosstalk 00:08:42] Uh-hmm.

[00:08:42.520] - Liz
Whereas at one point I may have had it embedded, but now it's a pass through, you know, it's why you have this where it's like a 5,900, you know. It's because it's never actually seen that form, but somehow it's gotten 59 subscribers because I use another tool.

[00:08:54.990] - Allea
[Crosstalk 00:08:56] Yes.

[00:08:56.090] - Liz
So just, yeah, you can see a lot of these images.

[00:08:59.280] - Allea
Yeah.

[00:08:59.609] - Liz
Yeah.

[00:08:59.960] - Allea
And the sweet team member is like I don't get it. How can I have 1,200, I'm like,

[00:09:03.980] - Liz
[Crosstalk 00:09:04] Yeah, [inaudible 00:09:04]. 

[00:09:04.780] - Allea
subscribers to have [inaudible 00:09:06] with like one view. And so, yeah, just making sure that you grab that data from the source itself. I know that Grow doesn't have that kind of data.

[00:09:17.070] - Liz
[Inaudible 00:09:17].

[00:09:17.070] - Allea
And so what you could do with Grow is just look at the number of subscribers you got and then divide that like by page views

[00:09:25.650] - Liz
Yeah.

[00:09:25.860] - Allea
to your blog pages. You know, if you kind of narrow that down in Google Analytics,

[00:09:29.620] - Liz
Yeah.

[00:09:29.920] - Allea
that's one way to do it. And that way you can hopefully see that number change over time.

[00:09:34.460] - Liz
Yeah. I just wanted to point out because we were going to talk about this is I've been like pleasantly surprised I get at least one subscriber a day from Creator Network

[00:09:45.110] - Allea
Yes.

[00:09:45.590] - Liz
which has been awesome. Like this is -- I feel like it's more than that. I don't know if this is like a date range or something.

[00:09:53.760] - Allea
Uh-hmm.

[00:09:54.160] - Liz
I don't know. But I just like it's such a -- like I didn't do a whole lot, and it's just bringing in people.

[00:10:01.360] - Allea
Yeah.

[00:10:02.070] - Liz
So -- but you are definitely more of an expert in terms of the Creator Network than I am. You're like the -- you're like the face of the Creator Network when all the ads came out.

[00:10:12.420] - Allea
I was. That was

[00:10:13.750] - Allea
really funny.

[00:10:14.690] - Liz
That was yeah. I was like you're ConvertKit famous.

[00:10:17.550] - Allea
I got so many text messages. I was like that is my face, you're right.

[00:10:21.460] - Liz
Yes, so why don't you maybe kind of tell us a little bit about -- see, I recommend you.

[00:10:26.240] - Allea
Oh.

[00:10:26.490] - Liz
[Crosstalk 00:10:26] I don't really send a lot of your way. I'm not, I don't have my settings very good. But...

[00:10:32.890] - Allea
Yeah, let's talk about it. Like...

[00:10:34.400] - Liz
[Crosstalk 00:10:34] Yeah, let's, let's talk about this as a strategy because this is very easy to track. It tells you where you're getting stuff from.

[00:10:42.270] - Allea
Oh, my goodness. Yes. And it's just a really great way to cross-sell related content between different bloggers and creators and maybe people you haven't even met yet which is what the Discover tag is for. But [inaudible 00:10:55] -- Liz, if you want to open up even just your profile,

[00:10:58.850] - Liz
[Crosstalk 00:10:59] Oh, okay.

[00:10:59.430] - Allea
sorry taking you for a loop, but on the bottom right where it says Preview so this is your creator profile, and so you can share this link all right at all times. So you can have links there. You can link back to blog posts so people can click through look at the blog post. Yeah, if you want to click on it, Liz, you'll see your name and the opt-in form.

[00:11:20.590] - Liz
[Crosstalk 00:11:20] I will click on the post. This is...

[00:11:23.180] - Allea
[Crosstalk 00:11:23] Is it a blog post? And that's...

[00:11:24.710] - Liz
No, these are email broadcasts I've sent.

[00:11:27.240] - Allea
That's what I meant. Yeah, so if you click on that. So when you send out emails through ConvertKit, you can turn it on to make it public and it'll show up here. But notice the subscribe button is on the left. So like this is a whole resource in itself. So, if people refer you out, you can see this. What I recommend is just making sure that like what you deliver and who you serve is so dang clear. Right where it says, ""Hi! I'm Liz and I help blogger save time, stress less, and earn more,"" like that is what people are going to see when you're being recommended to their audience, right, and so it just has -- and it is really clear, Liz. So instead of it just being like, you know, food blog or something or whatever, how do you make sure it's really clearly speaking to the right people so when they see that for a blip of a second they're like, oh, yeah, I do want that. And then when you make your recommendations --

[00:12:17.170] - Liz
[Crosstalk 00:12:17] [Inaudible 00:12:19]

[00:12:17.170] - Allea
-- yeah, mine says email marketing for bloggers.

[00:12:19.680] - Liz
Nicely done.

[00:12:20.270] - Allea
[Crosstalk 00:12:20] profile. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. So and I've got a lot of words there because I'm a wordy person --

[00:12:25.170] - Liz
Uh-hmm.

[00:12:25.310] - Allea
-- and I don't really have a name for my newsletter.

[00:12:28.870] - Allea
It's just -- it's about email marketing for bloggers. So yeah, those are some of my public blog posts. I hate GIFs, as you can tell. I can't believe now that I love GIFs. They're all over.

[00:12:41.810] - Liz
[Crosstalk 00:12:41] I hate too, but I call them Gifs.

[00:12:43.500] - Allea
All right, you know what? We're all going to go to the grave saying something different. So -- but if you want to -- yeah, there's one of my products and then my recommendation.

[00:12:52.660] - Liz
[Crosstalk 00:12:52] And these are -- this is a product that's like hosted through ConvertKit, correct?

[00:12:56.310] - Allea
Yup.

[00:12:56.540] - Liz
Yes.

[00:12:57.170] - Liz
Okay.

[00:12:57.970] - Allea
And then links as well to follow me on Instagram, a couple of my freebies, so I'm treating this as though people seeing this have never met me before.

[00:13:07.630] - Liz
Yeah, [crosstalk 00:13:07] Madison.

[00:13:10.160] - Allea
Yeah.

[00:13:11.340] - Liz
Another speaker this year, I believe. I'm pretty sure she's here. Yeah.

[00:13:15.200] - Allea
So, if you go under your ConvertKit backend again --

[00:13:19.900] - Liz
Uh-hmm.

[00:13:20.670] - Allea
-- and you look under my recommendations, this is where you -- okay, good. The page you're on is perfect.

[00:13:27.360] - Liz
Yeah, no, I just wanted to show how you got there.

[00:13:29.080] - Allea
Oh, yeah, recommendations this is where we are. So the tabs here where you have recommended by, my recommendations, [inaudible 00:13:34] cover. Under my recommendations, you can add as many creators as you want. And then under your settings, you can choose how many actually show up in the modal. So, I guess we should -- we should have said, if you're not familiar with the ConvertKit network, it's basically when people are opting in for your email list, like one of your freebies, you can recommend three to five other people like with a little pop-up, it'll come up that create kit -- Convertkit manages. And then all they have to do is in one click, they're signing up for Nina's list or signing up for my list. So then you get to choose as the creator what this modal is even connected to. So, if you click on Edit there, Liz, you can actually see all of the different forms where the modal is being used where the creator network is actually being used. So, if you're like, oh, I'm not -- I'm not referring it to very many people, chances are --

[00:14:26.830] - Liz
[Crosstalk 00:14:27] You don't have it showing a lot.

[00:14:28.460] - Allea
-- you don't have it showing a lot where on the other side where you're like these people are recommending me, but I'm not getting any view -- but they're not getting views and I'm not getting any leads, chances are they don't have their form set up.

[00:14:38.390] - Liz
Okay.

[00:14:39.510] - Allea
And the other cool thing about ConvertKit is the paid recommendations as well. This is a newer feature as of 2023.

[00:14:49.360] - Liz
That -- this -- so this part down here where it says pay this is if you want to pay for recommendations.

[00:14:54.010] - Allea
No.

[00:14:54.120] - Liz
[Crosstalk 00:14:54] [Inaudible 00:14:56]. No?

[00:14:55.090] - Allea
No.

[00:14:55.450] - Liz
[Crosstalk 00:14:55] It's a good bit.

[00:14:57.220] - Allea
Yes, you can -- you can get paid to recommend others.

[00:15:00.520] - Liz
That I know.

[00:15:02.440] - Allea
Yeah.

[00:15:02.750] - Liz
What is this? What is this?

[00:15:04.640] - Allea
Oh, yeah, it's saying add it to more forms. But with SparkLoop, it's a free account you sign up for. We get access.

[00:15:09.450] - Liz
[Crosstalk 00:15:09] I do you have SparkLoop. Yeah.

[00:15:11.890] - Allea
Yeah, so it's, it's not -- you're not a creator partner. You're a creator. I forget what the other tab is at the top of their website. But basically then you can say -- you can have like paid recommendations as part of your recommendations. So, you have unpaid and people who are willing to pay you a $1.50 to $3 for qualified leads going to their list.

[00:15:29.880] - Liz
Yeah, I feel like this is the easier way to go about it right here, which by the way, I have no idea how ConvertKit comes up with these numbers. They're really random. 

[00:15:37.360] - Allea
Isn't that not true from your products?

[00:15:39.120] - Liz
Well, no. Well, so I think it pulls in like -- yeah, no, it like these are totally made up numbers. I don't know where it gets from.

[00:15:47.610] - Allea
[Crosstalk 00:15:47] Oh, that's so interesting. That's always been accurate for me, but...

[00:15:50.270] - Liz
I know. Well, because I do have Thrivecast and I have Shopify, but I like don't know where it gets these numbers from.

[00:15:56.450] - Allea
If you click on go to -- go to purchases -- is your screen blinking, by the way?

[00:16:01.830] - Liz
No.

[00:16:02.140] - Allea
Blinking on my end, but...

[00:16:03.120] - Liz
Yeah, see, I don't have any products on this ConvertKit account.

[00:16:05.930] - Allea
Oh, my gosh, that is absolutely bonkers. How funny.

[00:16:09.310] - Allea
No, I'm...

[00:16:09.860] - Liz
Why? See, yeah. I'm like I don't -- these are made up numbers.

[00:16:14.780] - Allea
[Crosstalk 00:16:15] That's frustrating. So...

[00:16:17.270] - Liz
[Crosstalk 00:16:17] That's okay. This is not where I go to figure out my revenue.

[00:16:21.310] - Allea
That's just the Convertkit. But yeah, when you set up paid recommendations, you can choose out of like the number of people that you are actually recommending on your modal. Like for me, I pick three. I feel like it's a nice number. It's not too many.

[00:16:34.100] - Liz
What [inaudible 00:16:35]?

[00:16:34.100] - Allea
And yeah, you might put the log in there. That's a lot of buttons there. You can choose like how many of my three recommendations is a paid recommendation, and it'll just kind of cycle through them for you. So I, I think I have yet to make any money off of SparkLoop recommendations. I think you want to be under partner programs --

[00:17:02.500] - Liz
Okay.

[00:17:03.390] - Allea
-- maybe or referral programs.

[00:17:07.000] - Liz
These are my referral programs.

[00:17:08.860] - Allea
Okay. So it's probably... [crosstalk 00:17:09] 

[00:17:10.250] - Liz
Paid, free -- see this is where I get confused.

[00:17:15.470] - Allea
This is a great question, Liz.

[00:17:17.340] - Liz
[Crosstalk 00:17:17] newsletter revenue. What's that? Let's look at that. Add a new post.

[00:17:23.230] - Allea
Oh, this is you get to add yourself as a publication which I think you actually need to do in order to actually be able to refer anyone else.

[00:17:29.880] - Allea
Let me open up

[00:17:31.250] - Allea
my SparkLoop here.

[00:17:32.510] - Liz
All right, let me stop sharing my screen.

[00:17:34.260] - Allea
Oh, you're fine.

[00:17:35.900] - Liz
No, I'm just going to

[00:17:39.160] - Liz
screen share.

[00:17:40.840] - Liz
Stop screen share. All right.

[00:17:43.900] - Allea
Oh, baby, baby.

[00:17:45.050] - Liz
[Crosstalk 00:17:46] We're smart people. We can figure this out.

[00:17:48.390] - Allea
We, oh, boy, are we. Okay. We're going to look at -- can you see my screen?

[00:17:53.980] - Liz
I sure can.

[00:17:55.630] - Allea
Okay. So I have it under -- oh, Creator Network is like right here. See? This looks different than what you have.

[00:18:02.000] - Liz
It is.

[00:18:02.520] - Liz
So like -- so the SparkLoop -- so before Creator Network, SparkLoop integrated with like ConvertKit as like a referral program to help grow your newsletter, right?

[00:18:12.650] - Allea
Uh-hmm.

[00:18:12.940] - Liz
[Crosstalk 00:18:12] Before Creator Network was [inaudible 00:18:13].

[00:18:14.950] - Allea
[Crosstalk 00:18:15] Uh-hmm.

[00:18:15.470] - Liz
And but it was only on my Creator Pro Plan or whatever. And so I got on that, and so that's when I started my SparkLoop account.

[00:18:23.480] - Allea
Right.

[00:18:23.850] - Liz
I don't know.

[00:18:26.060] - Allea
So I wonder when you create your -- when you go through that process...

[00:18:28.500] - Liz
[Crosstalk 00:18:28] But yours also says grow your newsletter not set up. So I wonder if I set up my thing, it will then -- if it will then show.

[00:18:34.940] - Allea
[Crosstalk 00:18:35] Oh, that switched.

[00:18:35.820] - Liz
Yeah.

[00:18:36.740] - Allea
It switched to partner?

[00:18:38.020] - Liz
How did you do that?

[00:18:39.800] - Allea
I just clicked --

[00:18:40.670] - Liz
[Crosstalk 00:18:40] Grow your newsletter switched to partner. Guys, you're getting like some real time.

[00:18:46.410] - Allea
So if I go under my profile, I do have my own profile. Okay.

[00:18:51.150] - Liz
[Crosstalk 00:18:51] Publication. Okay.

[00:18:51.280] - Allea
My own publication -- I'm just not actually paying anyone.

[00:18:55.110] - Liz
[Crosstalk 00:18:55] Yeah.

[00:18:55.330] - Allea
I think like there's like a certain minimum --

[00:18:58.020] - Liz
Yeah.

[00:18:58.420] - Allea
-- not in my budget.

[00:19:00.050] - Allea
But you can see --

[00:19:02.110] - Liz
Not in your strategy.

[00:19:03.600] - Allea
Not in my strategy. I have not made room for it.

[00:19:06.310] - Liz
If you wanted to budget for it, we both know you could.

[00:19:08.880] - Allea
Probably could. So these are people that I...

[00:19:10.970] - Allea
[Crosstalk 00:19:11] Oh, I love talking shrimp.

[00:19:12.740] - Allea
Yeah. These are people that I'm recommending. Some are just have pause. Some the budget is used up. And if I actually go under -- one second --hopefully it's my account. If it's, okay, it is. These purchases are accurate. So I don't know what happened with yours. If I go in the recommendations, you'll see I've received almost 600 subscribers.

[00:19:39.020] - Liz
Yeah.

[00:19:39.340] - Allea
Nutso. So you can, actually, you can promote this through forms like opt-ins on your website.

[00:19:48.420] - Liz
[Crosstalk 00:19:48] Yeah.

[00:19:48.420] - Allea
Or you can just promote them or be promoted by somebody just in their email. So thanks, Robbie. That's great.

[00:19:54.790] - Liz
Yeah. How do you do it in email?

[00:19:58.620] - Allea
Shall we find out?

[00:19:59.800] - Liz
Yes.

[00:20:01.080] - Allea
Let's do it. Okay. That's funny. Let's duett.

[00:20:05.110] - Liz
Ha.

[00:20:05.990] - Allea
Okay, so if I come in here, I'm pretty sure it's one of these.

[00:20:10.820] - Liz
[Crosstalk 00:20:10] Is a new thing here. Oh, recommendation. Duh.

[00:20:13.840] - Allea
[Crosstalk 00:20:13] I'm going to select a recommendation Food Blogger Pro. That's awesome. So how cool is that?

[00:20:22.960] - Liz
Oh, It's giving me ideas. You guys might be so this is obviously airing while the summit is live, but you might see some of this in action and some of the emails I'll be sending out.

[00:20:31.400] - Allea
There you go. So, you can do it within email. And then if I go on to recommendations, you'll see I have a bunch of --

[00:20:40.820] - Liz
[Crosstalk 00:20:41] Yeah.

[00:20:41.560] - Allea
-- [inaudible 00:20:41] events here.

[00:20:41.880] - Liz
I haven't spent a ton of time in it. I need to dig a little deeper, but it's -- I've, I've been impressed with it so far.

[00:20:49.100] - Allea
Yeah. So, the settings is where you can enable by default if you want. I have it a part of 14 forms, and then under customize is where you can change the language. You can choose the number of slots. I have it, so that I have a paid recommendation showing up first --

[00:21:02.740] - Liz
Uh-hmm.

[00:21:03.080] - Allea
-- you know, and you get a notification if certain budgets are used up. So sometimes I just want to go back to regular recommendations. Or you could have all three be paid recommendations and really try your hand at it. That's a whole strategy too.

[00:21:15.170] - Liz
[Crosstalk 00:21:15] Yes.

[00:21:15.440] - Allea
And it'll show you down here how much you've earned. You'll notice I have earned nothing. But they each -- they each have kind of their own -- in SparkLoop, you'll see what the expectations are for payout. It's not just a lead. Like maybe it's somebody who's been on their list and has clicked at least once in two weeks or something like that.

[00:21:34.580] - Liz
Yeah.

[00:21:35.070] - Allea
So that's all under here.

[00:21:38.480] - Liz
Okay.

[00:21:38.640] - Allea
[Crosstalk 00:21:38] I don't know how to click, but you can click and search. You'll see, yeah, they've definitely added a lot more since the first time they set it up.

[00:21:47.650] - Liz
Yeah.

[00:21:48.340] - Allea
Like I'm not a founder. This is not a good fit for my audience.

[00:21:51.726] - Liz
Uh-hmm.

[00:21:52.230] - Allea
People coming to me are bloggers. They're not looking to find -- like found the startup or whatever. So yeah, you can come in here and just search like blog.

[00:22:02.410] - Liz
And looks like they have filters, so.

[00:22:04.580] - Allea
Yep, a few anyway.

[00:22:06.540] - Liz
Yeah.

[00:22:07.750] - Allea
There you go, and it's constantly changing and improving as well.

[00:22:11.630] - Liz
Yeah, I mean, we're recording this at the end of 2023. This is airing January 2024. It may not look the same as it does now. So just kind of...

[00:22:21.240] - Allea
[Crosstalk 00:22:21] Surprise, it may change.

[00:22:24.050] - Liz
[Crosstalk 00:22:25] So.

[00:22:25.870] - Allea
So, yeah, Creator Network. And then, you know, the, the cool thing about what ConvertKit has been talking about, and Nathan Barry himself a lot over the last year or so, it's about this idea of a flywheel. So the more subscribers you get, the more you can actually charge for sponsored sections of your newsletter. They are rolling out, and they have a partnership with a website called Liveintent to actually run display ads in your emails.

[00:22:53.900] - Liz
like dynamic? -- nice[Crosstalk 00:22:54].

[00:22:54.810] - Allea
Like dynamic ads, and you can kind of say like, yeah -- I don't know how they gathered the data because who knows anymore and that's outside of my pay grade with like third party integration and all that third party data. So, but yeah, being able to know like what your audience would actually be interested in and those are the ads that are going to run. You can kind of say yes and no to certain types of ads. So, but you -- we the smaller creators could then take the money from sponsorships put it towards these paid -- be a newsletter that is paying other people to shop in front of their audience.

[00:23:28.740] - Liz
Yes.

[00:23:29.120] - Allea
You know then that will grow your list that can grow how much you actually charge for ad space and how much you actually make from dynamic ads because you have more people on your list. And then you can just continue to reinvest that money into what they call a flywheel.

[00:23:41.740] - Liz
Okay.

[00:23:42.560] - Allea
[Crosstalk 00:23:42] They did not invent a flywheel. Flywheels are like, instead of doing a water pump like where you have to pump manually all the time, the idea is on the flywheel is it takes a lot to get it started --

[00:23:51.650] - Liz
Uh-hmm.

[00:23:51.910] - Allea
-- but once it's up and running it should get easier and more effective with each turn.

[00:23:56.730] - Liz
Okay. So, I like it. No, I like it. She knows what she's talking about. She's She's totally the inside track on what ConvertKit's doing.

[00:24:03.300] - Allea
I'm, I'm nosy [inaudible 00:24:05].

[00:24:05.860] - Liz
Well, like you know all the ConvertKit people.

[00:24:08.170] - Allea
I, I do know them. Yes, and I see them a few times a year at conferences. I'm in their Slack channel. So if anybody has questions, I do have an inside scoop there.

[00:24:16.650] - Liz
Got you. I like it. Okay. So I want to -- the kind of last thing I want to talk about because we talked about tracking it --

[00:24:25.990] - Allea
[Inaudible 00:24:26]

[00:24:25.990] - Liz
-- but basically you almost want to create a database of your data which is real meta.

[00:24:32.840] - Allea
[Crosstalk 00:24:33] Yeah.

[00:24:33.540] - Liz
And, and that is I'd say the one -- like I love, love ConvertKit, but I wish it had a few more organizational tools.

[00:24:40.880] - Allea
I think it's coming. Not that I know anything, but I might know something.

[00:24:46.670] - Liz
You're like I may have heard something.

[00:24:48.000] - Allea
I may have heard something somewhere.

[00:24:49.530] - Liz
Somewhere? Okay.

[00:24:50.180] - Allea
[Crosstalk 00:24:50] A better dashboard is coming.

[00:24:52.640] - Liz
[Crosstalk 00:24:53] Okay. Interesting. Interesting.

[00:24:53.640] - Allea
Yes.

[00:24:53.890] - Liz
So I don't have -- so I don't made up numbers.

[00:24:56.120] - Allea
Oh, no. [Inaudible 00:24:56].

[00:24:57.520] - Liz
[Crosstalk 00:24:57] Well I think part of that -- no actually, you know another thing because it's like total and it's like nothing this month cause I think, sorry, used to have Podia connected.

[00:25:04.640] - Allea
[Crosstalk 00:25:05] Oh.

[00:25:05.270] - Liz
So that's like the revenue from years ago in Podia or something that it pulled through?

[00:25:10.930] - Allea
[Crosstalk 00:25:11] Maybe. I don't know.

[00:25:12.763] - Liz
[Crosstalk 00:25:12] I don't know.

[00:25:13.320] - Allea
Like I want to know where I can find that $16,000, please.

[00:25:15.790] - Liz
Right.

[00:25:17.780] - Allea
You're telling me [inaudible 00:25:18].

[00:25:19.000] - Liz
[Crosstalk 00:25:19] ""Your week with Convertkit"" emails and I was like, well, this is a completely made up number.

[00:25:24.440] - Allea
Yeah. So, yeah, you mentioned like having a database. But then also what's really good about this too is if you're thinking funnels --

[00:25:33.300] - Liz
Uh-hmm.

[00:25:33.540] - Allea
-- you want to be able to track your registration page opt-ins. So I have a client right now, they're running funnels with even deadline funnel with like scarcity involved and price discounts and what not. But they have multiple different forms that could lead to the registration -- like could actually lead to someone being registered. One is through affiliates. One is through their website. One is through another like conference or sponsor involvement.

[00:25:59.300] - Liz
Uh-hmm.

[00:25:59.570] - Allea
And so able to track like how are those forms performing and then even like the [inaudible 00:26:04]  sequences that are attached to that then how are those performing week to week, month to month. Because as much as we're like funnels should always be growing it's like some seasons they just don't.

[00:26:16.200] - Liz
Yeah.

[00:26:16.470] - Allea
Like some seasons are just lower, but you don't want to just assume that things are failing. A lot of it is seasonality too.

[00:26:22.390] - Liz
[Inaudible 00:26:22].

[00:26:23.250] - Allea
So, yeah, by knowing do these forms convert well, whose coming in, then you can actually like make sure you're spending enough time or money if you're running ads too. This client is also running ads -- making sure that those are actually effective. And if you track your subscribers in ConvertKit or whatever tool based on whatever opt-in they came in from, you have really good data. You can pull together a segment, if you will, who came in through the paid registration app or ad, and registration page, who's also purchased you can actually get a real number for that.

[00:26:55.340] - Liz
Okay.

[00:26:55.760] - Allea
Right. So if you give them or you could even set up a segment that's like if came in from this form and they also have the purchase tag, how many is that? And then you can do the same thing for the affiliates or whatever and make sure that each of those campaigns is actually being really effective.

[00:27:11.570] - Liz
I like that. I like that.

[00:27:12.600] - Allea
[Crosstalk 00:27:12] And then you basically take that number divide it by the number of registration, like the number of people who've registered to get an actual like conversion rate because if you're like it's 120, great. What does that mean? It's like, okay, 120 divided by the number of registrants --

[00:27:25.560] - Liz
Yes.

[00:27:25.860] - Allea
-- would be your conversion rate from paid ads all the way down to [inaudible 00:27:30].

[00:27:31.020] - Liz
Use a calculator. Okay. Definitely use a calculator because you can Google like conversion calculator. I mean, I love math, so I'll just pull out my little calculator. But, you know, I know that I'm unusual in that sense.

[00:27:45.240] - Allea
Well, this is the -- this is the --

[00:27:46.670] - Liz
[Crosstalk 00:27:46] It's not hard math.

[00:27:48.130] - Allea
No. And even like having a Google spreadsheet where you track this info over time because this is where like you can actually track the data too. And you're like, okay, if I have this many subscribers, and it earns me this much money then you kind of know how much you want to put more into ads.

[00:28:04.290] - Liz
Yeah.

[00:28:04.760] - Allea
And actually, like because, you know, if you -- same with the flywheel, you put that money into the ads --

[00:28:09.490] - Liz
Uh-hmm.

[00:28:09.620] - Allea
-- it should generate the same kind of conversions across the board through registration page, through emails, through purchasing, through whatever, and then you just keep making more money.

[00:28:19.570] - Liz
Yes. And I will say I've gotten good over the last -- this year of like tracking my broadcast and stuff. And I'll, I'll share my screen real quick because I think you'll be proud of me.

[00:28:30.570] - Allea
Yes.

[00:28:33.860] - Liz
So this is like my -- it's in ClickUp. And so I have it just an automatic filter to forward it to this list, and then I have to go in and add the like data, but it doesn't take long. But then that way I can just go through, like especially on weeks when you're short on time, I can be like, well, what's done well? Or if I want to run a sale on this -- what's led to more revenue? And, you know...

[00:29:00.450] - Allea
Yeah.

[00:29:00.880] - Liz
So.

[00:29:01.270] - Allea
Yeah. So, you just -- you go in and you just pick one that's made you money?

[00:29:04.700] - Liz
Yeah, like I can just reuse it then. I'm not trying to dig, you know. Cause sometimes you're just you're short on time. You know I run Freebie February every year. It's coming up next month, guys. And I can see all the examples of what's done well in the past and what's had good open rates or click rates or whatever, so.

[00:29:24.930] - Allea
I -- you see my face right now? I can barely comprehend how -- this is so cool. Yeah.

[00:29:35.590] - Liz
Yeah. And it's not all completely filled in, right? Because it took a long time to get this like set up.

[00:29:40.270] - Allea
Set up.

[00:29:40.750] - Liz
But I got to the point where now I just have to like go in. And so it's like a recurring task that I need to go in -- I need to and sometimes I get two things because the way [inaudible 00:29:47]. So, I delete the duplicate and then --

[00:29:50.870] - Liz
[Crosstalk 00:29:51] Yeah.

[00:29:51.090] - Liz
-- once a week I go in and I basically fill in, okay, well, how many people got this? What was the overall click rate? And what was the point of the email? Like what was...

[00:29:59.020] - Allea
Uh-hmm.

[00:29:59.330] - Liz
Right. I've seen a lot of Summit stuff.

[00:30:02.540] - Allea
Well, you and I run very different businesses too. Like I'm a service business. I have a couple of small products. I have a couple affiliates, but I don't even really promote them regularly.

[00:30:11.930] - Liz
Yeah.

[00:30:12.120] - Allea
I need to take a dose of my own medicine there --

[00:30:14.790] - Liz
Yeah.

[00:30:15.020] - Allea
-- so that I am like, you know, so what do -- how can this apply to the regular blogger who maybe has one product or an ebook and freebies? But, you know, maybe like they don't have an email that just generates income.

[00:30:31.430] - Liz
Yeah.

[00:30:32.830] - Liz
Right. And not all these are income based, right. But I can go through and I say, okay, best of --

[00:30:36.940] - Allea
[Crosstalk 00:30:37] Uh-hmm.

[00:30:37.370] - Liz
What's [inaudible 00:30:37]? I don't know what this is, but. 

[00:30:40.340] - Allea
The first thing that comes to mind for me because I work with a lot of food bloggers, actually, so for them, it's a matter of seasonality. So, you know, it's coming up on Easter. What email did you send out for Easter last year? Can you split it into two? Do you want to resend it a second time? Like be able to play with that data?

[00:30:59.540] - Liz
[Crosstalk 00:30:59] Like what the past Black Friday --

[00:31:00.380] - Allea
[Crosstalk 00:31:00] Like Black Friday. 

[00:31:05.160] - Liz
-- ones did?

[00:31:05.380] - Allea
Yeah.

[00:31:05.500] - Liz
This is stuff I just pulled in and definitely doesn't have like an accurate, uh, some information.

[00:31:10.170] - Allea
Yeah.

[00:31:12.210] - Liz
But, yeah.

[00:31:12.470] - Allea
Yeah, so looking back at what has already happened and then being able to  repurpose that I think there's a lot of hang up. And I've heard this from all of my clients and people on my list that they're like, oh, I didn't know you could reuse content. And it's like, yep, you absolutely can.  Like as long as you [inaudible 00:31:27]. 

[00:31:27.330] - Liz
[Crosstalk 00:31:27] And for years I was constantly building from scratch. I'm like but I've done this before. I should just be able to find it. And so setting up the system to be able to find it --

[00:31:38.080] - Allea
[Crosstalk 00:31:38] Yes.

[00:31:38.490] - Liz
-- was my tricky part. That was my hold up. But I finally, finally did it.

[00:31:41.140] - Allea
Yeah, and then like you just continue to tweak it over time. So the subject line did really well. You know, maybe you do an A/B test of a different subject line the next year and just see how it performs. See if it does any better, you know, continue to try and improve --

[00:31:57.110] - Liz
Yeah.

[00:31:57.310] - Allea
-- from there.  

[00:31:58.650] - Liz
Okay. And that actually leads us perfectly to a little something, something you have for people. Why don't you tell us about it?

[00:32:04.950] - Allea
Yes. So I have a goals and growth tracker spreadsheet already ready for you that you can copy and use and be able to track your different opt-ins. I have it set up to track it on a monthly basis, but then you can also track your sequences and just see from a high level over time. I would -- I mean, you don't have to take a ton of time and write out all the updates to every sequence all the time. But, yeah, you will be able to track your broadcast or or like a campaign in general. So, for instance, like your Blogger Breakthrough Summit promo is its own campaign.

[00:32:36.770] - Liz
Yeah.

[00:32:37.310] - Allea
Same could be like Thanksgiving campaign and you're tracking those four emails so you can just see how they did over time. Maybe even if it helps track the actual number of click throughs so you're like this is how much potential revenue came through on display ads or something like that. Yeah, I have that for you guys and that you can just copy and save to your own Google Sheets and populate that with your data.

[00:32:59.660] - Liz
Yes, and the link to that is below. Allea, thank you so much for coming back. I always love having you because Allea and I go way back. So I always like anytime to hang out I would text her. I was like, we're still on today, right?

[00:33:13.120] - Allea
We are. We are. Yeah, since 2016, Liz was one of my, seriously, one of the two first blogging friends I ever met, so.

[00:33:21.070] - Liz
And then you said the other one decided to actually go live by you. And I, I didn't make that choice, sadly.

[00:33:25.820] - Allea
Yeah, I got the other friend to come live in my same city.

[00:33:29.400] - Liz
But, yeah. So again, guys, if you need help figuring out kind of the strategy of email marketing like she's your girl. She, she just knows her stuff so well. I think you even host like a office hours type of thing that people [inaudible 00:33:42].

[00:33:42.770] - Allea
[Crosstalk 00:33:42] Yeah, I host a monthly roundtable. So it's free to attend. Every month is a different topic to just really help troubleshoot things with email. The idea being that if you have any questions that are keeping you from sending emails, I want to answer them so that you can go share your message with more people.

[00:33:58.380] - Liz
Yes. Yeah. So she, she's great for the strategy and helping you figure that out. And the reason my ConvertKit account is not nearly as much of a mess as it used to be is because of her. So, Allea, again, thank you so much, and hopefully everyone got a lot out of this. I know I did.

[00:34:14.130] - Allea
Yeah, absolutely. Thanks for having me.

**Transcript:**
[00:00:09.940] - Anna Crosby
Welcome to How to Write Great Emails (Even if You're Not a Writer). I am so glad that you're here because email marketing is a great skill to learn for your business, since email marketing is not going anywhere. You might as well learn how to make the most of it and make it work for your business. Before we get into it, let me just briefly introduce myself. My name is Anna Crosby, and I run Geni Collective, which is an email marketing consulting company. I love email marketing, obviously, since I'm giving a presentation on email marketing, and I also love the technology that comes and is available with email marketing and automation. I have been in business since 2013 and exclusively online since 2015, so it did not take me very long to realize that having an online business fit my life and my personality better than having an in-person business. Fun fact, my very first business was selling handmade jewelry. I am also a social media avoider. I avoid using social media. I don't use it in my personal life or for my business. I've built my business entirely relying on email marketing. I do this every day and this is the way that I communicate with my audience, and I should say the only way that I communicate with my audience, outside of obviously doing these talks and other collaborations and outreach.

[00:01:43.200] - Anna
I am also a very introverted person. I love having time to myself and recharge. I mention this because email marketing for me is uniquely suited to introverted traits. If you are also an introvert and you struggle with knowing what to say or struggle with showing up, then I'm going to have some tips in here for you, as well. Lastly, I am also a max level nerd because I have a PhD in Cognitive Psychology and Neuroscience. I've spent the better part of a decade learning everything that I can about the brain and how it works. Combining this with learning about marketing later on in life just seemed like the perfect pairing for me to go into business. So that's it about me. Let's talk about you. You are here, probably, I'm assuming, because you want to write good emails. And more importantly than that, you want to write emails that make you sales, that make you money, right? But more than that, you want to feel proud of your emails. You want to look at an email that you wrote and say, ""Oh, gosh, that's a great email."" You want to feel proud of the emails that you put out there.

[00:02:59.260] - Anna
And maybe you've also sent emails before just because everybody says you should be doing email marketing, you should be sending emails. So you've probably sent emails just to send an email with no strategy or higher purpose than that email whatsoever. If that's you, absolutely no judgment because we've all been there. And you're also probably here because you're not a copywriter or you don't consider yourself any, really, kind of writer. That's very common for the clients that I work with. They come to me and they say, ""Well, I just don't know what to write. I'm not a writer. I've never written anything. I'm not interested in writing a novel in email form."" So if that's you, you are in the right place. And optionally, you are a bit on the introverted side and you just generally find it hard to show up, especially with emails. It's optional. You don't absolutely don't have to be an introvert to get the most out of this talk. But if you are, then it is a bonus. Here's what we're going to cover, really simple. I'm going to tell you about seven things that you should consider when you're writing your emails, to take your emails from like, ""Ah, at least I sent an email"", to ""Wow, that email I wrote was really great.""

[00:04:24.170] - Anna
All right, so we are going to go ahead and dive straight into the first one. And I want to get this out of the way because I know as business owners, we want everything to be perfect. We want everything to be professional and polished and all of those things. And that's the first thing we're going to have to let go of when you are doing email marketing. Email marketing is a marathon, not a sprint. Each individual email will build on your strategy. But each email, if you have a tech mishap or a typo or something like that, it's not going to break it. Again, a lot of my clients worry about these things, right? And maybe you are worried about them too. You're worried about making typos or spelling errors. You're worried that your emails are too long or too rambly, or tech mishaps like forgetting to put the variable that inserted somebody's name in the email. It just has ""Hello, first name,"" and it doesn't actually put it in there. Stuff like that. This is what everybody is worried about. If you were worried about these, don't worry, it's completely normal.

[00:05:32.280] - Anna
But you know what? Your subscribers don't care about these things. That's the good news about it. What do subscribers care about? They care about connecting with real people. They care about communicating informally. Email is an informal way of communication. It's not like you're writing a book. You're writing emails. We write emails to friends. Well, maybe less so nowadays. Nowadays, we just write them text messages and instant messages. But email is an informal method of communication. People are also interested in being friends with people on the internet. If somebody is following you, you want to make them feel like you are a friend to them. You're not somebody who is an unreachable celebrity, and email really facilitates that. I want to say that don't let this perfectionism or wanting to make your emails super polished, super professional. Don't let it stop you from reaching your people right now, because your people need you and they need to hear what you have to say. So let's just get it out of the way, let go of all of the perfectionism, and let's reach the people right now.

[00:06:47.120] - Anna
The second tip that I have for you is to know the purpose of every single email that you send. There are some emails that are focused more on education. There are some emails that are focused more on getting engagement. There are some that are focused on sending you to a sales page so you can make a purchase. The purpose of each email is unique. You might say, ""Well, duh."" When you are sending one-off emails like your weekly newsletter or your regular campaigns, you might think, well, that makes total sense. But it also makes total sense when you are looking at emails in a series such as a welcome sequence or a sales sequence. The way that I teach how to write welcome sequences, which I'll tell you more about at the end of the presentation about how you can get that for free, in the way that I teach, I teach to write six emails, and each one of those six emails has a specific purpose.

[00:07:47.030] - Anna
Like I said, some emails are focused on getting engagement. Some emails are focused on building connections. Some emails are focused on going to a page to decide to make a purchase. The same is true of a sales sequence as well. Not every single email is focused on... Well, obviously, the call to action is always to go to the page to make a purchase, but the purpose of each email is different. For example, you might have a sales email that talks about why they want to get the item that you're selling. You also can have emails that share testimonial or other success stories that make the customer or potential customer, imagine what it's like to own that product. When you know what the purpose is of every single email that you are writing, it makes it that much easier to write this email. Not to mention that when you know what the purpose is, it makes every single email that you send, whether it's standalone or in a sequence, have a strategic purpose to them.

[00:08:56.850] - Anna
Tip number three, you want to share your story and let your subscribers get to know you. Of course, email marketing is still marketing, so you need to talk about your products, you need to talk about your services and the successes that your clients are getting, all of those things that we normally think about when email marketing, but you also need to talk about yourself beyond what you can do for them. This is the reason why I shared a little bit about myself in the introduction. I let you know my background and where I was coming from so that you can put everything that I'm telling you about email marketing into practice. For example, I don't use any social media. I built my business only using email marketing. That tells you that when I talk about email marketing, I talk about it in that standalone way where it's not dependent on another system like a social media profile in order to work. So you know that about me. And if you join my email newsletter, you'll hear talk about all other kinds of personal things that have absolutely nothing to do with email marketing. I do that so that I can share more about where I'm coming from in my experience so that we can make a connection together. Because here's the thing. People can buy what you are selling, the same thing that you're selling almost anywhere on the internet. The internet is a huge place, and there's lots of people doing the same thing that you are. However, you want to distinguish yourself. Why would people want to buy that thing specifically from you?

[00:10:33.970] - Anna
That is because people buy things from people that they like. In order to infuse some of that likability factor, you need to also talk about yourself and your story and your experience in the emails that matters a lot. All right, next thing. Then I'm going to talk about promotion and promoting with integrity. What does that actually mean to be authentic in your promotion? You hear that word a lot. Everybody talks about being authentic. It is the most important thing to be authentic when you are actually promoting something, especially if it's an affiliate product or a software that you want to make an affiliate commission on. My biggest advice is to always promote the tools and resources that you have actually used, or tried to use, or test it out yourself. That is the biggest thing for when it comes to promoting something with authenticity. I know that nowadays, bundles are the big, huge thing, and everybody is running a bundle and everybody is contributing to bundles. I think it is just a fantastic way. It's a win-win for everybody involved. This issue of authentic promotion comes up probably more than you would think because not all bundles are created equal. Not all bundles have the value that you would expect, and sometimes that leads to a sticky situation when you are trying to promote.

[00:12:09.140] - Anna
My best advice on how to get around these issues is to really focus on what you know is good value and be honest about what is not. That doesn't mean that you have to say, ""Well, this bundle is not very good value, but you should check it out anyway."" Focus on what you know is a good value. You know your products are in there. Instead of talking about all the hundreds of resources and the worth is such, and such, and such, focus on promoting your product in the bundle because you know that even if they don't get anything else from the bundle, they're still getting a great deal by getting your products. That is one way to deal with that, while staying in integrity, sometimes it may mean that you have to back out or not participate in a promotion if you see that you cannot promote it in authenticity. But one thing that I will say is that your audience will learn about your values and how you do business based on how you handle situations like these.So focus on what you know is great value. If it's something that is actually going to be helpful to your audience, focus on that.

[00:13:28.810] - Anna
The next tip is to give them choice. And by them, I mean your email subscribers. And that is, and I know this is a little bit of a controversial and emotionally-charged topic, you want to make it easy for people to opt out of certain emails, and you want to make it easy for them to unsubscribe. And here's why. Email marketing, when it is done right, is a pull marketing, not a push marketing. So the difference between them, a pull marketing is when you are organically attracting people to read the stuff that you write and to see your promotion and to go get your offers. Push marketing is what you see normally on social media with advertisements where advertisements will pop up into your feed, whether you've asked for them or not, usually not. You want your email marketing to be pull marketing. You want people to want to read your emails. You do not want to push your emails onto people. That's why a big aspect of email marketing is getting consent in the first place to join an email list.

[00:14:36.410] - Anna
That's really very important with GDPR and Can-Spam laws. You want to make sure that people are actually opting in to hear about your stuff. That consent, I don't feel like it's a blanket consent for everything. If you are running a promotion and you're emailing them every day for a week and a half, you might want to give them the option to opt out of hearing about that specific promotion or even one of your regular content. So if you have a blog post and a video and a podcast and you are sending separate emails promoting each one of those, maybe you can let people opt out of, for example, if people don't listen to podcasts or if people are not interested in watching your videos, if they just want to read the blog post, make them, or give them, rather, the option of telling you what they want to hear about the most. Here's the thing. When I say this, inevitably somebody is thinking, Well, if they don't want to hear about it, they can just delete the email and move on. Maybe that's what you're thinking about right now too. Why should I go the extra mile to create all the system for people opting out and telling me their preferences if they can just delete the emails that they're not interested in?

[00:15:59.470] - Anna
Well, here's the thing. You don't want to train your subscribers to delete your emails, which is essentially what you are doing when you are giving them everything and anything under the sun that you have and they're only interested in a small part of it. They'll, for example, if you're running a promotion and they're not interested in the promotion, they're going to be deleting your emails that whole week that your promotion is going on. You don't want them to delete your emails. Not only is it bad for your deliverability long term, but it's also letting them know that when they see your name in their inbox, ""Oh, this is about the membership that I don't care about,"" and they'll just delete the email after the promotion is over, they might still have that gut reaction to delete your emails because they think it is promotion related. So don't train people to delete your emails. The other thing too is to make unsubscribing easy. A lot of people feel weird about unsubscribing because they think that you'll know that they unsubscribe and they don't want to hurt your feelings or just goes to their promotions folder and they're not interested in reading it, so they just leave it there and it goes there to die a slow death.

[00:17:13.670] - Anna
Whatever the case is, make unsubscribing easy because the people who are not interested in getting your emails after a certain point will never become your customers. Why should you be paying for them in your email marketing software? Why should you be spending all this effort and sending them the emails? Why should you have your open rates suffer and your click rates suffer just because somebody's just not interested in it and they just feel bad for unsubscribing? Make it super easy. Tell them in the first email that you send to them, ""Hey, you're going to be hearing about such, and such, and such. If you're not interested in this, click here to unsubscribe or scroll to the bottom and unsubscribe. No hard feelings, no questions asked."" I feel like you would think, well, people would know that, but saying it explicitly makes it easier for them to do it if that's what they want to do. Again, don't train your subscribers to delete your emails. Instead, give them the choice and respect their inbox.

[00:18:14.800] - Anna
All right, next, we're going to talk about relevancy. For those people who don't want to unsubscribe or opt out, they want to get your emails and they want to hear from you, there's one thing that you need to think about for those people, and that is personalization, making sure that the emails are relevant to them. It's not just me saying this. A 2021 survey done by McKinsey and company found that 71% of customers expect personalization, and 76% of customers are frustrated when they don't get this personalization. And just in case you're wondering, this goes way beyond just putting their first name in the email, that is a form of personalization, but more than that, it's sending emails that are relevant to what that person is interested in. And you can know what they are interested in by the previous products that they purchased from you, where they signed up, what incentive did they sign up for? All of those things are clues about what they are interested in and what their next steps are. Customers actually expect to be engaged and onboarded when they first make a purchase. That was a specific question that they asked on this survey, and the vast majority of customers said that they do expect this engagement and onboarding.

[00:19:42.960] - Anna
What's the takeaway here? You want to regularly ask for your subscribers' preferences, and solicit feedback, and then write to them based on what they said they were interested in. This is really easy to do with your freebie when you're structuring your welcome sequence, which I'll tell you about at the end of the presentation. But you can talk directly to what they are interested in because you know what they're interested in. They just got this freebie on this topic. It's especially relevant if you have multiple freebies and multiple ways that people can come into your email list, those onboarding sequences make the biggest difference. So do not skip on those engagement and onboarding sequences when somebody first joins your list.

[00:20:29.920] - Anna
Here we are, we are focusing on value next. This is the next tip: What is in it for them? This is not to say anything bad about anybody. We are all humans and our brains work in exactly the same way. When we are looking at our email, we are looking for something interesting, something to give us a dopamine hit, something to entertain us. Whenever we are looking at the subject lines inside of our email inbox, we are asking ourselves the question, ""What's in it for me? What am I going to get out of this?"" If it's not immediately apparent what I'm going to get out of this, I'm going to be less likely to click and open that email because I just don't know what to expect.

[00:21:16.360] - Anna
When you are writing not just your subject lines, but your emails in general, you need to answer these questions. Why should your subscribers care about everything that you're saying in this email? How will what you are saying or what you are offering help them? Why should they do what you want them to do? If you want them to click to go to the sales page, why should they do that? You want to really spell it out for them. You want to say, ""Hey, you want to get my welcome sequence because it's the most important email sequence that you ever write and all of your subscribers are going to get it?"" It's really important that you get this right. You need to get my welcome sequence templates, which I will tell you about in a minute. But you want to make sure that you are explicitly telling them the value. Why should they care about this? When you are writing each and every single email, this is what I want you to focus on. Because the word value is generally associated with free content, I want to let you know that selling something is providing value too, because paid products are going to always be better than free products. Your paid products, you've spent a lot of time thinking about the solution and thinking about how to organize it and thinking about making it a complete solution, not just a piece of it that you give away for free, but a complete solution. So when you are selling an offer, you are really providing value to your subscribers.

[00:22:49.270] - Anna
So, here we are at the end of them. Probably should have numbered them in this presentation so I could keep track. But that focus on value, if you don't get anything else out of this presentation, I hope that you at least remember when you are writing each and every single email to make it really explicit why somebody should care about this email. Somebody who's not you, right? Why should somebody on your email list care about what you're writing about? These are all of the tips that we talked about. We let go of our perfectionism. We know the purpose of each and every single email that we write, even when they're in a series. We know that we need to share our stories and our personal experiences to give context to what we're talking about. We always need to promote with integrity whatever the form of that takes, whether it's using the product ourselves and focusing on what we know is good value to pulling out of promotions where we do not feel we can promote them with integrity. We want to give them a choice, a choice to stay on our email list or a choice to get or not get certain types of emails, and we want to make it relevant and ""Why should they care?"" That is, in a nutshell, what the seven tips. If you keep these in mind when you're writing your next email, I think it will really help you to write a better email than just the generic, ""Hey, I made this thing. It costs this much. Click here to get it."" This will make you a better email writer and you do not have to be a copywriter for this. If you notice in my introduction, I did not say I was any copywriter and I am not a copywriter. However, I write good emails, and this is why I share how you can write good emails as well.

[00:24:49.670] - Anna
I promised that I would tell you how you can get my welcome sequence templates for free. Here is how you can get these for free: By joining my Geni Insiders email newsletter community. What a surprise, my community is an email newsletter, right? I'm very, very focused on providing the best value that I can to this community. Other than getting this welcome sequence and a couple of other bonus surprise resources that you'll get when you subscribe. I also host free events, action weeks, and extra support weeks. I host workshops for free for my community, and I don't promote these anywhere else, so if you are interested in learning more about email marketing, I highly suggest that you join my email newsletter. I would love to see you there.

[00:25:41.640] - Anna
And also, if you get the Speaker bonus bundle for the summit, you'll also get my training on how to use email to monetize your blog. Obviously, this is a summit all about blogging. I have made this resource and a playbook that goes with it. It's an interactive workbook that you can work through and really get clear on the steps that you need to do in order to make your blog make you money. This is a training that I normally sell for $79, but it is free if you get the VIP upgrade to the bundle. And of course, you can go to my website at genicollective.com, you can see everything that I offer, including my mini courses, my other templates. I have templates for a lot of different email situations, so you can look through those and see what you need. I also have mini trainings as well as full-blown courses on different aspects of email marketing.

[00:26:36.900] - Anna
Of course, I love email, and I would love to keep in touch with you by email. If you have any questions about anything that I said in this presentation, or if you just want to connect and say hi, feel free to send me an email at anna@genicollective.com. All right, I hope that this has been useful to you, and I look forward to speaking with you soon. Take care.

**Transcript:**
[00:00:10.240] - Caroline Vencil, bloggingonpoint.com
Hi, guys.

[00:00:11.460] - Tracy Lynn, bloggingonpoint.com
Hey!

[00:00:12.040] - Caroline
Hello, hello and welcome to our presentation of Plant Your Flag. I am Caroline Vencil.

[00:00:19.210] - Tracy
And I am Tracy Lynne.

[00:00:20.950] - Caroline
And together we make up the blogging mentorship group Blogging on Point. And we are super, super passionate about helping amazing people who want to make more money from their blogs and from their online businesses. So, we're super excited to share this presentation with you guys today because planting your flag was the thing that for Tracy and I was was really the game changer of of moving our businesses forward and being able to have fun with it, because that's our big thing, is having fun.

[00:00:49.840] - Tracy
Always have fun.

[00:00:51.370] - Caroline
All right. So today you are going to get ready for some homework because that's what we do. We don't believe in just kind of throwing information at you. You need to make it actionable. So, get ready with a notepad and a pen. You're going to absolutely love taking some some little mini homework assignments. And we're going to help you attract your perfect people, repel the rest and create an email list of super fans. So, let's get started. Okay, our goal for this presentation, we want you to be able to find your flag in your niche, plant it and call your people to it; that's our goal here, guys. What is this presentation without us sharing our flag with you guys that you understand, like, what is this flag that you are talking about? So, here's our flag. We're going to be totally honest. We've already explained that we are brutally honest and real with you guys. We are all in this to make money. This is not a hobby. It is a business. And it is okay to say it. Making money from your business is not wrong. It's not immoral. It's not shady. There's nothing wrong with it at all. That's what we believe now.

[00:02:04.990] - Tracy
I want to say something because that's super, super important that you make that mind- mind shift from a blogger to online business owner. And once you do that, it takes the shady out of it, don't you think? It makes it more- it's a big business. This is what I do. There's nothing wrong with making money with my business.

[00:02:25.000] - Caroline
Yes.

[00:02:25.450] - Tracy
So, that's an important point to make as well.

[00:02:27.580] - Caroline
Absolutely. And we hope that you understand that this isn't we're not going to be dealing in snake oil sales here. We're not going to be saying anything that's going to be icky or used car sales-many. These are all things that are going to help you feel connected with your business and with your readers.

[00:02:44.770] - Tracy
Absolutely.

[00:02:47.400] - Caroline
So, let's dive right in with limiting beliefs, because once we say things like we believe that you should be able to make money from your blog, from your business, all of these negative things come up in our minds. I don't know about you, but for both of us, it was a lot of like, ""Oh, no, that can't be right."" ""It's icky."" ""It's gross. ""The only way to make money for my blog is going to be with ads."" ""I would never sell anything. Email is just never worked for me.' ""I have a lot of people on my list, but I guess I suck at selling because nobody ever buys for me.""

[00:03:25.190] - Tracy
Don't you think that is the most common thing, though, is people don't buy. So, if they don't buy the first time, we tell ourselves they're never going to buy.

[00:03:35.280] - Caroline
""I must be doing something wrong."" ""I must suck at what I'm doing because nobody bought from me then and then you never sell again."" Right? Like you've been burned the first time you've ever tried to sell something and then you never do it again. That's not all we want to have happen. Those are all limiting beliefs that we have. I know that you're probably also saying, ""I've already heard it all before."" ""I know emails important, but I guess it's still not working because nobody's buying from me."" Or, ""I have people on my list, but nobody opens it."" Or my ultimate favorite limiting belief that I have said this to myself, ""I can't sell."" ""I can't sell.""

[00:04:14.940] - Tracy
I think we've all said that to ourselves, though.

[00:04:17.540] - Caroline
Right?

[00:04:18.390] - Tracy
Yes.

[00:04:18.510] - Caroline
And it's just a limiting belief, guys. So, yeah, we want to break that out, because the truth is, you're already selling to your list. You're already selling to your people without ever realizing it because what you're selling is you.

[00:04:35.820] - Tracy
I think that right there is a game changer. When I heard that, you know what you're already selling, you're selling yourself, I'm like, ""Oh, my gosh, that's exactly right."" And when you hear those words, it changes everything. It takes from hard to I'm already doing this.

[00:04:53.040] - Caroline
Yeah.

[00:04:53.520] - Tracy
I'm already doing this every single day in my blog post, in my newsletters and my social media post. I'm already doing this.

[00:05:00.360] - Caroline
Yeah, because here's the thing, though. It's not just enough to say, like I'm subscribed to Tracey Lynn, I'm subscribed to Carolyn Vencil. Are you being real with your people? Are you actually showing up as you- not Miss Pinterest perfect. Not the Step third wives version. Not the watered down version where you're afraid to say things like, I don't know. Stinky, stinky face, not the one- not the version of yourself where you're trying to be someone that you're not.

[00:05:37.220] - Tracy
Right. Not following someone else's voice or their stance or their journey, that is a unique thing.

[00:05:44.050] - Caroline
Yeah.

[00:05:44.720] - Tracy
You need to what we like to call ""plant your flag"", find your voice, and don't just find your voice. You need to own it.

[00:05:54.030] - Caroline
Yep. Full, full on. We want you to stop the self-doubt of yourself, you are enough. You are enough. Your people need to and want to hear from you authentically and you need to in your job description. It needs to say, and I show up for my people, I am there for them. I am me to my people. That's what you need to be able to do.

[00:06:24.800] - Tracy
Absolutely.

[00:06:27.650] - Caroline
But wait, why is it so important to find your flag? Why is this so important? Isn't it enough to just write out an email and send it out to people or announce the sale and just send it out to your people? No, it's not enough. We have been there. We've done it. We have messed it up ethically. And you know what? It really doesn't work.

[00:06:51.350] - Tracy
Oh, it's so doesn't work. And that's one of the reasons why we're here today, is to get you unstuck and back on the right track because. Yeah, it's no fun being stuck. We know.

[00:07:03.120] - Caroline
No, absolutely. We have been there. We have struggled through it. And we want to help you out and understanding that honestly, planting your flag, staking your claim is going to be the game changer for you inside of your market and for your business.

[00:07:17.060] - Tracy
Amen.

[00:07:19.440] - Caroline
So, hi again, so that we get to know each other even better. We are Tracy and Caroline, I volunteer as tribute first all the time.

[00:07:27.240] - Tracy
All the time.

[00:07:28.440] - Caroline
Hi, guys. I'm Caroline. I am the owner of Caroline Vencil.com. I am a mom of four. I have three sons and one little baby girl. I am the wife of an amazing, hard working husband. I have been a full time blogger for more than five years now, which is crazy town to me. I full time lover of coffee kitty cuddles and making money while I sleep. I love that. I know. Right. So, here is the back story of this struggle. You seen like I lead with the fact that I'm very successful in my business. I'm very thankful for it, but nobody ever talks about like the origin story. So, I started my blog back in 2015 and I genuinely expected to make twenty thousand dollars. In my first month blogging, I published that Hello World post and crickets. I'm sitting there refreshing the page over and over and over again and I was genuinely shocked that it didn't happen. And then after it didn't happen, I was like, ""Oh, I will just do what all of these other big bloggers are doing, because if it works for them, it must work for me. And that was when I started faking my voice and I lost it. I lost who I was. I got rid of who I genuinely was at my core, which is a total spaz and a weirdo. Can you tell this is really me? If I was trying to be like, ""Good morning everyone. Hello and welcome to our webinar. This is a joyous occasion."" You'd be like, ""Oh, that's weird."" I couldn't do that forever. So, I wound up growing my list with all the wrong people because I did try to do the whole Pinterest-perfect-mom thing for way too long. And in that process of growing my list with all the wrong people, I finally found my voice. I finally found my voice and I got the okay to let my freak flag fly. And then I started to bring in the right people and that's when I planted my flag loudly. I'm allowed human. Just true story.

[00:09:20.760] - Tracy
I love that. Okay, my name is Tracy Lynn and I'm the owner of Simple Living Country Gal.com. Mom of four. GG of two. Adorable little boys, if I do say so myself.

[00:09:31.950] - Caroline
They are.

[00:09:31.950] - Tracy
I'm a full time blogger and I also love Coffee Grandbaby's. I'm kind of addicted to go shows. Yeah, I kind of make money talking about goats, which is fun and in a unique niche to have. So, here's my back story. I started blogging a year after Caroline in 2016 and I got on the chasing pages for the fast income train.

[00:09:58.010] - Caroline
Chu-chu

[00:09:58.380] - Tracy
Oh I know, right. But unfortunately those page views left and that left me standing there trying to find a different way to make money. That's when I turn to email and I got to work attracting my perfect person. Like Caroline, I found my voice because I was copying people in the beginning, too. I think that's something everybody does in the beginning because we need that permission to be our own person. So, I was emulating other people I admired in my niche and I was sounding like them, but I found my voice and that's when I started shouting it from the blogging rooftops. And then something crazy magical happened. My list went from stagnant and nonresponsive to the backbone of my business. My readers started answering questions. They started emailing me. And they started buying from me. And that means I am now in charge of my income and I'm not at the mercy of page views anymore.

[00:10:57.810] - Caroline
And can I get an amen for that?

[00:10:57.810] - Tracy
Okay, so before you plant your flag, you need to know what your flag actually is.

[00:11:09.750] - Caroline
100%. This is our favorite quote, guys. When we heard this quote the first time both of us sat there and were like, ""My mind is blown."" Love me or hate me, there's no money in the middle. And both of us- so, true story- both of us are people pleasers to an extent. We really are. We've had conversations before. We're we're like, ""Oh, what do you think?"" Oh, I don't know. What do you think? Back and forth and back and forth all the time. But at the end of the day, that's not how business needs to be. You need to take a stand, because when you have people who are following you, who understand what you have to say, who are like, ""Yes, that is my girl, she gets me. She's in my head."" I feel like you've known me my whole life. ""How did you know that's exactly what I was thinking?"" And then you're going to have people who are like, ""No, they read the first line of your first email and your first welcome sequence and they are like ""I am out of here."" The truth is, once you find that- once you find the ability to convey how you feel accurately, perfectly, that's what will bring in your perfect person.

[00:12:21.660] - Tracy
I love that you're ""perfect person""- the exact person you want on your email list. Okay, so let's talk about this. We have a process.

[00:12:32.760] - Caroline
We do.

[00:12:33.690] - Tracy
Yes. This is our perfect person process. So, go for it Carolyn.

[00:12:39.600] - Caroline
Okay, so, here is how this is all going to work, because I know that you're probably sitting there like, ""It's fine and dandy, but it's just still not going to work for me."" But we've got you because once you find your voice, once you're able to really hone it in and nail that down and figure out exactly what you stand for, then it will come through in your awesome content. And your perfect person is out there and will be like magnetized to it and will find it and will be like, ""Yes girl! I knew it. I knew there was someone out there who knew what I was thinking. "" They're going to join your email list because you're still speaking to them in a language that they understand and that no one else has spoken to them in that same way. You're going to be talking to them on your email list exactly the way that they need to hear it, touching on the pain points that they're like, ""I didn't think that anybody knew what I was feeling, what I was thinking, my pains I was having."" Then that is how you are going to turn them into your raving fans because you built the content that has drawn them in. They were magnetized to you immediately. In your email, they've become polarized and magnetized to you. Now they're like, ""Yes, yes, yes, yes. 300%, you are in my head. We're besties. I will throw all of my money at you in the best way possible.""

[00:13:52.590] - Caroline
And that's why it's so important that you be your own person and you don't fake it by trying to be someone else. When you're faking it, you're not able to write the exact content that your readers need to read. And you're not able to emulate that voice throughout every single email you send every week. And when you don't be your own person, you're- you're pulling in the wrong people. And when you pull in the wrong people, you have to do a lot of backtracking.

[00:12:21.660] - Tracy
So, our goal today is to help you find your voice right now so you can start bringing in the perfect person right now, so you don't have to go back and fix things from earlier on.

[00:14:29.740] - Caroline
Yeah.

[00:14:31.740] - Tracy
So, let's talk about finding your perfect person. So, if you feel like you were talking to everyone and you don't want to step on people's toes or annoy anyone, then don't skip this. Like Caroline said, we were people pleasers and we've since changed that. The magic happens when you just focus on your story and your message and your niche. Don't worry about how that message is going to be taken by people, because, like we said, love me or hate me, there's no money in the middle. So, you want to plant your flag and decide where you're going to stand. So, the right person people are attracted to you from the beginning?

[00:15:10.620] - Caroline
Yep.

[00:15:12.400] - Tracy
Okay, sorry.

[00:15:15.460] - Caroline
So, your homework is you are going to find your polarizing passion statements. Now I know that that's a big, scary word, right? It doesn't have to be all that this means as you're going to list out three to five things that you feel strongly about in your niche. The goal here is to- it is to get into- is to get your head in the right place to attract your real perfect person to your blog, to your email list, to your Instagram, to your YouTube, to wherever your Internet circle is. You have to figure out three to five things that you feel strongly about in your niche. Now, that doesn't have to be mean. It doesn't have to be nasty. It doesn't have to be anything that is like throwing mud at the other side, unless that's what you really want to do. For me, we're going to list some of our examples. So, I'm in the personal finance space and I feel like everybody in the entire world has an opinion on Dave Ramsey. Right. So, in personal finance, it's just easy to use Dave Ramsey is kind of this lightning rod; either you love him or you hate him. It's either one or the two camps, and there's really not a whole lot of middle ground. So, that's in my world. I would say I blank with Dave Ramsey. I agree with Dave Ramsey. I think he's completely wrong. That would be a polarizing passion statement, because if you're like, ""I love me some Dave Ramsey."" And I said, ""I disagree with everything the man says"", you would be like, ""All right, peace out. That's fine. We're done here."" It's immediately when you read a sentence like that, you know, if I am- if you are my person or you're not my person, without me ever having to say, ""If you don't agree with that, you can just leave."" Do you know what I mean?

[00:17:03.760] - Tracy
No, and I think that's important to say on my niche, it's done just a little bit differently because I blog about urban homesteading, which means how to grow a garden if you live in a city, how to have chickens, if you live in the suburbs. And that means anybody that's a self-sufficient bug out homesteader that lives off grid is not going to be attracted to me. So, my flag is the urban homesteader. And that tells people that aren't into that type of homesteading that this is not the place for them. So, when we say ""plant your flag"", it doesn't have to be- I don't know, it doesn't have to be super direct or yes/no or things like that. It just has to make sure that you're attracting the right people with that flag. You're like, ""Hey, if you live in the suburbs and you don't think you can live self sufficiently, I got you. Come over here. I'm your person. I'm the one that you want to read about.""

[00:17:56.260] - Caroline
Yeah.

[00:17:56.390] - Tracy
So there's different ways to do it. And we just want to encourage you to find the best way to plant your flag, decide what your flag is, and then own it all the way through.

[00:18:05.680] - Caroline
Yeah. And the big thing for it is there's no people pleasing allowed here. You can't say- I'm going to keep using my example because Tracy is going to make fun of me all the time. I know nothing at all about farm animals that I'm not going to embarrass myself; maybe a little bit later. I'll embarrass later. Don't worry,

[00:18:21.640] - Tracy
Okay.

[00:18:21.990] - Caroline
In my world, we're going to keep using Dave Ramsey. It would be the equivalent of me saying, ""I guess everybody could do what Dave Ramsey says or not whatever. It's not a big deal."" Are you going to tell somebody that you are like in love with this person who is a blogger on the Internet and you're like, ""They have no opinion on the most polarizing figure in the personal finance world."" They have no opinion on this? No. You're going to be like, ""Oh, my gosh, this other person absolutely loves this big blogger that I follow."" It has to be something that you're passionate about without diving into people pleasing. So, remember, you're allowed to take a stand because you will bring the right people to you.

[00:19:06.280] - Tracy
That's the ultimate goal. Absolutely. Okay. So, step number two is to make your perfect freebie. This is my favorite thing ever, because now that you know who it is you were talking to that person that has- that is coming to your flag, it's now going to be so much easier to figure out what it is they  need to bring them onto your email list.

[00:19:29.770] - Caroline
Yes.

[00:19:30.100] - Tracy
Because as you start honing in on every aspect of the flag planting process, you are going to make everything easier. So, if you ever struggled with coming up with a freebie, guess what? It's not going to be that scary anymore because you're in the right mindset. You're not faking it. It's exactly who you are and what you believe in. So, now you know the tools that you would need as a brand new person in your niche to get started doing it is- doing whatever it is that you're teaching.

[00:19:59.590] - Caroline
Yep.

[00:20:00.760] - Tracy
Okay, so for your homework, for step number two is you want to make a list of your readers pain points. Now, this is something that Caroline taught me that changed everything for me. Here's the thing, guys, if you know the exact pain points that your readers are having, then you can make a solution so much easier than what you're trying to do now. So, the solution is going to solve a pain point, and that solution is your freebie. And when you offer that freebie, that perfect person is going to read your content and say, Okay, ""This is exactly what I need."" Then they're going to see your freebie. And you're like, ""Oh my gosh, this is exactly what I have to have."" And the process just flows all the way through. Okay, so Caroline, would you like to talk about different pain points in how to do that for our homework?

[00:20:50.900] - Caroline
I absolutely would, because I absolutely love talking about pain points.

[00:20:53.450] - Tracy
You do that's why I'm asking.

[00:20:54.320] - Caroline
This is you- guys, this is like one of the big things that gets so overlooked is once you figure out your ideal person, you can hone in on their pain points, just like Tracey said, so much easier because you know them. So, I encourage you to do a complete brain dump. And what that means is you're literally sitting there pop in some earbuds, turn on like classical music or something, tone out the rest of the world and just fill up a page with all of the things that your ideal perfect person would be saying to themselves, would be struggling with. What are the words that they would use? What are they thinking about themselves? What are the limiting beliefs that they have? What do they want? What are their problems? And then all of this information fill up as much as you can.

[00:21:44.150] - Tracy
And if it makes it- I'm sorry, if it makes it easier, you can use prompts. So, talking. The first person of your reader, I wish, I struggle with, I hate, I need, I want. And just fill in as many answers for each of those prompts as you can do. And let me just say it was hard for me in the beginning when Caroline had me start doing this, but when you start, it's like the dam breaks open and all of these ideas come. So, when I first- when I did this for the first time, I'd like four things on there.

[00:22:14.900] - Caroline
Oh, yeah.

[00:22:15.170] - Tracy
And then after I did it a couple of times, it's like a page and a half.

[00:22:19.340] - Caroline
And the first four, it's like pulling teeth.

[00:22:21.860] - Tracy
Yeah.

[00:22:22.060] - Caroline
You're like, ""I don't know, I guess that they struggle with this, but I don't know what else."" And then once you start digging deeper and you force yourself to sit there for like 10, 15 minutes just writing about your person and what the struggles are, you will find that it becomes so much easier to get all that information out, because once you have that, then you can come back to this list and revisit it so that you can narrow down what kinds of a freebie can you offer to help them with that problem. Now, we're talking like a freebie here, guys. We're not getting into a product yet. We're not even going to go there. So, we're not telling you to make an entire course of like eight hundred different pages. We're talking like a checklist.

[00:23:04.580] - Tracy
Write a checklist.

[00:23:04.580] - Caroline
Yeah, a checklist, a day planner, a guide that they can do.

[00:23:10.400] - Tracy
A worksheet, a cheat sheet . Just one page is all you need to change someone's life forever. Forever. So, don't overthink it. Do your pain points, come up with solutions and just make a one page simple item that will help your readers.

[00:23:27.050] - Caroline
Yep. And then you're going to pick that one pain point that you can do. Just one. We're not trying to solve world hunger here. You're picking one pain point to give them a solution to in your freebie.

[00:23:38.660] - Tracy
Love it. Okay, so what's next?

[00:23:42.440] - Caroline
We're going to craft your perfect email.

[00:23:44.270] - Tracy
Yes. And by this point, guys, since you've already done step one and step two, step three should be a lot easier because you're- you're in that mindset now. You're in the zone.

[00:23:55.130] - Caroline
Yes.

[00:23:55.340] - Tracy
So now that you know your people, you know their pain point, you know their inner voice, you're on the same wavelength with them. You can speak a language that they will actually resonate with. This will build the connection you need to turn that casual reader into your perfect person.

[00:23:42.440] - Caroline
Yeah. And the goal is you literally want to be inside of their heads. And you've already done that work with saying what you feel about your needs and about your topic. You figure it out their pain points, and now you're going to make your perfect emails because it's going to be a lot easier to talk to people once you understand that; you don't have to put on ears to be liked. You already know who it is that you want to bring in. You already know how to talk to them and you know how to speak to them about their problems in a way that is going to click with them.

[00:24:44.090] - Tracy
Absolutely.

[00:24:48.450] - Caroline
We're going to solve your readers problems by being you. Easy peasy, tada. And that sounds a lot more trivialized than it really is, because I understand that you're like ""I don't understand what that means."" What that literally means is you're going to look at one of your readers- I think we have to go to the next slide.

[00:24:44.090] - Tracy
Oh, I'm sorry.

[00:25:08.740] - Caroline
Back, Okay- maybe- no- wait. No, this is fine. So, you need to let them know what you stand for inside of your e-mails by the words that you're using, by the way, that you're talking, by the way, that you are connecting with them and saying, look, ""I know that you struggle with X. I have struggled with X, too, but here's how I've overcome it. Here's the things that I've done."" And you're going to be writing these emails in a way that's just going to be easy. It's not going to have to sound robotic. You don't have to put on ears or sound like, you know, Martha Stewart or look like Martha Stewart, for all I care. You are going to be real with them inside of these emails because, again, you have the full permission to be you.

[00:25:54.130] - Tracy
Yeah. And this is your chance to be conversational. So, you know on our blog post. We're kind of more teacher role. We're kind of more serious in that. Your email, it's game over. You can do and be the exact person and you can give it to them full board. This is still another place where you're planting your flag, because let's look at it this way. When you write your blog post, you're planting a flag. When you're doing your freebie, you're planting just a little bit bigger flag. And when you get them on your email list, then you're put the big flag on there. You're putting it all you right there on the line. This is their last chance to stay or scoot. Good news if they stay, that's your person. Yeah, that is your person.

[00:26:38.200] - Caroline
It's really true. So the goal is you have to let them know every single step of this journey- you have to let them know that they are in the right place. And if you went from being super conversational in a post to being like a college professor with MLA citations in your emails, they're going to be like, ""What happened here?"" ""Who is this person?"" ""I connected with this person in this post. I don't know who is emailing me.""

[00:27:02.590] - Tracy
Right.

[00:27:02.950] - Caroline
And then they'll unsubscribe. We don't want that to happen. You want to continue to be yourself, because the way that you're going to connect with your people is by letting them know that they are in the right place every step of the way.

[00:27:14.770] - Tracy
Okay, with that being said, you don't want to be a jerk.

[00:27:19.870] - Caroline
No, no. You need to give them help. You can't just send them. ""You know what I found out that was really annoying today."" Nobody needs to hear all of that email. You want to still address a problem that they're having inside of the emails because you know, their pain points. You can touch on them every single time, even if it's something as trivial as like ""I did something this week and I thought about you because I encountered a pain point that you probably have that I had to. And here's how I solved it."" And I'm infusing my personality. I'm sharing stories about my life. I'm allowing you to understand, like I'm a real person, like we're building this connection the entire time.

[00:27:58.720] - Tracy
And I think that's super important to touch on.

[00:28:02.110] - Caroline
Oh yeah.

[00:28:02.470] - Tracy
That is their chance to resonate with you.

[00:28:05.440] - Caroline
Yep.

[00:28:05.680] - Tracy
If you share something that happens in your day, then it helps them make that connection. And when you're not faking it, you can share things in your day without thinking, ""All right, how am I going to color this, so, it matches my voice."" You don't have to worry about that. It's just natural conversation in an email that helps your reader resonate with you even more. So, that is huge that you know your thing.

[00:28:26.320] - Caroline
Yes, it's true. However, we do want to point out that when we talk about polarizing things, it's easy. And Tracy, I had to walk Tracy through this, too. When I say polarizing, she automatically thought being a jerk.

[00:28:40.840] - Tracy
Yes.

[00:28:41.490] - Caroline
It's so easy to think like, well, I could just bash everybody. No, no, no, no, no. You can be honest and be fully you with out bashing other people, without slinging mud or without being mean. You can be passionate. You cannot be mean unless that's really what you want to do. But I feel like we've cov-

[00:29:00.700] - Tracy
So, basically what you're saying is and I know I'm asking a question in our own side show, but basically what you're saying is it's okay+ to be positive about the stance that you're taking without throwing anybody else under the bus.

[00:29:12.940] - Caroline
Yeah.

[00:29:13.660] - Tracy
Perfect.

[00:29:14.260] - Caroline
You can say, like, I'm going to keep mu- I mean, I guess- I- let me use- let's use goats, for example, because Caroline knows nothing about goats, but okay. So, you could say, you know, like there's two different camps of you need to have 150 acres if you ever want to have goats or there's people who say, ""I keep them in my postage stamp backyard because it's like- it's like a dog."" If you come in and say, ""I think anybody who doesn't have over 100 acres for their animals is mean and terrible and should be reported to the the authorities."" If you came in and said that, that would be like, whoa, attacking. You don't need to say that. You can take your stance. Be passionate about what you have to say without being mean. So, that's all we want to kind of get to through you guys is not- we're not saying under any circumstances to be a jerk, be passionate, plant your flag and you don't have to throw anybody under the bus in that process.

[00:30:10.380] - Tracy
I love that, okay, maybe some of you still need a little more permission. Guess what? This is your permission to fully be yourself and plant your flag.

[00:30:22.590] - Caroline
Take a picture of the page if you want. We'll even smile for you here. Ready? Screenshot! Please post that on Instagram and tag us, we're @bloggingonpoint on Instagram. I would love to see that all over Instagram. That would just make my day.

[00:30:39.860] - Tracy
That would be awesome.

[00:30:41.110] - Caroline
This is the thing, guys: When we were first starting, we felt like we weren't good enough. We felt like we didn't have enough to say. Like, who were we to have an opinion? How dare we?

[00:30:54.400] - Tracy
Who am I to talk about this?

[00:30:56.280] - Caroline
Yes. And we felt inferior and like we weren't good enough. And it almost- it almost cost us our blogs. I feel like it's pretty safe to say like this, if that had continued, I would have quit because it's so hard to continue to try to be something that you're not.

[00:31:12.220] - Tracy
It's exhausting.

[00:31:12.960] - Caroline
This is your permission to be yourself, to fully be yourself, to show up as you authentically to say what you have to say authentically, to voice your opinion and your authority in your niche. You have authority, by the way, just in case you feel like you don't you have authority, you know what you're talking about, otherwise you wouldn't be there. This is an important part for you guys to understand, is you can fully be yourself and still have a huge following on the Internet.

[00:31:49.990] - Tracy
Absolutely.

[00:31:52.160] - Caroline
They're little healthy dose of of rah rah motivation.

[00:31:57.920] - Tracy
Motivational speak on planting your flag by Tracy and Caroline. 

[00:32:04.050] - Caroline
Tada!

[00:32:04.580] - Tracy
Okay, so let's talk about planting your flag because let's be honest, the online world is crowded and you really need to find your corner to take your stand and to preach it from the rooftops so that your perfect people can find you.

[00:32:19.350] - Caroline
Yeah, because if you're not taking a stand, think about it. People don't- I tried to convey this earlier and I totally botched it. But think about it. People don't share their favorite blogger unless they have a stand. I'm not going to share about somebody who I can't remember how they feel about something. If you didn't take any kind of a stand, it's not memorable. It's not like there's something that clicks there. It just becomes noise. Do you know what I mean? Like the world of the Internet is full of so many people. If you're going to want to stand out like we do for our businesses, for our brands, for our blogs, we have to stand out. It's our responsibility to stand out to help our people who are out there thinking that nobody gets them. There's people out there right now looking for somebody who has your voice, who has your story, who has your stance on everything that they're thinking. And they're out there right now thinking, ""Nobody gets me.""

[00:33:22.880] - Tracy
Yeah, nobody gets me. Use that flag to bring them in, waving it as hard as you can to get them to see you, to get them to hear you, to get them in your corner so that they can find you.

[00:33:35.390] - Caroline
Yep.

[00:33:36.260] - Tracy
Absolutely.

[00:33:40.290] - Caroline
Do I read it? Do you want to read it?

[00:33:43.680] - Tracy
Go for it. There's a lot of words on this page. You read.

[00:33:45.480] - Caroline
Okay, when you plant your flag, this is how you know that you have hit the planting your flag gold- that you have struck gold on exactly what it is that you are trying to convey in your messaging. You are going to be calling in the right people and you're going to clear out anybody from your world, from your email list who is there for the wrong reason, a.k.a. not your perfect people. You will begin to be able to celebrate your unsubscribes. I know that you guys have heard that for like forever- to celebrate the unsubscribes. You're like, ""But it still hurts."" Here's the thing: When you plant your flag and are able to be fully, authentically you and every single thing that you ever create, you will know that the people who are leaving are not your people and that they are going to make room for the right people on your list.

[00:34:39.570] - Tracy
And that's a game changer when you look at it that way you guys.

[00:34:42.430] - Caroline
I know right?

[00:34:42.540] - Tracy
I mean, I had a hard time with my first couple of unsubscribes. You know what? It's a mindset shift that you need to make. So, don't focus on who's leaving. Focus on who's staying, because those are your people. Those are the people that you're going to turn your blog into an online business with and for. And that is so important for you guys to keep that focus front and center at all times, let everybody else go. You keep your attention where it matters with your perfect person.

[00:35:13.740] - Caroline
Yep. And that way you will be able to explode your list with exactly who you want to talk to, a.k.a. your perfect people.

[00:35:25.530] - Tracy
Absolutely. Absolutely. And we both believe beyond a shadow of a doubt, that you 100% can do it.

[00:35:35.420] - Caroline
Without a question, without a question. Now, we know that it's going to be hard in the beginning. We understand that it's going to be something for you to get over of. Like ""I'm allowed to say my opinion."" Of course you are. And it's going to take some time. And yes, when you first start being able to be authentically you, you are going to see more people leaving your space. But at the same time, you're going to see more people coming in who agree with you. You're going to get more comments, more replies, more likes, more follows from the right people who are like, ""Yes, I thought that I was the only person who thought that. You were going to find your people very, very quickly and know that without a shadow of a doubt that they are there for you, not because they accidentally stumbled across your blog, not because you had the best, shiniest, most, prettiest, most giving everything away a freebie out there. And that was all that they wanted. Another on your list and you're like, ""Oh, crap, how'd I get here?"" You know that you're going to have the right people. We know that you can do it without a question.

[00:36:40.130] - Tracy
Without a question. Okay, so Caroline and I love to give marching orders. And basically what that means is a list of actionable items that you can do to take what we taught you and put it into action, because we're not- we're not about theory. I mean, that's a good thing. But we're not about theory. We're about taking action and implementing the things that we learn. So, we have marching orders for you.

[00:36:40.130] - Caroline
We do. And you can get that as the PDF download if you go to Bloggingonpoint.com/BBS, and we have it for you and it's free. And it's basically this presentation with a few extra little fun things on there for you guys, because there's- there's no reason for you guys to hear more information if you're not going to take action. And so that's what we wanted to give you are some actual action items for you to take from today going forward.

[00:37:33.710] - Caroline
And we cannot wait to see how your business changes and grows and how much more you love being able to do what you do. And don't forget, take us on Instagram.

[00:37:41.870] - Caroline
If you took a screenshot of us being weird, by the way, like it's @Bloggingonpoint, here's a picture of us being all right, guys, that we believe in you and have a great rest of your day.

[00:37:53.630] - Tracy
You got this bye.

[00:37:55.220] - Caroline
Bye.

Liz Stapleton [00:00:00]:
Hi guys. Today's session is with Cindy Bidar and I'm really excited about she's gonna be talking about email marketing funnels and we've touch on this in some other sessions. we talked about using a quiz of the funnel, but I think she's gonna dig into sort

Liz Stapleton [00:00:13]:
of the monetization side of it too, kind of Once you've funneled them onto your list, what do you do as well? If I correct me if I'm wrong, but Cindy, thank you so much for being here. I appreciate it.

Cindy Bidar [00:00:24]:
Thank you. I'm so excited to to join you for this. This is such a an amazing, an amazing event and an an amazing topic to to cover. And I love email marketing, so I'm always happy to talk about it. Like, one of my favorite things.

Liz Stapleton [00:00:41]:
so can you give us just a little bit sort of back your about your background so we kinda know where you're coming from and then the highlights of what you're gonna cover in your presentation.

Cindy Bidar [00:00:49]:
Sure. So my background is I have worked full time online, for the past 9 years now. I started out as a content and copywriter as a freelancer. I moved from there into virtual assistance, and I did technical and marketing virtual assistance for several years. And now I have shifted away from doing the client work, and I'm doing online training and education around marketing for coaches and bloggers and other service providers. Okay. So that's kind of my, my career arc there in a nutshell. And what I focus on now is teaching people how to automate their marketing, how to systemize their marketing, how to create the processes and the procedures, so that they can make more money and spend a lot less time in their office.

Liz Stapleton [00:01:39]:
Awesome. I like it. So can you tell us sort of what attendees are gonna walk away with from your session, like the highlight points of what you're gonna cover.

Cindy Bidar [00:01:47]:
Yeah. Absolutely. So what I find in talking to my clients is that a lot of times, they don't really know where to get started with email marketing. So what I've put together is a presentation that's going to walk them through exactly how to start to build that email marketing list, what to do with those people when they're on their once they're on the list, how to kind of monetize it without feeling all icky all the time about being all salesy. so that's kind of the gist of of what we're gonna cover in the next 30 minutes or so.

Liz Stapleton [00:02:20]:
Okay. Awesome. I'm I'm excited to dig in.

Cindy Bidar [00:02:24]:
Alright. Thanks, Elizabeth, for thta great intro. It's really, like I said, it's really great to join you here for the Blogger Breakthrough Summit, and this is such an important topic. So Let's dig right in with easy email funnels that serve your audience and earn a profit too, and they won't be icky. I promise. Here's what I hear from pretty much everybody. when they're first starting out, whether that's you know, whether they're bloggers or they're, affiliate marketers or they're service providers or they're authors. It doesn't matter who they are. the the common statement is I don't even know where to start with building a marketing funnel. And I will tell you what, I have a little survey when people First, join my list that asks them what do they most need help with when it comes to building marketing funnels and probably 80% of the responses are I don't even know where to start. So if that's you, super super common. You are not alone. You are in some very good company. And even more importantly, that's where we all were when we first started out. So it's easy to overcome. I'm gonna help you get started today. And where do we start? Before you even think about the technology, before you even think about making sales offers, before you even think about what a funnel does or how it works, I want you to start with the goal in mind. and not just your goal. Although that's important, we're gonna start with your goal, but we wanna talk about Another goal. We wanna talk about your ideal client's goals because those 2 things, your goal and her goal, and I'm gonna I'm gonna call your ideal client her throughout this presentation. That's just the pronoun that I use. So if your ideal client is a man, This works too. But we're gonna talk about your goal and we're gonna talk about her goal and how they both work together to build an email funnel that serves and earns a profits. Now your goal, this is easy. At least I think it's easy for you. Your goal, you have something to sell. You sell a product. Maybe it's a digital product. Maybe it's an ebook. maybe you sell consulting or coaching or maybe you sell physical products on Etsy or Maybe your whole goal is to drive traffic back to your website, so that you can present people with display ads, and that's how you earn on your blog. Whatever your goal is, that's kind of the first piece that you're gonna keep in mind. where do I want people to go? Where do I ultimately want to send them through the use of this email funnel that I'm building? I want you to keep that in mind as we work kinda through the rest of this. Next, I want you to think about what does your ideal client want? because that's really even more important. If you want to build relationships with people through an email funnel, then you have to start with What do they want? What can you provide to them that's gonna satisfy that need? And we're gonna talk about a a technique that I use to do this in just a second, but I want you to I wanna share an example with you. one of my clients, for example, has, or he is a dating and relationship coach for women in midlife. And what his clients want, what they say they want, and what they actually want are 2 very different things. And that's where 5 whys technique comes in. So what his clients say they want is they want to get married or they want a committed relationship or they want to meet a nice man who's not already married or they want someone to be with on Valentine's day. Right? But that's not -- what they really want. When we dig deeper, when we use this 5 whys technique, and the way this works is to just continue continually ask why, right, just like a toddler just asks why all the time. Why? Why? Why? Why? If you've ever been around a toddler, maybe you've been really annoyed by that. I know I have. I don't have kids. So, you know, it I don't get toddlers, but I know they question everything. And I want you to do that as well when you're building out your email funnel. And here's why. Because What your ideal client says he or she wants is probably not the whole truth. So if we go back to my client and his dating and relationship coaching, his ideal client would say they wanna get married. But if you dig deeper, if you ask why, why do they wanna get married? Well, because they want security or they want companionship. Why do they want security and companionship? because they're lonely. Why are they lonely? Well, maybe because they don't have any friends or maybe they live far away from their family, Well, why is that? And when you really dig deep into it, what he has discovered is what his clients really want is they want to be happy in their life, and they feel that by meeting someone by meeting the right man, that's going to make them happy. But what he's discovered is that's not really the case that happiness actually comes from the inside. So if he can help them find that internal happiness, then that's a better service for them than just helping them meet some random guy on a Tinder app. So that's the kind of dig. That's the kind of deep digging I want to encourage you to do when you're thinking about what does your ideal client or what does your ideal customer or your ideal reader? What do they really want? They and and what they really want may not be what they say they want. So you have to be able to read between the lines and really know them and under stand their motivations and where they're coming from and what their goal really is. And that's gonna put you on the right path to building that email marketing funnel. Here's another way to look at it by asking the so what question? This comes from copywriting. If you've done any copywriting written any sales pages, read any copywriting books, you've probably come across this this technique of differentiating the features from the benefits. So a feature is a description of something. my coffee cup is blue. That's a feature of it. So what? That's the benefit if I answer that So what question I can get to the benefit of having a blue coffee cup? So what? Well, I like the color blue. That's what? So asking that so what question is really gonna help you as well dig into that why your customers want what they want or why your ideal clients want what they want. So they, you know, in the case of my dating and relationship coach client, he his clients think that they want to get married. Well, so what? So they won't be lonely anymore. That's their goal. So if the 5 why's question is kinda stumping you a little bit, then ask yourself So what? When they get this, so what? When they get this thing that they want, so what? What's what's the what there? Alright. So now that we know what your ideal customer's big goal is, what she really, really wants. Let's talk about how you can use your email funnel to help her, help her get there. And the way that we do that is by addressing the elephant in the room. We wanna figure out what's standing in her way and help her get past those hurdles. One big hurdle is tools and technology. So is she lacking the proper equipment, the supplies or other necessary items? An example of this would be if you say you teach, say you teach piano lessons online, maybe you have a membership that that has a piano training, video training inside. If your ideal customer doesn't have a piano, It's gonna be really hard for her to make use of your training. So your job is to, as the expert here, is to make the recommendations to help her make good buying decisions and to help her decide which tools and which technology are the right fit for her. So another example is say you have a recipe blog. Right? Recipe blogs are Super common these days and super helpful. I spend a ton of time browsing recipe blogs. I'll tell you what. I love to read stories. I love to read about new techniques, new to me, and, learn new recipes and also I need the help in the kitchen with the tools and the technology. It was through a recipe blog that I bought my instant pot. It was through a recipe blog that I order new, you know, new to me spices that I've never tried before. So The tools and the technology that are required for your ideal customer to reach her goal are one important part of your funnel content. And, of course, the way you make money with that is by recommending products that you have an affiliate relationship with. What else is standing in her way? Knowledge gaps are a big one. Does she have the basic skills in place, or does she need a quick refresher course? you can easily fill an email funnel with ""how to"" content that helps your reader or your ideal customer build up those skills. So, again, you know, I if I'm subscribed to a recipe blog and I am interested in learning how, you know, learning how to, cook a really great steak. or grill a really great steak. An email that teaches me the techniques to do that, how to know what the proper temperature of the grill is, and and how to get that that really important seared look on the steak and how to make it fork tender on the grill without turning it into a piece of leather. Those things in an email funnel are gonna be very, very helpful to me. They're not immediately monetizable. They're not they're not gonna bring you immediate money probably, but they're gonna go a long ways toward building those important relationships and keeping your, your email subscribers engaged and active on your email list and reading your emails and moving through your funnel and and making their way towards not only her goal, but yours as well, which is the ultimate goal that you have for your email subscribers. Another thing that you can address in your email funnel is a lack of confidence. This can keep people from trying new things, it can keep people from stepping out of their comfort zone, but it can be easily overcome with the right content. And the types of content that addresses a lack of confidence in your audience are things like case studies or testimonials where you've had other clients or or even yourself where you've overcome some challenge and achieved a goal that is related to what your ideal customer wants. Those kinds of inspirational stories. An example of this is gonna be like weight watchers. If you've ever been on weight watchers or you've ever subscribed to their content, or I would imagine other other weight loss platforms, you know, Jenny Craig, whatever, all have similar, similar styles in their email funnel They will send these inspirational stories about how Sarah lost 75 pounds and you see the before and after picture that can build up the confidence in somebody, build up their, their desire for the goal Plus give them the encouragement to think, hey. If Sarah did this, I can do it too. So the that kind of content has a really important place in your email funnel. No time or money. This is really I gotta be honest here. This is really rarely a real issue. Most often, these are simply objections that people throw out because they can't think of any other reason why they wouldn't buy whatever it is you are offering. And you can address those objections throughout your sales process, throughout your email funnel, and really overcome them easily by not even addressing them directly because what's important to people. If you get to that, if you go back to when we talked about what the real goal is, what the real need is, if you can dig into that and skip past that surface need that they think they want and get to the real issue, then the no time or money thing is not even gonna come up because what people really, really want, what they're really passionate about, what they really desire, they will find the time and the money for. So if you're hearing this objection or you're seeing this objection or you know, your your people are telling you, yeah, that's that's an interesting that's an interesting idea, and I would totally get that, but I don't have the time to study that, or I don't have the money to buy that right now. Then I would say you're probably not getting at the real root goal. You're not digging deep enough into that. Now I don't care what it is that you are selling, what it is that your ultimate funnel goal is There are 3 elements that you need to address within your email funnel in order to make that sale at the end, and that's know, have, and believe. And let's start with the 'know'. Your subscribers, your email subscribers, the people who opt into your list, your community at large, has a prerequisite. They need to know certain things before they can make use of whatever it is you are selling and I don't care if what you're selling is consulting or if what you're selling is an instant pot through an Amazon link or what you're selling is a multi-module training course that you developed and sell for 1000 of dollars. There are certain things that your ideal client needs to know before she can take advantage of any offer. And I'm gonna tell you in just a second how you can address this need in your email funnel, but let's take a look at have and believe first. So the second thing that is required in an email funnel or that is required of your ideal customer for they can make a buying choice is they have to have some things in place. What do they need to already have at their disposal? to make use of your product. This might be tangible things. It might be the tools or the technology or the supplies. Maybe they need paintbrushes or they need an instant pot or they need a piano. Or it can be the intangible things like we talked about the self confidence or the perception of enough time. So what is your ideal customer need to have? And, again, I'm gonna share, I'm gonna tell you exactly how to give that to them in your email funnel in just a second, but before we get there, they also need to believe certain things. Your ideal buyer needs to believe that not only is she capable of achieving this goal, but that you are capable of helping her to get there. And that's important, and we're gonna go over that in just a second. So know, have, and believe. These are three things that you must cover in your email funnel. Okay. So how do we actually put this to work inside your email funnel? So the know piece becomes informational content. This is commonly called nurturing. This is where you are sending your email client or you're email subscribers. You are sending them things like ""how to"" blog posts, video demonstrations, checklists, webinars, and other free training that can fill in those knowledge gaps that they have in order to prepare them to take advantage of your offer at the end of the funnel. So for example, You might have, like I said, ""how to"" blog posts. You might have YouTube, videos that you've recorded that demonstrate a technique you might have checklist to help them follow a pros a process or a procedure. You might have free webinars that offer more information. You might have other free training that they can opt in for that's going to help them build those skills and fill in those gaps in their knowledge. The 'have' component, now this is where we get promotional, and this is where I get a lot of pushback from people, if I'm honest, because people tend to think that it's not okay to sell. And I wanna tell you that it is absolutely okay to sell in your email funnels. In fact, it's your job to sell in your email funnels. I wanna tell you something that I learned in the in the corporate world. Before I worked online, I was a buyer for a smallish factory, automotive factory here in Michigan where I live. And I was the only buyer. So I was, like, in charge of purchasing everything from the nuts and bolts that held the machines together to the raw material we used to create the parts, to the tires on the truck that we used to deliver them. everything came across my desk, and it was not unusual for the department head to call me up and say, you know, hey, I need a, I need a particular grade of cardboard to pack these parts in, and we're having a problem you know, with the parts getting damaged on the way. So we need to figure out a new way to pack those. Order me some cardboard boxes for that. Well, I I don't know anything about cardboard boxes. This is not my this is not I didn't go to school and learn about cardboard, but I had people I could turn to, and those people were the salesman. That's their job. It's their job to know all about the cardboard. It's their job to know all about nuts and bolts and screws and cleaning materials and tie truck tires. And The list goes on. There is an army of salespeople out there who are very, very knowledgeable, and all I had to do was pick up the phone and call them. And they would help me figure it out. And that's your job too. It's your job to help your ideal customer make informed buying decisions, whether that is an informed buying decision about your product or an informed buying decision about an affiliate product that you are promoting in your email funnel. The key is that it needs to satisfy this 'have' portion of your funnel. It needs to satisfy a need for your ideal client. And ideally, it needs to help her get one step closer to taking advantage of your offer. Whatever it is that you're selling, whether that's coaching and consulting, or a course, or just additional resources that you are an affiliate for. So your promotional content, those sales emails definitely have a place in your email funnel, and they are of service to your ideal client. So I don't want you to ever forget that. I don't want you to ever think that sending sales emails is annoying or it's icky or you shouldn't be doing it because you absolutely should. It is your job as the expert in your market to be sharing that information with ideal customer. Okay. I wanna skip back to this slide for just just a minute here because this is really important. We talked about asking, so what? We talked about the difference between the features and the benefits. And often what I see happening in email funnels is If you are promoting a particular product or a particular course or a particular, you know, kitchen appliance, whatever it is, whatever it is that you are offering that your ideal customer needs to have in order to take advantage of what your larger offer is. You need to get super clear on the so what piece of that because that's what's gonna make the connection between what you're offering, what you're selling, and what their ideal or what their ultimate goal is, what they really, really want to achieve and why they're listening to you in the first place. A really simple example of this, I told you that I bought my instant pot through a recipe blog, through a link on a recipe blog from Amazon. And I'm certain that the the blogger got an affiliate commission on that, at least I hope she did. But the reason why it the reason why I clicked that link, the reason why I bought it is because she made it clear that the instant pot was not just a pressure cooker. It was not just, you know, a a $100 appliance. It was it was the way that she expressed the so what that made it clear to me that that was what was going to bring me closer to my goal of spending less time in the kitchen and eating delicious food and not having to, you know, spend an hour a half cooking it. So she made that connection between the instant pot that's a pressure cooker and the so what, which is eat delicious food in less time and and make it easier to cook. So that was the so what of the instant pot. And that led naturally to my bigger desire, my bigger goal of more variety in my meals, and less time in the kitchen. So make that connection by really getting clear on what is the so what of whatever it is you're offering. And then the last piece, of course, is the belive. So this is where that inspirational content comes in that we talked about. This is where you're going to be sharing case studies and interviews and testimonials and photos and video and data, if it is applicable. So in my case, data is super applicable because I teach people how to make more money online. So data is important to me if you're teaching people how to use their instant pot, maybe not so much. But interviews and testimonials and photos and video, absolutely. make it real for your ideal customer. Make them believe that they can have that too, that they can achieve that goal that they can have that beautiful Christmas dinner that they can have that amazing relationship they can learn to play the piano, whatever it is that you are teaching, whatever it is that you are selling, the inspirational content piece of your marketing funnel, is where that all comes together for them and where they start to picture it and visualize it for themselves. Alright. So let's recap. When it comes to building an email marketing funnel, what you're going to do is start Always, always, always start with the goal in mind. Keep your goal in mind and your ideal customer's goal. And not just the surface-level goal, dig deep and find out what the real goal is that she has because it's probably -- not what she's telling you. You can use the 5 why's technique or ask yourself, so what? Why does she want what she's telling me she wants? So what? What's that gonna do for her in the end? that's gonna help you dig in and really get to that really real felt need. Next, you're gonna wanna uncover the roadblocks while stopping her from being there now. What's keeping her from having that relationship what's keeping her from creating that beautiful dinner for her family. What's keeping her from learning to play the piano at sixty years old. What is preventing her? What's standing in her way from getting what she really, really wants? Next, address the knows, the how, the haves, and the believes. What does she need to know in order to get there? What does she need to have in place in order to get there? And what she need to believe not only about herself, but about you or about the world in general before she's ready to take action. And finally, throughout your entire email funnel, be the resource that your client needs. They know people don't sign up for your email list because they want you to send them a bunch of fluff. They don't sign up for your email list because you had a cute picture on your on your homepage. They sign up for your email list because they see you as an expert in what you talk about. And as the expert, you have a duty to your email community to be the resource that they need to find success in whatever your niche is, whatever your industry is, whatever your subject matter is. Be the resource that your client needs and don't Don't fall into the trap of thinking that you can't email them offers or that you can't share these amazing resources with them because because people will think that you're spammy or that you are just selling all the time. Don't fall into that trap that it's icky because it is not. It is in the highest service to your ideal customer to be making those offers, and it's what keeps your business in the black. Without the income from your email marketing efforts, you're gonna have to work so much harder in your business just to stay afloat. So don't look at it as if you are being too salesy or too icky or too spammy. Look at it as if you are serving your clients because you are. And you're serving yourself as well by giving yourself the gift of a good income from this business that you work so hard in. I know that sometimes we we might struggle with taking the information that we learn in a training like this and actually putting it into practice. So I want to give you a resource that I created as a part of a paid training product. My funnels 101 course. I wanna give you this resource. It's an email funnel planner. And what it's going to help you do is it's gonna walk you through the different types of emails that you might send in an email funnel. Now the example that I'm using, it is an example from that course is, someone who sells or Christmas ornament patterns and Christmas ornament supplies. So you'll see the example given in in this worksheet of the ideal customer wanting to create a better Christmas memories for her grandchildren but the concept works regardless of what your ideal customer's ultimate goal is And you will see on this worksheet that I've laid out a hypothetical funnel that addresses all of the roadblocks and the know's, the haves, and the belives that we talked about in this training, and you can then take that and plug in your own customers roadblocks and your own customers knows, haves, and believes and actually write out the email funnel that's going to lead her to your ultimate funnel goal, which is to make a purchase by your product hire you for consulting or whatever that case is. So I wanna invite you to download that and work through that as you're building out your own email funnels. I really hope you have found this information helpful and that you are able to go forward and create email funnels that serve your customers and serve you as well. It's been my pleasure to speak with you today. Thank you so much for being here.

Liz Stapleton [00:00:00]:
All right, guys, I'm really excited for this session with Angel from ConvertKit. Thank you so much for being here. Yes, thank you for having me. This is going to be a lot of fun. Yeah, because I started using ConvertKit, like back in 2015, which was still kind of not a lot of people had heard of it by then. I feel like that was such a long time ago. Oh, yeah. Those are our baby stages.

Angel Marie [00:00:21]:
Yes. And so I am a big fan of the platform. Can you tell us a little bit what we're going to learn today? Just a little bit about your background, too. Yeah, of course. So I'm the creator educator with ConverKit. I am the one that produces and hosts the online workshops that you guys are going to be attending very shortly. But this is just where I walk you through different steps and strategies on how to grow your very own online business, whether it's a blog or a specific product or service. I just teach you the behind the scenes and all the strategies so that you know exactly how to set yourself and your business up for success to make that happen.

Angel Marie [00:00:59]:
Now, ConverKit is an email service provider, so we will be diving deep into email marketing and how that can benefit your business, all of that good stuff. We'll definitely make sure that we're as clear as possible so that, again, I can help you set yourself up for success. Yeah, because you're going to be talking about how to start and grow your email list. Exactly. Yeah, because we have other sessions on what to do with your email list once you have one, but getting it set up, because that's one of the biggest mistakes I made was I had no clue what I was doing. And so when I finally really got to email marketing, I had all these forms and it was just like, unmanageable, and it was so much work to clean it up. And I was like, if only I had started right. And I have a friend who's starting a blog right now.

Angel Marie [00:01:41]:
It was like, for the love of everything, promise me you're going to set up right. Have to clean up. Yeah, I definitely understand that. I'm really excited for your session. I'm going to go ahead and let you take over. Sounds good. Let's get started. Hey, everybody.

Angel Marie [00:01:59]:
I'm Angel Marie, creator, educator with ConverKit. And I just want to say welcome and thank you to joining the Blogger Breakthrough Summit. I hope you guys have been having a great time so far. I am going to be diving into how to start and how to build your email list absolutely from scratch. So the first thing I'm going to do is go ahead and share my screen so that you all can see exactly what I am looking at right now. Now, this is going to be your ultimate email starter kit. All right, we'll be going into detail as far as how you can actually start an email list and how you can build it absolutely from scratch. Now, an email list, if you don't know already, an email list is so, so valuable when it comes to making a living.

Angel Marie [00:02:44]:
As a creator, as a blogger, as a freelancer. It is everything when it comes to the success of your business. And that is because an email list is literally a group of superfans that love your work, they love your content, they love your emails and they are ready to buy from you. And we'll get more into detail when it comes to the value of email marketing up ahead as well. As I said earlier, my name is Angel Marie, creator educator with ConvertKit. And I just have the incredible opportunity to be able to work alongside top creators every single day. Just really knowing and getting a sense of what is working in the online entrepreneurial space and what is not working. And it's a huge passion just to be able to teach you those strategies so that you know how to implement them into your very own businesses as well.

Angel Marie [00:03:35]:
However, I am all about personable relationships, so I would love to share more of my story. This is Angel Marie. About a year and a half ago. This was actually a video that my friends had taken inside of my place at that time. And I had to screenshot a picture of what I looked like in that video because I was like, man, this is exactly how I was feeling every single day. I was stuck, I was frustrated, and I was going through something called the Dreamer Struggle, where I had this dream, right? I had this amazing idea of a blog that I wanted to start and how I wanted to make it profitable, but I just didn't know the steps. I didn't understand the benefits of email marketing. The online world was so big and it still is so big and it's beautiful that there is so much information out there, but at the same time, it might feel just a tad overwhelming because of all that information.

Angel Marie [00:04:31]:
So I am here to teach you that step by step, from the very beginning, from scratch, so that you know exactly what to do right here, right now, to take your business to the next level using email marketing. Now, what is ConvertKit? I said that I am a creator educator with ConvertKit earlier. ConvertKit is an email service provider that specifically exists to help creators earn a living. Not only that, but we help you earn a living doing what it is that you love most. That is our mission, that is our motto. That is literally what we stand by. Now, later on in this workshop, I am going to be doing a demo of what it looks like inside of ConvertKit. I'll be showing you that in a little bit later.

Angel Marie [00:05:16]:
However, it's very important for you to know that no matter what email service provider you use, the strategies that I'm going to be sharing with you throughout this workshop will still work for you regardless of what email service provider you use, okay? So definitely stay tuned. We got some great stuff coming up ahead. Now, if you are wanting to find ways to connect with your audience and you are all about wanting to know how to make a living doing the work that you love, then you're in the right place, right? You are in this summit. You are watching this workshop for a reason. You are definitely in the right place. So give yourself a huge round of applause. Because I'm telling you, as a creator, as somebody who's trying to build a blog or a business, you deserve that. You deserve that self appreciation.

Angel Marie [00:06:04]:
So you are definitely here in the right place, and we're going to be bringing a lot of value towards your way today. Now we're going to be talking about how creators are using email newsletters to start their email list. We're also going to go over how to brand your newsletters to attract future buyers and then how to share your newsletter so you can grow a list of superfans even if you have absolutely no tech experience. So definitely stay tuned. A lot of good stuff coming up ahead. And we have a special bonus for you towards the end that we would love to gift to you all as well. So definitely stay tuned. Now, let's talk about email marketing just for a quick second so that we can make sure we're all on the same page.

Angel Marie [00:06:50]:
Creators who use email marketing earn 447% more revenue than those who don't. Okay? That is $7,000 without email versus $40,000 with email. Huge difference there, right? And we've discovered this in doing our research. But this clearly and visually shows the value that email marketing has when it comes to the growth of your sales, your blog, and your overall business just by implementing email marketing into your business strategies. And I wanted to share this quote by Melissa. She had said, I signed up for ConvertKit in September 2016. By January 2017, my monthly sales had tripled and I was making more per month than I ever did in the corporate world. This quote I have not only gotten from Alyssa, but I've gotten similar quotes regarding making a living doing what it is online just by getting serious with email marketing.

Angel Marie [00:07:49]:
And a lot of our top creators have told us this is just the fact that email marketing has had such a huge value on their business. Now, there's things like social media, Facebook, Instagram, Pinterest, where you can gain a following and people love your pictures and your stuff. All of that stuff is great. I still recommend using those. However, when it comes to social media, they own that, right? So Instagram owns your following, facebook owns your friends, they own that platform. And there's so many algorithms in place as well that are in the mix of it. When it comes to your email list, you own that, those are your people, they are not going anywhere. And that is the beautiful thing about it, which is why I'm so passionate about email marketing and helping you implement those strategies into your business as well.

Angel Marie [00:08:37]:
Now, let's kind of talk about the flow of how email marketing works. It's all going to start off with someone who subscribes to get your newsletter content, right? This person is interested. They want to hear what you have to say. That is why they gave you their email address in the first place. They are letting you inside of their virtual world, right? They're letting you inside of their inbox and that's a big deal. And then from there, you consistently send helpful emails and behind the scenes. Now, what I mean by that is you are sending emails that give them advice, that give them tips, that make them smile, you're giving them free gifts, you're telling them about your creative process and sharing all of the behind the scenes. Those helpful emails are everything when it comes to really growing those personable relationships and building trust with your subscribers so that they can turn into ready to buy clients or ready to buy customers.

Angel Marie [00:09:32]:
Super important when it comes to that. Because at the end of the day, we want our businesses to be profitable, right? We want people to like our stuff so much to the point where they do want to buy from us. And this is the step by step process of what it takes to actually get there. Now, let's dive deep into point number one in today's workshop, how creators are using email newsletters to start their email list. So when you think about it and you ask yourself that question of how they are making a living doing what it is that they love with email newsletters, they do this by reaching, teaching and treating their audience. And I'll break each one of these down step by step just so I can be as clear as possible for sure. Now, when I say reach, I'm talking about building your subscribers, expanding your audience. You're also building interest, increasing the engagement of those that want to interact with your content.

Angel Marie [00:10:28]:
They want to read your stuff, they are interested in what you have to say. And then of course, building sales. So boosting conversion rates, turning them from a subscriber into an eventual customer as well. And then there's teach. So when I say teach, I'm talking about teaching everything. You know, transferring knowledge, this is huge because when you know something that somebody else does not, you are bringing knowledge their way. You're telling them, hey, I know this and I can help you out. And because you've done that, you have built trust, you're bringing results their way.

Angel Marie [00:11:04]:
You're bringing them value. And then of course, work in public, which means creating personable relationships. When you work in public versus working in private, you are sharing more of your story. You're sharing the behind the scenes. You're letting them know more about you and your process and your story and your experiences. This is important to build those personable relationships so that your audience, your email list can trust what you have to say and therefore want to buy from you. And then there's treat. So when I say treat, I'm talking about giving a piece of content, right? Creating a product or service that brings results.

Angel Marie [00:11:42]:
You are treating your email list, you're treating your audience with this content that helps them, that brings them results. And then there's offer too, offering a discount, offering a certain value on. There an exclusive piece of content that you are providing to them so that they feel special because they really, truly are special. Those are your people, your group of fans that care to hear what you have to say. And then there's a freebie. This is just a free gift to give away. Free gifts are great. Everybody loves a free gift, right? If you send out free gifts to your email list, you are not only building trust, but you're also boosting their interest because they're saying, wow, this person is giving me a free gift.

Angel Marie [00:12:25]:
This is awesome. I love it. The next time they have something that they're going to sell, I'm going to buy it because I have already loved their free stuff. So I can only imagine what their stuff is like when I actually buy it. So, so valuable. Now let's dive into number two, which is how to brand your newsletter to attract those future buyers. Step number one is to know your product or service. So when you think about that, you want to think, what could you talk about all day? Maybe you already know your product or service.

Angel Marie [00:12:57]:
That is beautiful, but maybe you don't. So really you want to think about what is it that you could talk about all day? What do people come to you for? What can you help people with? And then step number two, you're going to research your people. So one, know your product or service. Step number two, research your people. When I say that, I am saying finding out who your business is going to help, who is that ideal audience member? What do they look like? What are their wants? What are their needs? What are they asking? How can you better serve them? Research is so, so important, whether you're at those beginning stages of your business or in the later stages of your business, because people's minds are constantly evolving, right? And it's up to you as a blogger, as a creator, as the online business entrepreneur that you are, to keep up with that mental evolution so that you know how to help them out further. So when you think about researching your people, you want to figure out what questions they are asking. And these are all of the sites that you can go on to truly find those questions. So answer the public is perfect.

Angel Marie [00:14:06]:
YouTube, Pinterest, sending out a survey to friends, to family, to your current email list if you do have one. Making a phone call and then using social media so you could find a profile of someone who has a business that's similar to yours and just look at their comments. What are people saying? What do they love? What are they maybe not liking so much, getting a feel for that so that you know how to better serve them. From there, you're going to make a list of all of those questions. Circle the questions that you would love to answer. Now these can be questions that you can either answer right away or you know that you could find the answer to. So circle the questions you would love to answer and then you're going to find those answers in your work, find the answers in what you can do, find the answers in your product, your service, your creativity. And then you want to ask yourself what results will these answers give someone? Right? Research your people.

Angel Marie [00:15:04]:
You're going to find their questions. You're going to circle the questions you want to answer. And then you're going to find those questions in your work and really dive deep into what value will this bring someone? What results can this bring somebody? You are going to use all of that to brand your newsletter in order to get people on your email list. Okay? And we're going to be diving into some examples so I can share with you what I mean by that. This is an example from Emily Dedi. She is an historical fiction writer. She's absolutely awesome. And she did this background research that we just talked about and she decided to have her newsletter where it says the form in the left corner where people can put in their email address.

Angel Marie [00:15:49]:
She decided to revolve that around a historical fiction reading challenge. She knew that her audience wanted to have more fun. She wanted to get them hyped up about it. So she created a challenge for them. And this worked really, really well for her because she did the research in the back end. Super important. All right, step number three. After knowing your product or service and researching your ideal audience members, step number three is to start your newsletter headline, right? What is that headline going to be? Now here are some headline prompts just to get your brains flowing, to get you brainstorming on what your newsletter headline would look like.

Angel Marie [00:16:30]:
And again, if you are wanting to see some examples of newsletters, we are going to be going over that in just a little bit. But right now I want to get you brainstorming on what your newsletter headline would look like. So it could be a key result. You think your newsletter could give someone a newsletter name idea, a specific quality of your ideal subscriber? What is one big desire your audience has, an audience FAQ or a free gift idea? All of these are great prompts to use when it comes to really thinking, okay, what is my headline going to be on this exact newsletter and figuring out how you can attract more eyes on it. How can you get more people to give you their email address because of the headline that they just read? And then step number four is to start your newsletter content, right? So we started off with your newsletter headline. Now you want to go towards your newsletter content. So what is your content actually going to be saying? What are you actually going to be giving? Now let's go over some ideas of what your newsletter content is going to look like. You could take the content from a weekly emails perspective.

Angel Marie [00:17:42]:
And when I say that, you are going to talk about it from a dreaming of result, whatever that result may be, join whatever that newsletter name is, right? That newsletter headline for weekly emails to help you what, what is that result? And this is an example of what I mean by that, by Issa Admi. She is a storyteller at ConvertKit and you can see in her newsletter she had said, have a big dream. Join the Keep Going Club for short emails every Wednesday to help you go for it. Okay? So she's telling them the results. She's letting them know what to expect when they're going to be getting those weekly emails. So using that content can be great to get more people to subscribe because you're sharing result oriented messaging and you're setting up their expectations as well. You could also take it from the free gift perspective. So this would be something like want to know how to get how I got this result? Join the newsletter name to get free gift and awesome weekly emails to help you what what is that result? And here's an example of what that looked like.

Angel Marie [00:18:50]:
What, what that looks like from Pat Flynn. Pat Flynn is absolutely awesome if you ever want to check him out, by the way. But he had said join the SBI newsletter, right? And once people put in their name and email address, they automatically would get the email the smart way playbook that he would give to them for free. And because he decided to give out a free gift, he got more people on his newsletter. He got more people to put in their email address because he gave away a free gift. Another great idea that you could do to start your email list right away. You could also take it from a community standpoint here. You would say join a community of blank whatever that quality number is, who receive what result in their inboxes.

Angel Marie [00:19:35]:
And this is an example of what that looks like from Vanessia Darby, who is a consultant, where you can see, she said, join 200 plus creatives who receive motivation in their inboxes, which is awesome. She's letting people know, hey, when you join, you're going to be a part of a community of other people. She's sharing that other people are in this community. She's letting them know that her motivational emails, what it is that she offers, they do work because she already has a community set up which makes people want to sign up, makes people want to give them their email address. So you could also take it from the community perspective as well. And then there's the big question. In this case, this would say something like, want to learn blank whatever that big desire is, join the newsletter name. And this is what that would look like.

Angel Marie [00:20:24]:
This is an example from Rachel Rogers. She has that big question right at the top where she says, want to learn exactly what you should be working on to scale your business? And the minute people clicked I want in, they would be prompted to put in their name and their email address. Now, this was great because Rachel knew a frequently asked question that was floating around on the Internet. And this goes back to point number two, which is researching your people and finding what it is that they want. She discovered that people were wanting to know how to scale their businesses, which is great. And because she put this question up here on her newsletter, she was able to gain more people, right? She was able to gain and increase her email list because she took the time to do that. Then you could also take it from the work in public perspective. Now, what does work in public mean? Work in public means that you are not working in private, right? You are sharing your creative process.

Angel Marie [00:21:25]:
You're sharing your successes. You're sharing your downfalls. You're bringing them along the journey with you and letting them know more about you and your life. You are sharing the real you. And that is huge when it comes to building trust with your audience so that they can then turn into those future buyers. So this would say something like struggling to blank whatever that big desire is. I'm and then what? That what your name is. And I've experienced blank whatever your story or that life update may be.

Angel Marie [00:21:57]:
And this is what I mean by that. Now, when you do a work in public stance on this newsletter, it might be a little bit longer, and that's okay. It's completely up to you and how you're wanting to go about it. This is another example from Issa where she told a little bit more about her story. She let them know her name, what she's doing right now, she's working in public so that people can know a little bit more about her. Super important. Also take note of the fact that all of these examples that I showed you, none of them say join the newsletter and then that's it, right? They're more specific. They're more result oriented.

Angel Marie [00:22:35]:
They're giving people away things like motivation, inspiration, or a free gift. They're letting people know what to expect. You want it to be more specific so that people can know what to look forward to before they put their email address in. That is super important to make it personable to be unique and to be yourself when figuring out the headline and the content of your newsletter. So here are some work in public prompts. I wanted to write these out to help you out. If you are one of those people that is wanting to work in public and wants to share more of your story, which I definitely recommend, these are just some prompts that you can definitely take a look at and take notes on so that you know what to talk about. What was the big conflict in your life that led you to wanting to start this business or community? How did you get the idea? What are you excited about right now? What are you struggling with right now? You didn't think it was possible, but right? All of these are great when it comes to sharing your story and bringing your audience along the journey with you so that you can build that trust and turn subscribers into future buyers as well.

Angel Marie [00:23:44]:
Now let's dive into number three, which is how to share your newsletter so you can grow a list of those super fans even if you have no tech experience. Number one is to create a landing page to share your newsletter. And I'm going to show you exactly what to do. I'm just going to switch screens so that you guys can see my demo account and can easily follow along with me on here with how to set up a landing page inside of ConvertKit. And what I mean when I say to grow your newsletter and to start that newsletter now. So this is ConvertKit, my demo account. I am going to be on Landing Pages and forms. Now keep in mind this is the ConverKit free account where all of the rest of these will be blocked off.

Angel Marie [00:24:33]:
I am going to be able to grow my audience for free in ConvertKit just by heading to this Landing Page and forms tab. I'm going to head down here to create new and then from there I'm going to choose a landing page. Now a form, it can be embedded on your website or a sales page. Landing Page captures email addresses in that same way. It's just that bigger picture feel. It's perfect, especially for those who don't have a website yet. So I'm just going to go ahead and click on Landing page. So many templates and designs for you to specifically choose from.

Angel Marie [00:25:07]:
It is absolutely awesome. You can even go by category. To get more specific, I'm just going to go to all so that you can see all the different designs that are available to you completely for free. Again, this is just the ConvertKit free account. I'm going to go to this template, click choose, and then from there, this is where all of your amazing, beautiful customization comes into play. So I'm just going to go over here and name this landing page. So let's say I want to give a free gift away so that I can start growing my email list. Maybe I'm going to give away a webinar checklist.

Angel Marie [00:25:44]:
Maybe I do do webinars all the time. So in my case it would be great for me to create a checklist and to give it to people who are wanting to create a webinar, right? So in this case I would put in the heading maybe Webinar Checklist or even better, Free Webinar Checklist so that people know that, hey, this is free and I'm giving it to you. All you have to do is put in your email address and then enter a catchy page headline. This might say something like how to create a high Converting Webinar or something like that. And then in the subtitle this might be something like learn the five blank. And this plus button right here allows you to add in a numbered list or bullet points if I'm wanting to name off some of the results that people will be getting if they sign up to get this checklist. So result number one would be get more subscribers. Result number two, grow your sales.

Angel Marie [00:26:39]:
You know what I mean? Just really putting in that clear messaging is great. You can even put in an image on here, which is awesome. Or a button or a divider. A lot of places to work with on this landing page. And then from here the subscribe button. You can change this out to say something like yes, I'm in, right? Something that's in first person again, make it you put it in your own voice. Now if I go to this editing wand tool, I can change out the background image. Maybe I want to keep this the way that it is, which is great, but maybe I want to change it out.

Angel Marie [00:27:12]:
So I would just go to replace image and I can upload any images that are in my download or desktop. Or I have the option to use the onsplash integration which is automatically already inside of ConverKit, which means that you have access to thousands of professional and clear photos that you can use right away. Absolutely for free. Now let's say I don't have a clear image on a checklist, right? Because I want my headline to match the imagery. I could easily type in checklist to see what comes up. Let's say I like this one. I'm going to click on it. And it automatically inserts in there for me.

Angel Marie [00:27:51]:
Now I can change out the border color to maybe better match the subscribe button. If you have branded colors, you can also put this copy and paste it easily in here. A lot of awesome, great, amazing things for you to do. Now, we've designed this landing page. Let's say I want to connect my free gift with this landing page. You can also do that as well. I'm just going to go to this mail icon. I'm going to go to download, choose a file, and I am going to upload my webinar checklist right in here.

Angel Marie [00:28:24]:
This means that as soon as somebody puts in their email address, they will automatically get this webinar checklist in their email because I've already connected the two together. I mean, it's awesome. I love how beautifully this works. Now in that case, you can also include a URL. By the way, if you don't have a download. Or maybe this landing page is wanting people to get to your blog post. You can include a URL to your blog so that it redirects them to that actual blog. So up here, go to edit email contents.

Angel Marie [00:28:55]:
After you've incorporated your incentive, that free gift that redirect, go to edit email contents and it's automatically going to have a confirm your subscription, but you can change this out. So up here, my subject line would be Webinar Checklist. Again, this is the incentive email that people are going to be getting in their inboxes, okay? And then confirm your subscription. This would then change also to Webinar Checklist because the minute they click on this blue button, they're going to be prompted to download the actual checklist in ConvertKit. It automatically connects for you and then you can customize the email messaging here. Thank you for signing up for Blank. I appreciate you, whatever it is that you're wanting to say. And then you can sign off.

Angel Marie [00:29:38]:
It's good to have you. Thanks again. And then put your name at the bottom. Now this auto saves. So you'll just go ahead and exit out of there and then you'll click save. Now our landing page is good to go, right? We've designed the landing page to start sharing everywhere. And I'm going to show you how you can share this landing page to build your email list right away from scratch when I head back to my slides in a little bit. But now that we've created this landing page, we can also connect it with the thank you page, which is also awesome in a ConvertKit free account.

Angel Marie [00:30:15]:
So for example, I'm just going to head over to this, add a thank you page. And this allows me to have another page to move my audience members further down a funnel. So let's say somebody sees my landing page and they put in their email address on it. Once they put in their email address, they'll be redirected to the thank you page. And this is where I could share even more of my content. So up here, I could say something like, I appreciate you. And then down here it says, thank you for signing up. You can keep that.

Angel Marie [00:30:48]:
You can add in your own customization, and then you can even add in some more details. So maybe I want to add in a blog post link. Maybe in this landing page, they're getting the webinar checklist right? But the thank you page, I also want to promote my blog post. I can do that just to move them further down the funnel. In that case, I'll just highlight it. I'll click this link button, and I can add in the URL of my blog post. I even can add in an image of that blog post. Maybe you have an image of it somewhere, or an image of your website.

Angel Marie [00:31:21]:
You can add that in here too, just to make it more personable. Again, this is perfect to move them down the funnel, which is awesome, and to share more of your content. Now, to make sure that your audience actually sees this thank you page, head back over to Webinar Checklist, go to Settings and make sure that it says redirect to a thank you page. You want to make sure that that's clicked. Once it is, they will automatically be getting this. All right, now I'm just going to go over here to save. I'm going to go to Share. I'm going to copy, head back in a different tab.

Angel Marie [00:31:55]:
I'm going to paste, and it automatically is live. That quick, that easy. It is good and ready to go. You can start collecting email addresses right away. And then of course, people are going to start getting your content. They're going to get that incentive email that you connected, and they're going to get that thank you page after they put in their email address. And I recommend testing this too. So once you have your landing page, just put in your own email address and make sure it redirects to the thank you page.

Angel Marie [00:32:23]:
And then make sure you get that incentive email so you make sure from an audience's perspective, it's all working really well for you. So that's how you would design that actual landing page, that you can actually start building your email list right here, right now. Even with no tech experience, you can definitely start doing that now. Another great thing that I would love to share is the ability to unlock the subscriber feature and the broadcast feature. This allows you to send emails in addition to the incentive email allows you to send emails to your subscribers. All you're going to do is go to the drop down menu, head to referrals, and you can automatically refer people to also sign up for a ConvertKit Free account. Once they sign up for a ConvertKit Free account, both you and the person you referred are going to unlock the subscriber and the broadcast feature. Now, each person you refer, you're going to be able to unlock 100 subscribers to Manage, meaning you can email up to 100 subscribers and manage and track them inside of your account.

Angel Marie [00:33:32]:
If you want to manage 200 subscribers as your list continues to grow, you will then have to refer more friends so that you can gain another 100 and then another friend so you can gain another 100. Or you can even upgrade your account too to have all of these features unlocked. But this is just me showing you exactly how you can do all of this completely for free. Another great thing that you'll have access to when it comes to growing your audience and your email list inside of ConvertKit, you can head to this question mark, click on Join the Community, and you will be redirected to our community base. This is a beautiful place to interact, engage, and connect with other creators and bloggers just like you. This is a perfect place to collaborate with people. You can ask a question, you can get help. You can even join specific groups so that you can follow along with any of these groups that you might be interested in.

Angel Marie [00:34:29]:
And then you can even follow certain topics and gain the resources that you are wanting to with these. I mean, there's so many resources, a lot of engagement, a lot of collaborations that go on inside of this community base that I would love for you all as a blogger, as a creator, to just have complete access to. And again, this comes with your ConvertKit free account. When building your list, having that thank you page, unlocking certain features, and you can be a part of the community, I just wanted to show you that really quick as a way for you to start building your email list right away. Even if you have no tech experience or even if you don't have the money to pay for an email service provider yet, you definitely can still build your email list right here, right now, absolutely for free. Okay, so number one was to create that landing page. Number two, once you have that landing page created, is to share it everywhere on your website so you have the landing page. Now I want to talk about how you can share it so that you can grow your email list even further.

Angel Marie [00:35:35]:
So when I say share it everywhere on your website, you literally should share it everywhere. So put it on the announcement bar, meaning you would have the announcement bar pop up on your website, letting people know, hey, join this. The minute they click on that button, they'll be prompted to put in their name and email address so that you can then gain another subscriber. And this is something that you can also do inside of ConvertKit. You could also do put it on the about page. So on your about page, on your website towards the bottom where it says, so let's begin your beauty in the making, which is my side hustle business's name. Just to share an example, the minute you click on that link, it redirects for them to put in their name and email address on my landing page so that I'm sharing it. I'm getting more people to sign up.

Angel Marie [00:36:21]:
And then of course, you can have it as a pop up. A pop up means that when the computer can tell when somebody is navigating away from your website so they're going to go somewhere else in a different URL and exit away from there. This automatically pops up as a last minute reminder. Hey, before you go, receive free gifts, self help guides and weekly motivations sent to your inbox. Right? This is perfect just to give that last reminder to let people know, hey, sign up here so that you can be a part of my email list. Also, a menu link is a great idea. So let's say your landing page was about a free workbook or a free checklist or a free gift. You can add that into your menu link on your actual website so that people can see the word oh free.

Angel Marie [00:37:09]:
They'll click on it and they'll be redirected to your landing page so that they can actually sign up for it and therefore you get an additional subscriber on that email list of yours. You can also put it on your blog posts as well. So when I say that every time you create a blog post towards the bottom, you should always have somewhere where someone can sign up to join your email list. This means that they are letting you into their virtual world. You can now email them. You now have a group of people to speak to on a regular basis about new content that you have and to sell to when you have something ready to sell. It's a great, great, amazing strategy to build a group of people that are your superfans and are your future buyers. Number three is to share on social media.

Angel Marie [00:38:01]:
So you're going to want to share on Instagram or your Twitter bio. Of course. Now that link that I had showed you in the demo where you had shared that link and we had pasted it in a different tab, you can take that same link and put it in your Instagram bio. Now if you don't want it to say all of these words up at the top, if you want it to be a little bit different, you can use things like bitly.com to change out the URL. That's super easy as well, so that people can automatically click on this in your social media BIOS and be redirected to your landing page so that they can sign up to be a part of your email list. And this is an example of mine that I just wanted to show you as you can see, I switched out that link for the Bitly link towards the bottom where it says Bitly. Your beauty in the making. Once people click on that, they'll be redirected to where they can sign up for my landing page.

Angel Marie [00:38:56]:
And then there's also a Facebook page. If you have a Facebook page, I highly recommend putting that on your Facebook business page. If you don't have one, you can definitely create one for free and you would just put that and connect it to the sign up button so the minute people click sign up, they'll be redirected to that landing page in that same way so that you can start collecting email addresses as well. And then there's a YouTube description. If you are a YouTuber or are an aspiring YouTuber and want to make videos, you can definitely put in your landing page link towards the bottom of every video in the caption section. So keep in mind in this video, matt here as an example, isn't just saying, hey, download your ten blocks PDF here where you can see that in the middle. When people click on that link, they're not going to be redirected right away to get the ten Blocks PDF. Instead, they're going to be redirected to Matt's landing page so that they can input their email address first.

Angel Marie [00:39:58]:
That's the most important thing, so that it's a win win situation. You get their email address and in return they get the ten Blocks PDF. Also a pinterest. Pin pinterest is amazing and I highly recommend using it. Beyond looking for recipes or do it yourself projects, it is beautiful for sharing your content too, and getting more clicks, getting more people to sign up as well. So you can use something like Canva.com to create these digital flyers, just as you see on the examples here. Once you create those digital flyers, you'll pin it in Pinterest and more people will click on it. You can promote it on Pinterest.

Angel Marie [00:40:40]:
Once people click on it, they'll be redirected to where they can sign up to receive whatever it is that you had placed on your landing page content so that you can get yet another subscriber. Just a great way to grow everywhere on social media, including things like Pinterest, which I highly, highly recommend. Just a side note, I had recently used Pinterest and put out a goal setting workbook and I promoted it on Pinterest. I got 30 subscribers from it right off the bat, just by doing it and promoting it on Pinterest. I highly recommend looking into that and doing that same thing because it can bring you a lot of success when it comes to growing an email list of those superfans and future customers. And then you can also go live. I highly recommend going live so when you go live on social media, I know it may sound or feel a bit weird to hold up your phone and just talk to your phone live. But I promise you, the more comfortable you get with it, the more fun it becomes.

Angel Marie [00:41:41]:
Because you're talking with people when you're live, it's more personable. They can see you, they hear your voice, they hear what it is that you have to say. So you can go live and you can talk about your content. You can talk about your landing page and you can say, hey, I have this landing page, or I have this content talking about this, or I have this free gift to give away. To get that, go to the link in my bio so that you can check it out. Definitely recommend going live for sure. Number four, the fourth way to share your landing page so that you can grow your list even further is to do a one to one. Now, a one to one is anything from a text, sending an email, going on Twitter, or a direct message.

Angel Marie [00:42:24]:
This is where you are speaking one to one between you and another person to let them know about your landing page so that they can then become a subscriber. So, for example, this could be a prompt or a model for how you would text somebody. Hi, I just started a new blank for blank and I would love to have you and then include that landing page link. I did this when I first started my email list as well, and I sent this text to a lot of my friends and family, and I was able to get quite a few right off the bat because I took the time to do a one to one. So I definitely recommend doing that so that you can also grow your email list in that way. Number five is to be a guest. When you are a guest, you are collaborating with another creator or another blogger. So maybe you're doing a feature.

Angel Marie [00:43:17]:
Maybe you are a guest on their podcast or their webinar. When you are a guest, you are connecting with someone else's audience and therefore sharing your content, sharing your free gift, letting people know where they can get more. And here's an example of that. And yes, share your content with someone else's audience. Sorry, I got way too ahead of myself. But yes, share your content with someone else's audience. See, that's what happens when you get so excited teaching people about email marketing and how they can become more successful within their actual business. Now, this is an example by Ali Kazazaza.

Angel Marie [00:43:50]:
She was a guest on the Balanced Life blog post, and she had wrote about the purposeful housewife. Now, towards the bottom of this blog post, mind you, this is a guest blog post on somebody else's website. Towards the bottom, she had linked in her landing page to where they can get a free starter kit. Once people clicked on that link, they were redirected to Allie's landing page. They could put in their name and their email address and in return, they got the minimalism starter kit that Allie had promised them. Now, Allie literally said, I looked in PayPal and I had $25,000 in my account. Crazy, but so amazing. And this happened because Allie gave away that free gift, right? People gave her their email address.

Angel Marie [00:44:40]:
They got that free gift. Once they got her minimalism starter kit, that PDF, there was a call to action on the bottom of that PDF where they could buy her actual product or service. A lot of people bought it, and that is why she woke up to $25,000 in her account, which is amazing and beautiful and can happen for so many creators worldwide, because they took the time to implement these strategies to share their landing page everywhere, including being a guest as much as they possibly could. All right, we went over so much, right? We went over how to start your email list from scratch. You know how valuable it is since we've went over it and talked about it. It is everything when it comes to the growth of your business. And I highly recommend just diving deep into those strategies. And we also talked about sharing, right, sharing your landing page so that you can actually grow your email list from scratch.

Angel Marie [00:45:36]:
So I want you to think to yourself a little bit, what are you excited to do next? What are you excited to do right at this very moment after this workshop? Whatever it is that it was that you're excited to do, I encourage you to do it this week. I encourage you to start planning, to start taking those steps to get that done, because I know that you can. You are very much capable of doing so, and I highly encourage you to start implementing it so that you can take on these email marketing strategies and therefore grow your overall business. Now, in order to help you out with whatever it is that you're excited to do next, we are going to be giving you a bonus gift, as I mentioned earlier, just for watching this workshop and for being a part of the Blogger Breakthrough Summit. Now you can get this free gift of the free plan of ConvertKit. Again, no obligations. This is just a free way for you to build your email list right off the bat. And we're also going to be gifting you with 100 subscribers to manage right away.

Angel Marie [00:46:34]:
Now. This means that you do not have to refer a friend as I demoed earlier. You don't have to refer a friend to unlock the automations and the subscriber feature I'm sorry? To unlock the subscriber feature and the broadcast feature that will already be unlocked for you for up to 100 subscribers. Meaning you can see 100 subscribers and you can send emails to up to 100 subscribers right away without needing to refer any friends whatsoever. So this is something that we're going to be gifting to you. Again, just for being a part of the Blogger Breakthrough Summit. Take advantage of it, dive into it, grow your email list and see the value and the success that it brings your business. Now, when you go to Convercate Combsummit, you'll be prompted to just go through a few questions, letting them know if you're brand new or if you're coming from a different email service provider.

Angel Marie [00:47:30]:
And then, of course, you're going to put in your email address and a password. Remember your password that you put in here, okay? Because I want you to sign in not only today, but the next day and the next day and the day after that. I want you to constantly use this because I care about the fact that you are going to grow your email list. You are going to build your audience in the best way possible. So definitely remember that password. And then, of course, to unlock even more subscribers in your account, let's say you grow your email list to 101 to unlock your account to where you are able to send emails to all of those people, not just 100 of them. You're just going to click on referrals and you can refer your friends. You can absolutely refer your friends to sign up for free.

Angel Marie [00:48:21]:
Once they sign up for a free account, you will then unlock another 100 subscribers. Or you do have the ability to upgrade your account by going to that Bluish Upgrade button right in the top right hand corner, so that you can unlock all of that by upgrading multiple options for you, for sure. And then don't forget about the community. Engage, interact, meet with so many creators like yourself. And this can refer back to our point of being a guest, right? How far, how much value being a guest can be when sharing your content with someone else's audience and growing your email list with someone else's audience. So I encourage you to find someone in this community that you can collaborate with, that you can be a guest with, that you can really just join these groups and topics and learn more so that you can take your email marketing strategies to that very next level. And I wanted to share this quote by Jessica really quick. She had said, I built this business on a community of creators from a space of generosity.

Angel Marie [00:49:21]:
It turns out even strangers will support you and spread your message like wildfire when you show up with your whole heart and a plan to truly serve. The real power isn't in the number of followers or email lists that you have. It's in the quality of the relationships that you have. I love that because it is so, so true. So join a community. Be generous, support. People will show up for you. They will love your work.

Angel Marie [00:49:47]:
They will absolutely love your stuff, and they'll be grateful that you took the time to serve them, to give them your content. All of that great, amazing stuff. And then, of course, if you have any questions about anything at all within your ConvertKit free account or in regards to email marketing, you could just head to that email or that message icon right in the bottom right hand corner and you can start a conversation with anybody from our support team. They will be there right with you. They will help you out in any way possible. Definitely recommend going to them for any help at all because we are here for you, supporting you and believing you all the way and giving you the resources that you need to set yourself up for success. Last but not least, thank you. I really appreciate you taking the time to be a part of the Blogger Breakthrough Summit and to watch this webinar.

Angel Marie [00:50:36]:
This was so much fun to be able to teach you guys how to start your email list and how to build your email list absolutely from scratch. Thank you guys so much and we look forward to seeing you, hopefully next time inside of ConvertKit. All right, angel, thank you so much for that information. That was super helpful. I definitely wish I had it when I started. Yes, of course. No, it was so much fun just to be here and to talk through how to start and grow your email list from scratch. I just hope that you guys found it valuable and I hope that you'll take what it is that I've taught you and start implementing them into your very own businesses.

Angel Marie [00:51:09]:
Take advantage of this amazing offer from Convert to angel, thank you so much for doing this on it. I appreciate it. Yeah, of course. Thank you.

**Transcript:**
[00:00:09.940] - Anna Crosby
Welcome to How to Write Great Emails (Even if You're Not a Writer). I am so glad that you're here because email marketing is a great skill to learn for your business, since email marketing is not going anywhere. You might as well learn how to make the most of it and make it work for your business. Before we get into it, let me just briefly introduce myself. My name is Anna Crosby, and I run Geni Collective, which is an email marketing consulting company. I love email marketing, obviously, since I'm giving a presentation on email marketing, and I also love the technology that comes and is available with email marketing and automation. I have been in business since 2013 and exclusively online since 2015, so it did not take me very long to realize that having an online business fit my life and my personality better than having an in-person business. Fun fact, my very first business was selling handmade jewelry. I am also a social media avoider. I avoid using social media. I don't use it in my personal life or for my business. I've built my business entirely relying on email marketing. I do this every day and this is the way that I communicate with my audience, and I should say the only way that I communicate with my audience, outside of obviously doing these talks and other collaborations and outreach.

[00:01:43.200] - Anna
I am also a very introverted person. I love having time to myself and recharge. I mention this because email marketing for me is uniquely suited to introverted traits. If you are also an introvert and you struggle with knowing what to say or struggle with showing up, then I'm going to have some tips in here for you, as well. Lastly, I am also a max level nerd because I have a PhD in Cognitive Psychology and Neuroscience. I've spent the better part of a decade learning everything that I can about the brain and how it works. Combining this with learning about marketing later on in life just seemed like the perfect pairing for me to go into business. So that's it about me. Let's talk about you. You are here, probably, I'm assuming, because you want to write good emails. And more importantly than that, you want to write emails that make you sales, that make you money, right? But more than that, you want to feel proud of your emails. You want to look at an email that you wrote and say, ""Oh, gosh, that's a great email."" You want to feel proud of the emails that you put out there.

[00:02:59.260] - Anna
And maybe you've also sent emails before just because everybody says you should be doing email marketing, you should be sending emails. So you've probably sent emails just to send an email with no strategy or higher purpose than that email whatsoever. If that's you, absolutely no judgment because we've all been there. And you're also probably here because you're not a copywriter or you don't consider yourself any, really, kind of writer. That's very common for the clients that I work with. They come to me and they say, ""Well, I just don't know what to write. I'm not a writer. I've never written anything. I'm not interested in writing a novel in email form."" So if that's you, you are in the right place. And optionally, you are a bit on the introverted side and you just generally find it hard to show up, especially with emails. It's optional. You don't absolutely don't have to be an introvert to get the most out of this talk. But if you are, then it is a bonus. Here's what we're going to cover, really simple. I'm going to tell you about seven things that you should consider when you're writing your emails, to take your emails from like, ""Ah, at least I sent an email"", to ""Wow, that email I wrote was really great.""

[00:04:24.170] - Anna
All right, so we are going to go ahead and dive straight into the first one. And I want to get this out of the way because I know as business owners, we want everything to be perfect. We want everything to be professional and polished and all of those things. And that's the first thing we're going to have to let go of when you are doing email marketing. Email marketing is a marathon, not a sprint. Each individual email will build on your strategy. But each email, if you have a tech mishap or a typo or something like that, it's not going to break it. Again, a lot of my clients worry about these things, right? And maybe you are worried about them too. You're worried about making typos or spelling errors. You're worried that your emails are too long or too rambly, or tech mishaps like forgetting to put the variable that inserted somebody's name in the email. It just has ""Hello, first name,"" and it doesn't actually put it in there. Stuff like that. This is what everybody is worried about. If you were worried about these, don't worry, it's completely normal.

[00:05:32.280] - Anna
But you know what? Your subscribers don't care about these things. That's the good news about it. What do subscribers care about? They care about connecting with real people. They care about communicating informally. Email is an informal way of communication. It's not like you're writing a book. You're writing emails. We write emails to friends. Well, maybe less so nowadays. Nowadays, we just write them text messages and instant messages. But email is an informal method of communication. People are also interested in being friends with people on the internet. If somebody is following you, you want to make them feel like you are a friend to them. You're not somebody who is an unreachable celebrity, and email really facilitates that. I want to say that don't let this perfectionism or wanting to make your emails super polished, super professional. Don't let it stop you from reaching your people right now, because your people need you and they need to hear what you have to say. So let's just get it out of the way, let go of all of the perfectionism, and let's reach the people right now.

[00:06:47.120] - Anna
The second tip that I have for you is to know the purpose of every single email that you send. There are some emails that are focused more on education. There are some emails that are focused more on getting engagement. There are some that are focused on sending you to a sales page so you can make a purchase. The purpose of each email is unique. You might say, ""Well, duh."" When you are sending one-off emails like your weekly newsletter or your regular campaigns, you might think, well, that makes total sense. But it also makes total sense when you are looking at emails in a series such as a welcome sequence or a sales sequence. The way that I teach how to write welcome sequences, which I'll tell you more about at the end of the presentation about how you can get that for free, in the way that I teach, I teach to write six emails, and each one of those six emails has a specific purpose.

[00:07:47.030] - Anna
Like I said, some emails are focused on getting engagement. Some emails are focused on building connections. Some emails are focused on going to a page to decide to make a purchase. The same is true of a sales sequence as well. Not every single email is focused on... Well, obviously, the call to action is always to go to the page to make a purchase, but the purpose of each email is different. For example, you might have a sales email that talks about why they want to get the item that you're selling. You also can have emails that share testimonial or other success stories that make the customer or potential customer, imagine what it's like to own that product. When you know what the purpose is of every single email that you are writing, it makes it that much easier to write this email. Not to mention that when you know what the purpose is, it makes every single email that you send, whether it's standalone or in a sequence, have a strategic purpose to them.

[00:08:56.850] - Anna
Tip number three, you want to share your story and let your subscribers get to know you. Of course, email marketing is still marketing, so you need to talk about your products, you need to talk about your services and the successes that your clients are getting, all of those things that we normally think about when email marketing, but you also need to talk about yourself beyond what you can do for them. This is the reason why I shared a little bit about myself in the introduction. I let you know my background and where I was coming from so that you can put everything that I'm telling you about email marketing into practice. For example, I don't use any social media. I built my business only using email marketing. That tells you that when I talk about email marketing, I talk about it in that standalone way where it's not dependent on another system like a social media profile in order to work. So you know that about me. And if you join my email newsletter, you'll hear talk about all other kinds of personal things that have absolutely nothing to do with email marketing. I do that so that I can share more about where I'm coming from in my experience so that we can make a connection together. Because here's the thing. People can buy what you are selling, the same thing that you're selling almost anywhere on the internet. The internet is a huge place, and there's lots of people doing the same thing that you are. However, you want to distinguish yourself. Why would people want to buy that thing specifically from you?

[00:10:33.970] - Anna
That is because people buy things from people that they like. In order to infuse some of that likability factor, you need to also talk about yourself and your story and your experience in the emails that matters a lot. All right, next thing. Then I'm going to talk about promotion and promoting with integrity. What does that actually mean to be authentic in your promotion? You hear that word a lot. Everybody talks about being authentic. It is the most important thing to be authentic when you are actually promoting something, especially if it's an affiliate product or a software that you want to make an affiliate commission on. My biggest advice is to always promote the tools and resources that you have actually used, or tried to use, or test it out yourself. That is the biggest thing for when it comes to promoting something with authenticity. I know that nowadays, bundles are the big, huge thing, and everybody is running a bundle and everybody is contributing to bundles. I think it is just a fantastic way. It's a win-win for everybody involved. This issue of authentic promotion comes up probably more than you would think because not all bundles are created equal. Not all bundles have the value that you would expect, and sometimes that leads to a sticky situation when you are trying to promote.

[00:12:09.140] - Anna
My best advice on how to get around these issues is to really focus on what you know is good value and be honest about what is not. That doesn't mean that you have to say, ""Well, this bundle is not very good value, but you should check it out anyway."" Focus on what you know is a good value. You know your products are in there. Instead of talking about all the hundreds of resources and the worth is such, and such, and such, focus on promoting your product in the bundle because you know that even if they don't get anything else from the bundle, they're still getting a great deal by getting your products. That is one way to deal with that, while staying in integrity, sometimes it may mean that you have to back out or not participate in a promotion if you see that you cannot promote it in authenticity. But one thing that I will say is that your audience will learn about your values and how you do business based on how you handle situations like these.So focus on what you know is great value. If it's something that is actually going to be helpful to your audience, focus on that.

[00:13:28.810] - Anna
The next tip is to give them choice. And by them, I mean your email subscribers. And that is, and I know this is a little bit of a controversial and emotionally-charged topic, you want to make it easy for people to opt out of certain emails, and you want to make it easy for them to unsubscribe. And here's why. Email marketing, when it is done right, is a pull marketing, not a push marketing. So the difference between them, a pull marketing is when you are organically attracting people to read the stuff that you write and to see your promotion and to go get your offers. Push marketing is what you see normally on social media with advertisements where advertisements will pop up into your feed, whether you've asked for them or not, usually not. You want your email marketing to be pull marketing. You want people to want to read your emails. You do not want to push your emails onto people. That's why a big aspect of email marketing is getting consent in the first place to join an email list.

[00:14:36.410] - Anna
That's really very important with GDPR and Can-Spam laws. You want to make sure that people are actually opting in to hear about your stuff. That consent, I don't feel like it's a blanket consent for everything. If you are running a promotion and you're emailing them every day for a week and a half, you might want to give them the option to opt out of hearing about that specific promotion or even one of your regular content. So if you have a blog post and a video and a podcast and you are sending separate emails promoting each one of those, maybe you can let people opt out of, for example, if people don't listen to podcasts or if people are not interested in watching your videos, if they just want to read the blog post, make them, or give them, rather, the option of telling you what they want to hear about the most. Here's the thing. When I say this, inevitably somebody is thinking, Well, if they don't want to hear about it, they can just delete the email and move on. Maybe that's what you're thinking about right now too. Why should I go the extra mile to create all the system for people opting out and telling me their preferences if they can just delete the emails that they're not interested in?

[00:15:59.470] - Anna
Well, here's the thing. You don't want to train your subscribers to delete your emails, which is essentially what you are doing when you are giving them everything and anything under the sun that you have and they're only interested in a small part of it. They'll, for example, if you're running a promotion and they're not interested in the promotion, they're going to be deleting your emails that whole week that your promotion is going on. You don't want them to delete your emails. Not only is it bad for your deliverability long term, but it's also letting them know that when they see your name in their inbox, ""Oh, this is about the membership that I don't care about,"" and they'll just delete the email after the promotion is over, they might still have that gut reaction to delete your emails because they think it is promotion related. So don't train people to delete your emails. The other thing too is to make unsubscribing easy. A lot of people feel weird about unsubscribing because they think that you'll know that they unsubscribe and they don't want to hurt your feelings or just goes to their promotions folder and they're not interested in reading it, so they just leave it there and it goes there to die a slow death.

[00:17:13.670] - Anna
Whatever the case is, make unsubscribing easy because the people who are not interested in getting your emails after a certain point will never become your customers. Why should you be paying for them in your email marketing software? Why should you be spending all this effort and sending them the emails? Why should you have your open rates suffer and your click rates suffer just because somebody's just not interested in it and they just feel bad for unsubscribing? Make it super easy. Tell them in the first email that you send to them, ""Hey, you're going to be hearing about such, and such, and such. If you're not interested in this, click here to unsubscribe or scroll to the bottom and unsubscribe. No hard feelings, no questions asked."" I feel like you would think, well, people would know that, but saying it explicitly makes it easier for them to do it if that's what they want to do. Again, don't train your subscribers to delete your emails. Instead, give them the choice and respect their inbox.

[00:18:14.800] - Anna
All right, next, we're going to talk about relevancy. For those people who don't want to unsubscribe or opt out, they want to get your emails and they want to hear from you, there's one thing that you need to think about for those people, and that is personalization, making sure that the emails are relevant to them. It's not just me saying this. A 2021 survey done by McKinsey and company found that 71% of customers expect personalization, and 76% of customers are frustrated when they don't get this personalization. And just in case you're wondering, this goes way beyond just putting their first name in the email, that is a form of personalization, but more than that, it's sending emails that are relevant to what that person is interested in. And you can know what they are interested in by the previous products that they purchased from you, where they signed up, what incentive did they sign up for? All of those things are clues about what they are interested in and what their next steps are. Customers actually expect to be engaged and onboarded when they first make a purchase. That was a specific question that they asked on this survey, and the vast majority of customers said that they do expect this engagement and onboarding.

[00:19:42.960] - Anna
What's the takeaway here? You want to regularly ask for your subscribers' preferences, and solicit feedback, and then write to them based on what they said they were interested in. This is really easy to do with your freebie when you're structuring your welcome sequence, which I'll tell you about at the end of the presentation. But you can talk directly to what they are interested in because you know what they're interested in. They just got this freebie on this topic. It's especially relevant if you have multiple freebies and multiple ways that people can come into your email list, those onboarding sequences make the biggest difference. So do not skip on those engagement and onboarding sequences when somebody first joins your list.

[00:20:29.920] - Anna
Here we are, we are focusing on value next. This is the next tip: What is in it for them? This is not to say anything bad about anybody. We are all humans and our brains work in exactly the same way. When we are looking at our email, we are looking for something interesting, something to give us a dopamine hit, something to entertain us. Whenever we are looking at the subject lines inside of our email inbox, we are asking ourselves the question, ""What's in it for me? What am I going to get out of this?"" If it's not immediately apparent what I'm going to get out of this, I'm going to be less likely to click and open that email because I just don't know what to expect.

[00:21:16.360] - Anna
When you are writing not just your subject lines, but your emails in general, you need to answer these questions. Why should your subscribers care about everything that you're saying in this email? How will what you are saying or what you are offering help them? Why should they do what you want them to do? If you want them to click to go to the sales page, why should they do that? You want to really spell it out for them. You want to say, ""Hey, you want to get my welcome sequence because it's the most important email sequence that you ever write and all of your subscribers are going to get it?"" It's really important that you get this right. You need to get my welcome sequence templates, which I will tell you about in a minute. But you want to make sure that you are explicitly telling them the value. Why should they care about this? When you are writing each and every single email, this is what I want you to focus on. Because the word value is generally associated with free content, I want to let you know that selling something is providing value too, because paid products are going to always be better than free products. Your paid products, you've spent a lot of time thinking about the solution and thinking about how to organize it and thinking about making it a complete solution, not just a piece of it that you give away for free, but a complete solution. So when you are selling an offer, you are really providing value to your subscribers.

[00:22:49.270] - Anna
So, here we are at the end of them. Probably should have numbered them in this presentation so I could keep track. But that focus on value, if you don't get anything else out of this presentation, I hope that you at least remember when you are writing each and every single email to make it really explicit why somebody should care about this email. Somebody who's not you, right? Why should somebody on your email list care about what you're writing about? These are all of the tips that we talked about. We let go of our perfectionism. We know the purpose of each and every single email that we write, even when they're in a series. We know that we need to share our stories and our personal experiences to give context to what we're talking about. We always need to promote with integrity whatever the form of that takes, whether it's using the product ourselves and focusing on what we know is good value to pulling out of promotions where we do not feel we can promote them with integrity. We want to give them a choice, a choice to stay on our email list or a choice to get or not get certain types of emails, and we want to make it relevant and ""Why should they care?"" That is, in a nutshell, what the seven tips. If you keep these in mind when you're writing your next email, I think it will really help you to write a better email than just the generic, ""Hey, I made this thing. It costs this much. Click here to get it."" This will make you a better email writer and you do not have to be a copywriter for this. If you notice in my introduction, I did not say I was any copywriter and I am not a copywriter. However, I write good emails, and this is why I share how you can write good emails as well.

[00:24:49.670] - Anna
I promised that I would tell you how you can get my welcome sequence templates for free. Here is how you can get these for free: By joining my Geni Insiders email newsletter community. What a surprise, my community is an email newsletter, right? I'm very, very focused on providing the best value that I can to this community. Other than getting this welcome sequence and a couple of other bonus surprise resources that you'll get when you subscribe. I also host free events, action weeks, and extra support weeks. I host workshops for free for my community, and I don't promote these anywhere else, so if you are interested in learning more about email marketing, I highly suggest that you join my email newsletter. I would love to see you there.

[00:25:41.640] - Anna
And also, if you get the Speaker bonus bundle for the summit, you'll also get my training on how to use email to monetize your blog. Obviously, this is a summit all about blogging. I have made this resource and a playbook that goes with it. It's an interactive workbook that you can work through and really get clear on the steps that you need to do in order to make your blog make you money. This is a training that I normally sell for $79, but it is free if you get the VIP upgrade to the bundle. And of course, you can go to my website at genicollective.com, you can see everything that I offer, including my mini courses, my other templates. I have templates for a lot of different email situations, so you can look through those and see what you need. I also have mini trainings as well as full-blown courses on different aspects of email marketing.

[00:26:36.900] - Anna
Of course, I love email, and I would love to keep in touch with you by email. If you have any questions about anything that I said in this presentation, or if you just want to connect and say hi, feel free to send me an email at anna@genicollective.com. All right, I hope that this has been useful to you, and I look forward to speaking with you soon. Take care.

**Transcript:**
[00:00:10.240] - Caroline Vencil, bloggingonpoint.com
Hi, guys.

[00:00:11.460] - Tracy Lynn, bloggingonpoint.com
Hey!

[00:00:12.040] - Caroline
Hello, hello and welcome to our presentation of Plant Your Flag. I am Caroline Vencil.

[00:00:19.210] - Tracy
And I am Tracy Lynne.

[00:00:20.950] - Caroline
And together we make up the blogging mentorship group Blogging on Point. And we are super, super passionate about helping amazing people who want to make more money from their blogs and from their online businesses. So, we're super excited to share this presentation with you guys today because planting your flag was the thing that for Tracy and I was was really the game changer of of moving our businesses forward and being able to have fun with it, because that's our big thing, is having fun.

[00:00:49.840] - Tracy
Always have fun.

[00:00:51.370] - Caroline
All right. So today you are going to get ready for some homework because that's what we do. We don't believe in just kind of throwing information at you. You need to make it actionable. So, get ready with a notepad and a pen. You're going to absolutely love taking some some little mini homework assignments. And we're going to help you attract your perfect people, repel the rest and create an email list of super fans. So, let's get started. Okay, our goal for this presentation, we want you to be able to find your flag in your niche, plant it and call your people to it; that's our goal here, guys. What is this presentation without us sharing our flag with you guys that you understand, like, what is this flag that you are talking about? So, here's our flag. We're going to be totally honest. We've already explained that we are brutally honest and real with you guys. We are all in this to make money. This is not a hobby. It is a business. And it is okay to say it. Making money from your business is not wrong. It's not immoral. It's not shady. There's nothing wrong with it at all. That's what we believe now.

[00:02:04.990] - Tracy
I want to say something because that's super, super important that you make that mind- mind shift from a blogger to online business owner. And once you do that, it takes the shady out of it, don't you think? It makes it more- it's a big business. This is what I do. There's nothing wrong with making money with my business.

[00:02:25.000] - Caroline
Yes.

[00:02:25.450] - Tracy
So, that's an important point to make as well.

[00:02:27.580] - Caroline
Absolutely. And we hope that you understand that this isn't we're not going to be dealing in snake oil sales here. We're not going to be saying anything that's going to be icky or used car sales-many. These are all things that are going to help you feel connected with your business and with your readers.

[00:02:44.770] - Tracy
Absolutely.

[00:02:47.400] - Caroline
So, let's dive right in with limiting beliefs, because once we say things like we believe that you should be able to make money from your blog, from your business, all of these negative things come up in our minds. I don't know about you, but for both of us, it was a lot of like, ""Oh, no, that can't be right."" ""It's icky."" ""It's gross. ""The only way to make money for my blog is going to be with ads."" ""I would never sell anything. Email is just never worked for me.' ""I have a lot of people on my list, but I guess I suck at selling because nobody ever buys for me.""

[00:03:25.190] - Tracy
Don't you think that is the most common thing, though, is people don't buy. So, if they don't buy the first time, we tell ourselves they're never going to buy.

[00:03:35.280] - Caroline
""I must be doing something wrong."" ""I must suck at what I'm doing because nobody bought from me then and then you never sell again."" Right? Like you've been burned the first time you've ever tried to sell something and then you never do it again. That's not all we want to have happen. Those are all limiting beliefs that we have. I know that you're probably also saying, ""I've already heard it all before."" ""I know emails important, but I guess it's still not working because nobody's buying from me."" Or, ""I have people on my list, but nobody opens it."" Or my ultimate favorite limiting belief that I have said this to myself, ""I can't sell."" ""I can't sell.""

[00:04:14.940] - Tracy
I think we've all said that to ourselves, though.

[00:04:17.540] - Caroline
Right?

[00:04:18.390] - Tracy
Yes.

[00:04:18.510] - Caroline
And it's just a limiting belief, guys. So, yeah, we want to break that out, because the truth is, you're already selling to your list. You're already selling to your people without ever realizing it because what you're selling is you.

[00:04:35.820] - Tracy
I think that right there is a game changer. When I heard that, you know what you're already selling, you're selling yourself, I'm like, ""Oh, my gosh, that's exactly right."" And when you hear those words, it changes everything. It takes from hard to I'm already doing this.

[00:04:53.040] - Caroline
Yeah.

[00:04:53.520] - Tracy
I'm already doing this every single day in my blog post, in my newsletters and my social media post. I'm already doing this.

[00:05:00.360] - Caroline
Yeah, because here's the thing, though. It's not just enough to say, like I'm subscribed to Tracey Lynn, I'm subscribed to Carolyn Vencil. Are you being real with your people? Are you actually showing up as you- not Miss Pinterest perfect. Not the Step third wives version. Not the watered down version where you're afraid to say things like, I don't know. Stinky, stinky face, not the one- not the version of yourself where you're trying to be someone that you're not.

[00:05:37.220] - Tracy
Right. Not following someone else's voice or their stance or their journey, that is a unique thing.

[00:05:44.050] - Caroline
Yeah.

[00:05:44.720] - Tracy
You need to what we like to call ""plant your flag"", find your voice, and don't just find your voice. You need to own it.

[00:05:54.030] - Caroline
Yep. Full, full on. We want you to stop the self-doubt of yourself, you are enough. You are enough. Your people need to and want to hear from you authentically and you need to in your job description. It needs to say, and I show up for my people, I am there for them. I am me to my people. That's what you need to be able to do.

[00:06:24.800] - Tracy
Absolutely.

[00:06:27.650] - Caroline
But wait, why is it so important to find your flag? Why is this so important? Isn't it enough to just write out an email and send it out to people or announce the sale and just send it out to your people? No, it's not enough. We have been there. We've done it. We have messed it up ethically. And you know what? It really doesn't work.

[00:06:51.350] - Tracy
Oh, it's so doesn't work. And that's one of the reasons why we're here today, is to get you unstuck and back on the right track because. Yeah, it's no fun being stuck. We know.

[00:07:03.120] - Caroline
No, absolutely. We have been there. We have struggled through it. And we want to help you out and understanding that honestly, planting your flag, staking your claim is going to be the game changer for you inside of your market and for your business.

[00:07:17.060] - Tracy
Amen.

[00:07:19.440] - Caroline
So, hi again, so that we get to know each other even better. We are Tracy and Caroline, I volunteer as tribute first all the time.

[00:07:27.240] - Tracy
All the time.

[00:07:28.440] - Caroline
Hi, guys. I'm Caroline. I am the owner of Caroline Vencil.com. I am a mom of four. I have three sons and one little baby girl. I am the wife of an amazing, hard working husband. I have been a full time blogger for more than five years now, which is crazy town to me. I full time lover of coffee kitty cuddles and making money while I sleep. I love that. I know. Right. So, here is the back story of this struggle. You seen like I lead with the fact that I'm very successful in my business. I'm very thankful for it, but nobody ever talks about like the origin story. So, I started my blog back in 2015 and I genuinely expected to make twenty thousand dollars. In my first month blogging, I published that Hello World post and crickets. I'm sitting there refreshing the page over and over and over again and I was genuinely shocked that it didn't happen. And then after it didn't happen, I was like, ""Oh, I will just do what all of these other big bloggers are doing, because if it works for them, it must work for me. And that was when I started faking my voice and I lost it. I lost who I was. I got rid of who I genuinely was at my core, which is a total spaz and a weirdo. Can you tell this is really me? If I was trying to be like, ""Good morning everyone. Hello and welcome to our webinar. This is a joyous occasion."" You'd be like, ""Oh, that's weird."" I couldn't do that forever. So, I wound up growing my list with all the wrong people because I did try to do the whole Pinterest-perfect-mom thing for way too long. And in that process of growing my list with all the wrong people, I finally found my voice. I finally found my voice and I got the okay to let my freak flag fly. And then I started to bring in the right people and that's when I planted my flag loudly. I'm allowed human. Just true story.

[00:09:20.760] - Tracy
I love that. Okay, my name is Tracy Lynn and I'm the owner of Simple Living Country Gal.com. Mom of four. GG of two. Adorable little boys, if I do say so myself.

[00:09:31.950] - Caroline
They are.

[00:09:31.950] - Tracy
I'm a full time blogger and I also love Coffee Grandbaby's. I'm kind of addicted to go shows. Yeah, I kind of make money talking about goats, which is fun and in a unique niche to have. So, here's my back story. I started blogging a year after Caroline in 2016 and I got on the chasing pages for the fast income train.

[00:09:58.010] - Caroline
Chu-chu

[00:09:58.380] - Tracy
Oh I know, right. But unfortunately those page views left and that left me standing there trying to find a different way to make money. That's when I turn to email and I got to work attracting my perfect person. Like Caroline, I found my voice because I was copying people in the beginning, too. I think that's something everybody does in the beginning because we need that permission to be our own person. So, I was emulating other people I admired in my niche and I was sounding like them, but I found my voice and that's when I started shouting it from the blogging rooftops. And then something crazy magical happened. My list went from stagnant and nonresponsive to the backbone of my business. My readers started answering questions. They started emailing me. And they started buying from me. And that means I am now in charge of my income and I'm not at the mercy of page views anymore.

[00:10:57.810] - Caroline
And can I get an amen for that?

[00:10:57.810] - Tracy
Okay, so before you plant your flag, you need to know what your flag actually is.

[00:11:09.750] - Caroline
100%. This is our favorite quote, guys. When we heard this quote the first time both of us sat there and were like, ""My mind is blown."" Love me or hate me, there's no money in the middle. And both of us- so, true story- both of us are people pleasers to an extent. We really are. We've had conversations before. We're we're like, ""Oh, what do you think?"" Oh, I don't know. What do you think? Back and forth and back and forth all the time. But at the end of the day, that's not how business needs to be. You need to take a stand, because when you have people who are following you, who understand what you have to say, who are like, ""Yes, that is my girl, she gets me. She's in my head."" I feel like you've known me my whole life. ""How did you know that's exactly what I was thinking?"" And then you're going to have people who are like, ""No, they read the first line of your first email and your first welcome sequence and they are like ""I am out of here."" The truth is, once you find that- once you find the ability to convey how you feel accurately, perfectly, that's what will bring in your perfect person.

[00:12:21.660] - Tracy
I love that you're ""perfect person""- the exact person you want on your email list. Okay, so let's talk about this. We have a process.

[00:12:32.760] - Caroline
We do.

[00:12:33.690] - Tracy
Yes. This is our perfect person process. So, go for it Carolyn.

[00:12:39.600] - Caroline
Okay, so, here is how this is all going to work, because I know that you're probably sitting there like, ""It's fine and dandy, but it's just still not going to work for me."" But we've got you because once you find your voice, once you're able to really hone it in and nail that down and figure out exactly what you stand for, then it will come through in your awesome content. And your perfect person is out there and will be like magnetized to it and will find it and will be like, ""Yes girl! I knew it. I knew there was someone out there who knew what I was thinking. "" They're going to join your email list because you're still speaking to them in a language that they understand and that no one else has spoken to them in that same way. You're going to be talking to them on your email list exactly the way that they need to hear it, touching on the pain points that they're like, ""I didn't think that anybody knew what I was feeling, what I was thinking, my pains I was having."" Then that is how you are going to turn them into your raving fans because you built the content that has drawn them in. They were magnetized to you immediately. In your email, they've become polarized and magnetized to you. Now they're like, ""Yes, yes, yes, yes. 300%, you are in my head. We're besties. I will throw all of my money at you in the best way possible.""

[00:13:52.590] - Caroline
And that's why it's so important that you be your own person and you don't fake it by trying to be someone else. When you're faking it, you're not able to write the exact content that your readers need to read. And you're not able to emulate that voice throughout every single email you send every week. And when you don't be your own person, you're- you're pulling in the wrong people. And when you pull in the wrong people, you have to do a lot of backtracking.

[00:12:21.660] - Tracy
So, our goal today is to help you find your voice right now so you can start bringing in the perfect person right now, so you don't have to go back and fix things from earlier on.

[00:14:29.740] - Caroline
Yeah.

[00:14:31.740] - Tracy
So, let's talk about finding your perfect person. So, if you feel like you were talking to everyone and you don't want to step on people's toes or annoy anyone, then don't skip this. Like Caroline said, we were people pleasers and we've since changed that. The magic happens when you just focus on your story and your message and your niche. Don't worry about how that message is going to be taken by people, because, like we said, love me or hate me, there's no money in the middle. So, you want to plant your flag and decide where you're going to stand. So, the right person people are attracted to you from the beginning?

[00:15:10.620] - Caroline
Yep.

[00:15:12.400] - Tracy
Okay, sorry.

[00:15:15.460] - Caroline
So, your homework is you are going to find your polarizing passion statements. Now I know that that's a big, scary word, right? It doesn't have to be all that this means as you're going to list out three to five things that you feel strongly about in your niche. The goal here is to- it is to get into- is to get your head in the right place to attract your real perfect person to your blog, to your email list, to your Instagram, to your YouTube, to wherever your Internet circle is. You have to figure out three to five things that you feel strongly about in your niche. Now, that doesn't have to be mean. It doesn't have to be nasty. It doesn't have to be anything that is like throwing mud at the other side, unless that's what you really want to do. For me, we're going to list some of our examples. So, I'm in the personal finance space and I feel like everybody in the entire world has an opinion on Dave Ramsey. Right. So, in personal finance, it's just easy to use Dave Ramsey is kind of this lightning rod; either you love him or you hate him. It's either one or the two camps, and there's really not a whole lot of middle ground. So, that's in my world. I would say I blank with Dave Ramsey. I agree with Dave Ramsey. I think he's completely wrong. That would be a polarizing passion statement, because if you're like, ""I love me some Dave Ramsey."" And I said, ""I disagree with everything the man says"", you would be like, ""All right, peace out. That's fine. We're done here."" It's immediately when you read a sentence like that, you know, if I am- if you are my person or you're not my person, without me ever having to say, ""If you don't agree with that, you can just leave."" Do you know what I mean?

[00:17:03.760] - Tracy
No, and I think that's important to say on my niche, it's done just a little bit differently because I blog about urban homesteading, which means how to grow a garden if you live in a city, how to have chickens, if you live in the suburbs. And that means anybody that's a self-sufficient bug out homesteader that lives off grid is not going to be attracted to me. So, my flag is the urban homesteader. And that tells people that aren't into that type of homesteading that this is not the place for them. So, when we say ""plant your flag"", it doesn't have to be- I don't know, it doesn't have to be super direct or yes/no or things like that. It just has to make sure that you're attracting the right people with that flag. You're like, ""Hey, if you live in the suburbs and you don't think you can live self sufficiently, I got you. Come over here. I'm your person. I'm the one that you want to read about.""

[00:17:56.260] - Caroline
Yeah.

[00:17:56.390] - Tracy
So there's different ways to do it. And we just want to encourage you to find the best way to plant your flag, decide what your flag is, and then own it all the way through.

[00:18:05.680] - Caroline
Yeah. And the big thing for it is there's no people pleasing allowed here. You can't say- I'm going to keep using my example because Tracy is going to make fun of me all the time. I know nothing at all about farm animals that I'm not going to embarrass myself; maybe a little bit later. I'll embarrass later. Don't worry,

[00:18:21.640] - Tracy
Okay.

[00:18:21.990] - Caroline
In my world, we're going to keep using Dave Ramsey. It would be the equivalent of me saying, ""I guess everybody could do what Dave Ramsey says or not whatever. It's not a big deal."" Are you going to tell somebody that you are like in love with this person who is a blogger on the Internet and you're like, ""They have no opinion on the most polarizing figure in the personal finance world."" They have no opinion on this? No. You're going to be like, ""Oh, my gosh, this other person absolutely loves this big blogger that I follow."" It has to be something that you're passionate about without diving into people pleasing. So, remember, you're allowed to take a stand because you will bring the right people to you.

[00:19:06.280] - Tracy
That's the ultimate goal. Absolutely. Okay. So, step number two is to make your perfect freebie. This is my favorite thing ever, because now that you know who it is you were talking to that person that has- that is coming to your flag, it's now going to be so much easier to figure out what it is they  need to bring them onto your email list.

[00:19:29.770] - Caroline
Yes.

[00:19:30.100] - Tracy
Because as you start honing in on every aspect of the flag planting process, you are going to make everything easier. So, if you ever struggled with coming up with a freebie, guess what? It's not going to be that scary anymore because you're in the right mindset. You're not faking it. It's exactly who you are and what you believe in. So, now you know the tools that you would need as a brand new person in your niche to get started doing it is- doing whatever it is that you're teaching.

[00:19:59.590] - Caroline
Yep.

[00:20:00.760] - Tracy
Okay, so for your homework, for step number two is you want to make a list of your readers pain points. Now, this is something that Caroline taught me that changed everything for me. Here's the thing, guys, if you know the exact pain points that your readers are having, then you can make a solution so much easier than what you're trying to do now. So, the solution is going to solve a pain point, and that solution is your freebie. And when you offer that freebie, that perfect person is going to read your content and say, Okay, ""This is exactly what I need."" Then they're going to see your freebie. And you're like, ""Oh my gosh, this is exactly what I have to have."" And the process just flows all the way through. Okay, so Caroline, would you like to talk about different pain points in how to do that for our homework?

[00:20:50.900] - Caroline
I absolutely would, because I absolutely love talking about pain points.

[00:20:53.450] - Tracy
You do that's why I'm asking.

[00:20:54.320] - Caroline
This is you- guys, this is like one of the big things that gets so overlooked is once you figure out your ideal person, you can hone in on their pain points, just like Tracey said, so much easier because you know them. So, I encourage you to do a complete brain dump. And what that means is you're literally sitting there pop in some earbuds, turn on like classical music or something, tone out the rest of the world and just fill up a page with all of the things that your ideal perfect person would be saying to themselves, would be struggling with. What are the words that they would use? What are they thinking about themselves? What are the limiting beliefs that they have? What do they want? What are their problems? And then all of this information fill up as much as you can.

[00:21:44.150] - Tracy
And if it makes it- I'm sorry, if it makes it easier, you can use prompts. So, talking. The first person of your reader, I wish, I struggle with, I hate, I need, I want. And just fill in as many answers for each of those prompts as you can do. And let me just say it was hard for me in the beginning when Caroline had me start doing this, but when you start, it's like the dam breaks open and all of these ideas come. So, when I first- when I did this for the first time, I'd like four things on there.

[00:22:14.900] - Caroline
Oh, yeah.

[00:22:15.170] - Tracy
And then after I did it a couple of times, it's like a page and a half.

[00:22:19.340] - Caroline
And the first four, it's like pulling teeth.

[00:22:21.860] - Tracy
Yeah.

[00:22:22.060] - Caroline
You're like, ""I don't know, I guess that they struggle with this, but I don't know what else."" And then once you start digging deeper and you force yourself to sit there for like 10, 15 minutes just writing about your person and what the struggles are, you will find that it becomes so much easier to get all that information out, because once you have that, then you can come back to this list and revisit it so that you can narrow down what kinds of a freebie can you offer to help them with that problem. Now, we're talking like a freebie here, guys. We're not getting into a product yet. We're not even going to go there. So, we're not telling you to make an entire course of like eight hundred different pages. We're talking like a checklist.

[00:23:04.580] - Tracy
Write a checklist.

[00:23:04.580] - Caroline
Yeah, a checklist, a day planner, a guide that they can do.

[00:23:10.400] - Tracy
A worksheet, a cheat sheet . Just one page is all you need to change someone's life forever. Forever. So, don't overthink it. Do your pain points, come up with solutions and just make a one page simple item that will help your readers.

[00:23:27.050] - Caroline
Yep. And then you're going to pick that one pain point that you can do. Just one. We're not trying to solve world hunger here. You're picking one pain point to give them a solution to in your freebie.

[00:23:38.660] - Tracy
Love it. Okay, so what's next?

[00:23:42.440] - Caroline
We're going to craft your perfect email.

[00:23:44.270] - Tracy
Yes. And by this point, guys, since you've already done step one and step two, step three should be a lot easier because you're- you're in that mindset now. You're in the zone.

[00:23:55.130] - Caroline
Yes.

[00:23:55.340] - Tracy
So now that you know your people, you know their pain point, you know their inner voice, you're on the same wavelength with them. You can speak a language that they will actually resonate with. This will build the connection you need to turn that casual reader into your perfect person.

[00:23:42.440] - Caroline
Yeah. And the goal is you literally want to be inside of their heads. And you've already done that work with saying what you feel about your needs and about your topic. You figure it out their pain points, and now you're going to make your perfect emails because it's going to be a lot easier to talk to people once you understand that; you don't have to put on ears to be liked. You already know who it is that you want to bring in. You already know how to talk to them and you know how to speak to them about their problems in a way that is going to click with them.

[00:24:44.090] - Tracy
Absolutely.

[00:24:48.450] - Caroline
We're going to solve your readers problems by being you. Easy peasy, tada. And that sounds a lot more trivialized than it really is, because I understand that you're like ""I don't understand what that means."" What that literally means is you're going to look at one of your readers- I think we have to go to the next slide.

[00:24:44.090] - Tracy
Oh, I'm sorry.

[00:25:08.740] - Caroline
Back, Okay- maybe- no- wait. No, this is fine. So, you need to let them know what you stand for inside of your e-mails by the words that you're using, by the way, that you're talking, by the way, that you are connecting with them and saying, look, ""I know that you struggle with X. I have struggled with X, too, but here's how I've overcome it. Here's the things that I've done."" And you're going to be writing these emails in a way that's just going to be easy. It's not going to have to sound robotic. You don't have to put on ears or sound like, you know, Martha Stewart or look like Martha Stewart, for all I care. You are going to be real with them inside of these emails because, again, you have the full permission to be you.

[00:25:54.130] - Tracy
Yeah. And this is your chance to be conversational. So, you know on our blog post. We're kind of more teacher role. We're kind of more serious in that. Your email, it's game over. You can do and be the exact person and you can give it to them full board. This is still another place where you're planting your flag, because let's look at it this way. When you write your blog post, you're planting a flag. When you're doing your freebie, you're planting just a little bit bigger flag. And when you get them on your email list, then you're put the big flag on there. You're putting it all you right there on the line. This is their last chance to stay or scoot. Good news if they stay, that's your person. Yeah, that is your person.

[00:26:38.200] - Caroline
It's really true. So the goal is you have to let them know every single step of this journey- you have to let them know that they are in the right place. And if you went from being super conversational in a post to being like a college professor with MLA citations in your emails, they're going to be like, ""What happened here?"" ""Who is this person?"" ""I connected with this person in this post. I don't know who is emailing me.""

[00:27:02.590] - Tracy
Right.

[00:27:02.950] - Caroline
And then they'll unsubscribe. We don't want that to happen. You want to continue to be yourself, because the way that you're going to connect with your people is by letting them know that they are in the right place every step of the way.

[00:27:14.770] - Tracy
Okay, with that being said, you don't want to be a jerk.

[00:27:19.870] - Caroline
No, no. You need to give them help. You can't just send them. ""You know what I found out that was really annoying today."" Nobody needs to hear all of that email. You want to still address a problem that they're having inside of the emails because you know, their pain points. You can touch on them every single time, even if it's something as trivial as like ""I did something this week and I thought about you because I encountered a pain point that you probably have that I had to. And here's how I solved it."" And I'm infusing my personality. I'm sharing stories about my life. I'm allowing you to understand, like I'm a real person, like we're building this connection the entire time.

[00:27:58.720] - Tracy
And I think that's super important to touch on.

[00:28:02.110] - Caroline
Oh yeah.

[00:28:02.470] - Tracy
That is their chance to resonate with you.

[00:28:05.440] - Caroline
Yep.

[00:28:05.680] - Tracy
If you share something that happens in your day, then it helps them make that connection. And when you're not faking it, you can share things in your day without thinking, ""All right, how am I going to color this, so, it matches my voice."" You don't have to worry about that. It's just natural conversation in an email that helps your reader resonate with you even more. So, that is huge that you know your thing.

[00:28:26.320] - Caroline
Yes, it's true. However, we do want to point out that when we talk about polarizing things, it's easy. And Tracy, I had to walk Tracy through this, too. When I say polarizing, she automatically thought being a jerk.

[00:28:40.840] - Tracy
Yes.

[00:28:41.490] - Caroline
It's so easy to think like, well, I could just bash everybody. No, no, no, no, no. You can be honest and be fully you with out bashing other people, without slinging mud or without being mean. You can be passionate. You cannot be mean unless that's really what you want to do. But I feel like we've cov-

[00:29:00.700] - Tracy
So, basically what you're saying is and I know I'm asking a question in our own side show, but basically what you're saying is it's okay+ to be positive about the stance that you're taking without throwing anybody else under the bus.

[00:29:12.940] - Caroline
Yeah.

[00:29:13.660] - Tracy
Perfect.

[00:29:14.260] - Caroline
You can say, like, I'm going to keep mu- I mean, I guess- I- let me use- let's use goats, for example, because Caroline knows nothing about goats, but okay. So, you could say, you know, like there's two different camps of you need to have 150 acres if you ever want to have goats or there's people who say, ""I keep them in my postage stamp backyard because it's like- it's like a dog."" If you come in and say, ""I think anybody who doesn't have over 100 acres for their animals is mean and terrible and should be reported to the the authorities."" If you came in and said that, that would be like, whoa, attacking. You don't need to say that. You can take your stance. Be passionate about what you have to say without being mean. So, that's all we want to kind of get to through you guys is not- we're not saying under any circumstances to be a jerk, be passionate, plant your flag and you don't have to throw anybody under the bus in that process.

[00:30:10.380] - Tracy
I love that, okay, maybe some of you still need a little more permission. Guess what? This is your permission to fully be yourself and plant your flag.

[00:30:22.590] - Caroline
Take a picture of the page if you want. We'll even smile for you here. Ready? Screenshot! Please post that on Instagram and tag us, we're @bloggingonpoint on Instagram. I would love to see that all over Instagram. That would just make my day.

[00:30:39.860] - Tracy
That would be awesome.

[00:30:41.110] - Caroline
This is the thing, guys: When we were first starting, we felt like we weren't good enough. We felt like we didn't have enough to say. Like, who were we to have an opinion? How dare we?

[00:30:54.400] - Tracy
Who am I to talk about this?

[00:30:56.280] - Caroline
Yes. And we felt inferior and like we weren't good enough. And it almost- it almost cost us our blogs. I feel like it's pretty safe to say like this, if that had continued, I would have quit because it's so hard to continue to try to be something that you're not.

[00:31:12.220] - Tracy
It's exhausting.

[00:31:12.960] - Caroline
This is your permission to be yourself, to fully be yourself, to show up as you authentically to say what you have to say authentically, to voice your opinion and your authority in your niche. You have authority, by the way, just in case you feel like you don't you have authority, you know what you're talking about, otherwise you wouldn't be there. This is an important part for you guys to understand, is you can fully be yourself and still have a huge following on the Internet.

[00:31:49.990] - Tracy
Absolutely.

[00:31:52.160] - Caroline
They're little healthy dose of of rah rah motivation.

[00:31:57.920] - Tracy
Motivational speak on planting your flag by Tracy and Caroline. 

[00:32:04.050] - Caroline
Tada!

[00:32:04.580] - Tracy
Okay, so let's talk about planting your flag because let's be honest, the online world is crowded and you really need to find your corner to take your stand and to preach it from the rooftops so that your perfect people can find you.

[00:32:19.350] - Caroline
Yeah, because if you're not taking a stand, think about it. People don't- I tried to convey this earlier and I totally botched it. But think about it. People don't share their favorite blogger unless they have a stand. I'm not going to share about somebody who I can't remember how they feel about something. If you didn't take any kind of a stand, it's not memorable. It's not like there's something that clicks there. It just becomes noise. Do you know what I mean? Like the world of the Internet is full of so many people. If you're going to want to stand out like we do for our businesses, for our brands, for our blogs, we have to stand out. It's our responsibility to stand out to help our people who are out there thinking that nobody gets them. There's people out there right now looking for somebody who has your voice, who has your story, who has your stance on everything that they're thinking. And they're out there right now thinking, ""Nobody gets me.""

[00:33:22.880] - Tracy
Yeah, nobody gets me. Use that flag to bring them in, waving it as hard as you can to get them to see you, to get them to hear you, to get them in your corner so that they can find you.

[00:33:35.390] - Caroline
Yep.

[00:33:36.260] - Tracy
Absolutely.

[00:33:40.290] - Caroline
Do I read it? Do you want to read it?

[00:33:43.680] - Tracy
Go for it. There's a lot of words on this page. You read.

[00:33:45.480] - Caroline
Okay, when you plant your flag, this is how you know that you have hit the planting your flag gold- that you have struck gold on exactly what it is that you are trying to convey in your messaging. You are going to be calling in the right people and you're going to clear out anybody from your world, from your email list who is there for the wrong reason, a.k.a. not your perfect people. You will begin to be able to celebrate your unsubscribes. I know that you guys have heard that for like forever- to celebrate the unsubscribes. You're like, ""But it still hurts."" Here's the thing: When you plant your flag and are able to be fully, authentically you and every single thing that you ever create, you will know that the people who are leaving are not your people and that they are going to make room for the right people on your list.

[00:34:39.570] - Tracy
And that's a game changer when you look at it that way you guys.

[00:34:42.430] - Caroline
I know right?

[00:34:42.540] - Tracy
I mean, I had a hard time with my first couple of unsubscribes. You know what? It's a mindset shift that you need to make. So, don't focus on who's leaving. Focus on who's staying, because those are your people. Those are the people that you're going to turn your blog into an online business with and for. And that is so important for you guys to keep that focus front and center at all times, let everybody else go. You keep your attention where it matters with your perfect person.

[00:35:13.740] - Caroline
Yep. And that way you will be able to explode your list with exactly who you want to talk to, a.k.a. your perfect people.

[00:35:25.530] - Tracy
Absolutely. Absolutely. And we both believe beyond a shadow of a doubt, that you 100% can do it.

[00:35:35.420] - Caroline
Without a question, without a question. Now, we know that it's going to be hard in the beginning. We understand that it's going to be something for you to get over of. Like ""I'm allowed to say my opinion."" Of course you are. And it's going to take some time. And yes, when you first start being able to be authentically you, you are going to see more people leaving your space. But at the same time, you're going to see more people coming in who agree with you. You're going to get more comments, more replies, more likes, more follows from the right people who are like, ""Yes, I thought that I was the only person who thought that. You were going to find your people very, very quickly and know that without a shadow of a doubt that they are there for you, not because they accidentally stumbled across your blog, not because you had the best, shiniest, most, prettiest, most giving everything away a freebie out there. And that was all that they wanted. Another on your list and you're like, ""Oh, crap, how'd I get here?"" You know that you're going to have the right people. We know that you can do it without a question.

[00:36:40.130] - Tracy
Without a question. Okay, so Caroline and I love to give marching orders. And basically what that means is a list of actionable items that you can do to take what we taught you and put it into action, because we're not- we're not about theory. I mean, that's a good thing. But we're not about theory. We're about taking action and implementing the things that we learn. So, we have marching orders for you.

[00:36:40.130] - Caroline
We do. And you can get that as the PDF download if you go to Bloggingonpoint.com/BBS, and we have it for you and it's free. And it's basically this presentation with a few extra little fun things on there for you guys, because there's- there's no reason for you guys to hear more information if you're not going to take action. And so that's what we wanted to give you are some actual action items for you to take from today going forward.

[00:37:33.710] - Caroline
And we cannot wait to see how your business changes and grows and how much more you love being able to do what you do. And don't forget, take us on Instagram.

[00:37:41.870] - Caroline
If you took a screenshot of us being weird, by the way, like it's @Bloggingonpoint, here's a picture of us being all right, guys, that we believe in you and have a great rest of your day.

[00:37:53.630] - Tracy
You got this bye.

[00:37:55.220] - Caroline
Bye.

Liz Stapleton [00:00:13]:
of the monetization side of it too, kind of Once you've funneled them onto your list, what do you do as well? If I correct me if I'm wrong, but Cindy, thank you so much for being here. I appreciate it.

Thank you. I'm so excited to to join you for this. This is such a an amazing, an amazing event and an an amazing topic to to cover. And I love email marketing, so I'm always happy to talk about it. Like, one of my favorite things.

Liz Stapleton [00:00:41]:
so can you give us just a little bit sort of back your about your background so we kinda know where you're coming from and then the highlights of what you're gonna cover in your presentation.

Cindy Bidar [00:00:49]:
Sure. So my background is I have worked full time online, for the past 9 years now. I started out as a content and copywriter as a freelancer. I moved from there into virtual assistance, and I did technical and marketing virtual assistance for several years. And now I have shifted away from doing the client work, and I'm doing online training and education around marketing for coaches and bloggers and other service providers. Okay. So that's kind of my, my career arc there in a nutshell. And what I focus on now is teaching people how to automate their marketing, how to systemize their marketing, how to create the processes and the procedures, so that they can make more money and spend a lot less time in their office.

Liz Stapleton [00:01:39]:

Cindy Bidar [00:01:47]:
Yeah. Absolutely. So what I find in talking to my clients is that a lot of times, they don't really know where to get started with email marketing. So what I've put together is a presentation that's going to walk them through exactly how to start to build that email marketing list, what to do with those people when they're on their once they're on the list, how to kind of monetize it without feeling all icky all the time about being all salesy. so that's kind of the gist of of what we're gonna cover in the next 30 minutes or so.

Liz Stapleton [00:02:20]:
Okay. Awesome. I'm I'm excited to dig in.

Cindy Bidar [00:02:24]:

So Let's dig right in with easy email funnels that serve your audience and earn a profit too, and they won't be icky. I promise. Here's what I hear from pretty much everybody. when they're first starting out, whether that's you know, whether they're bloggers or they're, affiliate marketers or they're service providers or they're authors. It doesn't matter who they are. the the common statement is I don't even know where to start with building a marketing funnel. And I will tell you what, I have a little survey when people First, join my list that asks them what do they most need help with when it comes to building marketing funnels and probably 80% of the responses are I don't even know where to start. So if that's you, super super common. You are not alone. You are in some very good company. And even more importantly, that's where we all were when we first started out. So it's easy to overcome. I'm gonna help you get started today. And where do we start? Before you even think about the technology, before you even think about making sales offers, before you even think about what a funnel does or how it works, I want you to start with the goal in mind. and not just your goal. Although that's important, we're gonna start with your goal, but we wanna talk about Another goal. We wanna talk about your ideal client's goals because those 2 things, your goal and her goal, and I'm gonna I'm gonna call your ideal client her throughout this presentation. That's just the pronoun that I use. So if your ideal client is a man, This works too. But we're gonna talk about your goal and we're gonna talk about her goal and how they both work together to build an email funnel that serves and earns a profits. Now your goal, this is easy. At least I think it's easy for you. Your goal, you have something to sell. You sell a product. Maybe it's a digital product. Maybe it's an ebook. maybe you sell consulting or coaching or maybe you sell physical products on Etsy or Maybe your whole goal is to drive traffic back to your website, so that you can present people with display ads, and that's how you earn on your blog. Whatever your goal is, that's kind of the first piece that you're gonna keep in mind. where do I want people to go? Where do I ultimately want to send them through the use of this email funnel that I'm building? I want you to keep that in mind as we work kinda through the rest of this. Next, I want you to think about what does your ideal client want? because that's really even more important. If you want to build relationships with people through an email funnel, then you have to start with What do they want? What can you provide to them that's gonna satisfy that need? And we're gonna talk about a a technique that I use to do this in just a second, but I want you to I wanna share an example with you. one of my clients, for example, has, or he is a dating and relationship coach for women in midlife. And what his clients want, what they say they want, and what they actually want are 2 very different things. And that's where 5 whys technique comes in. So what his clients say they want is they want to get married or they want a committed relationship or they want to meet a nice man who's not already married or they want someone to be with on Valentine's day. Right? But that's not -- what they really want. When we dig deeper, when we use this 5 whys technique, and the way this works is to just continue continually ask why, right, just like a toddler just asks why all the time. Why? Why? Why? Why? If you've ever been around a toddler, maybe you've been really annoyed by that. I know I have. I don't have kids. So, you know, it I don't get toddlers, but I know they question everything. And I want you to do that as well when you're building out your email funnel. And here's why. Because What your ideal client says he or she wants is probably not the whole truth. So if we go back to my client and his dating and relationship coaching, his ideal client would say they wanna get married. But if you dig deeper, if you ask why, why do they wanna get married? Well, because they want security or they want companionship. Why do they want security and companionship? because they're lonely. Why are they lonely? Well, maybe because they don't have any friends or maybe they live far away from their family, Well, why is that? And when you really dig deep into it, what he has discovered is what his clients really want is they want to be happy in their life, and they feel that by meeting someone by meeting the right man, that's going to make them happy. But what he's discovered is that's not really the case that happiness actually comes from the inside. So if he can help them find that internal happiness, then that's a better service for them than just helping them meet some random guy on a Tinder app. So that's the kind of dig. That's the kind of deep digging I want to encourage you to do when you're thinking about what does your ideal client or what does your ideal customer or your ideal reader? What do they really want? They and and what they really want may not be what they say they want. So you have to be able to read between the lines and really know them and under stand their motivations and where they're coming from and what their goal really is. And that's gonna put you on the right path to building that email marketing funnel. Here's another way to look at it by asking the so what question? This comes from copywriting. If you've done any copywriting written any sales pages, read any copywriting books, you've probably come across this this technique of differentiating the features from the benefits. So a feature is a description of something. my coffee cup is blue. That's a feature of it. So what? That's the benefit if I answer that So what question I can get to the benefit of having a blue coffee cup? So what? Well, I like the color blue. That's what? So asking that so what question is really gonna help you as well dig into that why your customers want what they want or why your ideal clients want what they want. So they, you know, in the case of my dating and relationship coach client, he his clients think that they want to get married. Well, so what? So they won't be lonely anymore. That's their goal. So if the 5 why's question is kinda stumping you a little bit, then ask yourself So what? When they get this, so what? When they get this thing that they want, so what? What's what's the what there? Alright. So now that we know what your ideal customer's big goal is, what she really, really wants. Let's talk about how you can use your email funnel to help her, help her get there. And the way that we do that is by addressing the elephant in the room. We wanna figure out what's standing in her way and help her get past those hurdles. One big hurdle is tools and technology. So is she lacking the proper equipment, the supplies or other necessary items? An example of this would be if you say you teach, say you teach piano lessons online, maybe you have a membership that that has a piano training, video training inside. If your ideal customer doesn't have a piano, It's gonna be really hard for her to make use of your training. So your job is to, as the expert here, is to make the recommendations to help her make good buying decisions and to help her decide which tools and which technology are the right fit for her. So another example is say you have a recipe blog. Right? Recipe blogs are Super common these days and super helpful. I spend a ton of time browsing recipe blogs. I'll tell you what. I love to read stories. I love to read about new techniques, new to me, and, learn new recipes and also I need the help in the kitchen with the tools and the technology. It was through a recipe blog that I bought my instant pot. It was through a recipe blog that I order new, you know, new to me spices that I've never tried before. So The tools and the technology that are required for your ideal customer to reach her goal are one important part of your funnel content. And, of course, the way you make money with that is by recommending products that you have an affiliate relationship with. What else is standing in her way? Knowledge gaps are a big one. Does she have the basic skills in place, or does she need a quick refresher course? you can easily fill an email funnel with ""how to"" content that helps your reader or your ideal customer build up those skills. So, again, you know, I if I'm subscribed to a recipe blog and I am interested in learning how, you know, learning how to, cook a really great steak. or grill a really great steak. An email that teaches me the techniques to do that, how to know what the proper temperature of the grill is, and and how to get that that really important seared look on the steak and how to make it fork tender on the grill without turning it into a piece of leather. Those things in an email funnel are gonna be very, very helpful to me. They're not immediately monetizable. They're not they're not gonna bring you immediate money probably, but they're gonna go a long ways toward building those important relationships and keeping your, your email subscribers engaged and active on your email list and reading your emails and moving through your funnel and and making their way towards not only her goal, but yours as well, which is the ultimate goal that you have for your email subscribers. Another thing that you can address in your email funnel is a lack of confidence. This can keep people from trying new things, it can keep people from stepping out of their comfort zone, but it can be easily overcome with the right content. And the types of content that addresses a lack of confidence in your audience are things like case studies or testimonials where you've had other clients or or even yourself where you've overcome some challenge and achieved a goal that is related to what your ideal customer wants. Those kinds of inspirational stories. An example of this is gonna be like weight watchers. If you've ever been on weight watchers or you've ever subscribed to their content, or I would imagine other other weight loss platforms, you know, Jenny Craig, whatever, all have similar, similar styles in their email funnel They will send these inspirational stories about how Sarah lost 75 pounds and you see the before and after picture that can build up the confidence in somebody, build up their, their desire for the goal Plus give them the encouragement to think, hey. If Sarah did this, I can do it too. So the that kind of content has a really important place in your email funnel. No time or money. This is really I gotta be honest here. This is really rarely a real issue. Most often, these are simply objections that people throw out because they can't think of any other reason why they wouldn't buy whatever it is you are offering. And you can address those objections throughout your sales process, throughout your email funnel, and really overcome them easily by not even addressing them directly because what's important to people. If you get to that, if you go back to when we talked about what the real goal is, what the real need is, if you can dig into that and skip past that surface need that they think they want and get to the real issue, then the no time or money thing is not even gonna come up because what people really, really want, what they're really passionate about, what they really desire, they will find the time and the money for. So if you're hearing this objection or you're seeing this objection or you know, your your people are telling you, yeah, that's that's an interesting that's an interesting idea, and I would totally get that, but I don't have the time to study that, or I don't have the money to buy that right now. Then I would say you're probably not getting at the real root goal. You're not digging deep enough into that. Now I don't care what it is that you are selling, what it is that your ultimate funnel goal is There are 3 elements that you need to address within your email funnel in order to make that sale at the end, and that's know, have, and believe. And let's start with the 'know'. Your subscribers, your email subscribers, the people who opt into your list, your community at large, has a prerequisite. They need to know certain things before they can make use of whatever it is you are selling and I don't care if what you're selling is consulting or if what you're selling is an instant pot through an Amazon link or what you're selling is a multi-module training course that you developed and sell for 1000 of dollars. There are certain things that your ideal client needs to know before she can take advantage of any offer. And I'm gonna tell you in just a second how you can address this need in your email funnel, but let's take a look at have and believe first. So the second thing that is required in an email funnel or that is required of your ideal customer for they can make a buying choice is they have to have some things in place. What do they need to already have at their disposal? to make use of your product. This might be tangible things. It might be the tools or the technology or the supplies. Maybe they need paintbrushes or they need an instant pot or they need a piano. Or it can be the intangible things like we talked about the self confidence or the perception of enough time. So what is your ideal customer need to have? And, again, I'm gonna share, I'm gonna tell you exactly how to give that to them in your email funnel in just a second, but before we get there, they also need to believe certain things. Your ideal buyer needs to believe that not only is she capable of achieving this goal, but that you are capable of helping her to get there. And that's important, and we're gonna go over that in just a second. So know, have, and believe. These are three things that you must cover in your email funnel. Okay. So how do we actually put this to work inside your email funnel? So the know piece becomes informational content. This is commonly called nurturing. This is where you are sending your email client or you're email subscribers. You are sending them things like ""how to"" blog posts, video demonstrations, checklists, webinars, and other free training that can fill in those knowledge gaps that they have in order to prepare them to take advantage of your offer at the end of the funnel. So for example, You might have, like I said, ""how to"" blog posts. You might have YouTube, videos that you've recorded that demonstrate a technique you might have checklist to help them follow a pros a process or a procedure. You might have free webinars that offer more information. You might have other free training that they can opt in for that's going to help them build those skills and fill in those gaps in their knowledge. The 'have' component, now this is where we get promotional, and this is where I get a lot of pushback from people, if I'm honest, because people tend to think that it's not okay to sell. And I wanna tell you that it is absolutely okay to sell in your email funnels. In fact, it's your job to sell in your email funnels. I wanna tell you something that I learned in the in the corporate world. Before I worked online, I was a buyer for a smallish factory, automotive factory here in Michigan where I live. And I was the only buyer. So I was, like, in charge of purchasing everything from the nuts and bolts that held the machines together to the raw material we used to create the parts, to the tires on the truck that we used to deliver them. everything came across my desk, and it was not unusual for the department head to call me up and say, you know, hey, I need a, I need a particular grade of cardboard to pack these parts in, and we're having a problem you know, with the parts getting damaged on the way. So we need to figure out a new way to pack those. Order me some cardboard boxes for that. Well, I I don't know anything about cardboard boxes. This is not my this is not I didn't go to school and learn about cardboard, but I had people I could turn to, and those people were the salesman. That's their job. It's their job to know all about the cardboard. It's their job to know all about nuts and bolts and screws and cleaning materials and tie truck tires. And The list goes on. There is an army of salespeople out there who are very, very knowledgeable, and all I had to do was pick up the phone and call them. And they would help me figure it out. And that's your job too. It's your job to help your ideal customer make informed buying decisions, whether that is an informed buying decision about your product or an informed buying decision about an affiliate product that you are promoting in your email funnel. The key is that it needs to satisfy this 'have' portion of your funnel. It needs to satisfy a need for your ideal client. And ideally, it needs to help her get one step closer to taking advantage of your offer. Whatever it is that you're selling, whether that's coaching and consulting, or a course, or just additional resources that you are an affiliate for. So your promotional content, those sales emails definitely have a place in your email funnel, and they are of service to your ideal client. So I don't want you to ever forget that. I don't want you to ever think that sending sales emails is annoying or it's icky or you shouldn't be doing it because you absolutely should. It is your job as the expert in your market to be sharing that information with ideal customer. Okay. I wanna skip back to this slide for just just a minute here because this is really important. We talked about asking, so what? We talked about the difference between the features and the benefits. And often what I see happening in email funnels is If you are promoting a particular product or a particular course or a particular, you know, kitchen appliance, whatever it is, whatever it is that you are offering that your ideal customer needs to have in order to take advantage of what your larger offer is. You need to get super clear on the so what piece of that because that's what's gonna make the connection between what you're offering, what you're selling, and what their ideal or what their ultimate goal is, what they really, really want to achieve and why they're listening to you in the first place. A really simple example of this, I told you that I bought my instant pot through a recipe blog, through a link on a recipe blog from Amazon. And I'm certain that the the blogger got an affiliate commission on that, at least I hope she did. But the reason why it the reason why I clicked that link, the reason why I bought it is because she made it clear that the instant pot was not just a pressure cooker. It was not just, you know, a a $100 appliance. It was it was the way that she expressed the so what that made it clear to me that that was what was going to bring me closer to my goal of spending less time in the kitchen and eating delicious food and not having to, you know, spend an hour a half cooking it. So she made that connection between the instant pot that's a pressure cooker and the so what, which is eat delicious food in less time and and make it easier to cook. So that was the so what of the instant pot. And that led naturally to my bigger desire, my bigger goal of more variety in my meals, and less time in the kitchen. So make that connection by really getting clear on what is the so what of whatever it is you're offering. And then the last piece, of course, is the belive. So this is where that inspirational content comes in that we talked about. This is where you're going to be sharing case studies and interviews and testimonials and photos and video and data, if it is applicable. So in my case, data is super applicable because I teach people how to make more money online. So data is important to me if you're teaching people how to use their instant pot, maybe not so much. But interviews and testimonials and photos and video, absolutely. make it real for your ideal customer. Make them believe that they can have that too, that they can achieve that goal that they can have that beautiful Christmas dinner that they can have that amazing relationship they can learn to play the piano, whatever it is that you are teaching, whatever it is that you are selling, the inspirational content piece of your marketing funnel, is where that all comes together for them and where they start to picture it and visualize it for themselves. Alright. So let's recap. When it comes to building an email marketing funnel, what you're going to do is start Always, always, always start with the goal in mind. Keep your goal in mind and your ideal customer's goal. And not just the surface-level goal, dig deep and find out what the real goal is that she has because it's probably -- not what she's telling you. You can use the 5 why's technique or ask yourself, so what? Why does she want what she's telling me she wants? So what? What's that gonna do for her in the end? that's gonna help you dig in and really get to that really real felt need. Next, you're gonna wanna uncover the roadblocks while stopping her from being there now. What's keeping her from having that relationship what's keeping her from creating that beautiful dinner for her family. What's keeping her from learning to play the piano at sixty years old. What is preventing her? What's standing in her way from getting what she really, really wants? Next, address the knows, the how, the haves, and the believes. What does she need to know in order to get there? What does she need to have in place in order to get there? And what she need to believe not only about herself, but about you or about the world in general before she's ready to take action. And finally, throughout your entire email funnel, be the resource that your client needs. They know people don't sign up for your email list because they want you to send them a bunch of fluff. They don't sign up for your email list because you had a cute picture on your on your homepage. They sign up for your email list because they see you as an expert in what you talk about. And as the expert, you have a duty to your email community to be the resource that they need to find success in whatever your niche is, whatever your industry is, whatever your subject matter is. Be the resource that your client needs and don't Don't fall into the trap of thinking that you can't email them offers or that you can't share these amazing resources with them because because people will think that you're spammy or that you are just selling all the time. Don't fall into that trap that it's icky because it is not. It is in the highest service to your ideal customer to be making those offers, and it's what keeps your business in the black. Without the income from your email marketing efforts, you're gonna have to work so much harder in your business just to stay afloat. So don't look at it as if you are being too salesy or too icky or too spammy. Look at it as if you are serving your clients because you are. And you're serving yourself as well by giving yourself the gift of a good income from this business that you work so hard in. I know that sometimes we we might struggle with taking the information that we learn in a training like this and actually putting it into practice. So I want to give you a resource that I created as a part of a paid training product. My funnels 101 course. I wanna give you this resource. It's an email funnel planner. And what it's going to help you do is it's gonna walk you through the different types of emails that you might send in an email funnel. Now the example that I'm using, it is an example from that course is, someone who sells or Christmas ornament patterns and Christmas ornament supplies. So you'll see the example given in in this worksheet of the ideal customer wanting to create a better Christmas memories for her grandchildren but the concept works regardless of what your ideal customer's ultimate goal is And you will see on this worksheet that I've laid out a hypothetical funnel that addresses all of the roadblocks and the know's, the haves, and the belives that we talked about in this training, and you can then take that and plug in your own customers roadblocks and your own customers knows, haves, and believes and actually write out the email funnel that's going to lead her to your ultimate funnel goal, which is to make a purchase by your product hire you for consulting or whatever that case is. So I wanna invite you to download that and work through that as you're building out your own email funnels. I really hope you have found this information helpful and that you are able to go forward and create email funnels that serve your customers and serve you as well. It's been my pleasure to speak with you today. Thank you so much for being here.

I get I I'm embarrassed to tell you how long I paid for an Aweber account that I never used. So this is all about building up that momentum and keeping that going, keeping that energy going and not make not turning it into a huge time suck.

**Transcript:**
[00:00:09.580] - Destini Copp, destinicopp.com
Hello to everyone with the Blogger Breakthrough Summit! My name is Dr. Destini Copp, and I am so excited to be here with you today and you may be in one of these two categories. You may have a lead magnet, but for whatever reason it's just not converting for you. And you're thinking, you know, what should I do instead? Or maybe you are absolutely starting from scratch and you are trying to figure out what type of lead magnet should you create that would attract your perfect customer.

[00:00:44.530] - Destini
And if either one of those are you, you are in the right place today. Before I jump into the material, I just want to introduce myself. I am the host of The Course Creators MBA Podcast, Summit, Facebook and Instagram, ads consultant and a sales funnel expert. I help entrepreneurs create and sell online courses. In addition to all of that, I'm also a university marketing professor and a tennis player and a dog lover and you will find me on the tennis court throughout the entire year.

[00:01:18.430] - Destini
So let's jump right in. And you may be asking what is a lead magnet? And simply put, a lead magnet on it is a valuable piece of content that you give your audience for free in exchange for their name and their email address. So your goal is to build your email list and you may have more than one lead magnets. These are also referred to as maybe opt-ins.

[00:01:44.140] - Destini
For example, when you go to somebody's blog post, they may have a special opt-in for that particular blog post that is different from the main lead magnet on the front page of their website. In this training today, we're going to focus on your main lead magnet and we are going to make your lead magnet irresistible so that they have to sign up for your list when they come to your website. Maybe they're coming from social media, maybe you're in a Facebook group or you're sharing the link to your website.

[00:02:17.980] - Destini
We want them to come to your whatever landing page or whatever that you have your lead magnet on. And we want them to sign up and get on your email list. So let's talk about this in a little bit more detail. So your primary lead magnet begins the process to take your prospect on what we call the buyer's journey. So in marketing, there is something called the buyer's journey. You go through it whenever you go out to make a buying decision.

[00:02:49.240] - Destini
Let's just say you're buying a new washer-dryer for your house. You go through this buyer's journey to make that purchasing decision. Now, in the Awareness Stage of the buyer's journey, that is when your prospect becomes aware that they are that they have an issue, that they're experiencing pain. And this is when they start conducting research to understand their problem. They don't really know a lot about it right now. The Awareness Stage is when you want your prospect or your future customer to find you so you can start building the Know, Like, and Trust Factor.

[00:03:30.730] - Destini
Now, after the awareness stage, buyers move into the Consideration Stage. So in the Consideration Stage, this is when your prospects, they know what their issue is and they're researching all possible solutions to solve this particular problem. So they've defined the problem. They know what the problem is and they're going out and they're looking at different ways that they can solve this problem. So think about it this way. So let's just say that, you know that you need a new car and you're not really sure what kind of car that you want to buy.

[00:04:11.550] - Destini
You don't know if you want a pickup truck or SUV or, you know, just, you know, a sedan. So you're researching all of these possible solutions to solve this problem. That means you're in the Consideration Stage and then at some point you're going to move into the Decision Stage. Now, in the Decision Stage, this is when your prospects, they know how they're going to solve the problem and they're researching all possible brands of vendors that can solve this problem and will make a purchase decision.

[00:04:48.400] - Destini
So in this particular state, taking our vehicle issue as an example, you need a new vehicle, at this stage let's just say, you know, that you want an SUV, OK? And you know, you want a specific kind of SUV, maybe. You want a GMC Yukon. In this case, you are going out and there's a lot of different dealerships in your area that sell these type of cars, maybe you want a new one or used one. So you're going out and you're researching all the possible brands and vendors that can solve this issue and you are going to be making a purchase decision soon.

[00:05:31.720] - Destini
That means, that's why they call it the Decision Stage. So let's talk about what makes a good lead magnet. Now, a good lead magnet needs to be specific and related to your products and services. And the reason for that is your lead magnet is going to take them along that buyer's journey that we just talked about. We also want it to solve a real problem for them because if your lead magnet doesn't solve a real problem that your ideal customer has, or if it doesn't give them something that they really, really want, it's just not going to work for them.

[00:06:10.150] - Destini
And you also want it to demonstrate your expertise in why you're the best person to help them. You also want it to be high of high value, perceived value and actual value. You don't, you know, that is key to all of this and you want it to be delivered immediately so that they can have instant gratification. So that's a few things that make a good lead magnet. But let's talk about what makes a lead magnet worthy of a Facebook ad. Now, here's the key here.

[00:06:45.520] - Destini
You may have heard in the past that you need an easy to digest lead magnet. And I would agree with this to some extent. But, and again, you can give your new prospect, your new email subscriber bite-sized information, because you don't want to overwhelm them necessarily, but you need them to commit. You want somebody who's actually going to take action on your free gift. These are your future clients. You want people who are willing to actually do the work and they aren't looking for an easy fix.

[00:07:23.620] - Destini
You want people who are up for a challenge so they can get change in their life. Otherwise, what's going to happen is that your free gift is just going to sit in their email or even worse, they don't even bother to download or do anything with it. The bottom line is you don't want these freebie seekers. So many people fill up their lists with people who just want free stuff. That's not what we're going to do. We are going to ask them to invest their most important asset, which is their time.

[00:07:59.080] - Destini
So let's talk about this in a little bit more detail. I'm going to give you some specific examples here. What are some ways you can ask your prospect to invest their time? One is through a quiz. Now quizzes are fun and they're engaging. But it's also, you know, it's also asking them to actually spend some time going through it. A mini course is one of my favorite lead magnets, because, and also it can be particularly effective for online course creators because you're demonstrating your expertise.

[00:08:38.080] - Destini
They're engaging in your mini-course, they're, you know, finding ways or learning about how you teach. It can be great! Also, a mini-workshop series. I will give you a specific example of this in the Pass, and that is a great way to demonstrate your expertise. A mini-workshop series has been one of my best lead magnets. Also, training videos are great and you can combine these with a checklist or a cheat sheet or a workbook as a supplemental resource.

[00:09:13.360] - Destini
But I love training videos! Why? Because you are asking them to invest their time. Also another example is an audio file and an audio file, and this is basically something that they can listen to, you know, listen to some type of lead magnet that they can listen to. And it can be a very inspirational way to engage with your audience. And I'll give you some specific examples of these in just a second. Some other examples are printables with some type of informative training video. Also a budget spreadsheet with a how-to use it type of video. Scripts and swipe files are great lead magnets, but also make sure that you find a way to interact with them, along with these scripts and swipe files. For example, do a five-day email series explaining how to customize these swipe files. Also a resource list, if you do a resource list, make sure you have a how-to type of video for a specific resource showing them how to use it. Again, you're asking them to invest their time.

[00:10:29.820] - Destini
So all of those are super, super important. Now, here's an example for you. This is a mini-workshop series. Actually have this on the front page of my website. And it is simply a mini-workshop series that is delivered over a course of seven days. And I walk them through how to launch a high converting ad campaign in only five days, even if you are starting from scratch. So like on day one, you can see the day one video here.

[00:10:58.470] - Destini
I do have workbooks and worksheets throughout this. So they're getting the videos on days one through days five, along with some supplemental material. And it has been a great way to ask them to invest their time. But also this is definitely demonstrating my expertise so that'll give you some examples there. Here's another example. This is from Marie Forleo and this is her audio file or free audio training on how to get the clarity and confidence to build your dreams on your own terms.

[00:11:35.460] - Destini
And it's just an audio file that they can listen to. Here's another one that I absolutely love. And this is a seven-day free green smoothie challenge. So a great way to interact with them. You're asking them to invest their time. It's a great lead magnet. Here's something else. And the reason why I love these, this is a super easy lead magnet, it's something that they can go back to and use over and over again. I think this one was from Chris Carr, if I remember correctly.

[00:12:12.210] - Destini
And it is basically a stress relief meditation, it's a five-minute meditation file. It is something that they can go back to and listen to however many more times they want. It demonstrates her expertise and it is engaging. On the right here, what's your love language? This is an example of a quiz. So they go through and answer the questions and based on their answers, you're going to send them specific information that is customized based on their answers.

[00:12:44.910] - Destini
Again, you're asking them to invest their time. So if you are stuck and you just can't, you're thinking, oh my gosh, I don't know what kind of lead magnet to go with. Here's what I want you to do. In step one, I want you to research your industry and competitors. Think about what are they using? You're not going to copy what they're doing, but you're going to use this for inspiration and guidance. And then I want you to look outside of your industry.

[00:13:15.750] - Destini
What are other people doing? Is there anything that you could do that you like what they're doing, that you kinda think that you can apply to your own business? And then I want you to pay attention to Facebook and Instagram ads. What are others using for lead magnets to grow their email list? And can you get any inspiration from that? And also just sign up for people's email list. What are their lead magnets look like? And it's not like you're going to copy any of this.

[00:13:44.790] - Destini
You're just going to look at them and you're going to study them. And then I want you to ask yourself, what are the top questions you are asked by your ideal customer? And then think about your customers' biggest pain points. What are their migraines? What are they want to accomplish? How can you help them get there? And then think about what content could you provide that they would say, I can't believe this is free stuff. So you want to make sure that your lead magnet has very high value.

[00:14:19.170] - Destini
Now, here are some tools that you will want to use or that you'll need to have to create your lead magnet. Now you're going to need a Registration and a Thank You page. You can use a tool like LeadPages for that. You are going to need an email service provider. An example of this would be ConvertKit or MailChimp, any of those are fine. You're also going to need most likely some type of design tool I love Canva! It is super easy to use.

[00:14:50.400] - Destini
You can use Canva to create workbooks, cheat sheets, a bunch of different things. You also need a video recording tool, assuming that you're putting together some type of video which that is highly recommended in many cases, and then you may need some other type of other tool like a Google Drive. Let's just say you're delivering some type of spreadsheet, maybe even a budget spreadsheet to them, depending on your lead magnet, you might need some type of Google Drive to deliver any Word, you know, Google Docs or Google Sheets.

[00:15:26.580] - Destini
Now, here's an example of an email nurture sequence. So people are going to see your ad for your free lead magnet, or maybe you're in a Facebook group or you've posted a link for your lead magnet, or maybe you have it on your Instagram account, the link for your landing page. So they're going to go to Facebook or Instagram, they're going to see your link. They're going to go to your landing page for your free lead magnet, and then you're going to have a Thank You page.

[00:15:56.640] - Destini
Now, you may have some type of upsell or tripwire on that at some point in the future, but right now, let's just assume that you have a simple Thank You page and then you're going to add them to your email list and tag them with whatever lead magnet they signed up with. And you're going to deliver that email that lead magnet to them through email. You may have them go into another landing page, where they watch a video. So it depends on how you, what kind of lead magnet, how you would set all of that up.

[00:16:28.830] - Destini
And then you're gonna start your email nurture sequence. Now sometimes, this is called a welcome sequence, but this is one of the most important things you need to set up for your lead magnet. The last thing you want to do is to have them sign up on your list to send them your lead magnet and never follow up with them again. You want to start building that Know, Like and Trust Factor with them. So it is critical that you set up your email nurture sequence!

[00:17:01.110] - Destini

[00:00:03.650] - Liz Stapleton, Host
All right, guys. I'm super excited for this next speaker who has spoken at the summit numerous times. I'm really excited to have her back. She's a certified business growth coach for digital product entrepreneurs. She helps business owners to next their digital product revenue without needing to be glued to their desk, constantly live launching or worrying about social media algorithms. A big warm welcome to Dr. Destini Copp. Destini, thank you so much for coming back.

[00:00:35.240] - Destini Copp
Liz, I'm super excited to be here today and talking about one of the subjects that I am extremely passionate about.

[00:00:42.910] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Yes, I love because you were telling me right before we started recording that you've actually done a six-month research study on this topic. In case you guys missed the title topic, we're talking newsletters. I'm really excited to dive in and find out what you learned from that, where the gaps are. So do you want to explain that study to us real quick, and then we'll get to the questions?

[00:01:04.940] - Destini Copp
Yeah. So I think it'll be important for me to set the stage, if you would, for everybody, and why I actually started going down this path is because I felt like what I was doing and what I had been told all of these years for my newsletter was take your pillar content. For me, that's my podcast. For somebody else, it might be their blog or Maybe they're doing some YouTube videos or whatever. But for me, it was my podcast. So I was taking my podcast, sharing it with my audience, basically having that one call to action in there. And I realized this isn't really doing what it should be doing or what I think it could be doing. And I felt like I was really missing the boat. And one of the reasons when I put my college marketing professor hat on, which I still teach at the university level, I put that hat on. I was like, you know what? I need to think about that customer journey that I'm taking everybody on. And when they get my email newsletter, and they're probably knowing that it's about my podcast, right? Because that's that pillar content that I was sending out.

[00:02:18.780] - Destini Copp
It was like some people were... I was getting decent opens and decent clicks, so that wasn't the issue. But I just felt like I was a little bit wasting my time, if you would, because Just think about what you might be doing if you get that type of email. I know what I was doing when I got an email from somebody that I absolutely loved, and I knew it was about her weekly podcast. So it had nothing to do with her content or her in general, I wasn't opening it. I was actually just deleting it and moving on because I knew it was going to be sitting in my podcast app whenever I wanted to go look at it. I was like, Okay, so if that's the behavior that I'm doing for somebody I absolutely love, obviously this isn't working for me. It's just probably not working for a lot of people who are in this blogging, creator, coaching niche. I was like, I need to really figure this out. And that's when I started that research study, which expanded to six months. I really looked outside of this niche, if you would, in this industry, and looked at other people who I felt like were doing a really good job in this area and looked at what they were doing differently and implemented that in my business.

[00:03:40.690] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Okay. So what are the key elements that differentiate newsletters that are consistently generating revenue and getting opens and clicks and those that don't? I think you touched on the don't where they know exactly what's going to be inside it, why would they open it? But what was working? What was getting people to open? What was making it different?

[00:04:01.270] - Destini Copp
Yeah. So one of the things I noticed when I did this research study was there's obviously different structures to newsletters where people can be successful. Some people are doing these minimalist type newsletters. Some people were doing these really long form type newsletters. Some people were in the middle, if you would. But one thing that I noticed, that I noticed consistently with people and businesses out there that where I knew that they were being successful with it because it was obvious. Number one, a lot of these newsletters had been sold. So it was like a product, a business, just in and of itself, just from that newsletter. So I know that they were making money. I know that there was value in the marketplace for them. A lot of them got purchased by larger, bigger type companies. And one of the things I noticed that they were doing is what I call this magazine type approach to newsletters. I really want to bring everybody back to maybe when they were in high school or somewhere else, and they were waiting for their latest issue of maybe Glamor or Cosmo coming in the mail, and you just were so excited to get it.

[00:05:21.380] - Destini Copp
You ran out to the mailbox, you got it, you opened it up, you'd read it several times, maybe even dog-eared some pages. And What I liked about this newsletter, or this, I should say this magazine approach that a lot of these newsletter operators were doing was it was different sections in their newsletter, so they're breaking it up in different sections. They were monetizing it in different ways. So that was another thing they were doing differently. But one of the things that that newsletter magazine approach allows you to do, or a couple of things that allows you to do, it allows you to basically break up your newsletter. So if you have a section in your newsletter that might not appeal to one person, there's most likely going to be another section that's going to appeal to them. So when you think about my email list and I have a lot of different types of businesses on my email list. I might have bloggers, I might have digital product creators, I might have service providers. All of them want digital products at some point, or maybe they already have them, but there's a lot of nuances, quite frankly, with a lot of that.

[00:06:33.450] - Destini Copp
So tailoring your content and put it in different sections was something that they were doing differently.

[00:06:40.970] - Liz Stapleton, Host
You're not segmenting so that certain people only see certain sections. Everyone can look at all the sections and decide what's right for them.

[00:06:50.150] - Destini Copp
Yeah, they can look at it. People are going to skim, right? Sure. They're just going to open it. They're going to skim it really fast. So you need to make sure that the sections are set up so there's a lot of white space between them, maybe even some dividers. So allow them to skim down there, and they will pick up on what they like. And you can tell what they like by where they're clicking or if they're responding back to you. And when I did the research study and I started making changes in my email newsletter, and I did it over time. So I started testing things and trying to figure out, was this working or was this working? And finally, it really started clicking. And I knew that it was working when I had people that were starting to email me back. And this actually happens almost every single week when they were starting to email me back saying, your emails are so good that I started putting them in a special folder and saving them and going back and reading them later. I'm like, okay, so now I know I've hit the nail on my head that this is actually valuable to people.

[00:07:59.600] - Liz Stapleton, Host
All right. Can you give some examples of sections? Just to get people's wheels turning of what they might include in their newsletter?

[00:08:07.980] - Destini Copp
Yeah. So that's a great question. And what I always do when I'm working with my members in my Newsletter Profit Club on this, I always tell them to think about who's your ideal reader, what are they interested in learning about. So you got to keep them, as you can do everything in your business. So I'm not telling people who are watching this, well, they don't know. But you got to keep that in mind. So it's not all about you and what you're doing, but your ideal reader. And also think about what things are you wanting to promote in your business? So are you wanting to promote your digital products? Are you wanting to promote a membership? Are you wanting to promote a podcast, right? Or your pillar content? You still want people to, How do you feel about that. Are you promoting events and workshops on a regular basis? So basically how I have structured, I can give you a couple of examples here because I run four different newsletters, but I'll give you some B2C examples and B2B examples. So in my B2B business, so I'll just talk about my creator's MBA newsletter. In that, I always have an intro, like a hook, and I might even have a little I'll call it a table of contents, but it's basically, here's what's included in this newsletter.

[00:09:34.220] - Destini Copp
So people can very quickly say, here's what they know what to expect. I have a new episode section for my podcast. I have a section for upcoming events and workshops, because I do on a regular basis, I'm either hosting something, it might be a free training, like tomorrow I'm just doing something off the cuff, just super training, no pitch, that thing. So I might promote stuff like that.

[00:10:01.580] - Liz Stapleton, Host
I might be- You're hopefully promoting this in that section?

[00:10:04.070] - Destini Copp
Yes, absolutely. So in addition to the solo email I might send out for an event that's coming up, I also put it in that section in the newsletter. Just because people don't see everything that you're sending out. So sending it out multiple times, and they know. They expect that to be in my newsletter because it's in there every single week. So they know something. Generally, I don't think I've ever had a week, honestly, in my personal brand, where there's not been anything there. So a featured product, which could be a product that you are promoting. It could be affiliate product. It could be other ways that you're monetizing. Or it could be, sometimes I've had people sponsor my newsletter and paid me to include one of their products or a free lead magnet, and I might put it in that section. Now, I'm always very clear, anything that's been sponsored or paid, you have to, just like you would at a blog post. But you can still, it doesn't have to be-

[00:11:06.840] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Yeah, you just need your disclosure. It's just disclosure for the link. Yeah.

[00:11:12.210] - Destini Copp
Yeah. So that's another section. And then the other two sections that I have in my Creators MBA, I have a quick tips one, my favorite one. And I'll tell you, this is probably where I get the most feedback that people love it. It's called my Bookmark worthy section. And really what I try to put in that section is things that really make people think. It might be forward thinking things that are going on in the industry. Like, for instance, in this past week's newsletter, in that section, I started talking about Custom Chatbots and how you can use those in your courses, in your digital products, in your memberships to help your students get results faster, just like you're sitting next to them as a one-on-one tutor. So that's the stuff I like to include in that bookmark worthy section. And then after that, I just have my outro, and I might have a little checklist, if you would, before you go do this, this, this, this, and this, and then just end it out. In all of my newsletters, I also have, if you want to work with me in my one-on-one coaching, you can apply here to work with me.

[00:12:29.640] - Destini Copp
So So you can include sections like that. So if you're doing coaching or, Here's how you can work with me type things, you can include that also. So that's the B2B top example. And honestly, in my B2C, which is my hobby school brand, in that particular brand, we do online learning, virtual summits, and all kinds of different hobby type niches. And I'm going to think about this for a second, so I hope I don't forget anything. I I do have a podcast there, too, so I have that. I'm also promoting events and workshops, so we do a lot because that audience, they love, love, love, love Summits. So I always like to find ones to promote there. I have a feature product because we have a Shopify store for that brand. So I like to promote the products that we have in the Shopify store. And then also have, I'll call it a get creative prompt. So it can be something related to maybe what we're talking about in the newsletter that particular week. So it might be related to quilting, or I think this past week we were doing a Halloween type email newsletter, so it was related to Halloween.

[00:13:49.620] - Destini Copp
And then I also have a community type section where I might link back to what we're doing in the Facebook group, because that particular brand has a very large and active Facebook group. I might link back to that, say, Come join the conversation here type thing. The same format with the intro and outro and all that good stuff.

[00:14:12.150] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Okay. I like that. It's already giving me idea. I was like, I'm not fully... Because I do have a podcast, too, and I send out the, Here's the new episode, What You'll Learn. But this last week, actually, because I didn't get schedule ahead time, I was like, I have a lot of things I need to tell them. I actually added a bunch of other stuff in. It definitely did better. I was Well, now I need to step this up. So I'm already like, Wait, maybe I can structure this how Destini says. So lots of really good ideas. Okay. I love those layouts. I wanted to follow up. We're talking newsletters. How often should you publish a newsletter when you're trying to market? Like, does frequency affect the earnings? Could you do it more than once a week? Should it just be once a week? Have you dug into that information at all or thoughts?

[00:14:59.500] - Destini Copp
I I will say in that research study that I did, it was all over the board. So I would say that whatever works for you. I recommend a minimum of a once per week, just because people just forget about you, right? So a minimum of once per week. I would say that in general, I don't want to say cross-board, but in general, the brands that we're publishing more than once a week are what I would consider a media type publishers. So they have a whole team of people working on this stuff. I'm just one person, right? So it would be almost impossible for me to do what I do in my Sunday email newsletters to do it more than once a week. Now, it doesn't mean I'm not sending out other emails. This week, I did my Sunday newsletter. I am promoting a summit also. So I did my solo email that went out today. So I'm still sending multiple emails, but that weekly newsletter, it takes me... In my personal brand, I calculated it this past Sunday because I was so late doing it. And I sat down at 6:30 in the morning. I started working on it.

[00:16:13.290] - Destini Copp
I got done at 8:30. So it It's going to be two hours to do that. I can really only do that once per week. Sure.

[00:16:19.180] - Liz Stapleton, Host
I like it. And just did the day matter? Do you think it matters what day your weekly newsletter is coming out if you're managing once a week, or just be consistent with whatever day you choose?

[00:16:29.290] - Destini Copp
I would just say Be consistent and just test it out with your audience and see what appeals to them. I just landed on Sunday's just because that was, honestly, it was easier for me, and I felt like they were getting a good amount of opens and engagement. I'm just sitting with that right now.

[00:16:48.000] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Okay. And within those sections, are you repurposing content that you've done before so it's not new material every time, or is it, at least for now, new each time?

[00:16:59.880] - Destini Copp
So that's a great question. I would say that for the most part, it's new material. Now, that being said, in Hobby School this past week, the podcast episode that we did, it was a It was like a paranormal investigator type episode. And I was doing a Halloween email newsletter. I'm like, Oh, my gosh, this podcast would be perfect. So I did repurpose that and did it again. And who cares? People Nobody remembers. So if you want to repurpose, repurpose. But I will say one thing I have not been doing as much, but I am absolutely going to start doing this going forward, is taking a lot of this juicy content that I am publishing in my email newsletter and also repurposing that on social media. I've done it here and there. Haven't been super consistent with it just because I've been so busy. But 2025, I'm going to start getting very more, I guess, focused on social media than I have been in the past. So that's one of my goals is to take a lot of this juicy content that I have published already in my email newsletters and repurpose that on social media.

[00:18:16.500] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Okay. Next question. How are you tracking and measuring the success of the newsletters, whether that's in terms of revenue generation? Are there other metrics you're really looking at? How are you gaging the success?

[00:18:30.550] - Destini Copp
So some of it's replies. People are emailing me back saying, Oh, I got one. I actually got one this morning. I sent out that one of the emails, got an email back, and I felt like this was written just for me. You really this resonated with me type email. So replies are very important because if somebody... And that was a nonprofit reply. If somebody sends you something like that back, you know that whatever you did is really hitting home. Those I love. I do share. So I do track the share. So I'm in the spark loop for my personal brand. I'm in that. So you can track people's shares, and they get some gifts back depending on how they share. I may be butchering some of that. I'm also in the creator network, so I do track that, too.

[00:19:31.770] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Do you make these public for your creator network page?

[00:19:35.970] - Destini Copp
I do. All of my email newsletters, anybody can go for Hobby School, my personal brand, even the other newsletters that I do that are public. Anybody can go see those.

[00:19:50.750] - Liz Stapleton, Host
In case you guys are wondering, we're talking about Convert kit. I use Convert kit as well, which is why it's familiar. But anyone's like, What are you talking about? Creator Network, and this is a feature of Convert kit.

[00:20:00.060] - Destini Copp
Yes. So there is a way to go out where you can publish them to the web. Some people actually may test this in the future. Some people actually take their newsletter content and publish them as a blog on their website. Now, I have not done that. I did see that in the research study. So I can't really, since I haven't tried it myself, I haven't tested it. I can't really speak to the effectiveness of it. But some people are doing that. So I don't know. The other things I look at, of course, no surprise here, right? Open rates, click-through rates. Click-through rates are important. I do a lot of sponsorships. So in the Hobby School brand, somebody might pay me to promote one of their workshops, or I might send out a total email that's strictly focused on promoting one of their webinars or whatever. So I have to really pay close attention to click-through rates. That's the main thing that they're focused on for that.

[00:21:06.050] - Liz Stapleton, Host
And are you just relying on the data from Convert kit? Are you using UTMs? Are you using anything like that to help measure?

[00:21:14.350] - Destini Copp
I do have UTM set up, but I am primarily looking at the Convert kit data. But I do have all the UTM set up and Google Analytics and all that good stuff.

[00:21:26.130] - Liz Stapleton, Host
All right. No, I like that. Okay. I have two more questions. I'll wrap up. First of all, what are some mistakes you see people making with their newsletters? Not just in terms of content, but just things that could maybe be hurting their open rights, or just what should people avoid doing? I feel like as much as it's important to learn what to do, it's just as important to learn what not to do. And so any feedback you have there?

[00:21:51.630] - Destini Copp
Yeah, I would say spend a good amount of time on your subject line. I use AI to help me with that. I don't completely rely on AI. What I would generally do, once I've gotten my entire newsletter written, I will upload that into Claude. You could do Claude, ChatGPT. Sometimes I'll test them both to see if which one comes up better. So I'll upload it in that. I'll say, Can you give me 20 plus email subject lines and give me some variety? Include some questions in there include some suspensful titles, like YouTube type titles. Those tend to work very well if you can get in in that. Give me some without columns. All the AI loves to use the columns all the time. There's other things you can put in there. Just give me some variety, maybe include some emojis. See what it comes back with. I'll generally will pick a few that I like, and then I'll go back and say, Can you rate these? I out of 10? And just let it go through and rank them for you and see which ones they think the AI might think perform better. I can tell you the ones I think might perform, the AI is generally better at predicting that.

[00:23:16.460] - Destini Copp
The other tool that I use is subjectlines.Com. So that's a tool that I use. I love that tool. It works very well, too. So I spend a good amount of time on the subject lines and the preview text.

[00:23:32.020] - Liz Stapleton, Host
I do think preview text is underutilized by a lot of people. Even me, I will say the only time I ever really remember to do it is when I'm sending out an affiliate email because I don't want the preview to be the affiliate disclosure, which is oftentimes first in my newsletter to make sure that it's compliant, but I should do a better job at using it in general for every single e-mail I send out. That was just my thought. Okay, so Anything else you feel like people should know in terms of creating newsletters that are going to earn them money every time they sell them out?

[00:24:09.010] - Destini Copp
Going back to what I said earlier, think about how you want to monetize your newsletter. The other thing that you may not be thinking about today is sponsorships. There are websites that you can go out, like passionfroot.Me, and it's spelled passionf-r-o-o-t.Me. You can go out there, input your newsletter information, and find sponsors. People go to you. I've had people contact me, especially for my hobby school list, because it's a sizable list, and they're definitely wanting to get in front of that particular audience. So think about sponsorship. There's a lot of different ways that you can make money from your email newsletter that you may not be considering today. So Super easy ways.

[00:25:01.960] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Yeah. I know with Convertit, you can get into the network to get paid for recommending people as well. So there's newsletter monetization is evolving quite a lot, I feel like in the last year or so. And I think we're going to see just more and more of it in 2025. All right, Destini, thank you so much for sharing all this knowledge. Do you have something for attendees you want them to go check out? Where should they find you? All that jazz.

[00:25:26.220] - Destini Copp
Yeah, absolutely. I have my newsletter profit calculator. If you want to input your newsletter information, it's a Google Sheet. You can input your newsletter information in it, and it will basically estimate how much you can earn through each newsletter that you send out. So you can go to destinicopp.Com/calculator and grab that. And just my website is destinicopp.Com. Definitely the best place or the best place to get all the juicy tips that I send out is my email newsletter that we've been talking about all day today. So definitely jump on that.

[00:26:06.560] - Liz Stapleton, Host
All right, guys. And the links for that are going to be below. Make sure you check that out. I think that's the same as me. I will email consistently, no matter what. Me on social media, I'm going to get better this year. I really am. But if you want to hear from Destini for sure, definitely make sure to sign for a newsletter. I feel like I need to go sign up. It sounds really good. Again, Destini, thank you so much for coming back. I really appreciate it.

[00:26:27.310] - Destini Copp
Thanks so much, Liz, for having me.

**Transcript:**
Liz Stapleton [00:00:00]:
Alright, guys. Today, we're going to be talking about a particular type of funnel with Drew DuBuff. Drew, welcome. Thank you so much for for being here and sharing this knowledge.

Drew DuBuff [00:00:11]:
Thank you so much for having me, Liz.

Liz Stapleton [00:00:13]:
Yeah. So we're gonna talk about quiz funnels, which I feel Everyone's probably done without realizing it, like, like, participated in, you know, not necessarily set one up themselves, but have participated in without realizing it. and it can be a really great tool. Can you so give us a little bit about how you kinda got back got into this, your background, and what we're gonna be covering today.

Drew DuBuff [00:00:36]:
Sure. So when I first started my journey into online business, I wanted, to start a career blog. career advice block. And so that's what I had started. In the process, I ended up, freelancing for some figure and 7 figure bloggers, which gave me a career in freelancing, and made me realize that I wanted to help educate people more about online business than career advice. But I had this quiz that I had created as one of my first three posts as a part of the career blog, and that quiz still performs amazingly well today. And it's gotten it's generated over, 1700 leads, since September of, I I wanna say it was

Liz Stapleton [00:01:24]:
2018.

Drew DuBuff [00:01:25]:
so just about a a year and a few months, and it's done that completely organically on Pinterest with no advertising. I haven't pinned it in over a year. so it's a system that I think is very receptive to social media. And I love how interactive quizzes are because you get to, you know, personalize and customize your results. And that's great for email marketing and segmentation and, you know, as a business owner, you can recommend products based on who, you know, that avatar is. So that's really why I love quizzes. And you you've probably seen them. They can also be called assessments, That's another fun word. You see people like Michael Hyatt have their life score assessment and, you know, he's generated 1000 of thousands of leads for his launches, through quizzes. so it's a great system, I think, for online business owners to generate qualified leads.

Liz Stapleton [00:02:27]:
Okay. Yeah. Because it's I mean, you're like you said, it kind of lets them self segment from the get go, which is -- Yes. -- great at, you know, because the more targeted you can be in your emails, the more success you're gonna see for sure. Yes. Okay. So I definitely have questions about this. I'm excited to dig in. I'm gonna let you take the lead and I will just interjective questions.

Drew DuBuff [00:02:49]:
Awesome. So I think the first question I want to address is, you know, why would you want to do a quiz funnel? Because You know, if you've never done a quiz before, you don't understand, you know, the why of it. And so I think for me, one of the biggest, reasons why I like quizzes is that it helps to segment your email audience. and this can be used at different times of the funnel, right, So you might do do something at the top of the funnel where you just wanna know what different people are, interested in. So, you know, for example, on that career quiz, I had, you know, if someone wanted to be a lifetime employee or they wanted to be a part time employee and start side hustle or be an online entrepreneur, there are different ways that you can go, and the answers would require different email sequences. So it helps the segment at the top of the funnel. Later in the funnel, you know, it can also help to qualify people for certain programs. So someone signs up to your list and you might say, hey. You know, I've got, you know, a quiz that will help you figure out, you know, what your biggest you know, struggle is right now. Maybe that's Pinterest traffic or maybe that's Google traffic. And whatever that sort of result is you can then send, you know, an email based upon their results. So it's really email segmentation, I think, is the is one of the big benefits, in many different aspects. You can also, use quizzes simply for affiliate marketing and, you know, where, say, you're a blogger in personal finance, and you are an affiliate for 5 to 10 different survey companies. And you could, you know, create a quiz that then recommends which, you know, survey company somebody should go based on how much money they wanna make the time that they're willing to invest in it. So there are a lot of different options when it comes to quizzes. And because they're so, viral and so share worthy, when you look at companies like -- Well,

Liz Stapleton [00:04:59]:
you put them together. Right. They are.

Drew DuBuff [00:05:01]:
Yeah. So when you put together

Liz Stapleton [00:05:03]:
-- I have them with 4 affiliate marketing, what I did 1 year, used in 2018 is I created a quiz of, you know, for Genius Blogger's Toolkit because it can be so overwhelming with all the products. So I created a quiz of, like, is it right for you? And if so, these are the first products you should dive into. And, you know, the value of them is over what the, you know, and so I went through it on, like, your beginner, you wanna on these ones. And they're, you know, it was possibly you were gonna get a result. I was like, you know, I don't think I think you should pass. You know? but I did that. And I I mean, I saw some, it was mostly people from my list and stuff that I'd sent to it that did well, but it didn't, like, it definitely didn't have any virality to it.

Drew DuBuff [00:05:40]:
Yeah. And I think when you look at something like the Genius Bloggers Toolkit, that's got a very limited shelf life. Yeah. And so it's only gonna work for, you know, for a limited period of time. when you do something that's more evergreen, you know, the promotion can exist for much longer. and people naturally want to share their results, especially if you could if you create a quiz that's kind of brag worthy or, you know, you do like in a like, an assessment kind when it's like, I got, you know, x, you know, out of 100. And,

Liz Stapleton [00:06:13]:
you

Drew DuBuff [00:06:13]:
know, people like to show off on social media. especially Facebook. that's so much on Pinterest, but, that's it. It's a great way to, you know, encourage people to so actually share, which brings more awareness and free publicity. And you could even counter that if you did decide to pay, to advertise your quiz, which I haven't done yet. All these results are organic. but it's definitely an option.

Liz Stapleton [00:06:38]:
Definitely. Yeah. No. I I like the idea of doing it evergreen. I'm already with those couple examples you gave, I'm already, like, thinking of ideas Oh, I could. You know?

Drew DuBuff [00:06:47]:
Yeah. Yes.

Liz Stapleton [00:06:49]:
But, yeah. Okay. So how so that's kinda how you got certain why you like them. but how do you actually, you know, decide on a quiz? You know, because there's a lot that goes into it. Like, it's one thing to take quiz, another to build it out and the, like, you know, calculations of how they get what results. So how do you go about that? How do you sort of decide what your quiz is gonna be on?

Drew DuBuff [00:07:12]:
I think the first thing that you have to look at is what what's your objective with the quiz? Is it to get an affiliate sale? Is it to promote your own products? Is it, you know, to segment your audience by interests? And then you can work, you know, around that. way. so for example, you know, if you blog about side hustles, you might wanna create what we call, like, a branching logic quiz where you branch people into different apps based on the answers that they give at each stage, you know, that could result in, you know, bookkeeping or that could result in, a virtual assistant or freelance writing, then you could send personalized results that way. That kind of a quiz, you'd you'd you'd know what the objective is. You're gonna push an affiliate offer or helpful guides on your blog. And so then you'd be like, you know, what kind of side hustle, you know, should you pursue? But maybe you'll make it a little more, fun to play with and, you know, play on different archetypes. And I don't necessarily not necessarily stereo types, but typical behavior patterns, and you could say, you know, like, design a red carpet dress, and we'll tell you your new side hustle. Right? Something that's much more fun, and you could still make those parallels, like someone who might like a more structured dress might be better you know, for accounting because there's, you know, it's very linear like that. You know, someone, that likes to have fun and is very visual might be better, you know, as a Pinterest VA. So you can toy with your quiz, conception, and ideas based on the outcome that you want. And so it really works best to start from the end first and then work your way backwards. And I would actually write you know, your, at least your initial results. It doesn't have to be the full results page, but know where you want to go because then that will determine the kind of quiz that you want to create.

Liz Stapleton [00:09:15]:
Okay. No. I like that, and I still need to create a side hustle quiz from my other site.

Drew DuBuff [00:09:21]:
Don't steal my ideas.

Liz Stapleton [00:09:23]:
I have. And I did a whole summit on side hustles for that site, though. I'm like, I could just lead them to the particular session of the summit.

Drew DuBuff [00:09:31]:
Yeah. It it it really it it's a concept that I think really works.

Liz Stapleton [00:09:34]:
Yes. For sure. I promise. So it'll be different from yours.

Drew DuBuff [00:09:38]:
Yeah. Yes.

Liz Stapleton [00:09:40]:
I'm not looking at it from for affiliate things. Anyway, okay. So I did wanna ask. We'll we'll dig into setting it up more in a second, but you mentioned full results page. So what does a full results page look like? Like, what all are you including on that? Do you and kind of a joint question, do you require the email address before they see the results page?

Drew DuBuff [00:10:00]:
That's a that's a great question. And I think a lot of it depends on what you want your results to be and what you want the objective of the quiz to be. I personally ask, for the email before the results because they're invested in the process And so chances are they wanna know what the result is. I also, I currently on that on my career quiz, I don't ask for, a first name. I just want the email address because the more that you ask for, of course, there can always be a dropout rate. But, it's okay to ask for a first name and an email. I just wouldn't ask for more than that. but I I -- You

Liz Stapleton [00:10:40]:
already have the quiz data.

Drew DuBuff [00:10:43]:
Yes.

Liz Stapleton [00:10:43]:
Right? Because cert certain quiz tools can let you actually tag people based on what they did in the quiz. Right?

Drew DuBuff [00:10:50]:
Yes. Exactly. and so some quiz builders have free options where they won't allow you to collect emails. That's kind of a limitation. but a workaround that you could do is include something like an opt in form on an announcement bar in your site, and then they could say take the quiz, and they've already subscribed. So you could do it that way. You just wouldn't be able to personalize their you wouldn't be able to segment them because if you're not collecting subscribers, you

Liz Stapleton [00:11:17]:
can't segment.

Drew DuBuff [00:11:18]:
Yeah. So it really does, work best, I think, before the results. But in terms of the results pages themselves, I've seen anywhere from short results pages to longer results pages, you know, if you're taking if you're doing a quiz that is going to be more fun in nature and it's going to be short like, that career quiz that I have, you know, it's gonna have a shorter results page just because people wanna know. They wanna know a little bit about themselves, and then they're done with it. I'm trying to sell them on anything. I just want them to sign up for my list to be, you know, aware of these things. it you do get to put, like, a button, a CTA call to action button. So if you have, like, an opt in, you know, that you wanted them to see tailored based on the results. You could put that there. and then what I do is you can set up goals in Google analytics to track you know, the the number of conversions that you get, from people who are, you know, clicking

Liz Stapleton [00:12:18]:
-- -- session on that?

Drew DuBuff [00:12:20]:
Yeah. Yeah. Fun. Cool beans. so that's, yeah, so that's great. and there are also more long form results pages, almost like, to the length of sales pages because some people, you know, the way that their quiz is set up is they really want to get you to know them. Like, this is your virtual introduction a lot of times if it's the top of your funnel, And so if you know who your reader is, then you can personalize it and, you know, really expand upon know, the results of that. So while, you know, you might not wanna write that much about a survey because they just wanna sign the survey and start making money, you know, if you are doing, you know, like, a a side hustle, you might want to expand on what being a virtual bookkeeper is. And, you know, the fact that you don't actually need to know tax law that you just need to be able to manage you know, books and to do calculations and things like that. So it it you can take an educational perspective and make it long form if it's if it if it's right. And it won't be right in every time. So you have that flexibility with quizzes that I really like.

Liz Stapleton [00:13:34]:
So let's go ahead and dive into sort of, like, setting one up in different tools you can use. and if you don't mind screen sharing, like, an example or something we can kinda dig into that stuff.

Drew DuBuff [00:13:46]:
Yeah. Sure. so I personally, I use a company that's called, Interact. there are a few different kinds of, companies, and I'll have, a link for an exclusive coupon through there if you do want to get started. but there are a few other companies, companies like, lead quizzes and bucket IO. I just find that, interact is really friendly, for bloggers. And that's kind of why I like it. It allows for email segmentation right within, you know, the results page and the quiz builder itself. So it it's simple. And I think it's very, user friendly, and that's really why I like it. so, yeah, so we can absolutely check out, that quiz. And we can show you kind of what the anatomy of the quiz would be. Does that sound good?

Liz Stapleton [00:14:43]:
Yes. Let's do it.

Drew DuBuff [00:14:45]:
Perfect. So let me share my screen. Alrighty. So we should be. So right here. So can you see this, this quiz right here?

Liz Stapleton [00:14:55]:
I can. Yes.

Drew DuBuff [00:14:56]:
Perfect. So, as you can see here, you just got a simple title, at the top. And then share buttons are always helpful so people can, share your results. as you can see, this has been shared close to a hundred times on, Pinterest from here. and then what I have here is the quiz is embedded. it does have a bunch of bottom, but that's for mobile users so that doesn't cut off. You don't have to scroll, which I think really helps. And then, I have branding at the bottom. some quiz builders on the free plans won't allow you to customize the branding, but It's an option for more of the, the paid plans. Yes. you get a simple, title. I I think that simple works best unless if you're trying to do something fun, you know, like I was saying about, you know, design a red carpet dress, you know, and we'll tell you x, y, z. Yeah. Something simple, something readable. You can have a nice image here. and then you've got this little description and this can work well when you're promoting it on social media as well. it can be like the copy. You know, so I have does your job frustrate you. You might not be realizing your potential. Take the quiz to discover your true career best. Yeah. So just a few sentences. You don't want it to be too long. and then you'll have the button to start the quiz. And it's nice to have, like, a customized CTA button, like, you don't just wanna say, you know, start here or take the quiz, you know, create something enticing. So I have Discover my desk today. any questions so far on the title description?

Liz Stapleton [00:16:44]:
No. I think that's great.

Drew DuBuff [00:16:46]:
Great. so after this, you'll get, questions. And there'll be this little progress tracking bar at the at the top here. I find that's helpful for people because that allows them to see, you know, how far along so they don't quit. because I'm sure you've taken quizzes from Facebook that were, like, 30 questions, and you just want it to end and get your result. And it doesn't. So this helps you to track it. And in general, I would try to not have more than 15 questions. I find that, like, 7 to

Drew DuBuff [00:17:22]:
10

Drew DuBuff [00:17:22]:
is really a great, a great number. And you can, you know, of course, if your topic requires more questions, because you're trying to personalize it more, then that's fine. Just understand that people might drop off, you know, if the quiz is too long. So 7 to 10, I think, is the sweet spot. So then what we have here, you'll see is some images. You have the option to do images or just text or text and images. I like the text and images, but you can definitely break it up. because of, like, the columns, you know, if you wanted to do just text and have the results be or the answers sees me, be slightly longer, I would avoid, you know, images because then it will look very, like, ""column-y"", and it will know, be hard to read on mobile because that's really, like, a lot of people are taking quizzes on mobile, so you wanna optimize it for mobile. but these are simple answers, you know, what matters to you most, happiness, money, job satisfaction, and these lead in to the results that I have. What's important, to note here is that the first question and the last question generally considered more important in terms of the quiz anatomy and making sure that you get the most important questions asked answered that you want. so the last, you know, the last question before people wanna know the results. And so they think that's the question you know, that's gonna give them the right result. and then in the beginning, this can help really help you, with understanding what your audience is interested in. because based on those results, you could, you know, create content based on what the majority of your people are interested in. So, it'll go through, a very similar, path here. you know, do you wanna be your own boss? And I, you know, you can create, you know, text that and copy that fits for your audience. And that's important. You know, if you phrase where it's a certain way. If you use a certain style or look of images, include that. It should this is an extension of your brand. but this is all stock photography, right here. I don't have anything. Nothing costs them. and you should really if you are including images, they should be tailored to your avatar. So for example, the majority of my audience is going to be women. That's kind of a fact of nature on Pinterest. It's the similar on, Facebook. So the majority of my images are going to be of women. you know, in the same way that if you're targeting moms including fathers is probably not the best image choice. You want to, include images that your readers can relate to. And if they see emotions, then that can help guide them in their decision making process. So simple questions, things like this. and you can absolutely include more than 3, you know, 3 answers. I think you can do, I think, like, maybe 6 might be the maximum. but don't overwhelm you, your, quiz takers with the number of results that you have. You know, I find that keeping it simple works the best. If you have a lot of results, like, as I was mentioning with the freelance side hustle sort of thing, you'd wanna do a branching logic quiz. And that is very similar to this kind of personality quiz, except that each question that you ask get asked kind of takes you down like a branch.

Liz Stapleton [00:21:11]:
So you get different questions depending on how you answer the question.

Drew DuBuff [00:21:14]:
Exactly. Yes. So you can have 7 to 10 questions in a branching logic quiz that will result in something so much more personalized than trying to ask 15 to 20 questions to get a majority result to pop you into the right box it. Yeah. so but it can definitely help. Like, if you, you know, this quiz has, 4 results. So I thought that 3, 3 would work pretty well because there are some overlap. the move a lap. And if you do 4, it'll just kind of look awkward with, like, the 4th one.

Liz Stapleton [00:21:50]:
Yeah. Yeah.

Drew DuBuff [00:21:51]:
So keep it relative to screen size and, you know, and mobile and, you know, you people might miss options if they don't see that at the bottom. So I find that keeping it simple works. and so how do you define success? You know, having a family that loves me, finding my purpose, flying 1st class, you know, like, this very much appeals to someone who wants to be a CEO because they want that, you know, rich luxury life and, you know, having a family that loves me, you know, that might appeal to someone who wants to, you know, be a part time employee or start a side hustle so they can spend time with their baby. You know, so the images really do help to tell a story and they can help you correlate your, you know, your results, to there. and so you're gonna go through on a similar path as you take your quiz, so some people might say they're the next Lady Gaga. they've known what their dream job is since elementary school. You know, you can have fun. And so after this, you'll get, this page right here, and that's what we are talking about about, you know, the opt in before the results. and you can customize this copy right here. So you'll say, you know, you'll get personalized advice and access to an amazing library of free resources that every young professional needs. And I like saying something other than email address. You know, it could be best, you know, email or your business email or your favorite email. Something so that people don't automatically default to their subscription slash junk email just to do it. So this helps put your, your content into the right box. And so if we, do this, and we put in an email. And, again, with the customized copy right here on the button, find out my destiny. So then you'll do that. And so the answer that we got here was, part time professional. So you've got the top right here. When you share when you go to share it, it'll say, like, you got colon, you know, before the result, you don't want to include that in the actual result itself. otherwise, it'll be redundant on social media. but then you can include a nice image here. their share results. they quiz builders often include some sort of sharing embeddable widget y like things within the builder. It's self. I also have these outside because at this time, interact doesn't have a Pinterest button within their builder. I've mentioned it to them, and they said that they'd bring it up and, you know, discuss on it because I said, you know, I work with a lot of bloggers and bloggers use Pinterest. it can also help to have the quiz hosted on your site, you know, to have those Pinterest sharing, buttons. But then right here, you, can include, you know, congratulations. You're a part time professional. And this is kind of when I got to have some fun. So back when I was in college, I did a thesis on positive and negative framing on results pages for quizzes. and it was a lot of fun. definitely stressful. But what I'll say is that people tend to identify and share your results more when you frame it positively than when you frame it negatively. And so that's why it, you know, it might be a little more troublesome, you know, when you're doing, like, an assessment score and someone scores, you know, 0 25 because you're like, well, yeah. Exactly. So that's why I think that, like, personality quizzes tend to perform better. for bloggers, instead of, like, you know, well, how how much, you know, German, you know, history knowledge do you know? You know, like, this tends to work a little better. so you can have the same sort of editing options that you would have in WordPress or Squarespace or whatever your CMS is. You can do bold. You can do numbers. you know, and then this is when you can personalize it. So, you know, you have a family to take care of, so you need flexible hours. you know, cuts down on transportation costs, working from your home, here are some ideas, start a blog, work as a virtual assistant, become a freelance writer, and then I have here, you know, are you ready to ditch the traditional work schedule? Download my free side hustle checklist and work the hours you want to. Make sure you check your email inbox for instructions on how to access it, download my checklist, and that would take you to the opt in itself. And I host that right on WordPress so you can, you know, easily, navigate to it. Keep it something simple. Just, you know, a page, maybe two pages. you know, if you're doing a more long form quiz, then it might be helpful if you've got a whole persona built out and you wanted to, you know, refer someone to a

Liz Stapleton [00:26:57]:
10

Drew DuBuff [00:26:57]:
page, but that's fine. Yeah. but, you know, it's all gonna gonna depend on your objectives. So that's, quizzes in a nut shell. And I think something exciting is to then check out, you know, well, what does what are the analytics options

Liz Stapleton [00:27:16]:
and how -- -- end up having a quiz look like?

Drew DuBuff [00:27:19]:
Exactly. so right here, as you can see, I've got my for your destiny quiz. And we've got, the analytics. And so I think it's very, very, easy to navigate this. they've got a nice funnel, so you can literally see the funnel. and as you can tell, this quiz has, converted it at above 30% over the span of the year. And I think in terms of opt ins, that does pretty darn well for cold traffic.

Liz Stapleton [00:27:50]:
Yes.

Drew DuBuff [00:27:51]:
Cold traffic as ice cold as you can get. so I think that works really well. And so then you can see here based on the results, how many people, you know, are are opting in, you know, to each of these. And so I can say, oh, you know, part time professional, you know, that's, something that a lot of people are doing. Let me create more content, you know, in that arena And you can even, go and you can look at the different questions that people have answered. So you can see happiness. A lot of people think happiness matters to the most. so you might say, oh, you know, how did you might do a post on, you know, how to stay happy, you know, as a full time employee. Something simple like that. It would do well on Pinterest. And it's, you know, based on what your users, you know, have said that they want. So I think, you know, that's really, you know, when you get to have fun.

Liz Stapleton [00:28:51]:
they're inadvertently asking for?

Drew DuBuff [00:28:54]:
Yes. Exactly. And so you can see, like, the the level of engagement, you can see when people are, dropping off, you can see that dropping off is in the totals. so people are always going to drop off. I think it's helpful to see, you know, what people are saying. but that's kind of the the the gist of the analytics is really to show you this. And you can filter this based on different stuff. There's even an, advanced tab, if it'll it'll work or not? maybe maybe it'll work. I don't know. maybe it doesn't wanna work today. But, there it is. Okay. It's a fun little data, and you can see, like, where your conversion rate is over the the period of time when you know, a lot of people are opting in the number of events. So it's fun to do. It can be a little overwhelming with over a year as the That's the range, but over a span of a month or so, it can really help, for you to do that. So now if we just go in, to the actual

Liz Stapleton [00:30:02]:
-- Set up.

Drew DuBuff [00:30:04]:
Yeah. Yeah. The actual setup. and we're going to edit it. So you're gonna go directly into the, the builder. And you can create from scratch or use a template. And one of the reasons why I love interact is because they've got, like, hundreds of templates already done in different niches. So if you were a yoga blogger and you wanted to talk about you know, yoga poses, chances are there something similar or, you know, if you're a health and wellness coach, there are quizzes on, you know, shockras and things like that, and you can customize them.

Liz Stapleton [00:30:39]:
Yeah. It's always easier to start with something on the page than a blank page.

Drew DuBuff [00:30:43]:
Exactly.

Liz Stapleton [00:30:44]:
-- completely rewrite everything that was on that page. It's still easier to approach it, I think.

Drew DuBuff [00:30:49]:
Yes. The setup's done. Yeah. And that's that's, I think, that that's great. So as you can see here, we've got the cover page. You can do the title, the image, the description, and the button text. Simple. you know, nothing is overly complicated. And they've even got little, information tags here that will, you know, tell you on, like, what you know, how to write, you know, a personality quiz, and things like that. So they they share with you advice from their users' experiences, which I think can really help you in the beginning. Yeah. And, in the results, you know, you can redirect the results. You can reorder the results. You know, this is personality quiz. So, this is what, you know, if you're a future CEO, you've got all of the text right here, you can customize the button, the URL, the color. it it really has everything that you would need, and it's fairly straight forward. And that's what I like. And so when you click on a question, you know, you can add answers. You can edit. You can, use text answers, answer settings. This is a fun one. So this is like the result correlations. And this is, you know, when we're talking about mapping people, This is how they get to the results. and so you can easily drag and drop these and so I've got here, you know, like, I think people, you know, happiness is gonna correlate more to that. And, you know, I find that, you know, online entrepreneurs tend to have more job satisfaction and no suit or lifetime employees because they're in it in their company. And so you can, you know, continue on this process. And the same, and it's a similar feature if you're doing a scored quiz where it's like, you know, 0 to 100, you know, you can assign points and your results would be, you know, out of so and so, and that's already done for you. And so I think it's very simple, you know, to correlate these two things together, which I think is amazing because as a blogger, you don't wanna have the hassle of not figuring out the tech. It's, like, always a major issue. And, you know, if the tech looks straightforward, then that's better. branching logic quizzes, little more complicated, mainly because of the branches. And I think they're even on, a higher paid plan just because they're more complicated to execute. but what I find is really helpful. instead of doing this sort of stuff on the fly, map it out in a word document or on a whiteboard or on a piece of paper and know the different questions and where they're gonna correlate to so that when it comes time to build the quiz, you can just pop right in here and assign things and be on your merry way. And I think that's a much better system than doing it on the fly because then chances are you'll screw things up.

Liz Stapleton [00:33:51]:
Yeah. And I think just seeing the visual thing before you try to build it out, kind of draw it in the way your brain works as it moves the way the the whatever software you're using works will help you make sure you don't miss anything.

Drew DuBuff [00:34:04]:
Exactly. And so that's, how the quiz looks. It's what the quiz looks like. you know, the branding, you can edit this on, the paid plan. You can do conversion tracking. If it were branching logic, you could do that. the social sharing settings, if that all works.

Liz Stapleton [00:34:24]:
email marketing settings with map quiz. Yeah.

Drew DuBuff [00:34:27]:
So, if you wanna hide them, you can do the ones, the above, you know, where you wanna put the social share buttons, the social sharing link. So, you know, if, you embed your quiz, you can do that there. interact will also host quizzes on their servers. If you'd rather do just like a simple landing page, they have that as an option. And then you can also customize your image, try to use one that attracts attention. and, you know, you can, customize, you know, your results and I got and, you know, and things like that. And they tell you how they typically structure it. And a lot of this is very, straightforward. And then, you know, you got to the fun stuff. So I use ConvertKit, for my business. I really like it, and it's It's set up very well. and so you have the flexibility, you know, so, the trigger, you know, so when they get the quiz result of future CEO actions, you know, add them to the sequence of, you know, the free resource library. or, you know, if you were personalizing this further, you could have them do a specific, you know, sequence on becoming a CEO and how to up level in your industry and and things like that. You have that flexibility. Since this quiz is more off brand from my current audience. I don't customize it as much. but it still performs very well. And you can do this for each one. You know, and I think that's the important part is you could create, you know, a customized sequence for each result. and you don't have to worry about doing complicated rules or automations in your email marketing provider, it will just automatically add them to the which I think is nice. And you could even send them an introductory email that says, hey. This is your result. I'm gonna introduce you to me, you know, over the next few days, but I just wanted to let you know in case you, you know, skipped away, too quickly. and then you could send them all the same, you know, the same, about me sequence after that. And so you've just got, you know, this, you know, the quiz result as the intro coming down into the same automation. So it's something simple, but it personalizes the results further. And I think that's really, you know, the the amazing thing about this is how you know, easy it is to execute. You know, you just create these things and, you know, you do it right within the builder. No hassle, no tech involved. And you can also do, you know, custom fields, and that's a little more advanced stuff. But if you wanted to know, for example, you know, that someone was a beginner blogger or an intermediate blogger, an advanced blogger, you could, you know, those custom fields in the quiz, and then they could be embedded into your email marketing providers. So you could then send tailored content based on people who are identified themselves as beginner bloggers and conditional content. And it opens this whole wide range of email marketing opportunities that come from building the quiz. And I think that's really exciting.

Liz Stapleton [00:37:42]:
Yeah. No. I I like that a lot. I don't wanna be respectful of your time, but any kind of final tips you would, like, to to like, to add and then we'll we'll tell them a little more about the the offer you got for that.

Drew DuBuff [00:37:54]:
Yes. quiz promotion. Get your quiz on Pinterest. Get your quiz on Facebook. It doesn't have to be organic, but create a pin, you know, share it in your group boards, maybe your tribes, yes, of the quiz itself, the landing page. because as you can see right here, when you type in career Destiny, My quiz is front and center. It's the first result. I haven't pinned this that much. It beats promoted pins. And here it is right here, my quiz. And that brings in a ton of free organic Pinterest traffic, and it's not going anywhere. It's been here forever, and ever. So I think that's really great. And Pinterest users love quizzes. They wanna be engaged by the content. So if you create a good image, they will engage. And that's what brings them into your funnel. You know, so look at these different social media sources as, you know, the ways to get them into your funnel and advertise where and promote where your audience exists.

Liz Stapleton [00:39:04]:
Mhmm.

Drew DuBuff [00:39:04]:
And I think that's, you know, that's that's how you do it.

Liz Stapleton [00:39:08]:
Okay. Yeah. No. I I think that's great advice. We have sessions on Pinterest and stuff as part of the summit as well, and Facebook ads and things like that. So definitely check out those other sessions. And I think you got all the attendees, or it's something that anyway, a discount for, the the quiz tool you use. Is that correct?

Drew DuBuff [00:39:28]:
That is correct. Yes. so there will be an exclusive coupon code that you will be able to follow, if you do the landing page that, Liz is going to provide. And

Liz Stapleton [00:39:42]:

**Transcript:**
Jamie Bright [00:00:11]:
Back in July, I created a brand new lead magnet that consistently has been bringing in 1 to $2,000 sales from brand new email subscribers, and it's completely automated. It's only email. There's no DMs, no hard selling, no Facebook lives, no nothing other than just email. It's absolutely beautiful, and that's what I'm gonna be telling you about today. For a few years prior to that, I had been focused mostly on building my mastermind and doing high ticket 1 on 1 sales. I got to a point last summer where I realized that I really missed having something that was very scalable that could bring an impact to the people who went through it as well as bring me income without me having to show up 1 on 1, without me having to do any sales calls, without having to do any DMs or slimy marketing tactics or anything. I had had that back in my blogging days and I really missed having that scalable aspect in my business. So I started to consider what kind of product I wanted to have and what was the best way to sell that on autopilot today.

Jamie Bright [00:01:25]:
Because if I've learned anything in the last few years, it's that buyer behavior has changed immensely. In fact, in the last year or 2, a lot of people have seen the results decline pretty significantly because they haven't adjusted the way that they do business to fit this new buyer behavior. But I decided to go with email because that's the one thing that really hasn't changed since I started blogging full time way back in 2011. It literally still works just as well today as it did back then. Whereas things like social media continue to decline in reach unless it's pay to play and even if you are paying to play which is a great way to scale up when you have something that works, it's becoming more and more expensive. And so it's hard to do that profitably. They're only going to continue to increase while organic reach is only going to continue to decline. And even SEO, which I originally built my blog on and was the main source of my traffic is going to be experiencing several upsets over the next few years because of how AI has been changing search in so many ways.

Jamie Bright [00:02:31]:
Maybe you've already seen this on your blog, but email still works essentially the same way. For the most part, it's still reaching far more people than social media. People are still reading their emails and most important, people are still buying via email. It's a phenomenal way to build trust, authority, and desire for your product. And so that's why I picked email to sell this new scalable offer that I was creating and I've been running it for several months now and it works. So in this summit presentation, I'm gonna take you behind the scenes and I'm gonna show you exactly what I did to create this new lead magnet that's different from what most people do and how I based it on this new buyer behavior that I've been seeing in the market. I'm literally gonna walk you through each of the 3 big principles that I used to design this and I'm gonna show you how I translated that into a lead magnet that sells so that you can create one for your own business as well. Because if you are growing your email list consistently, then your sales are going to be growing consistently.

Jamie Bright [00:03:37]:
And if you wanna have a stable business that truly gives you safety and not just stress, then having consistent and predictable income is one of the best ways to do that and I really really want that for you and frankly for me. That's why I created this thing. And then finally at the end, I'm gonna share how you can get a free copy of the one email that I send to every new subscriber that virtually guarantees that I'm going to get in the inbox. This is really powerful. It's super easy to set up and send and you can start getting results from it right away. So you're really gonna wanna listen to the end to make sure that you can get that. Now, if you haven't met me online before, my name is Jamie Bright. I'm the founder of the Bright Entrepreneur Podcast and the ever selling email system.

Jamie Bright [00:04:26]:
I started my online entrepreneurial career way back in 2011 with a blog for photographers, where I taught them how to find clients for their photography businesses. That business quickly grew and over the years I developed an email list of a 119,000 email subscribers, but you don't need a 119,000 email subscribers to make this kind of lead magnet work. In fact, at the time of launching it I only had 720 people on my list at all, so not even a 1000 people because I had spent a few years really focusing on more high ticket, high touch things and leveraging my relationships instead of growing an email list. So last summer, when I decided that I wanted to have a scalable asset in my business again, I started growing my list in earnest. And within two and a half months of launching this new lead magnet, I had more than doubled my email list. I started getting invitations to speak at summits because what I was doing was so different. I started getting consistent sales, which let's just face it, that's amazing. And I had somebody actually approach me about partnering with them in their business and setting up the automation in the back end, and it's just opened up the door for lots of different collaborations, opportunities, and income that I simply didn't have before I created this lead magnet.

Jamie Bright [00:05:49]:
Now I know it sounds like I'm really hyping it up, but that's truly what happened. And it's because I was doing it different from what everyone else is doing, so even if you don't get all the extra stuff in your industry because you're not working with other online business owners like I am, it's still very effective. In fact, if I had never launched that lead magnet, I wouldn't be here in this summit sharing with you about it right now. So not only can this lead magnet bring you consistent income, but it may open up opportunities that you never knew existed that we just can't predict until it happens. Since making my pivot last summer I am on a mission to help online entrepreneurs create consistent and predictable monthly revenue through my mastermind and my courses and my 1 on 1 coaching so that their business can be a source of stability and not stress. So that any launches they do or specific promotions are just extra income on top of what they already have and not necessary income to make ends meet each month. Okay. So here's what I know to be true about buyer behavior that most people take for granted.

Jamie Bright [00:06:54]:
The best time to sell to somebody is when they're actively looking for a solution to one of their problems. And this is why your lead magnet is so powerful for bringing in consistent sales. Because when somebody opts into your lead magnet, they are taking an action that says, in this moment I wanna get the solution and the transformation that this lead magnet promises that I can get. And most people take for granted how powerful it is to know that in this moment, this person is interested. They want a solution. And if we have a product that is aligned with the same topic of our lead magnet, then it makes sense that that person is gonna be interested in purchasing it. Do you see how powerful that moment is? Because here's the thing, it doesn't matter how good your offer is or your product is, if it's not relevant to that person in that moment, they're never gonna buy it. I'm not gonna be out buying diapers for my children anymore because they are all old enough to where they no longer need them.

Jamie Bright [00:07:57]:
And thank goodness because I have 6 kids and we went through a lot of diapers. I don't care how soft, how cheap, how wonderful the diapers are, it's just not relevant to me anymore. I'm not looking to fill that need in my life anymore. If you are selling something to someone who's not interested, it doesn't matter how good your offer is or your sales copy is or any of it if it's not the right time for them and it's not relevant for them. So that's part of why I like to sell through a lead magnet because the moment they opt in they are saying, hi, I'm here, I'm interested, and I want the transformation or the solution that you have in this lead magnet. And so if you can give them a lead magnet that builds trust, that shows them how it can help them specifically and makes it super easy for them to buy right then, they're more likely to do it. Plus, you've already got their attention, and that's, like, half the battle on social media. Right? It's like everybody is screaming for attention.

Jamie Bright [00:09:01]:
Everyone's scrolling through the reels and the shorts and all of these things where you can barely capture someone's attention for even a few seconds. And so if you've captured their attention enough for them to actually opt in for your lead magnet, that's powerful. You not only have their attention but now you know they want what you offer. So why wouldn't you use this as a way to sell to them? And maybe you're sitting there saying, hey, I actually do sell to my new subscribers. I've got, you know, the lead magnet that they can download and then I've got a welcome sequence and it sells in there. I build some trust and I have tell them my authority and I share a few success stories, but it's still not selling. Like, why is it not selling? I'll explain why in just a moment. That's what I see most people doing who really care about their people is they deliver value.

Jamie Bright [00:09:50]:
They go through a 3 to 5 part welcome sequence that warms them up and shares what it is and why it's awesome and all the things and then invites them to buy. But it's really not working that well for most people. They might occasionally get a sale here or there, but not really very often. Then there's other people on the other side of the spectrum where they know that the moment someone opts in, they're interested and so they immediately start selling with them email after email after email, sending a couple emails a day, trying to get you on the phone, trying to get you to buy their thing and it's super pushy, super manipulative and maybe those work but I don't know about you but that just is not my style. I am not here to coerce or force or convince anyone to buy my product or offer if it is not a good fit for them. I want to empower them to self identify that, oh my goodness, this is perfect for me. I definitely want this and then make it super easy for them to buy without any of this pushy, salesy, slimy sales techniques. I wanna build trust with my audience and show them that I actually care about them and their results and making sure that this really is going to be a good fit for them.

Jamie Bright [00:11:07]:
Because let's be honest, we've all probably had people buy our things that weren't a good fit. Maybe it was because we were really persuasive. Maybe it's just because they thought it would be a good fit and then it turned out that it wasn't. Whatever the reason is, when you have people in your programs or who buy your offers who aren't a good fit, they don't get results and they generally tend to be unhappy and then they either complain or ask for a refund or cause any number of headaches. And I've seen it all. I've been in this industry long enough. I've heard the horror stories. I've had a few myself.

Jamie Bright [00:11:38]:
There's no limit to what somebody could do. So I try and avoid bringing people into my programs if I genuinely do not believe it's a good fit for them. And so I try and design all of my sales messaging to not just help build desire for my offer for the right people, but also give people clear indicators of when they shouldn't buy. And I know every sales copywriter out there is probably saying, don't do this, but I think that it's really important to design our lead magnets and our sales copy to make sure that it's authentic and that we're really helping a person. And that's the difference between helping them make an empowered decision and coercing is that we really help them know for real if this is a good fit for them. And if it is, we empower them to buy in the easiest way possible. And if it's not, we say, don't buy, and that's okay. So the goal of the lead magnet is to make it as easy as possible for someone to buy.

Jamie Bright [00:12:34]:
So here are some of the ways that I designed it different from what most people do and from what I see most people teaching. So number 1, I keep everything email only. Most people send their first email, and in that email is like, hey, thanks for signing up for this thing. Here's a link to go download it. They click the link, they get the thing, and they ignore all the other emails. If you look at your stats and your open rates, email 1 will have a really high open rate and click through rate. Emails 2, 3, 4, 5, and such, see a huge drop off in numbers. So when you keep things in email and actually deliver the value in the information right within an email, then it encourages them to continue reading the email and it doesn't require them to download something or log into another site, and it reduces a significant amount of friction.

Jamie Bright [00:13:22]:
Anytime we can reduce friction and make it easier for them to do something or take less actions in order to get what they really want, they're gonna stick around and continue giving us our attention longer because each friction point is a drop off point in attention. So I wanted to make it as easy as possible and keep it all within email. If they're signing up to read email, then I wanna deliver it in email. Now obviously, you can't do this if you are giving away something like Canva templates that require them to go into a different piece of software, but they're already gonna be expecting that so that's not as big of a deal. But that kind of lead magnet isn't the type of lead magnet that quickly builds trust and brings in sales. It might help them quickly get a result, but that's not necessarily gonna build desire to continue working with you and get more value from you. I can't tell you how many free Canva templates and copywriting templates and things that I have downloaded and used and never went back to buy more because it did everything I needed. It's a great way to serve people, but it's not necessarily the best lead magnet if you are looking for income and impact.

Jamie Bright [00:14:25]:
Instead of just doing a single email with a download or something, I did an email based course that has 10 parts, and they are told right at the beginning that it's a 10 part email course. It's totally free, so they're expecting this to be 10 emails long. You don't have to do 10, you can do 3 to 5 if you want to, but because the topic that I was covering was a little bit longer and more in-depth, I did 10. It's what it needed to be. When it's a multiple part email course, it creates engagement, which helps you get in the inbox better, and most importantly it builds a habit of reading emails. So when they get your emails, if they've already opened several of them, they're gonna be more likely to continue opening them in the future because they've already got value or they wouldn't have opened them in the first place. But it's not enough to just make everything come via email, and this is why a lot of people who have well intentioned welcome sequences find that they don't actually convert. And this comes down to the second thing that has changed about buyer behavior.

Jamie Bright [00:15:25]:
They no longer are willing to wait to get the answers they want. There's so many people in the market these days. It's super saturated, and so they're just gonna go find it from someone else. So if you give them the first email in your series but they have to wait for the next ones to come, you've lost their attention. You're literally not doing anything to keep their attention. If they found you online, they opted in, they've read that first email and they're still excited about what they're reading and they want more, it would be foolish for us not to give it to them. So I've actually designed my email course to be bingeable because here's the thing, people who really need what you have to offer and are ready to binge your content will buy. Bingers are buyers.

Jamie Bright [00:16:11]:
It's so weird to me that, like, our attention spans are either 1 to 2 seconds long and we just swipe, swipe, swipe, or we find something that catches our attention, we start to go down the rabbit hole, and the next thing you know, we have binged the entire Bridgerton season. When we capture somebody's attention and they really want what we have, they'll go into binge mode. If something is truly interesting to them and captures their attention in a really deep way, they will binge the entire thing. That's why I've created this lead magnet to be a bingeable email course, which means that at the end of every email there is a link that they can click to get the next email right away instead of waiting for the next one to show up in their inbox automatically after a fixed amount of time. And when people start to use that binge link, they get hooked. And what I have found after several months of running this lead magnet is that bingers are buyers. So if we can encourage them to binge and keep going deeper and deeper without breaking that attention and focus, we're not gonna lose out on the sale in the same way we might if we made them wait for the next part of our welcome sequence to show up and then wait again and then wait again. They can literally binge through my entire email course and buy within less than an hour if they want to.

Jamie Bright [00:17:27]:
It's really powerful to remove the friction of waiting for the people who are ready to keep moving forward. But the power of the lead magnet isn't just in the mechanics of the Binge link, which isn't that hard to set up by the way. You can do it in almost every major email software that's out there. The other key that's really important is what you write in the emails. And I've used several neuro based principles that build curiosity while providing value that make them want to click on that link and get the next email now. When you use these neuro based principles, not only will you hold their attention longer, but you'll also be able to build desire for your offer so that when you do invite them to purchase it, they are ready. They have already got a ton of value from you. They are excited about what you're offering.

Jamie Bright [00:18:18]:
They know it's gonna help them and they're ready to buy. So let me walk you through a few of the neuro based principles that I use in this lead magnet. So number 1, you can't be boring or predictable. Our brains are prediction machines. And so the moment that we read something that we already know, our brains are literally wired to say, oh, I've seen this before. I know where this ends. I don't need to keep reading. And it starts thinking about something else even if they're actually reading and you've lost their active attention.

Jamie Bright [00:18:47]:
And when you lose their active attention, it's really hard to get it back. The second way that this is different from traditional lead magnets is that we're not just giving how to content that tells them what to do or giving them a Canva template that they can take and run with and never have to come back to you for anything again. Now I'm a huge advocate of giving real value to our clients, but if all you're doing is giving them the answers on how to do something, you're not gonna get paid. And we are not charities, we are businesses and so we need to write our bingeable email courses to both provide value and yes some of that is through how to's, but it can't just be that. It needs to be designed to build desire for our core offer and be perceived as so valuable even when you're not talking about your offer that they can't stop binging and are excited to buy when they get to the end of your series. I don't even mention my product name until several emails into the series because it's not relevant at that point. I'm helping them understand what's really happening before I'm ever giving them an option to work with me to get that result, but it's not just fluffy bro marketing, it's actual value that holds their attention and helps them think about what they want in a different way. You also want to include neuro based to binge mechanisms in your emails to make them wanna continue reading.

Jamie Bright [00:20:14]:
Our brains are wired to find the answers to questions and so when we can incite curiosity and make them wonder what's coming next and what is really gonna happen, then they're more likely to continue binging to find out the answer and learn the next piece of value that we have for them. The goal is to provide so much value and to keep them hooked that by the time the offer is actually introduced and they're invited to purchase it, they're excited to you. They already want it. They already trust you. They've learned so much from the first few emails that they're ready to take that next step and move on with you because they want the transformation that you've offered them, and they're ready to go deeper into your world. The goal of the bingeable email course isn't to pressure and coerce and give them just enough to say, oh, here's what we can do but you've got to buy something to do it. It's actually to empower them to make a good buying decision, to see if this is really gonna work for them, to see how it's different from what everyone else is doing, to believe that there's gonna be real tangible value inside based on what you've already given them for free, and then to invite them to buy if they feel like it's a good fit for them. I like to think of it as empowering as opposed to convincing because it feels so much better.

Jamie Bright [00:21:32]:
Now there's actually several more neuro based principles that I put into this lead magnet, but I don't have time to fit them all into this specific presentation here. And frankly the best way for you to really understand it is to experience it. So I actually have a free bingeable email course that goes even deeper into each of the pieces that are made up in this lead magnet that's converting for me, and that will teach you all of the nuances and principles that go into this lead magnet so that you can create a truly effective bingeable email course yourself. It also is gonna tell you the exact technology that you need to set it up, which by the way it's not as hard as you probably think. And inside of this free bingeable email course, I will give you the exact word for word email that I send it every single new subscriber that virtually guarantees I end up in the inbox, and it tells you how to set it up so that you can have that up and ready to go within a matter of minutes. It's really simple. I walk you through it step by step, and it's also included in the free bingeable email course. Plus you'll be able to see exactly how I'm getting 1 to $2,000 sales through this lead magnet as you go through the bingeable email course.

Jamie Bright [00:22:45]:
So the link for that is somewhere below this video. It should be in a button near my bio, so definitely go and check that out. But if you have any further questions about the bingeable email course that I created as a new lead magnet, First, I would go through that bingeable email course. You literally can do it right after this video and go through the entire thing all at once because it's bingeable. You don't have to wait for the different emails to get dripped out to you. Plus, I'll also be in the Facebook group for this summit answering questions. So go through the bingeable email course and then come there and ask because I would be more than happy to answer any questions you have about it. You can also email me personally at jamie@wearebrightertogether.com, and I'll personally respond to any questions you have for me there.

Jamie Bright [00:23:29]:
Finally, if you found this helpful, I'd love it if you would subscribe to the Bright Entrepreneur podcast, which is where I'm sharing the behind the scenes of how I'm growing my second seven figure business in the online world. I hope you found this super helpful. Thank you so much for being here in the summit and for listening to my presentation, and I cannot wait to hear about how you're gonna implement this in your own business. So definitely let me know and we'll see you in the Facebook group.

**Transcript:**
[00:00:09.400] - Liz Stapleton, Summit Host
All right, guys, I'm really excited for this session, we're here with Jennifer Maker, who I've been following, I think almost as long as I've been blogging definitely multiple years now. Jennifer, thank you so much for being here. I really appreciate it.

[00:00:21.760] - Jennifer Maker, jennifermaker.com
I'm super excited to do this with you, Liz. Thank you for inviting me to do this. 

[00:00:26.380] - Liz
Yes. In case anyone doesn't know you, can you just tell them a little bit about your background?

[00:00:32.630] - Jennifer
Yes, so my name is Jennifer and I run a craft blog, a DIY and craft blog called jennifermaker.com, and I started it just over four years ago because I was completely broke and needed something to do to figure out, to get myself out of my my hole of debt, basically. And I now it is it's gone really, really well. And these past four plus years and we get between five to seven million sessions per year.

[00:01:02.960] - Jennifer
And I have over a million subscribers, my mailing list and half a million subscribers on YouTube and all sorts of amazing things. I have a team now of 23 people and it's so amazing and awesome and cool and I love what I do. 

[00:01:21.170] - Liz
Yes.  So and you're great at what you do. I'm not going to lie, I've definitely. Watched some of your Cricut tutorials as I've learned a few Cricut tricks

[00:01:29.940] - Jennifer
You have a Cricut?

[00:01:30.920] - Liz
My sister does and I just buy my own vinyl and then she lets me use it.

[00:01:36.590] - Jennifer
That's cool.

[00:01:37.390] - Liz
Yeah, but obviously like a million email subscribers, like that is insane to think about how many that is. So we're here to talk about basically getting email subscribers, growing your list with the right offer or freebie.

[00:01:52.910] - Liz
How kind of might my first question I guess is how do you decide the format of your freebie?

[00:01:59.870] - Jennifer
So that depends entirely on your audience and your topic. And it took me, I would say, five months until I hit upon a freebie that my audience, my intended audience didn't really have one in the beginning. After all, none of us do in the beginning, the one that they really, really wanted, which in my case was essentially patterns for the crafts that I made. And once I figured that out and I realized how much they liked it, I just kept rinse  and repeating.

[00:02:28.160] - Jennifer
But that's not true of every niche and every topic. Even in my own topic of DIY and crafts, I have other freebies that I use other times. So what I do is I look at whatever it is I'm talking about and I think, ""What do people really need to take the next step to implement whatever it is I'm teaching?"" And it could be lots of things. If it's a project, then of course, having the pattern is super, super helpful.

[00:02:53.720] - Jennifer
But if it's a technique, then there's no pattern for that. It doesn't work the same way. So it could be a worksheet or a really short ebook or it could be like a mini course. So. Or an email challenge, right, there's so many different things that you could do. So I really just asked myself what what would they what would help them make this thing happen for them, whatever it is that they landed upon my blog in the first place for.

[00:03:20.640] - Jennifer
Right. So that's what I do. I just ask the question.

[00:03:24.620] - Liz
Sure.

[00:03:25.310] - Liz
And for yours, where it's really project specific, you probably do create a lot more freebies in terms of, like, for you.

[00:03:36.480] - Jennifer
Right.

[00:03:36.920] - Jennifer
So some people can get away with one killer freebie. That is basically their main topic. And they put that on all of their blog posts or their offers or whatever it is that they're doing. This is not limited to blog blogging at all. But in my case, what I discovered is that they really like patterns which are not difficult to create.

[00:03:57.080] - Jennifer
So I could just make a lot of patterns. So at this point, I have two hundred and seventy five of these patterns that I give away for free in their idea lead magnets for that, like, segment of what I do is that the only lead magnet I have. But it works really well. And if it works well, why wouldn't I just keep doing that?

[00:04:16.220] - Liz
Exactly.

[00:04:16.220] - Jennifer
So I do.

[00:04:17.830] - Liz
I don't want people being, ""Oh my God, I have to go back and create freebie for every single post."" Like, not necessarily, you know, do that at all.

[00:04:25.100] - Jennifer
No, really. You can have one killer freebie that does a great job for you. I just find that I mean and I have some freebies that I'll put on a lot of posts, like I have many courses and challenge that will go on a number of different posts. But for me and my niche, a pattern is like the best one to get people because they can't do the thing without the patterns.

[00:04:46.460] - Jennifer
So it's like a no brainer. They want that. Right. So yeah, I'm sure that I am at the far end of having, if there is a spectrum of how many freebies you have from one to like, I don't know, I'm at that far end with two hundred seventy I'm sure.

[00:05:02.840] - Liz
Yeah, but there was like a few years ago...The thing was they were called content upgrades and every single post you created a content upgrade. But I think it's really if you have like a graphic that makes sense. But otherwise, like one per category is probably...

[00:05:17.330] - Jennifer
Exactly one per category is a great way to do it.

[00:05:19.820] - Jennifer
Like, I kind of separate my content into ladder's. So I call them product ladders. Right. It sounds like really boring and everything, but like so there's my cricket product ladder and there's my sewing one. And I talk about blogging. So I have blogging and we're adding things as we go to. So if I were not in crafting, I would have freebies for those things and the freebies would eventually lead into the paid products. And, you know, you would lead your reader right through the whole thing.

[00:05:50.300] - Jennifer
So, yeah.

[00:05:52.400] - Liz
Yeah, I think I first heard that term when one of Russell Brunson's books or something like that,

[00:05:57.090] - Jennifer
I have no idea where I heard it from.

[00:05:58.730] - Jennifer
It's so funny how terms kind of, they just kind of sink into the community and so on will say it, you pick it up and then like a year later you realize that it was someone wrote a whole book about it.

[00:06:08.888] - Liz
Yeah. 

[00:06:08.960] - Jennifer
But you had no idea. That happens to me a lot. 

[00:06:12.710] - Liz
Yes. OK, so I want to touch on a couple of things you said. You said it took you five months to figure out what really worked so, what were you doing in those five months to figure it out?

[00:06:23.120] - Jennifer
I was, I had no freebies the first three months at all. I had no mailing list for the first three months because when I started my blog, I'm like, I do not want a mailing list that is like super nineties. Everyone hates email, especially me, and I'm not even going to go down that road. But of course, that's not reality. And I think I discovered that like somewhere like in the middle of my third month. And then, of course, I had to have a reason for them to want to join my mailing list, because I used to have, I had a business before this and I just had like a banner up on the page that said, ""Hey, if you want my latest updates and whatever,"" and some people joined, but not very many.

[00:06:59.150] - Jennifer
And I can tell because I was comparing myself with other people in my niche, which was Disney travel, and because they would tell that every once in a while they'd say, I have 150,000 subscribers and I only had 50,000. And I'm like, well, what am I doing wrong? So what, I started my blog and I decided to start a mailing list. I knew that that alone just saying, do you want to join my mailing list would not be enough because of my past failure at it.

[00:07:26.480] - Jennifer
And so I decided, I actually, I got, I stumbled upon this by accident. I had a party planning thing for Minecraft up on my blog. And I had just put it up there and said, here's the PDF. You can download it if you want. And a lot of people were downloading it. So I decided to say, you can join my mailing list and in return I will give you access to my resource library that has this in it.

[00:07:55.850] - Jennifer
And it was like an overnight thing. And then they're like, ""Yes, of course we'll do that. We want your stuff."" So it was it was kind of an accident.

[00:08:05.120] - Liz
Yeah.

[00:08:05.420] - Jennifer
A happy accident, then. I realized that I work for growing a mailing list and then so I tried a couple of things after, after I started the list, which was around month four and they were fails for the most part. They were like, ""Jere's 5 Tips on..."" This thing, or ""Here's how to make a messy Bandini hat.""

[00:08:26.580] - Jennifer
And they didn't care at all. And then I bought a Cricut and, just for fun, it was going to be part of my blog post. And I made a file for it, like, right away because I've been a graphic designer for, like since the late 80s and I thought I should offer it to the people on my blog post, on my blog, because this is related to crafting, right? I didn't really, it wasn't an intentional thing, but I did it and I shared it in a Facebook group that I was in.

[00:08:55.450] - Jennifer
And I put it on to an option and they went crazy for it. And that's how I discovered that this was something that would work for my niche. So I just like threw spaghetti at the wall and something stuck.

[00:09:09.880] - Liz
Yeah.

[00:09:10.210] - Liz
And don't be afraid to do that and fail. You can always take it down.

[00:09:14.170] - Jennifer
 Oh my goodness, I fail so much. People have no idea how often I fail. What my fiancée says is that I fail up, so I just try to feel better and better each time until eventually other people call it a success, even if I'm not really like it's working, right?

[00:09:31.160] - Jennifer
Yeah. Eventually I'm like, OK, that's good enough.

[00:09:33.400] - Jennifer
That's a success to me.

[00:09:34.720] - Liz
Yes. Yes.

[00:09:36.500] - Jennifer
However, in fact, you can't be afraid to fail. You need to embrace failure. You need to make mistakes that you're going to like. You know, you're going to just totally burn and it's going to be horrible and you feel bad. But the next day you're going to get up and you're going to try again and you're going to get a little further that next time. 

[00:09:55.210] - Liz
Yeah. You learn so much more from failures than you do...

[00:09:57.670] - Jennifer
Absolutely.

[00:09:58.310] - Liz
Waiting, waiting, researching. Researching.

[00:10:00.290] - Jennifer
Oh, yeah. Yeah. Don't do that.

[00:10:02.650] - Liz
Yeah. Yeah

[00:10:03.460] - Jennifer
You've got to go there and try it.

[00:10:05.140] - Liz
OK, so you know, because we do, we've all had freebies flop. What do you do with them. Do you kind of stow them away and then sometimes, years later, they make themselves useful again? Do you take down the opt-in on your site?

[00:10:21.490] - Liz
What do you what do you do? You know there's probably a welcome sequence attached. It just it gets very busy real fast

[00:10:28.010] - Jennifer
Well, so, what I do is I keep most of my freebies in like a resource library that's because I have so many of them. So it's so much easier for me just to upload that file into that library and then people can go there to download it. Not all, but almost all are there. So if it doesn't do well, I do nothing.

[00:10:45.900] - Jennifer
I just move on to the next project. I don't spend any more time on it at all. I've only ever had one freebie that I, like, took down and it was a creativity challenge. And the only reason I took it down was because I was lazy and simply recycled everything and turned it into my craft room organization challenge with it, which was a success. So otherwise I would have done nothing with it. I would have just left it there. That was the email challenge.

[00:11:11.940] - Liz
Ok, gotcha.

[00:11:12.480] - Liz
OK, and then how, you know, you say that you obviously you can create your freebies very quickly. Well, some more quickly than others. Another e-mail challenge is going to take you a lot longer to create than a template, I would assume. How long do you think it's too long to spend on a freebie?

[00:11:34.320] - Jennifer
I don't think that question is so easy to answer because it depends on, like, the way you're going to use it. So if this is just a pattern, so that would be my lowest level of freebie, I personally wouldn't spend more than three to four hours on it.

[00:11:53.210] - Liz
OK

[00:11:53.820] - Jennifer
So that's probably the minimum I'll ever spend on something, which maybe seems like a lot to a lot of people, but I don't know. I work a lot and I love to work, so I'm not afraid of work at all.

[00:12:05.670] - Jennifer
And I really like I'm really big into doing a good job. It's very important to deliver a good product. But then I, on the farther end I have, like some, like, small e-books and oh well, actually I have a new opt-In that took a lot longer to make. I created a mini course that that was three videos. Each of the videos is one hour long, but it took me three full days to make them. And we're still editing the videos now.

[00:12:32.190] - Jennifer
I did that just a couple of weeks ago, so I would say that project, which probably took me a week to work to do, but it's a very important opt-in, it's the start of a funnel for our audience after they find us through a project, it teaches them how to use their cricket cutting machine. So it's really important that I do a great job on this because in a way, it's like advertising for how I'm able to teach them through a paid course.

[00:13:03.370] - Jennifer
So I don't want to go cheap on that and I want to do a really good job on that.

[00:13:07.990] - Jennifer
And so that's more involved, but I'll be able to use that for years.

[00:13:12.580] - Liz
Yeah.

[00:13:13.360] - Jennifer
Right. So it's OK.

[00:13:15.160] - Liz
Yes.

[00:13:15.730] - Liz
And with your templates, you probably have like a system in place of how you do it, which speed things along to...

[00:13:23.380] - Jennifer
I do. I do. I have processes in place for nearly everything, unless it's something that I've never done before, in which case, I just wing it. I figure it out as I go.

[00:13:30.610] - Liz
Story of my life.

[00:13:30.690] - Jennifer
Don't we all.

[00:13:30.740] - Liz
Yes, Yes. My VA  asked me a question. I was like, ""I haven't figured that out yet. Don't you know, I'm just winging this."" But yeah. So do you have any advice for developing those, like systems and processes when it comes to creating previews and getting them set up?

[00:13:54.670] - Jennifer
Well, so I wouldn't say I'm good at this because for the longest, like for, so I've been, I've had a blog for a little over four years now.

[00:14:04.090] - Jennifer
Half the time it was just me.  I didn't need to really have a process, something that will be written down. It was all in here. Right? So I just did it. And I'm a very fast worker, so I would just like blaze through it and it be done. And then when I started adding team members and creating and having other people help me, then of course I came upon a problem, which is they're not me to do this.

[00:14:27.880] - Jennifer
So we have been developing the process for other people to do this this whole time that we've been doing it. I think that, but everyone works differently. Some people love to have like a checklist. So, for example, every December, I do what I call upon templates where I have a new project, which means a new design and a new video every day for 25 days, the first 25 days of December, because that's what my audience is most active online.

[00:14:54.550] - Jennifer
So it's a way to get new people to me. And that's a lot of work to go from concept to edit video all in 24 hours.  Which I did do the year before last and the year before that. This year I had help, but so I had this long checklist of things and I would just make a checklist as I went along, adding things so that I could always just follow my checklist. So I think that would be the way to start is if you you start finding yourself making freebies that are similar is to create your checklist and then it helps you know what to take.

[00:15:30.850] - Jennifer
Really, it helps, you know, what not to forget to do, like hooking it up to your ESP, your Email Service Provider, so that it actually delivers to someone or putting it into your library or whatever it is you're going to do with delivery. Right? You don't want to go to all the work and then not actually get it out to people. Right? But yeah, a checklist is a great place to start.

[00:15:51.790] - Liz
OK, and do you, you know  you mentioned email service provider. Is that sort of the ideal way to deliver a freebie or do you do it on the Thank You page after they sign up? Is there an ideal way to deliver?

[00:16:04.240] - Jennifer
I don't think that there is. I think it completely depends on your topic and audience like before. So because I do it all the different ways.  When I, for just my patterns, I put them all into my library and they get the password to it when they join my mailing list as a perk. Right? So that's the main way I do it. But when I was making face masks at the start of the pandemic last year, that was a different audience that was looking for those.

[00:16:31.090] - Jennifer
They didn't want to go to my library and search two files. They wanted their file and they wanted to move on and make it. So I delivered it to them on the Thank You page and then also sent them an email with the link to it so they could download it right from the email. So they don't even have to come back to my blog because the intent there was different than it would be for a pattern. I just needed people to get the information and go on their way and if they kept liking my content, they would stay.

[00:16:58.240] - Jennifer
And if they didn't, they would go, yeah, that was that was what I wanted. There are times when you don't want to hold on to everybody who joins or comes into your orbit, because if they're really not interested in your content or it's a one off thing, you should, you should, you should let them go.

[00:17:13.120] - Liz
Yes. Yeah. Right back at the beginning of the beginning of our talk, you mentioned, you know, getting your intended audience. Right? And so the facemask people may not have been your intended audience. A lot of people were crafting facemasks that aren't crafty in general.

[00:17:34.030] - Jennifer
Because their work sources for them back in April, right?

[00:17:37.150] - Jennifer
Yeah. And so some of those people I would say they would be, if I were to guess, I'd say 15%-20% of those people have stayed with me and are totally interested in what I do. People, they were crafting or sewing or something, and the others have just gone off, which is good because I would have like two million subscribers instead of a million right now. And that's very expensive. But it's one thing a lot of people don't think about.

[00:18:01.650] - Jennifer
But my bill for email is over $4,000 a month. Now I get the money back, like, bajillion fold, not complaining. But you don't want to have a huge list just for the sake of saying, ""Look at me, I have a giant list."" If they're not your people, it's just a waste of your time and money.

[00:18:19.830] - Liz
 Yeah, you're not going to earn that money back.

[00:18:21.960] - Jennifer
Exactly.

[00:18:22.660] - Jennifer
Yeah. So that's, I think, that, and as I as my list grows, it's becoming more and more important that those people who aren't my people are encouraged to leave. So I encourage that often, actually. It sounds kind of heartless, but of course, if they want to stay, they can stay.

[00:18:40.850] - Liz
Yeah, but I think that even if you find a freebie that works, if it's not attracting your intended audience, then it's not really working for you.

[00:18:49.260] - Jennifer
Exactly. For example, you could hear me talking about making patterns and you could go over on to your blog and you can make this awesome pattern that, you know, people love. But if that's not the thing that you do on your blog and that's not the people that you, it's not like your direction. It's just like a thing that you could have done. It's not going to do you any good to have those people who got that pattern because you're not, you can't serve them with what you normally do.

[00:19:13.500] - Jennifer
And they're not going to be interested in the other things that you do. It just doesn't work that way. So focus is really a big deal, I think. Focusing on your audience and what they need and not being all over the map.

[00:19:27.630] - Liz
Yeah, I mean, even if you're sort of throwing spaghetti at the wall when you're evaluating it.  Realize, but, ok, is this attracting the right people?

[00:19:35.500] - Jennifer
Exactly. Right.

[00:19:37.020] - Liz
Because like that...

[00:19:38.400] - Jennifer
That party principle I mentioned for Minecraft, I no longer talk about kids parties. I don't talk about Minecraft, although I love that game. I don't do it. It's that part of what I do. So I no longer have an opt-in for that. I just give it to him. I'm like, here it is. You download it if you want.

[00:19:54.450] - Liz
Yeah. You don't have to make the audience anymore.

[00:19:57.840] - Jennifer
They can have it.

[00:19:58.790] - Liz
Yeah. Yeah, that's easy enough to just to give them a link. You don't have to make them signup for your email.

[00:20:03.960] - Jennifer
That's right.

[00:20:04.380] - Jennifer
You don't have to make them sign up for anything if you don't want. Yeah.

[00:20:07.500] - Liz
Yes. I think a lot of people don't think about that. OK, let me just kind of review my notes to see if there's anything I wanted to touch on. Again, I think you answered all my questions. I think that was it. I know you have something free for all of our attendees, an ebook of some sort?

[00:20:26.640] - Jennifer
Yeah. So I have a book on list building that talks about freebies and how you can use them. It like, lists, like, the different types of freebies, because I know, like, a lot of people when they hear me talk are like, I don't have patterns, I don't do crafts. And it's difficult to understand how this could relate to you. Right? But you, freebies can vary so much. They can be a coupon. They can be a library of resources, they can be an event.

[00:20:54.300] - Jennifer
It can be a Facebook group. There's actually so many different...

[00:20:57.660] - Liz
It can be a video. It can be a checklist.

[00:21:00.420] - Jennifer
Exactly. There's so many. A contest is another one, so long as it's really relevant to your topic, not just some, I'm going to give away an iPhone or something, but that's unless your blog is about iPhone, then that would be fine. But yeah. So the it's an e-book and I think I call this love introduction to list building.

[00:21:18.450] - Jennifer
That's the neighborhood. And it's a really good overview of how I came about to figure out how to do this and then how I implement it and the steps I take to implement it and make it work. And I've been doing the same thing this whole time. It's work. It works like gangbusters. I have to say, I just you just got to find the right freebie for your audience and then you either make that freebie more appealing and you just offer it to more people or you just make more freebies like it.

[00:21:45.510] - Jennifer
That's kind of how I. I see it.

[00:21:48.640] - Liz
Yeah, and I, I kind of want to add or say that stick with it. Right, because so many people get nowhere because they do shiny object syndrome. And so even though they found something that worked, they moved away from it. Actually I totally have been guilty of this, by the way. I'm not judging. You know, they moved away from it and then they're like, well, how come I'm not at fifty thousand subscribers or something?

[00:22:10.990] - Liz
And it's because you got too excited about something else instead of really focusing and growing that one thing that's working.

[00:22:16.750] - Jennifer
I couldn't agree more. I think that one of the reasons that I am successful is because I'm one of the most tenacious people I know. I am very stubborn and I don't give up easily. That's not always a good thing, by the way. But in this case, it actually really helps a lot that I will stick with something and try all the things I can think of until eventually, you know some things don't work. But I will like the blogging, my blogging as a whole.  I just stuck with it until I got to work and I just kept thinking push that square peg into the round hole until it just wasn't square anymore and it fit.

[00:22:52.640] - Liz
Yeah.

[00:22:54.370] - Jennifer
So not giving up is huge. Like seriously it's so huge.

[00:23:00.280] - Liz
Yeah. Ok.

[00:23:02.680] - Liz
And then the last thing on to touch on is you actually very kindly contributed something to our Pro-Pass. So for those that have the Pro-Pass, or thinking about getting the Pro-Pass, you should totally get it, because you're getting from Jennifer a really amazing course, if you would tell them about this.

[00:23:19.780] - Jennifer
Yes, it's my List Love Quick Start Course. So List Love is my method of doing what I do for getting email subscribers and I'm nurturing them and creating a relationship with people. So  let's get you all set up to do it.

[00:23:34.390] - Jennifer
And it's a video course. So it's like a regular full course. And I think it's awesome. I've been doing it for like three years and people have found a lot of success doing this. So it works.  You should try it.

[00:23:50.020] - Liz
Yes. So definitely grab your pro-pass and so you can get inside of that. Jennifer, again, thank you so much for being here. Any final words before we sign off?

[00:24:00.100] - Jennifer
I think that my mailing list is one of the biggest reasons why I am a seven figure, almost eight figure blogger. And if you think about all those zeros, that's way more than I ever thought was possible to do with blogging. The mailing list is the key to it. It was, that was the key to unlocking the revenue. Therefore, I really think it's very important that you make a mailing list no matter what you hear out there.

[00:24:28.180] - Jennifer
Whatever anyone says, take it. Trust me, I know what I'm saying here. Make the mailing list your priority. I make everything final to my mailing list. So my goal is always to get people onto my mailing list, not to grow my social media, not to get a bunch of likes, I don't know, or something. It's always to get them onto my mailing list. So if you make it a priority, it works.

[00:24:52.640] - Jennifer
That's my advice.

[00:24:53.710] - Liz
Yes.

[00:24:54.400] - Liz
So make it a priority. We have lots of sessions to help you earn money from your list once you have it or earn it as they join that sort of thing. Again, thank you so much. And guys, we'll catch up the next session.

[00:25:07.510] - Jennifer
Thank you.

**Transcript:**
[00:00:00.000] - Liz Stapleton
All right, guys. I'm so excited for today's session with Kate Doster. Welcome, Kate. She's incredible. So no, for reals though, I told you I was like, I'm just going to basically fan girl over you for our entire session because I've been blogging for over.

[00:00:19.340] - Liz Stapleton
Five years, a five and a half years. And I've done email marketing courses, and I've done... I know my way around from... I mean, my whole email marketing thing the last year, such a mess. Anyway, but I've taken email marketing courses. I've worked with email marketing strategists, and I bought your course last year, and I didn't start actually doing it until the end of the year. I think I bought it in like bad me. But I was like, I should have done it sooner. It's just literally, and I think when I asked you to do the summit, I was like, pretty, pretty please, will you do it? Because the number of mind blown emojis that you've done for me is just insane.

[00:00:59.340] - Liz Stapleton
I'm so thrilled to meet you.

[00:01:03.310] - Kate Doster
I am so excited. So the course that we're fan girl, both I fan girl with my own stuff sometimes. I'll be honest, you're like, damn, that girl is smart. It's like, Oh, it's yourself. So the course is love your list. We're called Love Your List. We call it Love Your List 2.0 because I did have a beta like everyone suggests, which I think is really, really smart. And we're always trying to improve it. And what I tell people is like, I'm not going anywhere. This is my full-time gig. This is how I support my family. So as I always tell people, especially toward that last email, I'm like, Go with your gut. I'm like, If you're going to wake up tomorrow and wish you just had this in the bag. So when you're ready to write a welcome series or write a sales page that is there for you, then buy it. And that's what a lot of people end up doing. And I try to tell people you can't get behind in the course. It's physically impossible because you're always going to have an idea for something new. You're always going to want to interact with your people and have your game.

[00:01:55.150] - Kate Doster
Love your list is just waiting there for you and all of our huge mammoth glory. I feel like I had.

[00:01:59.360] - Liz Stapleton
The same course, session, but I'm learning from you. It's at the top of my mind, but I just went through... I haven't gotten to the nurturing bit. It was just setting up my freebie. I'm like, well, I'm going to go through this again for my next freebie. Guys, I mean, so I set up... As you know, because I was posting the group, I set up my first freebie using your help. By the way, just the copywriting alone I learned from you. We'll have you teach some stuff because this is the action-oriented somewhere, for sure. But it was just like, I'm not naturally a writer. I have a math degree.

[00:02:39.120] - Kate Doster
I have a half a degree in accounting too.

[00:02:41.570] - Liz Stapleton
Yeah. I was like, even though I've been writing for, obviously five years, I actually was a full-time freelancer for a while, which is hilarious to me. The content is so good. And so my first review went live yesterday, I think, and it's already gotten... Which isn't necessarily time, but I really haven't promoted it on social media or anything. I just like posting a couple of groups like, Guys, what do you think I'd love feedback? And I've already got like, I don't know, 25, 30 people in 24 hours, which without really promoting, really saying a lot, I think.

[00:03:10.780] - Kate Doster
That's awesome. That's so awesome. I'm so excited. I get so excited for my students and then the people that they help, it just gets so exciting. It's like this is why I sell stuff.

[00:03:20.110] - Liz Stapleton
Yeah. And so I'd love for you to... Because I think you take a very different approach for most people, where everyone's like, email marketing is like a dollar for everyone on your list. And there's a lot of... I have read Russell Brunson's books, which do open up a different way of thinking, I think. But I think he does also fall into the category of the brosive or whatever. I'm not totally, he's a smart guy.

[00:03:44.610] - Liz Stapleton
So if you want to share your initial thoughts on the best way to approach email marketing.

[00:03:52.070] - Kate Doster
Sure. So I have nothing against Russell. I have to say, I feel like in his old age now, he's all 40. But I feel like in an old age he has softened a little bit. And if you look at my book, kids, I'm sure I have expert secrets and marketing secrets because I think when it comes down to everything is that you have to see what's out there and to expose yourself and test it and what works best for you.

[00:04:10.550] - Liz Stapleton
You could keep this from different places. That's for sure.

[00:04:13.720] - Kate Doster
Yeah. And then you mold it up into your own brain. And my headspace is so different from most people's that I mean, it's like, really, you're talking about big butts, actual rumps in your marketing? Yeah, obviously, who wouldn't? So we'll talk about the Sir Mixalot principle that it's named after in a little bit. But when you had first said that statistic of a dollar for a person on your email list, I'm like, Eew, you're doing it wrong. I'm just like, What? No, we don't. And that's the first thing that I really want to get to everyone is that I don't believe in logical results. That just doesn't happen. My students get a illogical result. You have to go in there with the mindset. I think what a lot of people when it comes to email marketing, yeah, obviously there are certain parts in their journeys, but they try to teach it like a machine, and they forgot about all of the touchy feeling, what? Right brain creative stuff that really goes into this.

[00:05:04.380] - Kate Doster
Treat people like people. And my particular people in general, that is one of their golden rules. They don't want people to feel like numbers. They want them feeling taken care of, understood and heard. And that's what really great copywriting can do for you. And this is copywriting with a W. And I have to tell people I'm not a blogger who hit it big with a resource library or a freebie, and then all of a sudden she's an email marketing guru. I got paid buku dollars for several years to write these things for other people. The way that I approach it is a lot different. Well, yes, obviously you need people to talk to. You talked about 35. Most people are like, Oh, only 35. I'm like, That's amazing, because I want 35. That landing.

[00:05:48.920] - Liz Stapleton
Page is converting at 38, 40 % right now.

[00:05:52.070] - Kate Doster
Of the right people. And that's key. It's the right people. It makes no sense. And the Russell Branson are like... I feel like the spin off now of Russell at this point. Yeah, because I feel like he's- We'll stop talking about him. The people that spin off of him are extremely bro hemey, extremely. And they're just like, You've got to put in $20,000 so you can get to a thousand dollars, and then burn the list, burn the list, burn the list. I don't want to burn the list. I'm like, I would much rather start with 5,000 of the right people. I need to get myself out there, obviously. It's my job to find them. But when I do like, I don't feel like I sell to people. People just buy for me. And that's because I don't make stuff about me. Obviously, yes, we talked about I was a copywriter. So that way you know this chick's got credit. Yes, I make sales every single day. There's no reason that it just doesn't happen. It does. But that's not what I'm leading with. I'm not like, Oh, you can make sales every day. It's like, look at how amazing we can get you out to your people.

[00:06:47.330] - Kate Doster
And that's always what my people want. And so when you know about your people and what they want and what drives them and what trips them up, all of it just becomes so much easier. I think that you had posted right that you had gone through other email marketing courses, but this was like, the first welcome series that you can actually feel like it's you. And I'm like, that's what I want people to have. I'm going to give you guideposts, but you've got to know your people.

[00:07:08.890] - Liz Stapleton
So I first heard of you when you did Rebel Boss Summit last year because I did that as well. And then I ended up getting your course through Carly Campbell, who's also part of the summit. I'm super excited.

[00:07:20.110] - Kate Doster
Love Carly. Yes.

[00:07:23.190] - Liz Stapleton
And I was like, yeah. And then when I finally dug into it, I remember watching the first module not long after I bought, and I was like, oh, my gosh. But then life got busy and I didn't really dig in. I'm super excited that you linked to one of my resources. I was like, right.

[00:07:38.780] - Kate Doster
Oh, my gosh. It's good stuff, guys.

[00:07:43.770] - Liz Stapleton
Two things that you really blew my mind with was that it just changed the way I thought about it and the way I approached it. Because I did dread having to do email. And I haven't been great about email on my list, but I am now because I just started a whole new one. Anyway, the the make your subscriber feel like a badass. I think that changes your approach to how you write. But I think the other thing that changes how you go out there and promote yourself is, it's my job to get in front of that person. So they don't get the bad advice. Like, I would have gotten to you sooner if you did. That approach, I was like Of course.

[00:08:18.520] - Kate Doster
 because all the Billy Brohems don't shut up. And that was always my biggest critique of myself too. And the other thing that we talked about is being on your list is a privilege. It's not even like I'm thirsty. I'm like begging people to be on my list. No, my freebie is the velvet rope. It is a velvet rope. I do know on everyone because I know that I can't help everyone. And what do I want to make people feel bad about themselves? And they're like, Oh, it's working for adults. Again, no, I'd be the jerk. So I'm only going to set up things for people that I know that I can help. And then they're happy. And then I'm happy. And then everybody is happy. And that's the thing is that we need to be louder. We need to show up in their inboxes. And when you give yourself permission to just be like, Oh, these are people that are just as excited or excited. I don't know all of you eat and breathe email marketing like I do, but you're excited to help your people. And I get to talk to you every single week.

[00:09:10.370] - Kate Doster
It just makes me so excited to email my list because what are they doing? And people were like, back.

[00:09:15.360] - Liz Stapleton
I've gotten replies back to my welcome series already that people just started doing yesterday, two days ago, whatever.

[00:09:23.680] - Kate Doster
I.

[00:09:24.610] - Liz Stapleton
Was like, that's such a great idea. Thanks for everything. This is awesome. I'm like.

[00:09:28.640] - Kate Doster
I don't know, because they can feel your energy. I think that that's what makes my approach so different. Obviously, yes, there's some science behind it and all that, obviously, but it's that feeling behind it. When people can feel your excitement, it also makes them feel like a badass. It's when you're putting yourself in their shoes and someone asks me on a different, How can you put yourself in people's shoes? I'm like, I don't know. I'm like, I just I can't not do it. I don't know if it was because the former musical theater actor in me, the sympathy. I'm like, I don't know. You can just think. What would the other person think? Well, sometimes.

[00:10:03.980] - Liz Stapleton
In a lot of cases, it's not so much putting yourself in other people's shoes. It's putting yourself in your own shoes five years ago or three years ago or whatever. Because the freebie I just did, I couldn't believe I could have been thinking of this sooner, but I was like, when I and then the paid upgrade that I thought of, I was like, When I figured out how to do this. I was like, Oh, my God. I did magic. I told my friends that I did. And I was like, Why am I not... And in my head, I was like, I've got to teach this, but I hadn't figured out how. And it was like, I should have done this already. So I'm pretty excited about it. But yeah. So I think your approach of treat people like people because it makes it not enjoyable for them. You're not selling something, but it makes more enjoyable for you. We didn't all get into blogging to constantly blog where we have no lives who are trying to get conversion rate or whatever. So I think that's an excellent point. Because I think we spark some interest.

[00:10:58.380] - Liz Stapleton
Let's touch on the Sir Mix-A-Lot principle.

[00:11:01.660] - Kate Doster
Oh, I love that Sir Mix-A-Lot principle. We like the.

[00:11:04.620] - Liz Stapleton
Big butts.

[00:11:06.320] - Kate Doster
Okay. One of the core foundations of everything, and this is what I think we do in the freebie module. And when I tell everyone like, Hey, even if you've got one, you should still listen to this because it's secretly the backbone of the whole Love Your List system. And that is working on butts. So if you guys are like, Oh, and he grew up and you know the song Sir Mix-A-Lot Baby got back, literally, he's just singing and then Nicky Minaj- -did it like- -Even.

[00:11:29.930] - Liz Stapleton
If you know Sir Mix a Lot.

[00:11:31.600] - Kate Doster
-whole thing, right? So the Sir Mix a Lot principle is when you are creating a freebie or an easy as offer, even when you're like, which I write in these emails, you have to think of the yeah, buts that people are going to have because that is where you make that big connection. It's like, yeah, I want to start a blog, but I don't have any money. Yeah, I want to start a blog, but I don't know the tech. Yeah, but I don't know what to write about. Yeah, but I don't know how to get people to read it. Yeah, but I don't know Pinterest. Yeah, but... And then this is where you have to get all of this literally out on a piece of paper. I wish I had them. I have literally legal pads full of this stuff about my people, more so than like, Oh, she drives a Honda, but wishes it was a Tesla. Who doesn't?

[00:12:09.320] - Liz Stapleton
Which most of the avatars are like, you know- No. -but it doesn't dig it. I was like, the research, because I've been told how to do market research before and how I did it before versus how I did it with your method was completely transformative. It was the Yeah, but.

[00:12:22.470] - Kate Doster
And so when you start getting like that surface level stuff like, Yeah, I don't get the tag. It's Yeah, but I try things before, but it failed. Yeah, but what if people don't like it? Yeah, but what if people actually read my blog and they do it, but they don't get results? Yeah, but what if I get haters? Yeah, but what if this takes away time from my family? Yeah, but what if I feel like a bad mom? And so when you start at the surface level of the butts, if you will, you get deeper not to sound gross, guys. But then when you get deeper and you start like, we'll go with the the onion example. When you start peeling away these layers, you're just like, Crap. That's it. So one of the people who buy my course, they usually love your list, they do tend to be, not like smaller, but medium bloggers, but they're a little bit concerned about if they get the big guys, the Abbies and all these other people, still like, Girls in Her Blog, you know what I mean? That they're going to lose that personal connection with their audience, that almost they're not going to be themselves anymore.

[00:13:21.060] - Kate Doster
So in one of my emails, it's my job to show you you can still infuse your personality, and you can take care of people in these emails. And then your only job is to make sure people are seeing this and then helping the people at the bottom because we've got the whole middle part taken care of. And so they're like, Oh, my goodness. How did she know that that's something I was concerned about? Because I know my people. If you don't know what to say because you don't know your people well enough in this way. So that's really... And we'll talk about mechanic stuff too.

[00:13:48.710] - Liz Stapleton
Pretend you're Joe in You, but in the non murderous way.

[00:13:52.400] - Kate Doster
Exactly, right? Exactly. Right? Exactly. I think that we don't spend our... Because people are saying, She does this, and she wants to make money every day. Well, what is she going to do with that? Is your person the type that wants to go to Gucci every day? That's her goal? Or is it that she just wants to go to Whole Foods and buy organic beef and raspberry and not care that it's winter. So that's what you need to figure out is what does that vision actually look like for your person? Again, what does losing weight look like for them? Is it that they don't want to have to ask for an airplane extender because they don't want that embarrassment? Or is it that they want to place fifth in a bodybuilding competition and they want to just feel ripped and like they did it? You know what I mean? You need to know on that spectrum, what do your readers actually want? And you get to pick that because you get to pick to you attract because being on your list and reading your blog is a privilege. So you have to be like, Well, I don't know what they want.

[00:14:50.540] - Kate Doster
You literally get to make it up. And then you will attract these people. I don't want to say that it's magic, but it is. That's what happens because they catch your vibe.

[00:14:59.210] - Liz Stapleton
Yeah, absolutely. No, I think that's. Completely on point.

[00:15:03.570] - Liz Stapleton
And then once you start figuring that out and you're looking for... Because one of the things you do is if you're struggling to find out, yeah, but go look. Because people will literally write, I want yeah, but or Sorry about the rant. This or that was a huge... I was like, yeah. And I just kept making notes and it was like a huge thing. Anything that was a rant related to talk that I wanted to be talking about and helping people with, I was like, Oh my God, I could have helped her. I feel so bad that she feels guilty that she's away from her child to work on her blog or the nap time hustle only works if your kid naps or...

[00:15:44.510] - Kate Doster
And you don't have to come out and say, and I don't really know what the proper word is to say this, but you don't have to come out and say how to blog and not feel guilty. It can just be a general overtone or it can be a little bit of a story where you're sharing-.

[00:15:59.400] - Liz Stapleton
I don't like that. To the volunteer in their classroom. You're like, Yeah, I've got time for that.

[00:16:03.720] - Kate Doster
Exactly. You know what I mean? And letting them forgive themselves for being like, Oh, even something that you had said, and I know you're in the course, you don't care anymore. But it's like, Oh, I should have done this sooner. It's like, Let her know. It's okay. You weren't ready to do this sooner or your people weren't ready to hear this yet. And when you give people permission to not be so hard on themselves because they.

[00:16:25.750] - Liz Stapleton
Know that they're working- Everyone is their own worst critic.

[00:16:28.360] - Kate Doster
Right? Then all of a sudden they're like, Oh, my goodness. I can't. I keep on telling people, you'll see this a lot in the business to business space. Again, every market, as I'd like to call them or every group is going to be a little bit different. But for us, it's a lot of forgiving ourselves for not getting there sooner. You know what I mean? And that's the little stuff that we need to be in. And it's the fact that you're still trying. Do you know how many people? We are nuts. Everyone who's watching this stuff right now, this isn't what normal people do.

[00:16:56.550] - Liz Stapleton
-you think no one in your family knows what you're doing.

[00:16:59.150] - Kate Doster
No, this isn't what normies do. Normal people, no offense to others, and I don't feel bad about them. I love the fact that there are people who have jobs because I need people to employ. I'm all for that lifestyle. But the fact that I can make in a month or I actually do make in a month, what I used to make in a year, it's just bonkers for everyone else. But they're not necessarily brave enough or courageous enough at the stage that they're at to take that leap of those zero dollar months. You need to have the fortitude. And for whatever topic that you are talking about, whether it is blogging, whether it is eating, whether it is organization, whether it is more of a lifestyle blog and it's just dressing better, there is always that thing up against it that you can address. So it's like, I picked out outfits and they've looked horrible. Or it's like, I've been concerned about I don't have money to really invest in these pieces. So what do I do? Really to think about the heart of your person, and that's the way I do marketing.

[00:18:00.490] - Kate Doster
And that's why I don't have to sell. I'm like, You're not going to annoy people. I was.

[00:18:05.850] - Liz Stapleton
Just going to say, you don't have to sell. I like that you don't use the term tripwire. It's an easy yes offer, which I was like, I like that better too. It just makes you feel better to be like, I'm just giving you a solution. You don't have to take it, but I thought it might help.

[00:18:23.440] - Kate Doster
Yeah. I'm not going to... So a tripwire, and I know that you guys have probably talked about this in other session, is when you offer something on a thank you page. And so a lot of people, again, a lot of my students, because I know that they have an adversity to selling, they feel bad. Like, Oh, I can't believe it. But it's like if you sat down to create something, don't be a jerk and not tell them for four days. If it is aligned, if it is not teaching the exact same thing that your freebie teaches, tell them about it. Some people are quick starts and they're going to want it. Other people are going to need a couple of days, and that's fine. You don't have to offer it for a discount if it's going to make you feel bad. Offer it be like, Hey, it's $17 here, and don't tell them later that it's going to be $17, but offer it for $17 again. It's just for people who want more help. It's just for people that want actions. That's why it's an easy yes and not a trip wire where I'm blowing them up.

[00:19:14.450] - Kate Doster
And now I'm freaking them out for cash. I'm like, no. No, you said that you want help with X. Once you finish that, which my freebie is going to do, you're going to need Y. Here's something that's literally going to do Y for you. And most people are like, Oh, yeah.

[00:19:27.810] - Liz Stapleton
In the group, because I've posted get feedback in the group, they're like, So are you going to tell me about this again later? Because I didn't get it on the easy yes, because I'm just one of those people that needs time. I was like, not yet that I'm working on it. I'm like, I'm going as fast as I can. I know it's my job to get it in front of you so that you have this, I'm really sorry. I promise. So I'll tell you more about it later. Right? And then just like, Oh, yeah.

[00:19:54.780] - Kate Doster
Because again, even with the content, the blogs, the videos, whatever you're putting forward, like sometimes people just need a little bit more. Like, it's like, Oh, are they all sizzle and no steak? It's just like, yeah. And so that's what you can do for your emails. And I'm sure they'll talk about it a little bit like, Oh, what do you send in your emails? And all that. Obviously, we're going to talk about that part too. She's like, Yeah.

[00:20:16.340] - Liz Stapleton
I mean, emoji over and over again. Because your first module, I mean, you guys, how well she knows her audience is insane. Because I was like.

[00:20:27.030] - Liz Stapleton
She knows me so well. It's a little bit. And so when I was emailing her, I was like, not to be creepy, but I spent winter break with you watching her videos. But she was like, If you haven't been consistent about take care of your current subscribers, here's what you send them each month and I was like, Duh. How did I not think of that?

[00:20:47.590] - Kate Doster
I love that. And I think again, you've got to forgive yourself. And this is a lot different from everyone else, if you can't tell. I don't have a different drummer. I've got a ukulele that keeps my beat. They're right in front of me right now. It's not a drummer. I don't apologize for not emailing people. I'll go in if there's been a time where I tell my students it's something that I know is valuable. We talk about usually resources or apps, and then you say at the bottom it's like, hey, wondering how you got in this email list. I've got to answer this question. It's like, you signed up for this. And then we have this whole thing, and when you break it down to, all right, just say you're going to email your list once a week. I think that in this month right now, I think there would be like five weeks-ish, but it's usually about three to five emails, period. Then we're like, Oh, I only need to create four emails? It's not that bad all of a sudden. Maybe one of them you want to send a blog post. Maybe you're not quite sure what blog post you're going to create this month.

[00:21:43.590] - Kate Doster
That's fine. Ask them a question. Send them a best-up thing. Just talk about what happened on your weekend and be like, Oh, how can I relate it to my person? And then there you go. Then your emails are set. It's not that big of a deal.

[00:21:58.490] - Liz Stapleton
Yeah. It's one of those things that like... Because I feel like there's so many courses on growing your list since grow, grow, grow, whereas you're like, No, I don't want everybody, which is a different approach. But there are very few courses are like, What do you send what's there? And that is not talked about enough in the blogging space and blog post or whatever. And I haven't gotten to this part of your course, so I don't know what you say about continuing nurturing. But if you want to give me a little preview of what I'm going to learn, just a couple of tips. So people are like, you know... Because there is the welcome sequence, which I think most people are... They know what that is. Then it's like once they get through that, they're like, well, what now?

[00:22:38.360] - Kate Doster
Awesome. So I love this question. And again, I love your honesty. So we don't have to make a mountain out of a mole hill. Again, I think that a lot of us, because we're driven so much to help, we do tend to make mountains out of mole hills constantly. So literally what you can do is there's really two different ways that you can nurture your list. If you're the type of person where like me, you're like, I feel like marketing, even though there's some tried and true, things change. Things are different. So I really like interacting with my people in a live time. So I will send my four newsletters. I tell people at the beginning to make it a day in time. I'm going to send every Wednesday. I'm going to send every Thursday. I typically send on Friday. Sometimes I'll send on Tuesday, but usually definitely by Friday, I'll go ahead and I'll send something. So I'll sit down and I'm like, Okay, what do I have coming up this month? What do I know my people are going to be focusing on? So it could be one of these things I know a lot of people at the time they're recording this is still like 2020.

[00:23:34.760] - Kate Doster
You know when this is going live? It's 2020. People really want to go and hit their goals hard. So it's like, okay, what do I have around that? In your industry, it might be like, Oh, a lot of people want to eat healthy. So I want to send four emails, maybe some best recipes that I have, maybe something that I've got coming up, maybe a stumbling block story that I have for myself, and then maybe some cool apps that I like to have because people are going to be interested in that. Well, we just created your whole month of content. Now, either you can choose to sit down and write it all in one shot. Maybe some months you're going to do that because then you know you'll actually do it and schedule it out. Maybe some you're just going to be like, You know what? Tuesday, I'm just going to sit down, and that's just going to be my email day. Maybe. And it's just like, Oh, okay. And then the other approach for people that want a more hands-off approach, I guess, aren't as obsessed as I am, and this isn't bad, is if you know yourself and you know that you're those people where it's like for a month you might be consistent, but then you tend to fall off the wagon and you do have some stuff that's more evergreen, it's almost creating like a second welcome series, if you will.

[00:24:38.570] - Kate Doster
Again, and this is what I tell the students in the welcome series module, it can be as short as five, but if you need it to be 15, then have it be 15 or 10 or 12, and you can always add to it after. Because like, Oh, yeah, it's this. What do you include? Again, if you've been on a podcast or if you've been on a summit, your core modality that you help people with. Usually, most people, as they've been at this for a while, are developed frameworks like, Oh, you need to have A, B and C. Maybe it's a little bit about that. Maybe it's just asking them questions. Then every once in a while, you'll pop in their inbox when you've got something going on real time. It's just knowing yourself and how you operate. For some people, it is doing that in real time, seeing what works. That's like, Okay, well, if this is about mint Julip Day, I can't have that in an autoresponder because someone could get a non-Mint Julip of day. I'll need to do something a little bit different. But then how can you make it a little bit more evergreen?

[00:25:40.600] - Liz Stapleton
Yeah.

[00:25:41.330] - Liz Stapleton
I think that's a great point because I did do that actually for my old site, something similar. Obviously, very different. Now I'm figuring things out. But I like that you're covering that and you do focus on.

[00:25:54.490] - Kate Doster
That because I know...

[00:25:55.410] - Liz Stapleton
So another question. Because I don't know a single blogger that only takes one course. You know? -it's like email.

[00:26:04.080] - Kate Doster
-no, you shouldn't.

[00:26:04.940] - Liz Stapleton
Yeah, email is so important. They're like, Your blog is your marketing point. But your email is where you really connect with people. So if you have to skip either getting a blog post out that week or email, skip the blog post. Email is where you get to really... It's basically building up your own group of friends, guys.

[00:26:21.020] - Kate Doster
And people, again, know the butts and the modality, especially when it comes to emails. We don't want to annoy people. We've all gotten bad emails or really rohime emails, but people like getting good emails. And don't psych yourself out. Oh, I don't send... What if I send bad emails? You won't when you are thinking about your person and how you can make their lives better and sharing a little bit of you and your quirkiness. And again, making it about them feeling successful or feeling like they're not alone or just giving them the cool insider tip like, Oh, I have this app. I can make this done. Then they're always going to enjoy your emails. And everyone's like, Oh, well, do you have a specific length? It's like, it doesn't matter if it's one sentence or a million. I mean, know if it's a million, you've got to make sure it's broken up and it's going to be good because not everyone goes to their inbox to read like they would a book. I think that's sometimes what people tend to forget. Again, treat people like people, when they're going to their inboxes, it's usually like a quick hit of inspiration or a quick let's do this type of a thing.

[00:27:26.480] - Kate Doster
They don't necessarily want an ultimate guide in their actual inbox, but they will read it if you put it in a PDF, treat people like people, and they'll be more excited. I'll do that every once in a while, especially for my people who get bloggers who love writing ultimate guides, or even if you have a really great post, even though I know that you probably want traffic, whether you're doing Mediavine or something else, consider turning it into a quick PDF in Canva. You can add that to your welcome series, or you can just send that to your subscribers, and people love it. And all you're doing is literally upcycling stuff that you already have, and it's building up such goodwill. It's like, that's one of my favorite things to do every now and then. I'm just like, oh, here's the Black Friday guide. It was based off a podcast, and you can read the blog post. Here it is. Here's a couple of worksheets to help you out. Would you really just like blank pages? People love them. I like making them. It's like, okay.

[00:28:17.980] - Liz Stapleton
Yeah, because especially it's so funny because when you first start blogging, you're like, Oh, my God. You're so nervous to publish anything. And it's like, no one's reading yet. Right.

[00:28:30.160] - Kate Doster
Those.

[00:28:31.000] - Liz Stapleton
Are things because you probably put a lot of effort into it. You can totally go back to those, redo them, republish them, turn them into a PDF. That's a great point. But I always like when I'm like, I don't know where to start. I'm like, Hey, well, how would I tell my friends about this? And take that approach. Like you said, you want them to be good friends to you. That's why you're attracting those people and it makes a difference.

[00:28:53.240] - Liz Stapleton
And clean your list.

[00:28:54.220] - Liz Stapleton
And stuff. But I know we are... I don't know how much of your chat we've already taken up. It's okay.

[00:28:59.490] - Kate Doster
I'll chat about this stuff forever.

[00:29:01.650] - Liz Stapleton
Because you love it. But you are giving a great freebie open rate catapult. Can you tell what that is so we can... People know to go get it. I mean, they should know to get it from you guys. When you're like, they're going to... I've said this with another speaker too. I'm on her email list. I'm obviously on her email list. And then whenever I see her name, I like star them. That was like, if I don't have.

[00:29:22.380] - Kate Doster
Time to read them, I'm coming back. Yeah. Right. And that's why I tell people like, oh, subject lines don't matter that much. And they're like, What? Because everyone wants great subject lines. I'm like, Yeah, open rates are fine. You should also know, and we talked about this in the masterclass that you guys are getting access to as well. Sometimes on mobile, it has a hard time registering open. So some people might actually be opening your stuff. Spoiler, your open rate could be higher. But really, the thing that causes people to open and email the most, just like you said, is the name. There are certain people who I just enjoy their stuff. Usually it's a little bit more personable. It always has to deal with what I'm interested in learning about from them. It's not super in left field. Or if it is, they can turn it around to be like, and this is how it appears to you. And here's why buying a new plant is going to help you with this. Even if you talk about cooking, you know what I mean? If you just turn it around.

[00:30:15.350] - Liz Stapleton
I want sent an email that was about shaving my legs and relate it to affiliate marketing.

[00:30:19.820] - Kate Doster
Yeah, right. I literally have. Actually, we were literally just talking about Love Your List because it's not always perfect. I forgot to include a template in there. I think we're going to add more too because I'm just like, I like creating and stuff. I literally turned how I locked my keys in my car into an email that generated thousands of dollars. Okay? So you can literally take something that was crappy. How can you relate it to the overall bigger principle of things? And then if you've got something to sell, you can ask at the end. We call it the 10K Blueprint. I don't want to say it's that hard. Once you start practicing it, you're like, Oh, because everyone's like, How can I add more of myself in the emails? I hate it when people talk about their lives. You hate about it when they drone on and on and on. But when they relate it to something that you care about, they're going to read. And that's how people feel like they're my best friends because they'll know my word of the year or that I like to go into the sprinkler park and actually be in it as opposed to being the parent on their phone, like miserable.

[00:31:14.330] - Kate Doster
Why would I want to be hot? That's dumb. And allowing yourself to use your own vernacular and all of that great stuff. Again, you're going to notice a lot of what I teach, it's a lot of what I teach. It's to be you, but to always make it about your person at the same time. So the open rate catapult, we talk about ways to really jish up your subject line, how to actually make it some people see your name and they get excited. It's very concrete, like do this and do that and all of this stuff. So you guys head on over to katedoster.com/openrate. You will get it there. I think we have a handout to go with it as well. It's told right for that course.

[00:31:47.930] - Liz Stapleton
They'll totally be able to grab it there for sure. But definitely, guys, everything she sends out is just gold. It's going to, Mike, drop, blow your mind. It continues to. I've been just powering through her course. I had to take a break after module two because it was the copywriting.

[00:32:08.050] - Liz Stapleton
It's a lot to absorb.

[00:32:09.220] - Kate Doster
It's a big one.

[00:32:10.740] - Liz Stapleton
It is.

[00:32:11.500] - Liz Stapleton
I wrote the notes very quickly while watching news because you do talk quickly, which I appreciate because I've fully done that. Of course, this is where I speed them up.

[00:32:20.260] - Kate Doster
I teach people how to slow mine down and speed them up. You're very excited.

[00:32:27.530] - Liz Stapleton
I rewrote the notes neatly afterwards, just so I could go over it all again to help it release again, which I feel like they're definitely going to watch this video. Need to watch this video more than once to get everything you said to sink in. Definitely. Definitely check her out, guys. Go to the freebie, open your... Because it is. I've taken it. It's fantastic. So thank you so much.

[00:32:50.170] - Kate Doster
Thank you guys so much. So remember guys, just being on your list is a privilege. People do want to hear from you. And if they unsubscribe, I don't think it was like, oh, like our objection on myself. I mean, you know on Instagram, at least for a while, the modality was follow, unfollow. Nobody really cares that much. I think that with emails, people get afraid because they're like, Oh, what if I get a slap on the face? They'll unsubscribe. You can think of it as just like, again, true people like people. Maybe they've already solved their problem and good for them. I'm excited that they've got it done. That's amazing. I hope I played a small part. Maybe they're just Marie condoing their inbox and everybody went like, It's okay. It is okay. You're right people are going to be there and you're always going to find more people to help. You just have to know not only what to say to them, but how to say it and give yourself permission to do it. That's really what Love Your List is just about. But thank you guys so much for having me. Oh, listen to my podcast.

[00:33:43.840] - Kate Doster
I always forget it. Inbox Besties is my podcast. It's everywhere. Itunes, Stitcher, Google Play, where we talk week after week, email marketing, copywriting, business, mindset stuff, all of that goodness. I interview people who to help fill in the gaps because I don't everything. So Inbox Besties guys, is probably one of the second best places to hang out with me besides my inbox. Yes.

[00:34:07.340] - Liz Stapleton
Definitely check it out. I'd listen to it. She's got some great episodes on there. Thank you again. And just everyone, go check it out. We'll catch you at the next session.

[00:34:17.280] - Kate Doster
Bye.

**Transcript:**
[00:00:13.190] - Interviewer
Hi, guys. I'm so excited to have this speaker back. She was part of the very first Blogger Breakthrough summit back in 2020. I fangirled her real hard during her session. I'm going to try to keep it in check today. She is the host of the Inbox Besties Podcast and also the creator of the Love Your List Course, which in my opinion, basically teaches you all the things - email marketing. She's just super awesome in general. A big, warm welcome to Kate Doster. Thank you, Kate, so much for being here.

[00:00:38.930] - Kate
Well, thank you so much for having me. I am super stoked to be part of the summit again. It is one of my favorites. I really love how well it is structured with your tracks that you have. I think that helps so much when coming to such a big summit.

[00:00:51.770] - Interviewer
Yes, don't try to watch all of them, guys. It'll be too much. Okay.

[00:00:58.070] - Kate
That's why the Pro Pass is so great, because then you're just watching your leisure.

[00:01:01.490] - Interviewer
Yes, yes,  All Access Pass or Pro Pass, either one. So I kind of want to dive in because we have a session on list building, and I think a lot of people can find tons of tutorials on setting up your email list and your forums and un-nurture sequence, right?

[00:01:17.270] - Interviewer
Like, everyone got that basic stuff. Once you have your nurture sequence, what's next? What do you do, like? Okay, you've got these people, they're nurtured and you email them. But really, how do you make it into a plan that's going to help your business?

[00:01:32.270] - Kate
I absolutely love that question. I think that you are correct. Well, having people to talk to is important, so definitely make sure you watch that session. I think having an action plan for what to do with them after that nurture sequence or after that welcome sequence. It's really where the true fun stuff begins. I think most people would say, oh, that's where the work begins. No, this is where the fun stuff is, so you can take two approaches. You can be sending emails live every single week. That's a traditional newsletter/broadcast, and I always recommend that people to do that once a week. It's okay if you miss a week.

[00:02:02.870] - Kate
It happens to the best of us. Just get back on the horse. It's four emails that you're going to be sending out. When you send them out in real-time, that means if you sign your email out and say the 13th, if somebody had signed up on the 15th, they're never going to be able to read it. If you wanted to, and this is definitely more advanced. And I would only suggest it to people who have all of their digital products down, know their niche, have their messaging if they want to switch to more of an autoresponder type of a thing.

[00:02:30.590] - Kate
So essentially, you're taking that nurture sequence and you're putting it on steroids where you are sending everybody through the first set of welcome emails, and then you're sending them through either sales nurture sequence or do this sequence or based on this click search sequence. But most people, especially when they're in the intermediate area, this is where we're really starting to thrive into what we want to be known for, the products that we want to have, the people that we want to help. So really, it is getting our sea legs. So you don't need to think too far out.

[00:02:57.950] - Kate
No, you don't just start with real time first when it comes to helping out your people. 

[00:03:04.550] - Interviewer
Okay, and then kind of what... At what point would you expand that nurture sequence? So I think a lot of people start out with simple three to five, which is chill and great and works. Is there a point that you would want that to be longer before you start doing live stuff or sales sequences?

[00:03:25.250] - Kate
I would say that it just depends on you. I think that a lot of people are like, what? That's your answer to that. If you are the type of person that is going to be consistent and email every week, then you can stand to have a shorter nurture sequence. What I do want you to have set up at least twice a year. It can be once a quarter if your business is going through big pivots and you're making big changes is to go back and look at that nurture sequence, because you might have some digital products.

[00:03:51.470] - Kate
Now from going through this summit, you might have a signature program at this point, but you're not talking about it in your old nurture sequence. Or maybe you're really into productivity when you started, but you've actually sort of pushed away. And now you're just somebody who wants to talk about, say, [inaudible 00:04:05]  if you're in the [inaudible 00:04:07]  space. So you need to make sure, like, is this up to my writing quality now six months later, right? Because if you're not embarrassed by your past work, you're not growing and you're not maturing.

[00:04:16.850] - Kate
So be embarrassed by everything. That's the best thing, but you got the right stuff to be embarrassed about. And then again, is this nurture sequence actually supporting my goals? So you might have a nurture sequence. You might be a little bit more advanced and have an actual sales funnel, which we can talk about the difference between those two if you want to and you might want to in your nurture sequence, say that you've got some type of kick-off event for your sales funnel.

[00:04:43.670] - Kate
So sales funnel is traditionally at the end of it and throughout it, you're usually selling something that's higher-priced, that's kind of the funnel part. Sometimes people have a webinar, some people will have a free challenge that they're running, but it's something that you can kind of have on evergreen, so you might have a free, that's just sort of a one-off PDF or a cheat sheet or say, audio that you've got that you're giving out to people. So in a nurture sequence, you probably want to tell them, I call it like a launch trigger or sales trigger about that sales trigger that you now have.

[00:05:13.490] - Kate
Now they can go through the funnel. So that way you're kind of helping people from every angle. So you said a sales funnel is very, very focused on selling one product. It usually is higher priced. You don't need to have an eleven-part sales series for a $27 offer. That is cutting butter with the chainsaw. It is overkill. Like, yes, you can do that. But people do not need eleven emails in a row about that. Usually, they would need those 9, 10. I guess it depends. It could be a lot less than that about that one product and about not only that one product, but it's about how you can help them.

[00:05:51.230] - Kate
It's about helping them figure out, like, hey, it's okay if you've tried this before and it didn't work. Here's why it didn't work. And here's why this thing is going to work for you now. Here's why it's different. Here's why I believe in you. Here's how I can help you. Here are some other people have done it, those sorts of things. 

[00:06:09.050] - Interviewer
Yeah, because I think, isn't it like people need to see or hear about procurement at least seven times or something before they'll buy like that's some statistic.

[00:06:17.990] - Interviewer
I swear, I'm not making it up.

[00:06:19.560] - Kate
You are not.

[00:06:23.030] 
What? 

[00:06:24.110] - Kate
I said you're not.

[00:06:25.070] - Interviewer
Yeah, I didn't think so. Sales funnel is much more focused in terms of selling products, whereas nurture sequence is really more like giving them help and showing them how awesome you are and making sure they're your people because I know your people.

[00:06:43.010] - Kate
 Exactly. It's a little bit more of, like, I like to think of a sales funnel. And this is my metaphor, because when my brain works like a sales funnel is to say, like, you're having a party. You want everyone to play Dance Dance Revolution, like, back in the day. So you need to think of, like, every reason why, Samantha, you say your ideal person, whatever you want to name them, right? Why wouldn't you want to get on the dance floor is because she thinks she has no rhythm.

[00:07:06.350] - Kate
So how can you prove to her that rhythm doesn't matter? Is it because she's embarrassed? Is it because she'd want a partner? Is it because she doesn't know what song it is? Is it because there's a room of strangers? So you're basically trying to do everything you can to be like, is this really a good fit for her? And what can you do to make her feel more confident about either of her decisions? Because, again, it's always up to them. And that's the thing about sales.

[00:07:27.950] - Kate
I'm not coercing you. It's just like, look, this is it if you're this type of person, right? Whereas the welcome series is coming. Oh, yeah. Here's Dance Dance Revolution. Here's the chip. Here's the bathroom. So you can sprinkle in some lower price offers. You can have two emails about an e-book that you have. Go ahead. You can talk about how you got interviewed on an amazing summit. You can go ahead and talk about your podcast, your Instagram, those sorts of things. So that way, again, it's all about keeping them into your world.

[00:07:58.010] - Interviewer
Yes. No, I do like that. They don't need to be the people that take towels to the Dance Dance Revolution machine at the arcade. I used to work at an arcade, so I have very different numbers Dance Dance revolutions when I was in high school and network.

[00:08:16.410] - Kate
Hold onto the bar and the beater going, oh, my God.

[00:08:19.350] - Interviewer
Okay, so when you have a funnel, that's kind of an evergreen thing that's going. And you're probably... Unless again, you're way out there in term of advanced doing weekly emails or broadcast. How do you sort of plan out your promotions to align with those? Whether it's like an affiliate promotion or say, okay, that month, I'm going to promote this product. Do you kind of plan it out month by month or how do you sort of plan your promotions, I guess? 

[00:08:49.170] - Kate
That is a great thing and realize that you can always leave room for inspiration. But I think having a plan because human brains, like, they need to have a closed-loop, or they just, like, expand regardless, if you've got ADHD like, I do or not, it's just the way that a human brain works. So what I like to do when I'm sort of planning my broadcast or my month, I'm usually one of those people that's, like, three months at a time. And this is only recently because my VA is like, you need to start planning around in advance. It's like, oh, next week is next month.

[00:09:22.870] - Kate
What am I going to do next month, right?

[00:09:24.670] - Kate
So, realize if you're not a big planner, you can start with just knowing next month. So you're going to look at next month. And what I like to look at is, do I personally want to be doing anything that month to say that, again, maybe you do have a signature program? Maybe you've been looking to sell some principles. Maybe, you know, that it's going to be Black Friday, or you're going to be capitalizing on January spirit or, you know, in February when you fell off the wagon.

[00:09:49.330] - Kate
So you want to be doing a promotion that you've got around there. So you're looking at what am I going to do this month? And sometimes you can look at what am I going to do next month as well, in case if you need to be setting anything up. So the thing that I like to look at is, okay, if you already have a product, is there anything that's kind of just tickling my fancy to feature because you don't have to have a big sale, you don't have to have a discount.

[00:10:11.050] - Kate
It can literally be something where, say, if I decide that I want to highlight the email marketing ferry for two weeks, right? Like, yeah, I could give away one of the free templates right from it. That's pretty direct. And if you want the rest of them, go ahead and buy them here, right?

[00:10:24.970] - Kate
We've got to make sure that the free template they weren't aware where it came from. There's a link to go buy the whole thing, but it could just be one of those things where I can give tips on how to figure out ideas for your weekly newsletters when you don't have any and you're not feeling creative, and then I can have a PS as a bunch. If you really don't feel like writing them. I got 30 of them here in this product. So it's just like a really casual mention of something. I have a student that is in the budgeting space.

[00:10:53.170] - Kate
And so what we did for her at the beginning because she was really sales averse, and that's what I found that a lot of people are just so nervous for asking for money. This is for you, like, pipe up your ears. So what she would do is she would do her normal newsletter content. And anyone where she wasn't linking to what we consider something really important. So that's not real. Not every blog post is super important, guys, like, you know, your pillar post versus the ones that you just kind of put out there, like, we all have them, right? So anytime that she wasn't linking to, like, a pillar post or say, I couldn't get her do webinar. But any time it was super pivotal, she wouldn't do this. But in all the other ones where she was just casually teaching, she wasn't linking out to anything. They were just looking at your Instagram. Maybe it was nothing. We literally just put at the bottom of her emails. You can say PS, or you can say nothing. She just had other ways that can help you. And then she had three of her products, she had taglines for them. And really what this tagline was? It wasn't anything clever, guys. It was the problem - if you're having this, check this out type of a deal. And so we made sure for her three products that are on the budgeting space that if this is a problem, it was really specific. So it's not just like, oh, you can't grow your audience. It would be like if you have an opt-in in form on every single one of your blog posts and your email list, it's still five. Click here.

[00:12:12.910] - Kate
And then every single time she sent an email, she would make money. Again, her products weren't huge because they were in the budgeting space. Like, she just got addicted. And then she got more comfortable actually creating sales emails, which... Spoiler - every email is a sales email, you know, it was the truth, right? Like, every email you're selling this fact that you get your people, that you're going to be there for them, that you're knowledgeable, that you're in their corner, that they're not alone. So you're constantly selling.

[00:12:41.530] - Kate
You're constantly selling in there. It's a matter of you're asking for money, but she got more comfortable. But again, for starting that footer, just advertising her own stuff because I guarantee a few emails... I can do this with mine. If you emailed your whole list right now and you ask them, what do I sell? People aren't going to know.

[00:12:58.750] - Interviewer
That's one experiment that I need to do.

[00:13:02.770] - Kate
I don't think most people honestly have the nerve to do that. But if you're like, do you know what I say? Do you know what I have for sale? Just wondering. Again, since we're in the B to B space, business to business, it's a lot easier just to be honest. Yes, with business to consumers, it could be a little odd, but a lot of people won't even know. They're like, oh, my goodness. I didn't know you had that. We assume that people are, like, stock or level a million with us. And don't get me wrong.

[00:13:29.750] - Kate
You will have super fans. You will, but 98% of people...

[00:13:34.610] - Interviewer
And it will weird you out and you're like, did you make a mistake? You bought everything I have.

[00:13:40.670] - Kate
Isn't that right? My favorite is when they buy something twice, but you used it. Is this so bad that you forgot you had it? Oh, no. It's just like, really, it was really good. It's a great sales message. I'm going to sell you, I thought it was different than the other one. It will happen. But again, you need to, and this is why I wanted intermediate, because again, you kind of got your footing, you know where you're going, and now you're getting into sales. And that's why I really thrive, because treat people like people, right? When you throw down cash for something like the All Access Pass, like the pro pass.

[00:14:14.510] - Kate
I'm not saying that you guys aren't going to do stuff from watching the free because you probably might. But human beings value the things that they pay for. It's just the truth. Think about it. If I am going to shell out $50 for something, I'm going to make sure I'm going to get my $50 worth, right? Again, this is why I do this all the time, It's the truth.

[00:14:32.990] - Kate
I've got my wedding purse, which is my next Gucci bag, and I've got my target everyday thing that honestly had a melted protein bar in it today. Shouldn't leave my purse in the trunk and protein bar. I made that mistake. So people value things that they pay for. They'll take it a little bit more seriously. So just give them the chance to take themselves more seriously. If you're like, I could never sell my principals for $50, then don't put $50 on that price tag. That's not what I'm asking you to do.

[00:15:00.290] - Kate
I'm just asking you to give them a chance to take themselves more seriously. So shove a price tag on there. It could be $2. I do not care. Tell them about something you've got for sale.

[00:15:10.730] - Interviewer
And I have two thoughts that came to mind as you were talking. One) It kind of goes back, but if you miss a week, don't say anything about it. They're going to just think that they missed your email. People's inboxes are ridiculous. So you don't need to bring attention to the fact that you missed a week. And then the second thing I wanted to say is there are so many templates out there for, like, how to write a sales email or whatever. And they're great. But if they don't sound like you, it's not going to work. If you're writing it and you're like, okay, I've worked really hard and I filled it out, but it's a sales email, and you're not 100% behind it. You're not going to sell, make it yours. So if you and your audience aren't people that need 17 emails in a week during a launch, don't be that person.

[00:16:00.590] - Interviewer
My audience. I'm like, guys, I'm tired. Like I have other things to do, here's what you need to know a lot of times. That's what it is. I'm not emailing 17 times. I've tried those things. I've tried really tons of emails where they're like, last chance and stuff. And I haven't seen a difference. And it's because my audience knows me, and it's really just not my style to be like, buy now! Buy now! If you want it, get it.

[00:16:30.030] - Kate
I think that's really important because people will read energies. That is probably what makes what I teach different about email marketing than everybody else, because nobody talks energetic. Like, if you're coming at something with desperate energy or, like, I need cash, it's never going to work. People can see right through it. And you might be like, they're never going to know. They're going to know. They are going to know, they're going to be like, oh, my goodness. Again, in the B to B space, their quarterly taxes are due.

[00:16:57.570] - Kate
That's obviously why they're running this sale or, oh, like, I heard their launch flops, and now they're just trying to recoup some costs. People can feel that when it's like, no, we just had our big launch of this course, and I realized it's an investment for a lot of people, which is why I wanted to give you the sort of smaller version. It's going to help you with this and this. So that way, next time around, when we launch, you're going to be ready to go and you're going to be a step ahead.

[00:17:22.590] - Kate
Which one sounds better? Like, oh, yeah, I'm having a fresh flash sale on this bottom thing. Or because I know that this is an issue that you have. Here's why I'm doing this. And when you put your people first, that matters, and they're going to be able to hear the sincerity in your words. 

[00:17:39.750] - Interviewer
Yeah. It's also the fact that they are your people, right. That goes back to one of the biggest aha moments I had learning from you is that it's a privilege to be on your list. And the people that aren't your people.

[00:17:51.210] - Kate
Yeah, they're not allowed. Again, we very rarely get anybody replying back with nasty messages like ever. And if I do, I'm like, what did they sign up for? How do they not know that this is how I am and they're not allowed to be in here? So I'm like, I'm mad at my landing pages and like, I'm mad at my freebies. I'm like, you are not allowed to be here. You cannot hang out with us. I know I'm not everyone's cup of tea. I would rather you find anyone like, I am so passionate.

[00:18:18.570] - Kate
I know that you are as well. I am so passionate about putting money in the hands of good people. I don't care who you learn email marketing from, you just need to because it's effective. And when you learn how to write a great email, guess what guys? It's going to turn into a great Instagram caption. It's going to turn into great sales page copy. It's going to turn into great Facebook post. It gets engagement, because when you learn how to write words that move people, amazing things are going to happen. You just have to be brave enough to actually do it. 

[00:18:49.650] - Interviewer
Yes, yes. And again, like you said, if you are embarrassed by what you did before, then you're not writing enough. You could fringe so hard at, like, your first blog post or your first email.

[00:19:02.670] - Kate
Right, but you need to be proud of yourself that you actually did. You cannot learn how to swim from reading a book. You've got to go in the Lake, you've got to go in the pool and you've got to be bad at it. But if you're not allowing yourself to be bad at it, then this is going to get this question. And it's probably one for this list building that might have come up as well. How many people should you have on your email list before you start emailing regularly?

[00:19:25.110] - Kate
The answer is one, it's you. Would you rather practice your cool Ukulele in front of 10,000 people or 4? You'd rather practice it in front of 4. So that way, by the time you get to 10,000, you're a well-oiled machine. And even if you have an off day, who cares? You realize it's just one of the many emails that's going to go out and it's cool. 

[00:19:47.490] - Interviewer
Yes, I think one of my favorite quotes I've ever heard is amateurs practice until they get it right. Professionals practice until they can't get it wrong.

[00:19:54.690] - Kate
I absolutely love that quote. And to go back to one of your original questions about, well, how do we actually sort of plan out our month. Again, what are you doing?

[00:20:03.630] - Kate
What is going on seasonally is a really big one and what do you know, kind of happens around it? So say, you are an affiliate for a program and you know that in March, that's when they tend to do their big launches. Some people will tell you out of time, I'm really proud of my affiliates. I tell them like, two weeks ahead of time. But if you kind of know that it's coming, then you can plan around it and it's like, oh, yeah, you know what? I know that the course about Crocheting, she tends to really go hard for it around March for some strange reason. I don't know. Maybe she calls it. I was going to say October, but obviously that would be October at the time. So I need to make sure that maybe my last email is a month. I'm like, hey, guys, and if you're interested in learning a new skill besides just painting, I actually found this free event that's going to be starting, and then you can give them a link to the free event. You can talk about it a little bit more and just go with it.

[00:20:59.970] - Kate
When it comes to affiliate marketing and emails, in particular, the things that are going to work the best is your experience with it. So I know that some people that have Ginormous list from really big lifestyle blogs, which again goes the exact opposite of being on your list is a privileged mindset. But you might have followed that advice. That might be fine. They'll do things like sponsored emails. There is not enough money in the world to make you send a sponsored email, but I understand the allure of it for some people.

[00:21:29.370] - Kate
So you need to make sure if you are taking, I don't know, Windex's money. I don't have to do that. You're actually using Windex. Yeah, I would not use the Swipe copy that they're going to give you, that's the pre done email. Talk about your experience, talk about why it was bad, like that's the thing that if you really want to make affiliate money, talk about a downfall of something because people will be so blown away that you are honest that they'll be like, yeah, it's like, look, I'll be honest with you.

[00:21:55.650] - Kate
It is absolute crap for cleaning the microwave, but my windows in the kitchen have never looked better. So people are going to appreciate your honesty when you talk about a downfall or when you talk about results like, this is why it's so important that you've interacted with this. It's like, look, I've fallen off the fitness bag in a couple of times, but honestly, when I got back on like, this thing helped me lose 10 pounds and I didn't feel like hot trash all the time, which is really shocking, because most of the time I do and then that's when people are going to be like, yes, I will buy through your affiliate link. You're the best. 

[00:22:29.310] - Interviewer
Yes, and it doesn't even have to be about something you're promoting. Some of the most successful emails I've had this year, I've been bombarded. I was bombarded by tons of different bloggers about a tool that had just gone hard on marketing. And it was a good tool.

[00:22:44.730] - Interviewer
I was like, look, guys, I have nothing against this tool. I tried it, it's awesome, but it's pricey. If you want a cheaper alternative that works just as well, here you go. And they're like, oh my gosh. I got so many emails about that tool. I got so many responses. Thanks for not like, just adding to the noise of pushing that tool and giving me an alternative. I wasn't like saying, I'm like, it's not a bad product. It's great. I just don't want to spend that much money on it.

[00:23:11.430] - Kate
Right.

[00:23:12.150] - Interviewer
And just being honest, just honesty always wins with your people.

[00:23:16.050] - Kate
It really does. And I don't care what your style is. Honesty is everyone's style?

[00:23:20.670] - Interviewer
Yes, absolutely.

[00:23:24.670] - Interviewer
So let me just see if I had any other questions I wrote down.

[00:23:28.510] - Interviewer
Oh, yes. So I wanted to know. So when you're doing those sort of timely promotions, whether it be a flash sale or Black Friday or an affiliate promotion, do you include or exclude people that are still in your nurture sequence.

[00:23:40.930] - Kate
I will exclude them. The only time that I probably wouldn't would be say Black Friday, but their sequence is going to be slightly different. Meaning if they signed up for my list. And I don't know when Black Friday is. I mean, does anyone in 2022 know when Black Friday is? I don't know, but I don't know what it is. However, if they're joining me on Thursday and not for a waitlist because I would have a waitlist for my Black Friday offer, right? And not for that, I would probably send them an email that word is slightly different. During all of my big launches, I have the Carly Simon email. We talk about it inside of your list, and that is like, hey, I just met you, right? And honestly, I felt like kind of a moneygrubbing loser, like telling you about this deal we just met. Nobody likes that. But then I realized you joined my list for a reason, and it was X, Y, and Z, and this product can actually do that for you. So this is the only email that you're going to get about it.

[00:24:40.390] - Kate
Hopefully you're actually seeing it because I know your inbox is bombarded. But if you want to check out more, click here. If you have actual questions, reply back. And so send those to those people who are new. What I really hate to see is say you are doing something that's more of a live launch style, and somebody will join. And then they might not necessarily, especially if you're a business to consumer, say you're doing like a five-day becoming a plant mom challenge, right? And somebody joins on that fifth day.

[00:25:11.170] - Kate
So technically, the only thing that they're going to get is the fifth day and then a whole bunch of sales emails afterwards, like, kind of let people know what's coming. So that way they can expect it. And they're not just like, this person is really pushing this plant corner. I just met them. What's going on? Some people will be all about it. But again, when you come at it from that sort of, look, I know we just met. You might have just joined the challenge. I just want to let you know, like, this is what's happening.

[00:25:37.450] - Kate
This is why on all of my master classes, I don't hide the fact that I'm going to tell you about my program. Why would I? Maybe, even I...

[00:25:45.970] - Interviewer
You are not selling. You are giving them an opportunity to get something that will help them?

[00:25:48.670] - Kate
Yeah, like in the business-to-consumer space too. Like, honesty, this is like, the one thing that I can preach, honesty and connection. This is where we're going for here. Like, hey, guys, just so you know, I'm going to be telling you about this course. So if you want a little extra help and if you want access to me and you're tired of falling off the wagon, you're going to hear about something paid. I'm telling you this now. So that way you don't have to be like, where's the other shooter drop? What's going on here.

[00:26:10.150] - Kate
So you just focus on whatever the good free stuff is and then make a decision if you want to come hang out with me more, and they will appreciate it.

[00:26:17.950] - Interviewer
I always love all the examples you give. We got plant moms, we've got crochet.

[00:26:22.630] - Kate
My audience is the coolest. I will get some people that are business to business. Usually they end up turning into copywriters for a while, which is really funny after going through love realist, which is totally cool. I love it because they get so good at it. But we have so many [inaudible 00:26:38] finish. We have a lot of artists. We have someone who's teaching personal chefs. We have another person who's doing sugar cookies. It's the coolest things ever. And again, treating people like people works. And I'm not about super aggressive tactics.

[00:26:53.530] - Kate
Like, you can get away with a lot when you sell business to business, like bloggers to other bloggers, marketers to other marketers, coaches to coaches. You coach coaches. You can be on there. But if you're trying to do that to like, a normal consumer, people will dislike you.

[00:27:10.450] - Interviewer
Yeah. Think of it as like, I feel like when you start blogging, you know what affiliate marketing is? You know all these things. And if your sister or your friend is like, what are you doing and you're like, oh, I'm blogging. They're like, what does that mean? So you got to think of, like, the people who don't have any clue what you're doing and talk to them if that's your audience.

[00:27:30.070] - Kate
100%. But again, if you can always show somebody how something is going to make their life easier. How it's going to help them to avoid something? And then again, in our cases, because again, we value honesty, letting them know about any shortcomings, then they'll be all good. Again, what is this? How is it different? Buy right now? Those are really the three questions that you need to be answering.

[00:27:52.870] - Interviewer
Yes, I like it. All right. So let's wrap up. I believe you have a freebie for our audience.

[00:27:59.350] - Kate
Sure. So, I know that we have talked about this for a little bit about what do I actually send? And sometimes human brains just need concrete ideas, even if you do not even use them. So we have my two years worth of email ideas. So if you had over on katedoster.com/bbsummit. So just niche things for you guys.

[00:28:19.610] - Kate
katedoster.com/bbsummit. You're going to get my two years worth of strategically planned email ideas. And what I mean, strategic is at least one email that month is going to be a moneymaker. Technically, you can tag on a sales pitch any of the emails that you're going to get for that month. But it's not just like, here's a list of 104 emails, go pick it out. You're like, this is like, no, it's January. You're sending us week one, week two, week three. If you're watching this and you're like, but Kate it's June turns out that January comes back, so you are fine.

[00:28:50.390] - Kate
Just go back. You are good. You're not missing out. Things aren't going to fail and then go from there. I have some students who like to use it verbatim. I have some people, like, to pick and choose or be like, oh, yeah, you said to share, like, three mistakes about this, which actually reminded me about something that I saw online. It was just awful.

[00:29:06.530] - Kate
So then I talked about that instead. Again, just giving your brain something to work with makes it so much easier than, like, I have to write everything in a mail of emails too. It's four. Oh, I need to share some tools, some mistakes, a blog post. And I need to talk about something that's an affiliate one. I can do that. And I can shove in whatever order I want.

[00:29:26.870] - Interviewer
I'm sitting here and being like, okay, I need to go back and look at that because it is really good. I like that broken up by month, and I was like, I should really do that. My newsletters, I'm like, here's the new stuff. I've had a lot going on.

[00:29:39.590] - Kate
Right. And again for you, it's really nice. I don't want to say it's easier for me to be, because it's not. I think that it's really great because good consumer based emails, again, everything besides blogging about blogging I feel are so hard to come by at this point. It's almost like shooting fish in a barrel in that case. But this is when you're like, hey, guys, today I was recording this podcast episode for the Summit and can I just tell you like, I have been overwhelmed? Thank goodness.

[00:30:01.550] - Kate
I've got... To click off a sauna, whichever one you like, whichever one you're affiliate for, because it's keeping me organized because it is a hot mess. And I want to know, like, what are you hot messing about right now? How's your quarter for? That's it. So they can be like, oh, my God. I thought I was the only one who didn't have my act together. So exciting that you do. Let me go check this out, and that's all your email needs to be, which is really nice. Why?

[00:30:22.670] - Kate
Just like we've said before, being on your list is a privilege. You're going to attract people that are like you. I mean, they won't have to be as obsessed with Harry Potter as you are, but pretty close. So when you can relate Harry Potter to whatever is currently going on in your life, chances are they're going to want to hear about it, too. 

[00:30:40.310] - Interviewer
Yes. All right. Awesome, guys.

[00:30:41.750] - Interviewer
Definitely go get that. So, katedoster.com/bbsummit. I'm telling you, it is excellent. I refer back to all the stuff I've gotten from Kate all the time. I've got it turned out in notebooks because my brain just works better that way. I'm sorry to the trees. Kate, thank you so much for being here. Any final words?

[00:31:03.110] - Kate
Definitely get the all access pass. If you guys haven't done that or the pro one, they're both amazing. I have to say, you have so many great speakers. I know I'm like, which ones do? [inaudible 00:31:12] 

[00:31:16.850] - Kate
So exciting. That's really great to do that. Do not be afraid to email your list. I know that this is if I can boil it down to anything, it's always when it comes to email marketing and honestly, sales-list growth in general, all of it. Do the brave thing. There's nothing brave about creating four Pinterest graphics. There's something brave about going and asking somebody in the BB Facebook group - hey, who wants to do a freebie spot with me? It is telling your list, hey, I've got this $17 offer.

[00:31:48.590] - Kate
Do the brave thing. When you default to that, the growth you're going to see is exponential. Exponential! Do the brave thing. 

[00:31:58.490] - Interviewer
Yes. Awesome. Thank you, guys. We will catch you at the next session.

[00:00:03.650] - Liz Stapleton
All right, guys. I'm really excited to have this speaker back. I always love it when she agrees to be part of the summit because she always brings so much value and so much just energy. That is... It makes me happy. So she is the host of the Do the Brave Thing online business podcast. It's her soul and her soul's mission to put money in the hands of good with people so they can do good with it while eradicating the idea that nice people always finish last in business. She shares spam or face-free sales techniques that even your grandma would be proud of you for using. A big warm welcome back to Kate Doster. Kate, thank you so much for coming back again.

[00:00:41.860] - Kate Doster
I am super excited to be here. I absolutely love the events that you put on. They're so amazing. And the Swag bag and the All Access Pass, you always go all out, which is why any time I see that you're doing one, I'm like, Can I be in it?

[00:00:54.890] - Liz Stapleton
And the answer is always yes. I'm excited. We're going to talk about A few different things today. We're going to talk about email trends because there's always shiny things that people are chasing after, strategies or whatever that I want to be like, what's working now versus what is foundational needs to say. Then we're also going to talk about some sales mindset stuff, which I think is always a bigger hurdle than people realize. Let's start with what with email marketing has evolved most over the last couple of years. How has it changed?

[00:01:30.960] - Kate Doster
I think that how it's changed is a little bit... It goes more into sales of the buyer cycle. There used to be a time back in 2020, 2019, 2018, where you could put together essentially an auto webinar funnel, slap together four emails, and you could sell $2,000 courses every single day, every single day. That would be what's considered a front-end offer. Just immediately go into it and it would work so well. Now, people, regardless of industry, while they are still buying stuff, it is a much longer buyer cycle. It might be one of those things for people that have been, I know it's a more advanced tactic, but if they have been using the traditional automated webinar system, they might not be seeing that return on investment like they used to have and be like, Well, why isn't this converting? Well, everyone is starved for time. Everyone is starved for attention, regardless of what industry you're in. Especially if you're in B2B, everyone knows what's coming. So you would need to make sure that that is actually spectacular. When you're thinking of it, it's like, yes, you can still have one on the front-end. We still one on the front-end, just in case if people want to sign up for it anytime when it's available.

[00:02:35.170] - Kate Doster
But it's about thinking like, okay, maybe I should get some people with their foot in the door first, whether it is through a freebie that is a PDF or maybe just like, A traditional mini course. You can have videos, not have videos, not necessarily a hard pitch, 90-minute webinar because people just aren't going to sit through them like they used to. Then it's like, Okay, can you get them into that next step of that live masterclass? Or of that automated webinar system that you have set up. So that's the thing that you're thinking of. Another thing to just really think about is just being authentic with people. And I know we're going to talk about this later, but about not being afraid to remind people about the stuff that you have to actually offer. And so, yes, you're going to have to talk about stuff more, not only more than you used to, but you are going to have to bring up stuff more often. And again, I don't want to say that it takes necessarily a little bit more work, but it's just that you need to have a a lot more of you, which I know we've always encouraged.

[00:03:33.470] - Kate Doster
And it's like, she who knows her audience best is going to win. So you want to make sure that the content that you're sending people really does speak to those aspirations, those objections, those pain points, and that they just don't sound like generic bull crap. They're very, very specific.

[00:03:49.850] - Liz Stapleton
Yeah, I like that. Okay, so that's really a point, and it has me rethinking my webinar. But okay, so that's because attention spans are so short. But what's some foundational strategies that work just as well now as they did five years ago? What should people really make sure they've foundationally set because it continues to work?

[00:04:12.580] - Kate Doster
I think that making sure that, and I will say this odd, but making sure that things make sense together. Say that you do want to put together a freebie, again, regardless of what medium it is, that ultimately it's going to lead either to a smaller product or a bigger product, so they just make sense together. And that's one thing that I've always talked about, especially, say, if you're going to sell on your thank you page because those still work, the tripwire concept, it still does. You can't have a freebie that's a Pinterest free mini course, and then you're trying to sell a Pinterest course immediately right after because people are going to think my Pinterest course already got solved. Where it's like, okay, so I still want this front-end Pinterest mini course because I want people to be able to see me and hear me and all this other stuff. It's like, well, in order to make Pinterest work, you do at this stage of the game, you need to have a lot of content. Here are 100 printable templates for seven bucks, right? It's like this can work really well. And that has always been the case is that you need to think to yourself like, okay, what would that next step be?

[00:05:13.600] - Kate Doster
And you might not have all the steps built. I think that's where people get jumbled up. It's like, Oh, well, I don't know what freebie to have. It's like, I don't know what lower ticket to offer. I don't have a big ticket offer. Now, calm down, calm down. Go ahead and you can just go ahead. What piece do you have already? It's like you might not have, say, that lower ticket offer yet or even the higher one, but you're going to start with the people or the problem that you ultimately want to solve, and you're going to create a freebie around that. Then when you do have that smaller offer, you can pitch it to everyone who's already on your list. You want to do it at an intro level or a flash a level price, you can go ahead and then put it up to what it normally is at and then add it into your welcome series, add it into your funnels. Those things can work really well. I think that sometimes we just forgot. I also think- Overcomplicate it. Yeah. You don't necessarily need to overcomplicate it. I also think that there is great value, just like there's always been in showing up, if you can, weekly.

[00:06:15.220] - Kate Doster
If you miss a week here and there, it's not the end of the world. I don't want to be like, Oh, man, I missed last Thursday. My whole month is shot. Just go ahead and send the email. Just go ahead and send it.

[00:06:27.210] - Liz Stapleton
They're thinking more about it than they're thinking about it.

[00:06:30.450] - Kate Doster
Exactly. They're not being like, Oh, my goodness, it's Thursday. I mean, you might have some super fans, but no one's going to be like, Oh, you sent me an email on a Tuesday instead of last Wednesday. They're just going to be like, Oh, okay, whatever. I think that we always think that people are watching us a lot closer than we actually are. I think, again, just showing up. Really, regardless if you have a personal brand or even, say, a company, I think because everyone, like I said, is really thinking about where their dollars are at, really being able to build that personal connection is huge, which is why I'll still tell my students or I'll even tell the contributors in my bundle, Put your face in your emails. Occasionally, just send a video. Can we send that? Can we just made a loom if you don't feel like particularly typing that day. Just give them something so they can hear you and they can see you and they can put a name to the face.

[00:07:21.620] - Liz Stapleton
Yes, I like that. I'm guilty of not doing that as well because I do the summit. Then I think last year, I think I only taught the implementation implementation sessions. So I feel like there was a little bit like, Who's this lady? And it's like, Oh, no, I hosted the whole thing. But yeah, so I think that's why it didn't panel, I guess. But okay. All right, moving on because we're going to try to cover a lot. So as you touched on already, we need to be more sales minded, in a sense, without being gross, but attention span are down. So are plain text emails the way to go? Visual branded templates. What How do you actually get attention in the inbox? What's working?

[00:08:04.160] - Kate Doster
I think that you can try out a variety of things. I think that people just think like, Oh, once I do this one thing, I'm stuck on pigeon hole forever. You can try just doing a text-based email. I will say if you're going to do primarily text-based, which is what I do. I don't necessarily use templates per se. Make sure there is still something visual in it. There can be a button, that's fine. I love having pictures, especially say, even if you're trying to... You have to sell the click regardless if you're going to free or paid. I think that people forget that. If you're sending people to a blog post or to a podcast episode, actually put a mockup of what that blog post looks like. Again, take a screenshot, go over to Canva, shove it in there, put that image in there. People love clicking on pictures. Make sure that picture is linked so that way it's going wherever it's going. Because if people just see walls of text, you're 100% correct, they're just going to phase out. But again, you can start a gift in there, just something in the middle to feel like, okay.

[00:09:00.430] - Liz Stapleton
Make it skimmable, use bold. It's spacing. There's this one person that I'm on their email list and I'm about ready to unsubscribe because I never read their emails. I open it, I'm like, Okay, there's that big header image, and then everything else is just text. I'm like, what is this even about? I can't at a glance tell. It's driving me nuts. I'm tempted to email back and be like, Could you just... But it's not my business like this. It's their business.

[00:09:22.600] - Liz Stapleton
I don't want to do unwarranted thoughts because maybe someone else absolutely loves it like that.

[00:09:27.440] - Liz Stapleton
Everyone's different.

[00:09:28.540] - Kate Doster
I think Yeah, making it skimmable. I think that people think that, Oh, I either have to, and this is one of the things we were talking about before we hopped on, Oh, you either have to run a flash sale with a discount or you have to do a big Amy Porterfield style launch multiple days, eight gajillion emails, 12 webinars, private podcast, all that. Those are the only two ways to make a sale. I think that you forget you can just casually talk about your products and services in your actual emails. Technically, you could talk about the same thing every single week in a completely different way. It could be one of those things. Say you have a mastermind that has open enrollment. Chances are somebody in there is asking you a question about something. That can be a theme of one of your emails. The other day, I was chatting with Patty in your super awesome mastermind. It's just the name and you're just going to link it. Again, I think people forget that all the best practices that you use and say blog post, you can use an email. You know how you hyperlink to related things?

[00:10:30.250] - Kate Doster
Hyperlink to related things. You don't necessarily always have to have a call to action to be like, Come here to check out our amazing mastermind. Again, you have the name, Sally. You have her question. If you have a screenshot of that question, even better, you can shove it in there. And guess what? You can make that clickable because people love clicking on pictures. Answer the questions and now everybody knows what's going on. And then you have a choice. Do you want your call to action after, again, you answered Sally's question in your email and to her in your group? You can have the call to Have you ever felt this way when it comes to trying to get your house clean? Hey, reply and let me know if you want to build more connection. If not, you can have a call to action because they still work. And if you are also tired of getting hit in the face with cereal boxes because it turns out that the Sock Gremlin isn't actually the thing that's holding you down because maybe Sally's question was about socks, then we would love to have you inside of the Mastermind.

[00:11:25.040] - Kate Doster
We do these weekly calls. Again, you can talk about it a lot. There are simple ways to to casually sell your list where you'll see this now it's become really popular. I do think that it works for what I like to call McDonald's money. I don't think that it's necessarily going to net you thousands and thousands of thousands unless your list is huge. But at the bottom of your email, you can have a little bit of what I'm working on section. It's usually the three things that you've got going on. I was like, Oh, so you can have whatever your email is about, things that are working. Oh, I just recorded a new lesson for the mastermind. Again, a little talk about it, click over here. They can go to there. You can talk about an affiliate offer. They can go over there. All those sorts of things. You can casually remind people about the stuff that you have. Occasionally, we'll send out one of whatever the top sellers were that week. We'll have a top seller section. It just depends on what we feel like. Now, if you were doing a giant launch, obviously, you wouldn't shove in these other little micro sales things, micro reminders, but it can just work really well.

[00:12:28.810] - Kate Doster
Again, you can relate it to anything. Again, I think people think they can talk about a product if they're launching it or if there's something special going on. No. Especially if you have something seasonal and even not seasonal, just any reason to talk about it, talk about it.

[00:12:43.510] - Liz Stapleton
Guys, talk If you guys are watching this and you are on my email list in the fall, you will probably have seen, Oh, hey, I just recorded a session for the summit with Kate Doster. Oh, I just finished editing six different sessions, and this is what my takeaways were. You're going to see, you would have seen that. If you weren't and you continue to be on my list come next fall when I am prepping for the next summit, you will see that too. Because it's just pulled from every day. That's great. That takes me to my next question of being personal about it. But a lot of people are using AI for everything. I feel like I'm not seeing it so much in the email marketing space. Although I will say I do use it to draft my podcast promo emails. But I'm just curious, your thoughts on AI in the email marketing space. To what extent do you use it? To what extent would you use it? Where is it too much?

[00:13:43.340] - Kate Doster
I think that it probably is, but we don't run in those circles. We're not really bro-y. I guarantee you there's a bro person who also loves private selling rights with affiliates on affiliates on affiliates, clickbank people that are just like,. But that's just not our style. Again, people can see through that. I think that sometimes we forget that. The way that I, and I call him Chad because your girls got dyslexia, so sometimes ChatGPT, the letters get mixed up. So we're like, Who's Chad? Who is she talking about? It's Chad. I like to have Chad up. What I always tell my students, I have a mini course about this too, is to use it when you hit your stumbling block. So what part of your newsletter is tripping you up? That's just like red stop sign it. If you can't think of a subject line, then be like, Hey, Chad, I want to write an email about who's going to help blank. What are four different subject lines that I can use? They're under eight words, go. And then it's like, Okay, so now he's given it right. If you already have that email written because maybe you saved the subject lines for last.

[00:14:51.540] - Kate Doster
Put that in there. Yeah. Put the email in there. Like, Hey, Chad, based on this email, pretend that you are an email marketing expert. Give me, I wouldn't say 15, but analysis, analysis, give me eight subject lines with different formats that are going to get people to open it. Some of the ways that I will write it because I am such a talker-

[00:15:11.590] - Liz Stapleton
Sometimes I combine two or three of the answers I get. Yeah.

[00:15:15.050] - Kate Doster
And because I've got the ADHD and I tend to be an over-explainer, I am the exact opposite of concise. My friend Becky Beach, very concise. My friend Jess from Jess Creatives, super concise. Not your girl at all. I am very, very wordy. So sometimes, especially if it's directions, I will take whatever Kate is in my half, and then I will ask it, make this paragraph more concise. Or if it's one of those I do, sometimes I have my assistant proofread stuff, sometimes I'll have my Mac to voice to text back to it, but sometimes I will put it in chat and be like, Can you proof this for me? And so he'll make sure if I forgot the word and somewhere or if I put the wrong version of your in there, then he's going to change it over.

[00:15:53.710] - Kate Doster
So it's like, okay, it's just this little polishing touches. Or if you're just like, I really I don't want to say, Click here to join the mastermind. That just seems very blah, right? Then you can ask it. I would never... This is just me personally, and I feel like a lot of my people also feel it's really disingenuous. I would never be like, Hey, I want to promote my mastermind today. Write an email about it. The only time that I use Chad to say, Write a promotional style of email, is if it's going to some type of contributor or an affiliate, because most of those, they have to be pretty generic, everyone's style. Now, for example, at the time of this recording, because we're recording a little bit early, we're running a Halloween-themed event. One of the swipe files of emails that I wrote was very Halloween punny. But I made sure that everyone's going to get their brand to say that this is spooktacular and it's a business boosting resource. It's like, they're not all going to want to say that. It's like, Okay, can you write a more straightforward, here are the big details of the event, here's what's going on.

[00:16:57.730] - Kate Doster
That way it's like, oh, okay. Then you I take the email. I never just cut and paste it into a Google Doc. I'm always going to go ahead and alter it, still put my own flavor on there, but I'm not starting at zero. So I think that that is a really good place to start. Or if you're like, say you don't hang out with myself or a friend of everyone, Liz Wilcox. We love Liz as well.

[00:17:18.720] - Liz Stapleton
She's also speaking at the summit.

[00:17:21.120] - Kate Doster
If you don't know what to say, and I don't know if she's talking about welcome series, then now she'll talk about welcome series. But say for some freak reason, you didn't have my templates for a welcome series. You didn't have Liz's templates for a welcome series. Then you're going to be like, Okay, so I want to create a four-part Welcome Series. Here's some of the topics. What topic should I put in there? Again, sometimes it's going to be garbage, but sometimes, just like you said, it's going to spark an idea. That is where I would use AI. I would never have AI be like, Hey, can you write me a seven-part launch sequence for this course? It targets this. Here's an excuse. Go. Because I guarantee you, four or five of those emails are going to say the exact same thing. Just with the different amount of rocket emojis that it seems to show in there.

[00:18:04.950] - Liz Stapleton
I'm like, Don't add emojis.

[00:18:08.170] - Kate Doster
Yes, I have to tell no exclamation points. Something that is, I guess it's creepy, but I'm like, It's just the way It is. Sometimes, if you've been on the internet for as long as we have, you can pretend you're, and I can be like, In the style of Kate Doster, this is me writing it. It's like, Write it. Sometimes it's ridiculously far off. Sometimes I just think it's funny and I want to see. I'm like, I don't ever use exclamation points. What are you doing? Where are you scraping this from the internet that you think that you can find these things? But it can be fun that way. Again, if you wear, where are you stuck? Again, call it action. Is it subject lines?

[00:18:46.160] - Liz Stapleton
It's my go-to for avoiding blank pages.

[00:18:49.140] - Kate Doster
That's 100% can help you out. It's just like, Oh, all right. Thanks. Same thing, again, I'm sure we have other people talk about it, too. With blog posts or outlines of content as well, it can be that. Like you had said, I use it all the time for show notes, especially if I have interviews, I get the transcription from River.

[00:19:09.930] - Liz Stapleton
Repurposing transcripts with AI is like...

[00:19:13.200] - Kate Doster
Can you summarize this? Sometimes, I always have my notes for my calls. Sometimes I'll make sure I put in there. Sometimes I'll pick out boring things. I'm like, What? That was great. But again, it alleviates that thing. I want you to ask yourself, Why aren't I emailing your list? We talked about a lot of mechanical things. I don't have any ideas. I don't know how to word this. I don't know how else to talk about this product. But if the issue is that you are scared or embarrassed, then Chad's not going to help with that. You have to think to yourself, people are excited to read my emails. Are you going to have some people that are just going to be like, Oh, my inbox is too full? Yeah, but they probably were never going to buy from you ever. But I always like to think because people go to their inbox for a distraction. They're going for a dopamine hit. I'm like, I want to be that dopamine hit for that person. So they'll learn when my name pops up, I don't even have to worry about the subject line anymore because they're just going to be like, Oh, it's Kate, and they're just going to see what's going on.

[00:20:08.070] - Kate Doster
And that's where we all want to go. And you get by that by building that personal connection, by showing up consistently. Again, it does not need to be every day. It does not need to be twice a week. Sometimes it can be text-based. Sometimes you can do a newsletter style. You can mix it up. You're the boss. Don't forget that. It's okay.

[00:20:26.770] - Liz Stapleton
All right. I want to go back to something you said. You just said, They're probably not going to buy I'm going to get away from you anyway. Scrubbing your list. I feel like I have over scrubbed in recent years, and so I'm trying to... Instead of doing quarterly, maybe just twice a year, do you still scrub your list? How often are you doing it? What is your viewpoint on scrubbing a list?

[00:20:46.830] - Kate Doster
I think that it can be really smart. I think it can be really painful for people because they're like, I spent so much time, and it's a vanity number that people perceive as not a vanity number because I was like, Oh, you make $42 per this and all that stuff when it comes to email. But it's one of those things. If you have, and I don't want to call people dead weight because they are people, but if you have a lot of people that aren't-

[00:21:11.510] - Liz Stapleton
You're paying for them.

[00:21:12.890] - Kate Doster
Or they aren't interacting with your stuff, not only are you paying for them, but it's dragging down your reputation. I don't know how... Because somebody asked me, I don't know how things like Gmail and Outlook know your send a reputation because everyone gets one, but they do. They're going to know. It's going to help. Is this person going in to spam more often? All of us usually get into promotions. Are you going into promotions? Are you going into update? There's a whole thing called deliverability, which is really techy, so we won't get into that thing. Having all those people on your list can do it.

[00:21:46.090] - Kate Doster
But here's the other aspect of it. Say if you have 20,000 people on your list, but 5,000 just aren't really... They're not really doing much. And you're like, Oh, my open rates are in the tank. They're awful. Math, everyone. Open rates are a ratio. So if you get rid of those 5,000 people that aren't interacting, that don't want to stay around, and we'll talk about getting rid of them in a second. If now you're only sending, say, 10,000 people, say we start at 15 for that example, and you're getting literally the same amount of people opening because now your ratios are different, now your open rates are up, now your click-through rates are up, you automatically helped that metric because you're talking about it. I don't necessarily just automatically delete people.

[00:22:28.870] - Liz Stapleton
No, I tried to reengage first. Yeah.

[00:22:30.980] - Kate Doster
You can set it up. Kit, as they're now called, they do have a code automation. If you just search Kit or Convert Kit cold Subscriber, they have a template that you can use to reput people into it. Now, before they didn't, but now they have a capability where they can just unsubscribe people for you at the end. That way you don't have to worry about it.

[00:22:54.450] - Liz Stapleton
The biggest thing with that, guys, is so huge.

[00:23:00.080] - Kate Doster
The reason why I don't want you just deleting people. On mobile, all of them now, it used to be Android, but Apple is the same way. There is a very hard time for your email service provider who will be able to tell that your email got opened. There is this invisible pixel that gets sent. It's essentially a picture. When the email gets open, it's usually on desktop, unless you have a lot of privacy settings on, which we'll talk about, it pings back to, Kit, oh, Sally opened your email. But if they're on mobile, it usually gets blocked. If it's on Android, it usually gets blocked. Sally could be opening your emails every single week, but for whatever reason, say she's not clicking or she's not replying, because we know those are harder to get for people to get them out of their inbox. You might delete somebody who was in three months.

[00:23:44.160] - Liz Stapleton
That's where I think I've done too much.

[00:23:46.840] - Kate Doster
I make sure when I'm doing that reengagement campaign, I always make sure that first email is just something that I just know people like, like list building stuff. But by the time it's time to get rid of them, Every time it's like, Hey, I don't know if you like these emails or not, so I need you to either click on this link or reply. And if not, that's fine. This will be the last email and we'll get rid of you because it's those actions. So I wouldn't be like, Okay, even on that first email that you know is our crowd favorite, where you have a lot of links for people to click. Maybe some people like to offer a discount code. I don't necessarily teach that, but you might want to. I'd rather reward people that are active, personally. But it's up to you. It's up to If that's how you want to get somebody to get action, but have them reply back with something simple. Not like, Oh, what are you struggling with when it comes to your Facebook ads? Because that's going to take so much. Literally, it's like, And if Facebook has been really piss me off, really, hit reply, just give me a yes.

[00:24:46.800] - Kate Doster
Again, that way people will be more likely to just hit reply and say yes. Now, technically, you can start a conversation with that person, which is awesome. But now your email service provider knows, Oh, oh, For a while, we were keeping people on our list, and you might have done this with the summit as well. We'll give you an option because we run a lot of bundles and even with our products, like, Oh, do you just want product or bundle-based emails? And so not a lot of people checked that box, but some ended up being a couple of thousand. And I'm like, Oh, I need to keep them in here because what if I ever need to reach them again? But then it dawned on me. I'm like, You have all that data other places. And especially for a freebie, like that's fine. But if somebody has paid me money or they're in my Thrive Learn account, they're in my Thrive account, I can always export that list. If I need to tell them that we're moving platforms, that's truly the only thing that I would need to be able to tell them. I can take that.

[00:25:44.400] - Kate Doster
I can upload it to either in Convert kit for that final time, or I have my backup account, which is MailerLite, email them, let them know, Hey, I want to let you know we're moving this account. Don't worry, you haven't been out of my newsletters if you're not already getting them, and then you can delete them afterwards. I'm like, I don't want to say there's no reason to keep those people around, but there's technically- Yeah, I do have a subscriber preference if you only want product updates.

[00:26:09.270] - Liz Stapleton
And they do stay on. But it pays off to scrub it. Like I said, I think I was just a little overzealous doing four times a year. Because I got being like, Why was I ever off your list? But as a result, when you look at kit because they have engagement subscriber scoring and stuff, 70% of my list is at five stars.

[00:26:33.250] - Kate Doster
That's great.

[00:26:34.220] - Liz Stapleton
I feel like others are just... It's important to scrub, but maybe once or twice a year max is what I want.

[00:26:41.730] - Kate Doster
That's what I say. I 100% Again, if you don't have it necessarily always going on in the background, and for a lot of people to be able to set that up, it's a lot less painful for them because I'm like, Oh, I'm getting rid of all of these people. Especially, guys, especially if you don't have it, have double opt-ins, which is 1,000% up to you. But a lot of people that sell on the thank you page, you need to just have a single opt-in because they'll be able to talk to that person again. Especially if you have a single opt-in, I would 1,000% clean your list, regardless of how painful it may be. We usually do ours in December if we needed to do a big one.

[00:27:20.340] - Liz Stapleton
Yeah, I like that. Okay, so moving on. We touched on subscriber preference and privacy. Are you seeing any... Because there's so many more data privacy, people are more aware of what their privacy rights are. Are you seeing any changes or adjustments in that that have been people are like, Why am I on this list?

[00:27:49.980] - Kate Doster
Not really, because I feel like a lot of people know and you should be reminding them and they have all that. I'm wondering for the people that are like, Hey, I I saw that you, you checked out this course. I'm wondering how those particular emails, and again, since I'm not a lawyer and I don't play on TV, I wonder how those work out for people. But it might be one of those things like, Yes. Again, I like to try to teach just simple things. Again, just show up. But yeah, it does make sense if you're seeing that somebody is really engaging with a particular product or really engaging with a thing, maybe they need a little bit of a special email to be able to send them over there. It's like, you can be creepy. Like, Hey, I know you were checking out this is a super awesome summit bundle. And you can say that, but you got to think to yourself, Okay, what objection would somebody have that did it? So maybe it's just like, instead of being like, Hey, I noticed you check this out, it is something like you just send an email to the people that click on that after a couple of days.

[00:28:48.600] - Kate Doster
That's more of a testimonial-based story. It's like, Hey, I want you to meet Susan. And how she did that. Or again, what would somebody have a big objection to when it comes to actually clicking that buy button? For my bundle course, it's like, I got to be like, Hey, I thought you were checking out collaboration caution. It might be like, I don't know. It might be an email about how to be able to make money on a long-term product upfront. Because that is an issue that people can have with summits, with bundles, especially if you're a B2B bundle, they work really well. But you got to pitch people four or five months out because all business owners usually have at least a 90-day plan in their calendar. It's like, I'm putting in all this work and now I'm not going to see the rewards for four or five months, but I need rewards now. I was like, Oh, you just send those people an extra email about those things.

[00:29:45.700] - Liz Stapleton
Absolutely.

[00:29:46.600] - Kate Doster
Okay, next question.

[00:29:48.520] - Liz Stapleton
Do you see any emerging email marketing trends that you think are going to shape how the next year or two in email marketing is?

[00:29:57.000] - Kate Doster
I am going to be really interested in AI. Again, I know the circles that we run into, it's not that big of a deal. But I think everybody is just interested. Again, it's not like things where Google is getting smart enough to be able to tell, Oh, this was an AI written, that a thing. It's not a person, but people are going to be able to tell. I think where I'm really interested, and I feel like this is more online sales than email, but because email is such the backbone of everything, it's really hard to differentiate the two. That's why we talk about both, is like those big launch processes. It's like, are those 15 emails that you're written, are they necessary? Are they actually effective? What is going on there? And again, because most There are still people that are buying those mid $1,000, $2,000 products, but it seems to be under $200 and then $5,000 and up, which is very different between buy-in coaching and those mid-things. I was like, You don't really need that much for something that's $200. I'll be very interested a lot more when people are integrating these casual selling techniques, how they are going to go.

[00:31:11.780] - Kate Doster
I think in the front end of things for list building because everywhere, I want to say everywhere that there's a lot more people out there. Because I was chatting with somebody else about it. I feel like because last year, 2024, was so hard for people, a lot of business owners just folded and left. They just gave up because their sales were down. I don't want to be like, Oh, if you are creating a freebie or lead magazine, it needs to be the absolute best thing ever. I do still think the same principle that I have literally taught since 2019 is the truth. Your freebie still needs to answer a very specific yeah, but that you've got going on. Now, getting eyeballs on it are going to be a little bit harder than it used to be. You can try to play the Instagram algorithm game. I never relied on SEO, but I know that is really hurting with Google having AI results because people just aren't going anywhere because they can just read it on Google. Again, so I think that getting in front of people might be a little bit more challenging. I feel like a lot of people are relying on ads, but I think that it's just...

[00:32:18.740] - Kate Doster
I know it sounds bad, but I just think of that it's fun just to be able to test things out, see what works, what's going on here. Are ads worth over time? Are they actually working? Is there things I like many chats? So we've been playing around with that. I definitely don't think it's worth it for the amount of attraction I actually get on Instagram. But I'm like, I'm willing to play around with it because I just think that it does offer a good user experience for people rather than just being like link in the bio. It's like, do they actually go back to their DMs to get the link that I gave them? Maybe, maybe not. But I think that that could be really interesting to see. Like, okay, how are you pairing those things together? I think that that can be really interesting.

[00:32:58.360] - Liz Stapleton
Yeah, I like it. All right. I know you have something for everyone that's watching this. Can you tell us about it? Sure.

[00:33:06.090] - Kate Doster
If you're like, all right, I do want to casually sell to my list. I know that I need to talk to them. And maybe Chad just is not giving you good ideas on what to chat about. Because I don't know. I tried being like, I teach this and I help that, give me 30 days worth of ideas for, say, Instagram. And it's always just like, Do a Q&A, highlight a customer. I'm like, This isn't getting my brand users going. This isn't going to I have two years worth of email ideas. So these are actually really specific prompts that you can use in sentence letters to be able to write your emails. And if you want to weave in some casual pitching, you can. If you don't want to weave in casual pitching in any other way, you can. You can head over to katedoster.Com/twoyears. Basically, you don't have to worry about it until, what, 2027 at this point? For what do I write this week? Because it's all there. Instead of just being like, Here's two years worth of stuff which is bullet pointed because my brain can't do that. I literally mapped it out like, first week of May, second week of May, fourth week of May.

[00:34:07.810] - Kate Doster
Then I'm like, If you hate these, go to a different month. You can't do National Donut Day when it's not National Donut Day. But you can use some of the other prompts that we have. It's something that's just like, No, this month isn't going to be known for this. I'll let you know. But that works out really, really well. People really enjoy it. It's just something that they can just have on their desktop. They're like, Oh, okay. Definitely Go ahead and do that. I have to say, I do feel, especially if you're writing emails that just have one call to action a couple of different times, which just don't have one link at the bottom, guys. Links stop one thing a bunch of times. I think that those can work really well still on Instagram, Instagram captions. I think you think, Oh, if I'm sending this newsletter to my list, it has to be exclusive to them. It doesn't necessarily have to be exclusive to them. If you're like, Oh, but the only people that follow me on social are the people that are on my list anyways. I don't know if you want to look at your algorithm lately, but only 2% of people are actually seeing your stuff anyways.

[00:35:03.420] - Kate Doster
Usually, people don't act on things the first time anyways. I feel like you can do a lot of really great repurposing with your emails. It just doesn't have to be like, Oh, my goodness, I spent two hours on this. You can use it other places, too.

[00:35:17.580] - Liz Stapleton
Yeah, absolutely. All right. That's fantastic, guys. The link is on this page. Kate, thank you again so much for joining me for the summit and sharing your awesome knowledge. You always bring a great perspective and make me think about things. So thank you so much.

[00:35:31.450] - Kate Doster
Thank you so much for having me. And guys, if you didn't get the all access pass, you 1,000% should. Not only because these presentations have just been great. I'm taking all these notes, my hand hurts. But there's some amazing stuff that you're going to get for the creators, too, to be able to just help you take action. Because that's, I think, the biggest thing that Liz and I really preach. It's great for you all to hang out with us, and we love you. Tell us that you're hanging out with us. Send us those messages. Chat in the community. We want to know you all that you're watching this, but we need you to take action. That is the biggest thing. If you are overwhelmed, if you've been having anxiety, the only cure is to do something. You can't learn how to swim by reading a book. You got to get in the water. Just get in the water. And don't put too much pressure on yourself. You're not supposed to be Michael Phelps the first time that you're swimming. Just like when you launch something or your first newsletter, you cannot put all that pressure on a single email, on a single launch.

[00:36:21.540] - Kate Doster
Because just like my friend Faith Mariah says, there's always going to be another one. Yes. There's always another one.

[00:36:25.850] - Liz Stapleton
Also, speaking at the summit, if you guys didn't catch yourself, I don't know where in the schedule it's going to be, but yeah, no. There's always going to be another one. Get in the water, get yourself some floaties in the way of Kate's two years of emails to help you get started, and you'll get there.

**Transcript:**
[00:00:14.270] - Liz
What up? What up? That is in sync. This is Mountain Dew. I'm Liz Wilcox.

[00:00:21.110] - Liz
And you are watching the Blogger Breakthrough Summit. I'm so excited that I almost choked. Note. More specifically, you are now watching the presentation call grow your email list. A dozen plus ideas that don't involve ads.

[00:00:36.250] - Liz
I am wicked wicked excited. Tripping up my words. Just so you know, if you're watching this in bed right now, maybe it's early in the morning. You're just trying to you know see what's out there. I want you to know in this presentation, I'm going to hype you up, hype up the energy.

[00:00:56.430] - Liz
I've got sound effects. Yeah. Let's give you a round of applause. Let's give Liz a round of applause for hosting this event. And so I've got sound effects.

[00:01:07.570] - Liz
Anytime you hear this sound, that's when I want you to really pay attention, write something down. I don't want you to have to write a bunch of stuff down, but I do want you to pay attention at certain points. Okay. Today's agenda is, well, number one, why email marketing?

[00:01:25.350] - Liz
Chances are you're watching this? You're probably already semi quasi convinced. I want to give you a quick pep talk. I want to talk about why I'm qualified to talk about this. I promise that will be a short part.

[00:01:37.310] - Liz
And then I'm going to get into the right freebie and how to get people on your list. Sounds good. Sounds good. And let's have some fun. I used to have a lot more sound effects.

[00:01:48.720] - Liz
So, you got lucky today. Let's get into my main objective for you today, though. Okay, so in general, anytime I give a presentation, all I want you to do is take what I've done and pick out what works best for you. That's why this talk is titled you know, A Dozen Plus Ideas. I don't want you to try a dozen plus ideas.

[00:02:08.870] - Liz
I don't want you to have to write everything down or try to do a bunch of stuff at once. I want you to just learn one thing. I want you to get excited about one thing, and then I want you to go do that. One thing. I believe in you.

[00:02:20.950] - Liz
I believe in your creativity. I believe in your ability to do one thing at a time that makes sense for you. You don't need my permission to deviate from this. This is just the push you need to get started.

[00:02:35.230] - Liz
Okay. Sounds good. I've got a picture of Kevin Hart here because I love this story. Kevin Hart, if you read his autobiography, you'll see how he got so big.

[00:02:46.210] - Liz
And that was because of email marketing. Now, how did the comedian use email marketing to become this giant mobile megastar that he is today? Well, I've got the sticky notes here. So, every time he would go to a new show, a new venue. You know there's hundreds, thousands of comedians out there competing for the same venues, the same cities the same audiences, people that go out and listen to comedy at clubs.

[00:03:14.830] - Liz
Right. And so, every time he would go to a new venue, a new show, he had something like this, like a note card. Right. And he would put one at every seat. And he'd say, if you like the show, please fill this out with your name and your email address.

[00:03:29.140] - Liz
Next time I you know come to Destiny. Next time I come to Detroit. Next time I come to Milwaukee, whatever you'll be the first to know. And that's how he was able to impress bookies, impress people's bookies that's like a gambling thing, right?

[00:03:46.170] - Liz
He could impress the venues. He could sell out, and he could get bigger and bigger and all started with email marketing. So, whatever your business is, whatever kind of blog you have, I promise you can make email marketing work for you. Alright, let's get into the pet talk. This is what I want you to write down.

[00:04:02.930] - Liz
List building is essential to my business. Now pause this and write it down because I'm going to keep going. Here's another one. I want you to write down. List building is a money making activity.

[00:04:14.280] - Liz
It might not seem that way, but it totally is. You can make money from your email. Look at that Kevin Hart thing like, holy crap. Who would think a comedian could use email marketing? I promise you, blogging is much more simple.

[00:04:26.380] - Liz
Okay, moving on. The last thing I want you to write down is list building isn't just about getting to the highest number possible. Okay. It's all about finding quality leads, and I am going to show you how to do that. Okay, so I need to remove this.

[00:04:49.950] - Liz
Why am I qualified to talk about this? You can see I was practicing, and not everything is perfect. Do things even when they're not perfect, that's a side note. Okay, so why am I qualified to talk about this?

[00:05:02.820] - Liz
First of all, LizWilcox.com, the Liz Wilcox branding. You see, today, this is actually my third online business. I started out as a blogger, just like you. I started out as an RV travel blogger.

[00:05:15.390] - Liz
My blog was called The Virtual Campground, and I would go to summit like this. I would listen to podcast, go to the Webinars, and everyone and their mother kept telling me that I wish I would have taken my email marketing more seriously. I wish I would have built my list. If I would have built my list and taken it seriously. I would have made so much more money by now.

[00:05:37.020] - Liz
And these were people that were making so much money to me. Right? And so, Mama didn't raise no fool. I'm nothing if not an efficient chick. And so I said, okay, I'm going to build my list.

[00:05:47.680] - Liz
I'm going to make money with email marketing. And I did that with the Virtual campground. And I ended up building such a strong, healthy list. That when I launched my first digital course. I had 141 people on the waitlist, and by the end of Cart close, I had 141 sales.

[00:06:05.820] - Liz
Crazy. I went on to CoCreate a digital summit much like this called full Time Free and week. At the time of this recording, we just put it on the market for sale and we do a lot of sales through email marketing. We build our list throughout the year, not just when we are trying to you know do the summit. And so, I know a lot of list building about that too.

[00:06:28.220] - Liz
And then, of course, with lizwilcox.com, I have built my list up. I think there was a screenshot here. And as you can see and I'll talk more about this later. But slow growth is growth.

[00:06:42.750] - Liz
As you can see, I have been building my list for almost two years now and really nowadays, towards the right hand side, you can see that. Not a day goes by that my email doesn't get new people on the list. So, real quick, I just want to go through a few quick 'do nots'.

[00:07:03.500] - Liz
I do not want you to think that you have to have multiple freebies. I know, as bloggers were often taught content upgrades, you write a blog post, you write a specific freebie for that blog post, right? You don't necessarily have to do that. I don't want you to stress over paid ads, like the title of the talk goes. I'm not going to share any paid ad strategies. Chances are that you work really hard for your money, and maybe you're not ready to give it to Mark Zuckerberg and Facebook and Google just yet.

[00:07:37.730] - Liz
Right. So, I'm going to give you strategies that are tried and true that don't involve you paying money. And I don't want you to give up. This is a long term strategy. Let's go back to this and I'll talk more and more about this.

[00:07:50.780] - Liz
But look at this. This is from, let's see. Let me move in January, 2021 to the time of this recording around mid November. And as you can see, there was a spike there that it was small, small. You can see in these summer months it was like nil, right?

[00:08:05.930] - Liz
Almost nothing. And then now look at it. These last few months, it's been crazy awesome for me. I don't want you to give up. Okay.

[00:08:14.720] - Liz
List building is a long term strategy, but it builds high dividends. Remember, list building as a long term strategy that brings huge dividends. Okay. Instead of all that, I want you to just create one great freebie. Okay?

[00:08:32.600] - Liz
I want you to put it and yourself, you've got to put yourself out there. Look at me right now with this loud colors and sink in the background. Look at my rainbow glasses. Right?

[00:08:41.520] - Liz
I'm really putting myself out there for you. Right? And again, I already mentioned this because it's just so dang important. I want you to recognize that slow growth is still there. It's still growth.

[00:08:54.200] - Liz
Even you know think of the tortoise and the hare, right? We all want to be the hare. We all want to just go, go, go, get it done. Reach 10,000 subscribers, reach our 1st 100. But the reality is we're more like the tortoise in that it's just one step at a time.

[00:09:09.640] - Liz
And then it slowly turns into a snowball and we win in the end. Okay, so how do we do that? Here's the show time. Anybody else a Will Smith fan? I'm a huge Will Smith fan.

[00:09:22.090] - Liz
You can call me the fresh princess of email. Okay, so job number one, create a great freebie. Here's how we're going to do that. Okay, so the offer. Think of your customer journey and work backward.

[00:09:37.040] - Liz
Okay. What's the very last step you want people to take? Now work backwards and think of those first little baby steps you want somebody to take. You can also look at what are people Googling? What are they searching for?

[00:09:48.350] - Liz
You can even go into Facebook groups and see what people are talking about. And then what format is easiest for people to digest? If you are working with single moms trying to meal prep, maybe don't create a five day course. Chances are they need something quick and fast. Right?

[00:10:04.240] - Liz
So, think about what format is easiest for them to digest. On the other hand, if you blog about microbiomes and people that want to learn more about them, a five day course might make more sense because they're spending time doing a lot of research. Right. The landing page I want you to create copy that stands out and copy stands out when it says a lot in as little words as possible. Brevity, write brevity down.

[00:10:29.130] - Liz
Okay. I want you to showcase your offer and your personality. People buy from people they trust. And of course, this is list building. We're not talking about buying just yet, but this is really the first step in your buyer's journey.

[00:10:41.070] - Liz
You've got to showcase not only your offer, not only your freebie, but your personality as well. Look at these slides right now. This is showing off my personality, right? Even though I'm not trying to sell you anything, I want you to talk directly to your ideal person. Don't make generalities talk directly to the person.

[00:10:59.090] - Liz
I'll show you an example in a second. And then when in doubt, I want you to just keep things simple. I always say I'm a two step chick. If it takes three steps, I'm out. Okay, embody that. The placement.

[00:11:10.590] - Liz
Put it on its own landing page. Of course, I'll show you that in a second. Its own landing page is when they either have to sign up or they have to exit out. Okay. Put your freebie on your home page three to five times. You want to collect emails because email marketing is lucrative as heck.

[00:11:26.590] - Liz
Okay, this is just the first step in that. So, make your home page kind of like a sales page for your freebie. Okay, you can put on your about page, your Sidebar inside blog posts, social media bios, basically always be promoting. Okay, now I'm going to share my screen and show you an example.

[00:11:46.880] - Liz
I've got the wrong thing pulled up. Forgive me. This is the landing page. We're showing a little preview right now, I think here's the preview.

[00:11:55.340] - Liz
Okay, so swipe swipe, baby. Right. And sorry, I just got to scroll down. You're a content creator. I am specifically talking to content creators.

[00:12:05.750] - Liz
If this person comes and they are an ecommerce, they know it's not for them, right? You're building your audience, blah, blah, just a little bit of context, and then I show them what is part of the freebie. Let me just move this up, so you can see it. Swipe, swipe, baby. Give me this.

[00:12:24.090] - Liz
Right. So, very, very simple landing page. Now I want to show you where I put it on the site. Let me make this a little bigger for you and so, you can see.

[00:12:35.430] - Liz
Let me move it over. Well, I'm not going to mess with it. So free email swipes. Boom. That's one way you can get my or that's one.

[00:12:44.800] - Liz
Ask. Here's another. Ask that's two right above the fold. Remember, your home page is basically a sales page for your freebie. We keep scrolling, scrolling, scrolling.

[00:12:55.810] - Liz
Sorry, if this is making you nauseous. As you can see, it's basically a sales page for my freebie. Now I finally got into it. Here is what I want you to know about my freebie. You're going to get a welcome sequence. Newsletter examples, 52 subject lines.

[00:13:09.370] - Liz
Remember, I'm thinking about the very first baby steps I want my customer to take if I want my customers to make $100,000 from email marketing, but they haven't even started yet. I want to make sure they've got a dang good welcome sequence. Right. And then as a bonus, you know they also need to know about newsletters and subject lines. So I'm going to give that as a bonus.

[00:13:28.060] - Liz
But basically, I want you to get that welcome sequence done. Boom, that's three places. Right. Let me move this on the way, we're scrolling, scrolling, scrolling down. Oops, you did it again.

[00:13:43.270] - Liz
There's another place to get my freebie. That's four. And then get your swipes. That's five places right there on the darn homepage where I'm asking you. Also, I said you can put it on your about page.

[00:13:56.360] - Liz
This is basically just another small, different way of approaching things where I'm asking you to or I'm leading into the swipe file. Right. So, I've got it. One, two, three places right here for you. Okay.

[00:14:13.510] - Liz
I hope that makes sense. Alright. Job number two, put it and yourself out there in fun ways. I already showed you my website. I think my website is pretty fun.

[00:14:22.980] - Liz
Like I said, basically, a sales page. I'm going to put a triangle noise on that basically a sales page for your freebie if you're doing it right. Especially as bloggers, even if you don't ever want to sell a digital product. But you know, you need more traffic. Then get the people that are coming to your blog on your email list, so you can consistently send them the new content you're creating and get repeat traffic.

[00:14:47.290] - Liz
I always say the best customer is a repeat customer. The best traffic is repeat traffic. Right. So, here's some ideas other than what I just showed you about you know putting it on your home page and stuff like that. So what was I talking about?

[00:15:03.000] - Liz
Put it and yourself out there in fun ways. Alright. So, I've broken it down into three levels. Basically, the left hand here is a start here. This is the bare minimum stuff you need to do. As you pick up speed.

[00:15:18.460] - Liz
The stuff in the middle is going to help you take a screenshot of this. Please steal it. Take a screenshot. I want you to remember this, but I don't want you to try to remember all of it at once. Just pick one thing, remember?

[00:15:29.730] - Liz
And then top shelf stuff is something that takes quite a bit of effort. It might take you a year or two to even get there. Right. But basically start here. Just start asking around.

[00:15:41.410] - Liz
You know, hey, I'm starting this thing about meal planning. Do you need help with meal planning? Want to get on my email list? Here we go. Facebook group interactions, of course.

[00:15:51.030] - Liz
And social media. I put an asterisk here. Don't go. Just spamming Facebook groups, et cetera, et cetera. But strategically make yourself available in those Facebook groups.

[00:16:00.410] - Liz
Become the expert on meal planning, on RV, travel on email marketing on whatever. Right? Make yourself the expert and those opportunities to put your freebie and to share what you do are going to come naturally. Guest blogging is a great thing. You can guest blog.

[00:16:17.600] - Liz
You can write about something like if my email or my freebie is a welcome sequence, I might write five guest blogs for people about why welcome sequences are important. And then, of course, the link is to get my welcome sequence for free. Right? I'm not linking to my site. I'm linking directly to the freebie.

[00:16:36.500] - Liz
I want people to sign up. Of course, Pinterest and optimizing your website, which I already showed you. Okay. Picking up speed, you might get a Facebook group. You can ask an entry question. If you have any questions about that, please email me. I want to keep this short.

[00:16:52.460] - Liz
But basically, if you've got that Facebook group, you can ask like, hey, I had a Facebook group that was RV renovations and I asked people like, hey, I've got 101 ideas for renovating your RV. Do you want to put your email below? And so many people would put their email. I think when I sold that blog, I had about 5000 subscribers. And now that blog has over 20,000 subscribers.

[00:17:20.750] - Liz
These things are things that are evergreen, putting yourself and your freebie out there. It lives out there in the internet forever, and you can keep growing. Remember, this is a long term strategy. Link sharing inside your network, I'll show you an example of that in a second. Podcast and summit like this. Right.

[00:17:36.530] - Liz
Giveaways. I do want to say giveaways can give you a lot of leads, but they might not necessarily be good leads. They might be people that are just trying to get the free thing. Once they don't win, they're out. So, I will caveat that, other visibility strategies, like radio, TV, other media guest blogging for Huffington Post, getting interviewed by Amazon.

[00:18:00.580] - Liz
Or I'm sorry, like you know the local news station etcetera, and then grow your affiliates. Right now, I have almost 200 affiliates that literally share my products. And so, what that does is it gets people on my list that are already customers, which is again, that's pretty fun. Right. And then top shelf, like Liz is doing, you can host your own virtual summit or virtual event.

[00:18:25.660] - Liz
You can do JV webinars. Let's say you know my audience makes sense for your meal planning. We're going to get together. We're going to host a webinar and you're going to get those emails that people signed up through me. Right.

[00:18:38.800] - Liz
Other affiliate stuff I just mentioned ,speaking events, and again, this is top shelf, right. You really got to have a message and you have to master it in order to speak. But it's definitely going to get you the best leads ever.

[00:18:52.140] - Liz
If you saw me speaking in real life and you got pumped up when you want to work with me. Yes. And then, of course, just going to events. Just being an attendee that can help you find the right leads as well. Alright, let's go to an example.

[00:19:06.190] - Liz
We're still on this about page. I said I would show you an example of link sharing. Let me get myself out of the way here first. Sorry, folks. I'm going to make myself smaller. Okie, dokie.

[00:19:20.410] - Liz
I think you can still hear me. It says the mic is muted, but then it says the mic is working. So, as you can see here, this is a subject I've taken the day off. Meet Miles. Now Miles is somebody who doesn't do the exact same thing as me, but it makes sense to have him in the ecosystem. So, he's created a special presentation.

[00:19:42.450] - Liz
I'm going to click on it. And if you can't tell from the background, I love in sync. So, what he's done here is how to build a funnel that's in sync with your heart and then you know get on my email list if that makes sense. Now, I did the same thing for Miles. As you can see, his thing is heart funnels.

[00:20:02.240] - Liz
Here's. Liz Wilcox, I made a special gif. Click me. And as you can see here, my call to action is click here to get heart centered email swipes for free, right. So, they click that and then they go directly to this page. Right.

[00:20:19.650] - Liz
And as you can see from what I shared with you earlier, this mega swipe file, I have changed it to say your heart centered, but you also need money. That's where emails come in. Right. So, I just changed it a little bit. It does not take that much effort.

[00:20:36.710] - Liz
Okay. Where am I? Okay. Done with those examples? So basically, what I want you to know is with list building and all of that with the right freebie in the right places you can go from. This is your ideal person saying, like, oh, my gosh, I don't know her right to holy crap, we belong together, right?

[00:21:02.090] - Liz
With the right freebie and the right offer. That is exactly what is going to happen for you. Because list building and visibility go hand in hand. Okay. You can see me in the background here. Hey, list building and visibility go hand in hand.

[00:21:18.450] - Liz
I want you to write that down. List building and visibility go hand in hand. The more you put yourself out there, the more you put your freebie out there, the more you're going to build your list and the more visible you're going to be. Right. So, I want you to, this is job three.

[00:21:36.820] - Liz
And I've mentioned this. It should be job number one, because it's so important. I need to redo this. Recognize that slow growth is still growth, right. I showed you that graphic with my list where it's, like, really, really, slow.

[00:21:51.770] - Liz
Then it's kind of a crazy spike, really, really, slow. Then in the summer, it gets even slower. And then since September, it's just kind of blown up, right. I can't imagine what it's going to look like a year from now, but that's because all of these ideas here are evergreen, right? They are not just ads where it's going to be like, okay, they're running the ads and then the ads get leads.

[00:22:17.270] - Liz
If I turn off the ads, the leads stop coming. All of this stuff, especially podcast summits, other visibility strategies. Those are evergreen, and it's only going to build your list more and more and more and more. Okay. So, remember, slow growth is still growth.

[00:22:33.810] - Liz
Now, here's the one thing I really really want you to learn, and I really want you to take away from this. Write this down Where's my triangle? I will be me and I will have fun. Right. The more authentic you can be. And the more fun.

[00:22:52.490] - Liz
Well, number one, the more authentic you can be, the more you are. I'm very like Wilcox, you can tell that, right. So, the more you can be you, the more it's going to attract the right person. The more you're going to create a freebie that makes sense for you and your audience. And then on the other side, the more you have fun, the more you're going to want to put stuff out there. Right.

[00:23:11.860] - Liz
I love doing presentations like this. Some people don't like to do summit, so don't pick that. If you don't like to do presentations, if you don't like to be on video, pick another visibility. Another list building strategy. Like I said at the beginning, like take what I've given you and just take the one thing that makes sense.

[00:23:28.230] - Liz
Take the one thing that makes the most sense. And you have the most fun with, that's going to make it fun to get out there. That's going to change it from like, oh, no, I have to list that I have to do this. It's a long term strategy. I might not see it for a while, too.

[00:23:40.650] - Liz
Oh, my gosh. This is fun. List building is essential. It's money making, and it's not about getting the highest numbers, about getting that quality. All those things I said at the beginning. If you do this, if you promise yourself, you don't have to promise me.

[00:23:54.320] - Liz
I'd love for you to promise yourself, I will be me and have fun. Then it's going to make all of this, like, truly amazing. It's like I said. Here's the thing, freebies are a dime a dozen. We all know that we've all signed up for a million freebies that we never downloaded.

[00:24:10.780] - Liz
Right? Raise your hand if, right, I feel kind of like a clown. Sometimes every time I sign up for a freebie and don't use it, right? Raise your hand. Just like I said in that last slide.

[00:24:23.030] - Liz
Authenticity being yourself, it attracts and it gains trust. And remember, I said something earlier, people buy from people they trust. So, if you can be authentic, if you can have fun, that's going to gain trust, like, it's going to go zero to 100 real quick. You're going to be like, Drake. Okay.

[00:24:39.130] - Liz
And oh, that's my circle. People buy from people they trust. Now here's my thing. This is a slide full of customers of mine. I know every one of this person.

[00:24:49.970] - Liz
That's a picture of me and Heather with my kid and her kid in San Diego. This is a picture of me and Diana walking to get chips and soda in Philadelphia. Here's a picture of me, RV, and Jessie, and my kid. We met up in Tampa. Of course, I was a travel blogger, so it was very easy for me to meet up with people.

[00:25:07.810] - Liz
I think every one of these pictures is in a different state. But my point is when you list, though, when you create that freebie, when you put yourself and it out there, think of these leads as real people that is going to make it so much easier to do all these things to create the right offer. It's not a chore. It's not just something you have to do to build your list and build your business. This is something that helps you truly connect.

[00:25:37.050] - Liz
And I know as a blogger and I know as being in Liz's world that you are real. You are authentic. And you don't want to just sell stuff, you want to serve people. And so, as you go through, as you pick out what kind of freebie you want to do and where you want to put it, think of all these new leads that you're going to get as real people. And that is going to make email marketing so much more fun. And it's going to help you become so much more authentic because you'll know that you are creating something for the right people.

[00:26:08.540] - Liz
Okay. So, in summary, remember, list building is a long term strategy that pays huge dividends. Write that down if you haven't yet, and you can screenshot this. Hey, screenshot. Number one, all I want you to remember is create a great offer. We talked about that, rewind this you know. Number two, put it everywhere. And right now, I just want you to pick one place and start doing that right.

[00:26:35.010] - Liz
But you've got a dozen plus ideas here. I want you to inject you and every activity. Look at these slides. Look at my background, look at my headband and my rainbow glasses. I am injecting Liz Willcox you know in everything.

[00:26:48.000] - Liz
I embody this because I truly believe it for you and for anyone else that's watching, right. Inject you in every activity that is going to help you. Remember, attract all these right people that are not only going to build your community, but build your business. And above all else, slow growth is still growth. As an Indian Graham three, this was so hard for me to recognize and realize, but the more that I lean into saying slow growth is still growth, the less pressure I feel about myself, and the more I can stay authentic.

[00:27:25.710] - Liz
I don't have to do things I don't want to do because I know doing the right things.

[00:27:29.920] - Liz
It might result in slow growth, but that's still growth. Alright. My name is Liz Wilcox. I would love to have you in my universe. If you want to check out more about my freebie, you can go to Lizwilcox.com in the top right hand corner.

[00:27:44.600] - Liz
As you already know, you can get my free swipes to help you set up a foundation once you get people on those lists. And then, of course, feel free to email me once you're on the list, just hit reply. Email me any questions you've got about the presentation or see me in the Facebook group, anywhere like that. I can't wait to see what you do with email marketing.

**Transcript:**
[00:00:03.650] - Liz Stapleton, Host
All right, guys. I am super excited to have this speaker come back. She is the first princess of email marketing. Liz Wilcox is an email strategist and keynote speaker, showing small businesses how to build online relationships and make real money with emails. She's best known for selling a blog, turning a $9 offer into multiple six figures without ads, and helping you untangle the email knot with her simple framework, this email staircase. She loves the '90s, headbands, and the beach. A big, super warm welcome to Liz Wilcox. Coming back, thank you so much for joining us again.

[00:00:41.940] - Liz Wilcox
Hey, friends. I'm so excited. Let's do this thing.

[00:00:47.170] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Yeah. So we're talking about once you've started growing your audience, what's next, right? So let's dive into how can they, once they start growing that audience, start to nurture a deeper connection with that audience.

[00:01:03.370] - Liz Wilcox
Yeah. So I teach something called the email staircase. First, you've got a follower. We get them on the list. We've got some friends. And then once you have a list full of friends, you can have a list full of customers. So a your friend customer. And really, that's just a fancy way of explaining the customer journey, right? That can feel really, I don't know, like a knot you're never going to be able to untangle. Well, we just untangled it. Three easy steps. So if we want that list full of customers one day, we really have to nurture our subscribers. I say, just make friends in the inbox. And how the heck do you make a friend in the inbox? You just got to do three things. Number one, show that you are invested in your readers. And this can be as simple as if you have a podcast saying, I just bought a new podcast, Mic, so I don't sound like garbage. That shows you're invested in that community, in your readers. It could also be something like, I just attended this event where I'm going to learn all about emails and writing better emails for you.

[00:02:16.650] - Liz Wilcox
It could be, I just recorded this new podcast episode, and I recorded this episode in particular because so and so emailed me asking me this question. Show that you are invested in your readers. No one is going to invest in you if they don't know you're invested in them first, right? The second thing is to just relate to your people. And note, I didn't say, I try to be interesting, right? Let's leave interesting for like, celebrities or something. But it can be really simple to relate to your audience, right? Like, even when Elizabeth was reading my bio, it was like, Oh, she loves the '90s and headbands and the beach. You You probably had those images in your head as she's reading them, right? That's just a very simple way to relate to people. Like, Oh, yeah, I loved the '90s, or boy bands, gross. Headbands, that's weird. Either way, we're relating to our people. And this is really, really important. Why? Because people buy from people they trust, right? So if we can not only show that we are invested in them, but we can become that relatable person. Oh, my gosh, it's going to be over for everyone else.

[00:03:33.470] - Liz Wilcox
And the last thing, and this is what trips people up the most, is just stay top of mind. And no, I don't mean you have to email daily, or if you skip a week, all has been lost. But it is important to stay top of mind because, listen, people don't buy when you sell something. They buy when they're ready, right? So if you're only emailing once a week, every once in a while, If they want a solution on the 15th of the month, but you're not emailing them until the first, they're going to go with whoever's top of mind, right? Think about if and when you buy a house. Who is your realtor? Probably the person you know, or maybe the last person that handed you their card, the first person that popped up on Zillow, right? They're the top of mind person. So I really recommend staying top of mind, writing emails at least once a week. But guess what? These emails don't have to be hard. And when you do these first two things, when you show you're invested, when you become relatable, staying top of mind becomes a lot easier.

[00:04:46.850] - Liz Stapleton, Host
I like that. So when you're trying to stay top of mind, right, as your audience grows, I feel like it can be difficult to make it still feel personal and relevant, right? So what are some tips you have to make sure that what you're writing, even when it's going out to thousands of people, still feels really personal?

[00:05:09.830] - Liz Wilcox
Yeah. So when it comes to making the emails personal, Again, think about what is relatable for the majority of your people, right? For me, I tend to use the '90s, right? That's relatable for most people, even if you're a Gen-X or a boomer. You were there, right? You remember that stuff. And then also just the idiosyncrasies of life make it personal. For example, a lot of email marketers will tell you, Oh, just tell stories. Well, that's hard. But instead of telling a story, just do a personal update, 2-3 sentences, like something you've done since the last time you e-mailed someone, right? And so this can be, Oh, I took the dog for a walk. My kids are on half days, and I'm rushing to get work done before they get home. What's more relatable than something like that, right? My fridge just broke. I'm going to... I'm writing you really quick before the repair man gets here. Those little things, those little life moments, those everyday things are incredibly relatable. And it's not about making everything customizable and segmenting your list like crazy. It's more about pulling out those things in life that everyone has a personal connection to.

[00:06:43.600] - Liz Stapleton, Host
I like that you said that and it's not all focused on the tech side of things, because one of my other questions is going to be, how do you grow, keep things simple but effective? Because I know I was totally guilty of it. I had so many opt-ins and then so many different welcome sequences that then led to this and led to that. And it's like a hot mess it feels like at this point. I'm just trying. I've been at this for 10 years. I'm just trying to simplify. So how can people avoid the mistake I made, I guess, and keep a bit simple and keep growing? Because sometimes you feel like you need to create another freebie or opt-in or whatever to keep things moving. Yeah.

[00:07:24.500] - Liz Wilcox
Chances are you don't need another opt-in. Let's just clear the air on that. You probably just, you need to promote your current opt-in more. You need to find more people for that. Visibility is really, really important, right? So instead of thinking, Oh, I got to create something new. This isn't working. It's like, Okay, well, what are you doing to make this work in the first place? And can you repeat the main question? Because I want to make sure that I get it right. I just wanted to talk about that real quick.

[00:07:55.210] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Yeah, no. As they grow, how can they keep their approach simple but still effective?

[00:08:00.670] - Liz Wilcox
Oh, yeah. Number one thing with anything in business, intentionality, right? What is your intention? Think about the vision that you have for your subscribers. For example, my vision is you make money with email marketing. I don't care about anything else. I don't care about your podcast mic, how your screen looks, your webinars, what tools you're using. All I care is that you make money with email marketing. So when it comes to what I'm putting in the newsletters, how I'm getting people on my list, I just always keep that in mind. Is this going to help people make money with email marketing? That's my vision for you. And when it comes to emails, honestly, let this be, I don't know, a permission slip. You want it to be simple. No one wants to read long, convoluted, gigantic newsletters, right? Unless they're super duper fans. And the majority of your list, they're probably just interested. They're not super duper fans yet, right? Yeah, right. And so we just want to get in the inbox. We want to get to the point, and we want to get out. So instead of thinking, Oh, I've got to have this for them.

[00:09:09.530] - Liz Wilcox
I have to create value over here. I have to create another freebie over here. Just think, What is the simplest way I can help them with that vision today? And it might be, Oh, I recorded this podcast episode. It's 20 minutes long. You should listen to it because A, B, C reasons. Okay, enjoy. Bye. We don't need to set up a story and move it into whatever. Just being as quick, honest, and, I don't know, transparent as you can be in those emails is a great way to keep it simple. And the last thing I'll say is, and I say this with love, love yourself a little bit more, my friend. Getting things complicated is an act of disservice for yourself. Letting yourself keep things simple is really, number one, it's going to help you love yourself more. I know that's woo-woo, but it's going to help you keep going. Email is already hard, so we don't need to add on all these layers. When in doubt, how can you subtract from your strategy to just get in there, connect with your audience, and get them moving?

[00:10:24.470] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Yeah, I like that. So speaking of connecting and getting them moving, what are some maybe creative, low stress ways for you to keep your email subscribers engaged, but at the same time, not overwhelm them? I know you're a really good example.

[00:10:38.470] - Liz Wilcox
Okay. So my number one way to get people to engage without overwhelming them and myself is to get very simple replies. Okay. Email might feel like, oh, it's about closing the sale, but really it's about opening up relationships. And the easiest way to do this is to just ask simple yes or no These are low effort for you and your reader, right? So for example, one of my questions is, do you have a weekly newsletter? Hit reply, yes or no. They might say, no, but I want to, yes, I love it, or Yes, I love it. Or yes, but I usually feel like crap after I hit send. And then that allows me to open up the conversation. Maybe I've got a podcast episode that helps them. Oh, you know what? You said this about it being so stressful. Here's my podcast episode. Here's my blog post. Or just typing a few bits of encouragement, right? Or putting, Oh, you need my membership then? Click here, right? It's about opening up that relationship. And it's a real low effort. You don't have to, with a yes or no question, you don't have to come in with a novel, right?

[00:11:51.590] - Liz Wilcox
You can just give them a few quick tips or some encouragement, or point them to your Facebook group, or point them to even some outward content that maybe you didn't even create that could help them, or point them to your consultation or whatever. You don't have to give them everything in that reply. That's a really low lift way to keep people engaged. Another way is to talk about things that aren't even related to your industry, but are absolutely relatable, right? I'll give you a real good, if you have no idea what to write in your next newsletter, write this one. It's It's called Beach or Mountains. That's the subject line. And you can say, Hey, Liz, I don't know why, but I'm really interested in knowing. I know this has nothing to do with XYZ, whatever we normally talk about. But do you like the beach or mountains? And getting people to click like that? Because that's something, Oh, I'm a beach girly for sure. Oh, no, I love the mountains. And just getting them to click, again, it's this low effort thing. It's this low responsibility for the reader because it's not like, Oh, what is she trying to get out of this?

[00:13:05.890] - Liz Wilcox
If I click this, is it going to go to a funnel or whatever? It's just so out of the box, but it gets people involved. Also, some people might hit reply, Oh my gosh, I love the beach. Here's a picture of me. Again, it's about opening up those conversations. I recommend doing stuff like this every now and again to the questions point of, How do we get people engaged? But When we can get them to click on something like that, the next time when we say, Hey, are you interested in a product on X or Z? They're already used to clicking on that, and so they're more likely to click later.

[00:13:44.860] - Liz Stapleton, Host
I like that. I'm curious because you said you don't need to give them all the answers. You can refer to things if someone's asking a question. Do you ever... Because first of all, if anyone ever gets a negative email, just know that means you've made it. I think that's in my opinion. Amen. If someone emails you, and it's full on. I literally... That's how I knew I made it. I don't remember when, but someone literally joined my email list just so they could get my email and email me a 800-word diatribe. And I was like, Made it.

[00:14:20.360] - Liz Wilcox
Made it, baby.

[00:14:21.340] - Liz Stapleton, Host
But sometimes it's not that direct. Sometimes it just seems like they're asking a question, they want to catch you out in something, but they just seem to be coming from a native space. Do you even entertain responding to those? Do you just say, I'm letting this one go?

[00:14:34.560] - Liz Wilcox
Such a good question. I honestly, I don't mind trolls, so to speak. I actually, personally, I love customer service, and I have found that I can turn people around. But that is a skill, okay? And it doesn't affect me here, right? And so if you don't feel like you have that skill, or it just feels like a lot, don't entertain it. Just delete. Or if you're an archive person, archive it, because it's not worth it. Your energy is better spent doing the next thing that's going to grow your business, right? And so making sure you protect that energy and just delete, unless it's a customer who's really ticked off and actually needs a response, right? Needs asking for a refund, even though they're not being tactful about it. But if it's just someone, like Liz said, that's just there to spew hatred, peace out. You can definitely just delete. But I will say there are some times where I do get haters, and it's so much for me that I can't help but respond and just say my piece. I always say, I never defend myself, but I reserve the right to clarify, right? And so if someone's coming at me, Oh, this is garbage, whatever, whatever, I don't have to defend myself.

[00:16:12.150] - Liz Wilcox
Oh, that's not true. I do, but I can clarify my intentions if and when I feel that's appropriate.

[00:16:21.640] - Liz Stapleton, Host
No, I like that. And I will say for people, you can unsubscribe people, too.

[00:16:26.990] - Liz Wilcox
Oh, my. Preach on the Preach on the pulpit, baby. Yes, listen, you all, and this happens in my Facebook a lot. Oh, I got this hate. It's like you can block them. You can delete them from your list. You can unsubscribe them. There's been a few people, and in my business that have purchased something, asked for a refund, been less than kind, purchased something again, the same thing. And you can actually even block people from purchasing your products.

[00:16:57.870] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Yup, I've definitely done that. Or They bought it, and then they filed a complaint with the company, which I still won. Because I could prove, Oh, well, it must have been my husband bought it, and I didn't realize. I'm like, Okay. No, me.

[00:17:13.960] - Liz Wilcox
That's a little Yeah, that's a little side note. But yes, if you're feeling some type of way, just unsubscribe it. You don't even have to reply.

[00:17:24.480] - Liz Stapleton, Host
You don't need to justify.

[00:17:26.190] - Liz Wilcox
Exactly. It's very important, especially in those first few years of starting your blog or business, you've got to protect your energy because it takes a lot to get something off the ground or to get it moving the way you want it to move. And so, yeah, it's all about follow or friend customer. If you're never going to be friends with that person, you're out of here.

[00:17:49.270] - Liz Stapleton, Host
I like that way to bring it back to that initial thing. Okay, so we've talked about, again, follow from customer and you don't have to shove your stuff down their throats. You just need to stay top of mind. So that's the right way to go about things. And I think we've touched on some mistakes as well. But let's dig into a little bit more of common mistakes you see when people are trying to monetize their list because everyone's like, Oh, the money is in the list. And a lot of times when you're starting out, you're just like, I feel like all I'm doing is paying for my list, and I'm not getting a return. So what are some mistakes people make when trying to monetize, and how can they avoid them?

[00:18:24.670] - Liz Wilcox
I think the biggest mistake I see, this is such a good question, is people trying to monetize a product that they haven't gotten feedback on. So, Oh, I just have this idea. I'm going to create it, and then I'm going to sell it. You got to get feedback, especially when you're first starting to monetize, and you do have, even if you've just got 50 people on your list, getting them involved in the creation of the product is going to help you succeed so much faster. It's going to help you see your blind spots. It's going to help you make the product better. And remember, we talked about investing, right? Investing in your audience. This is going to show you're invested so that people invest in the product and the success of it before you even ask them for a dollar. When I was creating my first digital product, I was an RV travel blogger, and I had no idea what product to create, but I knew I needed to monetize that list. What's the point? And I asked people, Why do you follow me? I don't I don't even really know what I'm doing. Sometimes I talk about this, sometimes I talk about that.

[00:19:34.720] - Liz Wilcox
I said, Well, Liz, you're really funny. You can tell a good story. So I created a book of funny stories around RV Travel. And guess what? It sold. And I also didn't create it until I got my first sale. I said, Okay, I've got this idea now that you told me I'm a funny storyteller. Now, here's a PayPal link. It's going to be $20 bucks, but you can buy it for $10. And I got, I think, one or two sales. And that's when I knew, okay, I'm going to create the book. Because at the time, I was brand new. Oh, my gosh, I just made $20 off something that doesn't exist yet? Holy crap. This is amazing. So I think the biggest mistake I see is creating in a silo. Oh, I've been talking, I've been opening. I'm doing the things, listen, I'm getting replies, but not telling anyone about the product. So as you create it, sharing in your emails. Hey, I picked the platform. I'm going to go with WordPress. I'm on Kajabi. Even if you're like, Oh, my gosh, I'm a crochet blogger. They don't give a crap. Yes, they do. They want to see the process.

[00:20:44.330] - Liz Wilcox
They signed up for your list, not only for your tips, but like emphasis on your, right? They like you. There's something about you that they like. And they will like, I promise, they will like seeing the behind the scenes stuff. So That's the biggest mistake I see.

[00:21:02.410] - Liz Stapleton, Host
I like that. Okay, so we need to wrap up. I think that was a fantastic tip. I know you have tons of stuff that you can share with them. You've got a new podcast. It's amazing if people haven't given it a listen, definitely go check that out. But where do you want people to find you? What should they do? What link is going to be on this page?

[00:21:21.510] - Liz Wilcox
Oh, yeah, of course. I'm an email marketer. I want you to join my email list, baby. You can go directly to lizwilcox.com. Hit the hot pink button, you're going to get three things. Number one, you're going to get an entire welcome sequence already written for you. So as you grow your list, as you find those followers, you're going to know exactly how to welcome them, sharing that vision with them, sharing the expectations, and helping you monetize from day one with that welcome sequence. You're also going to get three newsletter samples, one to show you how to click, one to show you how to get people to buy, and a third, how to get people to reply, which we talked a lot about today. And if that's not enough, you're also going to get 52 subject lines for a year full of prompts. All that, lizwilcox.com, hot pink button, or I'm sure there's some beautiful button somewhere. It'll be on the screen. Let me just point in all directions. I'm sure you'll find it. I'd love to help you with your email marketing. It really is the way that I've changed my life. I'm sure Liz can attest to it.

[00:22:26.160] - Liz Wilcox
It's awesome.

[00:22:27.050] - Liz Stapleton, Host
All right. And I know you have something for those that upgrade their past as well. Can you tell us about that?

[00:22:32.530] - Liz Wilcox
Yeah. So if you upgrade, remember we talked about the biggest mistake you can make with monetizing your list is to not tell anyone to create in a silo. I actually have some pre-sell templates. It's called Just If you sell it normally $49, you're going to get it for free. And those are templates to get people to buy. I got people to buy my book before you even create the product. Super excited for you to have them. So upgrade now.

[00:22:58.830] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Yeah, definitely check that out, you guys. Liz Wilcox is always fantastic to learn from. I always learn something new when I talk to her. Liz, thank you so much. I really appreciate you teaching.

[00:23:09.140] - Liz Wilcox
Yeah. Thank you for having me.

**Transcript:**
[00:00:09.480] - Liz Stapleton, Summit Host
I'm super excited for today's session with Meera Kotland, who is a best selling author, that's, I think, how I came across her and I see her books. Amazon is always suggesting more of her books to me. Meera welcome and thank you for doing this.

[00:00:22.620] - Meera Kotland, meerakothand.com
Thank you so much for having me. Really excited to be here today.

[00:00:26.010] - Liz
Yeah. So, if you want to give people a little more about your background, just so they kind of have an idea where you're coming from and dive into our topic today.

[00:00:34.140] - Meera
Sure. So the usual little story I always share with people is that I never wanted to be an entrepreneur. So I came into this like four years ago. I was in corporate my you know, my whole background is about everything told while I was raised is going to get a job, stuff like that. So, I kind of fell into this by accident. And everything I did was pretty much just finding my way through it, a set of things that I did clicked and I started blogging and then growing my audience and then creating products and books and stuff like that.

[00:01:15.300] - Meera
So the main thing that enchants my audience is about creating digital products and about how to use e-mail marketing to sell right. And selling doesn't have to be sleezy. So this is in a nutshell, kind of what I share with my audience and how I kind of came into the online space pretty much by accident. I'm not really the kid who want to, you know, who was selling lemonade or anything of that sort. So, yeah.

[00:01:41.940] - Liz
Yeah, because I think because I think people are like ""Oh you need your email list."" ""You need you email list."" You need your email list."" And you go like ""I'm paying a lot of money for my email list. When does it start paying for itself. Right. So, I know today we're going to be talking about brand name or building brand building nurture sequences. So what is the nurture sequence and why is it important?

[00:02:03.880] - Meera
Yeah, and then on the observation about the email lit option, and I know it can be kind of a very tricky situation in the early days because you're not making money, but people tell you you need an email to make money, so you need to be paying for that. So what happens when it's kind of hard in the early days. I agree with that. But if I can give one concrete tip, it's not to go with an email service provider just because they're free. Because you have to be in it for the long game. So choose a provider that is yes obviously within your budget, but be with someone who you feel you could grow with, who would be able to kind of grow with your business. So look at the fields that they have, stuff like that.

[00:02:51.850] - Liz
[inaudible]

[00:02:52.210] - Meera
Sorry?

[00:02:51.850] - Liz
I was just gonna say switching email providers is a nightmare- switching hosts is super easy. Switching email marketing service.

[00:03:03.990] - Meera
Nightmare.

[00:03:04.060] - Liz
Horrendous.

[00:03:07.160] - Meera
Yeah, exactly. So that is a lot of the a lot of comments that I get from subscribers saying that it's a nice kind of switching between so you don't want to happen to you, especially when you're in the middle of a launch or you're launching your first product and stuff like that.

[00:02:52.210] - Meera
So pick a tool provider who has features and stuff like that that you think you're going to use will serve your audience as well. So that's just kind of like a quick tip. So as a service provider, even though you're not making any money, even though you have nothing for sale, you need to have an email list. And a lot of people who tell me that, ""You know, I think I will do this after I have done some things, after I have maybe 20 posts on my site, or maybe I released or launched 20 videos."" It doesn't work that way because, all right, you have all this content and maybe people have come to find that those pieces of content. But you're not doing anything to capture those people onto your email list if you don't have one in the first place. So you absolutely need to have one. And you can't just have one as like a placeholder. You need to do a couple of things. And that is one of the first things you should do is to have that note in sequence.

[00:04:17.500] - Meera
So it's kind of like rolling out the red carpet for a new subscriber. You are kind of paving the way for them to discover your brand yourself because the last thing you want to do someone to get on your email list and then they don't get anything. They don't hear from you. And the next time they hear you is maybe three months later or six months later when you're ready to launch your first product and they probably lost, you're going to get lots of unsubscribes. You're not going- you haven't done anything to build up that trust or authority with that audience in order for them to even buy from you in the first place. So, yeah, that's where a natural sequence comes into play. And I think we'll be telling more about what they can put into nurture sequence and stuff like that. But, yeah, just just kind of an introduction about what a nurture sequence is. Basically a couple of emails that just goes out to anyone that subscribes.

[00:05:10.840] - Meera
So, you can have someone subscribing today. You can have someone subscribing three months later, but they get the same notice.

[00:05:16.920] - Liz
Yeah, because I think some of us forget that we may not have been a long time fan of our blogs before they sign up. It may have been afraid to cut their eye. And so they don't know you so nurture sequence is great to introduce yourself to them and what you do. So what should besides whatever incentive you've got to get them on the email list, what what should you be sending them once they're on their lists, the nurture sequence? What should that look like? Right.

[00:05:42.580] - Meera
So, usually I kind of go by like a minimum, a minimum viable nurture sequence, because when people think of nurture sequences, they think that has to be like a month long or sixty days long. And when you think of something of that magnitude, usually you never get it done. So what do you have to do is think what is the least number of emails I can get out there and I always suggest three to five. Okay. But if you can push yourself a little bit more, I would say go ahead and do five to seven, because this would give everyone kind of like a nice introduction to everything that you do.

[00:06:19.420] - Meera
So, the exact kind of emails that you should put in there, it doesn't have to be content that is absolutely from scratch. You can write teases to existing blog post that you have or you can write teasers to existing videos that you have. The kind of things that I like to share in my emails are a lot about awareness building because regardless of the needs that you're in, we all whether you're in the fitness niche or the parenting niche, or whether the productivity niche, you know, it really doesn't matter. But we are all there to solve some kind of a problem for our audience and to provide solutions. And they all have different kinds of pain points.

[00:06:58.240] - Meera
So when I say pain points, people immediately think, ""But I really have a pain point."" The thing is, a pain point doesn't just mean not having money or it doesn't just mean I don't know how to start a business. There are different kinds of pain points. It could be I don't know how to organize my kid's closet or I don't know how to homeschool or I don't know how to do meal planning. There are so many different types of pain points. And for me, the initial part of a nurture sequence is about bringing awareness to the pain point, because a lot of people that join your they are not necessarily going to be aware of the magnitude of the pain point, or they might not be aware that there are solutions out there for the problems that they're facing, regardless of the niche that you're in. So, when you have this kind of content within your nurture sequence something that that shares maybe stories about people you've helped, clients you've helped, or telling them about certain mistakes that they may be making that they're not even aware. So, when you do it like this, you are setting yourself up to be seen as an expert or someone they can trust.

[00:08:10.880] - Meera
So, I usually like to do this within the first one to three emails. So you always have- you have to welcome email. And then I like to talk about mistakes people make or things that they believe that are not necessarily true. We all believe in myths and things that we may have heard and we think are true, but they might be hindering our progress or they might be kind of hindering and interfering with the way that we work or do certain things. So, when you bring this to light, that is where people are going to reply back to you. They're going to engage with you and you when they see your name in their inbox this is where they are going to move into clicking your email. So you're nurture sequence kind of sets the pot and paves the way for that.

[00:08:59.630] - Liz
Yeah, because one thing I've learned in the last year is, it's not so much your email subject line that gets people talking. It's your name.

[00:09:05.720] - Meera
Yeah, exactly. And a lot of people ask me, ""What subject lines work the best?"" And I say, ""You know, it's not really a subject line. Its more your name, especially for if you are not really doing like e-commerce kind, but it's all about discounts and products and stuff like that. When you're building a personal brand or you're a coach or you're a content creator of the kind, it's really about your name. And once your name is associated with value, once your name is associated with any kind of emotion, it doesn't just have to be about, ""Hey, this girl or this lady provides good information."" It could even be about she's funny or she's inspirational or she makes me feel good in the morning. You know, it could be any of that wants to have that association people are going to be opening your emails regardless of the subject line.

[00:09:53.600] - Liz
Yeah, because, I mean, when you think about it, I mean, there are certain emails because I'm on a lot of newsletters. I've been blogging for years. Like I'm on a ton of newsletters and there are certain ones that I automatically open as soon as they come to my inbox. And others are like, ""Uh, maybe I'll read that later.""

[00:10:07.400] - Meera
Exactly.

[00:10:07.880] - Liz
Like, it really does make a difference. Okay, so how do you- one thing I want to ask you is you're kind of making them aware of a pain point. How do you do that without being like a Debbie Downer? Right. No one likes the negative Nancy, who's like, ""This is her problem, huh? This is it."" There's solutions out there all eventually tell you what they are like. But how do you kind of approach that? Yeah.

[00:09:53.600] - Meera
So when you are talking about pain points, you- I get what you mean- you shouldn't really just be throwing out, ""Hey, this is wrong. This is wrong."" You shouldn't be doing this, but where possible you should be kind of weaving in solutions as well. And for me, when I  send an email like this, I, I usually would encourage them to reply back to me. And I do take the time to just kind send them a quick reply. Or even if you can say, you know, ""If you do feel like you're making all of these mistakes, don't worry, hang in there, because the next few emails, I'm going to cover this. So you could be kind of, you know, you could kind of be saying like, all right, these are the mistakes. I hear you. You're worried, but I got your back in the next couple of emails. In this nurture sequence, I will be sending you pieces of content that can help you kind of rectify these mistakes.""

[00:11:23.150] - Meera
So, we are building awareness and then you can kind of bring in your solutions. So, this is where you can actually link to pieces of content on your blog or your video, because- or your YouTube channel or Podcast where maybe you have discussed how to kind of content. So, those are perfect because they are kind of like the early part of the- your solutions are obviously your office products that could be coaching, could be a service you provide. But we all if we are doing content marketing right, we would have pieces of content that talk about that, how to be that up pillar post or pillar videos. So, these are the ones that you can link to in your nurture sequence that would kind of balance out this, like you mentioned, this fear of this worry that your initial emails have kind of given them. But for me, you know, it really depends on the tone that you use, the way you're putting it across. It shouldn't really be about striking them down or kind of schooling them and everything they've been doing wrong. But it's to really just, ""Hey, did you notice or did you know that this is not necessarily true because blah-blah-blah"". Or sharing a story and then weaving in the point. So, when you do it in that way, it doesn't have to be- it doesn't have to come across harsh or it doesn't have to be. You don't have to come across because we like-

[00:12:47.270] - Liz
I've been there, you know.

[00:12:48.900] - Meera
Yeah. Exactly.

[00:12:50.070] - Liz
[Inaudible] I've done it. Or some clients have been there and there's nothing like them, you know, and it's okay like you can just doing what you like.

[00:12:57.800] - Meera
You don't want to come in high and mighty and say you hate blah, blah, blah, you've done this. That's not what you want to sound like.

[00:13:04.940] - Liz
Yeah. Okay, so we've said, you know, three to five emails, ideally five to seven and you do the first one and you kind of then we points of your content and stuff. But is there a specific order that you need to be hitting things or weaving in content, or do you need to be giving them other freebies? What's...?

[00:13:25.520] - Meera
Right. Okay. So, I- this is really based on what you're comfortable with. I like to do the first three emails back to back. And the reason is because studies have shown that the first 48 hours or so- 46 to 36 hours is when people are the most engaged with your brand. I mean, it makes sense because they would have found a piece of content or found your lead magnet, signed up. So, that is when your name is really fresh in their minds. So, when you send them emails within those few do those two days or three days, they are going to be- they're going to remember you. And your name is kind of you're going to be building layers of trust in that sense compared toll all right, get a welcome email one whole week and then another email. So, you don't really get to cement or build on that initially of trust. And so that it's kind of like my rationale for doing it this way. I do the first three back to back after that, I going to space it out. I do it maybe one every two days and then three days. I space it out after that because I've done the initial work of kind of yeah getting my name across. But when I mentioned this to people, some of them are like, ""I don't think it works for my audience because they are moms. I don't think they are comfortable with getting this kind of a frequency. Well, this is something you need to test out. So if you're going to- if you have that kind of an audience, maybe people who are busy, who don't really want to check their emails, I think that's fine. You could try this like what I said, do the first three back to back. And if you feel that a lot of people are kind of unsubscribing within those few emails or you're losing a lot of people, then go easy on the other frequency.

[00:15:12.350] - Liz
Cut it out, but don't go automatically every week because a lot can happen in a week. Have you looked at Twitter?

[00:15:17.570] - Meera
Yeah, exactly. I know, right? Yeah. So, for me, the first three emails I always get very healthy opens because they're kind of looking out for my name and the inbox and because of the nature of those emails is awareness building is letting talking to them about mistakes kind of building that. Yeah. Kind of letting them know that these are the things they need to correct. Because of that, the opens and the clicks are going to be very healthy, especially the initial emails. So.

[00:15:50.790] - Meera
So, yeah, this is kind of the frequency that I suggest now when it comes to giving out freebies in your natural sequence to answer that. I was I had the my initial thought process with this whole thing is that you need to be giving away lots and lots of freebies. I need to give them something free. If not, they are going to feel like they're not getting enough value. That was my line of thought when I first started out. And I was so wrong because it can actually do a lot more damage then than good, because when you get your audience used to just getting freebies, whether they use it or not, it's going to come back and bite you.

[00:16:29.480] - Liz
[inaudible].

[00:16:32.930] - Meera
Yeah, yeah, that's one thing. And you're also just building a list of passive consumers. I mean, you don't really know they're taking action. For all they know, they're going to be downloading this and then keeping it in their files. And people just kind of feel safe that information is there regardless of whether they use it or not. So, I would rather create content that gets them to think than feed them with information that I don't know if they're going to use or not.

[00:16:58.690] - Meera
So, apart from the initial lead magnet that you are going to be giving them it's not really necessary that you have to continuously be giving them some kind of some kind of a freebie. If it's like content on your site. That's something that you always are going to be creating, right whether it's for a blog or a YouTube channel. But apart from that, like new pieces just for your subscribers, I don't think it's necessary at all.

[00:17:23.300] - Liz
Okay. No, I do like that. So, a couple of follow questions on that. What would you consider to be a good open return after six months?

[00:17:35.620] - Meera
Okay. I don't- I can't remember the actual stats, but the welcome email obviously has one of the highest open rates. You could see open rates like 60% easily on your welcome email. So for me, it's about their 60 plus and then over- any nurture sequence your open rates would kind of fall as people progress on. But the initial emails, you can aim for open rates of like 50% or 40%. The smaller list is very likely you would get a lot a much bigger open rate but in general, if you're asking like industry wide, I think if you are going to get anything above 20% it's considered kind of good. For personal brands I would say if you starting out if you are going to get 30% and above, it's pretty good. But yeah, the first few e-mails in a nurture sequence always aimed for 50% above and it's not difficult to hit at all. And the other thing is, don't just be lulled into, all right, open rate is good. But if you have a call to action in there, if you're asking people to click on something, have a look at your click through rates as well. See if people are clicking on those links. Because if they are not clicking on those links, then it means that you haven't really set up the link in that sense. You haven't really built that email up such that people want to click on that link. So, it could be that they don't really see the need to click on that link or maybe you've just given everything away such that people don't really want to click on that anymore. So, a few different situations over here.

[00:19:22.680] - Liz
Okay. So, another question I have is you talked about them really looking for emails the first few days, of course, the welcome one they're going to look for- they just signed up. [inaudible] How do you keep them looking out for your name? Is it typically just like a teaser of I'll be back tomorrow with X. Or is it more than that?

[00:19:42.630] - Meera
Yeah. So, I usually like to use the P as the post postscript. That is, I would say really precious email real estate. I mean, I don't know. Sometimes I think it's kind of like- it's like an unconscious thing. We would just scroll down and look at the very bottom because we don't really have the time. So, whenever there's something important that you want people to take, it's good to repeat that in the piece.

[00:20:10.650] - Meera
So for me, in nurture sequences, what I do is because the first three I send it back to back or the first couple of emails, it's going to be pretty in terms of frequency is going to be going out quite fast. I would tell them, ""By the way, tomorrow I'm going to be sharing"", and then I would give them like maybe it's it could be a frequently asked questions that everyone has in my niche, or it could be the one thing that clients always do, but then they shouldn't. Something like that. Something that kind of teases them. It gets them- it intrigues them to want to know what the answer to this is. And I have had so many responses when I put something like this and they say, ""Really looking forward to tomorrow's email"" or ""I'm so happy I signed up, I really want to know the answer to this. I'm looking forward to tomorrow."" So, this is how you kind of set it up. And the only way you can do this is in a sequence because you know what exactly comes next? What comes next? What comes next?

[00:21:08.080] - Liz
You have to be really on top and super organized on a  regular.

[00:21:10.090] - Meera
Exactly. Yeah. Yeah, SEO. And you can build up the intrigue and all of that to get them to look out for the next email. So it's it's not automatic. You need to put in the work to do it in the email.

[00:21:26.070] - Liz
Okay, so would you pretty much always recommend having your call to action, whatever it is in your PS, is there a time where you have something else on that PS?

[00:21:33.780] - Meera
So I like to do multiple PS's, but I would like just to tease my audience a little bit.

[00:21:44.730] - Liz
I've done a few.

[00:21:44.730] - Meera
Yeah. So I would have like a call to action there. But but sometimes I would kind of add like like a funny comment in the PPS. So, yeah, I mean, there's no hard and fast rule is it's really kind of figuring out your style and going from that. But the main thing is if this unless you're doing newsletter style. What I call a newsletter is where you've got multiple links and you're talking about a few different things. The kind of emails that I suggest you put in your nurture sequence are single goal emails.

[00:22:21.310] - Meera
Each email has one call to action or at most two call to actions. And they have a very specific message or very specific goal for each email. So, those are different from a newsletter where it is like an update. It's got a few different things and stuff like that. So, yes PS always repeat your call to action that you've included at the very beginning. I have seen, like I mentioned, I like to do like a quirky comment sometimes or sometimes. I would also say, by the way, hit reply and tell me just like an answer to one question or something like that. So a call to action you could do. You could also do like a reply back to me. Let me know what you thought, stuff like that. So yeah, use your PS to the max. But it's best not to have multiple calls to action because then your audience doesn't really-

[00:23:13.950] - Liz
You're making them think.

[00:23:15.040] - Meera
Action on any. Yeah. Exactly. You don't want them to think too much.

[00:23:17.710] - Liz
Yeah. You want to make it easy for them to make a decision.

[00:23:20.770] - Meera
Correct.

[00:23:21.850] - Liz
Okay, so what would you say is the biggest mistake people are making with their nurture sequences?

[00:23:28.760] - Meera
I would. Okay, the first thing is not having enough a nurture sequence. Yeah, but the I think most people, if they they had this in place, then if they have a nurture sequence in place, they are actually having- they are putting in some effort into it. So, that's a good thing. But I think the misconception that I feel I've seen a lot of people make of subscribers and clients I've worked with is that they think that it's all about just sharing content and they feel that they cannot be selling anything via a nurture sequence.

[00:24:05.840] - Meera
So, yeah, so they feel that nurture sequence is a nurture sequence. If I want to pitch them something, it should be something that's completely separate. But I like to weed both both of them in together. So I, completely don't agree with the fact that a nurture sequence is just purely about nurture. I think there is a place for you to sell and build your brand and build trust at the same time, and it can be done very seamlessly. So, if you do have something for sale or you do want them to take some specific action, you can actually include that in your nurture sequence. But of course, do your due diligence. You don't want to be selling that in the first email or the second email. You don't want to be doing that. You want to make sure you've done enough to get them ready to say yes to that offer. So, if you've done that, then regardless, even if it's in the sequence, you can go ahead and sell.

[00:24:59.870] - Liz
Okay, gotcha. And does it always have to be selling one of your products or could you sell an affiliate link? Do you do that in a nurture sequence at all, like tools or something or...?

[00:25:10.940] - Meera
Absolutely, so you yeah, I do that as well. So, if the main thing is the tools or the products or offers that you are going to be sharing has to be linked to the topic that they just opted in for. So there's going to be a right now that they opted in for, that is going to be part of one category, a bucket of content.

[00:25:32.570] - Meera
And the nurture sequence has to be related to that as well. So whatever tools and products, even if it's not yours that you're sharing, has to be linked to that. So, as long as it's relevant, you're good. The only place where people would be like kind of raising eyebrows is that what- what does this- what does this have to do with? Why am I getting this? I didn't even sign up for this. So, you don't want that even that little bit of that mistrust or that that raised eyebrows kind of feeling, you know, what am I getting? You don't want that. So as long as it's linked, you're fine. You don't even need to have your own product. You could share affiliate products and offers. And I do that as well.

[00:26:10.320] - Liz
Okay. So, how hard do you push a product during a nurture sequence? Right. Because it's one thing to kind of an email for casually mention like, oh, this could be a solution. It's another to follow and have the email focused on what you're selling. Where do you draw the line on that and how do you make that bit?

[00:26:10.320] - Meera
Yeah. So for me, I, I like to mention the offer early, very early in any sequence that I have. So, usually like just like how you say it's a casual mention and I do this for like at least two or three emails, just a casual mention, so that it kind of sees the idea of that offer. It gets them familiar with the name of the author so that when I'm going to be when the whole email, the entire email is going to be talking about the benefits of that offer, they're not going to be kind of taken aback because I've done that little bit of build up and I've mentioned this along the way. So, it's not like in your face kind of thing all of a sudden. And I say, ""Hey, go buy this."" You don't want to do that. Which is why I always recommend mentioning it early compared to mentioning only when at the very end of the sequence. So, there are some that I mentioned as early as the third email and obviously it's not like a hard pitch kind of email is just like a casual mention.

[00:27:32.150] - Meera
By the way, this is something that I talk about in this course. That's about it. That's all. No link. Nothing at all just to name. And then in the next one I could say this is exactly what student in this course experienced  as well. No link. Nothing else. Just the name. So, you're kind of building up the anticipation that people are going to be, ""Okay. Maybe I could check this out. I'm looking for this. She has this course, so let me see what else she has. When does she open?"" You might get some replies? Are you going to open this soon as the surprise and stuff like that? So, at the end, when you're ready to finally start to mention what exactly your offer is about, the actual sales page and stuff like that, people are not going to be taken aback because you didn't fling this at them out of nowhere. This is like, you know, within their email inbox from the very- from the very beginning. Yeah.

[00:28:25.130] - Liz
Okay. No, I like that. I'm like, ""Oh, I need to adjust some of my nutures. Okay, so any sort of final words or advice for people just starting out with the nurture sequence, who or who like me have them or tweak a few things. Any, any final words of advice?

[00:28:45.510] - Meera
I think the only one thing I would say is, there's no way you can get it to be perfect. I think that's a lot of- that's something a lot of people struggle with because they never get it out, because they want it to be perfect. They want to get everything right. And it just doesn't happen that way. Like, my- the nurture sequence I have right now is completely different from what I had when I started out. And things evolve. Things change. Your messaging changes and you will discover how to write better, how to- the tone of your emails will change as well. So, as long as you're comfortable with it, I would say just publish it. Let it go live.

[00:29:24.960] - Liz
Done is better than perfect.

[00:29:26.520] - Meera
Yeah, exactly. Rather than just stick to it. And you wouldn't believe it, but there are people who've been kind of communicating with me for years and they're going to do this, they're going to launch this and they haven't. And it's easily like two to three years. And sometimes I feel sad, but they just stop because they just can't let go and just get it out there and see how the responses, see how the engagement is. Because the only way you can tweak is once you have people actively going through that sequence, you wouldn't be able to do anything before that.

[00:29:59.100] - Meera
But people spend so much time just tweaking and tweaking and tweaking without having their audience go through it. So, if there's just one takeaway, I would say do the bare minimum to just have three to five or you can push yourself, do five to seven. And always batch those emails. Don't do one today. Okay, I'm going to do another tomorrow. Don't do that. Sit down and then batch it out. Like if you have like a chunk of time, like three hours or two hours or something like that, when your kids are in school or whatever that might be, just get those emails out. I think for email batching specifically helps very much because your mind is in that place, that zone, and you know exactly what comes next and all that. And I've noticed that when I have breaks in between and then I go off and do something else and come back, ""oh gosh, it's so difficult to get back in that."" So yeah.

[00:30:49.800] - Liz
Yeah, yeah. And we have sessions on batching because you don't have to sit down and do it all you can batch all the outlines and then the writing and then you have to go into the editing. So, don't feel like you have to like start finish in one sitting. Right. But, but try to get through all of them before you kind of move on to the next part of it, because that'll help with your writing too. All right. That was awesome. Thank you so much. Now, I know you have a free resource for our attendees. Do you want to tell us a little bit about it?

[00:31:21.570] - Meera
Yeah, sure. So, I have a free course on email. It's an email, course and emails together. But yeah. So, the link is the short link is Mira.email/course you can go and have it-

[00:31:35.820] - Liz
The link is on the page but yeah.

[00:31:36.930] - Meera
Yeah. The links there as well. So, if it's called Email List For Newbies. So, if you're just getting started out or you feel like your email marketing is really not up there, just go through it, give you a couple of ideas, help you take a couple of things and so on.

[00:31:53.130] - Liz
Awesome. Well, thank you so much, I really appreciate you being part of the Summit. And guys, don't- don't be afraid to ask questions like in the chat or reach out to her. Go get that email list, course whether you're new or not, because you're always going to learn something from someone else, I feel like. So, Meera thank you so much. I really appreciate you taking the time.

[00:32:14.700] - Meera
Thank you so much for having me. It was really fun to chatting with about email.

**Transcript:**
[00:00:12.540] - Meera
Hello, everyone. I'm Meera. I'm an in marketing strategist and author of the books, The 1 Hour Content Plan, Selling Intangible, 300 Email Marketing Tips, and a couple of others that you will see on Amazon. And today, I'm really excited to be speaking to you about a topic that is very near and dear to my heart.

[00:00:30.310] - Meera
We're going to be focusing on a specific aspect of email marketing, all right? And we're going to be diving really deep into the topic of newsletters.

[00:00:38.580] - Meera
So, for a lot of people that I work with, when they think of email, they think of a newsletter. Okay, this might be you as well. But is the newsletter the best tool for you to build trust with your audience, for you to build authority, and for you to guide your audience through that customer journey? That's what we're going to be discussing in today's session.

[00:01:00.900] - Meera
So, if you've always wanted to know whether the emails you're sending are the best fit, if you've always wanted to know the type of emails you should actually even be sending out to build trust and authority with your audience, then you are going to get a lot out of today's session. So, if you're ready, let's dive right in.

[00:01:17.580] - Meera
Now, before we talk about the type of emails that you should be sending and the role of the newsletter as one of those emails, right, let's look at the logic picture, okay? What role does email actually play in your larger content marketing strategy? Because for most people, they're very clear that they need to be creating content. All right. They know that they should be creating content, whether that is via a blog or a podcast or a YouTube channel. But email is something that they don't really know how to integrate. They always view email as being separate from their content strategy, so they always focus on their YouTube channel, their podcast, their blog, or even social media.

[00:02:06.540] - Meera
Okay. But email is something that they're just very, very unclear and they just don't know how to integrate that. But email is also another aspect of your larger content marketing strategy. So, everything has to be linked. So, if you've got your marketing and your business goals, okay, from there, you derive your content strategy. Okay, so content is not good to have, right? Content is something that has to be linked with your marketing and business goals. It's not a good to have or it's not a nice to have. It's integral, and it has to be linked to your marketing and business goals.

[00:02:45.450] - Meera
The content that you create has to be derived from those goals that you have. Or you can't say that, all right, I'm going to be creating this type of content because this type of content is the one that's going to help me go viral. All right. Yes, it might help you go viral, but it's not necessarily the type of content that's going to be attracting the right people to your brand ecosystem.

[00:03:11.100] - Meera
Now, when we're talking about email. I always like to refer to the five step activation process to kind of give you an idea of how the flow is like for someone who is coming into your brand ecosystem. So, let's say they hear you on a show, or they stumble across a post of yours or a show of yours.

[00:03:35.080] - Meera
All right?

[00:03:35.380] - Meera
So that is step one. That's your traffic soft, okay? So, from your traffic source, they would opt in to some kind of a free resource. It could be a lead magnet or a form of some kind. Okay, so that is where you capture their email address, all right and then you want to redirect them to a thank you page or a onetime offer page. So, a onetime offer page is where you have a very low-cost offer that you see. Some people call it a tripwire, okay?

[00:04:05.490] - Meera
So, this is to give them a taste of your paid content. So, the moment they encounter your thank you page or onetime offer, regardless of whether they buy or they don't, all right, then you send them a welcome email, and then you send them a nurture sequence. All right. It could be five to seven emails within an email sequence. So, this is the five-step activation process, and this is kind of like the journey that every single person who is coming into contact with your brand would take. Again, when you do it in this way, it ensures that you know, you're creating a very good experience for someone. And through the content that you're sending in your email sequence, they also get to know you and your brand better.

[00:04:49.390] - Meera
They get to know your point of view. They get to know the perspectives that you share when it comes to the topic of the problem that you're helping them solve. So, basically, you are creating a brand ecosystem with your list at the center. So, right at the center, you've got your email list. And regardless of where someone stumbles across your brand or where they come into contact with your brand, all right, all roads lead to your email list.

[00:05:20.460] - Meera
So, whether that's in social media, whether you are guesting for someone else, or whether you appear on someone else's show, or whether you have your own show, okay, regardless of where you have your brand footprint, all right, all roads should lead to your email list. Okay.

[00:05:39.880] - Meera
Now, one of the biggest email fails, and it's important to understand what this is, so that you're very clear about whether you are inadvertently making these mistakes due to the type of content that you're sending. Okay? So, how can it go wrong with email is if your email list can't connect you with your products or services, and your email list does not trust you. So, you may be sending content, but they still don't connect you with a particular topic, or they don't trust you, or they're just not able to see you with those offers.

[00:06:17.530] - Meera
Okay? They just can't make the connect. So, this is what I call content expert association. And when there is no content expert association, it is very, very difficult to be able to sell to your email list and very difficult for you to build authority and have a trusting relationship such that they want to do business with you. Okay.

[00:06:41.080] - Meera
Perhaps you're building a list of freebie seekers and not buyers, right? So, when you have a lead magnet that is not specific, that's not relevant, that has nothing to do with what you want to be known for, or has nothing to do with the offers that you have or the services that you're offering, then you are building a list of freebie seekers, again, not biased. Now, you may be adding a lot and lot of people to your email list, but these people may not be the right audience. These people may not be your ideal clients.

[00:07:15.630] - Meera
Now, if you have a list but you've not sent them anything, this is another type of problem to have, then obviously, you're not building trust and you're not going to be top of mind. And if you're not effectively selling via email, which means the content that you're sending doesn't prime or nudge your subscribers. Okay? So, now how does a newsletter come into play with these mistakes? Now, this is what I mean by a newsletter. Okay. Let's kind of get on the same page. For me, a newsletter is an email that has a couple of different links, again, it doesn't just focus on one main topic or one main message, right?

[00:07:55.240] - Meera
It typically has like a brief introduction. Okay, these are my favorite things, this is what I worked on. These are interesting links of mine that I have created based on content that I've created, or these are interesting links that I've come across from other sites on the web. So, this is typically how newsletters go, okay? Now due to the nature of a newsletter, okay, it does not help very much with brand recall. Right. It does not help very much for your audience to kind of remember the message of your offer or what you are about because there are so many different links.

[00:08:37.230] - Meera
And when there are so many different links, all right, it is harder for them to kind of understand what action you want them to take. Okay? So, I'm not saying that you should not be sending a newsletter, but newsletters generally, that's the only type of email that you're sending. I would highly suggest switching it up because like I said, it is just very difficult for people to be focused and take the action that you want them to take due to the multiple calls to action that are present within a newsletter.

[00:09:13.410] - Meera
Okay, so a newsletter is not the only type of email. You also have single goal emails, So, single goal emails are an email that is focused on, like I said, one main message or one main goal. Alright, you want them to take one specific action. So that specific action could be, all right, click this link, go read my blog post. Or it could be hit reply to this question. Or it could be take a survey. Or it could be to sign up for a waitlist. Or it could be to sign up for a launch vehicle, which could be a webinar or a workshop or a challenge.

[00:09:50.660] - Meera
Okay? And every single aspect of that email drives towards helping that person take that action. Okay? So, you are creating content within that email to nudge them, to take that specific action. So, those are single goal emails, okay? Now, campaign emails are tied to a larger campaign. It could be a launch campaign, it could be an affiliate campaign. All right. So, campaign emails are a string of emails, all related and all building towards this larger goal.

[00:10:23.490] - Meera
Okay? So, let's say you're having a launch for a mini course. All right. You will have a campaign of maybe seven to ten emails and every single email in that campaign, okay, nudges that subscriber or nudges that ideal client towards taking that final action at the end, which is to perhaps get them interested to sign up for that mini course or to build awareness. So that they have all the information they need to say yes or no to that offer that you're launching.

[00:11:04.120] - Meera
So, what we're trying to do here is determine what is the goal of the email, what is the goal of the campaign, and then focus on the action that you're tracking. So, let me swap back to the slide. If it's a single goal email, you want to determine, okay, what exactly is the action that I want them to take? Like I said, it could be sign up for the waitlist, send in an application, click over here to have a look at this link. All right. That is the action you're tracking, and the content in the email leads to that action. Now, same thing goes for campaign emails, okay? Now, campaign emails is slightly longer in a sense that you have to imagine the type of emails that someone would need in order to say yes to that larger goal at the end of that campaign.

[00:11:52.020] - Meera
So if, let's say, you want someone to have all the information they need in order to say yes or no to the offer you're launching, you need to work back and you need to reverse engineer and figure out. Okay, these are the types of content that I need to be sharing in all the information they need in order to say yes or no to that particular offer or to that particular action. So, when we're talking about reverse engineering, all right, and what is going to support them in the customer journey, what is going to give them all the information they need. So that they can either say yes or no and make an informed decision about your offer. Okay?

[00:12:31.090] - Meera
So, it's not all about saying yes, I want them to buy the offer. It's about helping them make an informed decision. That is what your content has to do. Okay, so when we are talking about that, it's about raising awareness. If they don't even know that there is a problem to be solved, how would they be able to say yes to your offer? So, these are different types of emails that you could potentially share.

[00:12:57.270] - Meera
Why did you create this offer? What is your process? What are the different frameworks or steps? What is your methodology? And how is this different from the other offers that are out there? What are the false beliefs or myths that they may be holding onto that may not necessarily be serving them? Okay. Or how is your take or your perspective different from the others that are out there? Okay. What stories can you share? Is there a client story? Is there your own story? Right now, when it comes to stories, it does not have to be a rags to riches story.

[00:13:32.050] - Meera
And those stories, I honestly really despise those because I feel it's kind of hard to connect to those stories. But when you share client stories, your interaction with people who are just like them, okay, and when there is a takeaway from that, those are the ones that people can really relate to. Okay,what mistakes may they be making? These are the types of emails that will help someone and support them through the customer journey. Now, these are the type of emails that really help to build trust. These are the types of emails that really help your audience see you as someone that they can approach when it comes to the topic of the offer.

[00:14:16.620] - Meera
They also help to build authority. It's not the typical email. These are emails that, yes, may require you to do some digging. All right? They may require you to really dig deep and think about, okay, hey, I have this offer, but how is this different?

[00:14:32.520] - Meera
What am I saying?

[00:14:33.480] - Meera
And how is what I'm saying different from the rest out there? What is my methodology? Okay, when you dig deep and when you share these in your emails, these are the types of emails that will really get your audience to engage with you, to respond back to you. All right?

[00:14:49.930] - Meera
And this is when you will get emails from people saying, you know, hey, I'm really glad I signed up. I never thought of it this way. You really brought, you shared with me a different perspective, something that I never considered before. And when you have people responding in this manner, you know you're on the right track because this is when people want to buy in to your offer. They want to buy into your work and your perspectives. Okay? Now, does a newsletter help you do all of this?

[00:15:21.240] - Meera
Well, like I said, because of the nature of a newsletter, because it has multiple links, it does not allow someone to dive deep into that topic. It does not allow a certain degree of depth because of the multiple calls to action, because of the very format of a newsletter. So, how does this relate to your larger year? So, when you're planning content for the year or for a quarter, specifically when it comes to emails. All right, this is how I would suggest doing it. So that every single email you're sending is intentional. Every single email you're sending is linked to your marketing and business goals. So, you want to take each quarter and you want to figure out, what exactly am I going to do in Jan, Feb, or March?

[00:16:12.790] - Meera
Okay. This could be perhaps, it could be having one promotion or having three specific mini projects that you're launching. Okay? Now based on that, you want to reverse engineer and figure out. All right. So, let's say in February, you're going to be launching a book, or you're going to be launching a mini course. Then you want to say, okay, what are the types of emails I need to be sending my email list to prime them for this launch? Okay, what are the different messages that they need to be hearing from me, so that they are prepared to take action, or they have all the information they need and they are aware, so that they can take action.

[00:16:56.470] - Meera
So, this is how you would reverse engineer and determine the type of emails that you would be sending out. Now, what if you have no products when you're starting out? So, let's say you have no offers right now. So, in that case, how can you get intentional with the type of emails you're sending. You can still do so. All right, you can still get very intentional. And this is exactly what I did when I started out. And I was very new to business.

[00:17:22.090] - Meera
You know, I didn't have any offers at all. I created authority building campaign. So, I wanted to be known for certain things or certain messages, and all my emails were centered around those messages. And when I did it in that way, it really helped to build trust and it helped to build authority. Okay. Or if you are thinking of creating an offer, it could be a service, it could be a coaching offer, or it could even be a digital product. You could create emails around building an interest list. So, your goal or the action that you want them to take would be to sign up for the interest list. And all the emails that you're creating is set up to build awareness, is set up to support them to take that action.

[00:18:05.280] - Meera
Okay, then obviously we spoke about launch campaigns. You could also do the same with affiliate campaigns. So, it doesn't have to be your own offer. It could be someone else's offer that you're promoting. But the same thing goes. You still need to create content to support them, okay, and to provide them with the information they need in order to say yes or no to that action.

[00:18:26.910] - Meera
So, you want to reverse engineer and figure out what your audience needs to know or what your audience needs to believe in order to be able to take that action. Now, is it easy to do all of this with a newsletter? Like I said, because of the nature of the newsletter, it has multiple calls to action. It is difficult to keep your subscribers focus on the main message or the main action that you want them to take or that you want them to recall.

[00:18:58.020] - Meera
So, I would suggest using newsletters between campaigns. Okay, so let's say, you've launched something and then you have your next promotion or your next offer a couple of weeks later. Okay. You've got a space in between, and this is where you can use a newsletter. But if a newsletter is the only type of email that you're sending, I would highly suggest trying these other types of emails. Okay, so let me just stop to share right now.

[00:19:27.670] - Meera
I hope today's session got you thinking about the type of emails you're sending to your email list. Maybe it gave you a burst of inspiration about the different types of emails that you could possibly be sending out as well. If you want to dive deeper into the topic of emails, I do have a free email course. It's called Email List for Newbies and you can access that at this short link meera.email/course.

[00:19:51.870] - Meera
Okay, so if emails on your radar, this is one of the first few resources that I would suggest you check out. The other one would be my book on Amazon called 300 Email Marketing Tips. So, I look forward to taking this conversation forward and connecting with you via email and I hope you enjoy the rest of your summit. Bye.

[00:00:03.650] - Sage Grayson
Hey there. Welcome to Inbox Joy, themed email newsletters for effortless marketing. Thank you so much for joining me today. Get ready to supercharge your emails to make your subscribers feel seen and appreciated so you get more sales. Before we get started, please be sure to grab a notebook or your favorite planner so you can take notes because I don't want you to miss a thing. Ready to find your Inbox Joy? All right, let's go. If this is the first time we're meeting, please allow me to introduce myself. I'm Sage Grayson, and I'm a former book editor turned life and business coach. Since 2011, I've been helping ambitious women entrepreneurs edit their habits, routines, and mindsets to balance their happiness at work and home. Or as I like to say, I'm a life editor, and so are you. I'm a vegan, bisexual Buddhist who loves reading self-development books and quoting The Simpson endlessly. You can find me on YouTube for my business channel, YouTube for my reading channel, Facebook, Pinterest, and of course, my blog, sagegrayson.com. Here are our course objectives. First, we're going to talk about why email newsletters are the number one marketing tactic you should be using to build trust, Keep your audience engaged and get more sales.

[00:01:33.100] - Sage Grayson
We like that. You're also going to learn how to use theme newsletters to crank out content faster and help your subscribers hone in on the information they need next. I've also got a dozen newsletter theme ideas to spark your creativity so you can plan your themes as soon as possible. Then I'm going to show you how to take your email newsletter up a notch with advanced theming tactics. Let's get right into it. Let's talk about email newsletters 101. Email newsletters are recurring messages sent to subscribers to share valuable content, updates, or promotions. I think we recognize what an email newsletter is. Basically, somebody will sign up for your email newsletter through one of your freebies. This is called permission marketing, where you're going to give them something cool and exciting, and in return, they give you their email address. That's how you build your email newsletter subscriber list. For online business owners, newsletters are powerful marketing tools that build customer relationships and increase loyalty, trust, and brand recognition. Just think about the email newsletters that you receive. You definitely recognize those brands and you learn to trust them over time. Here's the thing. Regular engaging newsletters keep your business top of mind.

[00:02:51.600] - Sage Grayson
I have said this a million times. When somebody is ready to buy whatever it is that you sell, we want you and your business to be the person that they think of. Newsletters also encourage clicks, they drive sales, and they lead to consistent customer engagement. We want all of these things for your business, and that's why you really must set up your email newsletter. Now, email newsletters work best when you give your subscribers some variety. Yes, we don't want the same old thing all the time. You don't want to send duplicates of the same email over and over and over again. Because if your audience gets bored of your messages, they might unsubscribe. We don't want that. We want them to stay subscribed so they know all about your new products and offers. Now, a great way to keep their eyes on your emails is to choose themes so they can anticipate your message and hone in on what's important to them. You got to make it fun. I can't stress this enough. I get so many email newsletters that just aren't fun. It's like a straight wall of text and they're super boring. You've got to have some fun with your email newsletters.

[00:04:00.840] - Sage Grayson
You started your business for a reason. Don't you want to have fun with it? If your email newsletters are fun, then your readers are going to keep opening them, and we want that. Okay, so why do we want themes for our email newsletters? Can't we just send an email newsletter and be done with it? Can't we just wing it every week and write about whatever we want to? Well, yeah, sure. Of course you can. But I guarantee that your life and your business will run a lot smoother if you just take the time to choose some themes for your newsletters. Here are some great reasons why you should start using themed newsletters. First, it's easier content planning. So themes act as a guide for each newsletter, so you know exactly what to include. You're not sitting there in front of the blank screen thinking, What am I supposed to be talking about? What should I put in this newsletter? With a clear topic, content creation becomes so much faster and less stressful We like that. We like less stress. I mean, you've got a million of other things that you need to be thinking about for your business.

[00:05:06.630] - Sage Grayson
So let's make this easy. Themes also build anticipation and engagement. Subscribers look forward to your specific themes, like maybe you have the Fun Friday email or a Wealth Wednesday. This consistency keeps your audience engaged and excited for what's next. I definitely recognize when other business owners are using themes, and I'm so excited. I'm like, oh, it's tip Tuesday, what tip are they going to give me? We want people expecting your emails and looking forward to opening them. Themes also give your newsletter and your business cohesive branding. So theme newsletters create this recognizable rhythm to your brand, making your emails memorable and strengthening your brand identity. I bet you have definitely recognized some business owners that do the Monday, Wednesday, Friday emails, and it definitely has a rhythm to their information. You know when you're going to get something good from them. Themes also improve readability. I can't stress this enough. You need to have themes that make your emails easy to read. So when subscribers know what to expect, then they can quickly find the information relevant to them, increasing open rates and engagement. This is not a long wall of text, which I see too many times.

[00:06:23.470] - Sage Grayson
You've got to make your emails scannable. And this starts with a clear banner, probably with whatever theme that email newsletter has. Short paragraphs. I keep my paragraphs no longer than two lines of text, like short, easily scannable paragraphs. And lots and lots of headers. You want to break up the text. Use headers, use bullet points. Make your email scannable. Because let's face it, as much as we want our subscribers to read every single word that we send them, they're not. They're just not. When you have themed email newsletters, you can make them scannable, you can make them shorter, more to the point, so people can find the information they need quickly. You might also try themes with a segmented focus. Now, I will say this doesn't apply to everyone, so it may or may not work for your business. But themed content also allows you to target various aspects of your business, like membership updates or product promotions, so that each audience segment receives relevant information just for them. So you can absolutely segment your audience. Maybe you send things to the business owners or just to the moms or just to the people who bought this specific product, or maybe people who don't have that specific product.

[00:07:38.280] - Sage Grayson
I definitely recommend sending your marketing emails to people who do not have a specific product. There's nothing worse than getting an email for a product that you've already bought, especially if it's on sale now. If you don't want to segment your audience or if that's not in alignment with what you do for your business, you can just send your emails to everyone. And this is what I do. So I do have a membership subscription, and I send those emails to everyone, not just the people who are in the membership. That way, I am promoting it to the people who are not in the membership and they're seeing all the good stuff that they're missing. And I'm reminding the current members that they need to log in and get more value out of their membership. And that way, they will stay in the membership and keep paying month after month. Themes also encourage action. You know what that means? Sales. Themes naturally lead to calls to action or CTAs tailored to each topic, whether it's joining a membership, purchasing a product, reading a new blog post, watching a video, sharing feedback. You're encouraging them to do something within that themed email.

[00:08:46.400] - Sage Grayson
You're never leaving them hanging. You're always leading them to the next step. I've got a dozen theme examples that you might want to try out for your newsletters. Let's start with Membership Mondays. I see this one a lot. And before we go further, I do want to say that though a lot of these are themed to specific days, you don't need to make an alliteration. You don't have to actually put the day of the week in there. That will also give you the option to send these emails anytime during the week, not locked into a specific day. If you do have a membership, I recommend sending a membership email at least once a week. Like I said before, it's going to show the people who aren't in the membership everything that they're missing so that they join, and it's going to encourage current members to stay engaged in the membership and keep paying. How about a testimonial Tuesday? Or this could be Success Story Saturdays. Either way, you're going to highlight the people in your business who are getting those good results. Yeah, let them brag about you and your products and services rather than you just saying how great you are.

[00:09:49.820] - Sage Grayson
It's always nice to show someone who has gotten success doing whatever it is that you're teaching. That way your audience can self-select. They'll look at the testimonial and say, Hey, She looks just like me. She has a business just like me. And look at the results that she got. Testimonials and success stories also make your current subscribers want to get good results so they can appear in your next testimonial newsletter. How about Wealth Wednesdays? This would be great for a finance coach or a law of attraction coach or anyone who's helping you earn more money. Maybe you've got a great tip to help them increase their sales, or maybe you've got a mindset shift that they need to make if they want to earn over six figures. How about Training Thursdays? This could be for any type of trainings that you have. Maybe you highlight a different free training every Thursday that they can opt in for and learn something new and it can gently upsell to one of your paid products. Throwback Thursday. Oh, yeah. Let's get retro here. I bet you have tons of old blog posts, old videos, or content that's just sitting around your shop not being sold.

[00:10:58.210] - Sage Grayson
So how about you highlight a a throwback every Thursday, something that they've probably forgotten about. Or if they're a new subscriber, they definitely haven't read or haven't watched that video. So bring it back to the forefront with a throwback Thursday email. Fun Fridays are super, super popular because sometimes you have things that just don't fit anywhere else. Maybe it's not promoting one of your products, maybe it's not saying what bundle or summit you're in. Maybe it's not a testimonial, but it's things that you do want to share with your list. You can have a roundup or a catch all email and make it a Fun Friday. So everything that doesn't belong somewhere else gets put into the Fun Friday email. This is also your chance to be a real person and show them that you're a human just like them and you're doing fun things with your life. Maybe show them some behind-the-scenes details of your life, of your business, or how you do the things that you teach. How about a Saturday sales spotlight? You could highlight a different product or service in your shop every Saturday and really shine the spotlight on it.

[00:12:02.490] - Sage Grayson
Don't assume that simply because you have a shop or an everything page, that people have seen all of your offers. They haven't. And something that you released three months ago, six months ago, a year ago, I definitely know that people have forgotten about it. So bring those offers back into the forefront and highlight a different product every Saturday. A Sunday roundup is also a great way to end the week. Very similar to a fun Friday. It's all of the stuff that doesn't really belong anywhere else. You could gather up all the important things that happened during the week, the bundles and summits that you're in, the blog posts that you published, the videos that you released, any new items in your shop, and just have a long list of things that happened that week so they can catch up quickly. I know some people even have the option where you can subscribe simply to their roundup and not all of their other emails. That way you're getting fewer emails, but you're getting the one that highlights everything they missed. Speaking of highlights, how about affiliate highlights? You could have an email to your affiliates or to everyone on your list talking about your affiliate program.

[00:13:09.430] - Sage Grayson
If you do send it to everyone on your list, you're reminding them that you have an affiliate program and they can sign up and earn some money, and you're reminding your current affiliates to share their links and get paid again. You might even give them swipe copy or some tips to help them earn more money with their affiliate links. You might also share a success story from one of your affiliates who is out there earning a lot of money with your links. Tools and tips Tuesdays? Yes. I bet you have lots of software, books, tools, resources, and other things that you use. You could share those affiliate links in a roundup email with all of the other tips that help you do what you do in your business. I know I always love seeing what other bits of software and resources people are using to get those good results. So have an email that shares all of these tips with your subscribers. And I'll put this one in here too. It's a monthly email, but it's monthly must haves. So maybe it's everything that you really enjoyed this month. The things that you bought on Amazon, the blog post that you loved reading, other people's products and offers.

[00:14:13.440] - Sage Grayson
Maybe it's even seasonal things that go along with the holidays. Everyone loves seeing a wishlist, so show your subscribers your must haves in this roundup email. All right, I've got some advanced newsletter tips for you if you are going to be using these themed newsletter ideas. You can experiment with frequency. You knew I was going to say this. I send daily emails to my list, and that might work for you, but you could switch it up. Maybe you do three times a week, like a Monday, Wednesday, Friday. Or you could do weekly if you haven't been sending email newsletters often. Simply going from monthly to weekly newsletters can definitely increase your engagement and help you get more sales. I want you to give yourself permission to test different frequencies for your themes to see what really resonates with your audience. And make sure that you can keep up with that schedule yourself. Then you could also try seasonal or holiday variations. You can adapt themes to reflect the seasons or holidays, making them feel fresh and timely. This is something I do a lot with my business. For example, you can adjust your Fun Fridays to include year-end best of content in December.

[00:15:20.200] - Sage Grayson
Or you could try a self-love series around Valentine's Day. There might be specific holidays or times of year that are important to you and your field, so take advantage of those. Again, this is all about having fun with your newsletters, because if your email newsletters aren't fun, then no one's going to read them. Use A/B testing. You can experiment with different subject lines, formats, or content within each theme. So A/B test two versions of your Membership Monday newsletter to see which one has the higher open rate and click rates. So for example, you might put your call to action at the top of the newsletter for one, and then at the bottom of the newsletter for the other, and see which one gets more opens and more clicks. Leverage user-generated content. Encourage subscribers to contribute stories, tips, or photos, and then feature them in your newsletters. A theme like Testimonial Tuesdays can showcase real customer feedback, making them feel connected and involved in your business. You definitely want to repurpose your theme across multiple platforms. So use your newsletter themes as content inspiration across social media, in your blog posts, in your videos, or community content.

[00:16:32.210] - Sage Grayson
This makes it so easy. You don't have to come up with something new to share in every single one of these platforms. Repurpose anything you can. And then I, of course, love time-limited content. You can use dynamic elements like real-time countdowns within your themes. For instance, a Saturday sales spotlight can feature a limited time discount on a product. I do this all the time. This is why it's important. This trains your subscribers to open your emails in a timely manner so that they won't miss the deals. I think we all have times where people don't open our emails for days and days, and then they miss out on something. If you have these limited time offers, they're going to open your emails the moment that it pops into their inbox. Before I let you go, if you enjoyed this course on themed email newsletters, then I know you're just going to love evergreen email sequences for endless sales.

[00:00:12.270] - Trevann Hamilton
Hey, everyone. Welcome. I'm so excited that you're here. I'm excited to be back. This is my second year presenting. My name is Trevann from your writing bestie. Today, I'm going to teach you how to create a newsletter that your audience will love. Here's what you can expect. First, I'm going to talk a little bit about myself. Then, I'm going to have a quick chat about newsletters. Then, we're going to talk about how to create an awesome newsletter, how to up your newsletter game, and how I can support you. Get your pen and paper or whatever you take notes on out, and let's get started. Hi, again. I'm Trevann, the founder of Your Writing Bestie, a content marketing and copywriting company that helps women service providers, usually in the marketing and health niche, generate leads and sales. One of the ways I do that is by creating and writing newsletters. My clients and your writing bestie enjoy open rates of 20 to 50% for newsletters and other emails. I currently run two newsletters for Your Writing Bestie. I might be doing a third this year. The first one is the your writing bestie newsletter, where I share bite-size writing and SEO tips.

[00:01:35.440] - Trevann Hamilton
The second one is Freelance Writing Stories, where I share tips with early career freelance writers to help them navigate the freelance world. I published The Your Writing Bestie Newsletter on LinkedIn and Kit, and it blew up on LinkedIn. I have over 12,000 subscribers and received a newsletter sponsor in 2024. They managed to sponsor a couple months, and for me, that was amazing. Does anyone here already have a newsletter? If you do, let me know in the chat. If you don't, you're probably wondering, do I even need a newsletter? Here are some reasons I think that you may need a newsletter. First one, if you want to connect with and nurture your audience, you probably want to get a newsletter. If you want You want to establish another income stream, you might want to get a newsletter. Remember, with a newsletter, you can get a sponsor, you can put ads in, you can promote your products and services, there is affiliate marketing, there's so much you can do. You may want more website traffic. You can actually lead your subscribers to your website or blog and therefore increase your traffic. If you want to build your email list, a newsletter is a great way to do that.

[00:02:59.180] - Trevann Hamilton
A newsletter If it's just one type of email, but maybe you want to send sales emails later, you'll already have a list, so that will increase your chances of getting sales. Here are a few key stats that you might want to know about. 81% of B2B marketers choose newsletters as their preferred form of content marketing. 31% of marketers use email newsletters as a main channel to nurture leads, and 95% Gen Z, millennials and Gen X get newsletters. If you're wondering about boomers, I believe it's around 84%, something like that. If you want to create an awesome newsletter, it's time. The first thing I would suggest is to write down your goals. Before you do anything in your business, ensure you have clear goals, and creating a newsletter is no exception. I recommend the SMART method. Smart stands for a specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time bound. For example, I want to increase traffic to my blog by 30% in six months using my monthly newsletter. That's an example of a smart goal. Next, I would say create a budget. That's not because newsletters are expensive or anything like that. You can actually start a newsletter with exactly zero dollars and zero cents.

[00:04:29.970] - Trevann Hamilton
But you might want to invest in it soon, now or later. Here are some things you can consider paying for. An email writer and marketer. They can help you to nurture and sell to your email list. You may want to pay for an email marketing platform. Many of them do have free plans, but maybe they don't suit you, or you just want to dive in and start paying right away. You can also pay for a social media marketer that can help you get newsletters signups from your social media platforms. Next, I would recommend researching email marketing platforms. There are many out there, and it can be a little overwhelming, but just focus on your goals and your budget. Here are some things you might want to consider. The cost. So if you're just starting out or on a tight budget, consider using one with a free plan. The types of emails you want to send. There are some that are better for more visual emails like MailerLite and the ease of use. You have to be the one to decide if you like that email marketing platform, if you can use it easily. You are the person who is running your email marketing services.

If neither of you like the platform, then it's probably not going to work. So this is the most important step. The audience comes first, and your newsletter is actually supposed to serve them. So ask your audience what they want. If you want your newsletter to make your audience excited to open your emails monthly or weekly, then you need their input. You can do that by asking them directly, Hey, I'm creating a newsletter. What do you want to see in it? It sets up interviews, or you can read about your audience on sites like Reddit or Quora. You check them out to see what your target audience is talking about, what problems they're having, what questions they're asking. That is a great way to help you make and design an email newsletter that serves the purpose you need it to serve, which is your audience. They come first. I can't state that enough. Next, peek at your competitor. You should definitely avoid copying them, but you can look at what they're doing and see how you can improve it. So I recommend checking out their newsletter sign-up strategies, checking out exactly what they're writing about, and figuring out their strengths and weaknesses.

[00:07:26.530] - Trevann Hamilton
Next, and this is my favorite part, creating an outline. While your newsletter outline can change over time, coming up with a basic outline can save you so much time and energy when you sit down to write it. So I recommend writing down headings and sections that you know your audience will care about, paying attention to your layout, and saving your outline as a template so that you have it later on. So let's look at an example. Meet Anna, someone that I completely made up. She's a personal finance blogger who helps Gen Z women manage their money, earn more, and thrive. She also makes YouTube videos on these personal finance topics. Anna offers coaching services for people who need help with their budget and sell digital products. Her budget for email marketing is $150 per month. She has two main goals, which is to increase sales and traffic. She has evergreen products and a coaching program, so she wants to sell those to her audience. And so her goal is to increase her sales by 20% within six months. And she wants to increase traffic to her website by 15% within six months. Here's an example of a newsletter outline that I would suggest.

[00:08:53.680] - Trevann Hamilton
It wouldn't be written in this format. It would probably be written in a Google Doc, but I thought this looked pretty. So This is why I did it like this. The first thing I would say is probably to add a header. You definitely don't have to do that. But let's say you named the newsletter Anna's Personal Finance Tips or something like that. Let's say for the first month, we're talking about credit card debt. You could put that in the header or you can keep it the same all the time where you just have the name of the newsletter or your blog's logo or your picture, anything like that. Then I would suggest having a section where there's just a quick chat and update where you say, Hey, first name. Of course, the email marketing platform will put in the correct name and you'd say, Okay, here's what's going on in my life. Here's how this topic relates to you, or this is the topic that we're going to go over. Before I continue, whenever you're adding personalizations, make sure you hit the Preview so you can see if it's actually going to put in the person's first name because maybe you've gotten emails that it actually says, Hey, first name.

[00:10:22.320] - Trevann Hamilton
So you don't want that. Anyways, the next section would be a tip or a story. Either give a quick tip or include a story about a mistake that you made and how you fixed it. So if we're going off the credit card debt theme, maybe Anna was in credit card debt, and she's going to share one method that helped her get out of it. Next, you would include resources. You could include a blog, products that you have, digital products that you have that could help the reader get out of credit card debt, a YouTube video that spoke about that same thing, anything like that. And then a concluding section. You don't have to write a words conclusion. You can just continue writing. You can say, Hey, this is what the next newsletter is going to be about. You can ask them a question, or you could just leave some closing remarks. Now it's time to set a schedule. Many entrepreneurs often start newsletters and stop them soon after. Consistency is key. I know you've heard that many times, but it's true. One of the best ways to stay consistent is to set a schedule and stick to it.

[00:11:41.130] - Trevann Hamilton
I recommend just creating a schedule that works for you. If you can't do weekly newsletters, that's okay. Do it bi-monthly, do it monthly. Then tell people when to expect your newsletter. I find that helps you to stay accountable. My newsletters are monthly, and I constantly post about that. It makes me feel as if I really do have to put out a newsletter monthly because I don't want to disappoint anyone. You can adjust your schedule anytime. I recommend letting them know that, Hey, The weekly newsletter isn't working out for me. I'm switching to monthly. I'm switching to bi-monthly. Now it's time to send it. And if it's your first newsletter, it might be a little scary. Well, if I'm being honest, it's always a little scary to send off a newsletter. You might be wondering, Is this one great? Did I make a mistake? There are so many things that will run through your mind, and that's normal. Read it over for errors. Make sure you personalize it. There's a lot of debate.

[00:12:51.410] - Trevann Hamilton
There is a lot of debate about whether or not you should add someone's name to an email. Personally, I love doing that. Just don't overdo I open emails when I see my name in the subject line, let me know if that's the same for you. A lot of other people like it. I mean, it really depends on you and your audience. You can try it out and see how your audience reacts it, but personally, I think it's fine. And finally, you should craft an irresistible subject line because it would suck to write a great newsletter, but the subject line isn't great, and then less people open it. Here's just a summary of all that I just said. Next, let's get into the bestie method. This is the bestie method for newsletter success. It is so simple. Trust me. The first thing is to be consistent. You don't want to ignore your email list for long periods of time. That will hurt your relationship with your list and your sales. You want to engage with your list. Of course, your subscribers want to feel valued and heard, so make sure you engage with them. I recommend a welcome sequence in place to engage and nurture them right off the bat.

[00:14:15.770] - Trevann Hamilton
I would say that you should encourage them to hit reply with questions. Sometimes I'll ask my subscribers, Hey, what do you guys want to see in the next newsletter? Or what's something that you're really struggling with right now? And then I'll use that in subsequent newsletters so that they're getting what they need. I would then say you should schedule your newsletters in advance. Scheduling them in advance will help you to stay consistent, motivated, and free of your time. You can take a look at your analytics. They will tell you a lot. I pay attention to the open rate and the links that the subscribers are clicking. Next, invest in your newsletter, whether that means investing in your skill, the email platform, writers, whatever it is. You'll have to invest in it. Next, and finally, earn from your newsletter. You can earn from your newsletter by getting sponsorship, ads, affiliate marketing links, promoting your products and services. The list goes on. You may have some newsletter challenges such as cost. You may think you don't have the budget for a newsletter, but again, you can start with no money. The time, maybe you don't have the time to create newsletters.

[00:15:45.460] - Trevann Hamilton
One thing you can do is create a schedule. So for Your Writing Bestie and for my clients, at the top of the year from January to December, and I actually write what the theme of the newsletter will be. That helps me to stay consistent, and it saves me a lot of time. Next, you might be worried about your skill. Can you write an email? I know that blogging and email writing are two different things. I started out as a blogger, so I get it. You might be worried about your return on investment. You may feel like it's not worth the investment or it's taking too long for you to see the return. That's fair. It's the long game. It takes a while to build up a list. That's okay if you're having these challenges and fears. But here's how I can support you. We can create an amazing newsletter.
