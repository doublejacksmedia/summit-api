[00:00:12.270] - Liz Stapleton, Host
All right, guys. I'm really excited to welcome back Katherine Pomerantz. Katherine and I go way back, I think almost like 10 years now at this point. It was like, I think in 2016, I think in San Diego that we met. Maybe it was even before.

[00:00:23.880] - Katherine Pomerantz
No, I think it was. No, it was Dallas, but that was 2016.

[00:00:28.460] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Maybe 2017. I've actually known you quite a long time, which is crazy. Super excited to have you back. I know you've got some stuff prepared for us. I'm excited to learn. I'm excited to ask questions. I'm going to let you lead the way.

[00:00:43.420] - Katherine Pomerantz
Well, thank you so much. I have a little slideshow just because I'm going to go through some jargony things. There's things for people to visually follow along with us. I'll get that started. Why don't we start there? Then we can do the official intro. Okay, are you seeing my- Yes. Okay, great. Seeing the slides. Fabulous. Okay. Right. Yeah, I am excited to be back. This is my third Blogger Breakthrough Summit. Every year, we find a new and unique way to approach taxes and money. Every year, it feels like they make it even more valuable. We had discussed, How should we do it again this year? I decided, Let's do an interview because today, I am not going to go easy on anyone listening. I am going to talk through some advanced tax strategy, tax planning stuff. Even if you're a beginner, but you were like, This is a topic that's really interesting to me, you're going to want to know strategy strategy sooner rather than later. I'll show why you want to start mapping these ahead of time in just a minute. But for now, know that Liz is here to not only be your summit host and beautiful guide, but she can be your stand-in.

[00:01:56.930] - Katherine Pomerantz
Liz promised today to ask me all the questions for everybody.

[00:02:01.300] - Liz Stapleton, Host
I will because I don't shy away from questions.

[00:02:03.790] - Katherine Pomerantz
Absolutely great. There's an immense value in getting to do this live because I am an actual financial expert. This is not a Google search. This is not going to be general tax information that's going to be in a blog post, which are fabulous, by the way, and I support all of my bloggers who are talking about money or tax topics because that's a great starting point. But the advantage of when you get to do a summit or get to do things like this is that you tailor the specific details to your exact situation. The year is 2025. We're going to be talking about the US tax code. We're going to be talking to people who are scaling a blog and side hustle income, maybe stretching to making this full-time income, maybe stretching to building a team. There is a great opportunity to discuss this in a way that is going to be really useful. For everyone watching, trust that Liz has got you if you've got more questions. If you have a If there's additional questions, I will make sure I'm in that Facebook group for everybody to contact us after the replay. It's a very, very bold claim.

[00:03:11.040] - Katherine Pomerantz
Should I actually introduce myself? We didn't actually do that part, right?

[00:03:14.370] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Yeah, probably a good idea. They might want to know how you know all this fun stuff.

[00:03:20.250] - Katherine Pomerantz
Right. How can I claim all this expertise? My brief intro. I am Katherine Pomerantz. I am an actress turned accountant and money coach. That's important to my story because as an artist, I really struggled with money. I was working three, sometimes four jobs, and I could barely pay my bills. I realized, finally, hard work was not my problem. I was working 60, 80 hours a week, and I still wasn't making enough money. I also, being an artist, got to see a lot of weird mindsets around money. Famously, the serving artist mentality is a thing. That's a true stereotype for a reason. But I grew up with a diversity of socioeconomic backgrounds in my family and my friends grew up at my school. I got to see different examples of why... How much money you earn doesn't necessarily mean you're It's a correspond to how much you're happy or how well you are feeling about it. I knew I was working really hard, but I still wasn't making enough money. I knew that having different types of amounts of money wasn't necessarily corresponding to how we experienced it. I was like, Okay, there's something about money I don't know, something I haven't been taught.

[00:04:36.180] - Katherine Pomerantz
If I could figure that out, I think I could help a lot of people. This eventually became the money storyteller method. When I started to study money, I fell in love with it. I launched my own accounting firm about a year after having that thought of, I wonder if I could figure out money and help people. I was like, A year later, I am running my own accounting firm. I'm doing business taxes. We're doing bookkeeping, we're doing all the things. I I was so good at it so quickly because of my storyteller background, because I come at it from an artist's perspective. Money at its heart is like any human language, like choreography, color, like design, all of that is a way of taking abstract concepts, making sense of our chaos, and telling stories. Humans invented money. We cannot help it. It's how we make sense of things. When money does that, it helps us make sense of how are we using our resources. What is our plans for the future. These are all the reasons we have forecast. Now, today, we're going to deep dive on taxes, which is one holistic part of this framework.

[00:05:39.380] - Katherine Pomerantz
But here's the core message of that that's going to be really helpful in making advanced tax strategies feel easy, and dare I say it, fun, is money is a creative language. We can use that to map out and then measure and then actually achieve ambitious goals. Storytelling is going to be our inroad to making financial stuff easier and more fun. When we can do that, money is going to become a teammate in our story. As we grow this blog, instead of working so, so, so, so hard and maybe scraping out some money, money can be put to work for you. Money can work hard on your behalf. I have helped hundreds of clients one-on-one through my firm, and I have taught thousands of students in workshops just like that. Liz already said how long we've known each other, almost 10 years. I've been running my business. I've been working on the same amount of time. I have helped so many people master this idea using this method. This is where I'd like to start today. This is you. This is your blog. Take a minute and remember, you started this blog for a reason, and you control everything about this blog.

[00:06:50.930] - Katherine Pomerantz
You're going to control everything about how it makes money and how you're going to spend that money. In every moment, even if we can't immediately change our external circumstances, you're only making so much money, you only have so many hours in the day, we can choose how to think about and therefore how to use that money. That's what I want us to do. When we start talking taxes, what is your money story? This is where I want you to start. Just what happened to you this year? How did you make income? How did you spend it? Did you have a significant life event, like a birth or a marriage? How did you invest and save? This is how you should start getting ready for tax season every year because money is going to affect every single area of your life, and taxes are affected by every area of your money. Start by telling me your story, and then I can help you find the exact scenarios that are going to give you the most tax savings. Now, I know I said earlier, blog posts are just going to give you general information, but this is how you can start taking the most time to look for taking control of that story and doing your own research.

[00:08:02.300] - Katherine Pomerantz
If I know my exact scenarios, if I know my story, I can then go search for resources like blog posts, like experts like me who can do the taxes for me. I can tell that story and I can filter the information they're giving me so that I can apply it to myself and win. Does that make sense, Liz, before I just keep running past?

[00:08:22.600] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Yeah, no, I think it does.

[00:08:24.690] - Katherine Pomerantz
Okay, great. Fabulous. If you're watching this recording, you can hit pause and literally just start listing out your life events at this point, and you've done everything you need to to prep for this year's coming tax season. This is coming out at the start of the year, start of tax season. This is everything you need to get organized. You get nothing else out of today's training. This is already on the a wildly successful. I'm so proud of you. But I'm going to give you a little bit more. I am going to give you because here's a question that I get a lot with clients, especially when they're self-employed. It's like, What do I focus on first? Is it important to get my bookkeeping handled? Is it important to set aside tax savings? Is it important to When should I build my cash buffer? When should I reinvest in my business? When do I need to hire a tax repairer? Do I need to do a retirement account? How much? I could be paying down debt, or I could be investing in my blog, or I could be saving for retirement, or I could pay myself.

[00:09:11.390] - Katherine Pomerantz
What do I focus on when? No matter when you're starting this process or with how much money you're starting this process, I have a flowchart that I like to take people through. Ten steps to tax strategy. If you do these 10 things in this order, it has some advantages. In one, it scales up by level of complexity, so I have the easiest things first. If you nail these easier things, great, you're ready for some of the things that are a little bit more difficult. It also will then scale up in terms of when is it necessary based on how much money you're making. If you're just getting started, pay lots of attention to the first step. If you feel like you already have a handle on it, start doing the work you need to do to do some of the middle steps. If you're in it and you're like, Okay, I've done all these things that I have no idea what step six is, Great. Time to do some research or find an expert and then keep going down the flowchart. This flowchart is not a one-year tech strategy. This is a lifetime tech strategy.

[00:10:10.620] - Katherine Pomerantz
Keep this recording, buy the upgrades so that you can get the recordings. Use this for the rest of time, the rest of the time you're running your blog, to really take advantage of the income streams that you're going to be building for yourself to make sure you're saving as much money as possible and keeping as much as possible for your family and for the reason you started this blog and wanted to monetize it in the first place. Excited? Ready?

[00:10:36.490] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Yes.

[00:10:37.030] - Katherine Pomerantz
Okay, thank you. I'm always way more excited than everyone else is talking.

[00:10:40.980] - Liz Stapleton, Host
You know I love talking money. You know I'm actually excited.

[00:10:43.960] - Katherine Pomerantz
I know. You're formerly a lawyer in a previous life, so you're very good at that, or you understand it's dry, but we need it, right? Okay, so tax strategy flowchart, 10 steps. What are these Ninja moves for you to get started on your tax planning? Create a money map. What is a money map? A money map is simply an outline of that story. Every good story needs a treasure map. This is what is going to point us in the right direction of where we want the story to go. These are all the things that have happened, and this is what I want to have happen in the future. You're running a blog. You want to make as much profit as possible in that blog, and then you want to strategically map out how you're going to split that profit between tax savings, between paying between saving for retirement so that you are taking care of short term and long term tax strategies, et cetera. But before you do anything else, you just need to have a plan. You just have to have a plan and you have to have a system in order to know, Okay, I'm going to make money, and then I'm going to set aside part of that money to pay my taxes, to pay myself, and to do any other, save up for a house, pay down debt, do retirement.

[00:11:54.540] - Katherine Pomerantz
Map out what you want with your money. Then build some cash saving. This is This is often called an emergency fund, if you've ever looked at personal finance stuff before. But this is important even as you grow a blog, and even if your blog is very small, because your blog has recurring expenses just to stay alive. You've got your website, your domain subscription, any software that you're using, any tech that you're using when you start building out funnels and ways you actually make money in your blog, anything you're using to make social media and content creation easier. Those cost money. So your blog should start to build its own cash to start paying for its own thing. This is going to help when your blog has low income, but you don't have to keep funneling cash back into it. This is also important for tax strategy because the number one way to reduce your taxes is to pay your taxes on time every time. Where I see the biggest tax troubles start to happen is when people scale their money up and they don't have enough saved and they're not ready for that next big tax bill because they jump tax brackets and now it's more complicated and they have to handle self-employment tax and everything else, and they owe more than they expect.

[00:13:06.240] - Katherine Pomerantz
Then they end up with a payment plan to the IRS that has penalties and interest that is even harder to get out from under. The number one way to do this is to start a cash savings soon. That never happens to you. Step three, save for retirement. I'm going to get a little preachy here. The reason I was like, I want to learn about money. I want to help a lot of people figure out how money works. Then I started a tax firm. The reason I did that is because taxes is a great gateway drug to actual wealth building. Because all of the habits that make you rich over a lifetime are also a good way to save money on taxes. The government wants you to be wealthy because it only taxes the wealthiest individuals in the US. In the United States, 90% of our taxes is paid by That's only 10% of the population. Wild, but that's just the way that it works with the different tax brackets. Similarly, if you have a lot of money, then the government doesn't have to pay for welfare, for health care, for any of these things that you get credit for.

[00:14:16.010] - Katherine Pomerantz
The government wants you to be as rich and as happy as possible so you don't become their problem. Now, whether or not this is effective, I'm not here to say. I'm just here to teach you how to play the game. We want to save for retirement because by saving for In our own retirement, the government rewards us by giving us money off of our taxes. As you are starting your blog, you are uniquely in a special position and that you can open up self-employment retirement accounts because they have higher contribution limits than you just being an employee. These are things like a SEP IRA, a SEP IRA, S-E-P-I-R-A, or a Solo 401(k). You can contribute up to $69,000 a year into one of these accounts as opposed to just $23,000 into a regular 401k or $7,000 into a regular IRA. As you grow your income, if you don't want to pay taxes on any of it, fill these retirement accounts. But I'll get to that in a little bit. For now, just start. Just get started and start the habit of, I am saving money on taxes and spending some of my money aside for myself.

[00:15:20.930] - Katherine Pomerantz
You also, as a self-employed person, have until April 15th to fill up every year, not just the end of the calendar year, like with your employer account. So you have even more to keep maxing out for longer, which is just the [inaudible]. There's been a lot of jargon in the first three steps. Anything I should slow down and ask questions or clarify, Liz?

[00:15:42.270] - Liz Stapleton, Host
A couple of things. Okay. First of all, I did not know you could stash that much in a solo 401(k). So there's a lot of different kinds of IRAs, and I know you mentioned a SEP IRA, but there's Roth IRAs, there's non-Roth. Can you just distinguish that one and how it... Because there's so many IRAs. I feel like it's- So many IRAs, yeah. It can be very overwhelming if you don't have a little There's a little bit of knowledge on that.

[00:16:16.320] - Katherine Pomerantz
That's such a good point. Absolutely. There are three types of IRAs that are important for what we're talking about here. There is a traditional IRA, the original, the OG. This is a $7,000 contribution limit right now. You could have a 401(k) at work and still use an IRA. If you have a blog and you could stash aside a little bit of money, that might be a great way to go because any money you put away at a traditional IRA is tax-free. It goes in and you don't pay taxes on it, and then it will grow as it is invested in the IRA. Is that a good quick explanation? Because we can talk also about investing in what that means. We can go.

[00:16:59.340] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Yeah, no, we won't go that deep into it. Correct me if I'm wrong, IRA stands for Individual Retirement Account.

[00:17:05.670] - Katherine Pomerantz
It does. Yes, that's true. It is an acronym, IRA. There is also a Roth IRA. A Roth IRA is different from a traditional IRA, and that money goes in after you pay taxes on it. If I made a dollar, I can deposit 70 cents of it because 30 cents will go to taxes, for example. Then the money as it is in the Roth IRA grows tax-free, and I don't pay taxes when I withdraw the money. In a traditional IRA, I don't pay taxes upfront, but when I'm ready to retire, when I'm ready to use that money, I will pay taxes as I withdraw it. Roth IRAs are a good strategy if you are young or if you know that right now you're in a low-income bracket but are going to have a high-income bracket. My students, especially my med students or my legal students, you will make no money as a resident, but you will have a high salary for the rest of your career. That's a great time to take advantage of a Roth IRA. For my self-employed people, and if you are running a blog and you are wanting to make money off that blog, you are self-employed, you have to balance out self-employment tax and income tax.

[00:18:21.000] - Katherine Pomerantz
You are going to be in the highest tax bracket of pretty much any taxpayer, even if your income isn't that big When I'm talking about saving for retirement, almost without exception, it's a good time for you to use a traditional IRA or a tax advantage saving account in that way. Roths are good in the years you lose money in your business because your income is negative, so it's a good time to start filling in my Roth. I'm paying low taxes this year because my income is down. That's great. That's when we could take advantage of it. But almost without exception, for my self-employed people here, we want to be looking at tax a free retirement. A SEP IRA is exactly the same as a traditional IRA. They are just as easy to open. You can do them with almost the same, all the same robo advisors. You can do them with like 500 bucks in five minutes nowadays. Wealthfront, Betterment, any of the big investing firms, you can open one. The advantage there is that instead of maxing out at $7,000, it maxes out at 18%, well, it's 25% of your profit in your blog, which on average is 18% of what you actually make because as you put into a step, it's tax-free, so it brings it down.

[00:19:34.290] - Katherine Pomerantz
So it isn't the full 25. It's a better estimate is 18%. If you're making a couple of $100,000, you would be able to reach that maximum $69,000 limit. Because they're so easy to use and because you can start small, I'd say go for it and set up a SEP IRA right away, especially if you're serious about building up this blog for yourself, because then as your income scales, your limit scales, and you can just keep backing it every year and you're already in the habit of it, and that's great. But if you don't want to get in the weeds, you're not sure about the blog, just open up a traditional IRA and get started there. Helpful?

[00:20:09.290] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Yes. Thank you for clarifying that.

[00:20:11.790] - Katherine Pomerantz
Yeah, absolutely. We'll throw the solo 401k in in just a minute because that's even better for other reasons. But we're not there yet. We're at the simple stuff. After that, hire a tax preparer. At that stage, the next best thing you can do for your tax strategy is to get somebody like me who's going to be proactively really giving you advice about your exact situation. Because when you add in kids and mortgages and your blog income scales up, there are other things that you might want to start playing with. It's just going to be helpful to have somebody who can keep you up to date. Because the I was going to curse, but I'm not going to curse. The unfortunate thing about the tax code is it changes every year. Sometimes it changes in major ways because the president changes changes, the Congress changes, the administration changes, and they just enact an entirely new tax code. You want somebody in your corner who's going to memorize all those rules for you because if you had all of the knowledge you need to do all the steps really, really well, you'd be running my business, not a blog.

[00:21:17.270] - Katherine Pomerantz
I don't have a blog, you guys, because the blog is a lot of work. I am busy studying taxes to support my bloggers, not to be a blogger. Let's stay in our lane and see where we enjoy staying. I like taxes a lot more than I like to write, so blogging is not for me. I think that one's pretty straightforward. Becoming an S-corp is the good next step. As you start making in the upper five figures for your blogging income, and I'm not talking just revenue, I'm talking revenue minus expenses, although luckily blogs are not that much expenses in them. You start making $50,000, $100,000, it's time to I start thinking about being an S Corp. I have a tax preparer ahead of the S Corp because an S Corp is a type of business entity that has amazing tax advantages if you run them right, and they have extra compliance to make sure that you're not, making away from paying all that income tax that the IRS wants you to pay. Is it the S Corp strategy, Liz? Yeah.

[00:22:27.990] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Because there's a difference between, registering with the state as an S Corp versus registering as a different business entity, and then I believe you can opt to be taxed as an S Corp. Is that correct?

[00:22:39.600] - Katherine Pomerantz
Okay, so that's a great question. An S Corp actually is only a taxable entity. You're A business entity is filed through the state. If you open up a blog, put up some affiliate links, and start making $400 a year, you are a sole proprietor just automatically. You don't need business license, you don't need to be registered. Some states might have different laws about that, but you can just collect money. Then federally, the IRS is like, You're just automatically a sole proprietor. You owe me self-employment taxes on that $400 plus income, whatever. You want to start taking yourself more seriously. You want more legal protection, you go to the state and you register. You can sign up for a DBA, which is just a doing business as and just register the name. You're still a sole proprietor. You can also set up an LLC is a common one. You're a limited liability company for other types of business entities. You could say a partnership or whatever. Well, let's just focus on what- I just wanted to distinguish what you're registered as an entity with the Secretary of State is not necessarily the same as how you're choosing to be taxed.

[00:23:44.790] - Katherine Pomerantz
Yes. An LLC is a very good entity as a business entity because it gives you some legal protection and it allows you to elect a tax entity. Now, automatically, you'll just say a sole proprietor if you do nothing. But when you're ready, when your income is scaled up and you're ready to start saving more money on taxes, you can elect to get tax as an S-Corp. An S-Corp is not a business entity. You're not registered with a state anywhere as an S-Corp. You are registered with the IRS because it's your tax entity. Does that make sense?

[00:24:18.230] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Yes. Do you need... Okay, so this might be going further than you would normally. An EIN is the business equivalent of a social security number. If you choose to change tax entities, like from Sole proprietor to S Corp, do you have to get a new EIN or does that carry over?

[00:24:35.390] - Katherine Pomerantz
No, you can carry over the EIN because it's still the same business entity. So you just need to update with the IRS. There's a separate form just to fill out, but the EIN carries over for you. You actually don't need an EIN to be an S Corp, but you do need an EIN to open a business bank account. I didn't put EIN on here somewhere because it's not really a strategy, but it's a really good advice.

[00:24:58.640] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Sure. Guys, it's free. It takes 15 minutes.

[00:25:01.940] - Katherine Pomerantz
Yeah. The advantage of that is it allows you to not use your social security number everywhere. If you have to go put out a W-9 or fill out legal forms for your business or tax forms for your business, you're not putting out your personal social Social Security number. You're using an employer identification number, but it's a business social security number, basically. See, Liz, this is why I have you on an interview. You got to ask these questions, right?

[00:25:28.600] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Yeah, that's what I'm here for.

[00:25:30.150] - Katherine Pomerantz
An S Corp pays you a bunch of tax money, which we haven't even gone into the details of how and why that works. But the IRS knows that an S-corp save you a lot of money. There's also a lot of rules about you have to have a reasonable wage. You have to pay yourself wages. You have to run payroll for the first time. Then you have to fill out a totally separate business tax form for the first time. I kid you not. We specialize in S-corps because I specialize in people like this who want to run a blog or make content or be an expert or run a small business, lean and maintain high profits, wonderful freedom-driven lifestyle. That's what we're all trying to do here. S-corps is such a good strategy for that. But the IRS knows you're only electing an S-corps to get around paying taxes. You have to follow a bunch of rules. I kid you not, Liz, I specialize in S Corps. I onboard a lot of them. I'm now repeating myself. But Over 50% of the people who come to me as new clients, we refile because they haven't been doing them right, and they're leaving themselves liable for just mistakes, or they're not getting the tax advantages they think they were getting because they weren't doing it right.

[00:26:43.750] - Katherine Pomerantz
That's why tax preparators before this, because if you want to be an expert, that's fantastic. At least get somebody to help you set it up right and teach you how to run it. Also, while you wait until step five, be making some serious money before you go through all this extra admin headache. Otherwise, I don't think it's worth it, but that's my personal. Okay. Make sense there? Any way you want to follow up?

[00:27:05.650] - Liz Stapleton, Host
No, that's great.

[00:27:06.800] - Katherine Pomerantz
Yeah. Anyone who's watching, if you do have more questions, I could literally deep dive on any one of these things for hours. So please ask me to follow up. I'd be thrilled to help you with it. So let's keep going. Save even more for retirement. Circling back around. At step three, if you're already maxing out to $70,000, it was $69,000 a year. Fantastic. I'm so proud of you. You're probably not. Before we get to any other types of strategies, maxing out retirement savings is the number one tax strategy for every person in every type of job at every income level. If you're not doing this first, do this first. Is let's max out your retirement and get as much put away as possible. It is the best way to grow because that money gets invested and it will grow and grow and grow and grow and you're still getting tax advantages. There is nothing else There's a lot of things in the entire tax or financial system that does this well, with some exceptions for health insurance and health savings accounts, but that's not really related specifically to how you're running your blog. We can get to it.

[00:28:14.050] - Katherine Pomerantz
This also is a good It's a good time to start looking at your solo 401(k) versus a SEP IRA. Certain types of retirement contributions from your business are going to be more tax-advantaged. Some of those are going away in 2025 unless the IRS renews some things, though, or Congress renews some things. I'm not going to get in the weeds about that. We'll see how 2025 shakes out, and then you can all follow up with me, I guess. After this, then we get to the bonus types of tax products or tax-advantaged financial products that people don't really know about. So stabilize your financial foundation with other tax-advantaged things like insurance. So insurance is often a tax deduction, and insurance protects your cash flow. So all of this money that you've been stashing away in your retirement account because you've been following the list I've been giving you, all that money is protected and can actually stay invested and tax-advantaged in a retirement account because you've got insurance to cover emergencies. That's what health insurance is for. Health insurance does not take care of you. Health insurance protects you from bankruptcy. In the Invent, you get cancer and it costs millions of dollars to treat you.

[00:29:26.190] - Katherine Pomerantz
That is the only reason to have health insurance. Related to that are other types of insurance that you may want as a business owner. Life insurance. Same thing. If I die, I want to help give my family the income that I would have earned for them. That's what life insurance is for. Short and long term disability insurance. If I am running a blog full-time and I'm writing full-time, but I get in a car accident and break my shoulder and can't type for eight weeks, well, does your income just dry up? What happens? I can't meet all these speaking engagements. I have books. I can't deliver on these products I thought I could do. Disability insurance can step in and continue paying your paycheck, even though all these income streams have dried up. Really important for business owners and something very few of them set up for themselves. We also have business insurance, liability insurance, different things like that that you can put in place. This is also when you can start looking at education savings, like through a 529 plan. If you've got kids or if you want to put yourself back into grad school someday, maybe you want to start setting aside tax advantage or money with a tax savings into a special education account to pay for that.

[00:30:32.970] - Katherine Pomerantz
This is also because you are set up as an S Corp, potentially, when you can start looking at employee benefits through your blog. You work for your blog, you're an employee of your blog and an owner of your blog. There's all sorts of things that you can That's a fun employee benefits that also give you tax advantages, like a dependent care FSA. Again, if you've got kids and you're paying for childcare or summer camp or after-school program, that might be useful. Wellness plans. Wellness plans are in addition to helping you get to You're going to need to pay for health insurance, how you could pay for gym memberships or therapy or acupuncture and things like that. Education reimbursements, not just for saving for tuition, but paying off student loans can be an employee benefit. Then at this level, you're going to want a tax professional because there are different roles depending on the number of employees and if you are considered a highly compensated individual, what you can take as employee benefits, which is FYI, you're going to need to ask somebody about setting it up. But Once it's set up, you just have to file a little couple of extra pieces of paper a year and you get money to yourself tax-free, which is fabulous.

[00:31:40.430] - Katherine Pomerantz
This is where we start to stabilize that financial foundation. We protect your cash flow with insurance products. We help you set up extra savings for different types of jobs for your money. This is where this stuff comes in. Again, lots of jargon in this step, Liz. You with me?

[00:31:54.860] - Liz Stapleton, Host
No, I think we're good.

[00:31:56.090] - Katherine Pomerantz
Okay, cool. Put your kids on payroll. This is one that you may or may not have heard about, but I know, I know, because I work with the bloggers to make lots of money, that this is something that we end up talking about. Like, Oh, yeah, I put my husband on payroll. Oh, yeah, I put my kids on payroll. This is a really good way to reduce your business income, to reduce your business taxes, but keep money in the family. Bonus point, if you take the money you pay your kids and you invest it into an IRA or a 529 plan for education savings, because then you are doublely not paying taxes on it, which is just the best situation. But you could just pay your kids the cash, too, for various reasons. Again, you'll want to make sure you set this up right. There are some legal things that you need to cross your t's, dot your i's about to do this. This is also... A lot of people ask me about this one before they really need it or they're ready for it, because notice this is number 8 of 10. The first seven is going to do more for your lifelong wealth building and your tax savings, and it's less complicated.

[00:33:03.020] - Katherine Pomerantz
I think this is a beautiful strategy. I do this several times a year for clients, but let's get to it when we get to it. Okay? Makes sense. Or do you want me to go into your details of how that works?

[00:33:14.090] - Liz Stapleton, Host
No, I think that's okay. Because at that point, if they really need the details, they should hopefully be working with someone like you.

[00:33:20.730] - Katherine Pomerantz
Exactly. Like I said, there's some legal things you got to put in place to make sure you did it right, and it holds up the scrutiny. But then once it's in place, it's like, so... I did this for a client once, and we took... Because she had four kids, we reduced her taxable income by over 40 grand every year for the next 10 years. It's amazing. It's just a cool loophole that the IRS has made. It's not even a loophole. It's a rule that they did to benefit the small business owners, which are so many of them are family-run companies. Let's know the rules and let's use the rules that are built to help us. Again, as I said, at the very top of this, 90% of the taxes are paid by 10% of the population, and small business owners are in the highest tax bracket because of business taxes and self-employment taxes and payroll taxes and all the things that you pay. You're a big tax payer to take advantage of the breaks that they give you to help. The IRS knows that, but they also know they want you to pay yourself well, live well, so give you some things that you can reduce.

[00:34:22.230] - Katherine Pomerantz
Okay, almost done. Nine, give to charity. At this point, hopefully you're making good money. Let's spread that money around. Spread that wealth around. Let's find ways to invest back in your community. Find ways to invest where you want to see. That's a tax deduction. This is often overlooked as ways to reduce taxes and feel like your money is being put to work for you. It doesn't just have to be in your business. It doesn't just have to be in a savings account. We can give it to other people to get it to work, and you can take a tax deduction for it. Love this one. Okay, final one, number 10, make an estate plan. Look at all the work you just did in this flowchart. Look at all the money you will have saved up in a retirement account. You are now running a blog. You've probably been running it for a year or two and you're making good money. You now have a business that is an asset that is going to that's something you could sell. What's your exit strategy for this blog? It's something you don't want to keep running it. How do you want to divvy up all of this money that's invested in a retirement account in case it outlives you?

[00:35:27.570] - Katherine Pomerantz
You've been giving to charity. Do you want that to continue? Do you You have all of these different ways that you could pass that money on to other people or, again, to exit your business and still make money on it. This is where estate planning and exit planning and all the legal details, this is where this starts to come in. Things to pay attention to at this level. If you're at this level, Roth IRAs come back into play and maybe turning from rolling over from a traditional back into a Roth because then you pay the taxes on it, not your heirs. Life insurance, Life insurance payout, not taxable to your heirs. Gift taxes are important. So maybe you start giving money away under that gift tax threshold early before you die. Maybe you want to see it, get to put to see it before you die. Maybe you want to see it, get to see it before you die. Maybe you want to see it, get to see Trust. There's lots of... I'm not even going to touch Trust because that's not my specialty. But there's a lot of stuff you can do through Trust to help make sure the money goes where you want it to do.

[00:36:25.180] - Katherine Pomerantz
And then, like I said, with exit planning, your business assets and your IP, your intellectual property. Bloggers, especially, who have all of this content, this brand, these funnels, these systems. These are things people will pay for. Even if you're only making a few hundred thousand with it, that's money somebody else may want to take and run with. Do you have that stuff trademarked? Do you have those systems built, those SOPs in place? Have you trained somebody to run it for you? Are you ready to sell it and then start the next blog or start the next self-employed project or travel for a while until you find out what you want to do next? That's where we can start looking at these things here. I mentioned that even as a beginner, it's good to know this flow because of this number 10. When you begin with the end in mind and you can work backwards, you can start thinking about what you're Thinking about, Oh, this could be part of my business asset someday. This could be part of my exit plan someday. Making sure I'm saving for retirement and knowing as I make money, I need to be setting stuff aside and planning on this and knowing I need to start hiring this help to make sure that I actually have the experience I want to have, knowing what that flow looks like means you're going to already be planning and assimilating information and finding the right people.

[00:37:42.350] - Katherine Pomerantz
When the time has come to pull the trigger, it feels easy. It feels like, yes, this is natural. I know it's coming. I've thought about it. I put the pieces in place. My foundation was there from the get-go. I am ready to go. Those are my 10 steps. At this point, we jump to the Q&A. Liz, what's can I share? What do we need to go into more detail about?

[00:38:03.920] - Liz Stapleton, Host
What I'm wondering is if you have an example money map, because I feel like that's the most abstract of all the steps you shared. If there's an example of one that people would look at and be like, Oh, that's what she means by money map. Yes.

[00:38:20.940] - Katherine Pomerantz
In the resources that I gave as part of the Speaker, I gave my tax worksheet. Actually, because this is recorded, do you want me to pull it up and show? Sure. Yeah. Okay. Let me just pull it up and show you guys real fast. Because I gave you want to see one of my money maps, and you just have it.

[00:38:49.040] - Liz Stapleton, Host
And the links guys will be included on this page.

[00:38:51.850] - Katherine Pomerantz
So this is my easy tax worksheet. I'm going to share my screen now. All you have to do is drop your email and you'll get this link and you can make a copy yourself. But here on the business PnL is a great example of a money map. And I have a little video. I have here on this thing a little walkthrough video that explains how to use this thing. But I'm just going to scroll down and focus on, okay, great, here's all my income, here's all my expenses. Oh, look, exactly what Katherine talked about of mapping out what I want to do. Here's all the money I made this month on my blog. Here's what I'm going to save for taxes. Here's what I'll invest back into my blog. Here's what I'm going to put into retirement. Again, I'm going to get on my high horse about that one for you all. Here's what's left over to pay myself. This is something you can customize for yourself. I'm giving you this template to help organize. I mean, you've got other organizational things here. Again, I got a video explanation for it, so I won't waste your...

[00:39:42.990] - Katherine Pomerantz
I won't double do it here. But this is what I mean when I talk about money mapping is I've mindfully made a plan. I know I'm going to follow all the 10 steps Katherine gave me. I know I'm going to want to set aside cash savings into my blog. That was step two. I know I'm going to want to start saving for retirement. That was step three and step six. Now, I'm going to map it out every month how I divide up that cash, and I know I'm going to get as much tax savings as possible, as much lifelong wealth building as possible. It feels so organized and feels so good.

[00:40:15.110] - Liz Stapleton, Host
No, I love this. I like it a lot. I'm probably going to make copy myself.

[00:40:20.110] - Katherine Pomerantz
Please do. It's one of my coaching templates. I use it in my accounting firm. We give it to real clients. These are the real things we do to like, Hey, organize it this way because it makes preparing your tax forms as easy as possible. So my gift to everybody, I would love for you all to win. We're from the states. Yes.

[00:40:37.220] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Definitely go grab that, you guys. Katherine, thank you so much for coming back. I really appreciate it. Anything else you want to say?

[00:40:44.970] - Katherine Pomerantz
Not at all. Like I said, I'll be in Facebook. My contact info is going to be shared. You grab the text worksheet. Please, genuinely, if you have follow-up questions, do not hesitate to reach out with me. I think a lot of times people are afraid to talk to speakers. But because I approach this on that money story method, I know, I know. Because I've helped thousands of people with this at this point. It only works if we can really customize it to what you want, to your blog, to your life, to your goals. So truly, It's okay to ask me a question if that gets you started in the right direction. I would really like to support you guys in that. I really hope that you keep these 10 flowcharts for lifelong tax building. Truly, that's all I want for today. So thank you, Liz, for letting me get to do that and share that.

[00:41:31.650] - Liz Stapleton, Host
You're very welcome, guys. Go check her out.
