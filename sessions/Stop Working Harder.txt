Welcome to Stop Working Harder. I am so excited that you are here at this session because this is such an important message and skill to learn. But before we get started, I wanted to take a moment to introduce myself to you. Hello. I'm Rebekah Lara.

[00:00:32.740] - Rebakah
I am the owner of Rebekah Lara Virtual Solutions, where I am a productivity coach, an online business manager, and Asana certified pro, which if you're not familiar with Asana, it's a digital project management tool that has saved my sanity. And I just couldn't recommend it more highly. I'm also the creator of the course Save Your Sanity with Asana, which is why I say that where I teach other people how to save their sanity because running an online business can be challenging, especially when you're a mom like me.

[00:01:09.730] - Rebakah
And we are not only running an online business but also raising a family, raising our children. And I'm the mother of three young ladies. They are the light of my life, and they also come with their own unique special needs.

[00:01:26.920] - Rebakah
All three of them have complex and chronic medical conditions and mental health issues. And my oldest daughter is a survivor of multiple organ failure. And I only share that with you because I want you to know that I have been in the trenches like literally at our lowest moment in our family. And slowly over the past three and a half years or so, I have climbed out of that and I am happy to report that my daughter has been recovering and is doing so much better. It is still a process.

[00:02:06.500] - Rebakah
She is still not 100%, and a lot of what I do is teach women and other parents how to fulfill their business dreams, their goals, and their businesses while also dealing with life's challenges.

[00:02:24.300] - Rebakah
So, you might not have the same challenges as I do with my daughter and all of their special needs. But I'm sure you have something that you can relate to, something that has gotten in the way. And so that is my passion. That is who I am. And I am happy to share some of the things I've learned sometimes the hard way along this journey.

[00:02:49.050] - Rebakah
So, I would love for you to start by asking yourself, why do you feel like you need to work hard? So, it could possibly be some of these reasons? Is it to feel worthy? Is it to be liked, liked by others, liked by your family, your spouse, your partner, your community, your colleagues? Is it to feel valuable? Sometimes I hear that we don't feel valuable unless we're doing something or helping someone else. Or is it to make more money?

[00:03:29.330] - Rebakah
This is a common belief. I hear a lot as well. And in order to make more money and support ourselves and support our families, we need to be working harder to do that. But I challenge you to really stop and think about this. How does this make you feel?

[00:03:49.890] - Rebakah
I'm also wondering, how is it influencing your mood and your desire to work on your business? A lot of times I hear my clients tell me that it makes them not want to work on their business. They don't feel in quotes motivated to work on their business when they're feeling like they need to be working hard to be successful. That doesn't align with being motivated and wanting to wake up each day working on your blog, working on your business

[00:04:22.530] - Rebakah
Is it giving you energy or is it draining your energy? Please tell us in the chat box. It's really important to tune into yourself and figure out how you're feeling and how it's affecting your actions. Because a lot of times if we're feeling this way, we're feeling unmotivated and stressed and overwhelmed. It's not giving us the energy that we need or desire to work on our business or any part of our lives. Right? So, take a quick moment.

[00:04:55.300] - Rebakah
Tell us how you're feeling or what thoughts you're having about working harder in your business. The good news and the truth is that you don't have to work harder to be successful and make more money. Working longer, working harder and staying busier is not going to get you results faster. And I know that can seem counterintuitive. However, working longer, working harder and staying busier is just in my opinion, and in my experience going to lead to burnout, which is not going to get you the results that you want faster.

[00:05:32.190] - Rebakah
Instead focusing on the top 20% will.

[00:05:37.170] - Rebakah
And if you're not familiar with that term or that strategy, I want to introduce you to the Pareto principle. It's also known as the 80/20 rule. This principle guides all of my decisions to be honest every day now. Especially as a mom of three girls who have special needs and medical challenges, I don't have time to do everything. And this principle has taught me that the top 20% of my tasks will actually account for 80% of my results.

[00:06:14.550] - Rebakah
So let me say that again, the top 20% of your tasks will actually account for 80% of your results. So, as a business owner, as a blogger, you can sigh a big breath of relief that you don't have to actually do everything. You don't have to feel like you just need to keep turning out content and posts and logos and branding and all these things. Because really, only the top 20% of your tasks, meaning the things you do in your day during your week are going to be responsible for most of your results in your business and in your blog. 

[00:07:04.240] - Rebakah
So that also means that 20% of your products, your paid offers will also account for 80% of your profits. So, if you know this, you can start focusing in and prioritizing those tasks and those products and those offers that are going to get you the most results and the most profit in your business while also not leading to stress, overwhelm, fatigue, and burnout.

[00:07:41.010] - Rebakah
Yet unfortunately, most people, including myself, I've been here too and still find myself falling into this trap. Sometimes most people avoid the 20% because those tasks are outside of their comfort zone, meaning they're the biggest tasks. They're the scariest. They're new. Perhaps they involve you learning a new skill or a new tool in order to do it.

[00:08:12.050] - Rebakah
And so a lot of times people will avoid doing those tasks, even though they're going to be the tasks and the projects that lead you to the results you desire because they are stopped by fear and overwhelm and the unknown. I, however, coach my clients on how to overcome those fears and how to overcome these thoughts and how to really focus on the top 20%, and we call that learning to eat that frog or eat your frog. There is a saying by Mark Twain. He actually has a quote about this, and I want to share that with you because then it will make more sense.

[00:08:59.880] - Rebakah
So, Mark Tracy once said, Eat a live frog first thing in the morning and nothing worse will happen to you the rest of the day, which that might seem like random.

[00:09:12.090] - Rebakah
Why am I sharing this with you? Well, there's this book that you can see here by Brian Tracy called Eat That Frog. And it's a really fantastic book about productivity and how to stop procrastinating and get more done in less time, which is my mission. And I love this book because it's short and it contains 21 really short chapters like three to four pages long. They give you practical actionable tips to learn to eat your frog. And so, from the perspective of Brian Tracy, the author, he is saying that sometimes those tasks that are in the top 20% that feel intimidating or overwhelming or make you a little bit scared and step outside of your comfort zone.

[00:10:03.610] - Rebakah
Those are your frogs, right? Because you know that they are the things that you need to do and that will move your business forward and get you those results that you desire. However, they're the things you don't really feel like doing or afraid to do. They are your frogs. So, what Mark Tracy is saying is if you have to eat a live frog, which sounds horrible, right?

[00:10:29.090] - Rebakah
Just like some of our business tasks feel like do it first thing in the morning, meaning the first thing you do in the day, and then you know that the rest of the day nothing worse is going to happen. You've already gotten that out of your way. And so, it also teaches you that to focus and prioritize and put those tasks first in your day because they are the most important and giving your energy to those top 20% will get you the results you desire. You do it first and you get it done even when it's scary.

[00:11:10.850] - Rebakah
But getting it done first you've now made more progress than if you focused on the rest of the stuff in your business that won't get you the results you desire.

[00:11:25.110] - Rebakah
Another mentor and business coach that I look to at times is James Wedmore. And he had a series of podcast episodes that talked about time and productivity and time management, and he also teaches a similar concept. So, if you're interested in learning more, you could check out some of his podcast because he talks about the top 5% in a very similar way. Same idea. One of his quotes or his mantras is the less you do, the more you will make. Meaning if you focus on that top 5%, the more money you're going to make by putting yourself out there doing those more important, sometimes scary things.

[00:12:13.470] - Rebakah
It's going to move your business forward faster, and ultimately, you're going to not work as hard because you're going to be doing less work while making more impact. So, I want to remind you also that every single thing we do is a choice. Every single thing you do in your business is a choice. And why does that matter? Because sometimes we need to prioritize and make choices about where we're going to spend our energy.

[00:12:48.510] - Rebakah
We need to accept the fact that we can't do everything. There's always a million things to do, but we need to make choices that are going to serve our business and our blog to give us the results that we want. And so, what this boils down to a lot of times is thinking about our Shoulds versus our Wants. As I mentioned, we often feel like we have to do all the things, and I mean both in our business and in our personal lives. We feel like we have to work hard and give value by doing everything for everyone.

[00:13:27.390] - Rebakah
And oftentimes that leaves very little for ourselves. Instead, stop thinking about what you should be doing, so eliminate the shoulds in your life. I should be doing this. I should be doing more. I should be working harder.

[00:13:44.950] - Rebakah
I should be helping my friend. I should be helping the school. I should be volunteering. There's so many things that we tell ourselves we should be doing, and I am urging you to stop shoulding on yourself. That is a phrase I heard from someone else.

[00:14:02.650] - Rebakah
I can't take credit, but it stuck with me, and I really remind myself of that often. Stop shoulding on myself. It's not helpful because sure, we could be doing so many things, but we don't have to. We have a choice and we can prioritize and instead focus on our wants. I want to grow my business.

[00:14:28.540] - Rebakah
I want to help my friend, even when it comes to cooking dinner for your family. Instead of saying I should be cooking a healthy dinner tonight, focus instead on the feeling of wanting to do that because when you want to do something, it energizes you. It motivates you from a deeper place and not laden with guilt, right, about what you should be doing. So, make a choice about where you want to spend your time, what you want to prioritize, both in your blogging world, in your business and in your personal life.

[00:15:10.450] - Rebakah
And like I said, I challenge you to make a choice today. Ask yourself, is there something I really need to do, or do I want to do it. Right? So, every task that comes your way, every request that comes your way, whether it's from your business, from your clients, from your colleagues, from the outside world, your community, ask yourself this filter every time. Is this something I really need to do? Or is it something I want to do?

[00:15:43.450] - Rebakah
When we're thinking about our blogging world, we might be feeling like we need to post three times a week or we need to be posting on social media on all the platforms. Okay, but is it really something you need to do? Is it going to help grow your business, or is it something you want to do? Maybe you only want to post on Instagram, but you feel like you need to also post on Facebook and Twitter? Ask yourself, is that true?

[00:16:18.490] - Rebakah
A lot of times when we prioritize and we focus on things that are most important that are going to get us the best results, we can learn to stop working harder and instead start focusing on what matters most. A lot of times too, we don't have a ton of time to work on our blog or our business. If you are someone like me who's juggling family life and other client work or maybe a nine to five job and you're blogging on the side and hopes to grow it into a full time business, we tell ourselves that we don't have time.

[00:16:59.170] - Rebakah
But instead of telling yourself these unhelpful thoughts, ask yourself, how can I make my blog happen or growth in my blog or business happen? Even if I only have 2 hours per day, or even if I only have 1 hour per day or 3 hours per week. Whatever your situation may be, start making a choice about how you can flip what you're needing to do versus what you're wanting to do. So that you can start prioritizing and making time for what's most important in your life and in your business.

[00:17:36.430] - Rebakah
And so some of the key beliefs to try out. These are some that have worked for me or my clients and maybe some of them will resonate with you. Instead of telling ourselves those unhelpful thoughts about I don't have time or I have to do everything and I have to keep working harder in order to be successful. Let's flip it and try telling yourself instead. I don't have to do everything for everyone.

[00:18:03.370] - Rebakah
I don't have to be busy to be worthy. I deserve to be taken care of too. This is one of my favorites, the most important things will get done. Notice I didn't say everything will get done. No, the most important things will get done.

[00:18:22.590] - Rebakah
The top 20%, everything that needs to get done will get done or everything I want to get done will get done. And finally, that one from James Wedmore again, is the less I do, the more I make. So, as we wrap up, I want to give you this guide to working less with an action plan, if you will, so that you know the next steps to take in order to get those results that you desire. Right now, your first step would be to become aware of those limiting thoughts and beliefs so that you can stop telling yourself disempowering stories, the Shoulds versus the Wants.

[00:19:06.300] - Rebakah
Right?

[00:19:07.120] - Rebakah
So, some ways that you can do that is to just Journal. If you like to Journal and write, just become aware of those thoughts by writing down, what is going through my mind right now? Why do I feel that I need to work harder? Ask yourself some of those questions from the beginning of this presentation. That's step one.

[00:19:28.680] - Rebakah
Then in the next 30 days, question those and investigate those limiting beliefs. Identify your Shoulds versus your Wants, so you could do that by creating lists. What do I feel like I should be doing and then make a column that is, what do I actually want to be doing? And you can do that for your business, for your blog, for your personal life. That is the first step.

[00:19:52.070] - Rebakah
And a lot of what I teach my clients is like identifying where you're spending your time currently and where you'd rather be spending your time, those are wants. And how to get from where you are now to your wants and your priorities. So, start questioning those. Start investigating them and identifying your wants both in your business, in your blog and in your personal life. And then the next step over the next day, 31 to 60 days, would be to make a new belief plan by rewriting your limiting beliefs into empowering, encouraging beliefs, and some of those I just gave you on the previous screen.

[00:20:35.770] - Rebakah
So, like I said, if those resonate with you, great, try practicing those by telling them to yourself, by writing it in your Journal, even if it's just one or two.

[00:20:46.610] - Rebakah
Sometimes that can really start to change the way we think. So that we're not working as hard because we start to believe that we don't have to. We don't have to work harder to be worthy. And then finally, over the next 61 to 90 days, I would try out these new thoughts and beliefs, start practicing them and putting them into action by making different choices and taking different actions. So, I have found that once I started truly believing those thoughts that I didn't have to do everything or I don't have to work hard to be successful.

[00:21:22.990] - Rebakah
Then I was able to make different choices about where I was spending my time in my business. I can make different choices for my blogging career and start to take different actions that would get me faster results without working harder. And if you're ready to combine this positive mindset and these new beliefs with actionable strategies, I would love to invite you to my free on demand workshop called How to Easily Plan Your Week using Asana. So, this is the next natural step in this action plan. Once we start to shift the way we're thinking and we finally believe and practice believing it might take a little while, let me just put that out there.

[00:22:11.240] - Rebakah
This might not happen overnight, and that's okay. But once we start to believe that we can do less and not have to work as hard, we can then start to plan our week by prioritizing using my strategies and recommendations in the program Asana, which is a digital tool that really makes it easy to organize and plan your business.
