We are good. Hi. So everyone that's joining us, welcome. We have a fantastic lineup of panelists here. I'm going to introduce them by name, and then they'll tell you about themselves. First up, a big warm welcome to all of you. But Sage, let's start with you, Sage Grayson, who is a life editor. Hi.

[00:00:20.550] - Sage Grayson

[00:00:52.490] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Yes, super excited to have you. Let's move on to Heather Richie, who's a freelance writer and a returning blogger Breakthrough Summit speaker. Welcome back.

[00:01:00.630] - Heather Ritchie
Hey, thank you for having me. Hello, everybody. I am a certified content marketing strategist and SEO content writer. I basically help content creators make the whole process of writing content easier. I know that it can be an overwhelming task for many. So this is something that I really try to help people with and love talking about SEO.

[00:01:37.160] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Yes. And then we have such a good group here. And then Amira from A Self Guru, who is an attorney and blogger and always helps us out on the legal side of things. If you want to actually explain a little more.

[00:01:50.260] - Amira Irfan
Absolutely. Well, thank you, first of all, for having me. I'm so excited to be part of this summit for years now, and Liz does such a great job of hosting it. I feel like I know a lot of you guys already. In the blogging space, people know each other, but here's a brief introduction. Again, my name is Amira. I'm the business lawyer, blogger, and coach behind aselfguru.com, where we help entrepreneurs legally protect themselves either by working with me one-on-one or simply downloading my done for your legal templates. Unfortunately, a lot of times what I've noticed in my own experience with blogging is that people tend to neglect the legal side of blogging, and they don't treat it like a business. That's some of the things we're we're going to talk about today. I have seen my own dad, not that he was a blogger, but he was a business owner, and he faced a massive lawsuit for not protecting his business legally from the beginning. After watching my dad losing $90,000, I decided to become a business lawyer so that I could help other entrepreneurs from suffering the same fate. Today, we're going to be talking about a lot of that stuff and how to legally protect yourself as well as treating your blog like a business.

[00:02:57.920] - Amira Irfan
I'm excited to be here.

[00:03:00.590] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Yes, super excited to have you back. And of course, finally, a big warm welcome to Chelsea Clarke, founder of Her Paper Route, who she does all sorts of things, including flipping blogs. I don't know what you want to tell them about yourself because you do so much. But please introduce yourself.

[00:03:14.810] - Chelsea Clarke
Well, thank you so much for having me back at the summit. Again, I'm so happy to be here. And hello, everyone. Yes, my name is Chelsea Clarke. I'm the founder of Her Paper Route. I help content creators make more money and thrive in the creator economy. Specifically, I show people how to monetize their websites and even generate profit to it so that it's worth more so that you can actually sell your website if that's a goal, or you could just keep it and earn from it, keep it in your portfolio. So I also founded a marketplace where you buy and sell online businesses and blogs, and that's called NicheInvestor.

[00:03:50.850] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Nice, I like it. All right, so we are going to start with questions that were submitted. Let me pull them up real quick or completely exit out of the tab. That's good, too. I believe the first question that was submitted is from, I think, Tangi. I apologize if I'm saying your name wrong. But they say, I'm struggling to generate traffic on my site. It's two years old with over 60 articles, do you have any suggestions of strategies that they can implement to get traction on their site?

[00:04:25.530] - Sage Grayson
Oh, I would love to take this one.

[00:04:27.030] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Go for it.

[00:04:28.260] - Sage Grayson
All right. I have Let's see, five tips to help you get more traffic to your site. And these are free tips. So yes, if you have a little bit of money to spend, there are other options for you. And if you can go that route, great. But let's talk really free and easy to get more traffic to your site. So first of all, this is something that I've only recently started doing in the past few months is apply to bundles, summits, podcasts, guest posting. Get yourself out there. Reach out is the biggest thing that I want to I encourage you to do. If you can get yourself in front of other people who have larger audiences, then those audiences will come back to your blog. Always make sure when you're doing a bundle or a summit or a podcast interview, that you're mentioning your freebie or your lead magnet and encouraging people to go back to your website. I also encourage my clients to have a URL or a domain that is short and easy to say, as if you're saying it on the Today show or something. You want to be able to say it quick and easy to get people to come back to your website.

[00:05:30.960] - Sage Grayson
That's number one. It apply to to Bundle, Summit, podcast, guests post where there are larger audiences. Number two is something that I did when I started my business, and I still do it to this day, it's commenting. You might think, wow, that's really old school. Well, I've been blogging for 14 years now. In my first six months of blogging, way back in 2011, I got almost no traffic. I got no sales. I was really, really struggling. My idea was to get in front of the people who were my ideal clients. The best way to do that was to go to their blogs, leave helpful comments proving that I actually read their blog and that I'm trying to create a conversation, and then they would click my name and come back to my blog. I had nothing else to do. I spent eight hours a day commenting on other people's blogs and websites and getting them to come back to mine. So it was around 80 to 100 comments a day. I don't recommend doing that now. I think you've got other things to do. But when I had nothing else to do, and that was my job, I made commenting and actively choosing my audience and getting them to come back.

[00:06:36.270] - Sage Grayson
That was the second thing that I did to get more traffic to my site. Number three, joint ventures. So find another blogger where you share an audience, but you're not necessarily competitors. My audience likes productivity and organizing, so I might go to someone who has a blog about home organizing or home decorate, where we're not in competition, but we share an audience. You can do lots of different kinds of joint ventures. The easy ones that I like is where you come up with some listicle, 10 ways to Blank. One of you takes five and the other of you takes five. Then you say, To get the full list, you got to go check out my friend's blog. Then you can share your audiences with each other. So come up with some joint venture. Number four, really simple, just encourage your readers to share your blog post. Put those buttons at the bottom, make it easy for them to share on Facebook or on other social media platforms. If you are sending your email newsletters, tell them to share the newsletters with their friends and family to get those people to come over to your website.

[00:07:37.570] - Sage Grayson
And then my final tip is share your old blog posts. You've got 60 plus articles already. I have to struggle to get my clients to share their old blog post, but they're like, I can't share that. I wrote that 10 years ago. Is it still relevant? Is it still helpful? Keep sharing those blog posts on social media. Do a roundup in your email newsletters. Bundle them together into a new product. Share those old blog posts to get people to come back to your website. Those are my five tips to get more traffic to your website if you need to keep it budget friendly, cheap, and easy.

[00:08:13.990] - Liz Stapleton, Host
I'm just going to throw... So I know Heather is going to say something about sharing your old blog posts, and I'm going to let you in just a second. But I would also just say, email your list and links to your blog. That's so easy. Okay, Heather, go ahead.

[00:08:28.720] - Heather Ritchie
Yeah, I was going to say, since I do I had such an aversion to it when I started because all of us know how hard it is to balance all the things that you have to do with blogging or just having a website in general. So I did what most people do, and I ignored it, which really did not help me at all, and I'm probably years behind where I could be. So I really suggest I'm going to go the opposite for Sage because those are really good free tips. Those are amazing. But you do at some point need to invest, even if it's in ebooks on keyword research, like Debbie Gartner has some good books out there on on-page SEO, but focusing on on-page SEO and learning how to do keyword research the right way because no matter what you do, if you're trying to rank for the wrong keywords and they're too difficult for your website, then it's not going to happen. There are a lot of resources out there, and you can even use free keyword tools or I use Key Search, which is I think about $11.90 a month or something.

[00:09:32.980] - Heather Ritchie
Really focus on that on-page SEO, like what you can do with your content and make sure that you are sharing and doing those other things, too. Email your list. I feel like we forget some of those simplest things that you do as blogger. I just really, really recommend that SEO is every bit as important as your email list. You want to focus on those two things in the beginning.

[00:09:59.430] - Sage Grayson
Yeah.

[00:10:00.000] - Liz Stapleton, Host
And I'll see, and Amira, whatever you two need to add.

[00:10:04.310] - Chelsea Clarke
I'll just have to say something really quick. I just wanted to add, so the creator who asked this question said they have 60 articles. They've been working for two years. And I want to say that I know how much effort and time that goes into making those 60 articles because been there, done that, still doing it. But the thing is, in the eyes of Google and other search engines, 60 articles is not very much. And Google really needs to be able to rank your site by seeing that it has lots of content. It's ranking for specific keywords around a specific niche. And 60 just doesn't give it that much data to go on. So the more content that you can put out that's high quality, that answers the search intent, which just means that when someone types something into Google, your blog comes up and answers what they're looking for. More content that you can put out like that. Really great. Follow SEO tips, read the free ebooks, read the... Like you say, invest, Heather, in something paid. It's going to pay off for you, but put out more content and utilize Pinterest is free and that can help give your site, your traffic, a boost while you're waiting for the search engines to pick up your site and know what to do with it to rank it.

[00:11:11.600] - Amira Irfan
Absolutely. I'm just going to add, and I agree with every single thing you guys have said because we all work together in different ways. I'm going to share my journey. When I was a new blogger, I honestly started with traffic with guest posting, going back to Sage's point, just posting on websites that had more traffic than my site did, which was very beneficial because then if they have your target audience, you can always guest post. It's free. You just reach out. You also get a backlink, which also helps your domain authority. These are different ways that you are increasing your website strength. Then the second thing I did was focus on Pinterest SEO. Unfortunately, guys, you have to treat your blog, or fortunately, you have to treat your blog like a business. That's one mental, I guess, you call it a mental shift. That you need to have. Don't treat it like a hobby if you are looking to monetize it. I did invest in Pinterest courses, SEO courses, whether I like them or not, that's a different story. But I had to learn these new things. In the end, like what Chelsea said, what Heather is saying, they do pay off because these are skills that you learn once, and then you just keep on using it for years and years.

[00:12:22.740] - Amira Irfan
Until this day, I get most of my traffic from Pinterest. It's absolutely free. Then you also have Google. With the algorithm changes, unfortunately, you have to keep on revising your strategy a little bit. But the key foundation, the stuff that you learn about keyword research, long-tail keywords and things like that will still stay with you for years and years. Now with the AI, it's so much easier to write articles faster. Of course, you need the human touch. You're not going to just take whatever AI spits out and just publish it on your site. You need to be able to review it. But what I'm saying is it becomes a lot easier now than when I first started years ago to generate content. There's a lot of things you can do. And like what Chelsea said, the 60 articles is not sufficient, so you got to give it a little bit more time, but also make sure that it's Pinterest SEO ready, also Google SEO ready, because there is two different things to make sure you got traffic from those two sources.

[00:13:23.670] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Yeah, and like, Pinterest is SEO. People tend to think it's not, but it really is. Pinterest, Google, and YouTube, they're all search engines. So just keeping that in mind.

[00:13:33.670] - Sage Grayson
I love that you mentioned Pinterest. I get 60 % of my traffic from Pinterest. Which I don't know, blows my mind.

[00:13:40.450] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Invest in your education, guys. And that part will never go away. I just look, I spent over $5,000 on courses and things last year. And I've been doing this for almost 10 years. You have to keep investing in that because stuff changes. And it's just part of having a business is making sure.

[00:13:58.820] - Sage Grayson
Who's current Pinterest courses do you recommend?

[00:14:05.030] - Heather Ritchie
Natalie Bardo has a Pinterest course.

[00:14:08.330] - Liz Stapleton, Host
I think she spoke it last year. No, Natalie is awesome. She spoke it last year.

[00:14:11.800] - Heather Ritchie
Carly Campbell has Pinterest strategies, which is really cool because she doesn't use tailwind or anything.

[00:14:19.790] - Liz Stapleton, Host
She's very anti-schedule.

[00:14:20.560] - Heather Ritchie
I did also want to say this is a very unpopular thing, but I teach everybody this, you need to niche down. People do not like hearing that, but it's going to be a lot harder for Google to figure out what you're about. Like Chelsea said, if you have a whole bunch of tips about gardening, raising kids, shopping, it just really confuses Google. So niching down in a lot of these different categories that we're going to talk about, niching down is going to help make your content easier. It's just going to make your life easier in general, and you can establish yourself as an expert.

[00:14:54.550] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Okay. I do want to move on to the next question. I just want to make sure we get through all. So this next one, I want to limit each of you to one. And then if any weren't mentioned afterwards, we'll talk about it. How can you make money blogging? So who wants to start?

[00:15:13.650] - Heather Ritchie
I'll start.

[00:15:14.820] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Oh, Amira said first. Amira, what's one way that you can make money blogging?

[00:15:19.420] - Amira Irfan
So my all-time favorite way of making money blogging is creating my own digital products because it is the easiest, and to me, not to everybody, but I love creating products, digital products, and I love the fact that it's passive. You create it once and then you sell it for years and years. My oldest product has been in the market for over five years. Still my best selling product. I also love the fact that you are in control of your profit. When you have your own product versus affiliate marketing, and I'm not going to get into it because we're limited to one, I feel like you have a lot more control over the profit. You get to dictate the terms, you get to dictate how much you want to price them for, and it's just the fastest and to me, the easiest way to earn passive income blogging.

[00:16:10.600] - Heather Ritchie
 I was going to say? I'm like Amira, I'm a prolific creator. But my second favorite is affiliate marketing. It's something that you really want to drill down into and really work on your messaging. But the sky is the limit with how much you can make in blogging, whether you're with your own products or affiliate marketing. I mean, literally the sky's the limit. Promoting other people's products is my next favorite way.

[00:16:45.600] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Who wants to go next?

[00:16:48.360] - Chelsea Clarke
Oh, sorry. Go ahead.

[00:16:51.110] - Sage Grayson
Oh, yeah. Kind of piggybacking on that. Sponsors. So whether you reach out to specific companies and ask them to sponsor you or whether they reach out to you, being able to talk about other people's products that you believe in and getting paid for that. I get most of my sponsors through my YouTube channel, but then I also share those videos on my blog. Just making sure that those sponsors and those products are in a line with your niche and your audience and that you believe in them. I'm a late adopter, so I say no to almost all of the sponsors who contact me. I'm really glad that they do because I wait a a few months to see, is there any scandal about this sponsor? And I'm really, really glad that I've passed on certain sponsors. But if you believe in them and they're a trustworthy company and they have something to offer your audience, sponsors are a great way to go.

[00:17:44.170] - Chelsea Clarke
I'm going to I'm going to say, first of all, I agree with these three ladies. These are my top revenue streams as well. So you all already took them. But I'm going to say the package that you put it in is actually very important. So for me, it's email marketing. So whether you want to sell digital products, affiliate, get sponsors, or just you have lots of traffic and you want ad revenue, putting everything into your email list, that's going to be where you can make the most sales. Then you can sell anything you want to your audience.

[00:18:09.510] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Yes, I am going to add. Those are my... So sponsors, I don't really do sponsors, but affiliate marketing And digital products, those are my top. There's obviously display ads. I feel like that's what most people think of, which can be lucrative, but you have to have the traffic. That is a really... You're building the traffic if you want to monetize that way. And then I'd say the last way people to monetize their blogs is by offering services, building out a service-based business, which is just a matter of what your goals are. I just wanted to throw those in there. And I will say, if you're looking at how you get started with digital products, Aisha Preece has a presentation, I think it's airing Friday, that is how to get started when you have less than a thousand [people] with digital products. So definitely check that out. Okay, next question. Got too many things open. So the next question we got is from Kim. I think this was going to be really directed to Amira. It says, In addition to privacy policy, et cetera, what legal templates can I use specifically for digital courses and/or services on my site?

[00:19:15.010] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Where do I find them?

[00:19:17.260] - Amira Irfan
Well, yeah, that's definitely my question. First of all, let me just give you the breakdown. You need a privacy policy because it's legally required, no matter what you're doing, whether you're selling digital products or whether you're selling services, either way you need them. The second one I would recommend is called a disclaimer. Disclaimer is needed to limit the legal liability associated with the products that you sell, as well as what you publish on your website so that people don't come after you for the content that you're sharing so freely. The third one that you would need is terms and conditions. Now, there's two different kinds. One is for your website rules, like your website terms and conditions. Then if you are selling digital products or services, then you definitely need terms and conditions because you want to avoid legal disputes, refunds. As a matter of fact, this morning, I got an email from somebody who is about to launch a course, and she's very concerned about chargebacks and refunds and things like that. She was making sure that my template included something about refund policy or not. These are the different things that you want to also keep in mind.

[00:20:25.110] - Amira Irfan
Obviously, you can't avoid chargeback completely, but at least for the refunds, whether you decide to have a refund refund policy or you don't, that's your call. But those are things that you need to put in the terms and conditions and have your customers click to accept them in order to be bound by them. Those are the three that you absolutely should have in place for your website as well as for your products and services. Does that answer the question?

[00:20:47.960] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Yes. I'm just going to add a little bit to it because I've got the legal background as well. I always like to explain terms and conditions as your way of saying, My house, my rules. And your privacy policy is being like, Hey, The information you're giving me, this is what I'm doing with it. That's what that is. And disclaimer is like, Hey, I told you, it might not work. So that's just the non-legalese way of being... It's getting yourself covered. And Amira does have some templates. I know they ask where to find them. Amira has some fantastic templates. I have some templates. We have different bundles of templates, so definitely check stuff out. And I will say, obviously, and I think Amira, you would agree, the best option is to talk to an attorney But if you can't afford that, the second best option is templates from an attorney, not just from anywhere. So due diligence, Amira's an attorney, she's fantastic. Her template's fantastic. So just keeping that in mind.

[00:21:42.920] - Amira Irfan
Yeah, I love that. Just don't go for the free ones, because trust me, guys, those are not going to protect you. And Heather knows.

[00:21:50.930] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Yes. Okay, next question is from Linda, and they are asking, is it a good or bad idea to take a casual blog and turn it into a business blog? How would you suggest doing this and what are some alternatives? Chelsea, I feel like you're nodding your head like you want to.

[00:22:09.630] - Chelsea Clarke
Sure. Yeah, I would say you can take any blog that you have and then monetize it later, it's going to be a little bit harder. But the thing is, if your content is high quality and the audience around that content, around your brand is engaged, is interested in what you're writing about, then you can pretty much monetize anything. There is an affiliate program for just about every niche, everything that you can think of. The most important thing is to think about your content as you want to answer someone's problem or you want to show a problem that they might be having and the solution being the thing that you sell at the end of the article. So you tell a story, you include things that are really helpful, so you can still have it be a casual blog, but it's still monetized. It's still making you money. You're still solving people's problems. And you can do that with any type of blog. It just does take a little bit longer if you haven't monetized before, but that shouldn't stop you from trying. Definitely worth it.

[00:23:10.780] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Does anyone want to add to that?

[00:23:13.550] - Sage Grayson
That's literally what I did I had an advice blog for a year, just casual answering questions, giving advice, telling people how to be more productive. And then I saw life coaches and business coaches getting paid for the same information I was giving away for free. So I'm like, Hey, I can do something with this. So I literally had no intention of becoming a life and business coach. But when I saw that it was even an option for me, I transformed my blog into my business headquarters.

[00:23:44.720] - Liz Stapleton, Host
I like it. Any final words before we go to the next question? I feel like that was a pretty solid. Okay, the next question is from Diane. They say, I've written over 350 posts on my blog. What are some of the best low cost ways to leverage that body of work and get more visitors to my site? Anyone want to start. Amira.

[00:24:09.290] - Amira Irfan
Okay. One of the ways that you could look at is your content that has resonated the most with your audience, maybe the blog post that's generating the most traffic, I would look at a way for it to monetize even further by creating a digital product that was related to that, maybe an extension of the blog blog post, maybe something else that's related to that topic because you already have validated that there's your audience, there's traffic to that particular blog post. Now, maybe take it a step further and create a digital product, maybe a guide, maybe an ebook, maybe a printable, something small that's not going to suck up a lot of your time. Then also add it and also create a freebie for it so that you can build your email list. This way, once again, you know your audience is interested in that particular topic. Now you've got a freebie associated with that to build your email list. Then on the back end, maybe it's a little too much, but on the back end, sell that digital product. Now you found another way to monetize from that just one blog post.

[00:25:17.970] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Anyone else?

[00:25:19.480] - Heather Ritchie
Heather. I would say, of course, have you done SEO? Because if you have 350 posts, that is so much content that you could be getting traffic to. So if you haven't, I would work on optimizing your old posts, and then I would do things like Pinterest, which is that quicker traffic that a lot of us do in the beginning. And of course, you can take what Amira said and one of those little digital products that you make and put it into a bundle or summit and do things like this to get traffic, too, while you're doing that. Because 350 posts, I feel like, is really good. You could really be making a lot of money, build up your traffic, and then even do display ads if you want to. Yeah.

[00:26:01.330] - Sage Grayson
I've had good success doing a lot of this stuff. Taking your old blog posts and repurposing them, almost all of my YouTube videos are blog posts. Of course, I tell them, Hey, if you want to learn more about the blank, click the link and get my freebie, and then I get them on my email list that way. I use YouTube as a way to get people on my email list in addition to getting that YouTube ads revenue, and sponsors.

[00:26:28.240] - Amira Irfan
That's great.

[00:26:30.800] - Liz Stapleton, Host
I was going to add, I don't know if Chelsea wanted to say something first. No, you're good. I was just going to say something. I think when you have that much content, and I'm not just saying this because they're sponsoring tomorrow's panel, it's because I use them, Link Whisper, and making sure all your posts are interlinked, because then you're going to keep people on your site longer and they're going to go through. So it's like you're getting more bang for your buck of the traffic you do have, and that just helps with SEO in general.

[00:26:58.840] - Heather Ritchie
Well, Link Whisper is It's really easy to use, too. I use them, too. I love them. I have them for as long as I've known about for five years or something like that. So definitely second that because that's all about SEO, too.

[00:27:10.890] - Sage Grayson
I love and appreciate people who at the bottom of their blog post is like, If you want to learn more about blank, here's three other blog posts. Because then I can just spider the web through their site, getting all the information that I need. It's so helpful. It's disappointing to me now when I go to a blog and there's like, But wait, where's more on this? And they don't lead me to the next step.

[00:27:31.860] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Yeah, yeah. So I think if you have that much content, you haven't already been doing that, that's, I think, a low hanging fruit for you. Okay, moving on. What are some common mistakes that beginner bloggers make when trying to run their blog as a business?

[00:27:49.490] - Chelsea Clarke
I think one thing that really stands out, and it was mentioned a couple of minutes ago, but it's so important, is the mindset, like Amira was saying, the mindset of being like, this is a business, this isn't a hobby. I think, Sage, you mentioned this, too, where you're going into it like you are starting a business, you are monetizing it, you're getting up early, you're putting the work in. You're not just writing an article here or there. This is a business to you. All of that effort that you put in and you really, with your mindset, believe it's going to work out, it actually will work out. I know in blogging communities, you're going to hear people say, Oh, it's normal to just not make money in your first year blogging. I do not agree with that. It is not normal to not make money in your first year of blogging. So if you're not making money and you've been blogging for more than a year, something isn't working. We need to look at your, your links. We need to look at your content. We need to look at your digital products, how you are promoting them.

[00:28:43.740] - Chelsea Clarke
Are you showing up on social media or not? So it's usually a broken link there where we're just not promoting as much as we should be. And that could be a huge hurdle to get over. And once you start doing that and having that mindset, it's all going to fall into place.

[00:28:58.820] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Yes, I wholeheartedly agree with that. Yeah.

[00:29:04.520] - Sage Grayson
I would say another mistake is not having a call to action at the end of your blog post.

[00:29:14.240] - Sage Grayson
We just talked about out, either leading them to other blog posts, leading them to your freebie, leading them to a paid product or course. I tell my clients, never, ever leave them hanging in anything. So end of the blog post, what's the next step? End of the social media post, what's the next step? End of the course, what's the next step? End of the freebie, what's the next step? Always have a call to action when they get to the end of anything with you. I mean, you're the leader, you're the business owner. So take them by the hand and lead them where they need to go to get the solutions that can help them. It's not bothering them, it's not being salesy, it's being of service.

[00:29:50.330] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Yes. Yeah, you always promote more than you think you need to. I think it's a solid... You might feel like you're annoying people, but don't impose your limiting beliefs on others.

[00:30:04.890] - Sage Grayson
I love it when someone tells me what the next step is. Like, thank you. You just save me a lot of time in searching.

[00:30:11.290] - Liz Stapleton, Host
All right. Any other mistakes you guys want to touch on before going to the next question? Any other thoughts?

[00:30:16.900] - Amira Irfan
Yeah. I'll speak to the one that I'm guilty of. I made the mistake as a beginner blogger of being a perfectionist, and that has to do with the fact that I'm a lawyer, so everything I touch or everything I I need to analyze it to the fullest, and Liz can relate to that maybe. But I was guilty of that. And pretty quickly, I realized that I'm spending way too much time on my website, my sales pages, my emails, and my blog posts, and nothing was getting done. It was bogging me down and also resulting in a lot of overwhelm. I feel like people can relate to that. I've learned ever since then that done is better than perfect, and that's very much true. Just make sure that don't get bogged down with the small details. Focus on the high-quality work, your value that you're creating and producing. That's more important than the nitty-gritty like, Oh, how does my page look? How does this look? That look. Sometimes we can just get really down into the details and waste a lot of valuable time. The other thing I would mention really quickly is what I've seen firsthand is bloggers making a mistake of not protecting their blogs legally.

[00:31:28.000] - Amira Irfan
That's another thing that you want to avoid. I just have a strong foundation. I just had to say that because I'm a lawyer, but also because I've seen bloggers actually coming to me with legal mistakes. So make sure to take care of those two things from the very beginning.

[00:31:42.520] - Liz Stapleton, Host
By the way, real quick disclaimer, just because Amira and I are lawyers, we're not your lawyers. Yes. You got to do your due diligence. Since we're bringing it up, we got to cover ourselves. Okay, next question. What are some unexpected challenges you faced running a blog as a business and how did you move past them? What are challenges you've come up against, even as you've grown, not even just starting out?

[00:32:10.090] - Amira Irfan
Go ahead.

[00:32:11.150] - Heather Ritchie
Three really quick ones.

[00:32:13.780] - Sage Grayson
Haters, getting really nasty, abusive comments on my blogs. It got so bad that I hated to do this, but I had to close the comments on my blogs. Even with spam blockers, even with keyword blockers, it still got through. It's pretty bad on my My YouTube channel, too. That was really frustrating just having to deal with haters. The more traffic you get, the more people see you. Second one is people stealing my content. Yes, I'm so glad that I trademarked life editor. That's mine. Nobody else can use that. But it's still people stealing my whole blog post or stealing my programs and stuff. I'm like, This makes no sense. You're not a book editor and a life coach, so why are you calling yourself the life editor? I used to waste a lot of time chasing after people, but I've had to just... I'm protecting myself. People will figure out that they don't know what they're talking about or they won't be able to back up what they're putting out there and just having to let it go, which was hard. It was hard, but I can't spend my whole time chasing after people. Then the third one, which was frustrating, losing accountability partners.

[00:33:24.480] - Sage Grayson
This happened at least five or six times over the 14 years that I've been blogging, is there, I get an accountability partner and we're working on our blogs together and we're going to post our blogs, we're going to send our email newsletter, we're going to get those products out there, and then they would burn out and close their businesses and close their blogs. I'm like, I become a bit of a hermit for the past few years on my own because I've never found an accountability partner who actually sticks around and keeps blogging. I just see so many blogs closing from burnout. Those were unexpected things that I faced.

[00:33:59.990] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Yeah, no, I would agree with that. And I mean, sometimes you outgrow an accountability group and it just isn't serving everybody. That's another thing that I've had happen, which it wasn't necessarily a fun experience to go through. But ultimately, it's what was the right move for me. So, yeah, no. You grow and you learn, and you try to find more people, and hopefully the summit helps with that for sure.

[00:34:28.540] - Chelsea Clarke
Nobody likes to get hate comments, but at the same time, it's more engagement for your account.

[00:34:33.610] - Liz Stapleton, Host
I'm like, that's how you know you made it. I had to, my first big hater on my original blog, they subscribed to my list just so they could send me an 800-word email about how I was wrong about something. And I was like, made it. I'll unsubscribe you. Bye.

[00:34:52.230] - Sage Grayson
Unfortunately or fortunately, they never comment on my my teachings as a coach or my advice It's always personal attacks that I'm fat, I'm ugly, I'm going to hell, all of those things. And I don't want my readers, my lovely life, I don't want them seeing that.

[00:35:10.600] - Liz Stapleton, Host
So that's why I- It's not the community you want to foster. All right. Anyone else want to comment on that? Challenges you faced, unexpected, how you dealt with them? No? Okay. What would you say are some financial aspects bloggers often overlook and underestimate? Because I feel like finance is the really tricky part of business that I struggle with, even though I started out as a personal finance blogger, business finance is a different beast. So anyone want to comment on that? Anyone has feelings on that?

[00:35:47.430] - Chelsea Clarke
Get a bookkeeper, get a great accountant, have someone work on your books. Don't try to do it all yourself. You're probably going to do it wrong. And it's just not worth risking that and getting in trouble because also those people that can help you, those professionals, it's so worth it because they know things that you can write off. You can do so much in your business and have a lot of the things that you need for your business written off and paid for when you have the right person on your team figuring that stuff out for you. So highly, highly recommend. Don't try to do your own books.

[00:36:19.070] - Heather Ritchie
And honestly, I pay my bookkeeper less than I would like the TurboTax self-employed version. I think it's about the same. So it's peace of mind for me I know that the IRS is not going to come after me and I can take all those wonderful things off.

[00:36:34.800] - Sage Grayson
Yes.

[00:36:37.870] - Liz Stapleton, Host
I'm guilty of doing it all myself. I might need some names from you guys. All right, so we do have a follow-up question from Diane who says, Fabulous content. Ladies, thank you so much. How can I multiply my audience for my blog? I don't currently do any paid advertising. I don't have a budget for that. I know it will take time, but I'm pretty sure the audience comes before the money. How do you grow your audience without spending a bunch of money? I think is the root of that question.

[00:37:07.000] - Heather Ritchie
I'm hoping to not- I'm hoping to not- Go ahead, Heather.

[00:37:09.830] - Chelsea Clarke
Didn't mean to cut you off.

[00:37:10.880] - Heather Ritchie
Honestly, if you are still growing your SEO, One of the best things that I ever did was start participating in bundles and summits because that's going to get a flow of people. Now, I'm not going to say that they're less quality. It's just different. I feel like summits can be better than bundles, depending. You just really need to be choosy about the ones you participate in. But SEO takes time. We want to be making money, like Chelsea said, within the first year. That's just a really good way to do it. Take that little digital product, get in a bundle, or do a summit like this. Then you're also going to show yourself as an expert in your niche. People are like, Oh, hey, I remember her. I've talked to her. I saw her at this summit or bundle. Plus, you make good connections for collaborations, too.

[00:37:55.830] - Amira Irfan
Yes.

[00:37:57.790] - Chelsea Clarke
That's huge. The networking element that you can tap into other people in your industry. It's the best thing ever. And I think we all didn't get stuck in like, oh, I'm blogging. So I'm in my blog. I'm in my bubble. But most people are not in your blog bubble. Most people are on social media. So pick a social platform that you like. Currently, I'm loving TikTok. I'm finding that it's a lot of fun. And the reach there is so much better, at least for me, than something like Instagram reels, which I'm... Don't go to my Instagram and look at my reels. But my TikTok, I'm finding it's really good for helping to bring traffic and new people into my funnels for my blog. So it's just a nice way to give legs to your blog, go somewhere else, put your face out there, and people will come to see and recognize you as that person who does that blog thing.

[00:38:46.160] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Yeah, yeah. Growing your network and like... Because that's how you find guest post opportunities. I would say running a summit is a pretty good way. Not only do you then get to meet all your fantastic speakers and everything, but you end up growing your list from all the and everything. So I will say it's a lot of work. I wouldn't do that first year blogging. You could. I've known people that have done that, but I feel like you're probably better off doing a second year. That's a second year project, but it's a good way to grow Sage or Amira, either of you want to?

[00:39:20.780] - Sage Grayson
Oh, I would say get comfortable being the face of your business and the face of your blog. I know a lot of bloggers just hide behind their words and their pretty Pinterest images. But when people are buying from you, they are literally buying you. They can get the same products, the same advice, the same digital courses from a million other people, but they want to buy from someone that they know, like and trust, someone who gets them on a personal level. So that's where you have to get comfortable showing your face, whether that's on TikTok or on social media or me on YouTube. I encourage my clients to put their face in the banner of their newsletters so that every Every week when your newsletter is going out, people start associating your words with your face. They start to recognize you. And then when they see you in bundles and summits and other places, guest blogging, they're like, Hey, I recognize her. And it adds to your authority and your expertise. So you start your business for a reason. So stand in your power and say, This is my business, and show your face.

[00:40:23.070] - Amira Irfan
Yeah, no, I agree. I think those are all a really great point, especially personal brands, they sell. You can't just hide behind your business. I know as bloggers, I'm the same way. If it were up to me, I would just sit behind my computer, not show my face, not talk to anybody. But I've noticed that the more you show up, the more people can trust you, like you, or hate you, whichever way it goes. But that's how you find your people. The other thing I would add is just diversify your traffic sources. Maybe the first year, you're working on Pinterest and Google, maybe the second, third year, you're working on YouTube. Again, you're just getting different sources. And like Chelsea mentioned TikTok. Maybe one year, that's your goal. Like, Hey, this is the platform I'm sticking with. I found Instagram to be great for me in the last year or two, but that's because I started creating more reels. So it started working out for me, but it may not work for everybody, right? So you just got to try and see which platform that you're very comfortable with to diversify and add to your traffic.

[00:41:26.570] - Amira Irfan
Yes.

[00:41:28.400] - Liz Stapleton, Host
And I just want to add to that. First of all, side note, I do open up applications for speakers. So if this is your area, then in the fall, keep an eye out for that. But no, but there are... One person that comes to mind, Ami Hook-Ireland, whose session went live today. My summit was the first. She had ever attended. I think it was 2021. And I remember her because she sent me an email saying this was so great. It was one of the nicest emails. So by the way, tell people if you like their stuff, because it will stay with them. Not a ton of people do that. I mean, there's... Yeah, he's a use this testimonial. But when you're just out of the like, hey, this was so good. I remembered her name. And when I saw her application, I was like, oh, my gosh, yes. Be genuine. Tell people when you like their stuff, it'll stick with them. And when you're at the level that you're ready to collaborate with, and they're going to remember that. And even if you're not at that level yet, that might be your stepping stone because you've just established that connection.

[00:42:27.110] - Heather Ritchie
Well, and since this is going to hit on another question, that you're going to bring up, but it's authenticity is key. I know a lot of us, when we start, we're really scared to let our personality out because we're like, I'm going to scare people away. I'm goofy, I'm funny. I show up with no makeup on. And once I started being me, that's when, Ami, I love Ami. She's on my list, too. She's just such a great personality, but she's one of those people that was drawn to my personality. So that's when you find your true following and the people that will be your biggest fans when you show up as you, even if you don't wear makeup like me and you're goofy.

[00:43:08.160] - Liz Stapleton, Host
All right. Moving on to the next question. Looking back, what is something you wish you'd done differently when it comes to treating your blog as a business?

[00:43:19.660] - Amira Irfan
I'll go.

[00:43:20.960] - Sage Grayson
Guilty again.

[00:43:23.230] - Amira Irfan
One thing I wish I had done differently was delegated and hire people in my first year. That's a mistake I made, guys, all about being honest and forthcoming here. I waited too long. Even though my business generated six figures in my first year of blogging, I still don't know it was a mindset or it was just there was a mental glitch that maybe I just didn't want to get rid of the control, or maybe I was afraid of hiring the wrong person. Don't know. But I just took on so much work on my own. I could have easily just hired people whether it was blog post writers, whether it was graphic designers, whether it was social media managers, there was just so much potential out there for me to not experience that overwhelm. I just put it all on myself. It wasn't until I think it was my second year that I finally realized that what was I doing? I had all this money from my blog that I could have used wisely to delegate and hire people, and I just didn't do that. That's one mistake that you definitely want to avoid because your growth is going to increase so much faster when you start building a team, when you have a network of people that are working for you, all of you guys are working towards a common goal, it's just going to really speed up things.

[00:44:41.010] - Amira Irfan
Also, you're going to enjoy blogging a lot more because I remember my first year, I did not enjoy. Every vacation was like work. I was still with my laptop and my husband would take me to these fancy vacations and I would just be there on my computer blogging. That's something I made a rule to myself after that first year. I never, ever want to do that in my life, and so I don't anymore. I completely unplug, I disconnect, and I'm only able to do that because I have people that I can rely upon to manage and take over the business in my absence.

[00:45:12.120] - Liz Stapleton, Host
I would also argue delegating helps you to really systemize your business.

[00:45:15.850] - Heather Ritchie
Yes.

[00:45:17.270] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Because you don't realize how unclear your directions are until you try to give it to someone else and how much is in your head.

[00:45:24.820] - Amira Irfan
Yes, absolutely.

[00:45:27.830] - Heather Ritchie
I think that's one thing that I would have done differently, too, is I was trying to systemize in the beginning, but it has made me so much more organized. I can get way more stuff done. And when you go to delegate, the people aren't really confused with what to do. I know systemizing your business may seem overwhelming itself, but it really just comes down to documenting each step that you write a blog post, figuring out a good project management system that you can use. I am a Trello girl, but I didn't like it in the beginning. It wasn't until I did a complicated launch that I fell in love with it. It's finding that tool and just really making sure you have everything organized because then you can find things easily and that will help you with growth, too, exponentially.

[00:46:15.820] - Liz Stapleton, Host
I'm a ClickUp girly.

[00:46:16.720] - Heather Ritchie
I love ClickUp, too. It's a very good platform. It would be my second.

[00:46:23.880] - Sage Grayson
I feel like I've used all of those project management ones. I feel like I've used every single one, and I switched between between where my head is at and what projects I'm working on, depending on which one I'll use. I'm currently using Todoist, but I still use Trello for a long time. I used Asana for a long time, too.

[00:46:43.230] - Chelsea Clarke
I would just add, I wish that I had set better boundaries for myself in the first year for how people can reach me. Nowadays, I have pretty good boundaries. On Fridays, I just don't work. Whether you email me on a Friday, you'll hear from me on Monday. Just setting those boundaries, setting those with my team, letting people know, clients, customers, just knowing that I'm there, I will respond when we're back in the office, which is my couch. Just having that time set that is just you, you're chilling, you're doing whatever you love to do, so you're not blogging all the time because, yes, we're here talking about blogging as a business and it's all this work. But really, you need to have the time to relax and enjoy your life, your personal life, in order to support that blogging business.

[00:47:26.980] - Liz Stapleton, Host
And for most people, that's why they started to blog, is they want a business that allow them to... So if all you're doing is blogging, it's not doing the job you started out for it to do. Yeah.

[00:47:39.320] - Sage Grayson
One mistake that I made was Frankensteining my business for too long, where I felt like every month I was being nickeled and dimed by subscriptions for a payment processor, for a blog platform, for a portal platform, for a call scheduler, for all of these little things, for my memberships I was like, all these little things. And when I finally said, enough of this Frankenstein, my business is together, and nothing talked well, even with the Zapier, none of the programs talked well, none of the plugins. Everything was glitching and I looked so unprofessional. When I finally sucked it up and got a CRM, a customer relationship management program, that changed everything and leveled me up tremendously. I currently use Kajabi, but there are great ones out there where everything is in one place and everything talks to each other. And You don't have to hunt around for things and you're not getting all these different subscriptions every month. Oh, it was awful. If there's a way that you can level yourself up by having everything in one place, you look so much more professional. If you can even get what I did, I got a free month first, and then I started paying for it.

[00:48:47.520] - Sage Grayson
I worked my buns off that first free month, getting programs set up, getting my membership site set up, getting my newsletter template set up, getting my blog set up so it looked so good that by the time I was charged for my CRM, I was already making plenty of money to cover it. And my CRM cost less than all of those little bits and bops I was paying for every month. So that was a mistake I made, Frankensteining my business. Don't do that.

[00:49:16.130] - Liz Stapleton, Host
All righty. So we did get another question submitted. Then I think we got two others. So the question is, and again, it's a legal one, what about copyrights for content produced with AI, like ChatGPT, Mid journey, etc. First of all, I wouldn't touch art-generated AI with a 10-foot pole, personally. There's so much lawsuits and stuff going on with that. With ChatGPT, some of the... and Amira correct me if I'm wrong, some of the legal stuff that's come out basically is if you didn't substantially alter what produced it, you can't claim a copyright.

[00:49:54.570] - Heather Ritchie
Correct.

[00:49:55.660] - Amira Irfan
Yeah. If you just took the content that ChatGPT generated, midjourney images or anything, and there was no human element to it, you didn't put any of your touches to it, then yeah, it's not copyrightable. There's been so many lawsuits going on right now. This is a hot legal topic right now, and it's still in the process of getting some direction from the courts. When it comes to AI, I wouldn't trust that whatever content that you're creating, don't expect it to be something that you could copyright. If it's original, just so you know, copyright law says that when you create a content in the original form, intangible form, it's absolutely original. That's the stuff that you can copyright. We're talking blog posts, we're talking books, we're talking music, we're talking software, things like that. As a general rule, you You can't steal. You get an automatic protection. You don't even have to register, at least in the US, you don't have to register officially in order to- Original works. Yes, exactly. If it's original work, and then if you wanted to register, you could. That gives you more legal to stand on, then you could bring a lawsuit for copyright infringement and claim statutory damages and more money for any violations.

[00:51:10.860] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Yeah.

[00:51:11.280] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Actually, I do think there was a case that said that AI-generated art was not copyrightable. I think that's actually has been argued. But I would be more worried about infringing on others' copyright with AI-generated artwork. I won't go near that. Text I think I'm a... But...

[00:51:32.570] - Amira Irfan
Yeah. So many book owners, I don't know if you saw that lawsuit, but so many authors are being suing ChatGPT.

[00:51:39.710] - Liz Stapleton, Host
They're suing, yeah.

[00:51:40.320] - Amira Irfan
Yeah. Because they're saying that their books were... There's been violations because of the content being all open and everything. So yeah, you got to be very careful with what tech content that's generating. That's why I always said, even when you're using AI, you got to put your human touch to it. You can't just rely on that content and just post it on your website freely and expect no ramifications.

[00:52:03.590] - Heather Ritchie
Don't you have an AI template, I believe?

[00:52:06.950] - Amira Irfan
Yes, I do.

[00:52:08.460] - Heather Ritchie
I saw that come out. I was going, Oh, I need to go get it.

[00:52:11.240] - Amira Irfan
Yes. I have an AI content disclaimer template because so many people reached out to me. By the way, all my legal templates were created because people like you, awesome people like you, reached out to me asking for it. I appreciate that. But yes, that one is there. Thanks for the reminder, Heather.

[00:52:27.440] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Yeah. I feel like we could go on and on on the legal of AI because it is a really hot topic. But I'm going to stop this right there. That's the gist. Okay, so let me see where our list of questions are. Let's end with, because we are running out of time, how can bloggers set realistic and measurable milestones to track their progress?

[00:52:50.950] - Heather Ritchie
What are ones you're looking for? What I end up doing and what I have found has really streamlined everything for me is I only have one or two big main goals a quarter because you're going to have other tasks to do, but when you do that, then you're able to get rid of the tasks that are not going to help you meet that goal. And then you can step things out. Like if I want to increase my income by 20% in quarter four, what am I going to have to do each month? What am I going to have to do each week to try to make that goal? And being clear with those smart goals, they need to be measurable. You You just can't say, I want to make more money in quarter four. You need to be able to set them so that you can tell if you made them or not. So that was one of the biggest things that I probably didn't really start doing until two or three years ago that's really helped me get more efficient.

[00:53:46.070] - Sage Grayson
This is my presentation for tomorrow. My presentation is Pomodoro Powerhouse. I'm talking about always, always, always working with the Timer. I specifically show how to use the Pomodoro technique so that you're always racing the clock to get your next task done. I know so many people who are like, I've got to write a blog post, and they take two weeks to do it. I'm like, No, no, no. If you start timing yourself, you'll see how long it actually takes you, and it's probably less time than you think. Then once you have that data, then you can do something with it. You can say, Oh, I know it takes me whatever an hour to write a blog post, and you can schedule that into your day rather than just letting it drag on forever. Also, you can use Pomodoro the technique, to get other things done. You can have a marketing Pomodoro, you can have a commenting Pomodoro, you can have a writing Pomodoro. But using a Timer, creating that sense of urgency so you're always moving forward. I had no urgency my first six months of business, and that's why I sat on the couch watching reruns.

So don't do that. Always work with a Timer. So you're constantly moving forward. Five minutes of progress is still progress. So take those wins where you can get it.

Chelsea, Amira, anything to add?

[00:55:04.750] - Chelsea Clarke
Go ahead, Amira.

[00:55:06.140] - Amira Irfan
No, I think those are very valid points. I agree with the goals. I mean, for me, honestly, I don't sweat too much the numbers. That's another mistake that new bloggers make, they worry too much about, How much traffic am I getting? How many sales I'm I getting? How many email subscriptions I'm getting? Again, it just leads to more overwhelms, especially in the first year. I would say just focus on the big parts of your business. You got your email marketing, you got your blog post writing. If you are creating a product, you got your products and that networking and marketing and things like that. Just simplify things for yourself. I'm more about simplifying than overcomplicating things. Then within those buckets, I then come up with my goals. Okay, maybe it's four blog posts a month, and that's it. Then I don't worry about it more than that. Maybe it's just one product every six months or one month or whatever, whatever your number is. Then you just stick with that and take actionable steps to get there. You don't have to really complicate things for yourself too much.

I like that. I have ADHD and I'm very prone to shiny object syndrome. I get pulled if my interests take me here and they take me here. I know if you're a blogger, it's really easy. If anyone here is watching and relates to that, you can get run over pretty quickly with too many things and giving yourself too many tasks. So something that really worked for me was creating a really simplified morning routine where I got up a couple hours before my kid gets up for school. So I just have this quiet house to myself where I can just sit down and write. Every morning, just focus on some creative writing. And then that just sets the pace for the rest of the day. And then just really being aware of that shiny object syndrome. Yes, you could take on a million projects, but you know that you shouldn't. So stopping yourself or writing it down. So maybe it's something you can work on in the future, but just really sticking to the goals that you've set. And like Heather said, I do that to quarterly goals, and then that way it doesn't seem so overwhelming, and you get a lot more done by feeling like you have less to do.

[00:57:11.460] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Yeah, and I would just add that your goals and your metrics aren't the same. So a metric is tracking how... You could have a goal of I'm going to write a blog post every week. And then the metric you see, if that's helping you, is what traffic are you getting? Having a goal of I'm going to get 50,000 sessions, you can't actually control that. You can control how many blog posts you do. You can control how many pins you make. You can control how many times you email your list. But you don't get to say, I did all these things, now I should have 50,000 sessions. So just keeping that distinction of a metric versus a goal and what you're working towards. They go together, but they're not quite the same. But I think we we need to wrap it up. We are in the last two minutes. Any final words? Tell people where to find you, what to do next. We will start. We'll go backwards this time. We'll start with Chelsea.
