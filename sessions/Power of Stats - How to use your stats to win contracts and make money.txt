[00:00:13.790] - Gergely Varga, Speaker
Hi everyone and welcome to the 2022 Blogger Breakthrough Summit. My name is Gergely Varga. Today I will talk about the power of stats and how to use your stats to win contracts and make more money.

[00:00:27.450] - Gergely
For those of you who don't know me. I am the founder of Authentic. Authentic is a smart reporting tool made for bloggers. It is now used by thousands of bloggers worldwide and we are growing fast.

[00:00:39.990] - Gergely
I have also been working in the influencer industry for the past six years, and with my wife, we have two successful blogs, You Could Travel and Yuzu Bakes. You Could Travel is a travel blog and our main business. In normal circumstances, the blog reaches over 5 million people a year. Yuzu Bakes is a vegan blog focused on sustainability. It is a young business, that's getting close to 1.2 million people a year.

[00:01:09.690] - Gergely
So Power of Stats, what does that even mean? Well, you need to produce creatives that resonate with your audience and take stats and data into account, but without compromising on your creativity. As a result, your creatives will be seen by an engaged audience that connects with you and converts into loyal customers. This means you now have the stats to show your value to brands.

[00:01:38.190] - Gergely
Here is the overview of today's talk. Build an engaged audience. Create the right content for your audience. I will talk about the importance of an engaged audience, why it is important to know your stats and how to use your stats to get paid more. I will explain what Authentic is and how to use it to make more money with it. I will also have a quick demo of Authentic and then lastly, I will talk about how to pitch new clients and win more contracts. At the end, there will, of course, be some time for questions via the chat.

[00:02:16.210] - Gergely
Most of you already worked with brands or businesses before, some of you got paid and others might just do this on a busy basis. As my wife and I are travel bloggers, our top priority when making money is to travel to new and exciting destinations. We couldn't always pick and choose the type of clients we wanted to work with or the destinations we wanted to visit. It's been a long journey to get where we are today and I will try and share some of the things we have learned along the way.

[00:02:45.270] - Gergely
One of the most important things that contributed to our success was building an engaged audience. We all know building a large and engaged audience is difficult. There are so many different channels fighting for our attention, and it is not easy to stand out. Still, the best advice is to be yourself. Our advice is to find a niche that fits you and fits your personality.

[00:03:09.550] - Gergely
Here are a couple of questions you can ask yourself: What is your business about?What is your value proposition? And why are you different than everybody else?

[00:03:21.010] - Gergely
Answering these questions, we discovered that when you write a blog, the most important asset you have is yourself. Being yourself is the easiest because it allows you to be the most authentic self even in the context of your business. People who are interested in you and your story will stick around. You can safely ignore the haters and the naysayers. They are not your audience. Although it's worth mentioning, they also contribute to your ad revenue.

[00:03:51.890] - Gergely
When posting new content. It's important that you are passionate about the topic. We call this authentic content because it's the easiest type of content to produce. It'll just come naturally to you because it's based on your interest and your experiences, and your audience will know that you are invested in what you post about and will happily join in the conversation.

[00:04:13.550] - Gergely
The same happens when you post sponsored content. When you pick the brands and sponsorships, make sure they are relevant to you and your audience. This is especially important because this way your post will generate a clear and real engagement. And I'm telling you all this because brands look for impressions and engagement as indicators of a successful post. Simply put, an engaged audience is going to make you more money. They will return to see your recommendations and purchase the products you sell. They are the ones who open your newsletters. Click "like" when you post something new on social media.

[00:04:53.030] - Gergely
So why is this important? Why am I telling you this? Brands usually like to look for influences that offer a somewhat guaranteed based outcome, meaning they have a good idea of what the ROI for their campaign is going to be and what outcome they should expect.

[00:05:10.250] - Gergely
By having an engaged audience, you almost always have a predictable model on how post is going to perform. Use your stats to showcase this information in a readable format that is easily digestible by the marketing team. Brands love an engaged audience. You will have a much easier time convincing brands to work with you. When you can show that your audience is engaged and active, better stats mean that you will convince more brands to work with you.

[00:05:40.370] - Gergely
So now that you have content and an engaged audience, it's time to see some numbers. If you have a blog, you probably have Google Analytics installed. Your social media accounts, of course, all come with usefull stats. Why is it important to check these stats?

[00:05:55.490] - Gergely
For two main reasons. One, use the data to make better creative decisions. For example, you can use your stats to check if your audience likes the newest trends on Instagram, and the other reason is based on the data. You can determine where is the best place for your creative content. For example, we all know that spontaneous server posts usually perform better on TikTok than on Instagram. Check your numbers and make decisions based on that. Hard numbers are the only thing that measures the success of your creativity, the better these numbers are, the better your chances of working with your dream brands.

[00:06:38.070] - Gergely
So when you work with brands, they will want to see a return on their investment. To create an ROI report, you will need to show your stats to determine the success of the campaign. Usually, brands will ask you to send them screenshots of your posts and stats. This is obviously very time-consuming and tedious to do. It is also difficult to provide these stats for content that has to mature first, like blog posts or YouTube videos.

[00:07:06.570] - Gergely
We had the same issues. And the more we worked with brands on campaigns, the more time we spent putting together long PDF documents with screenshots to show our results. Because of all this, we decided to create Authentic to automate and make this process simple.

[00:07:24.210] - Gergely
Authentic is an online tool that you can use to quickly collect your stats for each social media post and add them to a beautiful and easy-to-digest report. The generated professional reports are clean, easy-to-understand, and ready to be sent directly to your clients. They can be customized with your logo to fit your brand. And the best part, all the stats update automatically within the reports so your data never goes stale. You don't have to remember to update the stats on those blog posts you created three months ago. The stats are ready to be sent to your clients.

[00:08:03.290] - Gergely
I will now have a quick demo of Authentic. Authentic is a smart reporting tool made for influencers. You can use it to create ROI reports in minutes and share these reports with your clients. You can sign up to Authentic for free at any time. The free account is great for most influencers and it allows you to connect all your social media accounts and blog.

[00:08:26.130] - Gergely
The premium plan is for more established influencers who have multiple blogs or influencer businesses. It allows you to create multiple profiles and share unlimited case studies with your clients.

[00:08:41.850] - Gergely
After you log into Authentic, the first thing you see is your dashboard. I am now logged into Yuzu Bake's Demo account. This account doesn't use real numbers but works exactly like a normal account. On this page we list the social media accounts you can connect to and their current status.

[00:09:00.590] - Gergely
You can connect to your social networks directly from Authentic. Pinterest and TikTok do not currently support this option, but you can download our Authentic browser extension for Chrome to connect your account.

[00:09:15.790] - Gergely
Below the list, you can see some stats about each of your accounts. These stats are live and pull direct from the social network when available. This is meant to give you an overview of your stats and usually display insights for the last 30 days.

[00:09:31.390] - Gergely
Now I'm going to connect an Instagram account to Authentic to show you how quick and easy it is. A quick note you will need both an Instagram business or creator account and a Facebook business page for the connection to work.

[00:09:47.090] - Gergely
Facebook will ask you a couple of questions to confirm you are okay to connect your account. The last step is to select the account you want to connect. This step is important if you have multiple Instagram accounts connected to your Facebook. And it's done.

[00:10:04.150] - Gergely
While Authentic downloads the first ten stories, I will show you how profile looks like. This is your public profile on the top. You can customize it with your own picture or logo and write detailed description about you and your business. On the side, we display your latest stats and insights. These are public and can be viewed by your clients, when you share your profile with them. And in the middle, you can publish your past reports as case studies to show your clients what they can expect if they want to work with you.

[00:10:44.330] - Gergely
Now that the post have downloaded from the Instagram account, let's head to the media wall. The media wall gives you an overview of all your social media posts and blog articles you have in Authentic. It provides an easy to use interface to filter and search all your posts.

[00:11:04.310] - Gergely
On the top you can add some posts manually. For example, all Instagram stories can be added if you have a screenshot and the stats handy. This is useful because while we automatically download your Instagram stories every day, Authentic can only access stories that are not older than 24 hours. Pinterest pins and TikTok videos can be added to Authentic using our Authentic browser extension for Chrome. It's a quick and easy way to pick the pins and videos you need. Authentic will take care of the heavy lifting for you.

[00:11:38.750] - Gergely
Now that we have seen the dashboard, the profile, and the media wall, let's create a new report.

[00:11:46.710] - Gergely
The Reports page shows you a quick overview of all your reports and the campaigns you have been invited to. Reports are a great way to show the social media posts and articles you have created for specific clients or campaigns alongside your stats and engagement. Let's create a report to show off all the posts which we have about breads. I will call this report Best Breads.

[00:12:14.350] - Gergely
When you create a new report, you can customize a few things, like the report background and the campaign date. If you are creating this report from specific campaigns. Let's have an image of a nice herb bread as a background image.

[00:12:47.090] - Gergely
The description section allows you to explain more about the report, like explain who is the report was created for, what was the campaign about, and share details about the target audience, just to name a few.

[00:13:00.590] - Gergely
And finally, the part where you can select and add your social media post to the report. Click the big green button at the top of the page to open your media wall. I'm going to search for posts that contain the word "bread" and click on a few posts to select them.

[00:13:26.550] - Gergely
Once I have all the posts I wanted to add. I click Save and close, to close the media wall. Now you can see all the selected posts are listed on my report. The only thing left to do is save the report and check the results. At the top of the report. You can see the image we selected earlier and some information about you.

[00:13:47.790] - Gergely
There is also the report description with the details I explained earlier. The block in between gives you the URL you can use to share the report with your clients. Reports are private by default and can only be accessed using this unique link.

[00:14:04.770] - Gergely
And now let's look at the stats. Based on the posts you have selected. Authentic generates your stats and insights and displays them in a simple and easy to understand way.

[00:14:15.020] - Gergely
On the top, you can see a summary of all your stats, total impression and engagement of all the selected posts. Below a breakdown of stats by each social media. Here we display the total impressions and the engagement rate when available. Further down, you can find a more detailed breakdown of stats specific for each social media and then each post. For example, Google Analytics can give you insights into sessions and users for each post, so we display those numbers. While Facebook has clicks, comments, and shares.

[00:14:53.710] - Gergely
All these stats combined make up your report and most importantly, the stats are always up to date. Once the posts added to the report, we keep them updated for you so your reports don't go stale and your clients can access the most up to date information at any time. This is especially important for blog posts and YouTube videos, which usually take time to mature.

[00:15:16.330] - Gergely
For example, blog posts usually take two to three months to start showing useful stats. If you use Authentic, you don't have to remember to collect these stats yourself. This report will be automatically updated for you.

[00:15:29.770] - Gergely
You can see how powerful the reports can be, but how can you use them to make money? If you haven't worked with clients before, you can create reports based on a specific topic that fits the type of clients you would like to work with. When you pitch clients, send them the reports as part of your pitch to show the sort of engagement they can expect if they work with you. If you have already worked with clients before, you can use these reports as case studies to show new clients what you have achieved in the past. It's a great way to make it easy for guns to say yes to you.

[00:16:05.530] - Gergely
And finally, you can always create reports for yourself to track the improvement of your social media accounts and blog every month. Having these reports and seeing the increase in traffic or engagement can be a great motivation. I will now continue with the presentation.

[00:16:25.190] - Gergely
Now imagine how professional you will look when you send over these reports to your clients after a campaign showing off your amazing results and your engaged audience. Since we have been using Authentic, we've got incredible feedback, amazing testimonials, got offered more work and got recommended to other brands.

[00:16:45.230] - Gergely
If there is one thing we learned while running this business is that it's our job to make it easier for brands to say yes. Here is how. Provide them with a proposal that saves some research, show a return on their investment to save them money, and give them an auto updating report that saves them time.

[00:17:06.230] - Gergely
How to win new clients with this approach.

[00:17:10.310] 
As we started using Authentic for past campaigns, we quickly realized that the reports can be used as case studies to pitch new clients.

[00:17:19.890] - Gergely
It worked like a charm. Since we started sending out previous reports showcasing our results alongside our media kits. We went from pitching brands and hearing nothing back to getting answers within 24 hours, saying that they are interested in working with us.

[00:17:37.790] - Gergely
As a result, we could charge more for our content and pick the clients and campaigns we were interested in. It is now obvious to us that businesses like to see authentic results before they spend their money, so make it easier for them to say yes and brands will love you.

[00:17:56.450] - Gergely
The keys to building a successful influencer business are a loyal engaged audience, authentic content, and authentic stats. You can sign up to Authentic for free.
