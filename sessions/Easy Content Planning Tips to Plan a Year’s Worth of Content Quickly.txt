Well, hello and welcome to Easy Content Planning Tips to plan a year's worth of content quickly. My name is Heather Ritchie and I am a certified content marketing strategist, SEO content writer and blogger over at Writer's Life for You. And my whole goal is to help women who want to work from home for a better work life balance, so they can spend more time with their family and friends. Like that's my main objective with everything that I do. And content marketing is one of the best ways that you can make money with your content. So, it's super important to make sure that you actually have a content plan, which I know can be easier said than done when we all have all those things to do in our business, especially if you don't have a team.

[00:00:58.780] - Heather
So, I'm going to give you some quick tips and you'll just see how amazing it will be to be able to plan your content much quickly. So, let's dive into the lesson.

[00:01:10.840] - Heather
All right, guys. We are going to dive into the presentation now. Easy Content Planning Tips to plan a year's worth of content very quickly. We're going to get started here. Of course, you met me just a little bit ago. I'm Heather, and in case this is your first time meeting me, I am a certified content marketing strategist, SEO content writer, and the blogger behind Writers Life for You. I basically help freelancers and other solopreneurs start and grow successful online businesses. And I also write SEO-optimized content for bloggers and small businesses. So, this is what you're going to learn. You're going to learn why having a content plan is so important and basically why you should care about it. I'm also going to give you some smart content planning tips and you're going to learn the things you need to do to create a content strategy and plan to actually execute it. So before we jump into this, I do want to tell you that I basically have a framework. It's a three part framework that I call ACC for your content planning process. So it starts with getting to know your audience and then we go on to creating your content strategy.

[00:02:27.900] - Heather
And then the final stage is creating your content plan. So here's why you should care about content planning. Content planning allows you to plan ahead. Which may seem kind of simple. But really I see a lot of people that struggle with this because I remember being in the spot where there's so much to do as a blogger or solopreneur. And the tasks just keep piling up and you know you need blog articles and you know, you need to promote them and you know you need other social media content and other types of content, and it just gets overwhelming. So, something has to give. So I found myself, I knew, especially with affiliate marketing and things like, you know, bundles, that I was a part of like ultimate bundle genius blogger toolkit or the writers toolkit. I knew that I needed to get content out there which really means, when it comes to affiliate marketing, especially, it means your email marketing and then your social media marketing. And so, I found myself hurrying through like, okay. I know I have to get all these posts up and I know I need to write all these emails but I was so rushed that I wasn't taking the time to really sit and think what will connect with my audience and then the messaging was probably falling flat because I wasn't taking the time to really think about what I was saying.

[00:03:55.320] - Heather
I was just trying to get it out there because I knew I had to get it done. So content planning was a lifesaver for me because allows me to plan ahead and then I can spend more time on that messaging because you really need to connect with people to make more money. When you're selling products, services, courses, printables, whatever, you really want to connect with your audience's pain points to make money. So, with the planning, it allows you to be efficient and develop a content plan that allows you to focus on creating and promoting your content versus sitting there wasting time just trying to figure out what to write even. It also allows you to focus on messaging, which I just mentioned and create content based on the product, service, courses and even affiliate products that you promote. Creating content centered around your promotions set you up as an expert with a helpful solution and that works whether it's your own problems or you're like hey, there's this product I use all the time, I think you should go get it. So, it also helps you avoid common content mistakes and I'm sure that we are all guilty of committing some of these content mistakes but for instance, having a content plan ensures that your content is relevant to your audience and it's unique.

[00:05:09.330] - Heather
You want to stand out from everybody else, you know pick those polarizing topics that will set you apart. Like I just described what my framework is do any of your solutions like any of your products, printables, printables can be a quick win and that's very helpful too. Or any of your courses and products, do you set yourself apart? So that you're unique and your solution is the one they need. It also allows you to optimize each piece of content for better engagement. So, once I got more organized with my business in general, I wasn't whipping through hashtags on Instagram quick, I had sets of hashtags that I could use that would just easier to copy and paste, which is really helpful because I've been in a bunch of real challenges where I've now done a real almost every day for, I think it's been over a month now. So, a lot of content creation, that's considered content creation too. Also, a documented content creation process and workflow allows you to maximize efficiency. So, once you have a system and like a workflow, and you do that same process over and over again, it allows you to be much more efficient.

[00:06:17.890] - Heather
And then with a content calendar, you can stay on top of all those tasks and timelines and make sure your content is published on time. And Trello is my goto. You're probably going to talk about it more, but I love Trello, and I didn't used to. I was one of those people that wanted to like it, but didn't until I had a really complicated launch and it was like a lifesaver. So, what I like about Trello content planning is I have one place to go for all the tasks. Like, I have a master task board in Trello, and I keep adding to it and adding to it, and I switch, I use labels to see which are important, which are urgent. And it allows me to also create a plan where I pick a main promotion every month, and then my content for the month centers around that promotion. Or if I know I have a course release in May, you know, say, for my Content Planning 101, I'm going to talk about content planning and set myself up as an expert in my niche. And so, it really, really, really helps you stay on top of all this tasks, and it also helps you identify your audience's pain points to ensure that all your content marketing is successful.

[00:07:30.550] - Heather
It's like I keep saying, you know get to know your audience intimately. You almost want to be like a stalker in a good way. You know what keeps them up at night? What are they worried about? What do they need right now? Or what is one thing or one problem that you could fix that would make their life easier? And then planning also helps maintain engagement. The process doesn't end once you hit publish, a good content plan factor than following up to get more engagement. And so, I've been trying to do this, which is why I've been in these real challenges that's on top of my content planning, I'm trying to drill down and learn what I need to do on Instagram to connect with more people and help more people. And that includes going and commenting with other people's you know reels and posts and liking them, and following up with people, commenting on my reels and things like that. So, you really do want to set aside some time to kind of just run in and reply to comments and things like that. And you can do it once a day for like ten minutes or less. Sometimes, I do it during my relaxing time.

[00:08:33.960] - Heather
I'm a night owl, so I don't stop work till like 10 'o' clock at night, and then I, like, chill. But sometimes I'll respond to comments during that time frame. And content planning is difficult for many businesses. So, the better you get at it, the further it distances you from your competitors in a good way. So, once you get really good at this, this is something that not all business owners are good at and they need help doing. And once you start drilling down your messaging and getting better with your planning and everything, then you're going to start to set yourself apart because your content is more meaningful, it connects with your audience better and that puts you way ahead of other people that aren't even focusing on some of those things. So, here are my content planning tips and they kind of flow through the process. You'll probably see where I start talking about the different parts of my framework. So, one of the first things you want to do is identify the types of content that works best for your audience. And what I always say, excuse me, is you know, before you can create a content plan, you need to create a content marketing strategy basically.

[00:09:48.510] - Heather
And that involves doing a lot of competitor research. And at the end of this, I'm going to jump in and do some competitor research with you, so that you can see what I mean. But part of this is looking to see what content they're using and what content or even evaluating your own content that you currently have and see what types are working. So, identifying the types of content that your audience likes is crucial. If your audience prefers to watch videos and hang out Instagram, they will probably watch a lot of reels for example, so that's video. Other content examples include live streams, like Facebook livestreams, user-generated content and that would be like, if you have a challenge or say you have a bingo game in one of your summits, and you encourage people to share that bingo game and tag you, so that's basically promoting you. You know these people are in this challenge and they're loving what they're doing and they're promoting you. So, user-generated content is becoming more and more popular. Then there are challenges in contest which I just mentioned. But you know, a challenge could be a five-day challenge on content planning for instance, or content creation, anything that you can spend a day on a certain piece.

[00:11:15.420] - Heather
Like I have a five-step niche process called the niche ninja, and there's five steps. On day one, I can work on step one and help my people, you know, do that. Day two, I could help them do the second part. Day three, I could guide to the third part, and so forth and so on. So, those are powerful too. And then there are checklists. And I don't necessarily mean like the checklist on your blog, although definitely promote your free checklist, but it's more like social media images that have checklists on them. Also, questions. Questions can get a lot of engagement. Memes and Gifs clearly are popular, and I'm excited because I'm in a course right now that teaches you how to make your own gifs and gif yourself. And then there are case studies like client success stories. Infographics are really shareable. Polls and quizzes, like I think those are some of the most fun content to actually do for people. And I think polls and quizzes work in just about every niche. Excuse me, I've been almost coming down with a cold. And then there are reviews and testimonials, live articles, comments, and quotes, and how-to guides.

[00:12:27.040] - Heather
And so, here's the get to Know your audience, be a stalker but in a good way. So, the key to attracting your audience and getting them to buy your courses, service and products is to get to know them intimately. Where do they hang out? What do they do in their free time? What are their biggest fears? What keeps them up at night? How can you make their life easier? So, this section, I kind of lumped the two C's together just for this presentation. But here's where you want to create and document a content marketing strategy and plan. And these are some of the pieces of that. It's super important. You can't create a content plan without a strategy. The strategy is the research and thought put into creating an effective content marketing campaign. And then the plan helps you execute your strategy. The strategy is your vision, while the plan is your roadmap to get there and achieve the goals. This process also includes setting goals, establishing content themes, and perfecting your messaging. So, here are some examples of common goals that you want to set for yourself with your content marketing. And you can have different campaigns for different goals.

[00:13:40.320] - Heather
So, increasing your website traffic in one really popular one, sales and lead generation, increasing your brand awareness, increasing community engagement, and growing your brand's audience. And so, a lot of these kind of can work together. And you will usually have more than one content built clearly, because you probably want to increase community engagement. Like with your people on Instagram, you probably want to increase the engagement with them. Increasing brand awareness is super important. And then growing your audience on all the social media channels, on your blog, like these are really, really important content goals, but there are many more. These are just five of the most common ones. And so, you want to find out where your audience hangs out. And this is key because your industry can greatly affect this and you know your niche, what you do, how you do it, where your people hang out, it's going to be different for different businesses. So, it's vital to your success to decide which channel to focus on. And if you're just starting, I recommend you sign up for multiple accounts on different social media channels, so that your name isn't taking. Because my Twitter name got taken.

[00:14:58.990] - Heather
So, I'm the prime example of what not to do, but sign up for them. But only choose one really to focus on and learn it really well before you move on to another channel because that's going to be key. And it's really hard to manage like five channels if you're brand new. If you're established, you probably have already been working on multiple channels and you can keep doing what you're doing. Just try to make sure you're where your people are. So, the different channels are like Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, Clubhouse, TikTok Twitter, LinkedIn, the WhatsApp, pinterest, Snapchat. And here's where you know, the industry that you're in affects the platforms for you. For instance, Pinterest is a great niche for crafting, DIY, beauty, all that. But security companies likely won't find their audience there. I mean, you don't see many professional security CEOs and such on Pinterest. I mean, that's clearly a very distinctive but they're going to be on LinkedIn. Whereas if you're in crafting or DIY, you're probably not going to be on LinkedIn because LinkedIn is more for professionals. And it's not saying that crafters and DIYs aren't professionals. It's just saying that that is more for like, it's not just for CEOs, but it's more on the business side of things.

[00:16:18.780] - Heather
It's the number one social media channels for businesses. So, yeah, you need to find out where your people are hanging out. That's super important. And competitor research is really important too. It's very helpful as it can help you figure out what type of content works best for your people, the social media channels they use, the topics they talk about, and more. So, when you're looking at their social media problems, look at the following. First of all, what platforms are they on? What are they posting about? What hashtags are they using? And I'm going to show you some of this in just a little bit, and what posts are working for them, and what are the comments on those posts. And it's not enough to know what social media channels you want to use, you need to know how to manage them. So, how will you manage your social media channels? Are you going to use a tool like, for instance, I use publer or post schedule or social bake? Or are you going to outsource that management? When Pinterest, before Pinterest lost his mind and went crazy, I had a Pinterest manager that was getting me a lot of traffic.

[00:17:19.530] - Heather
I had up to like 1 million, you know, viewers a month or views a month. So, I outsource that because I just didn't have time to grow my community. And she did a really great job. And then from your competitor research, and I mentioned this a little bit ago, with the different types of content, you would decide on those types of content that you want to create. So, through that competitor research and then your preferences decide on the types of content you want to create in your content marketing strategy. Don't worry, you can create various styles. Just make sure you include some that your audience likes best. Note that video should be at least one of these, as it's very popular across almost every industry. I can't think of any industries that don't use video. And if you're not comfortable, I get it. I used to hate video, but the more you do it, the better you get. Like if you saw me on Instagram reels in the beginning, I sucked. And I still have problems lining up the lipsyncing, but I just have fun with it. And that's the whole idea. Like I'm laid back and have fun and that's part of my brand.

[00:18:22.090] - Heather
So, decide on those types of content that you want to create, and you can use some of the ones that we listed. Now it's time for demonstration. So, we're going to exit all out. I'm using Helen in between. It might be Helen in between. I might be saying her name wrong, but she's a very, very popular travel blogger. As you can see, she has $216,000. She's a really good one that I wanted to comment on and to use as an example. So, she mostly does reels. I think she might have yes, she mostly does reals. And she just went to New England for, I think it was in September, probably maybe the beginning of October for the lead changing, which over on the East Coast we have some beautiful, beautiful lead change colors. And so, she went up there. So, I can look at, you know, what type of, a lot of times, short captions work best, but sometimes you want to explain and go deeper into things. So, you can see what types of captions she's using. Here are some of the hashtags she's using. She also has these spots up here that you can click on.

[00:19:37.780] - Heather
Oh, wow. She's got a lot I'm trying to bring up some of the stories. It's not because someone has left to expire. That's right, she is from Germany. Oh, this is a story. I think she promotes beauty stuff too. So, does anyone believe the Denver Airport conspiracy theories exist? So, yeah, that is really actually a true thing. That's really funny. So, me, no way. What are you talking about? So, see that's very engaging, like that's just making you laugh, looking at it. So, you can see she does a lot of stories and reels. In fact, I didn't see a whole lot of regular posts, which honestly, I do regular posts because I get some engagement. But at the same time, video is where it's at. So, you can just scroll through, I mean, she has 5000 likes on that one. One of these had like 30,000, I feel like, maybe that was just views. Now this post is 12.2K. Yeah, so she gets a lot of engagement. This is the 38.8 likes, and it's when her husband asks for a glass of milk, which is really funny, actually. Yeah, wait for it. Notice the hair, apparently, he has messed up hair too.

[00:20:56.750] - Heather
She's just really real. And I was speaking at a conference or summit not too long ago and the participants or the people that were watching were like, you guys are just so down to earth. And that's really when you can make people feel comfortable and you're not too stuffy. Being personable and real is perfect. I mean, it's just here are her hashtags that she's using. Travel community, travel tips, travel dogs. You can just bring a lot from this. See, this is like a really short one. And so, then we also have her blog. So, I love her blog, she has so much fun with this. So, take a look at the different things. Like, she teaches about blogging, too, which is how I found her. But you can see all the different. Like, she has these blog posts, so you can actually get content ideas from her on the things that you want to focus on. I love her blog. This must be a lot of places that she's been. So, she has all these guys. This is probably going to be her. Okay, here we go. So, the perfect girls trip, the road trip guide. Like if you're a travel blogger or an RV or all the above, you can get content ideas from your competitors.

[00:22:26.820] - Heather
Like, oh, okay. So, this is the stuff she's writing about, you know Instagram captions, how to use a credit card to travel, seven days in Scotland. You know these are, you know, the things that she loves to buy on sale. And of course, there's hocus pocus, it's funny, so you can really get a lot of information from your competitors. Jump back into my little presentation if I can find it. Okay, there we go. Let's jump back in. So, this is completely wrong. See, here we are in real time having an issue. So, I am actually going to be giving you guys 20 questions that you need to ask yourself when creating a content strategy and plan. And these are some really good questions that are going to help you, basically, outline your whole plan, get to know your audience, and understand all the information that you need to know to make that plan. I think it's going to be super helpful for you guys to just sit down, answer those questions. I mean, you can answer them flat out first. You can answer them as you go because they all kind of flow together during the process, and then you'll have all the information that you need.

[00:23:54.240] - Heather
And I am also including my training in the all access pass bundle. So, if you get the all access pass, you will get my Content Planning 101 training that, I did it live, and then now it's a course. So that it will guide you through the process of getting your content plan mapped out in two days or less. So, I hope this information was really helpful other than my blunder here with the blog post outline, which is not what you're getting. But I'm just really excited about this topic, if you can't tell. And I can't wait to see how you plan your content. So, I hope you have fun seeing the rest of the presentation. Bye.
