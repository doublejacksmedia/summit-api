Marlene, thank you so much for coming back this year.

[00:00:52.990] - Marlene
Yeah, thank you for having me.

[00:00:55.310] - Liz
Absolutely. So, today we're going to be talking about writing mistakes for beginner bloggers because, you know, people went to school, right? But writing for the internet is very different. So what are some of the writing mistakes you see newer bloggers make when it comes to creating content?

[00:01:14.960] - Marlene
Well, the first one definitely is that, like, you learned how to write in school and it's almost like you need to unlearn things that you were taught. And I don't want to say that cause my AP English teacher would probably hate me for that, but I don't know, I just remember writing papers in school and using a thesaurus to like, let's think of a smarter word or a better word or how can we make this sound more professional? And writing for the web is just not like that, and people get really stuck, I think, in this mode where they are using too much jargon and a little bit stiff rather than leaning into conversational copy and something more personable and something that sounds like an actual human would write. 

[00:01:59.400] - Liz
Yeah. And paragraphs that are too long because you learn in school, you've got to have the intro, you've got to have three supporting points and then a conclusion of the paragraph. And that's just not how writing online works.

[00:02:08.910] - Marlene
Yeah, exactly.

[00:02:11.510] - Liz
Okay, so you kind of touched on, you know, instead of trying to sound really smart like you would for school, being conversational, being relatable, what are some ways people can kind of try to retrain themselves to write that way?

[00:02:26.140] - Marlene
You know, something that works really well for some people is trying something like, text to talk or reading it out loud. Once you read something out loud, you can literally hear, like, how stiff your words might sound. And I still do this myself. Like, I'll read the post, like, in WordPress, but then I'll preview it and you read it again, you print it out, it sounds different. Like, there's all these different methods that editors use for whatever reason, just because when your eye is used to seeing something, like multiple times, you'll glaze over things. So if you see it in a different way, like print it out or if you hear it, like something might click there that you wouldn't otherwise. Something else is really simple, is like, use contractions. People, again, they get stuck with this I want to sound professional, but in real life, we use contractions. We use slang depending on your brand and your audience, like, they may speak a certain way and you're going to want to attract them, which means sounding like them.

[00:03:26.290] - Liz
And I want to go back because you did mention jargon.

[00:03:30.940] - Marlene
Yeah.

[00:03:31.520] - Liz
And sometimes, especially if you really been in your space for a long time, you don't even realize what's jargon anymore. So do you have any tips of kind of identifying that so you can make sure your writing is clear?

[00:03:44.290] - Marlene
Ask your best friend, your mom, your sister, your spouse, like, anybody, like if you have someone. I know people get like self-conscious about their writing, but you can literally just pretend you're writing to your friend or ask them if they're in this. They're like, hold up, I don't know what you're talking about. Like, I don't know what this means. And you know, right there. Okay, I need to explain this in layman's term, in like a more approachable way.

[00:04:07.390] - Liz
Yes. Okay, thank you. So first mistake is writing for school rather than for the web. What is another mistake? You see a lot of writers making.

[00:04:18.410] - Marlene
Writing for themselves, I think is another one. I know when Blog started, it was kind of like, dear Diary, I ate this for lunch today, and then I dropped my kids off at school and then I bought this new shirt and that was kind of like what a blog was. And typically, if you're like a business owner or a blogger and influencer, you're probably following other bloggers and influencers. So, you might want to emulate them and you see them writing posts like, this is what I'm reading right now, or this is what I'm loving. But when you're starting out, you don't have an audience. So I don't want to be mean. But nobody cares. They don't know you yet, right? So, They don't really care what books you read or what your favorite thing is. You have to reach the audience first and grow to a certain level before you start writing about, like, me, me, me. And make sure that you're solving their problems and helping them out and that's going to make them more interested in you, anyways.

[00:05:18.260] - Liz
Yeah, I mean I think we touched on this a little bit in your previous session last year, but it doesn't necessarily have to be a huge shift to go from writing for you versus writing for them. Do you have any tips on that?

[00:05:31.540] - Marlene
Yeah, you just reframe it. So, if you're watching this right now and you're freaking out, like, oh my God, all my content is like me, me , me, you can just go back to your content and think about how you can frame it so it helps them. So, you know, if you wrote about, like, five summer reads that you really enjoyed, maybe that post can be like, you know, the best summer beach reads for you to take on your next vacation, and just literally tweaking that language from, like, my favorite to like, you should read this and you should do this, and this is how this will help you.

[00:06:04.990] - Liz
Yeah. And maybe as you read, see how many times you say the word you versus I or me. That might be another just hint that your thought is too much about you, potentially. Okay, so what is, I think what is another mistake that you see a lot of the time?

[00:06:25.540] - Marlene
Whenever we have these conversations, I always think of like, 30. I started with, like, three that I wrote down, and I wrote down so many. One of them that I will say that I see a lot is analysis paralysis, this striving for perfectionism. I see this in Facebook groups a lot, where people are like, how many blog posts do I need before launching my blog? And they're like, just launch it. Yeah, exactly.

[00:06:51.240] - Liz
Yeah. Zero. You don't even need one. Zero.

[00:06:55.650] - Marlene
Yeah, except for, like, your mom, you know, nobody's going to read it.

[00:07:00.760] - Liz
Yes. Yeah.

[00:07:01.330] - Marlene
So just get it out there.

[00:07:03.570] - Liz
Yeah. And I commend people for really doing their research before they dive into blogging, and so that they have a strategy from the get-go that is smart, except for the point where it can be too knowledgeable to take action. I had zero clue what I was doing when I started. I was like, oh, start a blog. And I like did it. And I was like, okay. But now I know, I basically just gave them an affiliate commission for Bluehost, right? But you know, I was like, okay, well, I'm just going to I remember hitting publish on that very first post and being so nervous, and literally no one saw it.

[00:07:42.340] - Marlene
It's like you're writing to a black hole, basically, in the beginning.

[00:07:45.760] - Liz
Yes. Yes. And it's funny because as you build an audience, you will make mistakes and you'll be like, oh, but then you'll fix it. And it's like, not even nearly as nervewracking as that first post was.

[00:07:58.610] - Marlene
Yeah, and not only that, but writing is one of those things that like you just have to keep doing it to get better at it. I can give you all the tips there are, but at the end of the day, like you have to start in order to get better. I mean, I thought I was great ten years ago, and then I read my stuff and I'm like, oh, like, everybody has that feeling, and you're only going to get better the more you do it. Yeah.

[00:08:22.860] - Liz
And two points to that, one, is if you're not looking back on your work from your own cringing, you're not learning. And then two, very few things are permanent blogging. You can update them later.

[00:08:39.160] - Marlene
Yes. Yes.

[00:08:40.610] - Liz
Google loves it. So like, just hit publish. Take imperfect action. Done is better than perfect, and you will learn as you go.

[00:08:48.040] - Marlene
Exactly.

[00:08:49.090] - Liz
Okay, so we've covered a few mistakes. I'm happy to cover a few more if you want, but I also want to talk about some best practices, you know that you might suggest for those people that are, you know, analysis paralysis and how to get out of that besides just being published. What are some best practices for them? Because they're going to need up. They're going to need like, I need a system.

[00:09:10.760] - Marlene
Definitely, just start again. Like, if it makes you cringe, that's okay. Like, you just have to, it does get easier the more you do it every single time. It'll get easier the more you're in a habit of doing it. I think outlines are exceptionally helpful for beginning writers, and a lot of people don't want to start with outlines. I don't know. I mean, even I was resistant to them at the beginning. I was like, I don't need an outline. But it really helps you not just structure your content, but not lose your train of thought, especially as, like, sometimes blog post can get really, really lengthy and you have to make sure that it's, like, structured a certain way and that it makes sense and you're not rambling and losing your reader. So I think outlines are a really great place to start and make sure that you're hitting all your points. And in that sense, that is kind of like something that you can stick with what your English teacher said, is make sure you have your main points and your supporting points and your blog post. But I think that's definitely any writer can use an outline.

[00:10:13.240] - Liz
Yeah, I don't know how people don't use outlines and write posts to be perfect, like I can't imagine it.

[00:10:19.240] - Marlene
Because you'll forget something, right?

[00:10:20.940] - Liz
Yeah.

[00:10:21.300] - Marlene
You'll be forgetting something, or you forget to type in the main point, or you might go off on a tangent, like it really is the backbone of what you're doing. 

[00:10:31.990] - Liz
Yes, okay. Any other sort of best practice tips that you have?

[00:10:39.040] - Marlene
You know, I do, I would say that writing's a great start. Editing is where the magic happens. Really, you know, some people just write and not go through the editing process, and the editing process is actually where everything happens. You might want to let your work breathe for a bit. So if you wrote today, edit it tomorrow, or a couple of days later, see it with fresh eyes. Little things like I mentioned like, printing it out, previewing the post, reading it to a friend. You know these are all little things that you'll be able to fix here and there, and you get better at it as you go along. There's also tons of free programs out there, like Grammarly is excellent. They have, like, a premium version as well, where it'll actually give you even more criticism and it'll tell you little things like, don't use the passive, you know it's passive voice, let's change it to active. Or this is a run-on sentence. So I think those are really helpful. And it's like a free tool, so like why wouldn't you use it?

[00:11:36.970] - Liz
Yeah, I mean, absolutely use the free version. I used the paid version early on, especially when I was freelance writing. You know, I think it helped make me a better writer overall, even though I don't really use it anymore. So, just something to keep in mind in that aspect. So, you mentioned you know kind of writing's the first step, magic is in the editing, and I couldn't agree more. But editing can actually involve a lot of different things besides just like looking for grammar or breaking up paragraphs. Like, what are some editing elements you see people just not even thinking about or you know not doing a great job?

[00:12:20.440] - Marlene
So, trimming the fat is probably the biggest one, is if you can say it succinctly, say it succinctly like, less is more. And sometimes people ramble and they may not even notice. And if you're like, I think people get really obsessed with this SEO, like hitting a target word count, which is great, but you can't be just writing fluff either. So, there is a fine line. And like typically, when I'm editing, most of what I'm doing is just leaving extra words that don't need to be there or modifiers that aren't making the sentence better. That's a little bit harder to do as a beginner, I think, is trying to see what words don't need there. But primarily, I still work with writers who I outsource things to and I'm, delete, delete, like doesn't need to be there, and it just makes it, like, snappier.

[00:13:08.740] - Liz
Yeah, I like that. Okay, one thing I do want to ask you about, because I think it's becoming more and more prevalent within the blogging sphere is AI, and using AI to help write blog posts. And I think it's a great tool to help write, but I think the magic still is very much in the editing. And I'm just curious what your thoughts are on that, you know the best way to use AI, if you think you should be using it at all. Just kind of your opinion on AI and writing.

[00:13:36.410] - Marlene
That's such a like million dollar question.

[00:13:39.420] - Liz
It is. I know

[00:13:40.000] - Marlene
So, I definitely have thoughts on this. I trialed a tool once. I did a trial because there was a lot of buzz. And I found that it was helpful in, like, if you don't know where to start your post, it kind of gives you, like, an idea of where to start. But ultimately, I didn't really think it was throwing out anything super useful other than maybe a generic introduction. It can't do the research for you, and really, if you're providing information, then you have to do the research. And it kind of, I found, like, it was like spinning content. So, I mean, if you really want to use it, like, to help you with an introduction or to maybe get some ideas, I guess you could use it for that. I can see how it's helpful for marketing copy. I know that they have like, you know the framework that will say like, attention, you know, whatever, interest, desire, that thing. But I mean I don't love AI. What can I say? I just don't.

[00:14:42.560] - Liz
Yeah, yeah. you know, so I don't love writing. So, actually, I really like using just to get like words on a page and it almost never ends up looking like what it spit out, you know, but it gets over that blank page sort of you know, even with an outline for that.

[00:15:04.750] - Marlene
So for that, my biggest tip is to not start at the beginning. So just start like, somewhere in the middle. I think even I sometimes don't know where to start. And the intro is like the hardest thing. So if you're stuck on an intro, like, yes, the AI can help you. Or don't write the intro. Like, start somewhere kind of in the middle. You have an outline, right? So, you know you can fill in like, the other stuff. And then once you're kind of in a flow, then you can go back and write your introduction.

[00:15:31.240] - Liz
I've been blogging for eight years and that's the first time I've ever heard that. And that is genius.

[00:15:36.040] - Marlene
Try it. Let me know how it works if you like it.

[00:15:38.620] - Liz
I will. I will. I'm like, oh, that makes perfect sense.

[00:15:43.420] - Marlene
There's no rules that you have to start at the beginning, right? 

[00:15:48.280] - Liz
That's very true. And that's the thing, especially, I wouldn't consider myself an analysis paralysis person, but especially if you are like, there's no hard and fast rules. You can make your own rules. I think it's another kind of point to remember. Any other sort of things that people should avoid when writing or best practices or mistakes that you think is helpful to someone who's trying to get into a blogging rhythm?

[00:16:13.990] - Marlene
I would say, I don't want to go, this could be a whole other workshop in itself. But I don't think people especially getting to pay enough attention to their headline, which is arguably like the most important part. And if you don't nail your headline, then no one's going to click on your post. So, then you just spent all this time and energy writing in this blog post and no one even clicked on it because your headline just fell flat. So that's another one where I feel like you can write it later or work on it after the fact if you're feeling stuck. There's like tons of headline generator tools. I think those are actually really helpful. And that's, I guess, a form of AI. I love those. They're super fun to get the wheels turning. Tons of free resources online to go with those. But I feel like I see a lot of headlines that are really vague or they're just not exciting enough. They don't incite emotion, they don't make me want to get, they don't make me want to click. And that's really the most important part, right? If you wrote 3000 words and your headline isn't there, then no one is going to read it.

[00:17:16.760] - Liz
Yeah. I will say I struggle with trying to create a great headline that's not too long because it gets cut off.

[00:17:24.790] - Marlene
That's okay. I write some long too, because I, you know something that I like to do is scroll at night on my iPad, like news. And you see all the headlines and, like, look at them. And the more you read them, you know, that improves your writing itself to just reading. You'll kind of see they write longer headlines. They use a lot of numbers. They can use a lot of things that make you curious, like, oh, top ten this, wait, till you see number three. And you're like, what's number three? Now I want to know. So, I think just seeing, even just scanning those passively in bed kind of like, gets you into that, seeps into your mind. 

[00:17:59.610] - Liz
Yeah. And I think a lot of people say, write multiple ones before you decide on the one you're going to use because that can just help get you know things moving.

[00:18:07.770] - Marlene
Yeah, get things flowing. Yeah.

[00:18:10.240] - Liz
All right. Any final tips? You know where can people find you, what? Yeah.

[00:18:18.710] - Marlene
So, you can find me. I'm sure you'll have links. You can find me, glitz-grammar.com. If anybody is interested in fashion and lifestyle, then you can find me on lifewithmar.com. If you are just starting out, I do have a free blog post template that you can grab to help you relate with that structure and that outline. It's literally just called the perfect blog post and where your headlines should be, where your sub-headlines to be. So that way you know exactly how to write the post. 

[00:18:47.220] - Liz
Yes. Because it really does matter. You want to make sure you're using the right heading, tags and everything like that. Otherwise, it can get really confusing for people, so.

[00:18:54.790] - Marlene
Yeah.

[00:18:55.190] - Liz
Definitely, go check that out. Links are below. And you know thank you again, Marlene, so much for coming back and sharing your knowledge.

[00:19:02.400] - Marlene
