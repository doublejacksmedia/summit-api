Hello, Blogger Breakthrough Summit attendees, I'm so excited to be here with you today, and I want to give a special thank you to the hosts of this tremendous conference. Liz, thank you so much for inviting me and having me share some valuable information today for you to blog consistently and effectively with a content calendar plan and the KISS method. Keep it simple.

[00:00:37.240] - Stacy
Now, let's jump right in. I'm so excited to share with you how to blog consistently and effectively with a content calendar plan. And of course, we keep it simple method in today's discussion. We are going to cover these five areas. We are going to cover number one, create your content calendar. Two, choose your structure and process. Three, craft your elevator pitch. You'll be able to do that while we're together in this presentation. Four, guest posts and guest interviews. And five, what is your premo plan?

[00:01:15.620] - Stacy
So, welcome. I'm Stacy Zant and I wanted to share a little bit about who I am so that you can understand maybe the expertise and of course, all the things that are on my plate, but nevertheless taking time to blog and to consistently and effectively show up. And I want to help you to do the same. So I'm a wife, a international best selling author, my blogger and speaker, my writing well, mentor and fearless creator. I'm a recording artist and the host of the radio Proliving podcast. I am course creator, coach and podcast producer. 

[00:01:50.980] - Stacy
So, before we go any further, I want to encourage you to download your Fearless Content Calendar sheet and Click Up template. You're going to find that this resource that I've prepared for you is going to help you streamline your steps as we're going through this presentation. And it's going to help you to start with the end in mind. You're also going to be able to envision what you want to create consistently on your blog and the content that you're creating and maybe the different formats that you've decided to get it out there. And then we're going to utilize the Easy Rinse and Repeat system and we're going to go over what that means. And then it's also going to include the done for you templates with recommended tools that you can access. So, we want you to have access to all of this in a simplified and I dare say beautiful format. So, much to share with you. Three components of the Fearless Creator Method that you're going to find throughout this presentation. We're going to concentrate on the KISS, but Keep it Simple Framework for the purpose of this presentation so that you can take some actionable steps and realize you can do this. You can achieve a breakthrough that you're looking for in your blog. And so I want you to decide to make this a part of your future Fearless plan as you blog consistently and effectively.

[00:03:19.450] - Stacy
Then I want you to decide the following: When do you want to produce content? What topics do you plan to address for your audience? And what tools and systems will you utilize each week to prevent overwhelm?

[00:03:38.910] - Stacy
And now, after you've done all of that, the bulk of the work and steps are completed to really making your blogging and producing content. For those of you who have tapped into the potential of podcasting, that goes so well with blogging. We're going to explore the fundamentals now to staying consistent by building a solid foundation that you can use over and over again. This presentation is surely for you if you want to know how to keep it all simple and just have a way of consistently and effectively getting your message out there as you experience Blogger Breakthrough today.

[00:04:17.580] - Stacy
So, in our first point, you're going to create a content calendar. It is so important that the content calendar begins your journey to Blogger Breakthrough because then you can start with the end in mind. I want you to think about what it is you want to achieve through your blog.

[00:04:38.220] - Stacy
Now, having that big picture plan of what you would like to achieve with the content you're creating, especially with a calendar before you, allows you to seamlessly plan what content you should cover. And that will take your audience on an intentional, effective journey that you have crafted ahead of time before the content is actually placed before them. And you'll find that that consistency will be so much easier for you.

[00:05:10.800] - Stacy
I want you to also consider this question. Are you hoping what are you hoping to achieve with the content you create? Are you hoping to achieve something in particular? Are you trying to get a certain pain point and certain relieved? Are you trying to take them on a journey to something else that you offer as a solution?

[00:05:37.140] - Stacy
And we're going to go a little bit deeper into this as we go on, if you can answer this of what it is you hope to achieve to creating that content calendar and planning in advance and having that big picture plan in mind, then trust me, you'll stay the course no matter how difficult it gets and no matter what things vie for your attention.

[00:05:59.160] - Stacy
So, to go a little bit further on the big picture plan I was mentioning to you just a moment ago, I want to present to you an example so that we can make everything really clear.

[00:06:09.360] - Stacy
If your goal is to have readers and listeners end up purchasing a course you created to help answer a specific pain point, for example, like business owners overcoming overwhelm through batching and creating templates for social media. And then you take your readers and your listeners through a journey to like, know and trust you in bite sized snippets of content that you're creating and placing on your blog. So, you can actually do this. As you see with this diagram, you can just take them on a journey, releasing specific content as time goes on. But it is all a part of the big picture plan as to where you are trying to really get your readers to go to so that they can have the complete solution that you can provide and that you've worked so hard to create.

[00:07:08.490] - Stacy
So, if you think about that main course that can come in the form of all of these different offers, some of them you can make free, some of them can be smaller offers. As you see here, the special offer, the email sequence, you can do a mini course, a workbook, a mini guide checklist, eBook, Podcast and webinar master class.

[00:07:28.660] - Stacy
And all of this is content for your blog to really make an invaluable resource for your audience. And I want you to think of what particular elements do you already have incorporated in your content creation plan and what other elements can you add to take them to that place and that big picture plan that you have in mind.

[00:07:51.330] - Stacy
So, now that you have this glorious place that you're leading your readers to, I want you to choose your structure and process. That's number two.

[00:08:01.290] - Stacy
You're going to stick with a plan for at least 90 days. And the best way to do that is to map out your journey and think about things in advance in terms of the content you're creating so that you can be consistent and effective.

[00:08:16.050] - Stacy
Now, you can have two different ways to have that structure and process in place. One is through a spreadsheet, which I've also provided for you in that freebie I've put together for you. And then we have the click up structured process and I'm going to show you multiple ways that this can look like right now so that you can see how easy and efficient the click up structured process can be as you're trying to decide what structure and process you will have in place and you will stick with for at least 90 days.

[00:08:48.900] - Stacy
All right. So, to give you multiple views of what it is that you are able to have as a structure. Right. You are actually going to be getting all of this, including the links and everything, for you to be able to access these formats as well as what I've plugged in here for you today.

[00:09:05.580] - Stacy
So, for your content creation, you'll see you have the list for you. That is one view that you can have off your content calendar plan. Then you have a mind map view. So, we have a view for any sort of person who likes to be able to perceive and make sense of what it is that they are planning, what it is that they're creating, in a visual way that you can keep at the top of your mind. Right.

[00:09:33.660] - Stacy
And then you have the Gantt view to you. All right. That's more of that timeline. And then we have, of course, our traditional calendar view with due dates. All right. And that is one of the things that's most effective about having this structured process is that you can plug in the dates that you want to have a reminder sent to you so that, you know, okay, I need to get this done before this particular date, so that I can stand the schedule and be consistent and effective. Especially if you have a launch coming up and you want to be able to get your audience excited and take them through a journey, a delightful journey where it doesn't totally catch them by surprise. Nor you, because you've planned ahead and you've allowed everything to be in tandem building one upon the other. That is the beauty about having a structure and a process like this in place with your Content Creation plan. And of course, I've made it available and easy for you.

[00:10:33.780] - Stacy
Now you're going to craft the elevator pitch and elevator pitch is just a brief, persuasive speech that he used to spark interest in what you do love does, your organization, your business, whatever you decide to call it, and you can also use them to create interest in a project, in an idea or product or even in yourself.

[00:10:57.890] - Stacy
So, keep this in mind as you're going to craft or elevator pitch in this session today. You're going to walk away with some actionable steps and things you can use.

[00:11:05.870] - Stacy
And of course, you see a picture of this notes page that was provided, Liz provided that, I'm sure, in the package. And you'll find that you can just go ahead and start making the notes with this example and you can use this product as a way of getting the juices flowing. When it comes specifically to your blog and online business.

[00:11:26.660] - Stacy
So, you want to focus on the problems that you solve and how you help people. For example, I normally say, do you know how people lack proper planning and time management skills to make their dreams and business success a reality? I provide a winning solution as a planner, web designer, podcast pro, editor and business coach. And then you can do the same thing. Ask a question.

[00:11:54.590] - Stacy
Start by saying, do you know how people at the dot, dot, dot. What is it that the people that you're serving your audience, what is it that they lack? And then you want to push past the issues preventing them from experiencing. So, tell them what did it what it is that you're helping them with. What is it that is an issue in their life that's preventing them from experiencing that freedom, that thing, that solution that you provide, and then you're going to say that you provide the solutions you need to do just that.

[00:12:28.870] - Stacy
Okay, so take the moment right now. I love normally in my sessions where we put on some music. If you want to pause, we want you to go ahead and pull out your pen. And I want you to start writing right down your elevator pitch and remember this message while you're still thinking about what is it that you want to put at the forefront to be your guide and also to guide others to knowing who is it that you serve and what solution to provide. Just remember, you can do this. Yes, you can.

[00:13:04.880] - Stacy
Can you believe now we're at number four? Just one more number to go. We're making and keeping things simple here. You want to have guest posts and guest interviews? I cannot stress this enough the power of collaboration is enormous when it comes to being a blogger and experiencing breakthrough. I want you to create a system of intake and streamline the collection of information submitted while leveraging your guests audience. Think about that.

[00:13:38.040] - Stacy
You are not just relying on the audience that you have been able to acquire and nurture over time, but think about those you've invited into your space who have expertise and so much value to offer as well, and allowing them to serve your audience. And in return, they are going to share what you have created and what you've been able to highlight them on, because, of course, it makes them also be an expert because someone else is endorsing them and having them share their expertise on their platform- your platform.

[00:14:16.710] - Stacy
And so you want to make sure that you incorporate having guest posts and guest interviews on your blog. I've seen it as simple as having a Q&A where you're asking the question, written out and then someone else that you've invited as a guest with their expertise, answers the question. And it can be read. Of course, one of my favorite ways is to do so in the form of an actual interview and being able to embed that in place. The actual blog content on your blog. But keeping it simple, you are able to just have your guest post questionnaire so that whomever is interested or whomever you've reached out to, to be a guest expert on your platform and your blog, they're able to answer that. And it keeps it so simple. All you have to do is just copy paste and place it there. And that's your ready-Made content to share.

[00:15:06.450] - Stacy
A pro tip though, is that you want to have guest interview, be that process where you can connect with the influencer that you've invited, that expert that you've invited, because once you've made that connection, it allows you to connect deeper with that person.

[00:15:25.680] - Stacy
They also get to know, like and trust you. And they are excited about sharing your content of how you feature them to their platform. And that is going to help, of course, give you both visibility and more partnership and collaboration in a deeper way. That is what I want for you. As a blogger that is desiring to experience breakthrough, this is going to be one of your keenest ways to do so in a very quick, easy and simplified way.

[00:15:58.800] - Stacy
So, now I want you to think about number five. Last but surely not least, what is your promo plan. After you've created all this amazing content and you've taken the time to collaborate and you've taken the time to really craft a journey, a beautiful, delightful journey for your audience? You cannot neglect. And I see this so many times where we just expect for it to go out into the universe and do its thing and make its mark and create effective, lasting change for your business and your blog. But no, you need to remember this and have it at the top of your mind each and every time you create content- what is your promo plan? And I know I want to encourage you to utilize social media without the overwhelm, knowing when to show up, when to pay attention to certain things and knowing what matters.

[00:16:55.050] - Stacy
So, you want to create graphics that are on Brand as you're creating your content. And of course, many people utilize Canva. That's such a simplified, easy way to just effectively be able to plug in and change up whatever wording. What it is that you want to highlight as your headline is a topic and create that catchy, relevant headline.

[00:17:19.350] - Stacy
Now, if you have templates, right, that you are able to access and utilize, then it allows you to spend time on what really matters, spend more time on creating the content that catchy relevant headline and think about it, do your research, then you can also have time to interact and engage in stories. That's where all the magic is happening these days. I know on Instagram it's Real's and people still love watching stories on any social media outlet, Facebook as well as Instagram. And so and I know that Pinterest to a degree, has it as well. So, I want you to share behind the scenes footage if you're asking, well, "Stacey, what is it that I should be doing as you're creating your content?" It could be as simple as you taking a picture off your computer screen and showing a sneak peek of what's to come and what it is. You're right. And take a picture of your keyboard and you're typing away. You're giving them an idea of your content creation process behind the scenes. It can be as simple and as enticing as the mouse that you use to click forward in your blog post. You know, it's just so fun seeing the things that people can come up with and that you two can share out there to keep people engaged and allowing them to go over to the content that you've created be enticed to know, "Hey, what is it that she's up to?" "What is this blog thing that she's doing?" "And she's so much dedicated time or he is spending so much dedicated time to it?"

[00:18:52.220] - Stacy
Of course, as I mentioned, templates that are easily accessible in your project management system, like I've mentioned before, Click Up allows you to utilize the Rinse and Repeat method. You can also use Google Doc and whatever is easy for you. And I'm going to show you here just how easy this can be. So, you can, of course, access the Click Up the system template and this particular resource here will also help you with being able to effectively having a promo plan in place.

[00:19:25.850] - Stacy
So, you do want to as that's loading and you'll see here, of course, this is live list format where you get a step by step way of just being able to access all the different things you want to do for your content creation plan. And of course, you can create your own and then utilize that over and over again for that rinse and repeat method as a template that all you have to go in, you can prioritize that. You can assign it to other people if you have a VA and there's so much further that you are able to go when you just have something you've created once. And all you need to do is rinse and repeat plugin and make your updates and publish. Right. That is what is going to take out that. Well, when it comes to having one of the most important parts of being a blogger, having that promo plan where you can show up in the different places and spaces to gain interest on the content that, you know, is of great value to those who you serve and not yet serve, but are looking for your solution that you provide. And you showing up behind the scenes and stories or in a Facebook groups when you're able to actually share your link or share your product or solution in those threads. I mean, the sky's the limit once you have a system in place.

[00:20:53.780] - Stacy
So, now it's time to break through. I want you to say that with me. I want you to write it down on your notes page that you've been attentively taking notes as to what to do, because I know it's a lot. Right. But I want you to take actionable steps where you are building the foundation that is going to be what helps you with breaking through.

[00:21:16.490] - Stacy
You're building the foundation to last; I would like to say a lifetime be. All you have to do is make tweaks here and there as you continue to grow, develop and really come into your own. I want you to achieve that as you blog consistently and effectively with a content calendar plan.

[00:21:37.670] - Stacy
