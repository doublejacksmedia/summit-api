[00:00:13.370] - Cat
Hi  there. I'm Cat and welcome. I'm here today to talk to you about Instagram. And I'm going to talk very quickly because I've got a lot to share with you today. Just quickly about my background with Instagram, I accidentally signed to Instagram because I wanted to build a travel account and I grew that account to 100,000 followers within about two years. Part of building that account, I became very obsessed with everything Instagram. And I'm also a University teacher.

[00:00:47.980] - Cat
So, I've combined the obsession with Instagram, passion for teaching. Now I offer a range of courses and resources for people who are looking to grow Instagram either for their blogs or their businesses. I live in South Korea, so I'm having great fun taking advantage of the Squid Games phenomenon that's going on around right now. And also this has no relevance to anything, but I am absolutely obsessed with Peaky Blinders. Okay, let's go get into the good stuff.

[00:01:21.090] - Cat
What are we going to cover? Well, I've gone with the title for today's presentation and Instagram - a social support for your blog, which is what it can be. It can be a great source of directing traffic to your blog, but also part of building up your brand, building up who you are around your blog. And we're going to look at some ways that you can use Instagram successfully alongside your blog today.

[00:01:51.810] - Cat
So, there's a focus on three different things. And first of all, optimizing your bio, so this will allow you to skyrocket your discoverability.

[00:02:05.730] - Cat
I'll explain why. It will help you to attract your ideal followers, and it will help you drive traffic to your blog if done effectively. Next, we're going to look at how to hashtag effectively. So, this again will increase your discoverability. The more people discover you.

[00:02:27.310] - Cat
The more people who can follow you, fall in love with your content and the more people that will head over to your blog as well. It allows Instagram to understand your niche. The more data we can give Instagram about who we are, what we do, the better Instagram is directing the right people to our Instagram account, and also they increase your engagement.

[00:02:56.490] - Cat
I'm very against like focusing on vanishing metrics. But engagement, it's nice to have people like your photos, comment on your photos, but increased engagement is a snowball effect of more engagement on your content. More people will see your content. If they engage, more people will see, more people will see, and so on. So, we're not focusing on the fantasy side of it.

[00:03:22.600] - Cat
We're focusing on the practical. How can extra engagement actually help get our content in front of people?

[00:03:33.250] - Cat
Okay. And number three, then I'm going to talk about the different neighborhoods and the different features on Instagram and what different content types suit for different purposes. Right. I've only got 30 minutes, so I need to go straight in with this. So, here we go.

[00:03:52.570] - Cat
First of all, we're talking about how to optimize your bio. Now, everyone gets very obsessed with finding the perfect handle for Instagram. By handle, I mean the @ blah blah blah. That's great and all. But your name, your bold section is just as important.

[00:04:14.170] - Cat
And the reason why is, this is the only part of all of your bio which appears under searches. If you're using hashtags, whatever other words you have in your bio, doesn't matter. You're not going to show up under any searches from that. The only part which will show up under searches is the name, the bold section, basically the path directly underneath your photo. So, in here you want to think about what keywords you want to use that your target audience will be searching for on Instagram.

[00:04:53.170] - Cat
I was travel blog. I'm from the UK, I'm female. I had a UK female travel blogger as my, so had @, so I had my first name and then UK female travel blogger. From me making that change in here. The amount of DMs, emails I got asking for collaborations skyrocketed. Because if you put in female travel blogger or UK travel blogger, only around 20 or 30 came up.

[00:05:27.130] - Cat
I was one of that 20 or 30. It was really easy for any companies, any brands to find. So, if your goal is to work, if you're looking for sponsorships, you're looking for brand deals and you're looking to promote work, collaborate with companies. Think about what they might be searching for and that's something you can include or the people who you want to be reading your blog, what will they be looking for? And be as specific as you can, but think about it in terms of what would they type into Google?

[00:06:04.440] - Cat
And you need to try and fit that in here. Now before you run ahead and go and start changing things, just pause a moment. So, you can edit this, but you can only edit it once every two weeks, so play around with it. See what will fit within your character limit, see how it looks visually. Don't hit save until you're completely happy with it, or else you get stuck with like half a sentence for two weeks until you can change it again.

[00:06:36.830] - Cat
Now there's lots of us here. Why don't you share your bold name in comments? Have a nosey what everyone else is doing. I will have a look. I'll give you some feedback.

[00:06:47.670] - Cat
Any changes that you might want to make on there. Any suggestions or if you really don't know what your bold name, your name name should be in there. Poking in comments. Let me have a look. I'll try and help you come up with something that fits your niche. And yeah, do have a nosy.

[00:07:06.440] - Cat
See what everyone else is doing. That's what I love about being in comments of like Summit's presentations, like this is, you can meet people by chatting away in the comments. So, Share your bold name. Share what you do in the comments. See what everyone else is up to and get some sneaky inspiration.

[00:07:25.130] - Cat
Okay. So, we've got the bold name and then we've got the main part of the bio. Short and sweet is the lesson here. Don't go on, I mean you can't fit more on page. You don't have enough characters, but don't just throw everything in there for the sake of it. People literally glance at your bio.

[00:07:47.940] - Cat
So, if they can glance at your bio and quickly see who you are and what you do, that's going to attract their attention. If they're faced with a wall of text and like, oh yeah, I'm bored of this and then move on to the next account because the odds are you are not the only account offering content of that style. You know there's a billion users on Instagram. There's a lot of competition out there. So, you want to have your main part of your bio very clear about what you are, what you do, who you are.

[00:08:27.590] - Cat
Use emojis, but use emojis to draw the eye.

[00:08:32.210] - Cat
Don't use emojis in place of vocabulary. So, for example, if your blog is about books and you write, I love and a book emoji and with a cup of coffee. That actually makes it harder for people to quickly read and take the information from your bio. Because they're looking at text image, text image. I'm sure this will change in ten years, but right now our brains are not quite geared up to quickly doing that mind shift. So, use emojis, but use them to, maybe like bullet point style, key information, but not in replacement of words in there.

[00:09:19.550] - Cat
And then the last one is don't use any hashtags in your bio unless it's a very very personal branded hashtag that nobody else is going to be using. Don't use any hashtags. The reason is a hashtag in your bio is clickable. They can click on that hashtag and that will take them away to other people's content. Then they're probably going to see something else that interests them and you've lost them.

[00:09:50.510] - Cat
And even if they want to come back to you, they might not remember who you are. They not remember how they got in your profile in the first place. So, don't give them the opportunity to click and leave your profile. Okay. And if you are wanting to use Instagram to direct people to your blog, then you can have a web link on your bio. Hey, it's actually changing.

[00:10:16.640] - Cat
It's going to be two web links, but at the moment it is just one. You need a strong call to action. People are on Instagram because they want to be on Instagram. They're having a great time on Instagram, scrolling through polls, engaging with people, and you know watching videos chatting away. If you want them to leave that space that they're having a great time in, you need to give them a really good reason to do this.

[00:10:45.950] - Cat
So, you need a very strong call to action. What are you offering them? What amazing thing are they going to find if they click that link. And again, it should be very clear, concise, this is what you're going to get if you click my link when they click that link.

[00:11:06.270] - Cat
So, try not to have it just going to your blog.

[00:11:12.270] - Cat
You're directing them to something specific, so they know what they're going to get. Make sure that that link goes to that page. Or if you're using something like link tree. And again, don't use link tree if you've got a blog. Create your own page on your blog that's like link tree.

[00:11:29.710] - Cat
Have all your links on there. You're getting the traffic going from Instagram. If you ever need to run ads later, that's extra data that you've got from there. So, do try and keep this on your own web page. But what your call to action on Instagram here?

[00:11:45.950] - Cat
That needs to be the top link. If people click on it and they have to start looking for something, again, they're either going to get distracted and forget why they're on there. Or they're going to get bored, or they're going to go down a rabbit hole of searching something else, so make it very very easy call to action. The first link they see, the first thing that they see is relevant to what that call to action is.

[00:12:16.650] - Cat
Okay. So, we're going to move on to hashtags. Now first of all, I'm curious currently, how many hashtags do you use right now? And I'm asking because there's so many schools of thought on this, everyone does different. So, let me know what you use. And I'm going to have a little bit of a nosy at those comments and see what you're doing.

[00:12:43.510] - Cat
But I'll answer the question for you of how many hashtags should you use and you're going to love this answer. It depends. Okay. The reason it depends is everyone's account is different. Everyone's content is different.

[00:13:00.380] - Cat
Even if you're in the same niche as someone else. Your content is different. So, the way hashtags work is, they reflect what the content is. They reflect whether people are engaging with those hashtags. And then from there, your content gets shown under those hashtags.

[00:13:20.710] - Cat
Now, for some people's accounts, using all 30 hashtags gets some great visibility and it works really well with their content. Other people's accounts around ten hashtags works brilliantly for their content. You might have seen, so I'm recording this in November. You might have seen that.

[00:13:44.990] - Cat
There's a big thing being said quite recently that you should only use three or four hashtags. Now, the context for that is that was the Instagram Creators account. And the people that are putting content on there are creators, but they're the creators have hundreds of thousands of followers, millions of followers already established brands already very visible. And they're probably not needing that reach from the hashtags. They are probably, even if they're using only four hashtags, they're probably getting into top posts under those four hashtags. They don't need to like widen the net.

[00:14:27.630] - Cat
So, to speak.

[00:14:29.110] - Cat
So, you can't say that what an account with a million followers, very engaged followers and what they do should be the same for your account if you've got 500 followers, for example. So, every account is different. So you do need to experiment with how many hashtags you use. One thing that we can actually really do with our hashtags, though, is apply the Goldilocks principle.

[00:14:56.060] - Cat
So, if you might remember how Goldilocks, she didn't want anything too big or too small. And that's kind of a blanket rule we can add with hashtags. Now every account is different. This isn't going to be exactly the same for every account. But as a general rule, you don't want to be using huge hashtags. And by huge, I mean that they've been used like millions of times, and you don't want to be using tiny hashtags either.

[00:15:23.780] - Cat
And by tiny I mean like two or 3000 times. If you look at the image just above my head here. I've got Travel Cambodia and you can see that's been used 96.1 thousand times. That's what I mean by the size, how many times the hashtag has been used. The reason that we don't want to use huge hashtags is because when we make a post on the hashtag providing the hashtag is still active, then there's hundreds of other people making a post at the same time. And your post will just drop off the end of the hashtag feed.

[00:16:04.570] - Cat
You can test it out.

[00:16:06.030] - Cat
Use travel. Look at what is at the top of the feed. Give it 5 seconds, refresh your phone and that hashtag will have gone down. It will have vanished. So, you don't want to be using hashtags that are too big and hashtags which are too small.

[00:16:23.850] - Cat
You might struggle to get any attraction on because it might mean that nobody is viewing those hashtags unless you are in a very specific, very tight niche. And you know that like all your target audience are using engaging on those hashtags. Then avoid using too small ones. As a general rule, you want to be using hashtags between about 50,000 and 200,000 for most of your hashtags. Some going up to 500,000 maybe and any between 500,000, a million, one or two at the absolute most. But keep most of your hashtags between about 200 and 500 thousand.

[00:17:08.530] - Cat
Also do make sure that the hashtags that you're using, you don't use the same hashtag on all of your post, back to back. You do mix them up. You make sure that you're using hashtags which are relevant to that specific post, that specific content. And also that your hashtags.

[00:17:30.590] - Cat
They're not just on the industry hashtags, but they're actually hashtags that your target audience will be looking for and searching and wanting to use themselves.

[00:17:43.250] - Cat
So, one last thing that I want you to be really careful about is that you're not using banned hashtags. Now, if you use a banned hashtag, you will get zero reach and the hashtags on that post. It can also affect your trust rating with Instagram, you might struggle to get reach in the future, too. So, a banned hashtag, it's usually quite often an innocent hashtag, but for some reason it's been used for people for nefarious reasons.

[00:18:16.850] - Cat
Inappropriate content. Occasionally, the hashtags can get hijacked in certain situations like join terrorist attacks and things like that. So, banned hashtags can change all the time. Easter was banned one year, and that has been okay over years. So, banned hashtags constantly change.

[00:18:40.730] - Cat
Keep an eye on your insights. So, assuming that you have a business or a creative account, which you absolutely should have, so you can get access to all your insights. Look in your insights under posts. See how many views you get under hashtags. If you are not getting any views under your hashtags, it's possible that you've used a banned hashtag. You might just be using an effective hashtags, but maybe you've used a banned hashtag.

[00:19:12.770] - Cat
Okay, so what is a banned hashtag? Got two examples here. If you look at logo design and you can see, so from this search, logo design just hasn't come up in the search. You can't even attempt to try and use the hashtag logo design. Kind of hidden behind my head.

[00:19:35.610] - Cat
But also if you look at beauty blogger that comes up with a warning that posts are being hidden under that hashtag because of content that's been shared under it. So that's how you can tell if a hashtag has been banned or not. You can Google and various lists will come up with banned hashtags. But as I say, it's a constantly changing list. This list changes all the time.

[00:20:05.710] - Cat
Here are some hashtags that as of me making this presentation are currently banned. They always make me sad for any Harry Potter fans out there. You will understand why, but yeah, some of them are quite surprising to people. Did any of these surprise you? Let me know in the comments.

[00:20:29.730] - Cat
Which one surprised you the most? I'll just quickly have a look there. Yeah. Okay. To me.

[00:20:39.440] - Cat
Desk. I find desk the most surprising.

[00:20:44.390] - Cat
Alright. So, what we're going to look at now is we're going to look at the different neighborhoods of Instagram. So, what do I mean by this? I mean, the different content types on Instagram, what they are? When you should be using them? Why you should be using them?

[00:21:02.810] - Cat
So, you've got the original. You've got feed post. And feed post is the square on your feed. And it can be an image. It can be a video. It can be a carousel.

[00:21:16.670] - Cat
These are still great folder to have. These are still brilliant for reaching people. And the different types of people do have different functions. For example, carousels typically don't do very well under hashtags. But they do really well under engagement, partly because with the carousel, you're able to deliver quite a lot of information in a very digestible way. People will scroll through them people are staying on that profile longer.

[00:21:51.950] - Cat
All of these things help your reach and people are more likely to engage on them. But also with a carousel post, you get two shots at being seen. So, what Instagram will do is it will show that first screen of the carousel and then it will show the second screen of the carousel later on. So, you get two for the price of one. If you're making a Carousel post. You can also share short form videos in your feed.

[00:22:26.510] - Cat
You may or may not be able to share your IGTV video to your feed. At the moment, IGTV is being transitioned to a new tab along with Reels. So, some people have this new tab, some people don't. But if you don't have it now, it's coming soon, so I'll talk about that separately.

[00:22:50.930] - Cat
So, for now, we're thinking of single image post, video posts or carousel posts. Now you might have seen the big rumor going around that Instagram is no longer a photo sharing app. I just want to quickly challenge this up, address this, sorry. So, Adam Mosseri said this, the head of Instagram, in one of his live videos. Now that guy, trust me, the amount of times you say something in a live video and then comes back and corrects it later is unbelievable.

[00:23:25.210] - Cat
He really should think before he speaks because he causes all this drama. But yeah, he said in a live video that Instagram is no longer a photo sharing app. He meant Instagram is no longer just a photo sharing app. He has since been back on Instagram, on Twitter, in his lives, even in his feed, saying that photos still images will always have a place on Instagram as far as he can foresee. And if you look at his own feed as well, he's sharing photos half a time too, so he's still on board for that.

[00:24:01.750] - Cat
So, don't worry. If you're not all about the video, you are all about the still images or the beautiful graphic creations. They still very much have a home on Instagram today.

[00:24:16.310] - Cat
Now reels are the new cool kid on the block. And Reels can be brilliant for getting reach. The downside with this is that it doesn't necessarily reach your target audience. Now the targeting on reels is becoming more focused. They now appear under hashtags under their own tab. We are starting to get more analytics for reels, so we are starting to be able to use reels more strategically to reach a target audience.

[00:24:48.590] - Cat
But it still comes down to factors of what music is played in the reel, whether the reel is entertaining rather than whether you've got keywords in there, whether you're using hashtags in there. So, if you are creating reels and you enjoy creating reels, fantastic. They have a huge possibility for reach. Make sure within those reels, though, that the content you are creating is to reach your target audience. You're not just creating them for the sake of going viral. Because if you end up going viral with the wrong audiences, you might get a lot of followers.

[00:25:26.990] - Cat
But if they're not your target audience, they're not going to relate to your content.

[00:25:31.780] - Cat
They're not going to be interested in your blog and then that actually ends up harming your account because you have people following your account that aren't interested in your content. So, make sure if you're using reels that the content in those reels is aligned with who you are, what your content is about and what your target audience will respond to. And then when you do go viral with a reel, you're reaching the right audience.

[00:26:00.870] - Cat
So, stories are absolutely something else that you want to be doing on Instagram. Now. They don't reach new people. You don't ever get new followers from stories unless someone happens to have shared one of your stories and someone tracks you down from there. But as a general rule, your stories are for your current audience.

[00:26:23.190] - Cat
But your stories a way you get to show up several times a day and you really get to be you. Your audience can really get to know who you are from stories. So, you do want to be using stories if you're comfortable and try and push yourself if you're not. You want to be on camera.

[00:26:41.390] - Cat
You want to be visible even images, videos. Let people get to know the real you in stories. And try and post several times a day, and you want to spread them out throughout the day. So, for example, every time you post a new story, it puts you to the front of the queue. So, you want to be creating new story, new story, new story, morning, lunch, evening, or you know in the morning spread them out. So, each time you go back to the front of the queue and you want really personable relatable content in your stories.

[00:27:19.950] - Cat
Live videos can also be great. For one reason, a live video, it will send a notification to all your followers who are online at that point that you've gone live. And people are quite often nosy. There's a very good chance that people are going to come and want to check out what you are doing. Have a little bit of a nosy. Check out that live.

[00:27:43.610] - Cat
So, live videos are great, really brilliant way as well for allowing your audience to get to know you. And what you can do with the live video is you can then share that as an IGTV video. You can make sure you've got in your settings, auto captions are generated and then you've got a captioned video that you can put straight onto your either main feed or your video feed depending on where you are with your account right now. And again, they can be a great way of giving a big value, really showing expertise to your audience.

[00:28:21.870] - Cat
So, I hope you found this useful. And what I want you to take away from this is can you optimize your bio.

[00:28:31.410] - Cat
Make sure your bio is discoverable. Make sure people are going to want to follow you from your bio and take that call to action. Build yourself a hashtag bank 50 to 200 thousand. Focus on those hashtags. Make sure you're not using any banned hashtags and then create a content plan around your needs.

[00:28:53.680] - Cat
