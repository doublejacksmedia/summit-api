[00:00:09.550] - Liz Stapleton, Summit Host
All right, guys, I'm really excited to be here with Alisa from Tailwind, so thank you so much for joining me.

[00:00:15.190] - Alisa Meredith, tailwindapp.com
Yeah, I'm thrilled to be here.

[00:00:16.810] - Liz
Yeah. For anyone that doesn't know you and your background, would you mind just sharing a little bit so they know where you're coming from as we talk Pinterest today?

[00:00:24.320] - Alisa
Of course. Of course. I have been going for three and a half years as a Pinterest product specialist and manager there. And prior to that, I have run marketing agencies and just ended up specializing more and more towards Pinterest advertising. And I'm just a big believer in Pinterest marketing in businesses. And bloggers have a huge opportunity as well.

[00:00:49.780] - Liz
Yeah, because Pinterest wouldn't exist without content creators.

[00:00:53.080] - Alisa
Yes. Exactly.

[00:00:56.040] - Liz
Okay. So, I feel like people start learning about Pinterest, and they there's a gazillion experts out there telling them to do a gazillion different things. You need multiple pins. It all needs to match. It doesn't need to match. You need to pin this many times a day. No, it's actually this many times at. What do they actually need to do? What could they maybe take off their plate? What should be the focus I guess?

[00:01:22.620] - Alisa
You bring up a good point. And I think a lot of those rules happen because well-meaning teachers want to give people a place to start, right? Yeah. There's also that 80, 20, 80 percent of other people find 10, 20 percent of your own, that it's not the other way around. Yeah. Or the other way around. Right. It's the thing that was made up, I think, to help people, because we like we like we like absolutes.

[00:01:46.830] - Alisa
And that was just a place for people to start. But I think to get beyond that and think about your content, right. Is all about you and your content. There is no reason to feel like, I need to be a professional curator of content. And I don't want it to look like I'm only promoting my own stuff. That's not a consideration on Pinterest to . The biggest benefit is going to come from sharing your own content. And a lot of times people are very generous and they want to support their friends and others and maybe they want to save something for themselves to read later. But the concentration should be on your own. So, just get that in mind first. That can be helpful.

[00:02:27.990] - Liz
Yeah, because when I think about I feel bloggers sometimes forget because they use Pinterest, so differently from the average user. And so when you actually go and Pinterest to look for something, you think about how you're using it in terms of does it matter? Are you looking at the profile and saying they're only publishing their content? [laughs] I don't.

[00:02:47.880] - Alisa
You know, well and too, now that the business profiles are a little bit different when you go to someone's profile, Pinterest has arranged it. So, what you see is, first of all, pins that a creator has made right. You have to go to a different view to see anything they say is of anybody else's. So, Pinterest is really giving you the green light to focus on your own content. They want you to get the credit for your content.

[00:03:15.090] - Liz
Yes, and then I mean, 2020 was the year of "We need fresh pins." That seems to be going back a little bit, just like hashtags did a couple of years ago in 2021. So, what is sort of your stance on the fresh pin or pin design strategy?

[00:03:33.950] - Alisa
So, when it was first apparent that what Pinterest when I was fresh pins, there was an understanding that that means new images for all of us. But it has been updated, and what they really want is fresh ideas. They want fresh content, which means contents on site. So, they want a new blog post. They want a new product. They want a new idea. They want a page.

[00:04:02.160] - Alisa
Pinterest put out some videos somewhere on YouTube, which were really quite revealing, a little bit funny. There was one it's about bananas and it's a message to creators. And it says, "One point four million people are searching for banana ideas. So, we want your banana ideas, but not banana bread like we have those." So, what they show, like banana sushi and all these kind of beautiful, different things. There's no fish at all which is funny. But they did that also with. Fashion, I think, in green, that had a large search volume, but were just overrun with duplicates.

[00:04:48.490] - Liz
With one thing.

[00:04:48.760] - Alisa
Yeah, yeah, I would agree it was we don't need any more succulents. So the key is really trying to find a brand new idea. And so that's tough, right. Because what takes most of our time in marketing is creating content.

[00:05:05.390] - Liz
Yes, but. That's what's going to work, right, and that's what we're finding as we look at the pin that are going out the very first time you are elbows out, it's often going to get the most engagement per person. It doesn't mean that you can never share the pin again, because we do see that those still will create engagement and will drive traffic as well.

[00:05:31.120] - Alisa
But something that we've encouraged a bit is to think about the content that you have in the ways you could create new ideas from your own content. So it's not a fresh pin in the sense of how Pinterest would describe it. To them that's like a brand new URL right.

[00:05:48.350] - Liz
Yeah.

[00:05:48.430] - Alisa
Right out the gate. And we're not talking about taking your blog posts and changing up the URL so you can pin it again.

[00:05:55.970] - Liz
We have a whole broken link having to read, don't that.

[00:05:59.230] - Alisa
No, it's legitimately a new piece of content that they really want.

[00:06:03.990] - Liz
Yes.

[00:06:04.510] - Alisa
But you can have some benefits by thinking about your idea, your product, whatever it is on that page, and thinking about it in a different context. So, for example, I use this awful lot, because I just saw randomly on Pinterest when I was looking for an example, is a Happy Harvest, has this garden cherry bourbon smash [inaudible 00:06:27]  beautiful pin of course. So, let's say you have a piece of content like that. You can present it just as it is the garden cherry bourbon smash. But you can also think about, all right, let's think about some kind of context that would be a little bit niche that we can frame around this. So, that about. All right. What if I know there are people out there who are really into bourbon, right. So, you can frame it as the next big bourbon cocktail or somebody planning a wedding like the signature wedding cocktail of 20 to one.

[00:07:08.020] - Alisa
So, think about these different ways. You can present this information that you have and create a new pin for that. What you do not want to be creating two dozen pins for the same piece of content and then have it show up in the same search.

[00:07:22.830] - Liz
Yeah, that's not a whole lot of good.

[00:07:25.320] - Alisa
That's annoying, right? So you may get rewarded for spam, it just it's not a good user experience and it's a. One simple rule is always going to be think about what Pinterest what they wants. They want new, they want fresh,  they actually want quality. Any time you can give them that, they're going to do great.

[00:07:43.890] - Liz
Yes, so then when it comes to coming up with new ideas, I guess I know this has been released in the last year or so, Pinterest has a trends like go to Trends. Pinterest.com will be a helpful place to start. [laughs] It's awesome. And so few people know about it. What are some other ways you could get find those new ideas or come up with anything? Because it is kind of hard to sit there and be like, here's a topic. It's kind of like staring at a blank page [laughs].

[00:08:15.150] - Alisa
You're right. But I would start at Trends.Pinterest.com and look at what's trending this week and that have the major industries and the categories. There's probably something there. If you don't see that there, enter in your search term and then related terms and see what's trending right now or if you're planning ahead. All the trends is amazing.

[00:08:38.290] - Alisa
Other things we look at is Pinterest 100 from. Last year, they made ten overall predictions, and all but two of them were proved right. So, what they're doing is looking at what they think will be trending this year. And the ones I missed last year were. Something like travel like an airport-

[00:09:03.000] - Liz
They couldn't predict.

[00:09:05.880] - Alisa
Yes. And the other was balance like mind, body, balance, something like that, we were all a mess.

[00:09:14.830] - Liz
Yes.

[00:09:14.950] - Alisa
But everything else I got right then some things are a little far out, like I didn't even know what they're talking about, but that's life these days. So, check out the Pinterest 100, they have it so you can sort it by your audience; so, by generation basically. And you can sort of by your industry. And then you can find out like what what's going to be possibly trending.

[00:09:36.040] - Liz
Okay.

[00:09:36.490] - Alisa
Another way is every month Tailend puts out these toolkit templates. So, we also have them built into our product. So, we have something called Tailend Create, which is new as of end of October, where you can put in your URL, it pulls out the title of your page, pulls in your images and then gives you like literally thousands of options to choose from to then tweak and just go right up there. There are different ways you can filter the designs and one of the ways is to look for trending content for that month.

[00:10:12.980] - Alisa
Okay, so if you looked for December, you would get Widgery, you would get Christmas, you would get the big game, because even though Super Bowl is for a month or something, it's going to show you what you should be thinking about pitting right now, in preparation for what's about to take off.

[00:10:33.670] - Liz
Yeah, because unlike other platforms on Pinterest, you almost want to be a couple of months ahead. So, that your pin has time to get traction; when it actually is trending that's where your pin will pop-up.

[00:10:48.520] - Alisa
Exactly. And that's why we use we use a trends tool to figure that out. And we also use the Pinterest Possibility Planner, which shows when those things start to heat up.

[00:10:57.420] - Liz
Okay. Sorry I make notes.

[00:11:04.060] - Alisa
No. Okay,

[00:11:04.510] - Liz
`So, in case anyone doesn't know, obviously the Tailwind Create is inside Tailwind. I was one of the early beta testers of it, it is pretty cool that all the things you do with it. Where would they find the Pinterest 100 and the possibility planner?

[00:11:22.490] - Alisa
See, I was just looking at that.

[00:11:24.460] - Liz
So, they know.

[00:11:26.480] - Alisa
I mean, obviously you could Google it. Yeah, it's. The other one is Pinterest possibilities, that one's a good one.

[00:11:40.230] - Liz
okay.

[00:11:40.350] - Alisa
Pinterest Predict.com.

[00:11:43.790] - Liz
Okay, Pinterest Predicts.com. Okay, so it's a great place. That's a great place to start. Get your ideas, figure out what content you're going to be creating. Once you've created content, then you're looking at creating a pen. And obviously eye-catching. Does it need to all be kind of branded? Does it. Does it matter. Do you think. What...?

[00:12:07.370] - Alisa
Yeah. Yeah. So, I think this is kind of a it's going to be a personal decision for everybody, but yes, definitely visually appealing. So, we make it fold. Also here is a little tip, when you're thinking about your keywords and you're going to create content that involves a keyword research that keyword. Chances are you're going to see one dominant color. So, if you search dinner recipes, everything is like this brown gold color and it all melts together. The only one I thought that stood out at all had this big, bright blue banner. Do that. Search for your keyword and then do something to it.

[00:12:44.120] - Alisa
Again, we talked about original ideas, so making it look cool in your pin,  but also the attitude. Pinterest is a lot of people happy place. They want to go there to be inspired and to feel good about themselves and their lives and feel positive and optimistic. So, always, always keeping that in mind. They also want it to be relevant. So make sure that you're thinking about what's going on in the world today.

[00:13:13.310] - Alisa
It's probably not going to do great with a birthday party with 50 kids on top of each other with their hands in their face. That is scary to us right now. So, just think about the context of where you live. Like this is real life here on Pinterest. So, just be aware of what people are feeling and thinking, what would be attractive to them and what would not. Also, keeping it actionable and making sure they know what you want them to do with it. And that comes down to part of that being the branding. So, if you have, let's say, that photo of a beautiful chair and that's it. Someone might say, it's nice eye-candy, but someone who is actually shopping would have no idea that this is something I could go buy if you don't put your brand name on it. So, you definitely do want to brand your Pinterest. Pinterest is great for brand awareness because 97% of the searches there are unbranded, which means they're not already decided that they're going to buy a world market share. They may be very open to your share. Yeah, but make sure they recognize the brand. Yeah, it's your share and it's much more likely for them to convert if there is some branding on pin.

[00:14:29.900] - Liz
Always, at least the site name, I think. The colors don't always have to be your brand colors in my mind, right?

[00:14:35.750] - Alisa
Yeah, exactly. And that's the thing. People will say, well, "I want to keep everything consistent because of branding." And you know, that's fine. That's your choice. But what is more important to you? Is it the brand strict brand awareness and that slight recognition or is it traffic and sales? Because if it's traffic and sales, you probably want to be a little more flexible, especially on Pinterest, especially if you're starting out what is style is going to work and just be willing to try things.

[00:15:05.150] - Liz
Yeah, and Pinterest has been really great in terms of keeping the sizing the same of what they want the two by three ratio for. While people are doing what were called giraffe pins that are super long, but it seems that it's really just do the two by three don't do slightly taller, just do two buy three. Is that accurate?

[00:15:22.700] - Alisa
Two by three that's the standard. And they want 1000 by 1500 just to make sure the revolution is good. You can go up to 1000 by 2100 without getting cut off and some times  they do perform really well.

[00:15:37.010] - Liz
Okay.

[00:15:37.170] - Alisa
But you would not go wrong with the two to three.

[00:15:41.750] - Liz
Don't be doing landscape, that's for sure.

[00:15:43.750] - Alisa
Definitely not. You're just taking up more room with that. Talking about the branding, so I had Kristy Hill, a pretty well-known blogger on our Facebook live months ago. And she was telling us that she created some pins with Tailend free. And even though they weren't really her style, they worked with the brand and they were some of her top performing things at that time. So, you know, if you're willing to just try a little something different, you never know.

[00:16:17.240] - Liz
Yeah. Can we talk a little bit about pin type? Because there's just an image pin, there's video pins and anime pins which are considered video pins, but are different in terms of creation. They have the new story pin that I think we all want to die out, but you can't add a link to it.

[00:16:40.040] - Alisa
You cannot.

[00:16:40.820] - Liz
So, really not good for content creators. But like video versus image, what?

[00:16:50.790] - Alisa
So video pins, tend to be really well in the feed because that motion will catch your eye and so that results in a lot of video patterns that are really just a static pin with maybe a moving element on it. Right. So, maybe that'll catch people's eyes. Maybe not. But it doesn't really add a lot to the experience just to have a floating part and whatever. What what is more useful on Pinterest and where I see the engagement happening of course, engagement is not a vanity metric on Pinterest. Engagement tells Pinterest that, "Hey, this is good, good content. I should distribute it more, especially if your followers who are engaging." That's really what you want. So, what I'm seeing gets more engagement is a pin, a video that shows how to do something.

[00:17:41.760] - Alisa
So, an example I like to use is a DIY lava lamp. And this, just like the cover of it, is just looks like a regular pin, but then it's just a little boy at a kitchen table like no fancy anything, just moms taking a video of a kid making a lava lamp.

[00:18:01.290] - Liz
Yeah.

[00:18:01.590] - Alisa
And it it's a tremendous amount of engagement. So to me, if you can take video, it does not have to be fancy. We have I mean, there are lots of fancy ones out there that show how to make a recipe or, you know, showing the hands. It doesn't have to be fancy to do lot on Pinterest, which I think is wonderful because I think video can be very intimidating. I think one of the challenges with Pinterest video is that it's not always easy to find the link...

[00:18:34.800] - Liz
Unless it's a promoted.

[00:18:36.300] - Alisa
Yeah, yeah, yeah. So, that's a little tricky, but I still think videos are worth doing. So, you did mention there are gift pins, but I don't think those are worth the effort personally. There are carousels which are kind of like story accounts, but they never worked really well for me anyway. I don't why [laughs]. You mentioned the story pins- yeah there are no links out there. Like any time a new feature goes out, it's a good idea to try it if you can because more engagement on that, it's probably going to lift up your other content from that site.

[00:19:17.410] - Liz
Yeah.

[00:19:17.710] - Alisa
So, even though you're not getting the traffic from it, you may get followers who are going to engage with your feature content and then go over from there. It's worth a try, but I mean, story brands-

[00:19:31.080] - Liz
Don't rely on it.

[00:19:32.670] - Alisa
Don't rely on it for traffic. Certainly, certainly not. But I would definitely give them a try.

[00:19:38.400] - Alisa
At the Pinterest Prater's festival a few months back, it was all about the story, and it was all about we think you deserve more than a double tap. We want to connect you with pinners. And that's something, it's a very different direction for Pinterest. It'll be interesting to see how users respond to that. Yeah, yeah. I think they use them, but make sure you give a call to action to let them know where to go to find more. It  is frustrating when you get to the end of some great idea and you want more and there's no link.

[00:20:12.910] - Liz
Yeah. I feel like it kind of reminds me of when they tried to do like communities or something a couple of years back.

[00:20:20.460] - Alisa
Yes.

[00:20:20.690] - Liz
That weren't was like, Okay, well, everybody was like, "I'm going to claim a community. So, I have it." But kind of didn't pan out. Okay. And the other question I want to talk to you about is focusing more on your own words or on group words. As long as their quality group  words. I'm not saying, you know, I feel like I got to rely on- there's some- don't do the everything group or just because a lot of people on it. But niche specific quality group boards versus your own boards and sort of tending to them. Or if you should look at them.

[00:20:56.010] - Alisa
Yeah. In general, your on boards. And the reason for that is that. Pinterest created group boards for people to actually collaborate on, right? But what marketers figured out, as we always do, is that when you share a pin to a group board your pin will likely be shown to the followers of all the members in that group board. It seems like exponential reach. Well, they figured out what we figured out and they said, nope, it's not going to work that way anymore. So, you can't rely on group boards for increased distribution just because you put your pin in there.

[00:21:30.980] - Alisa
Now, if you actually have a group board where people do collaborate and they find your content interesting, they want to share it with your audience and they're actually doing that. That's great [laughs]. Like do that. But if that's not the case, don't.

[00:21:46.460] - Alisa
One of the ways that you can figure out what is going on, like which ones are working for you, Pinterest Analytics has board analytics and so does Tailend. So, you can go in there and see how is this group board doing and then you can click through to see how is my content doing. And you can filter it by date. So, you can see was it doing a couple of years ago and now it's terrible or should I keep using it.  But definitely look. But generally it's zero all the time.

[00:22:20.000] - Liz
Okay. And then In terms of new ideas and fresh content, like do you find that people that are kind of regularly creating new boards on their profile, that it makes a difference or kind of what you set up with, the new boards?

[00:22:34.780] - Alisa
Oh, that's not something I've analyzed. But your boards also need to be centered around your content. So, the reason I would create a new board is if I started writing about a different topic. And then, yeah, even if I only had a couple pins for it, I would create that board. Because really, when you share your content at that first time, it needs to go to a very relevant board, so that Pinterest will get that signal. Okay. This is about. I don't know sterling silver teaspoons as opposed to, let's say you're going to write more about that. You're not just going to put it on your kitchen stuff board, you want it to be more specific. And that might be a little too specific honestly, unless you're going to put a new category on your blog or in product category.

[00:23:23.090] - Liz
Okay, yeah. So, I think I just wanted to kind of touch on that because it can be when you're doing all those new ideas, it doesn't mean you do everything [laughs] okay. So, any final things you think people need to need to know about Pinterest in 2021?

[00:23:36.620] - Alisa
I think just as always, think about what they want for their users. And when you hear these rules or these magical formulas that work, take it with a grain of salt, because there are a lot of kind of questionable tactics out there, so if it feels a little bit shaky, it probably is then just don't do it. Just honestly create great content for your readers. And then when you share it on Pinterest, it should do well.

[00:24:17.510] - Liz
Yeah. Okay, great. Thank you so much for this information. I know. I actually learned a couple of new things, even though I've been on Pinterest for years. I know you have something for our attendees. Can you tell us a little bit about it? 

[00:24:31.380] - Alisa
Yeah. So, a couple things. One is a new webinar, The Everything Pinterest webinars, what we've nicknamed it. But basically it's everything you need to know to succeed on Pinterest. And it is new. It is updated. It's an hour long. So, it's really like everything [laughs]. So, there's that. And then if you use lots of affiliate links to sign up for, you get a month free. So, if you try it, there's no credit card required. You can try out the scheduling. You can create with the scheduling. Yeah, try it out.

[00:25:06.980] - Liz
Awesome. Alisa, Thank you so much. Hope I said your name right just then [laughs].

[00:25:15.890] - Alisa
You did.

[00:25:16.070] - Liz
Yeah. I was trying to remember how to say it. I think I did. Thank you again. I hope you have a great rest of your day. Catch you at the next session. I appreciate it.

[00:25:24.270] - Alisa
All right. Thank you.
