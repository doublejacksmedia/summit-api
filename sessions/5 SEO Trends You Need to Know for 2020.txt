Liz Stapleton [00:00:00]:
Guys, I'm really excited for this session with Ben from, the cofounder of DollarSprout, who's gonna be talking some SEO tips. Welcome, Ben. Thank you so much for doing this.

Ben Huber [00:00:08]:
Yes. Thank you for having me, Liz. I appreciate you taking the time to chat a little bit of SEO with me tonight.

Liz Stapleton [00:00:14]:
Yeah. Because, I mean, SEO is one of those things that when you start blogging, you don't necessarily know a lot about it, but you quickly realize that it's something you need to know more about.

Ben Huber [00:00:23]:
Mhmm.

Liz Stapleton [00:00:24]:
You know, and then and then you start digging into it, and it can be extremely overwhelming. So why don't you give us kind of the highlights of what you're gonna cover?

Ben Huber [00:00:32]:
Yeah. Sure. So like you said, I mean, I think it's one of those things where we all, you know, get into blogging. We're we're all gung ho about getting started, and we we kind of learn the basics of creating content and then we begin to learn there's this whole other side of of marketing your content. So it's like, if you build it, they may or may not come. And the may or may not come turns into how do I actually get them to come. And I think that, obviously, there's so many different strategies we can use, you know, for traffic acquisition, SEO being one of them. If you've have come from a background or you've done, like, paid media acquisition, so you're paying for people to come to your site or you just rock on Pinterest or you do YouTube.

Ben Huber [00:01:10]:
But for us and for, you know, what we've done on DollarSprout, a lot of our successes has come from search. We we basically take a reader's question and we we try to answer it with our content. And so as you, you know, kind of get further into your blogging journey, I think that part of being a well rounded Blogger, you know, kind of just means it's it's a component of of traffic acquisition. I need to learn the strategy and I and at at some point, I'm gonna try to master it. And I think for us, that's something that we've done done a good job doing. And so, you know, one of the things about search or search algorithms in general is that they're ever changing, and I think that that is something that a lot of, you know, bloggers struggle with is it's frustrating, you know, to see

Liz Stapleton [00:01:50]:
You finally get a handle on something and then the the sand shifts beneath you.

Ben Huber [00:01:54]:
Yep. Yep. And another and then another instances, I think that's something a lot of bloggers struggle with is they learn something and then they don't ever evolve. I think that, you know, they they learned it this way and they're stubborn and they don't wanna change. And so something that I really, you know, feel strongly about is is just being open minded and I think, like, you you learn Let's

Liz Stapleton [00:02:12]:
go with your strategy.

Ben Huber [00:02:13]:
Yep. Exactly. And I think that, you know, especially in this upcoming year, just how and taking a look back in 2019, just how often they're changing their algorithm, you really do have to, like, kind of stay abreast of of what's changing and what are they really trying, you know, to to get at. What do they how are they improving the quality of their search algorithms? And so the, you know, the thing that I wanna talk about is, you know or at least the 5 things I really wanna cover in my presentation are are ways that you can stay on top of those changes, and, like and then that's it's one of those things where you're trying to stay on top of them, and then further furthermore, you're trying to kind of guess what they're where they're going in the new year. And so what I did was I kind of took a step back and I said, Right, what, you know, how are they changing? What are what are they telling us? And then, you know, what what's kind of implied. And so the 5 things that I really wanna, you know, impress upon people, especially Blogger's that are looking into SEO, are, I guess, are just one of a few things. 1, you know, Google is looking into kind of the uniqueness of your Right. That was, like, the first, you know, point that I really wanna harp on.

Ben Huber [00:03:19]:
Just building trust, so they trust you. They they want, you know, to send readers to your site, how to build relevant content, how we can optimize our site to to get Google to send people there, and then providing a good user experience once they're there. So it's kind of this continuum of of SEO in the sense that you wanna to not only optimize your site, but then provide a good user experience when you get there. So that's kind of that that's shifting how, you know, Google perceives that user experience to be. It has shifted a lot in 2019 and it's going to shift even further in 2020. And so part of our, you know, my work for this presentation was was figuring out where they wanna go and how we can optimize our sites better for the future. So

Liz Stapleton [00:04:01]:
Yeah. I'm I'm excited to dive into this. I think it's gonna mesh really well with all the other sessions we've got. We've got a lot of sessions on content creation in terms of storytelling.

Ben Huber [00:04:11]:
Sure. You know,

Liz Stapleton [00:04:11]:
that's that's what makes it unique, because anyone can write a post of 70 side hustles or whatever. It's how do you inject uniqueness into that that's gonna make it stand out, you know, and and and your site in general. So, yeah. So I'm excited. Let's let's get to it.

Ben Huber [00:04:26]:
Sure. Thanks for being patient with me as I kinda switch gears here into actual presentation mode. I'm really excited to spend a few minutes today talking about my personal favorite blogging topic, which is SEO, and more specifically, how changes in SEO in 2019 kind of impact our best practice for 2020. So what I've done is I've put together a slide deck of about 20 slides or so that highlight 5 of the biggest changes that occurred in 2019 and how we can kind of interpret those changes and use the information we gathered from them to kind of shape best practice for 2020. So if you're a beginner blogger, you're probably gonna get a ton of value out of this. If you're an intermediate blogger and even advanced blogger, there's still a lot here that I think that you're gonna be able to take away from it and kind of apply again to your content marketing strategy moving forward. So what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna open up the presentation here. I'm actually gonna minimize myself off this screen, and I'm gonna go through the slides here starting now.

Ben Huber [00:05:22]:
Alright. So I've got my presentation open here, and I'm gonna head to this first slide. And I wanted to start everything off by talking a little bit about the state of search and why it's still meaningful and relevant as a part of our content marketing strategy, especially for a lot of bloggers that start kind of on the social side of things and kind of learn about SEO and aren't aren't really sure what it is or why it's important. I think that a few of these statistics will kind of highlight just how dominant it is in our in our online marketing experience. And so, again, for the first tidbit on here, it might surprise some of you to know that 51% of all web traffic starts with an organic search, which is a fairly high number when you kind of consider the emergence of social into the scene over the last 10 years or so. I think that I think smartphones kind of appeared in the 2,009 range. And then since then, they've kind of dominated a lot of the marketing headlines that we've seen. But again, 51% of of all web experiences start with organic searches still.

Ben Huber [00:06:24]:
So a huge market, in terms of finding your ideal readers. That kind of brings me to my second point, is that organic search is still by far the best way to really hone in on your ideal reader. If you are writing a piece of content that solves their problem or is even if it's entertainment value, whatever the case may be, you are kind of reaching your ideal avatar because they have already expressed interest in the topic that you're writing on. So if you are appealing to customers on search, you might be at the mercy of the news feed and hoping that they match the intent of a person on the news feed to your content, whereas with search, they have already told Google that they're interested in your content, and now they're matching it to you. So if you are looking for people that are lukewarm or even warm when it comes to a marketing or funnel perspective, these readers are are already there. There doesn't take much to introduce them to your brand and and kind of adopt them into your audience. So organic search is a really powerful tool for attracting your your ideal avatar or your ideal reader. And then last but not least, SEO is one of the few remaining free platforms for acquiring your audience and volume.

Ben Huber [00:07:39]:
So if you think about it over the last 10 years or so, there's been a little bit of a consolidation, especially amongst big tech, where companies like Facebook have been acquiring Instagram. They've acquired other smaller social platforms. And so there's this kind of consolidation amongst big tech, where there's only so many mediums for distributing your content. And so if you take a wide angle lens at it, you've got organic search. You've got organic social, which are the social platforms, you've got email marketing, and then you've got paid acquisition channels. So 4 real big ways to get people back on-site, but the vast majority of them are coming through search. So if you haven't started on SEO and you're looking for a place to get started, some of these tips are maybe more intermediate in nature, and you might need to kind of hone in on the basics. But come back to this presentation down the road because these are gonna be crucial to kind of your overall journey in search.

Ben Huber [00:08:35]:
Move to this next slide here. And, yeah, just to highlight just how quickly search changes, if you weren't already aware, and I think a lot of you probably already are just from being in the blogging circles, Google dominates the search kind of niche. And it's highlighted best by the fact that they ascertain almost 92% of all the search volume that occurs on search engines. So when you hear people say they're optimizing for Google, they're truly optimizing for SEO, it just happens to be that Google is the biggest player in our space. And that, again, is highlighted by the fact of just how frequently they're changing their search algorithms. So 9 updates a day, which is an astonishing number. They're constantly trying to tinker and improve their product, which is kind of benefits the the end reader, and webmasters just have to kind of stay a a bridge of all these changes. And then last but not least, kind of before we start to dive into the actual changes that of note in 2019, is just to kind of understand a little bit about where these companies are coming from.

Ben Huber [00:09:43]:
They're constantly trying to balance creating a better product with generating revenue. And so that kind of manifest manifests itself in a couple ways. I think with with Google specifically, you've seen the adaptation of zero click search in the last year, which is one of the bigger trends that actually didn't, highlight much in this presentation. I know that Rob Powell talks about 0 click search in his, so if you're wondering what that is and why it's so important to SEO in 2020, go ahead and review that component of his presentation. Again, 0 click search, it's it's huge, and it's really reshaping the way that webmasters practice SEO. But for the purposes of this presentation, I tried to find 5 other areas or 5 other big changes that really highlight the direction that some of these search engines, especially Google, is taking. And so just kind of a fun factoid for you guys, at their core, these mediums or these content delivery mediums are really just massive ad delivery networks. It's the easiest and the best way for them to distribute their content.

Ben Huber [00:10:47]:
And so, again, these are Right recent numbers, but Facebook, at 99.8 percent of their 55,000,000,000 in revenue, was from delivering ads from advertisers, which is kind of an astonishing figure. And Google themselves, not not exactly diversified in their revenue streams as well, 85% of of which is is ad based. I know they've gotten into the physical realm of trying to distribute physical products, like Google Home and some of these other, you know, smart devices, but they're still still haven't gotten away from their identity of a basically, an advertising network. And my last piece of advice, again, just before we get into this stuff, is if you aren't already following educational sources, it's really important, as a kind of a well rounded blogger and that's trying to maintain kind of this omnichannel presence. It's really important for you to to, 1, not get complacent, but, 2, just become, like, a lifetime learner. Learn a little bit about search every day. And I think that, you know, a year from now, if you constantly have kind of subscribed to this drip of educational content from some of these sources, you will be a much more well rounded marketer. And so definitely subscribe to some of the channels that you see there and some of the people on Twitter, especially.

Ben Huber [00:12:07]:
SEOs are very, very present on Twitter. So if you kind of just check-in daily with some of your favorite figures, you are going to just grow leaps and bounds as a marketer. Alright. Let me pull up one more slide here. And so let me hide this here. Just so I think that Right might be showing on your guys' screen. But one of the biggest changes that we have seen happen in 2019 and then this is really something that's been talked about since the early 20teens think 2010 or so Google introduced the idea of speed being, like, an actual algorithm ranking factor. And they didn't exactly confirm it then, but they have confirmed it more recently.

Ben Huber [00:12:47]:
So 2018 or so, they finally came out and said speed is super important to the user experience. We are we are going to actually start including it into our our algorithm ranking characteristics. And so that became official in July of 2018, and they Google started to share some information about the user experience and how speed impacts it. And this data all comes from that original article that they published back on the Webmaster Blogger, or think with Google back in July of 2018. But you get an idea of just how slow the user experience can be on mobile. I think right there at 22 seconds is it's kind of an astonishing figure. If you were on your desktop, you would never wait 22 seconds for a page to load. And so why are we putting our mobile users through that same experience? It's one of those things where we tend to have broadband like connections on desktop, but the rest of the world is kind of lagging behind in terms of speed on mobile.

Ben Huber [00:13:53]:
So we've got 3 gs, which is transfers data at a much slower rate than 4 gs, and now we've got 5 gs emerging. But in any instance, we just don't have the speed or the ability to download these web pages at the same rate on mobile as we do on desktop. So they have straight out come out and said that speed is an incredibly important factor when it comes to the user experience. And how that affects us as marketers is more prevalent in how quickly someone bounces from your page. So if you see you're in Google Analytics. You've got that installed, and you see your bounce rates are super high. There's so many different ways to kind of diagnose why that's occurring. But one of them, or one of the explanations beyond your content not necessarily matching what the reader anticipated was, simply put, that your website is super slow.

Ben Huber [00:14:42]:
And so you can see just how high the percentage of bounce is for slow user experiences. So as the length of time it takes to load your page increases, so from 1 to 3 or 1 to 5 or even 1 to 10 seconds, the bounce rate almost increases exponentially. So if your page is taking more than 10 seconds to load, it is your bounce rate is a 100% higher, 123% higher than it was if it only took one second to load. So people are literally just not staying around to read your content. So speed is a super important metric, not only for user experience, but also if you want your blog to be successful. I found a statistic from Cloudflare, which is one of the largest CDN networks in the entire world, that really surprised me. And that was just how poorly conversion rates, I guess, drop or just how much they drop when speed incrementally increases. So from just 2.4 seconds to 5.7 seconds, which, again, if mobile is at a 20 second time frame, that's not a long period of time.

Ben Huber [00:15:45]:
Your conversion rates are dropping an enormous percentage. So if you've got a link that advertises an affiliate at the bottom of an article and it takes more than 5 seconds for your page to load, you're you're essentially dropping the number of people that click on that link by 300% just by having a slow user experience. So speed is incredibly important to how quickly someone is able to get to your page and kind of digest the content that's on it. And then these are a little more technical for for some of you that have may have may excuse me, may have larger sites. I know that one person I've audited in the past had a coupon site. They had over 20,000 URLs. And something worth noting is that if you have a slow user experience or slow load times, you are actually hurting your ability for your new content to actually rank. So if you're just beginning and your blog only has maybe 30 posts and you have nothing else on your site, probably not much to worry about.

Ben Huber [00:16:46]:
But if you're a little more established and you're kind of on the intermediate side of things and you've got a big site, you need to kind of start thinking about how not only does a slower website provide a poor user experience, but it also impacts the rate at which Google's crawl budget is allotted to your site. And so if you're struggling and you can't figure out why some of your content isn't reaching Google's index, that's one place that you can look. And then last but not least, poor website experience or slow loading times for your brand just look bad. And so if someone has been to your site a couple times and they realize that each and every time they come it's a miserable experience, they're becoming progressively less likely to start coming back. And so 2 of the big changes, and the reason I kind of included speed into this trend or change kind of the small changes that we've noticed over 2019 is that Google is literally telling us that it's an important, you know, factor. I think that that is one of the more obvious changes that we've noted over the years, is that they've actually changed your search console to incorporate a panel here. So you can see under the Enhancements tab that they've actually included a Knowledge Panel for webmasters almost that approaches broaches speed topics. And you can see that for our particular domain, we don't have any slow URLs.

Ben Huber [00:18:14]:
But if you do, if you are fortunate enough to have one in this spot right here, you may see in the coming release of Chrome, of their browser, that Google or Chrome is going to start actually warning people when they're about to hit a slow website. And so there is nothing that dooms a user experience or dooms your website more than this badge of shame, is kind of what they're calling it, than than a reader showing up and seeing that. And then the flip side is true. They're actually rewarding or showing when a website wins or reloads faster. So you may see a green progress bar appear, kind of up here at the top, for sites that are known to have a good user experience or load quickly. And so that kind of brings me to how to know or how to identify if your website is loading slowly. And there, I've included a slide here that kind of is something that I think everyone can get a little bit out of. And even if you're a total beginner and you're just not really sure that if your site is slow, it may load fast enough to you on desktop, say 2 or 3 seconds, but you're not quite sure how well you're doing on mobile, there's a couple of quick things that you can look for to kind of clue you in to whether or not your page might be loading really slowly for your users.

Ben Huber [00:19:35]:
And so if you're using Chrome or any browser if you're not using Chrome, you may have to Google how to get to some of your dev tool options. But if you're in Chrome, you can just hit control shift I, and this little network tab is gonna pop up for you. And you can just refresh your page. And actually, there's a toggle button. I actually don't have it on the screenshot, but there's a toggle button that says disable cache. And you wanna click that and reload your page. And what you can do is you can sort this Network tab by size, and it'll show you if you have any assets on a page that might be really big and slowing down, you know, your overall user experience. And so this entire column that I have circled here, it all adds up to this figure right here.

Ben Huber [00:20:20]:
This is the transfer amount. And Right now, it's showing 500 kilobytes, which is not quite 1 megabyte. It's not about halfway to 1 megabyte. And Google has told us, just based off their massive index, that the average web page is about 2.2 megabytes. So if you think about it, it's a really easy way to kind of remember it all. The average 2.2 megabyte page takes about 22 seconds to load. And so if anything you can do to get your overall page weight below 2.2 megabytes is sure to help your reader get to your content even faster. So there's I've got a list here coming up of things that you can actually do to lower your page weight.

Ben Huber [00:21:05]:
But this is just an easy way in the dev tools to identify if you've got a really large page where problems may exist. So you can kind of get a wealth of information here. You can see that we have 33 requests, which is fairly low. You might see that you have 100 or 200 or even 5 or 800 if you're using an ad network, and that's just the number of times that a user has to basically query your server in order to get all the information they need to see the page. And so the lower that number in general, the better. But even for some of you that have higher numbers here, there's a lot that you can do to kind of expedite or speed up the process for how quickly someone can render your page. But this is just an easy way right here to see how big your page is. And for our particular dev environment right here I've got actually our test site open you can see that the pay the typical user is usually able to start seeing our content here within the first one second, which is really important because it shows the reader that the page is loading.

Ben Huber [00:22:08]:
And I've got another slide here that has 2 URLs where you can start running some of your web pages into these tools just to give you an idea of of how your site is performing. And so the first one is just Google PageSpeed Insights, which is Google's provided tool, and then a third party one here, which is webpagetest webpagetest.org, which is another, again, a third party tool that helps you identify problems that you may have when it comes to the speed of your site or your user experience. And so a couple things of note here. First off oops. I went too far in my presentation here. You want to do a couple things here. You want to actually test a blog post versus a home page. So you might it might not hurt to get your home page or maybe a category page as kind of a baseline or a control for how fast your site is.

Ben Huber [00:23:04]:
But when you're actually testing what a user is going through, it's really important to actually test a post. And so what I've done here is I've actually went through in our dev environment and tested a post to see what the user is actually seeing. And we have done extensive manipulation to our rendering experience to try to speed up just how quickly a user is is seeing our content or this time to interactive, which is the first time that they can actually start interacting with the page. And so we have our scores kind of maxed out. But this is something that, again, if you're a beginner or an intermediate blogger, this is a pretty big investment into your site that you're going to want to make down the road just because these speeds are impacting your bounce rates, your time to interactives, and just how quickly people are, in fact, able to interact with your site. So what I've done is I've put together a list here of things that pretty much any blogger can address to Right to ensure that the average user that comes to your site is going to have a good experience. So I've ranked them from easy to implement to some of the more harder ones to implement. That way, you can use this as a frame of reference or a checklist for addressing speed problems that you may have with your site.

Ben Huber [00:24:21]:
So the first thing and probably the more most common thing I see is just uncompressed images. And so if you've been blogging for a little while, you probably know that you need to use a tool to compress your images so that the file sizes are not exceeding, on average, probably a 100 kilobytes or so. I think that if you properly resize and re compress excuse me. If you resize and upload the correct file extension for for your images. So usually, a JPEG versus a PNG or something like that, you're gonna have betterly betterly better compressed images that that reduce the overall file size and the amount of time it takes for a reader to render them. And then some other things that you can address to speed up your user experience is caching, gzip and Right compression, minification, and CDNs. These are all things that you may have various levels of comfort with. And if you're not uncomfortable if you are comfortable with them, you may want to outsource to a 3rd party.

Ben Huber [00:25:23]:
You can typically find someone that knows what they're doing to kind of address all of these things for about $50 to $200 or so. And I can actually probably put in the show notes a URL or a couple links to people, that I know that provide this service for a reasonable rate. That way, again, if you don't feel comfortable making some of these changes, you can consider making that investment into your blog and and outsourcing it to them. And then for some of you that have been around a while and you've taken care of the top five things there, if you really want to get granular and try to reduce your time to interactives a little bit lower, you can look into better hosting and really addressing some of the granular scripts that are slowing things down so removing render blocking CSS and JavaScript, maybe hosting third party scripts on your own server. That way, you don't have to rely on a third party to render your page. Sometimes if a plug in fails or a script fails, your user may not be able to render your site at all. So that's something that you can look forward to down the road, but if you can basically address anything and everything on this list, you're gonna be well positioned to provide a good user experience. And so the the second trend that we've really noticed in 2019 that I think Google is trying to really hammer home here is your the uniqueness of your site really matters.

Ben Huber [00:26:54]:
So since 2013 and, really, especially in 2015 with Brian Dean kind of coining this whole skyscraper technique thing, it became a way for bloggers to create progressively better content than competitors for a particular query. And so what we began to see in the mid, you know, 20teens here is bloggers creating these mega guides targeting specific keywords in the hopes that Google would recognize that their piece of content was better than what was out there. And that kind of lent itself to having these really, really long blog posts that maybe were a little bit superfluous or fluff in some aspects, and wasn't just necessarily better content for the reader. And what I think you're going to start to see in 2020, especially, is that that is no longer gonna fly. People don't have the attention spans to really stick around for that period of time and before they bounce and get uninterested with your content. And the reason that I included this slide in here is because, specifically, some changes that we saw Google make in 2019 to their QRGs or their Quality Rater Guidelines that where they added a one word term to a section of the QRGs that really kind of caught some people off guard, and that is they really want content to be unique. Not just original, but unique. And the way that we're interpreting that is that it's not enough for your content to necessarily be original.

Ben Huber [00:28:34]:
They want stuff that doesn't appear in 5,000 other places on the web. And so if your entire strategy revolves around targeting specific queries and writing content for it, you're not doing anything that's entirely unique. Your content may be original, and you might have original thought in each particular, post that you write, but there's nothing necessarily unique about what you're doing. And so just be sure that you are not only writing content to satisfy user queries or questions, but you're also producing content that is unique and wholly unique to your brand. And I think I highlight that a little bit here on this next slide, where I talk about the differences of uniqueness. So you've got page level page level differences, which is, again, what I was referring to, in the sense that you might create a better guide than another blogger on how to make spaghetti. But that only kind of pertains to the page level differences between your site. And really, what I think Google is getting at here is that they want to see kind of sitewide differences and internet wide differences between what you're writing and what your competitors are writing.

Ben Huber [00:29:51]:
So just adding value beyond, just what you're writing on a daily basis. I'm gonna take a sip of water here. Excuse me. And so there's a couple ways that you can do that. Obviously, one is to make sure that each article on your own site is unique so you're not copying content from or even paraphrasing content from article to article, especially when you're targeting similar keywords. They want to see that everything that you place on your site is an original piece of content that's unique to you and preferably unique to the Internet. So I think that that's something that you're really gonna start Google start to see Google focus on, almost like they did with Panda when they went after content farms that were just republishing stuff over and over that was pretty thin. I think that you're gonna start to see Google start to suppress sites that don't publish unique content.

Ben Huber [00:30:49]:
So just something to keep in mind if your if your only content marketing strategy is search related. Just make sure that your content is unique enough, that it you're not just offering the same thing that other bloggers are are offering to the world. And one thing that you can do to kind of combat that is to run not only your own content through plagiarism checkers to kind of kind of cross reference your content across your own site, but also these same plagiarism checkers can be used to scan the web and make sure that your content isn't too closely related to another piece of content on the web. And the next trend that I wanted to get into a little bit was specifically branding. I think that we've seen this emergence of of what it means to Google to show brands on SERPs or search engine response pages. And we think that while it's not necessarily, excuse me, a direct ranking factor to be a brand, brands possess a lot of the qualities that Google is looking for when it comes to being a trusted source for content. So Google isn't directly ranking or using their algorithm to isolate and show brands, brands just happen to check off a lot of boxes when it comes to upping the trust factor for their content. And so one of the things I wanted to highlight was just how difficult it is to kind of become a brand.

Ben Huber [00:32:19]:
I think that as a new blogger, you hear about SEO, you hear about how important it is to start building links to your site, And then you begin to realize how long of a journey it is to becoming a brand, so to speak. And so the reason Google really likes to lean heavily on these brands is just the fact that it's hard to fake it. You can fake or build a single link. You can build dozens or even hundreds of links. But it's extremely hard to build a brand that has thousands of linking domains, all of which have, like, positive external context. So if people are complaining about your brand, that might not go in your favor. But if people are constantly praising not only the content that you're publishing, but the user experience that you're providing all the way down to your sales funnel and the customer service that you're providing. If it's all shown in a positive context, Google says, hey, we can really trust the site.

Ben Huber [00:33:16]:
They've been around for a long time. All the external sources that point to them suggest that this particular brand or entity is trustworthy. And, hey, maybe that means something about the content they're writing. Maybe we can place a little more trust in in the content that that these people or this person is publishing. And so your goal as a beginner or even an intermediate blogger is to kind of start trending in this direction. It's not an overnight process. You're not going to become the next Apple overnight. But every day, just thinking about the ways in which you can self brand or self promote yourself and and the implications or the reactions that people are having to it across the web.

Ben Huber [00:33:58]:
And so, specifically, we've seen Google start to make changes to their layout that highlight how much or how important it is to be a brand. And so one of the first things that we've seen on mobile, especially in 2019, and they actually just introduced it in the January core update here in 2020 was the addition of your actual icon or insignia or logo, whatever you want to call it, to their actual SERPs. So they're making it easier for readers to pick out or point to brands or trusted brands. That way, they can immediately go to their content. So DollarSprout, our personal site, happens to be in the in the personal finance sector. And if you've been spent any time in this niche, there are a couple brands that really stick out, and you can kind of know and trust them as reputable sources for information. And so by including their icon in front of their search result, it just makes it a lot easier to to kind of navigate a reader to something that they know is trustworthy. And so and then the other component to this, and this is something that Google talks a little bit about in their QRGs as well, is brands are really important because they stand in front of your content.

Ben Huber [00:35:12]:
So if an author or a publisher of an article is not easily discernible or not even listed, or that particular author may not have a large web presence and they're not necessarily trustworthy, then the brand itself stands in front of the content on that page. So that's just one thing to think about is if you have an author that writes for your blog or you, brand signals tell Google just how trustworthy the content is on this page. So just something to think about as your brand grows is that if you're not sure if an author is trustworthy or you're just not sure first off, that content may or may not you may or may not want to have that on your site. But just know that your brand is how Google is interpreting whether or not they should trust the content on that page. And so just a couple things that you can do here to kind of promote your brand or or signal to Google that your brand is something that's growing and emerging, is, one, you can just query or search for your own brand name, and it'll show you if you're using any sort of, tool, like Keywords Everywhere or something like that. You can actually see how often people are searching for your brand each month. And if you have a few hundred or even a few thousand, searches for your brand each and every month, that's basically signaling to Google that people not only are interested in your content, but they're they're coming back for more for some reason or another. And that's just a powerful signal for them to know that people are truly interested in what you have to say.

Ben Huber [00:37:03]:
And the way that you can kind of increase your branded queries is to get people back on-site or just basically constantly and subtly be in your reader's mind. And so there's a few ways to do that. Email marketing is a great way to get people back on-site, just like paid acquisition, where you're actually going out and you're spending, you know, essentially what amounts to ad revenue excuse me, not ad revenue ad spend on getting readers back on your site. And you can do that through a pixel. There's a ton of good resources on the Internet about how to install a pixel that kind of tracks some of your readers, and and then you can retarget to them or remarket to them on their other platforms. That's a good way to get people back on-site. You can encourage people to bookmark or set their home page to your site. And then there's a litany of other ways that you can kind of think out of the box to get people back on your site.

Ben Huber [00:38:01]:
I know that, again, in our niche of personal finance, one that I've seen recently is is NerdWallet actually started running commercials where they have a jingle that kind of subtly suggests to a listener that they can go to NerdWallet to get all of the answers to their questions so their tagline is actually turn to the nerds, which is I think is a great tagline because it basically implies that each and every time you have a question about personal finance or credit cards or whatever it is that you're interested in, you can turn to the nerds, so to speak, or turn to NerdWallet for that answer. So that's just a marketing tactic that they're using that I think is subtle and may go unnoticed, but it's a good way to increase their branded volume and kinda strengthen their brand. And then, next up, I have you kind of, you know, want to I guess, most simply stop boring your readers, or utilize more multimedia. So Google has signaled that the user experience is enhanced by including certain objects on your page. And, in fact, even in Search Console, you they list certain features as enhancements because Google recognizes that by including them on your page, the user is going to be more interested in what you have to say. And it's another way to kind of differentiate yourself with competitors. And then another pro or a byproduct of using multimedia is that it it it Right engages your readers better, and it's just more enjoyable to read than a massive wall of text. And so by including perhaps a podcast embed or a video embed or an interactive chart or anything other than just text, you enhance the retention rate of what a reader kind of takes away from your page.

Ben Huber [00:39:59]:
So I actually went and found a stat that kinda blew my mind as well, where the Institute of Applied Behavioral Science said that the learning that a reader goes through is a 100% more effective when you include these sorts of multimedia into your pages. So just find ways to get creative about including more things into your site or into your content. And so there is a dual purpose here in including multimedia into your content beyond just making it easier for someone to read or engage with, and that's that Google is actually highlighting these pieces of multimedia in search. So if you have a piece of embedded video, for example, into your content that's not available on Google or excuse me, on YouTube or anywhere else, and you use video object schema to tell Google what your video is about, there is a chance that Google will adopt that schema and show your video on search engine or excuse me, response pages, for a particular query. So if you write a article in this example, how to link build with Google Sheets, and then shoot a video on link building with Google Sheets, there's a chance that not only will your organic results, so your page itself will show up in the search engine response pages but the video will be highlighted in one of these video carousels. And this particular video carousel is at the top of the page on Google. So that's not something that you will see with every query, but there are certain especially how to queries we're starting to see video snippets or video carousels showing up for for these particular, queries. And so again, this particular slide just highlights the importance of video as a function of multimedia and how effective it is at reaching your audience, and just how important video is to Google, just where it is one of the largest platforms for content consumption.

Ben Huber [00:42:01]:
So they are very much highlighting video in their search engine response pages, and it will do you well to include some of them, embedded in your post. And then sorry. My sound went out there for a second. But another thing I was gonna mention is that leveraging med excuse me, multimedia has become easier than ever just with the adoption of or improvement of some of the content management systems that we're using. So WordPress actually announced that they're gonna make lazy loading a default feature in WordPress here coming up shortly, which is great because now you can include 10 or 20 or even 30 images into a single post without it taking forever to load. So you'll still wanna you'll still wanna make sure that your your images are compressed and that they're small enough that a person on a mobile device can quickly render the page. But it is reassuring to know that they are making the tech side of things even more friendly for the lay user. So basically, you can incorporate a lot of multimedia into your posts without fear of the mobile user being impacted by rendering a ton of images.

Ben Huber [00:43:22]:
And then last but not least, one of the bigger changes that we have seen, especially towards the tail end of 2019 here, I think in November, Google has re established the importance of a good user experience or encouraging good behavior. So the analogy or the reference that I chose here was nothing kills a party faster than when people leave early. So if you've ever been at a party and people start leaving, that is pretty much the end of that particular party. And then the same kind of goes for your website. You know, nothing torches your rankings faster than when people leave your site earlier. So kind of getting back to that speed component of it, that's one way to make sure that people don't leave. The other way to make sure that people don't leave is to ensure that the promise that you're delivering in the search engines, so that your title and your meta description, actually deliver on what a user is going to see when they land on your website. And if you deliver on that promise, you're going to start to see lower bounce rates and longer dwell times, so the longer session durations, because people are actually getting what they want when they come to your site.

Ben Huber [00:44:31]:
And so one of the biggest changes that we saw in November of 2019 was Google introduced their new machine learning component to their algorithm, which is known as BERT. And BERT is actually being used in tandem with another algorithm they released in the 20 teens named RankBrain. And those 2 kind of machine learning capabilities are used to determine whether or not the piece of content that you're providing matches what a user is actually searching for. So they're matching user intent to text on a page. And what this is doing is it basically ensures that when a reader or a user types something into Google, they're getting something that's actually relevant to them and not just a page that is stuffed with keywords that was meant to kind of gain the system so that readers would come and land there. And what that ends up doing is it ends up providing a better user experience because they're better matching content that people are actually reading and they're sticking around for. And it just overall is a good synergy between piece of content and reader experience. So unless you're a data science, you don't really truly data scientist, you don't truly need to understand the nuances of BERT.

Ben Huber [00:45:54]:
You just need to know that Google is getting better at understanding and processing text and natural language versus relying on keyword matching. And the best news that you hear all day in terms of SEO is that you don't actually need to optimize for BERT in any way. You just kind of go about incorporating more natural conversational copywriting into your content, and you don't necessarily have to worry so much about matching content to keywords in that undesirable situation of where where you have a sentence that just doesn't read the way you want it to because you're trying to smash a keyword in there. That is something that is becoming less and less important as Google gets better at interpreting what a page is about or what the text on a page is about. And one way that you can get really granular and improve your content so that people are sticking around longer is to maybe consider something like Google Tag Manager. And using Google Tag Manager to specifically track, when people are dropping off a page. So scroll depth tracking. So this is something that maybe some of the beginner bloggers may find confusing, and you may want to reserve this for when you're a little bit further into your blogging journey.

Ben Huber [00:47:13]:
But if you have a page that's ranking well and you wanna make credible improvements to it and you understand kind of the logistics behind how Google Tag Manager works, you can have it to where it fires an event when they reach a certain percentage of depth on the page, and you can kind of critically think to yourself, why is it that a reader is dropping off here, and what is it that I can do to kind of keep them around? And so one way to keep that reader on that piece of content longer would maybe to be embed some sort of widget or some sort of custom graphic or some sort of entertaining fact or something, or maybe even something as simple as just swishing paragraphs around so that readers are sticking around for your entire piece of content. And that way, they're not dropping off early. And I think that those sort of user behavior signals will tell Google, hey, this this reader, not only did this piece of content match intent well, but they scrolled all the way down to the bottom. They spent a lot of time on this page, and they clearly got the answers they were looking for because they didn't just click back to the search results and then go read another article. They either continued on somewhere else in their journey or they stopped searching altogether, which again, these are just basically signals telling Google that they got the information that they needed. And then one other thing that you can do that a lot of other bloggers, especially myself included, get kind of lazy about is each and every time, excuse me, you publish a new piece of content, take the time to actually go back and interlink from that piece to older articles, and then go into older articles that are relevant and interlink to that new piece of content. By linking to your new content, not only do you give them a little bit of an SEO boost, but you provide a better user experience in those old articles because you're providing additional context in the form of interlinking to a topically related piece of content. So definitely take the time to go back and to go into your articles and interlink to the content that you're publishing.

Ben Huber [00:49:18]:
And then my last thing I have for you guys, is just, again, to think critically about the user experience in in 2020, especially on the mobile side of things. Where Google switched to mobile first indexing in 2019, it shows how serious they are about providing a good user experience to mobile users. And that is highlighted none better than by just how many people are using their mobile devices in 2020. So as you can see, even 10 years ago, just when smartphones were released, almost none of the web traffic in the world was mobile. And by 2018, over 52% of it was. So people are spending over 3 hours a day on their phone. And if your site is not mobile friendly or mobile responsive or doesn't even look good on mobile, you're basically signaling to Google that you don't care about the majority of people on the internet. So again, my challenge for everyone here is just audit all of your new or cornerstone content from a mobile perspective for the next 30 days.

Ben Huber [00:50:21]:
So when you hit Publish on a piece of content or on a post and you think it looks great and then you switch over to mobile on your phone and you see that it looks terrible, you at least have enlightened yourself to what you're putting your readers or the majority of your readers through. And you need to take the time to go back and address why formatting or a picture or an image is blurry on mobile but it wasn't on desktop. I think that you will start to see that your session durations, your dwell times, your balance rates, all of that stuff will start to improve if you start thinking critically about how to provide a better mobile perspective. And once all of those user behavior signals get sent back to Google, I think that you're going to start to see better positions on for some of your more important queries. But anyways, that is all I got for you guys for this particular presentation. I hope you got something out of it. If you aren't sure about something or wanna follow-up or or just have a ton of questions because I basically threw a ton at you guys and you don't know how to quite implement it all, feel free to ask me or tag me a question in our blogging group. We have a blogging group on Facebook that addresses all of this stuff.

Ben Huber [00:51:32]:
It's called Breaking the 1 Percent Ultimate Blogging Group or BTP Ultimate Blogging Group. You can find me there. If you have any questions, just tag me. I'm happy to answer them. But anyways, you guys have a good one.

Liz Stapleton [00:51:42]:
Right. Then thank you so much for all that information. It's definitely giving me a lot to think about in terms of crafting my editorial calendar and going back and fixing some of my older content. So thank you. Any final words? I know we're gonna talk about your Facebook group too, but but any last words you wanna add.

Ben Huber [00:51:57]:
Sure. Yeah.

Ben Huber [00:51:58]:
I think it's I think it's one of those things where, you know, obviously, you can get overwhelmed with the number of changes that you just want to immediately go back and make to your website. And I think that, you know, if you learned anything today, I think just pick pick one of the topics and kind of tackle that first. I mean, a lot of times with SEO, there's site wide changes to make and that can feel super overwhelming. So just, you know, just tackle the site speed or just tackle the technical side of SEO. Get that knocked out and then move on to other things. If you're trying to revise a 100 or even 300 blog posts all at once for SEO, you're just gonna weigh yourself in. So focus on one thing and then kind of knock those out until you've kind of holistically addressed, you know, the search perspective of of bringing people to the system.

Ben Huber [00:52:40]:
Systematic approach

Liz Stapleton [00:52:40]:
to it, and don't try Right do everything all at once.

Ben Huber [00:52:42]:
Sure.

Liz Stapleton [00:52:43]:
Sure. Make sure you watch the system sessions of this as well.

Ben Huber [00:52:47]:
Yes. Absolutely.

Ben Huber [00:52:49]:
But I

Liz Stapleton [00:52:49]:
know so I know you have a Facebook group. You wanna tell us about that so that they can go go join it and whatnot?

Ben Huber [00:52:55]:
Yeah. Absolutely. So our Facebook group is the BTOP, Ultimate Blogging Group. You can just search for us on Facebook and it should pop up right away. I think the primary benefit there is that, you know, SEO is such a large journey. It's an ongoing journey, so you're probably gonna have questions all the time. We're we're always happy to answer them. So if there's something that I didn't talk about or there's something you wanna follow-up on or, like I said, there's, like, a technical component that you just can't wrap your head around, I'll be happy to answer it.

Ben Huber [00:53:20]:
Just all I have to do is create a thread, and we'll see if we we can knock it out for you.

Liz Stapleton [00:53:24]:
And as I'm looking to valuable resources, the link is below. They should definitely go check it out. I'm gonna go join. I don't think I'm in it right now, and I gotta fix that.

Ben Huber [00:53:31]:
So Yes. Absolutely.

Liz Stapleton [00:53:33]:
So thank you so much. And, everyone, you know, check out check out the Facebook group and and say hi to Ben and say thank you.

Ben Huber [00:53:39]:
Yes. Thank you. Thank you. Appreciate you having me on.
