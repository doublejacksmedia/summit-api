[00:00:10.580] - Doreen Vanderhart, knapcreative.ca
I am so glad that you're here. I'm very, very excited to sit down with you and talk to you about how to uncomplicate your marketing, but those of you that haven't met me yet my name is Doreen.

[00:00:20.000] - Doreen
I am the heart and soul behind Knap Creative and that's what we're here for. We uncomplicate your marketing so that you can get seen, get heard and get results. So that's really what we're all about. I super appreciate your time, so I'm not going to waste any of it. We're going to dive right in. This is going to be action packed, value packed. I hope that you have your notebook because you're going to want to take notes.

[00:00:40.430] - Doreen
And of course, you can always catch the replay again later. Uncomplicating your marketing. When you sit down and think about your marketing plan, what does that look like? So I'm guessing the first few things that popped into your head are kind of presented as a list where it's like email marketing, maybe Facebook, Instagram, you name it, a social media platform. You know, chances are if that's the case, you feel like you're constantly hustling and doing all the things to get the word out about your business, but you're not necessarily seeing the traction that you want to see.

[00:01:11.330] - Doreen
You're not seeing a steady flow of new clients. Maybe you're in a bit of a feast or famine cycle. You know, you're showing up on Instagram consistently. Check it off the list. You've got a weekly blog or a podcast or a news... You know, you name it, check it off the list or maybe none of the above. And you're feeling super guilty about it. Totally been there. Zero judgment, super common. You're absolutely not alone.

[00:01:33.500] - Doreen
So if despite doing all of the marketing things or trying to do all the marketing things that you feel like you should be doing, the results aren't showing up. Maybe I know it's very easy to get in a weird headspace, like maybe it's because you're not doing reels yet, or maybe you're hashtags are super sucky or, you know, maybe you straight up don't have what people are looking for. So it can be very easy to get into kind of a spin about that.

[00:01:57.830] - Doreen
So first thing right out the gate, I'm going to say, nope, none of that is the problem. We're going to dig into that and get down to the very, very nitty gritty of it. So first thing I will say is that strategy and tactics are usually implemented backwards. So if your social media are your marketing plan feels like like a lot of like, oh, look at this new feature or check your engagement or how many followers do you have now, that kind of stuff.

[00:02:24.050] - Doreen
Stop it. That's not going to get you anywhere. So a marketing to do list is not a strategy unless it all works together to turn your community into paying clients. So tactics are kind of that's like like I said, it's like your engagement. How many followers, the new features, all the things that are constantly rolling out can be extremely overwhelming and it can be very hard to keep up. Those are tactics. So the strategy is kind of the foundation underneath it.

[00:02:51.410] - Doreen
So I always look at this kind of like an ice cream cone where the tactics are the sprinkles, like they're great to have. They're delicious, they're lovely, but they're not the most important thing. So you want to get the ice cream in the cone first, and that's what we're going to talk about today. So we're not going to get into the specifics on a lot of tactics because those change every frickin second. So so we're not going to get into that.

[00:03:13.340] - Doreen
We're going to get into the foundation. That's the most important part. Once you have a handle on that, the tactics are like the sprinkles and you can just kind of do what works for you and what feels for you. Good for you. And I promise it will work.

[00:03:24.290] - Doreen
So first thing, we're going to step it way back to the very, very almost before the beginning. But this is something that probably doesn't pop into your head when you think about your marketing plan. But it's the most important part, that is your client experience. So at the end of the day, this is what really matters. Like you can spend so many hours and so many dollars on marketing or on your social media, but if your client experience sucks, you're honestly you're not going to get anywhere.

[00:03:52.970] - Doreen
Whereas on the other side of the coin, like if you have a really impeccable client experience, people are going to be shouting your name from the rooftops. You're going to get referrals, you're going to get that word of mouth. You haven't even opened a social media app. You have not to stress about it for a second. And you already have a marketing strategy in place. So the best marketing strategy ever is to truly from the heart. I know it sounds corny.

[00:04:14.510] - Doreen
It totally is. I'm all about that, is to care about your client and the people that you work with. So and I should even, not even your client. But if you're if you're on social media or anything like that about your, your readers, like whether they're going to buy from you or not, you have your perfect fit person, really just put yourself in their shoes and do whatever you can to be helpful.

[00:04:37.040] - Doreen
We'll get into that stuff later. But really, it comes down to caring about your person.

[00:04:41.870] - Doreen
So once you've done that, once you do know that you have a really good client experience and I know that nothing is ever perfect but, you know, knock their socks off as much as you can, then you want to do the stuff that you do, you think of when you think of marketing.

[00:04:55.340] - Doreen
So let's jump into that. The first thing that we always, always, always start with is goals.

[00:05:02.630] - Doreen
So we do have on our website knapcreative.ca/resources has a free workbook for this part, so I hope you brought your notebook, you can definitely jot down some notes as we're doing this, but if you I'm a sucker for a good workbook. So if you are like me and you want to have a beautiful plan that's properly formatted, definitely go check that out. It's totally free so you can just download it. Knapcreative.ca/resources.

[00:05:31.660] - Doreen
So the first thing that we're going to do with our goals is kind of, I guess, a gut check. So what you want to do is you want to jot down what you'd like to see more of and less of in your life. So legit just two columns like more and less. Some things that are overwhelming you or things that you would like to opt out of, go into last column, obviously, and then things that you want to lean in to go in the more columns.

[00:05:51.380] - Doreen
So what do you want your life to look like? Because if you're not thinking about that when you're creating your goals...

[00:05:58.530] - Doreen
We need to that's the most important part. So make sure that you are really looking at what you want your actual life to look like and not just at your financial business goals or the impact that you want to make, things like that. But just like the day to day little minutia that you want your life to look like, we need to make sure that we're checking in with ourselves on that stuff.

[00:06:21.570] - Doreen
The next thing, we're going to get a little bit more technical and a little bit more business. We want to look at the last 12 months. So the first thing that you need to check is what drove the most revenue. So, yeah, what was what was the what was the biggest income driver in your business? And then the second thing like revenue and profits can be two very different things. So make sure that whatever is driving revenue is actually profitable as well, because, yeah, we just need to make sure that we're aligned on those two things.

[00:06:47.580] - Doreen
And then you want to look at the other side of the coin, too, like, what about the least revenue? So I know as entrepreneurs you can have a lot of ideas and some of them are awesome and some of them think like they feel awesome at first, but then they don't really land the way that we want them to land. But it can be very easy to get attached to those goals. And I'm speaking from personal experience here.

[00:07:08.100] - Doreen
So look at those things like what is not driving revenue in your business? How much effort does it require? Like if it's costing you a lot of your bandwidth and it's not really driving revenue? Maybe it's time to let it go.

[00:07:20.340] - Doreen
Yeah, I know it can be really emotionally attached to these ideas, but maybe you can let it go for now and revisit it in three months or six months or a year. But maybe now it's just not the time for that particular offer. So then once you have that information and of course there's going to be stuff in between, but just kind of evaluate what's working and what's not working, then you want to use that information to break down your offerings for the next a little bit.

[00:07:44.880] - Doreen
So some people are really good at setting five year goals or one year goals or like doing the big picture stuff. And some people that's a lot to bite off. So I say look at at least the next three months and then kind of have a general idea of the next year ish, if you can. But do what works for you, obviously. So you want to break out the next 3 to 12 months and here's what you want to look at.

[00:08:09.640] - Doreen
So you want to first look at, you actually want to first look at what your sales goal is. So how much money do you need to or want to make in the next 3 to 12 months? Then you want to look at your offer and the price of that offer. And then you'll know once you have those three things, you're going to know exactly how many of your offer you're going to need to sell in order to make the revenue that you want to make.

[00:08:30.870] - Doreen
And then again, on number four and five revenue, you need to look at that, obviously, but also make sure that you're not forgetting about your take home pay because you need to make sure that you are being compensated for all of your hard work. Absolutely. So very important. So then this is going to give you a really good idea of what your goals actually are. That's a really good place to start. So once you have that, then we are going to look at the seasonal shifts in your business.

[00:08:54.930] - Doreen
So you want to take note of any important dates. And this is also applies to your life, right? So if you want to take a vacation on a certain day, like make sure that you're making note of that when you're creating your marketing plan, you want to look at national holidays, launches, promotions, like if you have any seasons that are particular busy for selling, you know, maybe you're super busy in the summer and it dies off in the winter or the other way around.

[00:09:17.610] - Doreen
Maybe Christmas is really busy or fall if you're a photographer, if fall is really, really busy. So just depending on your industry and what you do, you're going to have seasons that are, that are, you know, a little more packed than other ones. So one thing, for the year in advance is that I do is that I actually have it jotted down. You can see it's a total disaster, but I write down the kind of vibe that's happening for my perfect customer at any point in time.

[00:09:45.690] - Doreen
So I know that, you know, on the third week of June, the moms are ready to throw dog treats in their kids' lunches because they're so ready to just be done with all of it. You know, September is like a mini new year. It's really a fresh start. It's kind of yeah, it's it's really like a mini new year for for a lot of people that are in business.

[00:10:04.230] - Doreen
You know, on September 27, the leaves are perfect in southern Alberta where I live, you know, just like making note of all the things that are happening, this is going to be hard to do right out the gate, like you're going to have a general idea. But make sure you keep track of this throughout the year and you are going to have this is marketing gold for you. Like, the longer you do this, the better it is.

[00:10:25.650] - Doreen
So I definitely recommend just printing off a piece of paper and keeping this handy.

[00:10:30.240] - Doreen
I always have this sitting on my desk like for years, and it's been really good because I can be very proactive about what's happening in my client's life. And instead of, like waiting for the for the feeling to come and then addressing it then or even missing it altogether.

[00:10:45.360] - Doreen
So super handy to have. OK, so then once you've got that, then we can sit down and actually create a marketing plan.

[00:10:54.960] - Doreen
So first I'm geek out with you guys a little bit about the customer journey, so the customer journey, I know that sounds technical and jargony, but trust me, it's not that complicated. It always proceeds in the same order. So this is like any relationship in any person's life. It always starts with curiosity. You meet someone, you run across somebody, you're curious about them, and then you get to chatting. You have conversations with this person.

[00:11:24.150] - Doreen
And then eventually, eventually you're going to be friends, you're going to get married like, you know, you're going to do whatever the next step. Right. So same thing goes for your your brand and your business relationship.

[00:11:35.220] - Doreen
So it's kind of like it's kind of like a game of supermario where you enter the little world and you have to go through all the hoops to get to the end. Same goes for your business. You can't sell unless you've gone through all the hoops. Right. Like you can't invite them into working with you until you've nurture that relationship and all the other stuff. So these are the phases of the customer journey. First, you're going to attract someone to your brand, then you're going to nurture that relationship with all of your excellent content that we're going to get to.

[00:12:01.770] - Doreen
Then you're going to invite them into working with you and then you're going to delight them. You're going to knock your socks off with a really impeccable client experience. So that's the customer journey. We're going to take off each of these sections and we're going to dive into each one. So we're going to talk a little bit of attract, nurture, invite, delight and come up with a strategy so that you have a really well-rounded marketing plan and nobody's falling through the cracks and getting forgotten because, yeah, you're going to have a leak.

[00:12:24.990] - Doreen
If you've got one of these that isn't working, you've got a leak in your marketing plan and you're not going to be getting the traction that you want to see. So let's start with attract.

[00:12:33.390] - Doreen
The number of platforms that we have access to is honestly ridiculous. It's ridiculous.

[00:12:40.650] - Doreen
And I totally get that not showing up on all of the platforms can really feel like leaving money on the table. Like it's, it's just there's so many opportunities. Why would you not take them? All right. So, but I will say, knowing what's even a bigger bummer is diffusing your efforts over the whole Internet and not getting any traction whatsoever. You know, it's just it's incredibly time consuming. It takes a ton of energy. And honestly, most of us don't have the bandwidth to show up well on more than one or two platforms at most.

[00:13:10.740] - Doreen
So for this part, I would say one strategy or platform for this part is great. And a really good place to start is to look at the past year or two, depending on how long that you've been in business, and see where all of your favorite clients are finding you. So the people that you really love to work with, the people that you really connect with, where are they finding you and how can you lean into that a little bit more?

[00:13:33.450] - Doreen
Because if you've got, if you've got a faucet that's already flowing, you want to crank that up. So if one of these is already working for you, crank it up like there's no need to reinvent the wheel.

[00:13:43.470] - Doreen
Networking and relationship building should always be at the heart of your marketing strategy. So this is where a lot of that comes in. Then you also want to look at what you're good at. So whether it's writing, whether it's video, voice, Podcast, things like that, you need to lean into your personal strengths to attract people to your brand. It's much more sustainable if you just lean into what you're good at. So what of these are you good at?

[00:14:08.010] - Doreen
What's something that you can see yourself doing sustainably over the long term? Just, you know, put a little check or jot down something that might work for you, for your strategy, and we'll pull all the pieces together later.

[00:14:19.560] - Doreen
So that's it for the attract one. And also, this isn't like a complete list. There's a million things that you can do to attract people to your brand that aren't listed here. This is just some of the really common ones. Yeah. So if there's something else where people are, where are people discovering you? That's what we're looking at here. Then once they've discovered you, obviously we have to go through to the next hoop, which is nurture.

[00:14:42.460] - Doreen
So this is what a lot of us think of when we think about marketing. So this is social media, email marketing, all that kind of stuff. Again, don't feel like you have to show up on every single platform, because that's going to that's going to diffuse your efforts too much. And you're not going to be effective on the platforms that you do want to show up on. Another quick note on this is to not just show up when you need work.

[00:15:03.290] - Doreen
So consistency is what's going to get you out of the feast or famine cycle. I'm sure you've heard this before. This is not news. I'm not going to dwell on it. But I will say consistency is what equals trust, but also know that consistent and constant are not the same word. Right. So consistently doesn't mean constantly. So you want to create a schedule that's sustainable for you. So, you know, if that looks like showing up two or three times a week, show up two or three times a week. If that looks like showing up five to seven times a week, do that like do what works for you over the long term.

[00:15:37.810] - Doreen
Because what we want to get away from is showing up, you know, seven times for two weeks and then dropping off the face of the planet to recover for a month and then doing the whole thing again. We want to get away from that. So look at what's consistent and what's sustainable, not what's constant. I am going to share some content ideas with you coming up. But I just if you're struggling with being consistent, I wish I had a magic pill because I would be a billionaire.

[00:16:05.110] - Doreen
There is no magic pill. You need to just schedule it and commit. If you're serious about your business, you will be serious about your marketing. Sales are the lifeblood of your business. And if you're not prioritizing your marketing, you're not going to be getting a steady flow of leads and that's just not going to end well. So you're a business owner. You're in this for real. Make sure that it's a priority because that's that's what your business is.

[00:16:26.100] - Doreen
So it either is going to take from you time, or it's going to cost you money, like just a little bit of tough love. Like, that's just that's how it works. But this is also what keeps your business going. So I can't emphasize enough how important it is.

[00:16:40.000] - Doreen
OK, so let's talk about what you can talk about. This might make things a little bit easier and get the juices flowing.

[00:16:46.900] - Doreen
So first thing, so then let's say you chosen your social media platform or platforms that you're going to show up on, but you're like, I don't know what to write. I don't know what to say, you know, all that kind of stuff. So let's jump into that. So the first question that you want to answer is, what do you have to offer? So go back to your goals that we did at the very beginning.

[00:17:05.980] - Doreen
What you want to do is you want to observe and serve your perfect fit person. So, you know, just all you want to do is serve the difference between showing up just to show up and showing up to serve is night and day like you're going to feel this instantly. So really just. What does their day look like? How can you help them out? How can you give them a quick win? How can you be in their life?

[00:17:31.980] - Doreen
How can you apply what's happening in your life to their life? Like, what do you, what do you have to offer? How can you help that person? So a couple of things about that. Your content does have to be connected to your offer if you want to make any sale. So you don't want to just be helping them with all the random things in their life, like somehow connect it back to your offer if and when you can. And the other thing is we also need to know how to hire you, like it needs to be crystal clear on your social media profiles, like how how does it work to work with you?

[00:18:02.380] - Doreen
What can we, what can we do with you? How can we collaborate with you? How can we purchase from you? Whatever that is? We need to know what that is. And you need to be very enthusiastic about it, because if you're not enthusiastic about it, nobody else is going to be enthusiastic about it either. So don't be shy. You're here to serve, like, whether that's a pay product or something that you're offering for free as far as, like, information or value.

[00:18:23.410] - Doreen
Either way, you're serving your client. So, yeah, it's really not that big of a deal to sell something because it's in place of service. Right. Second thing, be helpful without expecting anything in return. So, again, just kind of reiterating think about who you want to work with and answer the questions that they might have around the topics that your offer serves or solves. Really just to be helpful, it doesn't have to be more complicated than that.

[00:18:52.990] - Doreen
So you want to make sure that your audience has their ears perk for your content. And the way to do that is to be a valuable resource. So what frustrations are they experiencing on a daily basis? Like what does their day look like? How can you make their day with a quick win? Another thing that you can address here is what do they feel guilty about? This is a really big one. What are they kind of feeling gross about?

[00:19:16.150] - Doreen
How can you encourage them in that, you know empathize with them? You don't have to be patronizing, but let them know like you have been there or you know, I know that, how this feels, like, how what ,what do you do about it? Turn it around. I read somewhere quite a while ago and it really always stuck with you. And that's that people will do anything for those that encourage their dreams, justify their failures and allay their fears. And I think that's very true. So make sure that you're weaving that into your content as well.

[00:19:43.000] - Doreen
And then the third thing that you want to do is what is the aspirational lifestyle of your perfect client? So if this person purchased from you, what could their life look like, like cast a vision for their future? How much easier how much are you going to save them? Time or money or frustration? What's that going to look like? So basically, all of this in a nutshell, what you're talking about is really the problem that you're solving, the solution.

[00:20:07.870] - Doreen
You're presenting yourself as the solution and then the result of working with you. So you want to position your client as the hero, not yourself. I know this can be really tricky to do, but you are the guide.

[00:20:18.610] - Doreen
So so if you want to dig into this a little bit more, Donald Miller of building a story brand does this so well. His content is gold, but basically this is what it is. So a character has a problem. So the character, the main character, it's not you, it's your perfect fit client. So a character is a problem. But then he meets a guy that is you who gives them a plan, which is your offer calls them to action, which helps them avoid failure and ends in success.

[00:20:45.970] - Doreen
So these are the elements that you want in the content that you're creating. And it's going to work really easily when you answer the questions that we've just talked about. So quick review. You've got a strategy to attract people to your brand and now you're nurturing those relationships with all of this stuff that we just talked about. So nurture equals trust and trust equals dollars in your jeans. So that's what we want to do. So you have some really good stuff, like you could take this stuff that we've already covered and you'd be like, you have a lot to work with and you could be very effective, but let's kick it up a notch.

[00:21:20.980] - Doreen
This is 2020, 2021. There's a million people out there doing the same thing as you like, we know we're all working in a very saturated market. You know, they can rip off your color palette, they can copy your style. They can cut and paste your offer into their own. It's not ideal, but this is just reality. The one thing that they can't do is be you. So you need to use that.

[00:21:44.890] - Doreen
I have to sneeze. So who.... I think it's OK anyways.

[00:21:52.540] - Doreen
Your personality is your competitive advantage. So you want to use that. This is where the magic happens. So when it comes to posting personal content, I know that this can be tricky. Everybody has a different threshold for what they're comfortable with. You know, I'm personally quite a private person. I don't want to share a lot about my life, but I know how important it is that my personality is reflected in my brand. So for me, it comes down to sharing a lot about just a little bit of stuff.

[00:22:19.780] - Doreen
So I'm fueled by compliments. I'm a goal and productivity nerd. I love books. I have eight siblings. You know, there's just like a handful of things that I touch on frequently. And it's top of mind when people do think of productivity or goals or books or any of those things, or big fam... you know, then I'm I'm what pops into their head. So that's kind of what we do. It's only a few things. Obviously, there's a lot more to me, but those are just a few things that I'll share frequently.

[00:22:46.510] - Doreen
So that that's kind of makes it a little bit more sticky. Also, I will say, do not second guess this stuff like you can be very hard to be like these are the five things or whatever. A lot of it can come down to just showing your personality. And like, "I just have to sneeze." I could have rerecorded this entire video for it, but it's honestly not that big of a deal. I've also been on Instagram stories and laughed hysterically at my own dumb joke, which probably wasn't even that funny.

[00:23:15.220] - Doreen
That's the stuff that gets the most, like that, so.... It just, it just really lets your personality shine and it's important to just be your quirky little self. So you're going to, when you, when you do that and you hit publish anyways on that stuff. And I know like, it's easy to second guess it, but just hit publish on it anyways and you will see way better engagement. You'll see that attracting more people that are really similar to you, you know, that appreciate the same dad jokes as you tell or whatever that might be.

[00:23:43.690] - Doreen
So it's actually really good for your brand to just let that stuff fly. I don't know. Sounds bad, but you're not as unique as you think. Like we all, all of that stuff that you feel insecured about, can't even talk, all the dumb stuff that you feel insecure about. We probably do, too. So it's good to just let that out a little bit. You don't have to leave it all on the table. But definitely, you know, if there's the odd moment or whatever, whatever you're comfortable with, definitely not even whatever you're comfortable with, whatever you're a little bit uncomfortable with, let it fly.

[00:24:14.050] - Doreen
It's OK. It's really good to let that stuff be in there.

[00:24:17.710] - Doreen
So once you've done that, then you want to invite...

[00:24:22.770] - Doreen
Invite your audience into the sale, right? So you've you've attracted them to your brand, you've nurtured that relationship, it's very easy to just kind of get stuck there like it's very comfortable asking for sale can be difficult. I know that there can be a lot of head trash around that, too. But if you get stuck in the nurture phase, that's a recipe for social media burnout because you're not going to be getting the results that you want to see.

[00:24:44.880] - Doreen
So first of all, you need to make it abundantly clear what you do and for whom. Like, what's your elevator pitch like? For us, it's uncomplicate your marketing so you can get seen, get heard and get results. So, you know, if we're here, if you're on account, that's what we're here for. So everything that we offer, that's what it's for. And then this changes throughout, like our Instagram bio doesn't say that, but that's that's the underlying thing, the mission that's underneath everything.

[00:25:12.630] - Doreen
And then how we do that, that's really let me just see her. So right now, our Instagram bio, this is our offer. So our offer is the social media toolbox and it's here. Never worry about what to post on social media again, juicy story ideas, caption templates and simple strategies right here. And that's what it is. Like, that's how you can work with us right now. The only way to work with us right now, it's super clear.

[00:25:36.630] - Doreen
We're super excited about it. We're asking people to take the next step in working with us and they don't have to guess like it is not your readers job to figure that out. They're going to burn calories. They're just going to leave. So make sure that it's really, really clear. And then the second part of that is making sure that the process of purchasing is as easy and seamless as possible. So don't make your checkout process really hard.

[00:25:57.720] - Doreen
This is, you know, the twenty first century.

[00:26:01.140] - Doreen
You don't want to you know, the Internet's been around for a while. Make your check out online and digital, especially after 2020. Everything has moved online and it's not going anywhere. So make sure that it's really easy and seamless. And then also, like, you know, at the end of your post or anything like that, you don't have to call your audience to purchase from you on every post, but definitely make sure that it's really clear that you do want them to work with you.

[00:26:25.200] - Doreen
Because like I said earlier, if you want to talk about it, they sure as heck aren't going to be either. So that's what we want to do. Then the last part of the thing is going to be to the last part of the thing I found so legit and professional. The last part of your marketing plan is to delight. So we talked about this at the very beginning. The best marketing strategy that you can ever have is to care.

[00:26:47.130] - Doreen
Referrals are the holy grail of marketing and the absolute best way to grow your business. So when you surprise and delight your customers on the other side of a purchase, they will be shouting your name for the, from the rooftops. And this is going to get you further than one hundred social media posts, no matter how well crafted they are. So if you think about all of the stuff that we covered, like we've talked about attact, nurture, invite and delight, the order of priority as you're building your marketing plan is actually the reverse of the order that the customer journey actually proceedes.

[00:27:16.350] - Doreen
And so not to make this very confusing, you do want to hit every step. But if you're like, well, this is a lot. I know it's a lot to chew off and we don't expect you to have everything. One hundred percent like this is always going to be evolving. This is like a living, breathing plan that's going to change as your business changes. But you're going to notice like maybe a leak in your attract strategy. Like you're you're not growing your audience as quickly as you would like to for your goals or something like that.

[00:27:47.250] - Doreen
Or maybe you've noticed, like you're growing your audience, but you're not really converting them into a sale. So maybe your invite strategy, maybe your nurture strategy, like look at the portions that need a little bit of work. But if you're just looking at straight up priority, you want to work backwards. So first delight, like we talked about your customer experience is the most important thing. That's the first priority. Then once you know that you have a handle on that, then you could talk about nurture and invite.

[00:28:14.490] - Doreen
Right. So those kind of go hand in hand.

[00:28:16.140] - Doreen
They go together. But we're not going to worry about attracting new people to your brand until you know how to work with the people that are already there.

[00:28:25.290] - Doreen
So don't worry about building your audience. If you've got one hundred people in your audience and you really know how to nurture and invite those hundred people, you're going to get a lot more traction. We've seen it firsthand. Accounts that have ten thousand followers are not doing as well as the teeny tiny accounts. So you don't need a big audience to be successful. Definitely look at delight and then look at nurture and invite and really get a handle on that.

[00:28:46.560] - Doreen
Once you have that, then you can work on attracting new people into your brand. So that's really what's going to amplify your effort at the end of the day, right? Don't lean a lot of energy into attract until you've got a good handle on the other stuff. So don't start with one hundred things. Start with one thing. I know this can be very hard. I remind myself all the time, like it doesn't all have to happen today, one thing at a time, you know, it's just going to make you that much more effective when you really focus on one thing versus a million.

[00:29:18.210] - Doreen
So really delight first, then nurture and invite and then attract new people to your brand. It's going to amplify so, so good.
