I'm really excited for this next session because it's dealing with copywriting, which is something that I always strive to be better at because I swear it's the hardest thing. And this speaker is the brains, and that is behind Damn Copy, which I love the name where she writes conversion copy for biz owners and self templates, so you can get great conversion copy without the custom price tag. She also teaches service providers how to be more profitable and sell what they sell without stress. A big, warm welcome to Sandra Van Der Lee. Sandra, thank you so much for agreeing to be part of this.

[00:00:42.910] - Sandra
Honestly, thank you so much for having me. I love doing interviews. It's one of my favorite things.

[00:00:48.990] - Liz
Yes, I love like getting to meet the speakers this way. It's fun. Okay, so today we're going to be talking about copywriting, but more specifically in regards to funnels. So, I wonder if you could quickly provide your definition of conversion copywriting and what a funnel is.

[00:01:07.750] - Sandra
Conversion copywriting is just a really fancy way of saying copy to make sales, right. To me, a conversion doesn't just happen on a sales page, right, it's in everything, it's how you email, it's how you show up, you know, this is not copywriting. But even this is about conversion in some way, right? Everything we do is sales. So, I use the term conversion copywriting because people generally understand that if they want me to write an about page, I am probably not the person to come and ask. Right. I can do those things, but it's not where I specialize. Honestly, to me, it's writing language that helps a person make a decision about your product or your offer. That's conversion copywriting to me. There's probably sleazy people out there who think it's about getting the sale. That's not really how it works, right?

[00:01:59.720] - Liz
Okay. And then what do you consider to be a funnel? Because funnel can be a very interpreted word ,online business.

[00:02:13.290] - Sandra
Well, my company name is Damn Copy.

[00:02:14.900] - Sandra
I'm going to be contrarian in this and be like, you know, I don't have a funnel in place for anything officially, in the sense that my VA is working on some of them. And I have the classic one where it's like, you opt into a thing. We give you a discount on the self-study course, but only in the next five days with deadline funnel, right?

[00:02:32.370] - Liz
Yeah.

[00:02:32.670] - Sandra
Which is kind of the classic minimum viable funnel version, is like, hey, here's a reason to buy this thing. Now we're going to give you something free, we're going to tell you about the offer, and then you choose whether you want it or not, right. That's the most basic version. Then you have super complicated ones where you add on webinars, and now it's like application only, and there's private training, and we'll send you like, a personalized DM funnel in your Instagram, right, all that stuff. You can get real fancy. To me, a funnel is more around. Like, it's about a relationship. Right. It's the process someone goes through to sort of go from not knowing who you are to, oh, hey, this person, I kind of like them. They know what they're talking about.

[00:03:14.900] - Sandra
They do something that's relevant for me to a sale, or not, right, which is also fine.

[00:03:23.250] - Liz
Okay. So, let's keep it simple, let's kind of, because I know we do have a lot of newer bloggers...

[00:03:31.190] - Sandra
Yeah, of course.

[00:03:31.360] - Liz
... attending the Summit. So, we're going to keep it on the simpler side. But let's kind of start with some mistakes you see people make when it comes to copywriting, you know, that isn't going to convert or help make a decision.

[00:03:44.610] - Sandra
Yeah. I think the main thing that I see happen again and again is not daring to be specific. Right. It's that keeping it general, trying to appeal to everyone. And I mean, for bloggers and the newer ones have probably also heard about long tail keywords and get more specific. And you look for that magic SEO juice where it's like, there's a specific group that looks for this and wants to take action, but there's not a lot of competition because it's a longer sort of phrase. Right, that sort of thing. I think that in funnels and in copywriting and in our business and just how we present ourselves, we do our own version of that by infusing, like, standing for something where you know there's so many general things out there that it's by trying to sort of fit in, you kind of get lost in the ocean.

[00:04:33.750] - Liz
Yes. No, I like that. And doesn't necessarily like, yes, you want to stand for something in terms of what your business does, but doesn't necessarily have to be just about that. It could be, you know, what's going on in the world and you have a, you know.

[00:04:47.700] - Sandra
You have an opinion. Yeah. And also a thing where I'm, one of my private clients that I am actually doing more coffee for, she loves fantasy and pop culture references. And she had this very generic, hi, I help business owners that are growing by managing their back end. And I'm like, well, that's cool, but also...

[00:05:07.110] - Liz
Functional, but doesn't infuse the personality.

[00:05:09.290] - Sandra
But can we infuse this sort of, right, it's this thing where I've had a person work with me because I love the comedy show Brooklyn nine nine, and I use, like, a Brooklyn nine nine...

[00:05:19.160] - Sandra
Yes.

[00:05:20.020] - Sandra
...Brooklyn nine nine reference with the Giffy, right. And they were like, oh, my God, I love that show. Then two weeks later, they hired me. Right. It's something that's like that.

[00:05:28.860] - Liz
Yes. I use Brooklyn nine nine gifs all the time.

[00:05:32.560] - Sandra
I love them.

[00:05:35.210] - Liz
I have them like saved. I'm like, Amy excited.

[00:05:39.370] - Sandra
Amy knew binders 

[00:05:43.390] - Liz
Okay. Okay. We're going to get back. Okay. All right, so those are some great examples of like mistakes, being specific, standing for something. If you are brand new and you want to set up your first funnel, and maybe it's even just how do I get them to opt into my freebie, not even like getting to a tripwire, like that's another step.

[00:06:01.090] - Sandra
That's a whole different story. Honestly, you talk about it. Don't do what I just did. So, you all missed the part before this thing was like, oh, I have an opt in somewhere and I don't know where it is and I don't really promote it. And apparently, 150 people have somehow found it, right? Yes. It's this thing where you talk about it, you share it. So, my opt ins are short and digestible, but that's true for my templates too. But I do try to bring a level of professionalism and care to the opt in where it could be a paid product, even if it was only a $7 thing. Right, it could be paid.

[00:06:37.170] - Liz
Sure. If they're trying to design like the landing page where the person gets to and they've got to make the decision, am I going to get email address or not? What are the elements they need or should include to make it more likely that they can, you know get the right person to convert?

[00:06:55.900] - Sandra
All right, so my freebie is all about this, so get that. I love that we just went there. I think for me, it's really around like clarity about what it is and what it will help them do. And I love little mini bios. So, often when people teach about bios, it's very much, especially for about bases around. Like, how do I explain to someone that they should definitely buy from me because I understand them? I buy from people that I like, right. So, if you have, I love having like a little snappy bio. Mine used to always say that I love the city London and Golden Retrievers and the show Brooklyn Nine Nine. Right, like that sort of thing. Yeah, just like a little personable thing. Because it's this thing where people that are looking for new things or for opt in, they're opting into everything left and right. So, I think it's the clarity of what it is and what it will help them do. And a little about section to me is always a big bonus.

[00:07:54.230] - Liz
Okay, I like that. And I would say, if you have never had to write your own little mini bio, because I think it's one thing that someone's like, oh, give me your bio. And I'm like when you're new, like, obviously I've been at a while. Go find mini bios everywhere just to give you ideas. And you can be like, oh, I really like that. And it's like, well, what is it about it that you liked about it? Go read an article on a new site even, right, there's little bios.

[00:08:21.860] - Sandra
Yeah, those are typically the kind of boring bios in there. It's like, what do I like? What do I not like? How would I, you know, or even this thing around like, oh, if I was writing about a bio about my sister, my partner, my job, what would I write? And that was, right? And then do that for yourself, too.

[00:08:39.350] - Liz
Yes. And I would say like, take this a little bit. I don't think we're playing talk about bios, but I think it's one thing that is so important that people do struggle with. I would say take a day and write a bunch and then like make different versions. Like a long version, a short version, a medium version, a version that kind of focuses on this aspect of that aspect. That's actually something I did earlier this year. I set it up in like, so I used to look up where I was like, here's my medium blogging focus bio. Here's my long blogging focus bio...

[00:09:12.690] - Sandra
You're so organized.

[00:09:13.630] - Liz
...here's my legal bio, here's my, you know, for my personal finance site. Here's the finance focus where I've been featured in these, you know like.

[00:09:21.970] - Sandra
The mini version of this is I have an Apple note that has a few of the lines that you just read at the beginning. And that's my bio. But I have it on my list to create like a bio template with little formulas and different versions for my template shop. And I just keep not getting around to it.

[00:09:35.530] - Liz
Yes. I finally like really managed to get my ish together. There's still things I'm working on, right? In large part because of another speaker at the summit and like process trading, but I would highly recommend doing that. That way you can go and grab it. You know where it's at. I also did it, so my VA could grab it, you know. It's just handy to not have to constantly dig up what did I submit to the last time, someone asked me for a bio?

[00:10:04.810] - Sandra
Right, yes.

[00:10:05.180] - Liz
That's for a long time, s. Okay, so I love that. So, landing page, you want to be clear, you want to provide the result that's going to get them, and you want to include a mini bio, so that they can start like you.

[00:10:16.700] - Sandra
And a mock up. We always want to see what we're getting, so we want a mock up image, for sure.

[00:10:23.590] - Liz
I like it. like it doesn't have to be super long or complicated.

[00:10:30.490] - Sandra
No, mine is super short. I think it's this thing where I always joke that if you can explain it simply, you probably don't understand it well enough.

[00:10:44.830] - Liz
Yes, I like that. Yeah.

[00:10:52.910] - Sandra
It's a free thing. If you need to scroll 20 times on a long form page to convince someone to get your free thing, it's not the right thing for the right person.

[00:11:02.870] - Liz
Okay. Now for those that are maybe a little more advanced and working on setting up that tripwire or that one time offer, or that, you know, whatever phrase you want to use because you like the context of it better than tripwire, you know, that's got to be a little bit longer. You're asking them to hand over money. You know I assume you're going to include really the same kind of stuff that you're including in the free version, you know, the freebie. But what else do you need when you're looking at that, you know?

[00:11:31.470] - Sandra
So, mine are really like a short sales page, like a mini sales page, right? I think that's something that a lot of people forget or kind of hide. I want that confirmation that the thing they opted in for, it's on its way, right. So, I want that job thing not to be like, hey, here's a special one time offer. Yes, we have that. But first, we have a hey, you're in, hey, your guide is on its way to your inbox right now, and in the meantime, I have a special offer for you. Right?

[00:12:00.810] - Liz
Okay.

[00:12:01.110] - Sandra
So, to make it clear that the thing that they actually opted in for and did succeeded at work, I think that's very very important, right? That we show the person, like, hey, we got you, and also, here's a special little offer.

[00:12:14.970] - Liz
Okay. I like that because I definitely feel like sometimes, not often, it's rare where I've opted into something I'm taking to a sales page, but I don't think I ever actually managed to get the free thing.

[00:12:24.830] - Sandra
Right. It's weird, it's like, where's my, but you promise, right? And I think it's the thing where there's so many skeezed people out there that we don't even realize if we copy what other people are doing, we don't even realize that we're doing something that's a little bit weird. And I've recently had it where someone will upsell you, and they say something, right? You buy a thing, and then they try to sell you something more expensive or something else, and they go like, your order is incomplete. And that is BS. Right. It's not true. You already paid. You're getting your thing. They're just making you another offer. So, it's that sort of thing. It's, like, confirmed that, hey, everything's cool. Right? But also, I have something special for you.

[00:13:04.650] - Liz
No, I love, especially because upsells, because it does go through.

[00:13:08.460] - Sandra
Of course.

[00:13:10.250] - Liz
You know like, they're like, it's incomplete, and so it's like you have to hit no thing, something.

[00:13:14.570] - Sandra
Yeah. And even if you leave 30 minutes later, depending on the system with Thrive Cart, 30 minutes later, the order gets passed, you get your things. It's fine.

[00:13:22.750] - Liz
Yeah, so just being upfront and honest, I think is the best way.

[00:13:27.620] - Sandra
Yeah. But also, it's also a part of customer service, right? It's like, hey, no matter what you choose to do next, the first thing, we got you there. And other than that, I think it's very much the same. For Tripwire, I want to see a good deal. I don't want 20% off. I want 50% off. Otherwise, I'm not going to get up and get my credit card details out of my purse. I think it's like that. I think it's that. And what it could also be is that it's really like an offer that's not available anywhere else, right? So, maybe you don't do a big discount. You do, hey, this offer is truly not available anywhere else.

[00:14:03.470] - Liz
I do like that. Okay. All right. Now, if you are getting more compared, because you did mention it, or you're trying to do like, an upsell. So we already know. Be honest, don't be skeedy. Let me think about how I phrase this question. When do you think an upsell works best?

[00:14:27.990] - Sandra
I think an upsell at some point is just a statistic.

[00:14:31.270] - Liz
Okay.

[00:14:32.470] - Sandra
So, I think that when it comes to funnels, you can get highly strategic. And I have an amazing friend who's very highly strategic with this, and she'll go like, this offer has this exact upsell because of this reason. And we'll do customized copy and, at the same time, what you aside from the really strategic, highly specialized funnel expert people, right? These are funnel strategists I'm talking about. It comes back down to statistics. So, this thing where if 1% conversion is the industry average, you might see that over time, you kind of converge towards that. So, it's this thing where on my template, I have the same upsell on everything, because I said at one upsell page, and I tacked it on everything just before Black Friday. It's like, well, we'll see. Whatever. I haven't bought it yet, right? And that's fine, because not enough people have seen that page to make that mean anything. And I chose to do, like, a higher ticket. It's a self study course, right? And it's discounted, but it's still expensive. It's a significant investment, and there's not a payment plan. You can only pay in one go.

[00:15:37.420] - Sandra
And the reasoning with that is kind of like, well, you can go lower ticket and maybe get a higher ConvertKit rate, but if you sell something expensive, you only need to sell it once to still make five times more money, right. So, it's that sort of thing of upsell, what you have, right? I wouldn't go and create something specific. And I've actually had it where someone signed up for my group program and bought the self study version of my other program, and it was ugly. It was so ugly. And you know, there's no way this is not, like, statistically appropriate because the sign up group was so small. But I was like, oh, if from now on, 20% of the people will go and buy this ugly ass up to help for $500. So, don't go creating things from scratch if you have a complimentary thing that they might also like.

[00:16:37.790] - Liz
Okay, no, I do like that. So, one thing I want to go back because you said not enough people have seen this for me to know if it works or not.

[00:16:46.370] - Sandra
Yeah.

[00:16:47.890] - Liz
Because you won't know if your copy is good, necessarily. I mean, sometimes you could tell to a certain extent, and I'd love to get into that, but how do you track it? What is enough people in order to tell if something is working or not?

[00:17:02.060] - Sandra
I mean, for an opt in page, if 50 people have seen it and no one's downloaded it, you have a problem. You have for sure a problem. For a paid product, if it's had 100 unique visitors, I would expect at least one sale.

[00:17:16.390] - Liz
Okay.

[00:17:17.530] - Sandra
And you know, I'm a copywriter. I see above average conversion rates on almost everything, but whenever clients are feeling kind of upset or disappointed by a launch result or this or that, I go like, well, how much traffic did you get to a page? Right? How many individual people? And then it's like, oh, look, 2% conversion rate. That's actually pretty standard, right?

[00:17:38.150] - Liz
Yes.

[00:17:38.840] - Sandra
So, for an opt in page, it really depends. There's really amazing people with really targeted, engaged audiences. They get 60 or 70% conversion on a freebie. I don't even know what mine is because I don't even track it. Come on to my newsletter. Eventually, there's a sale, or you'll find you'll buy something that's cool, right? I don't really care where you came from, as long as you come, okay. Which is maybe don't do as I say. I do it. But that's how I kind of look at life, and my business go like, well, I can't do everything perfectly, so what can I do when I run with that?

[00:18:13.810] - Liz
Okay, if you find that, you know, it's not working, do you have any tips on identifying what part of the page is the problem?

[00:18:22.690] - Sandra
This is so hard.

[00:18:25.170] - Liz
No, I'm sorry.

[00:18:26.550] - Sandra
I would say get a heat map, but honestly, I've had one offer going out this year that made zero sales. That has never, ever happened to me, ever. And it was just before Black Friday, and it was high ticket, and I was like, well, is everyone saving their money for Black Friday? Is everyone listening to the talk about inflation? Is it just not a good offer? And I knew the positioning wasn't right. It was more like a last hallelujah. Halfway through, I decided I was going to scrap the offer and turn it into something else anyway, because the positioning has never been right. But it's almost impossible to pivot point. I think that even beyond just saying the page where the copy is working, the question is also, like, do you have a sales problem or a lead problem or an actual messaging problem? That's really hard to say, because if ten people look at your offer and no one buys it, that doesn't really tell me that the copy is wrong. That tells me you probably have a traffic or conversion problem in getting people to click.

[00:19:31.620] - Liz
Okay.

[00:19:33.590] - Sandra
So, it's really tricky.

[00:19:35.760] - Liz
Okay. Yeah.

[00:19:36.600] - Liz
And everyone, I asked a very broad question. You gave me a good answer. 

[00:19:42.570] - Sandra
Because I was like, oh, no, like, sweaty armpits over here.

[00:19:47.450] - Liz
It is. Everyone's going to be, the answer is really always, it depends. But you gave some great examples.

[00:19:54.050] - Sandra
I think heat map is a good place to sort of start, honestly. I know I should have them. I don't. But if you're looking at that, then go there. But the thing with that is, like, this is ironic because it kind of devalues the work and what I do. And I will say that again. Me and most of my clients get way above average conversion rates. Right? The ugliest, most basic, bitch, stupid, spammy, ugly, crappy website out there, I don't know if I can swear, I think I just did, sorry, will still get a 1% conversion rate. As long as 100 people land on it, someone will somehow buy it. That's kind of like a weird law of nature. So, this thing to me is like, if I get 100 people on it and no one buys it, then I know something's not right.

[00:20:41.920] - Liz
Okay. Got it. And you talk about sort of messaging and positioning. Because I think that is I mean, I know that's something that I've not done well in the past and probably am still not doing well in a lot of places, but can you kind of explain what that is for people that are like, what are you talking about?

[00:21:03.890] - Sandra
I think there's kind of two ways to approach it, right. Part of it is messaging and positioning is something that I do about my business. And a much bigger part is what you think about me and my business and what you think I do. Right. So, messaging is very much the outward thing. Okay. My company is called Damn Copy. If you're strictly religious, which is cool, like, I go to church sometimes, you're more than welcome to come, but you might be offended by me. It's fine. Right. So that's like a messaging and a positioning thing around who I am as a person and as a business and as a business owner. It's like bold to the point. I don't want long drawn out processes. Right. It's all that sort of just kind of combined in a name, and then you see the branding. It all kind of works together in a cohesive kind of way. But it's not as much as I say what it is. It's what other people say about me.

[00:21:58.950] - Liz
Okay. How it's perceived.

[00:22:02.570] - Sandra
Yeah. It's what other people say about you is probably more important than what you say about yourself. And at the same time, you have agency. Right. You have a part where you can show up. I feel like in some ways, for me, messaging is more specific about the offer and how it helps a specific person, right. So, it's around who is it for and why should they care. If you want to improve any of your copy for anything holding on this, who's it for, why should they give a fuck? I think that's literally the essence of what I do.

[00:22:38.210] - Liz
Okay. I like that.

[00:22:40.610] - Sandra
Yeah. 

[00:22:41.941] - Liz
Simple. You said if you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it.

[00:22:45.110] - Sandra
Yeah.

[00:22:46.310] - Liz
Okay. So, we are starting to run short on time, and I know you do have an awesome freebie for the attendees. You want to tell us a little bit about it?

[00:22:55.830] - Sandra
Yeah, of course. So, I have a mystery PDF checklist on what you need for a high converting landing page. So, it's very much about what we talked about. It's beautifully branded PDF. I actually read it the other day because, honestly, I forget I have this kind of stuff. I'm the most disorganized, chaotic business owner. You've heard it, right? Oh, you should have a heat map. I don't have it. But you should have one.

[00:23:18.080] - Liz
I don't have it either. I'm slowly getting organized, but same boat. Sometimes you look back and you're like, man, that's so good. I should really do more with that.

[00:23:26.530] - Sandra
Yeah. So, I will say go and download that because it's probably a summary, and it will have some different things that we talked about. And the other thing is, I have a general newsletter sign up on my website. So, if you're just, like, send your team school. I want to be in her world. Go over to the site, pop in your email. You'll start getting my weekly newsletters. Because I think the thing that I really want to want you to take away from this is that there's a lot of things we can do to fine tune and to perfect and to maybe improve conversion with a tiny little bit. Until you come to a place where half a percentage point in conversion rate matters a lot to your sale, I would much rather have you focus on things that get you in front of more people, get you more traffic, make more offers. How do you figure out the messaging? You figure out what people respond to. Right? So, I would say go and do imperfect things and get more offers out there over. Put in a heat map and try to get 2% more opt in.

[00:24:25.890] - Sandra
It's like, no, go tell an extra thousand people about your optin.

[00:24:29.180] - Liz
Yes. Done is done. Perfect. Go get something done.

[00:24:32.340] - Sandra
Exactly.

[00:24:33.590] - Liz
Yes. All right. Definitely, go check that out, guys. Sandra, thank you so much again. I really appreciate it. I learned a lot. I've made a lot of notes. Just thank you for being here.

[00:24:43.790] - Sandra
Of course. Thank you so much for having me.
