Hi. Welcome to How to Use Video in Your Blog, the secrets to making your blog stand out by incorporating video. On today's agenda, we will be discussing the advantages of using video some shocking to six and of course, how to use video in your blog. But first, a little bit about me, I'm a wife, girl mom, and video marketing strategist. I empower creative entrepreneurs to show up confidently on camera, stand out and attract their ideal clients by creating a profitable video marketing blueprint for them.

But first, a little bit about me, I'm a wife, girl mom, and video marketing strategist. I empower creative entrepreneurs just like yourself to show confidently on camera, stand out and attract their ideal clients by creating a profitable video marketing blueprint for them. What does that even mean, India? That means that I'm your go to person when you're ready to grow your business using video.

[00:01:15.720] - India
Whether that's YouTube social media webinars updating the video on your website sales pages with video Pinterest. As you can see, the opportunities with video are limitless. Why should you incorporate video into your blog? First, it increases the time spent on your blog. Why does the time spent on your blog even matter?

[00:01:40.110] - India
It honestly shows a few things. The first is that it shows that your reader is engaged. It's proving that your content is resonating with them and that it's relevant. It helps you to reach new audiences. So, as you're creating video content, hopefully you are putting that video content on YouTube.

[00:02:01.590] - India
So, you're taking advantage of the SEO. So that kind of brings me into my third point. Search engines love video. Have you watched a YouTube video lately that's been timestamped?

[00:02:12.370] - India
If you look at that timestamp, it actually pops up on Google. Now I'm not sure when exactly that feature started. That's a really cool feature. So, if you're you know let's say you're doing a tutorial or unboxing and you put on there at such and such minute and second, that's automatically going to pop on Google.

[00:02:33.060] - India
That's pretty cool. Another reason why is that it establishes the like, know and trust factor faster. So, when someone sees you on camera, I always say this, but your energy is magnetic. When they see your face, they're like, wow, it's really a real person behind the person that's writing this blog. And then lastly, video in your blog helps you to outshine your competitor.

[00:02:57.950] - India
I'm pretty sure that your competitor is not taking advantage of using video in their blog. So, if someone is looking for exactly what you're writing about and you have video on your blog, that's just going to make them want to subscribe to your blog or keep writing your content to follow you on your social media accounts and everything else. It just makes you a better choice. So, let's talk about some shocking statistics because they really are shocking. Readers spent an average of 2.6 more time on blogs with video than those without. 72% of customers said that they would rather learn about a product or service by way of video.

[00:03:48.810] - India
One in four bloggers add video in their blog, so that goes back to outshining your competitor. Only one in four bloggers that's not a lot at all. Blogs with video are 50 times more likely to drive organic search traffic than plain text. Get rolling with video. So, how do you even get started with video?

[00:04:12.250] - India
How do you incorporate a video in a blog post? So, I have six ways that you can do this. The first way is a tutorial. This is my favorite. I think this will be the easiest for you to get started with.

[00:04:26.580] - India
Let's say you are a mom blogger and you are showing how to put together a swing or stroller or some type of product instead of listing out the steps of how to do what it is, how to do what you're writing about. Shoot a quick video. It's so much more. I know if I came to a blog and I always do on Pinterest, I've seen a blog that had video showing me how to do it, I'm much more likely to continue watching and continue reading the blog. Another way to incorporate video into your blog are reviews.

[00:05:06.670] - India
So, if you are reviewing a product or service, testimonials and reviews on camera are so much more effective on video than it is just written, unboxing or halls. If you are a fashion blogger, this is great. Instead of showing a million pictures, you can actually show how the clothing fits. Another way is a Vlog. So, if you had a blog post about a day in the life, or you took a trip to the zoo with your kids, or whatever the blog post may be, you can just shoot the content, make it a 30 or 60 second video of a day in the life of what it is to you.

[00:05:53.150] - India
Or another way that you can incorporate video into your blog is by repurposing old blogs into new blogs. But this time adding video. Lastly, if you're just getting started with your blog, you can shoot a quick introduction. How great would that be if a reader is just stumbling across your block, instead of reading a two or three minute blog post, wouldn't it be nice to introduce yourself on camera? Let them know what your blog is going to be about how many times a week you post blogs, etcetera.

[00:06:26.170] - India
Like I said, it establishes that like no and trust factor so much faster with video. So that is all. Thank you so much for your attention today. I really hope that this resonated with you. I hope you walked away with some golden nuggets.
