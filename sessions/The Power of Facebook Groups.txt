[00:00:10.150] - Liz Stapleton, Summit Host
All right, guys, I'm super excited for today's session with Tracie Fobes, who previously owned Penny Pinchin Mom, super successful blog, sold it in 2019 and now really focuses on helping bloggers succeed. Tracie, thank you so much and welcome.

[00:00:24.070] - Tracie Fobes, traciefobes.com
Thanks for having me. I'm really excited to be here today and talk about one of my favorite topics.

[00:00:28.660] - Liz
Yeah. Because so I'm in a ton of Facebook groups actually have a couple, but I'm not super good at them, so I'm really excited for your topic. So do you just want to kind of give us a quick overview of some of the things we're going to cover today?

[00:00:41.920] - Tracie
Absolutely. So everybody seems to say Facebook is dead and nobody should be on Facebook. Well, I tend to disagree with that. Facebook can still be a very powerful platform, but you have to know how to use it. Long gone are the days where you would put something on your Facebook page and everybody would see it. Now, Facebook has shifted to where your page is really kind of your calling card, it's kind of that, "welcome. Here's a little bit about me."

[00:01:08.470] - Tracie
The magic that happens when Facebook takes place within your groups. And that's where we see growth and income and some amazing things happening. So I think every single person who's out there that has any sort of an online presence really needs to consider having a Facebook group. We'll talk about how we get started and a couple of tricks to maybe get it to grow. And what in the world do you do in a Facebook group?

[00:01:34.600] - Liz
Awesome. And I am just going to throw in that there is a Facebook group for the Summit, so you should join that.

[00:01:40.570] - Liz
And I'll be taking some of Tracie's tips to, like, make it even better. OK, so because it is different in running a Facebook group as opposed to being in some elses and participating, and different rules and stuff. So what are some sort of dos and don'ts of running your own Facebook group?

[00:01:57.640] - Tracie
So you really want to make sure that you decide if it's going to be an open group or a closed group. So an open group is one... Anybody can come in, they can join, they can leave as they want. You have no control over who's there, who's not.

[00:02:11.080] - Tracie
I don't recommend that kind of group.

[00:02:12.700] - Tracie
OK, but the closed group is where they answer questions. And I'm sure you've all probably joined those groups and they're asking these questions and all these different things. And you're thinking, how did they do that? They did a closed group.

[00:02:24.700] - Tracie
So the closed group just allows you to have a little more control. It can let you know the people that maybe joined Facebook last week. You know, though, people who maybe are less than savory that you want to have in your group, you're not sure about their intentions.

[00:02:38.980] - Tracie
So that's probably one of my biggest things, is just to know who's coming in and to kind of control that. One other thing I really love about the Facebook group, one of my favorite tricks is that your questions, you can say, would you like to be on my email list? If so, drop your email address right here. So while they are joining your group, you also have this amazing opportunity to collect and add that person directly to your email list.

[00:03:08.860] - Tracie
So it gives you a double opportunity where, great, if they don't want to maybe partake in my group very much, maybe  they're not active, they'll at least see all my emails. So it's a double win situation. So that's probably one of my favorite things about running a group.

[00:03:23.470] - Tracie
Now, the other thing we have to remember as an administrator is people aren't just going to come in and just start talking. When you're in those groups where everybody's talking, everybody's engaging. That didn't happen by magic.

[00:03:34.480] - Tracie
The administrator. You're going to have to get in there. You're going to feel like you are talking to nobody, talking to your four year old who's watching Paw Patrol and not listening to you. Right. It's going to be that same feeling that there's crickets going on. But we use engagement techniques. We don't just post a link to our latest blog post. We ask engaging in questions. One of my favorites is you put up something fun because let's face it, we all need to escape what's going on in the world around us.

[00:04:05.530] - Tracie
Right? We just need to just enjoy life once in a while. So are you Team apple or banana? Something that simple can get people engaged. Then you start asking questions, not open ended, like, what are you doing this weekend? No, what are you doing this weekend? Answer with Gif and then they will put a Gif in there and everybody can get engaged and it makes them start feeling like they were a part of your community.

[00:04:31.990] - Tracie
So those are a couple of things that I like to recommend to my administrators of Facebook groups.

[00:04:37.090] - Liz
Yeah, no, I. I love responding with Gifs or however you say it.

[00:04:42.070] - Tracie
I don't know how you say it either.

[00:04:42.790] - Liz
I suck at using emojis. Give me a Gif any day.

[00:04:47.260] - Tracie
Exactly. Exactly. I'm the same way. It's like and people love to do that because there's so many funny ones. And I honestly love it too, because I see some of the funniest ones I've never seen before and like, oh my gosh, where did you find that one? And I'm just dying laughing.

[00:05:02.350] - Tracie
So, you know, as an administrator, we have to make our people feel welcome.

[00:05:08.810] - Tracie
And we have to make them, give them a reason to be there, it's not just, oh, come into my group because we're going to have great recipes, alright recipes, schmecipes. You know, that's boring, right? There has to be something happening there that makes them want to join, that makes them want to be able to show up every day and like log into Facebook and the first place they go is your group.

[00:05:31.070] - Liz
Yeah. So I love those suggestions of, like, what the administrator can post. Do you have any tips on how to get other people to start conversations themselves? I mean, you are going to feel like you're talking to a wall for a bit, but when does that tide shift and do group rules play into that? What?

[00:05:49.170] - Tracie
Yeah. And so, yeah, it could take a little time. The group rules are a big part. And so within your rules, you might not allow links, you might have certain things they can or cannot do.

[00:05:59.420] - Tracie
But what you can do is.... You can, when you start asking those questions and I will do that a lot of  times, so it's like, OK, because I run a blogging group, but you can kind of shift this same idea to any group you're running. So let's say you run a photography group and it's all about how to take better pictures on your iPhone. And so you can say, OK, what is your... The one thing you hate about, you know, your pictures or are your pictures blurry or you finding that you can never take a selfie the right way?

[00:06:31.610] - Tracie
You know, you can have people to ask those types of questions and they can start asking and then you respond. And then when you start responding, people see that, oh, my gosh, this person is going to show up. They're going to answer my questions... So you can do that.

[00:06:47.390] - Tracie
Another really cool trick is when you have new members come in. Facebook has this incredible feature that they've built into every group. And you can send a welcome message because you've seen those where they welcome all their new members and they tag everybody.

[00:07:02.410] - Tracie
You're like, how in the world do they do that? Well they didn't sit down and research it themselves. Let me tell you that, there is a little button you can click, that says "welcome your new members" when you welcome them in, they instantly feel like, oh, I get to be here, ask them to tell a little bit about themselves or why are they in your group? Get them to try to engage from the get go and they'll be more likely to ask those questions and engage within your community going forward because they don't feel like they joined the space, that nobody cares if they're there.

[00:07:33.590] - Tracie
They want you to care that they took the time to show up. So that's on our shoulders to make them feel like they are a part of our community and give them that reason again to come in every day, ask their questions and want to help others.

[00:07:50.420] - Liz
OK, yeah. No, and I, I do like you. I did start doing that with the Summit last year with Facebook group. And again it was like the first time I'd really run a Facebook group in years. But I do kind of want to go back to the rules because we've all been part of those groups where they're just junk, like they're junk. And you don't want that to happen. Like you're trying to cultivate a strong community, which is where all the other good stuff comes from.

[00:08:16.020] - Liz
So what are some good ground rules to set or to think about and maybe even some better some other questions besides for email address that might help set the tone?

[00:08:26.180] - Tracie
Oh, great question. So one thing that's really awesome is that Facebook has set rules that you can just literally say, I want to show Facebook rules, but some of them are: you have to have respect for everybody. You cannot use profanity, those types of things, which are kind of a given.

[00:08:44.330] - Tracie
But some of them I like to add in there is that we don't allow for self promotion because you'll have those people who come in and all they do is self promote.

[00:08:51.900] - Tracie
Oh, my gosh, it's horrible they come and all they want to do is share their link everywhere and they start spamming like crazy. So you can have some rules about link sharing or sharing your own links and how that works. You can also put rules about maybe you want to allow people to share links, but you don't want them to use their own referral or affiliate links. You can have that kind of a stipulation in there to where we are allowed to help answer questions.

[00:09:15.230] - Tracie
But you cannot share your own affiliate link. Other things that I will do is why do you want to be in my group?

[00:09:22.950] - Tracie
And I have a multiple-choice on mine, and it helps me weed it out because my questions, I have people who come in and they answer all four questions like I want to be in for all four of these reasons. Well, you're not coming in because you're a brand new blogger and you don't know what you're doing and you've been blogging for years and want to help those two things do not go together. So when someone answers all four of those, I instantly know you're not here for the right reason. So you can do that.

[00:09:48.450] - Tracie
Another thing that you can do is, where did you hear about me? And so you can use that, a great opportunity that you could put in there- is are you here because of my free course? If not, and you can tell them where your course is at and have an answer, a yes or no, so you can actually advertise something else that's outside of Facebook to maybe say, oh, you have a free course. That's really cool. So, no, I'm not here because that but I'm going to go find it now so you can use that as well.

[00:10:19.380] - Tracie
But you set these rules in place because the rules help you control the group and it gives you that instant way to remove somebody if they do something you don't like. So I have people who come in all the time and the very first post they make is they post a link to their site. You get zero...

[00:10:39.180] - Liz
Zero tolerance.

[00:10:40.350] - Tracie
That's it. You did it the first time. You literally just agreed to my terms. That said, you will not post a link and the very first thing you did was post a link.So guess what? Bye bye. You're gone.

[00:10:50.580] - Tracie
So it, it really gives you that opportunity to do that. One other thing that's really great for administrators is if you do have to remove somebody's content, you can go in Facebook will give you, what, like a little box that says, why are you removing this? And you can toggle whichever rule they violated and you can even share that rule with the person. So they know you took this down because it was self promotional or you we took this down because it was being confrontational or it was being rude and it just is kind of their warning.

[00:11:24.480] - Liz
Yeah.

[00:11:24.990] - Tracie
And that way then it just kind of gives you a little more control. But those are some of the rules. I put in...

[00:11:29.850] - Liz
I feel like you would use that for someone who has been in your group while has engaged, has been a good community member. They just made a mistake. Right. Like, you know, but the people that come in, just dropping links... Like I...so, one thing I see with a lot of people is they don't want people to not like them. And so they hesitate, they don't want to kick anyone out. They're like I'm trying to grow this. Why would I kick people out? Kick people out. Don't feel bad about it. It is your space. Control it. So I just wanted to add that.

[00:12:00.090] - Tracie
Yeah, it's kind of like a business. If you were out to dinner somewhere and there was somebody in the table next to you and they were being belligerent would the owner, let them just stay there because they don't want to lose that customer, or would they go and tell them they had to leave? Chances are they would tell that one person to leave so as to not to upset the other 50 people in the room, it's the same thing with your group.

[00:12:20.940] - Tracie
You can't try to appease one person and potentially alienate hundreds or thousands of others. So you don't owe them anything, literally not a thing. They don't like it. That's their fault. They violated your rules. I am not here to make friends. I'm running a business. And while I try to blend the two, there are times where I do have to separate them and put on my business hat and say, you know what, this isn't personal. It's business.

[00:12:48.090] - Liz
Yes, yes. No, I like that. I just want to touch on that.

[00:12:52.530] - Tracie
Oh yeah. No, it's a great point to bring up for sure.

[00:12:56.010] - Liz
OK, so we talked about engaging and setting rules. At what point, how long, how long does it tend to take for things to kind of start to take off? If you're being consistent, if you're showing up, what, how, what kind of is a you can you expect?

[00:13:13.440] - Tracie
So I see it seems that once you hit this, seven hundred to a thousand members in your group is where things start to happen.

[00:13:23.760] - Tracie
So up until that time, it could be crickets and it could be just you. But you still need to show up every single day. You still need to engage people. You need to make sure that you are getting more people to join your group, that you're not just saying, OK, well, no one's there talking. I'm just it was a bust. Give it time, because people aren't just going to come in there, start talking.

[00:13:48.720] - Tracie
But that's what it seems like. I'm starting I've watched groups and that kind of seems to be that magic number. When we start getting that many members, then there's enough people in there where someone's not afraid to ask a question. And that's all it takes. It takes one person being willing to come in and ask something and that gets other people talking. Now, one tool or trick you can use for this is you can use your family and friends.

[00:14:17.100] - Tracie
So you could ask them, could you go in and start asking questions and things. And that can maybe encourage other people to start to do the same, so don't be afraid to ask them to do you a favor.

[00:14:28.060] - Liz
Yeah, no, I like that. I do want to ask so we want to show up, but I definitely see Facebook groups where you can tell it's automated. And so every Monday they post the thing of like motivation Monday, you know, and every Tuesday this and every Wednesday it's this...

[00:14:45.160] - Liz
And there's something nice about that in some ways. But it's like. I kind of a lot of times I ignore them because it's like they're not really engaging with me.

[00:14:54.990] - Tracie
Right, it's not genuine. You know, it's like these these groups where it's like you said, it's like it's like motivation Monday, you know, what are we going to do this week? That's not real because you're not showing up and asking that. And people can tell. And the other way they can tell is just, again, if you're seeing the same thing every Monday or they can see where it's coming from, if you're using an external app, it'll say, posted by MeetEdgar or whatever, and that's like a dead giveaway, that that's what you're doing.

[00:15:22.890] - Tracie
So I understand the premise of that. But I have never used those because I just feel that they're not engaging enough. And in most cases, let's say it's you're in a Facebook group where you can share your latest blog post. That's what they allow is on Tuesdays. It's a self promotional day. For what? Nobody clicks on. It is like everybody just drops their link and runs. Think about what you're doing. Are you dropping your link and helping other people look?

[00:15:51.420] - Tracie
Are you engaging with others? Because in most cases they're not. And so it's just kind of a... Of link farm for lack of a better description. And it's not

[00:16:01.440] - Liz
I like that description, actually.

[00:16:03.660] - Tracie
It's not really doing anything for you. It's just. Just like it doesn't help, it just it doesn't at all. Another one of those I hate with every ounce of my being is share your Facebook group and follow at least five others. The problem with that is we should only follow the pages we want to engage with. Just following random pages just because you want to get more people on yours doesn't help anybody because we need our pages still to grow.

[00:16:30.800] - Tracie
And so and a side caveat here, that if you have people who aren't going to engage with your page, it hurts you. I could add one hundred people and none of them want to look or engage with my content. That hurts me where I can have maybe 10 people who are more interested and Facebook is going to like that.

[00:16:45.860] - Tracie
It's the same thing with our group. We only want people in our groups that want to be there. We don't want to just have people just for the sake of numbers, because it's not just a numbers game, it's an engagement game. So I don't recommend those. I really don't, because they do feel very impersonal. They feel like you aren't really trying to be helpful. And it's the same thing with even auto posting links to your content.

[00:17:12.140] - Tracie
I will share a link once in a while and I make it personal, like, hey, we just had a few questions in here about, you know, trying to start with SEO. Here's this great article I shared below. It might help some more of you. That kind of a thing, or it's like, you know, we're all talking about Thanksgiving and everybody's been sharing some Thanksgiving recipes. I've got this great roundup of my favorite 25 Thanksgiving side dishes that might be helpful.

[00:17:36.680] - Tracie
That's not being promotional. It's not on autopilot. It is you engaging with what's happening within your group. So... I get it. But I just don't know if they are really as effective as a lot of the administrators tend to think that they are.

[00:17:53.840] - Liz
Ok. And kind of following up on that, then, because as bloggers are to-do lists are a mile long.

[00:18:00.510] - Tracie
Right.

[00:18:00.940] - Liz
So adding like Facebook group and like where you're not , how do you kind of the time management aspect in the planning aspect of that? Tips?

[00:18:11.230] - Tracie
Yeah, I get it. So I recommend you use the internal Facebook scheduler, so you can still make your content very genuine by typing it instead of just auto posting that same image every Monday, which you can come in there and you can schedule out your content.

[00:18:28.000] - Tracie
You also could bring in an administrator to help you and that can be a member on your team. Maybe it's a virtual assistant you have and you can just add that as another position or thing that they take care of and they kind of help run your group. You also if you don't have that type of a position, what I did on my Facebook group with the site that I sold is I found two very active members in my community and I offered them an opportunity to earn some money by helping to run my group.

[00:19:01.960] - Tracie
So they understood what I was doing. They knew how to answer a question. They knew what to do to engage people. And they just split the week and they each worked so many days a week and ran my group. So that's another option is to maybe hire it out. And you want to pay a lot like the women that were running my group, they were like, well, I would just rather get like Amazon gift cards, I'm like score. I will pay you an Amazon gift card girl.

[00:19:25.690] - Tracie
So that was an easy win for me because they want to shop on Amazon. So I was able just to send them a gift card each week and they were happy with that. But ... Look within that community or hire some of that out because we can't be everywhere and we can't show up all of the time. And so it might be better for you to hire that out. Now I will say you're going to have to show up for a little while.

[00:19:49.360] - Tracie
You can't outsource that until your community starts to get a little engagement. You're going to have to show up. Once that happens, then you can consider bringing somebody in to help run your group.

[00:20:01.570] - Liz
OK, no, I like that so because not every blogger is going to have the budget for that is something, is starting a Facebook group, maybe not something you suggest doing at the beginning.

[00:20:11.590] - Tracie
Yeah, I would not.

[00:20:13.600] - Tracie
So when we're when you're just getting started, you are being pulled ten different ways from Sunday. And so your focus has to happen systematically. So I recommend that first six months, I wouldn't even think about a Facebook group. I really wouldn't. I would focus on learning the ins and outs of running your blog. That means learning your platform. And I would learn you know, Pinterest because Pinterest is an easy one for us to use. I would focus heavily on my SEO and that's your search engine optimization.

[00:20:43.930] - Tracie
And I would also work on building my email list because then you can start emailing that list. And what's really awesome is so if you built your list and you get people there, once you add that group at, at month eight, nine or 10, you already have a group of people who love your emails and you have a group of people right there who are going to funnel right over into your group.

[00:21:05.890] - Tracie
So it's not like you're starting this group from scratch and nobody knows about it. You have instant audience who will more than likely click and join your group. And that might... Because they've seen you when they come over and they join, they already feel like they know who you are. They will be more likely to be the people who start talking the first and engaging people the soonest.

[00:21:28.600] - Liz
OK, no, I like that. I've got like all sorts of wheels turning on the on the Blogger Breakthrough Summit group. OK, so we've covered kind of when to start and how to, how to grow things and engage what sort of... How, we talk about how Facebook group can help you increase your revenue, how?

[00:21:53.320] - Tracie
Much that's like everybody is, we come down to probably the reason most people are here, like I want a group because I want to make more money.

[00:21:59.470] - Tracie
That's what we are all doing this, so our group can be beneficial in a few different ways. Like the first one I said is your email, you can grab them when they first come in, but then you can also, if you have free courses through email like you do this email funnels or these challenges, you can share your email list every once in a while.

[00:22:19.000] - Tracie
I've actually taken an email that I've sent and I will post a link to it. Like this was my email. I just said, here's what you're missing out on. Here's how you can sign up. So they can see right there, because my list is where I sell to people. Right? I'm selling right in there. So that's one opportunity. Another thing you can do is there are affiliate programs all over the place, and as long as your program allows for it, you can post a link to a product right in your group.

[00:22:46.570] - Tracie
I will find discounts on services that I know my people are interested in and I will just pop in there like, oh, my gosh, you guys, this book I know you've been looking at, it's twenty dollars off right now and I put a link right there, a caveat real quick and just nobody can do this for Amazon in a closed group. So let's just put that out there. OK, so I will put that in there. I do my...

[00:23:11.380] - Tracie
Exactly. Yeah. You have to have your disclosure and your disclosure justs need to state that this is an affiliate link. That's basically what you have to put in there, FTC requirements. So don't try to not do it.

[00:23:21.530] - Liz
We will, we'll dive more on that in our legal sessions. We've got a lot of great Attorneys speaking.

[00:23:26.620] - Tracie
OK, then. The other thing you can do is you can post links to your articles that maybe have affiliates in them. So these are the ways it's just another traffic source. It's another way to get people like drive them where you want them to click. And so we want them to click on an affiliate link. We put it in front of them. We want them to click on this post to help, which is full of affiliate links. We put it in front of them.

[00:23:50.980] - Tracie
So those are the ways that we can make money directly through our sites. Now, if you have your own products, what I do a lot of times is I'll grab one of my products and I'll put it on sale like, hey, I've got an exclusive discount only for the members of my group. So only people here are going to get this discount for the next two days. And you can save twenty percent on this course. Because again, people like that exclusivity and I'll have people all the time going, oh my gosh, I've been waiting for a sale.

[00:24:19.090] - Tracie
So you can definitely make those people feel that being there has its benefits and its perks by offering discounts. And don't be afraid to ask your affiliates too, hey, can I get an exclusive offer that I can extend to my group? Your affiliate might say, sure, here's one. If that's the only place you're going to share it, let's go ahead and do it. So that's the way that we're making money directly through our group.

[00:24:42.970] - Liz
I like that.Yeah. And don't be afraid to ask. Like, the worst they're going to do is like, no, they're not going to, like, remove you from their affiliate program.

[00:24:51.070] - Tracie
Right. Yeah, exactly. Exactly. That's why I tell people all the time they're not saying like "no", like they're insulted. They're just saying, no, I can't do that from a business standpoint. So you never know unless you ask.

[00:25:03.690] - Liz
Exactly. Yeah, I feel a lot of bloggers are afraid to, they are just so excited for the opportunity to be an affiliate or the opportunity to like have a contract that they don't ask for things and try to negotiate.So it doesn't hurt to ask now.

[00:25:17.380] - Tracie
Not at all. Not ever.

[00:25:19.410] - Liz
All right. So. What else would you say is important to running a group that's going to foster community so that you are making more and you are growing? And it's one thing I want to touch on. So a closed group is searchable, right? I would assume...

[00:25:34.490] - Tracie
It is still searchable. They will be able to find it. So that's where your "about" is so, so very important. And so when you set up your group within your about, you can use keywords. All right. We all know keywords, guys. We had keywords on Facebook too, hate to break it to you. So can't you escape the magical world of keywords, even when you're trying to do a Facebook group. So we want to use that because that's how people are going to find us.

[00:25:58.310] - Tracie
What's really great, that engagement and we've all been in those groups and you know, how it so suggested groups you might want to join because you were in this other one. The more engaged your group is, the more likely it is to be recommended as another group someone might want to join.

[00:26:17.330] - Liz
OK.

[00:26:17.960] - Tracie
And so it's a it's a missed opportunity if you're not trying to get your group to be engaged, because Facebook's not going to send people to a group that nothing's happening in.

[00:26:27.200] - Tracie
They just aren't they are going to send people to a group or some people are talking. They're going to start recommending it. So we want to make sure that we're engaged just so we can get those, that recommendation to show up to get people to our group without us having to really do anything to really get them there.

[00:26:45.660] - Liz
Got it. So what other, I think that's a great thing to touch on. So what other aspects of Facebook SEO should group owners pay attention to or try to focus on?

[00:26:56.780] - Tracie
All right. So when you create your page, which everybody needs a page, even if you're gonna have a group, because the page is where you advertise, you can't do any advertising through a group, but when you have your page, you can connect your page and your group.

[00:27:11.120] - Tracie
So someone lands on your page, your group will show right on your page. So you've got that free opportunity there to get them. You can also link to it in your email newsletter that you have a group, let people know to come join you. You can put it in blog posts. I know people who those little social icons that we all see and every site like follow me on Pinterest, Facebook and whatnot, they change the Facebook link from their page to their group.

[00:27:38.430] - Tracie
So when they click the Facebook icon, they're instantly dropped into that group where they can join rather than sending them to the page to find the group. So don't think you have to link only Facebook to your page. You can link it there instead. So those are some opportunities. One fun one I like as far as trying to get that growth is find somebody in your niche that maybe work together and promote it to other's groups. You can go into your group like, oh my gosh, you guys, you need to come look at Liz's group.

[00:28:09.320] - Tracie
It's incredible. She's talking all these things.

[00:28:11.840] - Tracie
I'm in there and we're having so much fun. And then Liz would do the same thing. Oh, my goodness, guys, if you're just getting started, you've got to go check out Tracie's group. Here's what she's doing over there. So you're helping each other.

[00:28:22.770] - Tracie
There's this feeling, everyone feels like if I promote somebody else's group, they're all going to leave mine, but they won't. They'll stay in both.

[00:28:29.700] - Liz
No, it takes effort to leave a group. They have to actually do something.

[00:28:33.730] - Tracie
Exactly. Exactly, exactly. So Facebook is smart, like if they start ignoring it, they'll just show it less to them. So, yeah, you don't want that either. Right? But yeah,

[00:28:47.100] - Tracie
But that's what people are. I mean, this people just are inherently lazy is not the word I'm looking for, but that's the best way to describe it, because it does take a lot of effort to leave a group. They'll just add another one and another one and then eventually,  they're like "ugh I'm in too many, I need to clean some up"

[00:29:03.060] - Liz
Yeah, every once in a while but it doesn't happen that often. I don't remember the last time I went through mine. And I I bet you if I went to go look at my list of groups, I'd be shocked. Feel like I have no recollection of that group.

[00:29:14.110] - Tracie
Exactly. Right. Exactly. And so and here's the thing. The other thing you have to realize is it's like our email list when people unsubscribe. Everyone's like "ugh I go unsubscribe" Thats a gift.

[00:29:26.250] - Liz
Right.

[00:29:27.000] - Tracie
That's a gift because they're telling you they're not interested. They're never going to buy. Your group is the same way. If those people are leaving, they were never going to engage with your content. They were never going to be a part of your community. Celebrate those people leaving that those people have told you. You know what? I don't want to clutter your membership or mess up your engagement stats. So I am going to leave right now.

[00:29:51.720] - Liz
Yeah, no. And I think that's one of the things that you'd rather have a smaller, more engaged group, because Facebook is going to recognize that as good than like a gigantic group where like half of percent of the people in it do anything.

[00:30:07.470] - Tracie
Yeah, well, and the thing is, too, sometimes when those groups get really big, they become more difficult to manage because there's so much happening. And I've seen countless groups that had one hundred and two hundred thousand people just get shut down overnight because they just can't control them anymore.

[00:30:20.910] - Tracie
So you don't want that either. So again, numbers are just numbers. You know, numbers don't mean anything I mean,

[00:30:29.130] - Liz
We focus on them a lot as bloggers. And the really only number you want to pay attention to is your bank account.

[00:30:33.600] - Tracie
Exactly it.

[00:30:36.390] - Liz
You don't need one hundred thousand pages to make a full time living with a blog.

[00:30:40.470] - Tracie
Yeah, well, I don't I, I will be honest, you guys, I'm not even getting ten thousand pages a month and I make a full time income, so yeah. You don't have to have a ton of page views to make money running a blog

[00:30:54.480] - Liz
And like a good income to you're not like struggling, you're like a six figure blogger.

[00:30:58.680] - Tracie
Exactly. Yep, yep,

[00:31:00.930] - Liz
Yes. All right. So anything else? Let's kind of try to wrap up anything else people know about Facebook groups, about running one, anything we haven't touched on?

[00:31:11.010] - Tracie
No, I don't think so.

[00:31:12.180] - Tracie
I think we've kind of hit everything that's important. I just tell people to try. You know, we're always as bloggers, we're trying. And I want you to try and you fail, never to try it at all. So try that group. If it doesn't work and it's a colossal failure, OK, chalk it up to experience. Maybe try going a different angle with that group or try to be more niche down with that group and give it another go.

[00:31:36.960] - Tracie
But don't say, "I can't have a group." Don't say, "I shouldn't have a group" and probably don't even say, "I don't want a group." I really think everybody could benefit by running a successful Facebook group.

[00:31:48.450] - Liz
Yeah, it's and the beauty of blogging is it's all editable, right, it could be two years later, like, you know what I think I'm ready to try a group again and you're not starting completely from scratch. You tweak a few things like I can't tell you how many times I've been, "oh, yeah. I made that checklist like three years ago that I could give to people," you know, so it's just kind of keep it in your back pocket if it doesn't work out first time.

[00:32:12.340] - Tracie
Absolutely. Just don't be afraid to try, guys. It just you have nothing to lose but potential dollar signs.

[00:32:19.530] - Liz
Exactly. All right, so, Tracie, thank you so much. I learned a ton. Got all sorts of ideas for the Blogger Breakthrough Summit Facebook group. Now, everyone should make sure they're part of it. Definitely check out Tracie's Facebook group as well. Again, just thank you so much. I love having you as a speaker.

[00:32:34.230] - Tracie
Thanks for having me, it was so much fun.
