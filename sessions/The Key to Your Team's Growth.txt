Hey, everyone. Welcome. I'm so excited you're here. I'm Amy Edge, and today, I'm going to be sharing with you the key to your team's growth and how to unlock your leadership gifts, so you can really lead your team to success.

[00:00:31.410] - Amy
This is going to be applicable to you whether you only have one virtual assistant, a small and mighty team, or maybe even a massive Amy poor field size team. I want to quickly share about my background. So, you know why you should listen to me about your team's growth and development structure. I think myself as the quintessential best friend of change makers.

[00:01:05.390] - Amy
I typically complement those blue sky audacious goals of my visionary counterparts with my detailed approach to business. I blend my skills of project management, team leadership and a get shit done attitude into the equation to help achieve and exceed their business goals. And through this strategic partnership to help businesses increase profit, empower their teams and scale their businesses to create generational wealth that supports and empowers our future entrepreneurs while building their own legacy. I want to make sure you get the most out of the session, so please take a moment and put your phones on a do not disturb mode.

[00:01:51.000] - Amy
Close out those other tabs and get ready to take some notes. Alright, let's go ahead and get started and dive into what I'm going to cover and what you're going to learn today. I'm going to be covering how to shift your focus to creating a healthy culture for your team, vision and clarity for increased team engagement, and how to coach your team to their optimal performance. So, let's get started. So, we're going to start with shifting your focus to creating a healthy team culture.

[00:02:25.660] - Amy
A healthy culture is an ecosystem of healthy relationships. The problem is, we heavily define our culture from the onset in which it then inhibits real culture from flourishing. Real culture is healthy thriving relationships between each person. And our main focus should be on how can we facilitate interaction, healthy relationships, connection and conversation between our team members. Culture is a living, breathing organism. It changes and evolves every day.

[00:03:09.750] - Amy
It's built out of these relationships. And although, we've had to reinvent how we connect, and change, and pivot over the last few years, relationships are not gone from the workplace. They're not gone from the small businesses. They've not been removed from the virtual team.

[00:03:35.830] - Amy
Culture is also not a goal that you're going to try and create. Instead, you're going to blend the relationships that are coming together and transform into this living organism that then turns into the culture of your team. When there is that willingness to connect and to belong, that is really where the relationships and the connections are going to begin to happen naturally and for a community for your team to thrive without you, there must be a willingness and an eagerness for each of the people on your team.

[00:04:16.750] - Amy
Each of the people that you contract or hire want to connect with each other. Vulnerability is the key and the first step in a point of connection between two people. And you as the leader, need to move this forward.

[00:04:45.410] - Amy
This is why it's so important that when you are hiring, you are having multiple interviews in that hiring process. It's how you're really going to identify, is this person going to be a great component for the team that you're building? You're going to begin here by setting the standard and being vulnerable first by sharing your vision for them and then asking them what is the vision that they have for themselves and sharing this will not only show you if they will uphold your core values, and eagerly step into your community, and your team, and your business that you're building, but it's also going to show you, does their vision align with yours?

[00:05:35.420] - Amy
And that is the true key here.

[00:05:38.860] - Amy
We want each team member to come together and row in the same direction. No one person is rowing harder than the other, and we're working together. This really leads into our next point here in regards to vision and clarity, and this is absolutely needed to increase the team engagement that you see within your business. Team engagement is really defined as the degree into which your team, your employees, however your business is created, are motivated by passionate about and invested in the work that they do. This engagement also indicates the individual's commitment to the company that they are working with and their emotional connection to the people that they are working with.

[00:06:35.490] - Amy
So, the first step in this is casting our vision. This is the lifeblood of your team. Work is no longer about metrics. It's no longer about a paycheck. People want to bring about societal change and experience, personal development and growth, and your team is tasked with using their time, their energy and their expertise within your company.

[00:07:08.100] - Amy
That's going to have a positive mission to benefit the world. That is the key to building this cohesive engagement within your company, is having all people on the same page through the vision casting process. So, we need to make our vision statement clear and bold. This helps bring about clarity within the team within the business. This is going to explain how the success of your company is going to change the world. And clarity is built through not only sharing the vision but also through adequate and effective communication. So, communication is, creating these resources while at the same time producing a bonding effect within the team.

[00:08:10.140] - Amy
Clear lines of communication and boundaries have to be drawn and this has to be part of the very first interaction with your company as part of the onboarding process. By increasing these lines of communication among the team members, you're also going to be increasing the lines of responsibility between them as well. So, we can promote healthy communication of your team in multiple ways. So, here's a couple of examples. You could simply add ten minutes to your team meetings just for a check in.

[00:08:47.090] - Amy
This makes team members more comfortable to talk to you as a leader as you're their leader. We love to use this share win with our team when we get ready to start a meeting. So, the wins that we share could be personal. It could be business, but we're creating conversation while allowing everyone to engage, and interact, and become more familiar with the team that maybe we only see and communicate with virtually. Another way you can foster healthy communication is by having brainstorming sessions with your team.

[00:09:28.290] - Amy
This allows people to think creatively without fear, without judgment. And brainstorming fast tracks individual growth and helps get your team straight to the collaboration stage instead of everyone working within a Silo. So, those two things are incredibly important because we need both of those in order to coach our team to optimal performance. You know a great leader is a great coach. A coach in this instance is the facilitator of learning. It is us clearing the path, providing encouragement and helping the individual try and try again until they reach their fullest potential within the team

[00:10:13.710] - Amy
within the company.

[00:10:15.290] - Amy
Coaching essentially believes that each person is an Acorn and that you have your blueprint inside of you rather than being an empty vessel that is waiting to be filled. The coach's here, the leader is here to create the environment that's needed for this optimal growth, this optimal performance in the company. That includes safety, vulnerability, resources, communication, feedback, and also resistance, which is incredibly important. So, when you are coaching your team, when you are leading your team, you have a few goals that you need to ensure that you're reaching, which are awareness, responsibility and objectivity.

[00:11:09.830] - Amy
So, within awareness,

[00:11:11.220] - Amy
your job is to create and cultivate it within the team, so you can only control what you are aware of. What you are aware of, you can then control.

[00:11:29.270] - Amy
How do you become aware of what is happening within the business, right? You're measuring, you're visualizing, you're defining, and you're doing this by asking questions. For instance, if I wasn't here for this problem, what would you do? If you knew the answer, what could that be? Right?

[00:11:53.930] - Amy
We need to coach responsibility. We do this by asking for permission before giving advice. They're going to then listen and not just hear and wait and respond. They're going to ask for accountability and a commitment to and from the team. And there is no true objectivity in the world as us as humans. We're always going to be presented and faced with our own underlying values and prejudices and beliefs and limits and beliefs that we hold personally.

[00:12:33.620] - Amy
So, we need to ensure that when we're talking to our team, we are leading our team. We're never asking them something that we haven't asked ourselves. Right? We're always working towards self awareness, self responsibility, self coaching so that we can really effectively lead our team. Here's the big news flash here.

[00:13:05.870] - Amy
It's never them. It's most likely you, right. As a business owner, your goal every day is to lead an effective team. And our team cannot read our minds yet we often subconsciously expect them to. Right. So, it's important for our team to strive for excellence, but you cannot lead your team.

[00:13:36.700] - Amy
If you are creating a culture of micromanaging. Micromanaging is not the answer. Micromanaging is unsustainable, and building a team around you is going to eventually lead to burnout. You know as difficult as it is to hear, the problem really is not your team. It's you. It's the expectations that you set for your team members.

[00:14:02.990] - Amy
I've seen it way too often where business owners hire to patch up problems, they end up building their team completely around themselves. This is what happens. Like Your team is going to crumble without you. If you build your company and your team structure in this way. When we establish ourselves as the center cog in the wheel, all eyes fall on us, all communication, all resources, all expectations will sit with us. And without you, no one will know what to do or how to do it.

[00:14:49.620] - Amy
And such you begin the cycle of micromanaging just to get things done. Micromanaging does not get an efficient team. Micromanaging your team leads them to constantly relying on you to give them step by step by step detailed instructions.

[00:15:12.730] - Amy
This leads the team members to reaching for the bar you've already set up for them while also having no self responsibility. You become their crutch even though it's not personal or even probably intentional. As an entrepreneur, your leadership is so strong, it's so powerful, but it can cause you to steamroll your team and your company at times. So, instead, I want you to leave today understanding these pieces of how you can truly unlock your team's success and challenge them to make them believe in themselves as much as they believe in you.

[00:16:02.590] - Amy
I'm going to leave you guys today with this amazing quote.

[00:16:07.590] - Amy
I'm not quite sure who said it, but your job as a leader is to give responsibility, not take responsibility. So, I want to ask you what actions are you going to take today? What action are you going to take this week, this month, to shift your focus to creating the healthy culture, to instilling your vision and clarity for increased engagement and to coach your team to optimal performance? I'd love for you to Journal on that and send it over to me if you want feedback, if you want support, if you have questions, my email is here at the bottom.
