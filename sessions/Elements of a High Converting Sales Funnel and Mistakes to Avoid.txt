[00:00:09.520] - Liz Stapleton, Summit Host
All right, guys, I'm really excited for the session with Ryan Turner of Amplifi Strategy. Ryan, thank you so much for being here. I appreciate you taking the time.

[00:00:17.840] - Ryan Turner, amplifistrategy.com
Thank you for the invitation. It's my pleasure.

[00:00:20.870] - Liz
It was great when you pitched your topic on funnel marketing and decided to talk about the mistakes people make with their funnels and whatnot. Can you give anyone who doesn't know you a little bit of information on your background and then we'll dive into all the good stuff?

[00:00:36.800] - Ryan
I'm an American that lives abroad. I'm from Atlanta, born and raised, but live in Madrid, Spain. I've been here since 2005 and love it. I did have a three-year stint in Milan, Italy, from 2006 to 2019, ended up hating it. Moved back to Madrid with my family where I live happily, and it's also where I started my business.

[00:00:53.930] - Ryan
I have a funnel agency. I like to call it a FaaS agency, a funnels as a service agency, and I help course creators, consultants, coaches create marketing funnels to help online businesses or their businesses scale leads and scale their sales quickly.

[00:01:16.070] - Ryan
I do that with full funnel service. I help them with paid advertising. I also help them with educating their leads through nurture funnels or through educational funnel. I also help them with sales funnels. So the full aspect of what funnels is, which is lead generation, education, and then conversion is where I help them. 

[00:01:38.990] - Ryan
I even help them with creating their courses and organizing them to deliver to their clients.

[00:01:46.370] - Liz
Fantastic. I know when I started blogging it was like have a lead magnet. But then there was no information, like, now I have this list that costs me money. And I think I was I'm not alone in that. People just starting still have that issue sometimes.

[00:02:03.380] - Liz
You've kind of covered the basis of a funnel: lead, education, conversion. But you recommend starting with what the conversion experience is going to be like. Is that accurate to say?

[00:02:17.430] - Ryan
Well, it really depends on what your goal is. If I can recommend anything to anybody that's just getting into funnels, it's have a clear goal. Having a funnel is not going to change your business if you don't have a business idea or a business that's functional.  You're going to want to make sure that you have an objective in mind.

[00:02:35.340] - Ryan
Like I mentioned, there's three components of funnel marketing. When we create funnels, we are either generating leads or generating prospects that are going to be open to possibly purchasing from us. That's the first stage of the funnel.

[00:02:53.430] - Ryan
The second stage of the funnel is educating those leads so that they're open and can gain the trust to actually purchase from us. Then the third part of the funnel is that part where they actually say, "Okay, here's my money. Please, change my life."

[00:03:08.220] - Ryan
 When we create a funnel, oftentimes we're using one or two components of those types of funnels, and we'll think of that whole thing as a funnel. But it's really important that you understand what you need.

[00:03:21.600] - Ryan
It makes no sense if you have no leads and no email list or any type of person to sell to, to start to implement some type of strategy called funnel or funnel that's designed to educate leads if you have no leads coming in.

[00:03:36.780] - Ryan
So you're going to want to have a lead generation funnel if you don't already have some type of large list, if you don't have a large following, if you're not an influencer, if you're not huge on Instagram or whatever your platform is of preference. You're going to need a way to actually get leads into your business and convert them.

[00:03:58.670] - Liz
What do you convert them to, though? Because I feel like most of the bloggers have some sort of lead generation or they know they're working on setting it up because, "You need an email list, you need people to sign up," that is shouted from the rooftops all over the place. But then they end up paying for an email marketing list that they don't know how to make money from. So how do they take their lists and funnel them to make money?

[00:04:26.550] - Ryan
Again, ask the important questions. Who are you catering to with your business or with your blog in this case? Who are you catering to?  Why are you even in this Summit? Are you in this Summit because you want to write better or are you in this Summit because you want to actually make a business out of your blog?

[00:04:44.940] - Ryan
Some people are passion bloggers and some people could care less about trying to scale up that. And even though they might tell themselves that they want to make a business out of it, I know some people just aren't in a position to say, "Okay, I'm not going to do this just for passion." You should do something for passion.

[00:05:03.450] - Liz
You should passionate about your business.

[00:05:06.900] - Ryan
Exactly. But that's the thing that you need to understand. If you have made the decision that with this project, with this blog you want to make money, then you need to make a decision that you will make money. That's the part where people start to get wishy-washy, "Well, maybe I will, maybe I won't." Will you or will you not?

[00:05:33.490] - Ryan
It's like Yoda in Star Wars, what he said to Skywalker when he was trying to lift up the space ship out of the swamp. He's like, "Master Yoda, I'm trying." And he said, "Do or do not. There is no try." And that's the same thing. You need to make the decision. It's not that you're not trying or anything. You need to make a decision.

[00:06:01.420] - Ryan
If you've decided that you're going to have a blog that's going to be monetized, then you need to start thinking in terms of a business and not just of passion writing.

[00:06:11.800] - Liz
Sure. Once that decision's been made...

[00:06:14.290] - Ryan
And I forgot your original question, which was how do they...?

[00:06:21.250] - Liz
Take their leads and convert them to make money? How do they figure out what to sell them, whether it's affiliate links or whether it's a product they've created? What do you need to start with? You need to start with a goal in mind and then work backwards.

[00:06:36.010] - Ryan
Well, like I said, the decision is definitely first that you want to make money. If you decide you want to make money, we can just call that, okay, you've got a business idea now. Now, you need to decide, how are you going to help the people that are reading you?

[00:06:56.050] - Ryan
Okay, they're reading your content. Okay, they like what you write. Now, how can you make their life better with something that they could pay you for? Is that a service or is that offering something through your blog that they're willing to pay for that maybe it's not your service, maybe it's some type of product that you can monetize?

[00:07:19.630] - Ryan
You need to understand your readers and understand your audience. If you don't understand them, you need to make the effort to try to understand what they're willing to pay for. A business is comprised of a product or service to sell. And if you don't really have a product or a service in mind, you need to think of one.

[00:07:42.460] - Ryan
It gets convoluted sometimes with certain people that are interested in my services because they think that because they're working with me, I'm going to somehow have some magic pill for them about what their product or service should be. And that's something that is a business owner's prime objective.

[00:08:02.230] - Ryan
I can't really offer much help. You need to be able to at least think of how you can help people. You need to think of an "I help statement", for example, "I help people do this through my blog." That will at least get your mind focused in the right direction.

[00:08:23.530] - Ryan
Copyblogger, I don't know if you've ever heard of them. They're amazing. That's like the perfect example of a blogger that decided he was going to make a living and a business out of his actual blog and they say it, "Words that work for smarter digital marketing and sales." That's what they say when you land on their website.

[00:08:49.550] - Ryan
So they're clear with their messaging and they know how they want to help people. They're helping you with your words for marketing.

[00:08:57.380] - Liz
Right. So before you're diving into setting up your funnel or coming up with your goal, you need to do some market research. And sometimes it's sending a survey to your list if you have a list.  Send them a survey, say, "Hey, what are you struggling with? What would you like to see me do?" You may not get a ton of response, but you'll get something. That'll give you some place to start for sure.

[00:09:21.650] - Ryan
Absolutely. You definitely need to get some type of market feedback. Now, depending on how close you are with your audience, if you're engaging with them, if they engage with you either through Instagram or through the comments section of your blog, or if you have a vlog and they send you blogged responses or video responses. You need to have a feel of that.

[00:09:45.860] - Ryan
You need to know what makes them tick, what makes them respond to you. And if you are able to identify that, you've got a leg up and you are in a very good position to begin to develop something that will resonate. Because if you can't resonate with your audience, then it doesn't really matter what you sell.

[00:10:05.330] - Ryan
In order for someone to sell, it doesn't mean you have to be the best at something. It means they have to trust you. No one's going to buy anything from anybody unless they know that it's going to be a safe purchase. That's how people make purchases. You need to get to that point. And to get to that point, it's recognizing all those things.

[00:10:23.510] - Liz
Yes. So we've talked about having a clear goal, having a clear message that you know where you're going. Before we started recording, you talked about how people get into this marketing cycle of not providing the right content and just focusing on the marketing as opposed to the rest of it. How do people stop that?

[00:10:50.050] - Ryan
Well, I think with regards to bloggers, well, they've got this blog and it's got great content and they're worried about possibly sounding salesy. They don't want to use things like paper click ads on their blog because it ends up being clickbaity.

[00:11:11.290] - Ryan
When you start thinking about money and you start thinking about advertising and start thinking about all these things, lots of negative energy comes into your mind. So the first thing that you should probably think, this is a presentation on funnels, I'm a funnel marketer, is to think of what a funnel is.

[00:11:30.520] - Ryan
I just mentioned Copyblogger because I really like what they do and they're using funnels constantly. But you never feel like you're being pitched at. You feel like they're always offering value.  And what I like to tell people and I usually make this analogy is to think of your customers or your audience coming to you and walking into IKEA. You need to be IKEA; you don't want to be Dollar General.

[00:12:02.190] - Liz
Okay.

[00:12:03.790] - Ryan
Now, both General and IKEA sell a lot of the same stuff. They sell a lot of the same quality stuff from the same places of origin. Probably many of the products that they sell come possibly from the same factories. But what gives you a sense of more satisfaction or fulfillment when you walk into the store? Walking into IKEA or walking into Dollar General?

[00:12:31.030] - Ryan
Most people would say IKEA. IKEA does something, even though they sell lots of the same products besides the furniture. Obviously, Dollar General and dollar stores, they don't sell lots of furniture, but they sell plates and...

[00:12:42.130] - Liz
When you walk into IKEA, you see all the pretty stuff, you see what's possible, and then you start to make your list of ideas and what works. And then it's not till the very end that you can go pick out the stuff to buy.

[00:12:56.160] - Ryan
Exactly. This is exactly it. It's not that you have something to offer, it's that you're showing the benefit of using what it is that you can offer. Like suction cups. You're not going to go to Dollar General and be like, "I need a toothbrush," and then pass a suction cup on some other aisle and be like, "Oh, a suction cup. Let me get that suction cup even though I'm here for a toothbrush."

[00:13:22.920] - Ryan
You don't do that. Yet at IKEA, guess what? You will go to IKEA and be like, "I need the extra credenza for my foyer." And by the time you get the credenza and you get to the checkout, look at your basket. What do you have? You might have some suction cups in there.

[00:13:43.660] - Ryan
You didn't go into IKEA to get some suction cups, but IKEA did something that the dollar store did not. What they did is demonstrate value. They don't just put some suction cups on a rack. You passed a display that had a little toothbrush holder...

[00:13:59.980] - Liz
Get some ways to use it, ideas. Yeah.

[00:14:01.660] - Ryan
Right. Yeah, exactly. They showed you how you can use this and apply this in your home. And then they did something else. They have a call to action. So it's not like they're just showing you how beautiful this suction cup is holding up this little toothbrush holder. They're actually showing you how it applies to your life. And then they say, "Look, if this is something that interests you, we happen to have a giant basket of a thousand of them right here."

[00:14:27.850] - Liz
But you're not going to see them somewhere else in the store.

[00:14:30.280] - Ryan
It's going to be right here, right next to where you saw this really cool message. So they're combining the message, which is, "This can make your life better. Go ahead, you know you want it." And they do this constantly. Then you have to go in one direction.

[00:14:47.920] - Ryan
I'm not saying you should have a blog that makes people not be able to click anywhere, but you should be offering these types of calls to action. If you're talking about a training or if you're talking about something in your blog, maybe there's some type of training or some type of product or some type of service that you could mention right there.

[00:15:04.720] - Liz
A case study or some other...

[00:15:06.950] - Ryan
And if you're interested in finding more information about this one thing I was just talking about, click here. Those are lots of things that bloggers, especially in the beginning, might not necessarily do because they feel like it's a little piece of information that's invading their passion or invading their idea flow.

[00:15:24.550] - Ryan
"I can't put that in there. That's sounds salesy or that sounds like I'm trying to pitch something." And part of that's true, which is why it's important to know that you're in this for the business. You're not in it for the business; you're in it to make a living off of it. You can't live off of passion alone. Passion is not going to pay your bills.

[00:15:43.650] - Liz
Yeah, and part of this Summit, too, is you didn't get into starting a blog to create a lifestyle you wanted to constantly work. You need stuff that works for you and you're not constantly working all hours of the day.

[00:15:59.330] - Liz
I love the IKEA analogy. I've totally had to go back and find the thing in IKEA that I missed somehow, I wrote down where it was, and then describing it and I had to go back. And then the analogy still works, right? Because they're like, "Well, if they miss it, then they're on the lookout for it the next time it comes around."

[00:16:16.020] - Ryan
Right. And even if you did miss it, guess what? When you've finished the check out in IKEA, you got some Swedish meatballs waiting for you. It's like they think of these things. And as sinister as it might sound to some people that this might be new information for them...

[00:16:31.500] - Liz
It needs a mindset shift.

[00:16:33.050] - Ryan
Exactly. It requires a mindset shift because IKEA has thought about these things beforehand.

[00:16:41.600] - Liz
I never thought about IKEA being a funnel, but as soon as you said it I was like, "Oh, yeah."

[00:16:47.420] - Ryan
It's a funnel and you can only go one direction on that long ass mile.  I mean, you have to go like a kilometer and come back.

[00:16:53.860] - Liz
You can use shortcuts if you know what you want, but you still have to [crosstalk 00:16:56]

[00:16:56.330] - Ryan
If you study the map, there are shortcuts, but you've got to go one direction and that's all by design. It's all by design and you need to be conscious of your design. IKEA knows where they want people to go. And if you don't have an idea of where you want people to go or what you want people to buy or what you want to offer people, then you're lost. You need to have the destination before you can create the path. 

[00:17:21.500] - Liz
Yes. Once you've got your path laid out, do you have to pay for ads to get people in your funnel?

[00:17:28.400] - Ryan
No, you do not. Of course, that will depend on who you are. Do you have a large email list? Do you have a large base of followers that are subscribed to your blog? It really depends. What is certain is that you need to have a handle on it. You don't want to have a blog and be like, "I don't know if people read or not. I just do it for the passion, bro. Just throwing it out there."

[00:18:01.310] - Ryan
Okay, but if you want to sell something, then you need to probably have some kind of idea of how much money you probably need to make. If you want to leave your job or if you've already left your job, you know how much money you need to make in order to buy groceries and or do all the stuff that you want to do. And that requires some type of metric.

[00:18:17.520] - Ryan
So before you think about ads or paid advertising, think of what you can do organically. Are there things that you can do organically? But you need to have a path. I mentioned Copyblogger. One of the things that they offer when you land on their website is some type of free training to get better at using copy in a useful way throughout your own marketing efforts. And it's their one call to action when you land on their page.

[00:18:53.910] - Ryan
Now, I'm not saying you have to copy Copyblogger's tactics. But if you have, for example, some type of snitched audience that you know is looking for some type of training or some type of service, offer that somewhere. Because once you know that you can offer it, the mechanics of creating a funnel can help you do that. That's where funnel marketing can help.

[00:19:21.030] - Ryan
We've talked about all this esoteric high level stuff. I know. And people are looking at this and being like, "Will he just get to the funnel? I want to know, how do I connect the opt in page to the thank you page? And how many sequences and how many emails do I need to create?" That stuff all will come, but think about what people want. And if they want training, well, then there are several options that you could do.

[00:19:44.010] - Ryan
You could create a special guide that's going to help your users achieve a specific result. And if you want to offer that guide, well, don't just put the guide up and give it away without being able to track where it goes and who downloads it. Put an opt in page there. Put it behind an opt in page so that they have to opt in in order to get it.

[00:20:04.590] - Ryan
And then once they've opted in to get that, then you can use effective email marketing and use those skills that you learned in the Copyblogger training to actually write something effective to begin to create a relationship with people that are receiving those emails. You'll deliver your free product or the great guide that you've created, and now you're beginning to generate leads.

[00:20:28.020] - Ryan
And now you have a system that you can run ads to. You never want to just run ads to a blog. That would be ridiculous, but you could definitely run ads to a specific guide. You could run ads to a specific guide that guides people and helps people and has an opt in. You can retarget, you can do a whole bunch of things that way. But you can start off with doing it organically before you go to...

[00:20:56.490] - Liz
And you can do it without feeling salesy, which is something we already discussed. I do want to mention; we have copywriting and email marketing sessions with this Summit that are fantastic. So just keep it in there. Copyblogger is also great, but just throwing that out there.

[00:21:13.590] - Ryan
I want [inaudible 00:21:14]

[00:21:14.550] - Liz
Okay. I think that takes us to a good place because we are running out of time, where I think you have a guide for everyone attending. Do you want to tell them about it?

[00:21:29.290] - Ryan
Yes. Everyone that's watching this obviously is an attendee, and I'd like to offer this free guide, which is a funnel marketing guide: the five steps that will help you create a funnel. It's got some really actionable items in there. It's short, easily consumed. I think it's like 25, 30 pages and it's available to everyone that's participated in the event. There will be a link somewhere for people to get access to that.

[00:22:05.630] - Liz
Okay. Then you also have something for our pro-pass holders.

[00:22:10.210] - Ryan
Yes. For pro-pass holders, I've got an actual funnel template that will include pages, it will include email sequences, and it will include check out, everything automated. If you're already a member of Kartra, it's actually based on the Kartra system. If you don't have Kartra, you'll still get access to all of these great mock ups.

[00:22:32.750] - Ryan
So you can actually try to model this template in your own system if you're using something like ClickFunnels or WordPress or whatever system you might have. But if you are a Kartra user, you get them imported directly into your account.

[00:22:46.310] - Ryan
I charge like 300 bucks for these usually. So it's a great deal and everything is put together if you're in Kartra. I mean, literally all the sequences. It's a lead magnet funnel. So if you've got something like a guide like what I'm offering and you want a way to effectively deliver that guide to your audience, it's a great way to do that.

[00:23:08.180] - Liz
Okay. So guys, definitely check that out. Definitely, go grab the free guide. You can see he really knows his stuff.

[00:23:13.370] - Ryan
But you got to be a pro-pass member to get that one.

[00:23:15.380] - Liz
Yeah, the pro-pass, you can tell it's definitely worth it. And if you guys have questions, feel free to let me know. I know Ryan's in the chat probably for a couple more minutes. So ask him ask him some questions before he has to go.

[00:23:28.010] - Liz
Ryan, thank you so much. I appreciate you walking us through where people get tripped up with funnels and how they can do better. Thank you.

[00:23:35.810] - Ryan
I appreciate the invitation. I appreciate everyone's time that's joining us and best of luck to your funnels. If you need any help or resources, don't hesitate to reach out. I'm in the chat and I'm here to help.
