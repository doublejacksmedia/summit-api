Liz Stapleton [00:00:00]:
Alright, guys. Super excited for the session with Christina from meyne.co. First of all, Christina, thank you so much for being here. I really appreciate it. Thank you

Christina Orleans [00:00:06]:
for having me. I'm so excited.

Liz Stapleton [00:00:08]:
Yeah. Yeah. Because you're gonna be talking home pages, which and I I I've been guilty of this in the past of just having, like, my latest content, like, a blog roll up on my home page, and it's really not the most effective way to use it. Mhmm. So can you give us a little bit about your background and what we're gonna learn today?

Christina Orleans [00:00:25]:
Yeah. Well, my background is I started out as a blogger myself back in 2011. And so from there, I had a real passion to make blogs strategic but I was only working on my own. And so I moved on to helping other bloggers and I I create strategic design. That's what I do now and I've been doing that for 5 years. So I have a lot of experience and I've seen a lot of what works and what doesn't. And for the homepages, it's really crucial. Visitors have a specific goal when they visit your home page and most of us don't think about that.

Christina Orleans [00:01:02]:
Just like you said, we just put our latest post up or we just put up something that looks good. But they have a goal, and so that's what we're gonna get through is getting to their goal and your goals and turning that into a strategic design.

Liz Stapleton [00:01:16]:
Okay. I'm excited for that because I'm sure I just redid my home page, recently, and I I think it's a lot better than it was, but I'm sure there's tons of room for improvement. So I'm excited to, see what you have to say, and, let's go ahead and get to it.

Christina Orleans [00:01:32]:
Alright.

Christina Orleans [00:01:32]:
Alright. So as we just mentioned, we're going to be talking about how to create an effective homepage for your blog when they get to your results. So an effective homepage can really make a difference for your blog. It can get your readers to see you as a go to resource. It can build authority and trust in their minds towards you. It can increase your page views, which is the goal of most bloggers or a goal of most Bloggers. And it can do that in a much more meaningful way as well than just getting somebody to click on a related post within a blog post. We'll talk about why a little bit later.

Christina Orleans [00:02:14]:
And it can also increase your subscribers and pretty dramatically too because of all of the above and because we can do it in a much more effective and direct way. So we're gonna talk about how to do all those things. First, I want to talk about how different blogging is today than it was a while back back when the standard was set to just show your latest posts on your home page. Just as Liz mentioned just now, it's actually still pretty common to see blogs just showing their most recent posts on their home page. This is a practice that started when blogging was completely different, and it was effective for the way people used blogs back then. People used blogs. This is an example here back from 2008, you can see, and this is a fancy blog too. It had just the sidebar, and then it just showed the the first bit of each of the most recent posts.

Christina Orleans [00:03:21]:
So it was effective back then because blogs, social media did not exist as it does today. You know, even Instagram and Twitter did not exist at this point. And so blogs were used back then to follow along with personalities and people and projects that you really liked watching. Now we have social media for that. We don't use blogs for the same way anymore. Social media is much more efficient and much more effective with things like that. Just following along with a project or a person, it's way easier to do it on Instagram than it is by subscribing to a blog. Right? So that's one reason one big difference that between blogs today and blogs back then.

Christina Orleans [00:04:10]:
So you can see if that's why we used blogs, and it was most helpful to show the recent the most recent posts first. It made sense. That's how people use them. That's what they wanted out of their blog. Today, people don't have the time or attention spans because, again, back then, social media was not what it is today. And, also, blogs got their start before smartphones existed, and so people had longer attention spans. They had more patience for, because of the the lack of all the new technology we have, and they were willing to just go to a blog home page and spend some time scrolling through, maybe even rereading some old posts. But people don't have time for that anymore.

Christina Orleans [00:04:56]:
When people go to a site, they're going there for a specific purpose. They wanna get one thing out of it. So we need to we need to rethink the home page showing the latest post because it's not, it's not what your readers are hoping to see. Showing the latest post is just not gonna solve their problems, and we don't they don't have the patience for us anymore to sit and scroll through, to search. We need to make it easy for them. So those are some of the big differences between then and now and why it's really important to to create a strategic homepage. So before we get started, there's a couple of things that we need to be really clear on. 1st is both your goals for your blog and your readers' goals for your blog.

Christina Orleans [00:05:45]:
They have goals when they're visiting you just like you have goals when you are, when you're blogging in general. So it's really important that we don't go about your whole blog or your home page with just your goals or just your rear year's goals in mind. We really need to marry the 2 and and serve both of them. If you only focus on your goals when you're blogging and when you are designing your and creating your new home page, that self-service is really going to come through. Even if it's subconscious to people, it's gonna feel a little bit do what I want. It's gonna feel a little bit pushy. It's going to feel like, they might be overwhelmed with ads. It's going to just the self-service is going to come through, again, even if it's subconscious, but it's not gonna make a connection with people.

Christina Orleans [00:06:42]:
And we need to marry that with the goals of your visitors because if you didn't focus on your own goals, if you didn't have your goals in the mix here and you were only trying to accomplish the goals of your visitors, then you would have a giant subscriber base. You would have tons of people that trusted you, that saw you as the go to resource, that just came back all the time, recommended you to everybody, did all the marketing for you. But then you would not be accomplishing your own goals with the blog. You wouldn't be making any money. You wouldn't be, you wouldn't be achieving the things that you want to achieve with your blog. So it's really important to marry your goals with the goals of your visitors. And you're going to see once you start listing them down, which I'm gonna walk you through a little bit in a second. But once you once you start getting clear on your goals and their goals, you're gonna see a really cool thing is that they are intertwined, and they overlap.

Christina Orleans [00:07:42]:
When you have something that you need to share with them with people that that you really know and can really help people, well, that's why they're coming to you. They wanna know. They wanna learn. And so there's really a huge overlap, and sometimes we can we can kind of separate them too much and just see what I want, what they want, but they really are the same thing. Okay. So it's super important to get clear on your goals and their goals first and then understand how to intertwine them and serve both at the same time. The other thing that you need to do before we get started is to check your stats. So I'm gonna tell you how to do that very briefly here, but, again, the instructions are in the workbook if you want it.

Christina Orleans [00:08:30]:
In your Google Analytics, click on the behavior option, and then from there, click on behavior flow. You'll see a really cool chart if you haven't looked at this before. It's super helpful and very good to know, but you will see a little box with your home page in it. It'll just show the backslash instead of the the, the URL of a blog post. It'll just show your show your backslash. So if you hover over that little box that's showing that's representing your home page, you will be able to see how many people come come to your home page and you'll be able to see how many people leave your blog after visiting your home page. If you're showing your latest posts, that percentage is gonna be really high. People are often just going to leave from your home page.

Christina Orleans [00:09:22]:
You do not want that to happen. You do not wanna miss the opportunity to get people to convert from your home page. No matter what that conversion is for you, you don't want them just leaving your blog from your home page. That's a sign that your home page needs work. Even and and it can be pretty high too. Even if you're not just showing your latest posts, if you have something a little bit more strategic and, then it it could still be a pretty high bounce rate. So what we're going to do is try to be strategic about it and get that lower either way. So what I want you to write down is is the today's date and how many people are visiting your home page and then the percentage of people that are leaving your home page after or leaving your blog after visiting your home page.

Christina Orleans [00:10:12]:
So we're gonna try to get that lower. So that's the stat that I want you to keep an eye on, maybe monthly, and just make sure especially after you do all this work. But just keep checking back because you can always tweak, and we always want that number to go down. That percentage that's leaving your blog, we always want it to go down. So I want you to keep track of that stat. Just just check-in on it once in a while, especially after you make changes and see how effective they are, and then you can play around and find what works for you and your audience. Okay. So now it's time to list those goals that we talked about.

Christina Orleans [00:10:52]:
And we're not just gonna list those goals. We're going to find ways to achieve those goals on your home page. We're gonna figure out what will what will support that goal. So this you probably have a big overall goal for your blog. I hope so. You should. So if you have your your overall goal, then you probably have smaller goals to help you reach that goal. So only you know what your specific goals are for your blog, and you're probably getting a lot you're going to get a lot out of this whole summit about, what goals you should set, new things you should be doing.

Christina Orleans [00:11:32]:
So keep that in mind as we're going through this. So some examples here. One of your goals to support your overall goal for your blog is probably to increase subscribers. That's a really important goal for all of us to have, whether we're bloggers or business owners or both. Growing our subscribers is huge. So how can you do that on your blog practically? This is just we don't wanna overthink it, but, practically, we do that by encouraging newsletter sign ups. Right? So that's one thing that you will want to focus on on your home page. Again, when people visit your blog for the first time, they almost always come to a blog post and not your home page.

Christina Orleans [00:12:22]:
So you've already solved a problem on your blog post. You don't need to worry about solving a specific problem again on your homepage. You need this is this is the time when we need to think about our overall goals and their overall goals and get them combined like we've said. So one of your overall goals is probably to grow your newsletter. And so on your home page, we're going to need to encourage newsletter sign ups. Another thing you might have as a goal for your blog is making money directly. And for that, we might need to drive traffic to your shop or your resources page or your work with me page or maybe an affiliate page. However you're making money on your blog or however you want to make money on your blog.

Christina Orleans [00:13:11]:
If this is a goal to make it directly, then we're going to want to add something that will help funnel visitors to drive them to those pages where they can support you, and you can help them by providing them products or services. Another thing that might be a goal is increasing page views, and this is always helpful no matter what. Again, these are the basic goals that you probably have, and how we can do that is to make your homepage really sticky, to really encourage people to not just not see to to not just skip through and say, well, I guess this blog doesn't have anything else for me. We want them to visit your home page and think that they could just stay there forever. Like, they could visit it every day and keep learning from you. So we really wanna make it sticky. And in and in support of that, we wanna decrease the ways that people can click away from it. And a big one here is social media.

Christina Orleans [00:14:15]:
So we don't generally want to really promote our social media channels too much on our blogs. We, of course, want people to come over and follow us there as a way to support our blog, another marketing avenue for us. But think about what happens when when people visit and then they see your link to Instagram and then they click on that link, but then they're just in Instagram and they've forgotten all about you and they have followed a bunch of other people. That's not what we wanna happen. We wanna serve their needs first. So decrease the ways that encourage people to click away from your blog and forget about you. We can always move those down to the bottom. That's a little trick, because usually when somebody finally gets to the bottom of a blog, then they have pretty much learned what they need to learn, and then it's a great time for them.

Christina Orleans [00:15:08]:
They're ready to ease out of your blog or your website, and so it's a great time for to lead them over to a social channel where they can hopefully follow and then get distracted by the rest of the social media. So after that, after you have your goals listed and you've brainstormed along with each one ways that you can encourage your visitors to help you achieve those goals, then in another column or on another page, we wanna list their goals, what they're coming to us for. So as I mentioned earlier, people visit blogs so that they can have a problem solved. So what you wanna do you're already solving their problems with your blog post, hopefully. So what you wanna do is you wanna make the solutions easy for them. You wanna make finding the solutions easy for them. So I'm gonna give you an example here. Say you were on Pinterest, and you were looking for a way to style your coffee table.

Christina Orleans [00:16:12]:
Well, you found this great post, and you you found this great pin, and you followed it through. You read the post. You loved what she had to say. You were really excited, and you were like, well, she has great style. She has she's great at teaching me how to do this myself. I need to see if she has more posts that are gonna help me. Maybe she can tell me also how to build a really cool gallery wall in my living room. Whatever whatever you might be looking to decorate, she is probably gonna be able to help you since she did such an awesome job with that post.

Christina Orleans [00:16:44]:
So, naturally, you're probably going to click over to our home page and see what she has what else she has to offer. But if she's got her latest post listed instead of something like categories, then you might just see, you know, something like how to pick a diaper bag. But you don't have kids necessarily. So maybe that post doesn't help you. The next one might be, you know, how to decorate a nursery. Again, not that helpful to you if you don't have kids. The next post after that maybe it's how to cook a really good post workout meal. If you don't work out, it's not gonna be very helpful for you.

Christina Orleans [00:17:26]:
You're not gonna have the patience to sit there and scroll through and search her blog and see if she has any more decor advice for you. You're just gonna leave. You'll probably save the pin so you can reference it later, but you're not gonna subscribe because you think, just naturally that she probably does not address your problems. That was probably just a one off post, and so there's no reason for you to subscribe and follow along with her. So in that case, this is this is why it's really important to show strategic categories on your blog post. So if she had had if you went over to her home page and she just had, she showed her categories and maybe the most recent 3 or 4 posts from each of her key categories, you probably would have seen an entire home decor category. And you could have clicked through to see them all, and you would have just gotten lost in her blog. So that is one way to do that, show categories on your home page.

Christina Orleans [00:18:32]:
Okay. Another way to solve her problems is to share really good freebies. Again, the key here is solving problems. They come to your blog because they have a problem to solve. So make sure that you have some really good freebies to give them that will really address a problem they have and solve it. So once you have those freebies, it's really good. It will actually accomplish both her goals and your goals. You can see here how they're marrying together because you'll get a subscriber, and she will get a solution to our problem.

Christina Orleans [00:19:08]:
And she won't be mad if you're solving her problem. She won't be mad at all about giving you her email address. She'll be happy about it. So that is the that's that's an awesome thing to be able to do. Combine your goals with their goals. So if you have good freebies, do not be shy about them. Don't necessarily be pushy about them, but just show her that they're there. Make it easy for her to sign up.

Christina Orleans [00:19:31]:
Okay. So once you have listed all of her goals or their goals, then you're going to want to build trust. You're going to want to find ways that you can build trust on your home page. So we've talked about all the elements that we can have that support your goals, that can support their goals, and now we need to add some ways that will build trust with your readers. So they've already taken it to the next level by clicking through from one of your blog posts to your home page like we talked about. So now we need to show them that they can trust you and that they've made a good decision. So the first thing is especially, this is this can be just a tiny introduction, but you want to give them a little introduction to your blog. You wanna just make a little connection with them and tell them what you blog about.

Christina Orleans [00:20:25]:
We wanna make things easy for them. We want to show them immediately that they're in the right place. So you're going to want to tell your visitors what this blog is about, what kind of problems you solve for them. And you along those lines, you're also going to want to introduce yourself because people trust somebody that they can see way more than they they trust somebody they can't see, that doesn't show themselves, that doesn't tell them who they are. So have a quick introduction of yourself. But, again, when you're doing this, remember that it's to in their minds, it's all about them. So they don't wanna see somebody just going on with all kinds of I statements, but they do wanna see your face. They wanna see you smiling.

Christina Orleans [00:21:11]:
They wanna see that you're a real person, and they wanna make that connection with you. But then they wanna know how you can help them, why you are unique, why they should follow you, and and how you're going to solve their problems. So have a little introduction to yourself, but remember, make it it make it a reader focused introduction to yourself. And don't forget the picture. Please have a picture of yourself on your home page. So another way we can build trust with our visitors is to show to show social proof. So, again, we don't wanna distract them too much with social media, especially on your home page, because we don't want them to just leave and forget about you. So what are some ways that you can do this? You when you can show if you get a lot of comments on your blog posts, then you can show the number of comments on each of your blog posts.

Christina Orleans [00:22:07]:
If you show the snippets of your blog post, so the first few lines of your blog post on your home page, then you can show, underneath the title or wherever it is, wherever it shows up in your theme, you can show how many comments, that blog post gets. And do and that's a good idea. If you get a lot of comment, then it's a good idea to show that on your home page because people like things that are popular. People want to be places where lots of other people are. If something's popular, a lot of other people are going to want to join in. That's just how social proof works. So number of comments. If you get a lot of comments, it's a good idea to show how many comments your blog post have on your home page.

Christina Orleans [00:22:53]:
Maybe you get a lot of social shares instead of comments or both. You can have both too. If you get a lot of social shares, it's a good idea to show underneath each post how many social shares you get. In some themes, you have to work a little bit harder for this, or you have to hire somebody even. But if you can show how many social shares you have for each post on your home page, it's gonna do a lot as to to show some social proof and build trust in people. And, again, social media, if you have a lot of followers, then it is a good idea to show people that. But, again, do it at the bottom if you can so you're not distracting people until they're finished reading. So the last thing.

Christina Orleans [00:23:39]:
You've listed all the ways to achieve your goals, to achieve their goals, and now you need to list the ways that you wanna build trust on your home page. All of these are gonna come together, and they're gonna be the actual elements that we put on your new strategic home page. So it might seem like a lot of tedious work right now, but it's all gonna come together quickly. So the next step is once you have all of the elements that you want, the next step is to look for some inspiration. So, of course, there's Pinterest. You can look around for blog design ideas that you like for homepage design ideas that you like. But just keep in mind, you're not looking for an exact design necessarily at this point. You're you're mainly looking for a layout and ways that you can arrange the information, ways they all those those things that's elements that you've listed off that you want there.

Christina Orleans [00:24:38]:
We're looking at ideas for how to arrange that information in a good looking way and in a helpful way. So pay attention to what other bloggers are doing and what order things are in and and think about what goals they might be achieving with having things laid out the way they are laid out. So just be really observant. So you can use Pinterest for this, like I said, but it's also a really good idea to just search look at popular blogs and not just in your niche either. I know I've I've noticed over the years as a blog designer and developer that most niches tend to stick inside themselves, stick with each other, and not even look at blogs outside their niche. But you can learn so much by crossing over to another niche. Since since the niches have kind of separated themselves and gone down different paths, you'd be really surprised at how there's different design trends. There's different layout trends.

Christina Orleans [00:25:42]:
They've just they've just, like, gone to completely different directions, and and they both have both not both. There's tons of niches. All the niches tend to have some really cool ideas that you could borrow, that they could all cross and mix together. But because they kind of stick among themselves, they don't notice that that's a cool and very potentially very helpful thing that other bloggers are doing. So if you're a food blogger, don't just look at other food blogs. That's just it's kind of a sure way to make sure that you blend right in according as far as your visitors know. Go over and look at home decor blogs and go over and look at mommy blogs or lifestyle blogs or any kind of blogs that you can think of. Just look outside your niche and look at how they're laying things out.

Christina Orleans [00:26:34]:
Look for really cool ideas that you might wanna utilize. And remember to just be to really analyze what you're looking at and and look at how things are laid out, what you might be able to use in your own blog, and then write down all these ideas, Save them in Pinterest. However you can however you can keep them together, whatever's work works best for you, just do that. So keep your ideas together. Once you have all that, you're gonna go on to the next step, which is actually sketching out a possible layout for your blog. We don't wanna get, stuck on technology at this point. We really wanna make sure that we are doing things in a strategic order for a purpose. We don't wanna get stuck with what technology can or can't do at this point.

Christina Orleans [00:27:25]:
All we wanna do is we wanna make sure that we're achieving goals here. So what you wanna do is you want to physically sketch it out with paper and pencil. It's gonna look awful unless you're a really good artist, then it might be cool. It's gonna look awful, but it really should just be this simple as you see here, just boxes. And maybe just put lines where you're gonna have text just like you see here. You can shade something in with a pencil a little bit if you need to show some color differences, but the point here is to just get those boxes out to put things where you wanna put them. And and it's a good idea to do this 2 or 3 times or even more if you need to to just look at all the possibilities, to think about how you might want it to be laid out. And don't forget to label.

Christina Orleans [00:28:16]:
I didn't put any labels in this example here, but, like, that top box might be a newsletter sign up. It might be, an ad kind of for your freebie. And then underneath that might be your about page or your shop page, whatever those goals are, whatever you need to drive people to, whatever you need to share with people. And then and then you can see at the bottom, maybe those are ways that your categories could be laid out, your key strategic categories, don't forget. So, again, some of the things that might be included here, as I said, newsletter sign up, links to shop and resources pages, your strategic categories, and the most recent posts from each one, Good freebies, and then don't forget your introductions. Okay. So, again, once you're doing this also, remember or you might not know, I'm gonna give you a couple design tips. They're not really they're they're not really design tips.

Christina Orleans [00:29:14]:
They're actually foundational in design information. So I don't want you to go too crazy with this. They're just things to keep in mind when you're analyzing other blogs and when you're thinking about how to lay out your blog. And the first one is that attention span is earned, and it's just a a proven fact that when people visit a website, if there's a lot of text at the top, they're not going to read it. They they have a very short attention span. You really need to prove yourself to them very fast, or they're just gonna skip through. So attention span is earned. Start with very small amounts of text at the top and make it really readable.

Christina Orleans [00:29:54]:
You know, use a header so that the first font is really big. And then for the next sentence, just keep it a sentence or 2. Use a paragraph font or just a regular font. Just make it really easy to scan. And then as you get farther down the page, your text can get longer and more in-depth. But at the top, keep it as simple as possible. Don't just jump in with a big blocks of text. They will not read it.

Christina Orleans [00:30:21]:
It's just the way we are. So the other thing to keep in mind is using hierarchy. So, again, I don't expect you to go and become a design expert, but this is an important point. And it's why things, like, as you see in the little sketch up on the side, it's it's why things are different colors. It's it really is a matter of guiding people through your content. And I have an example here. Oh, my text is overlapping a little bit. Sorry about that.

Christina Orleans [00:30:52]:
But you'll look at this first. Right? Isn't that the first thing you saw on this page? And then the you can see how the other, the size and the placing and the color and the the fonts, they they lead you around the page to read one thing and then another thing and then another thing. And so it's important to keep that in mind because a lot of people when they're DIY ing their blog designs, they will not use different fonts, different colors, and we don't wanna go crazy with these two things. We want to keep it on brand and simple. But this is a good example. It's really just 3 different colors and just the same font, just different sizes and different weights and and different colors. And so you really wanna keep in mind just not to keep things flat and all the same. You want to guide people.

Christina Orleans [00:31:47]:
So when something's really important, don't be afraid to put emphasis on it. When you really want somebody to see the benefit of signing up for your newsletter, don't be afraid to put emphasis on it. You wanna lead them to what's most important. So go ahead and use, one of your your brand colors behind your newsletter sign up form. Use all caps if that matches your brand fonts or use, use one of your headings. Just just keep it in mind. Again, I don't expect you to be an expert at this or to really go in-depth with this concept. But if you when you're looking around at those other blogs getting inspiration, this is another thing that you can keep an eye on.

Christina Orleans [00:32:29]:
Just watch how different backgrounds and different font sizes and different font weights, whether it's bold or normal, they really guide your eye around the page. So that's just something to keep in mind. Don't make everything the same color and the same font size. Give some interest and give and guide people to what's most important. Okay. So now that we have all of that taken care of, it is time to actually build your home page. So you should have all the elements written down. You've sketched out layouts that you can have, and and I wanna show you that it is totally doable to build this yourself in WordPress.

Christina Orleans [00:33:12]:
So I'm actually going to walk you through how to do that now. So here we are in a WordPress blog, an example of a WordPress blog. So I can show you that this is totally doable for you. There's nothing you need to be worried about. You're gonna do an awesome job building your home page. So let's get started here. First, there is a plugin that I think would be very helpful for you, and I'm going to show you some of the key elements using this plugin. It's a high quality plugin.

Christina Orleans [00:33:47]:
It's not gonna slow down your site. It is up to date. It's made by great people. So no worries with this plugin, and it's called atomic blocks. So what you wanna do is you wanna go to your plugins, and you want to click add new. I'm not going to do it now because I already have it done, but you likely know how to install and find and install a plug in anyway. So it's called atomic blocks. Again it'll be in the workbook too if you want to download that.

Christina Orleans [00:34:15]:
And just install that plugin and make sure to you should be using the new WordPress editor by now called Gutenberg. It's nothing to be afraid of. It takes a little bit to get used to, but then you won't be able to imagine going back once you make the switch if you haven't yet. So make sure you're on a new WordPress, and you have atomic blocks plugin installed. And we will get started here. So you're going to start with creating a new page to use as your home page. So you can do that, of course, by going up to new and then clicking page or going over here to page and clicking add new. You can name it home page or you can name it whatever you would like.

Christina Orleans [00:35:02]:
It it's up to you. But as long as you can keep it straight, you're not going to be publishing this page right away. So you can screw up all you want with nothing to worry about. You're not going to break anything, and nobody's going to see your work until you're ready. So title your page, and then we're gonna start adding blocks. So the first one, let's just say that you wanted your we're gonna we're gonna go back to your sketch now, so make sure you have your winning sketch that you made with you. Say you wanted to start with your newsletter sign up. Maybe you wanted an image in the background and then a, a call to action, some text, and then a button.

Christina Orleans [00:35:42]:
If you're maybe your freebie is on another page on your blog and you want them to go there. If that's the case, then there's a really cool block that we can add from atomic blocks, and it's called the CTA. So you can see atomic blocks is gonna make things super easy for us. So just click the plus button to add a new block. And then to see all they have to offer, you can scroll down to atomic blocks, and then there's the a b call to action that I mentioned. All of their blocks start with a b because it stands for atomic blocks. So if you ever wanna search, just type in a b as well. Okay.

Christina Orleans [00:36:20]:
So here is the basic call to action. A little bit boring now. Right? But, let's not worry about that quite yet. Let's add a call to action title. I'm just making this up as I go along. I had not thought this part out. You'll wanna do something better than this, obviously. Okay.

Christina Orleans [00:36:48]:
So this is gonna be great. As I said, if this is a button, and you can add the link to your page if you wanted people to go to another page to sign up. So then you can see how customizable this is. Let's add a background image. So all you'll need to do is go over here on the right, and you'll see all the really cool options. So under background options, you can select an image. Let's just go in and pick 1. Let's do this one.

Christina Orleans [00:37:20]:
Alright. So there we have a background image. Maybe that's a little bit too dark to see your text on. So another cool thing you can do is change the opacity. So you can just slide that up and down till it looks good. Maybe you wanted to change the button. Let's say click here in all caps, and the blue is not your really your color, so we'll go down to blue, button options. You can play with the size here.

Christina Orleans [00:37:46]:
You can also make it square, and you can change the button color. Let's just click a custom color and how about that? Okay. You can change the color text here as you see. You can open in a new tab, but probably you don't wanna do that unless you're taking people off your blog, which you also might not wanna do. But here we go. There's the basic options. And let's say you just want this the full width of the screen. You can see here, right here in the editor, that it's only going to be as wide as your your, your page width on your blog, but maybe you want it to go all the way to the edges of the screen.

Christina Orleans [00:38:26]:
I did not wanna save that, the Pinterest button. Let's just click on it again. And here, you can select full width. And look at that. It'll go the full width of the page. A lot of sign up options are like that as you probably know. That's how easy it is to do with a plugin like this. So maybe you don't just want the the button to to take people to another page.

Christina Orleans [00:38:51]:
Maybe you want an actual sign up form there. You can do that too. So another way to do that is to add another block. Let's just say there's a lot of ways so we can do it. In Gutenberg, there are so many block options, but let's just use cover because it's a nice and simple one. So you can use a background image just like above. So let's do the same one. Select that, and then you can see this automatically makes it darker and then has lighter text.

Christina Orleans [00:39:23]:
So let's say let's just do something super simple. You can put your text in. You can play with it just like you can writing a blog post. Let's put that in the center. And then say you wanted to add your the code for your newsletter sign up form, right, for MailerLite or Mailchimp, or Convertkit, whoever you're using, you can do that. Just while let's add another block here. Click on the plus button, and then you can search for, in the search box, HTML. You put that in, and then you can just paste your the code for your actual sign up form.

Christina Orleans [00:40:11]:
It will just go right here. Let me just do that so we can see it. And then, again, same way, you can make this full width, and it will go over the whole thing. You can also just so you know, you can, you can change the overlay color and the opacity for it as well just like the other one. So if we didn't want it if you didn't want this to be darker, you want it to be lighter, you could just change the overlay to white and then and then adjust the opacity as needed. Okay. So that's how easy it is. 2 different ways to add sign ups in Gutenberg.

Christina Orleans [00:40:50]:
The next thing that I wanna show you how to do is a really cool way to make a good looking about section. So there's a a trend right now in web design where there's a big picture on one side and then the text on the other. So I'm gonna show you the easiest way to do that. We're gonna add another block, and that is called the media block. And you'll see it here. You can see a little little graphic of a box and then some text. So let's go ahead, and I wanna move the picture to the the right side. So I'm just gonna click that button.

Christina Orleans [00:41:22]:
We'll go to media library and pick another image to use. Let's say this one. Looks good. Okay. And then right here where it says content, you can just write. And, of course, write something way better than that, please. But in just an introduction to what the blog is about. Okay.

Christina Orleans [00:41:51]:
You're gonna need more text than that, and and it's gonna need to be better than that. But that's this is how, to do to add a feature like this. You can also adjust the size. Super easy. So many options with this new editor. And this is also not part of Atomic Blocks. This is built into WordPress, so you can use this with any theme. Okay.

Christina Orleans [00:42:14]:
So there we go. That is how to add that, and you can do the same for the about you section. Maybe switch sides and put the image down down lower when you do the add this block again. Switch sides, put the put image of you on the other side and then the text on the other side, and then it it's look. It looks great. It looks continuous, consistent. Alright. So let me show you a quick way to add the categories.

Christina Orleans [00:42:40]:
You can add the most recent posts from each category. So what you wanna do first is add a title for your category. So we are going to add a block, and let's do a heading. So this is your most important category, the one you wanna drive people to, the one that people want to see from you. If I can stop talking, I'll be able to spell category. So this is a heading. You can center it if you'd like. And then click the plus button again.

Christina Orleans [00:43:14]:
We're going to use a very cool block from atomic blocks. So scroll down to theirs, and then you will see here somewhere, ah, the first one, a b posts and page grid. Click on that, and it's going to automatically grab your most recent posts in all of the categories. Again, as we've been talking about, we're gonna be way more strategic than that. So when you click inside this block, you will see all kinds of options here on the right. That's gonna probably stay post for content type. I'm not gonna go through all the options, but the key one right here is category. It's showing all categories.

Christina Orleans [00:43:56]:
Let's just say we want to show this most important category. So just click on that, and it's only going to show posts from that category. So you can change the number of items that you show just by sliding this or typing it in. Whatever you wanna do, you can change the number of columns to 3 or 4. Obviously, do what looks best for your blog. You can even do 1 column. We're gonna put let's put it at 3, and let's say 6. So as you can see, this is not looking so great as is.

Christina Orleans [00:44:31]:
So we're gonna make some adjustments here really quick. We're gonna go down to post and page grid content. It's grabbing a full size image, so it's going to be let's let's do squares instead. So select the square. We don't need to put the author. We do want the title to show. We probably don't want the date to show. So here we have the title of the post, the featured image, and then we have an excerpt.

Christina Orleans [00:44:59]:
That's a really long excerpt for what we're using. So we're just gonna grab this and slide it down until it looks good. And that's pretty good. Right? You can also remove it altogether if you don't want it. It's a good idea to have a little bit, though, if it fits with your theme and your style. You can change the text if you want, and look at this. So then when you have more categories to add, just add more. You could also change it up.

Christina Orleans [00:45:25]:
If you have one category that's more important, you can have it show just 1 post wide, one one column instead of 3 columns like this. So the op the the options are really endless here, and it's done in such a simple way. Let's go ahead and preview this to see what it looks like. Again, you saw that this took about 5 minutes to make. Oops. And we still have our sidebar. So here's a good thing. Let's get rid of that sidebar.

Christina Orleans [00:45:52]:
Now this is gonna be different for depending on what theme you have, but if you're using a Genesis theme, the quick and easy way is to click on this g for Genesis up in the corner, click default layout, and say full width con content, and then and then that'll take that away. I'm not gonna do that right now because I wanna wrap this up, but you can see how cool. Just imagine it being full width, and then and then you'll see how easy it is. Look. There's your categories, and it's still showing the the long I didn't save it since since shortening the excerpts. But you get an idea how easy it is and all the cool things that you can play around with and do. Let me click back and show you, just you there are so many options. You can change background colors.

Christina Orleans [00:46:41]:
You can play around. Just look for some some basic WordPress tutorials if you're looking for things like that, but this is how easy it is for you to create your own strategic homepage. So if you have any questions about any of this, please, reach out, ask the questions in the chat, and I will be there to help. Thank you so much for being here. I really appreciate it.
