[00:00:00.000] - Liz Stapleton, Host
All right, guys. I'm super excited for this next session from Michelle Jackson of Michelle's Money Hungry. I'm always a fan of her site name. Michelle, thank you so much for agreeing to do this.

[00:00:09.290] - Michelle Jackson
Thank you so much, Liz, for having me join you and be a part of the Summit. I'm super excited about talking all things content creation.

[00:00:18.960] - Liz
Yeah, and so, I know some of the reasons I wanted to reach out to you to have this on is because you, I feel like, take content creation to another level. Because, yes, you have a blog, but you also write books. And I feel like you told me you bang out a draft for a book in a week, which is insane. So your present... Yeah, sorry. Go ahead. You were going to say something.

[00:00:39.990] - Michelle
I do things fast, fast and ugly. And we'll get into that in a second.

[00:00:45.890] - Liz
Yes, because your presentation is called Do It Ugly. Can you give us the highlights of what you're going to cover?

[00:00:51.830] - Michelle
So what I've noticed is most content creators, most would be content creators really hesitate on getting things out there because they want things to be perfect. In fact, the more I create content, the more I've decided to allow my stuff to be a little bit ugly to prove the point that you can get things out there, refine them over time and still make money from day number one.

[00:01:17.750] - Liz
Yes, because you. Certainly do that for sure. So, let's go ahead and get started. I'm excited to see what you have to say.

[00:01:25.610] - Michelle
I've got so many words.

[00:01:28.670] - Liz
You what?

[00:01:29.960] - Michelle
I've got so many words, so many things to say. Okay. I'd like to talk about content creation from a different perspective. Normally in a session like this, it's very tempting for the host to try and tell you how to actually make the content, content such as blog post, vlogs, opt-ins, e-books, courses, podcast episodes. But quite frankly, if you're watching this, my hope is that you have at least a basic understanding of how to do that already. Creating content can become really overwhelming. And because of that, many people do the bare minimum, and that's really a mistake. Digital content creators have to create content. It doesn't mean that you have to do it every day, but you have to create pieces of content that can be repurposed and used in more than one place. I would like to have you think of your content in the following way. What purpose does it serve? Are you're you hoping to get people into your business funnel and connect with them over time? Do you want to get people used to making purchases from you so they get in your funnel and you're emailing them and kind of communicating with them, and then one day you let them know about a good or service? Or, are you answering a question that people always ask you all the time? Excuse me, a little hiccup there.

[00:02:54.720] - Michelle
The other thing you should think about when you're thinking about content is, who are you serving with the information that you're putting out in the world? And what change are you trying to help people achieve? Here are some tips and lessons to help you achieve the following results: consistency, engagement, community, and hopefully, income. And, I want you to kind of consider what to expect from the content creation process. So tip number one: create a tagline that helps people enjoying your content, understand what it is you actually do and who you serve. This one small action will create huge results. You just don't want people guessing what it is you do. It just creates clarity. Honestly, I'm going to be totally honest. I really struggled with this because I do more than one thing. I'm multi-passionate like many people who are online. I have more than one area of focus. But, as I worked on this process, I learned that really what I like doing is helping people move forward by taking action and finishing the actual projects that they are working on.

[00:04:10.220] - Michelle
I like to cheer them on and coach them and get them from beginning to end. And so you'll notice in my newer content, if you're familiar with "Michelle's Money Hungry", my tagline now is helping online creators make money with what they already know. Now you'll hear this in my podcast episodes in particular, that's really where you'll hear that. You might see that on my blog, on the front page. But if I'm a guest on someone else's website, on someone else's podcast, on their blog, I'm going to more than likely reference that. The reason why that tagline is so important is it's an umbrella for the services that I offer, such as instructing new authors via my Make Money with E-books course. So I make money with ebooks and I teach other people how to do that with a course. So that's content creation, that's instruction of a sort. I have a coaching program. So it's called the "Brand Building Lab" and I coach people and work with them to get from beginning to done. Again, that's instructing people in a certain way. And then I also run webinars and podcasts where I kind of do the same thing.

[00:05:24.340] - Michelle
I'm helping move people from one spot to another, like from one point to another. So if you haven't done that, I strongly recommend that you do it, especially because of the time of year that this conference is coming out. It's a perfect time of year to tighten that up so that moving forward, it's easier for you to share what you do to create content based on what your tagline is, and for people to understand who you serve and like who you are. So definitely focus on figuring out what your simple tagline is so that people don't have to guess. You might need to talk to your friends to get some suggestions and input and insight, and they might surprise you in terms of what they think you actually do. So this might be something that you should consider doing, which is talk to your friends and colleagues and people that you've served to see what their perception is of what you do. You might be surprised.

[00:06:27.970] - Michelle
So lesson number one is understanding that each piece of content that you create really begins a process of A/B testing. So you don't just drop a piece of content out there and then it's living out in the world and never return back to it. You're going to spend time observing what happens with that piece of content. Do people opt into it? Do people email you about it? Do people give you comments about it? Do people hate it? Do people unsubscribe? Do they ask additional questions that could be added into that opt-in? So spend some time really observing what happens with the opt-ins or other pieces of content you create, whether it's a blog, podcast, whatever, look into and research the feedback and reactions that you're getting on the content you're creating.

[00:07:24.350] - Michelle
Lesson number two: make it super easy for people to get to your content. If you're going on a podcast interview, use a pretty link that is super easy for people to remember and get to your content. So if you run a website that you don't own, so basically you'll host it like on blogger or that thing, it might be hard for people to remember that your website is prettyturtle.blogpost.com. That's a lot to remember. So when you're on interviews or you're a guest on other people's websites or on their blog, really think about how to simplify the URLs that you're sharing with other people that direct them to the stuff that you do and the content that you're creating.

[00:08:18.150] - Michelle
You want it easy. One of the things that no one tells you is that something as simple as your blog post URL can make or break the searches leading to your website. So before I would have posts that would be like MichellesMoneyHungry.com, because MichellesMoneyHungry is my website. So MichellesMoneyHungry.com/things-that-I-like-to-think-about blah, blah, blah. That is a crazy long URL. It's very difficult to remember. The Google... It's not Google searchable. It's just too much. So now if you were to see the URLs that I share, it would be something like this: MichellesMoneyHungry.com/timetolaunch. That is actually a post that I did. And that URL is SEO specific to the topic that I shared in that post. So make things easy for people in terms of directing them to your content. Also, you can use text-to-opt-in, which is a service that gets people... They're on their phones usually when they're looking at your information or engaging with your content. So text-to-opt-in as a service may be a great way to direct them to the content you're creating. Leadpages still has that in beta. I actually used text to opt in on Leadpages quite a bit last year, but it was a little glitchy. So I'm waiting for them to refine that and make that better so that I can start sharing it again. I should also say that I had a really difficult time keeping things simple with this because I have a lot of things that I want people to do. I want them to get on my email list. I want them to take my course. I want them to read my romance books or my non-fiction books. I want them to engage in my coaching. So there's all these things that I do. But honestly, those are too many things for people to figure out and focus on. So instead, I had to simplify things because honestly, three links to an opt-in, a post, a blog or a blog, that's too much. There are too many actions that people have to take. Give them just one.

[00:10:46.280] - Michelle
So tip number two is now, or rather tip number two is direct people to do one thing, just to take one action. That's it. Now I make sure to direct people using my content to take one clear action. For me, currently that action is getting on my email list. So for 2020, the only thing I want people to do is get on my email list. That's it. That's all I want them to do. So if I'm a guest on a podcast, I only share an opt-in that is made for that audience, and the goal is to get people on my email list. If I am writing a blog post on my own site, the goal is to get them on my email list. If I am on Twitter or Instagram and I'm sharing some information, the goal is to get them on my email list. Once they're on my email list, I can share the other things. So it takes some of the pressure off and it makes it easier for me because I only need them to do one thing, even though I don't like this, one thing.

[00:11:53.000] - Michelle
Lesson number three, and this is the final lesson, your content needs to do what it promised to do. It doesn't need to be pretty. Please stop using the excuse that you need better camera quality for your blogs, the perfect audio set up for your podcast, or a pretty, pretty free or paid course. Just get stuff done, improve your content with the feedback that you receive and keep it moving. So once you launch your products, your goods, your services, your courses, your blog post, whatever it is you're doing, get it out in the world because it takes time to refine it.

[00:12:32.930] - Michelle
My blog post from 2012 versus the post now are completely different. They were crappy in 2012. Why? Because I was new to blogging. I was new to crafting content. I was new to SEO. I was new to everything. I was just excited to get my story out there. But again, if you're watching this, you're probably thinking, I'd like to help people. I'd like to help myself. I'd like to make money. I'd like to get people to do certain things. So I'm going to tell you your first iteration of whatever it is you're going to do is not going to be as good as the 100th iteration of whatever it is that you do. It's just how it is. That's why there's this thing called practice. Get stuff done and get it out there.

[00:13:24.310] - Michelle
So tip number three is do it ugly. Your ugly is probably probably not as ugly as you think it is. I used to hate doing live streams because I felt awkward and weird. And I know that sometimes I stutter or stumble on my words. But over time, as I did it over and over again, it's gotten better. And people really enjoy them. And I've learned how to interact with people, what to talk about, what to consider in terms of content. It's the same thing with whatever you're doing with whatever content you're creating. You're probably doing a much better job with the content that you're creating than you ever would expect, but you can't improve it unless you get it out there. Done is better than pretty. Just is. Done is better than perfect. It's just done is always better.

[00:14:20.280] - Michelle
I'd like to dive a little deeper into the whole idea of A/B testing your content. Here's the thing. Sometimes you'll create something that seems to fall flat with your audience, but that might not be the case. Here are a couple of things that you can do before kicking that resource or content to the curb. So the first thing is conduct a survey to see if what you've put out there actually addresses an issue or concern that your community is actually struggling with or cares about. You can use Survey Monkey to do this, or you can ask questions via Instagram and get answers in real time: Twitter, Facebook, or whatever platform your people are hanging out with and interact with you the most. Obviously, if you have an email list, which I really hope you do, you will communicate with the people on your list and survey them as well. So quite frankly, I would do all of them. So in my case for Michelle is Money Hungry, I have an email list. I have podcast listeners. I have people on different social media platforms, and those are the places where I need to be addressing any questions, issues or whatever. I just need to talk to those people.

[00:15:41.880] - Michelle
So, what does it look like to survey your community? Super easy. Make it really easy. Literally ask one question and be direct. Hey, I just dropped such and such resource. How did you like it? What could make it better? Or it could be, what do you need? What are you dealing with? What are you struggling with? So let your audience lead the conversation and the direction that you're going with the content that you create. Several years ago, not several, like a year and a half to two years ago, I would create for many, many years. That sounds so confusing. Anyway, from 2012 until 2018, at least, I would create a lot of random freaking content. I was definitely talking about personal finance, but then I veer off like I did in this video because I'm human. I would veer off and talk about the weather. I would veer off and talk about emotions, not necessarily related to money. I would veer off and talk about something else. And that is something that can happen a lot when you're creating content. It has to be very intentional and focused. And for that to happen, you just have to play around over time to get a feeling of your voice within your blog or audio content, video content, who you're serving, what their needs are, what they want from you. So the content that I make now versus before is very different. And the leading question that I ask myself is this, what's in it for them? So I try not to write content where the question is framed as what's in it for me. I try to write content from the consumer's perspective, like, how am I helping them do a thing? How am I entertaining them? How am I educating them? How am I moving them from point A to point Z? So, when I create my content now, I'm very intentional about making sure that it moves the needle for the people who are enjoying it. Or else why bother?

[00:18:12.050] - Michelle
Is your content easy to connect with and consume? So, are you sharing your content in ways that's confusing to your community? An example of this would be a URL with a lot of digits, and numbers, and dashes. So if I were to share a PDF where to get to that PDF, it's michellesmanyhungry.com/1-2-mjk-4, that is so complicated and confusing, no one's going to remember that. No one's going to remember that. You have to make it so easy. So something like michellesmoneyhungry.com/helpful-pdf.

[00:18:58.780] - Michelle
And when you're sharing links and ways to get to your content, also keep in mind search engine optimization. So I used to have all these URLs that made no sense. And so they would be very confusing to Google and to whatever search engines are out there. So now I make sure that my URLs actually make sense for two reasons. One, I want to share them and make it easy for people to find the stuff that I'm sharing. And two, I want to make sure that search engines completely understand what the content is that I'm actually sharing. Also, if you are sharing text-to-opt-in, test that out.

[00:19:47.440] - Michelle
I actually found out that there were problems with my lead pages, text-to-opt-in, after a huge podcast interview where I was the guest. I had a resource that I shared and people were opting in. And then other people were like, we can't opt-in, we're having problems. So what I realized was that text to opt in was still in beta. And so I think it's still glitchy. But if I tested it out for a couple of different opt-ins, I think I probably would have noticed that and would have opted to do something else to share the PDF before going on that very large podcast. Are the tools that you're using mobile-friendly? So are the tools that you're using to share your content with mobile-friendly? If you go on the LightRail here in Denver or anywhere else in the US, you will see 60 people with their heads down looking at their phone, scrolling through it. You'll see 15 other people, I call them psychopaths, 15 other people on their iPads. And then the psychopaths will be the five people reading books. I would be one of those people. Most people are consuming a large amount of digital content via their cell phones.

[00:21:11.870] - Michelle
So go onto your phone and look at how your content looks, how easy it is to consume, how easy it is to listen to podcast episodes that you're sharing, how easy it is to watch a vlog if you are running a YouTube channel, how easy it is to download things, how easy it is to opt in and sign up for stuff, test it out. You don't have to do it for every item that you're putting out there, but it might be a best practice that you should start. Now, the other issue could be when you're sharing your content. One of the things I now do is I share my content later in the day. The reason why I do this is I started to notice across the board for every project that I have. And I actually have three, I have my romance novels that I write. I have Michelle's Money Hungry and all the things that are umbrella-ed under that. And then I have Square State, which is all about Colorado and all the things that are that. So I have a couple of different email lists that I manage. And I just noticed over time for those specific lists that people were a lot more responsive during the evenings, later in the day, later in the afternoon, partly because I have people who are on the list who don't live in my state.

[00:22:36.140] - Michelle
So, you might want to see via Google Analytics or doing a survey as well, Hey, where are you guys living? Where are you from? To give you a better idea of some of the unspoken trends or issues related to where your people really physically are. So most of the people who contact or who connect with my Square State information, they're Americans. Like hands down, they're almost all from the US. At this point in time. But maybe in May that will change to British tourists because maybe they're searching for content and information to prepare them for a trip to Colorado. Likewise, my Michelle is Money Hungry, content has very specific people looking at it. So what I've noticed is when I share that content on Pinterest, weirdly enough, I have a huge number of people in New York consuming it, a huge number of people in L.A. consuming it. And then everything else is like a lot less, like other places are a lot less in terms of people consuming that content.

[00:23:57.470] - Michelle
So, look at your analytics, spend some time in the back end of your website, your shows, your podcast, your blogs, and check it out. You don't have to do it daily. In fact, I would say that's a little excessive, but you could do it once every two weeks just to give you an idea of where people are so that you know that you're releasing things at the time that they're available to consume them. And also I look at when I look at people's stuff. So one of the habits that I've gotten into is researching how I look for things. So I figure that I'm my own ideal client avatar. So I'm my own ideal client avatar, excuse me. So I looked at my own habits in terms of how I searched for things, how I looked for solutions, how I looked for information. And that was a very interesting snapshot into what I do. So you may want to do the same. Look at what your last Google searches were. Look at how you found Facebook groups to inspire and educate you. Look at how you found podcast episodes to educate yourself and entertain yourself. What blogs do you like to subscribe to or watch? So spend some time observing your own habits so that you can project those out in terms of what your own avatars are doing.

[00:25:47.880] - Michelle
Actually, the last thing I would say is, as you're sharing information out there, don't be shy about how often you're sharing it. At the time I'm recording this, it's the beginning of 2020. How many election commercials have you seen today? My point exactly. You've seen them all day long. All day long. You've seen them at the Super Bowl while you're watching the Super Bowl. So people are very much motivated to share as often as possible their stuff, their content, their books, their content that they're creating for you to enjoy. Okay? So don't be shy about doing, about sharing your information more than you think you should. Share it. Because if you don't, we don't know what you have out there in the world. We just don't. We're busy. I am busy. I have a lot going on. And so more often than not, I miss the stuff that you share just like everybody else. So if I were to look in my emails, especially if you're thinking about email marketing, there are so many emails I never, ever, ever open because I can't keep up with them. And then I'll go back and open them because I don't unsubscribe from the list. I just don't have the time to connect with all that information. So that's probably the case for the people that follow you. They may be busy. And then one day they'll go back into your content or whatever it is, whatever it is that you're sharing and check it out. So don't be shy about sharing your stuff because we don't know what you're doing if you don't share it with us.

[00:27:36.140] - Michelle
And then finally, try to create content that converts. And what what I mean by that is I alluded to the fact that before I would write all these random posts and they were good and interesting, but they weren't going to grow my page views the way I wanted them to. They weren't going to connect with the people I was trying to really help. And, there's a reason why those how-to posts are so popular. Are you answering questions that people are looking for solutions to? Are you, again, looking into Google to see, to gain insight into how you look for helpful content. That is something to think about. Make sure as you create content that you're doing a thing. That thing is helping people. How you help them is based on the title, the SEO, the solution that you provide. Again, how to post is a great way to start. You can check out more information just by Googling people's content to see what they're sharing.

[00:28:51.230] - Michelle
Finally, if you're stumped on what to create, here are some of my favorite types of content in no particular order. Podcast interviews as the guest. Those are so awesome, and I'll tell you why, because you don't have to edit the show. You don't have to manage anything with it. All you have to do is share the content. Insta-stories. Those are great, too, because you can just pop on 10 minutes from now. You could just pop on and talk to people and share a resource and there you go. And you can ask them to slide into your DMs to get a link to it. Free mini courses via Thinkific or Teachable. I currently use Thinkific as my course platform, but both do the same thing. They're both great. Create a free mini course that helps people out. I love them. Powerpoints. I actually use Google Slides or Canva actually has great templates for PowerPoints. And so you're able to really highlight and share cool pieces of information, solutions, that kind of thing for the people you're trying to help, downloadable PDFs, and of course, podcasts as the host that actually owns the show. Vlogs, I don't really create vlogs, so that's why I like Insta-stories, so that's where my video content is being generated. So hopefully this was helpful to you. There's so many ways to create content, so many reasons why you should be doing it. Honestly, I want to challenge you to create one new opt-in or resource or product, not even product, just like something cool to help your community every month for the next 12 months, 12 things. You'll far exceed that. But for some of you, it may feel like a big ask. It's not. You've got this. I can't wait to check out the stuff that you're sharing. And thank you so much for watching.

[00:30:59.920] - Liz
Michelle, thank you so much. That was so helpful. I am excited to do things a little more ugly, for sure.

[00:31:09.720] - Michelle
I hope that people have been inspired to take action and just get things out there in the world. It takes a little while for you to get the feedback that you need in order to refine, improve and really perfect, what you're doing. So please, everyone who's watched this, get your stuff out there. Do it ugly. Make sure you grab the opt-in as well, which is at MichellesMoneyHungry.com/do-it-ugly

[00:31:38.440] - Liz
And the link is below. Why don't you tell them what that is a little bit?

[00:31:42.670] - Michelle
Basically, it's a mini course that goes through whether or not you want to start a blog, a podcast, write your first book or create your first course, and just the bare bones actions that you need to take in order to get it out there.

[00:31:58.840] - Liz
Yeah. So definitely go grab that, guys. Michelle just creates amazing things. I know she calls them ugly, but they're not. She's always making... I'm like, what have you done lately? Because there's always something new. Definitely go grab that for sure. And Michelle, thank you so much for this session. I think it's been a fantastic day to learn a lot.

[00:32:19.070] - Michelle
Thank you so much for having me and much success with the Summit.
