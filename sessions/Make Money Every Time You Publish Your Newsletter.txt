All right, guys. I'm super excited for this next speaker who has spoken at the summit numerous times. I'm really excited to have her back. She's a certified business growth coach for digital product entrepreneurs. She helps business owners to next their digital product revenue without needing to be glued to their desk, constantly live launching or worrying about social media algorithms. A big warm welcome to Dr. Destini Copp. Destini, thank you so much for coming back.

[00:00:35.240] - Destini Copp
Liz, I'm super excited to be here today and talking about one of the subjects that I am extremely passionate about.

[00:00:42.910] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Yes, I love because you were telling me right before we started recording that you've actually done a six-month research study on this topic. In case you guys missed the title topic, we're talking newsletters. I'm really excited to dive in and find out what you learned from that, where the gaps are. So do you want to explain that study to us real quick, and then we'll get to the questions?

[00:01:04.940] - Destini Copp
Yeah. So I think it'll be important for me to set the stage, if you would, for everybody, and why I actually started going down this path is because I felt like what I was doing and what I had been told all of these years for my newsletter was take your pillar content. For me, that's my podcast. For somebody else, it might be their blog or Maybe they're doing some YouTube videos or whatever. But for me, it was my podcast. So I was taking my podcast, sharing it with my audience, basically having that one call to action in there. And I realized this isn't really doing what it should be doing or what I think it could be doing. And I felt like I was really missing the boat. And one of the reasons when I put my college marketing professor hat on, which I still teach at the university level, I put that hat on. I was like, you know what? I need to think about that customer journey that I'm taking everybody on. And when they get my email newsletter, and they're probably knowing that it's about my podcast, right? Because that's that pillar content that I was sending out.

[00:02:18.780] - Destini Copp
It was like some people were... I was getting decent opens and decent clicks, so that wasn't the issue. But I just felt like I was a little bit wasting my time, if you would, because Just think about what you might be doing if you get that type of email. I know what I was doing when I got an email from somebody that I absolutely loved, and I knew it was about her weekly podcast. So it had nothing to do with her content or her in general, I wasn't opening it. I was actually just deleting it and moving on because I knew it was going to be sitting in my podcast app whenever I wanted to go look at it. I was like, Okay, so if that's the behavior that I'm doing for somebody I absolutely love, obviously this isn't working for me. It's just probably not working for a lot of people who are in this blogging, creator, coaching niche. I was like, I need to really figure this out. And that's when I started that research study, which expanded to six months. I really looked outside of this niche, if you would, in this industry, and looked at other people who I felt like were doing a really good job in this area and looked at what they were doing differently and implemented that in my business.

[00:03:40.690] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Okay. So what are the key elements that differentiate newsletters that are consistently generating revenue and getting opens and clicks and those that don't? I think you touched on the don't where they know exactly what's going to be inside it, why would they open it? But what was working? What was getting people to open? What was making it different?

[00:04:01.270] - Destini Copp
Yeah. So one of the things I noticed when I did this research study was there's obviously different structures to newsletters where people can be successful. Some people are doing these minimalist type newsletters. Some people were doing these really long form type newsletters. Some people were in the middle, if you would. But one thing that I noticed, that I noticed consistently with people and businesses out there that where I knew that they were being successful with it because it was obvious. Number one, a lot of these newsletters had been sold. So it was like a product, a business, just in and of itself, just from that newsletter. So I know that they were making money. I know that there was value in the marketplace for them. A lot of them got purchased by larger, bigger type companies. And one of the things I noticed that they were doing is what I call this magazine type approach to newsletters. I really want to bring everybody back to maybe when they were in high school or somewhere else, and they were waiting for their latest issue of maybe Glamor or Cosmo coming in the mail, and you just were so excited to get it.

[00:05:21.380] - Destini Copp
You ran out to the mailbox, you got it, you opened it up, you'd read it several times, maybe even dog-eared some pages. And What I liked about this newsletter, or this, I should say this magazine approach that a lot of these newsletter operators were doing was it was different sections in their newsletter, so they're breaking it up in different sections. They were monetizing it in different ways. So that was another thing they were doing differently. But one of the things that that newsletter magazine approach allows you to do, or a couple of things that allows you to do, it allows you to basically break up your newsletter. So if you have a section in your newsletter that might not appeal to one person, there's most likely going to be another section that's going to appeal to them. So when you think about my email list and I have a lot of different types of businesses on my email list. I might have bloggers, I might have digital product creators, I might have service providers. All of them want digital products at some point, or maybe they already have them, but there's a lot of nuances, quite frankly, with a lot of that.

[00:06:33.450] - Destini Copp
So tailoring your content and put it in different sections was something that they were doing differently.

[00:06:40.970] - Liz Stapleton, Host
You're not segmenting so that certain people only see certain sections. Everyone can look at all the sections and decide what's right for them.

[00:06:50.150] - Destini Copp
Yeah, they can look at it. People are going to skim, right? Sure. They're just going to open it. They're going to skim it really fast. So you need to make sure that the sections are set up so there's a lot of white space between them, maybe even some dividers. So allow them to skim down there, and they will pick up on what they like. And you can tell what they like by where they're clicking or if they're responding back to you. And when I did the research study and I started making changes in my email newsletter, and I did it over time. So I started testing things and trying to figure out, was this working or was this working? And finally, it really started clicking. And I knew that it was working when I had people that were starting to email me back. And this actually happens almost every single week when they were starting to email me back saying, your emails are so good that I started putting them in a special folder and saving them and going back and reading them later. I'm like, okay, so now I know I've hit the nail on my head that this is actually valuable to people.

[00:07:59.600] - Liz Stapleton, Host
All right. Can you give some examples of sections? Just to get people's wheels turning of what they might include in their newsletter?

[00:08:07.980] - Destini Copp
Yeah. So that's a great question. And what I always do when I'm working with my members in my Newsletter Profit Club on this, I always tell them to think about who's your ideal reader, what are they interested in learning about. So you got to keep them, as you can do everything in your business. So I'm not telling people who are watching this, well, they don't know. But you got to keep that in mind. So it's not all about you and what you're doing, but your ideal reader. And also think about what things are you wanting to promote in your business? So are you wanting to promote your digital products? Are you wanting to promote a membership? Are you wanting to promote a podcast, right? Or your pillar content? You still want people to, How do you feel about that. Are you promoting events and workshops on a regular basis? So basically how I have structured, I can give you a couple of examples here because I run four different newsletters, but I'll give you some B2C examples and B2B examples. So in my B2B business, so I'll just talk about my creator's MBA newsletter. In that, I always have an intro, like a hook, and I might even have a little I'll call it a table of contents, but it's basically, here's what's included in this newsletter.

[00:09:34.220] - Destini Copp
So people can very quickly say, here's what they know what to expect. I have a new episode section for my podcast. I have a section for upcoming events and workshops, because I do on a regular basis, I'm either hosting something, it might be a free training, like tomorrow I'm just doing something off the cuff, just super training, no pitch, that thing. So I might promote stuff like that.

[00:10:01.580] - Liz Stapleton, Host
I might be- You're hopefully promoting this in that section?

[00:10:04.070] - Destini Copp
Yes, absolutely. So in addition to the solo email I might send out for an event that's coming up, I also put it in that section in the newsletter. Just because people don't see everything that you're sending out. So sending it out multiple times, and they know. They expect that to be in my newsletter because it's in there every single week. So they know something. Generally, I don't think I've ever had a week, honestly, in my personal brand, where there's not been anything there. So a featured product, which could be a product that you are promoting. It could be affiliate product. It could be other ways that you're monetizing. Or it could be, sometimes I've had people sponsor my newsletter and paid me to include one of their products or a free lead magnet, and I might put it in that section. Now, I'm always very clear, anything that's been sponsored or paid, you have to, just like you would at a blog post. But you can still, it doesn't have to be-

[00:11:06.840] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Yeah, you just need your disclosure. It's just disclosure for the link. Yeah.

[00:11:12.210] - Destini Copp
Yeah. So that's another section. And then the other two sections that I have in my Creators MBA, I have a quick tips one, my favorite one. And I'll tell you, this is probably where I get the most feedback that people love it. It's called my Bookmark worthy section. And really what I try to put in that section is things that really make people think. It might be forward thinking things that are going on in the industry. Like, for instance, in this past week's newsletter, in that section, I started talking about Custom Chatbots and how you can use those in your courses, in your digital products, in your memberships to help your students get results faster, just like you're sitting next to them as a one-on-one tutor. So that's the stuff I like to include in that bookmark worthy section. And then after that, I just have my outro, and I might have a little checklist, if you would, before you go do this, this, this, this, and this, and then just end it out. In all of my newsletters, I also have, if you want to work with me in my one-on-one coaching, you can apply here to work with me.

[00:12:29.640] - Destini Copp
So So you can include sections like that. So if you're doing coaching or, Here's how you can work with me type things, you can include that also. So that's the B2B top example. And honestly, in my B2C, which is my hobby school brand, in that particular brand, we do online learning, virtual summits, and all kinds of different hobby type niches. And I'm going to think about this for a second, so I hope I don't forget anything. I I do have a podcast there, too, so I have that. I'm also promoting events and workshops, so we do a lot because that audience, they love, love, love, love Summits. So I always like to find ones to promote there. I have a feature product because we have a Shopify store for that brand. So I like to promote the products that we have in the Shopify store. And then also have, I'll call it a get creative prompt. So it can be something related to maybe what we're talking about in the newsletter that particular week. So it might be related to quilting, or I think this past week we were doing a Halloween type email newsletter, so it was related to Halloween.

[00:13:49.620] - Destini Copp
And then I also have a community type section where I might link back to what we're doing in the Facebook group, because that particular brand has a very large and active Facebook group. I might link back to that, say, Come join the conversation here type thing. The same format with the intro and outro and all that good stuff.

[00:14:12.150] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Okay. I like that. It's already giving me idea. I was like, I'm not fully... Because I do have a podcast, too, and I send out the, Here's the new episode, What You'll Learn. But this last week, actually, because I didn't get schedule ahead time, I was like, I have a lot of things I need to tell them. I actually added a bunch of other stuff in. It definitely did better. I was Well, now I need to step this up. So I'm already like, Wait, maybe I can structure this how Destini says. So lots of really good ideas. Okay. I love those layouts. I wanted to follow up. We're talking newsletters. How often should you publish a newsletter when you're trying to market? Like, does frequency affect the earnings? Could you do it more than once a week? Should it just be once a week? Have you dug into that information at all or thoughts?

[00:14:59.500] - Destini Copp
I I will say in that research study that I did, it was all over the board. So I would say that whatever works for you. I recommend a minimum of a once per week, just because people just forget about you, right? So a minimum of once per week. I would say that in general, I don't want to say cross-board, but in general, the brands that we're publishing more than once a week are what I would consider a media type publishers. So they have a whole team of people working on this stuff. I'm just one person, right? So it would be almost impossible for me to do what I do in my Sunday email newsletters to do it more than once a week. Now, it doesn't mean I'm not sending out other emails. This week, I did my Sunday newsletter. I am promoting a summit also. So I did my solo email that went out today. So I'm still sending multiple emails, but that weekly newsletter, it takes me... In my personal brand, I calculated it this past Sunday because I was so late doing it. And I sat down at 6:30 in the morning. I started working on it.

[00:16:13.290] - Destini Copp
I got done at 8:30. So it It's going to be two hours to do that. I can really only do that once per week. Sure.

[00:16:19.180] - Liz Stapleton, Host
I like it. And just did the day matter? Do you think it matters what day your weekly newsletter is coming out if you're managing once a week, or just be consistent with whatever day you choose?

[00:16:29.290] - Destini Copp
I would just say Be consistent and just test it out with your audience and see what appeals to them. I just landed on Sunday's just because that was, honestly, it was easier for me, and I felt like they were getting a good amount of opens and engagement. I'm just sitting with that right now.

[00:16:48.000] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Okay. And within those sections, are you repurposing content that you've done before so it's not new material every time, or is it, at least for now, new each time?

[00:16:59.880] - Destini Copp
So that's a great question. I would say that for the most part, it's new material. Now, that being said, in Hobby School this past week, the podcast episode that we did, it was a It was like a paranormal investigator type episode. And I was doing a Halloween email newsletter. I'm like, Oh, my gosh, this podcast would be perfect. So I did repurpose that and did it again. And who cares? People Nobody remembers. So if you want to repurpose, repurpose. But I will say one thing I have not been doing as much, but I am absolutely going to start doing this going forward, is taking a lot of this juicy content that I am publishing in my email newsletter and also repurposing that on social media. I've done it here and there. Haven't been super consistent with it just because I've been so busy. But 2025, I'm going to start getting very more, I guess, focused on social media than I have been in the past. So that's one of my goals is to take a lot of this juicy content that I have published already in my email newsletters and repurpose that on social media.

[00:18:16.500] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Okay. Next question. How are you tracking and measuring the success of the newsletters, whether that's in terms of revenue generation? Are there other metrics you're really looking at? How are you gaging the success?

[00:18:30.550] - Destini Copp
So some of it's replies. People are emailing me back saying, Oh, I got one. I actually got one this morning. I sent out that one of the emails, got an email back, and I felt like this was written just for me. You really this resonated with me type email. So replies are very important because if somebody... And that was a nonprofit reply. If somebody sends you something like that back, you know that whatever you did is really hitting home. Those I love. I do share. So I do track the share. So I'm in the spark loop for my personal brand. I'm in that. So you can track people's shares, and they get some gifts back depending on how they share. I may be butchering some of that. I'm also in the creator network, so I do track that, too.

[00:19:31.770] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Do you make these public for your creator network page?

[00:19:35.970] - Destini Copp
I do. All of my email newsletters, anybody can go for Hobby School, my personal brand, even the other newsletters that I do that are public. Anybody can go see those.

[00:19:50.750] - Liz Stapleton, Host
In case you guys are wondering, we're talking about Convert kit. I use Convert kit as well, which is why it's familiar. But anyone's like, What are you talking about? Creator Network, and this is a feature of Convert kit.

[00:20:00.060] - Destini Copp
Yes. So there is a way to go out where you can publish them to the web. Some people actually may test this in the future. Some people actually take their newsletter content and publish them as a blog on their website. Now, I have not done that. I did see that in the research study. So I can't really, since I haven't tried it myself, I haven't tested it. I can't really speak to the effectiveness of it. But some people are doing that. So I don't know. The other things I look at, of course, no surprise here, right? Open rates, click-through rates. Click-through rates are important. I do a lot of sponsorships. So in the Hobby School brand, somebody might pay me to promote one of their workshops, or I might send out a total email that's strictly focused on promoting one of their webinars or whatever. So I have to really pay close attention to click-through rates. That's the main thing that they're focused on for that.

[00:21:06.050] - Liz Stapleton, Host
And are you just relying on the data from Convert kit? Are you using UTMs? Are you using anything like that to help measure?

[00:21:14.350] - Destini Copp
I do have UTM set up, but I am primarily looking at the Convert kit data. But I do have all the UTM set up and Google Analytics and all that good stuff.

[00:21:26.130] - Liz Stapleton, Host
All right. No, I like that. Okay. I have two more questions. I'll wrap up. First of all, what are some mistakes you see people making with their newsletters? Not just in terms of content, but just things that could maybe be hurting their open rights, or just what should people avoid doing? I feel like as much as it's important to learn what to do, it's just as important to learn what not to do. And so any feedback you have there?

[00:21:51.630] - Destini Copp
Yeah, I would say spend a good amount of time on your subject line. I use AI to help me with that. I don't completely rely on AI. What I would generally do, once I've gotten my entire newsletter written, I will upload that into Claude. You could do Claude, ChatGPT. Sometimes I'll test them both to see if which one comes up better. So I'll upload it in that. I'll say, Can you give me 20 plus email subject lines and give me some variety? Include some questions in there include some suspensful titles, like YouTube type titles. Those tend to work very well if you can get in in that. Give me some without columns. All the AI loves to use the columns all the time. There's other things you can put in there. Just give me some variety, maybe include some emojis. See what it comes back with. I'll generally will pick a few that I like, and then I'll go back and say, Can you rate these? I out of 10? And just let it go through and rank them for you and see which ones they think the AI might think perform better. I can tell you the ones I think might perform, the AI is generally better at predicting that.

[00:23:16.460] - Destini Copp
The other tool that I use is subjectlines.Com. So that's a tool that I use. I love that tool. It works very well, too. So I spend a good amount of time on the subject lines and the preview text.

[00:23:32.020] - Liz Stapleton, Host
I do think preview text is underutilized by a lot of people. Even me, I will say the only time I ever really remember to do it is when I'm sending out an affiliate email because I don't want the preview to be the affiliate disclosure, which is oftentimes first in my newsletter to make sure that it's compliant, but I should do a better job at using it in general for every single e-mail I send out. That was just my thought. Okay, so Anything else you feel like people should know in terms of creating newsletters that are going to earn them money every time they sell them out?

[00:24:09.010] - Destini Copp
Going back to what I said earlier, think about how you want to monetize your newsletter. The other thing that you may not be thinking about today is sponsorships. There are websites that you can go out, like passionfroot.Me, and it's spelled passionf-r-o-o-t.Me. You can go out there, input your newsletter information, and find sponsors. People go to you. I've had people contact me, especially for my hobby school list, because it's a sizable list, and they're definitely wanting to get in front of that particular audience. So think about sponsorship. There's a lot of different ways that you can make money from your email newsletter that you may not be considering today. So Super easy ways.

[00:25:01.960] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Yeah. I know with Convertit, you can get into the network to get paid for recommending people as well. So there's newsletter monetization is evolving quite a lot, I feel like in the last year or so. And I think we're going to see just more and more of it in 2025. All right, Destini, thank you so much for sharing all this knowledge. Do you have something for attendees you want them to go check out? Where should they find you? All that jazz.

[00:25:26.220] - Destini Copp
Yeah, absolutely. I have my newsletter profit calculator. If you want to input your newsletter information, it's a Google Sheet. You can input your newsletter information in it, and it will basically estimate how much you can earn through each newsletter that you send out. So you can go to destinicopp.Com/calculator and grab that. And just my website is destinicopp.Com. Definitely the best place or the best place to get all the juicy tips that I send out is my email newsletter that we've been talking about all day today. So definitely jump on that.

[00:26:06.560] - Liz Stapleton, Host
All right, guys. And the links for that are going to be below. Make sure you check that out. I think that's the same as me. I will email consistently, no matter what. Me on social media, I'm going to get better this year. I really am. But if you want to hear from Destini for sure, definitely make sure to sign for a newsletter. I feel like I need to go sign up. It sounds really good. Again, Destini, thank you so much for coming back. I really appreciate it.

[00:26:27.310] - Destini Copp
Thanks so much, Liz, for having me.
