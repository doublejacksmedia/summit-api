[00:00:13.550] - Aisha
Hi, everyone. Welcome to the Blogger Breakthrough Summit. So excited to have you here. My name is Aisha Preece, and I'm the founder and owner of personal finance and lifestyle blog and beyond.com.

[00:00:24.460] - Aisha
And I also run three other monetized new sites. And I'm going to teach you about SEO. And how you as a new blogger or maybe you're an advanced blogger, I'm going to teach you how to get lots of Google traffic and what Google love. Okay. So, I know you're busy.

[00:00:38.460] - Aisha
So, let's get to it. Let me share my screen and we can get you learning about SEO, so you can get all this beautiful Google traffic. Okay. So, today, I'm going to teach you the 3-step formula for SEO success. And I'm going to simplify as much as possible because I know there's a lot of information out there that overwhelms us.

[00:00:58.720] - Aisha
And I know as a new blogger, it was like everyone saying something different. There's so much work, probably some of us juggling a full time job. Let's simplify it. What are three steps to take to start getting Google traffic? And so, I'm going to walk you through them now.

[00:01:12.310] - Aisha
Let's take it back a notch and figure out who am I actually, who am I? And why am I teaching you about SEO? So, what we have here is a classic photo of me with a filter. So, yeah, it's a catfish.

[00:01:25.690] - Aisha
I know that looks similar or not, but I set my blog up, my first blog up in 2018, and I did absolutely nothing with it because I didn't know how to do anything with blogging. And I kind of fussed about, didn't get any traffic, didn't get any income. And I really wanted to. I really wanted to earn a full-time income from my blog, but I didn't know how. And so, unfortunately, in October 2019, my best friend passed away suddenly, and this was a wake up call. I said, you know this is my dream.

[00:01:54.570] - Aisha
Do it. If you have a dream, you have one thing you want to do in life, go for it. And so what I did was I said, okay, I'm going to get traffic and income from my blog, and I'm going to make it happen. And I went through a series of mistakes and trials and errors and ugly smocky tears and the crying, wondering if blogging is dead.

[00:02:11.910] - Aisha
I knew the concept of how to make money blogging, but I know to make money blogging, you need traffic, so makes sense, right? And I was living la Vida broker. I could not afford paid traffic, paid ads. I did try Facebook groups. I did try you know, and when you try and be helpful in Facebook.

[00:02:27.610] - Aisha
But the thing about Facebook is there's not a keyboard warriors. I don't know if you've experienced that. And so, I found that I didn't have any control over. Let's say that I was sharing my article. If someone commented in someone else's Facebook group, I didn't have control over that.

[00:02:41.600] - Aisha
And that really got to me, because sometimes people say really mean things. And I did try Pinterest. And I did get a lot of success with Pinterest. But Pinterest is a lot more time consuming compared to Google. Google is way more passive.

[00:02:55.670] - Aisha
And so, another thing that I looked into was what about these SEO agencies, these experts, and guys, they cost so much money, I could not afford it. I couldn't afford an agency. So, I needed to figure out how to do it myself. I did a lot of, I saved up, there's a lot of expensive courses, some were useful, some were completely useless. And you know a lot of them outdated. And Google and SEO now, it changes very often.

[00:03:23.270] - Aisha
And so, the concepts I'm teaching you today are relevant for now, which is quite important, right? And so after all this, you know ugly tears in my living room with snot all over my face, I figured it out. I figured out a three step formula, which I implemented on my first blog. And I was, in September 2020.

[00:03:44.120] - Aisha
I was sitting at about 7000 page views barely. And then I implemented that formula again and again. And seven months later, I got nearly 100,000 page views a month. I qualified for Mediavine in January 2021. And now I just checked the last 30 days.

[00:04:01.260] - Aisha
And I'm sitting at over 140,000 page views, which is so amazing. And I've implemented these strategies, this three step formula in three of my other niche sites, which are now getting incoming traffic. And so, I know they work, especially for new bloggers now. But most importantly, right, this traffic, this SEO traffic has helped me earn a full time income. I now can, you know, spend more time with my loved ones.

[00:04:26.200] - Aisha
I can travel more, hopefully, when the world opens up because of this passive income I'm earning from my blog. Okay. And so, I honestly say SEO changed my life. It honestly changed my life. I can work less and spend more time with my loved ones and do things I love.

[00:04:41.540] - Aisha
And I want it to change yours, too, right? There's an opportunity for all of us. And so, I want SEO to change your life the way it changed mine. And I know what you're thinking because I've been there once. You're thinking this only happens to experienced bloggers.

[00:04:56.630] - Aisha
You're thinking, oh, I need to have a really established website. I need to have blogging for a long time. And I know you're also thinking it's too complicated. And trust me, I was there. I was there where you're sitting right now thinking, how do these bloggers get thousands of page views? How do they get into Mediavine, which is an advertising network.

[00:05:15.040] - Aisha
I was in that position in 2020 and look a year later, and I'm earning a full time income. So, I want you to know it is possible. And so, I'm going to teach you how. Okay. So, a bit of proof.

[00:05:26.940] - Aisha
So, here we go. What we have here is in September 2020. I was sitting at just over 7000 page views. Just seven months later, boom boom, nearly 100,000 page views. I'm so happy.

[00:05:41.380] - Aisha
And I just checked the last 30 days and we're sitting in over 140,000 pages. This should go up because I've published more content. So, this is majority SEO traffic, majority. And so, it's just amazing. Okay, so this is me when I was a lot thinner when I didn't put on weights.

[00:05:59.810] - Aisha
Okay, listen, we got 30 minutes here, 25 now, and dedicate this time to up scaling for yourself, block out all the distractions. Just give yourself 25 minutes to learn this skill, so you can implement it. Another thing is we have you know different types of people here, people coming from different walks of life with different capabilities. And we need to respect that and don't ever feel like you're asking a silly question. So that's a bit to learn, right?

[00:06:24.190] - Aisha
So, someone asked the question, you think that's a basic. It's okay. We all start somewhere. Okay.

[00:06:29.080] - Aisha
And so, let's all respect and grow together with our SEO knowledge. Now, what you're going to learn today? What are you going to learn today, right? So, give me a sec, I have my timer.

[00:06:39.910] - Aisha
I have a timer, so I don't go over. And so what we're going to learn today is this we're going to learn this three step formula that's going to get you SEO traffic. And I know it works because I tried it on all my sites and it's going to simplify the SEO process. So, you can focus on the right things. We already have a million and one things we need to do, right. And so, focusing on the right things every day will help moving forward.

[00:07:02.980] - Aisha
And also, there is no doubt that SEO traffic makes you more money. There is no doubt about that. Ask anybody. It brings me more ad revenue. I looked at the comparison between Pinterest traffic, social media traffic and SEO traffic.

[00:07:17.460] - Aisha
Display advertising networks pay way more for SEO traffic. I earn way more affiliate income. So, I'm sitting and I'm very fortunate that my blog now earns between 8-15,000 USD a month for the first blog. And that's from SEO traffic.

[00:07:31.620] - Aisha
And it's passive. It's more or less passive. You have to do the work now. But then once Google loves you and send you traffic, you can chat, right. And then also your site is way more valuable.

[00:07:41.030] - Aisha
If you want to sell your site one day, buyers love SEO traffic. It's just so much more valuable. So, if you're going to focus on one thing, focus on SEO traffic. Okay. So, I'm also going to throw in some bonus tips if we have time, because, listen, a lot of people here might be new bloggers. And I'm going to share some tips I use on my new sites to skyrocket the traffic, so I'm going to share that with you.

[00:08:04.600] - Aisha
And okay, let's get started. So, this is the formula. Please write this down and it sounds a bit basic but let me explain. The three step formula is this for SEO, you find a good SEO keyword, you've got it.

[00:08:19.270] - Aisha
Okay. You put that keyword in the right place, and then what you do is you supercharge that piece of content with secondary keywords. Now you might think this is a bit foreign language. I'll teach you how. So, if you're going to focus on SEO, these are the three step formally you need to follow.

[00:08:37.850] - Aisha
Find a good keyword. Put that keyword that you find in the right place, supercharge your content that you've just written with a primary keyword with secondary keywords. Okay, so let's step one, finding a good keyword. How do you find a good keyword? And I use this tool, this affordable tool.

[00:08:53.880] - Aisha
It's $17 a month. But you know let's make it easier for you because I get it. I was levied a broker before, right? Sometimes, we just don't have the budget to spend all this money on keywords tools, so it's $17 a month. The first month is free.

[00:09:08.280] - Aisha
I'm going to leave the link below. So, if you click on that and use this discount code Ksdisc, then the first month you'll get free. The second month is also 20% off. And so, you could probably do all your research in one month, the free time. If you need an extra month.

[00:09:23.950] - Aisha
Okay. Use a 20% discount. Boom. All your research done, content plan done for the year. Okay.

[00:09:29.640] - Aisha
And so, let me show you how this works. And so, finding a good keyword is this - people like to give their vague answers. I need data. I want someone to tell me, what do I need to be looking for? And I go for a keyword that has a search volume of more than 70 that has a competition score of less than 30.

[00:09:50.420] - Aisha
Now, the reason for this is there is absolutely no point writing about a topic that no one's looking for. That's the reality. You want to make money from your blog. And you want to get to the page one of Google and get search traffic. You talk about topics that people are actually looking for, right? And so that's number one. Number two is, and the mistake a lot of people make is they write about topics which are super popular, but there's big competition. And as a new blogger, it's very hard for you to rank for on page one when there's big brands on there that Google trust more. And so, it's a fine art, right.

[00:10:24.490] - Aisha
We need to find a keyword that sits in between them. And so how do you do that? And so, let me show you how you do that. So, I'm going to show you a real example of a topic I wrote about. So, let's imagine one of my menu items is digital nomad.

[00:10:37.450] - Aisha
Because I love traveling and working around the world. And so, Imagine you wanted to write about digital nomadism, right. So, I'll show you my key search.

[00:10:45.800] - Aisha
My back end. Okay. So, let me show you how key search works. Remember how I said search volume needs to be more than 70. This is the search volume.

[00:10:58.290] - Aisha
And that's the competition, search volume competition. So, step one, we put in the topic. Is the search volume more than 70, remember the rule? Yes, it's 60,500. You go oooh! You excited.

[00:11:11.830] - Aisha
Hang on. Remember, it needs to be a competition of less than 30. okay. So, we can see immediately this is a bad keyword. Now, just also to explain how keyword research works.

[00:11:24.340] - Aisha
Here are all the other articles ranking on page one. Okay. And so, we can see for sure like Investopedia, entrepreneur, whatever. All these articles, like their domain authority. So, how authorities of Google think they are, anything more than 30 is high.

[00:11:42.200] - Aisha
Okay, if there's no chance, as a new blogger, you're going to rank on page one because it's just a competitive topic. And so what I do to find a good keyword is I add keyword modifiers, which means, for example, let's say, so for example, hiking jackets. You know I'll wrap a hiking jacket, hiking jackets for women, hiking jackets for men, hiking jackets for teenagers, or best earphones for toddlers. And so, let's think you're modifying and making it more niche down and easier to rank for. Okay.

[00:12:14.080] - Aisha
So this is called a long tail keyword. They're longer. So, the keyword modifier I put in because I'm currently stuck in Malaysia, just because of Covid. And so, let's say this is not my Malaysia.

[00:12:28.990] - Aisha
Okay. So, you're thinking, so imagine I'm imagining you go through the keyword research. And so, let's step one. What's the search volume? Minimum 70.

[00:12:37.600] - Aisha
Okay. 70 competition score less than 30 is twelve. If you see a blue keyword, it's time to get really excited because it's very hard to find a blue keyword. Okay. And so, just have a look at the people on page one where we see out and beyond my site ranking on page one, even though my domain is pretty low. Right? And so, I actually targeted this keyword, and I'm ranking on page one because it's a good keyword. Right. And so let's just say, for example, you know you're fashion blogger. Let's say capsule orders.

[00:13:22.130] - Aisha
 Okay, straight away, step one. The keyword volume is more than 70. Okay. Hang on. Don't get excited.

[00:13:29.870] - Aisha
We need to look at the competition score. We can see the competition is way, way too high. It's going to be less than 30. Right. And so, this is the amazing thing about keyword research.

[00:13:38.620] - Aisha
It also shows you alternative keywords you can rank for. It doesn't work for you. And so, let's look here, here's a volume and here's a score. Right. We go down.

[00:13:48.730] - Aisha
We're like, okay. Okay, this, 2020 is nearly over. Maybe I wouldn't mind about that. Okay. Capsule order 2021, scores more than 30. Volume less than 70, bad keywords. But then we go down. Oh, this is exciting. Volume is 5400. Remember, it's going to be more 70.

[00:14:09.310] - Aisha
Okay, but let's check the competition. Competition is 21. This is a good topic. If you're a fashion blogger, capsule wardrobe men is a fantastic keyword. But then here's the thing, right.

[00:14:20.890] - Aisha
This is the great thing about key search. It gives you alternative. Listen, you could write a whole whole, this is your content plan done. Spring capsule wardrobe, winter capsule wardrobe, fall capsule wardrobe. You have so many ideas to write about.

[00:14:34.570] - Aisha
And these are good keywords. Okay, so that's how you find a good keyword. You put the keyword in, add a modifier and have a look if you can find a good keyword there. So, we're finding a keyword. We're celebrating and we're thinking we have the bees needs.

[00:14:49.810] - Aisha
But then let me go back to my screen. But the thing is right. It's quite important that you tell Google about that keyword. So, there's absolutely no point having a keyword keyword. Okay, tell Google about that keyword.

[00:15:03.760] - Aisha
We need to actually look at and tell Google that this is about digital nomad, Malaysia. And so, let, what you do, step two of the formula? Put that keyword that you found in the right place. And so what you do here. Here are all the places that you need to put that keyword. Okay.

[00:15:23.070] - Aisha
You need to tell Google what this article is about. So, you put that keyword in the H1 title, you put it in the subheading, you put it in the first hundred words, you sprinkle it throughout the post. You put it in the URL. Now image file name is when you know save an image and you put on your desktop file image one, file image two. Save it as that keywords.

[00:15:46.590] - Aisha
So, digital nomad, Malaysia. So, when WordPress or whatever webiste you use, they pull it. That keyword comes up in the file image into your site. You put it in the outset and the meta description. Now I'm going to show you practically exactly how this looks like.

[00:16:00.140] - Aisha
So. Let's imagine. So what I'm imagining is it actually happened. So, what happened was, I actually, let's look at the back end of one of my articles, digital nomad Malaysia. So, step one, this is the H1 title, right.

[00:16:12.990] - Aisha
H1. So, let's have a look, 1st 100 word.

[00:16:18.530] - Aisha
Have I sprinkled it? So, I put here. I put in the search digital Nomad in Malaysia. It's got 13 matches, meaning I've mentioned it a few times. So remember, we sprinkle it at the post.

[00:16:27.880] - Aisha
Have it in the H2. So, if you look here, didital nomad Malaysia, this is a H2. Okay. Is it in the URL? 

[00:16:36.520] - Aisha
So, let's have a look at the URL.

[00:16:40.050] - Aisha
Url slug, boom! Digital nomad Malaysia. Okay. Then is it in a meta description? A meta description is this, people, that was a meta description. Let's just say you Google something and this little description comes up.

[00:16:54.830] - Aisha
This is a meta description. This is a description of you're kind of enticing someone to click what the article is about. And so, we need a really good meta description. And so, let's look down. Okay. Meta description. Okay.

[00:17:13.940] - Aisha
Another thing is your alt text. Remember, the rule was in the file image, the alt text. So, here's the file image alt text. So, let's have a look here.

[00:17:25.310] - Aisha
So, let's find out what else I'll click on it.

[00:17:33.010] - Aisha
Okay. This is what you should do. Don't do this. Don't do what I'm doing here, digital nomad Malaysia even though I'm ranking on page one. You should have described the purpose of the image.

[00:17:40.630] - Aisha
We need to help people that are visually impaired, right? Digital nomad, maybe what I should do is an article, a flag about Malaysia and the articles about digital nomad Malaysia. Anyway, I put my keyword in the alternative text. Now, you might be thinking, oh my God, this is so much to remember.

[00:17:59.900] - Aisha
Okay, listen, let's make life easier for ourselves. And what I do is get the Yoast plugin.

[00:18:10.670] - Aisha
It's free. Do not pay, the paid one. I don't pay anything for Yoast because we gonna, you know let's keep things budget baby. So, upload Yoast as a plugin and put your focus keywords in here. And Yoast is so incredible.

[00:18:24.910] - Aisha
It tells you where to put the keyword. So, it says hello, please put it in the meta description, and it tells you all the problems in the thing. It says have you put it in the introduction? Great. Have you mentioned it enough time?

[00:18:36.240] - Aisha
Great. And if this is red, it will tell you. It will tell you, like, for example, this I need to improve, you know but it's still green overall. And so, Yoast suggests an easy way for you to put the keyword in the right place.

[00:18:48.850] - Aisha
Okay. So, remember rule, find a good keyword. You find a keyword, keyset. You put it in the right place in your article. You can use Yoast if you want.

[00:18:57.560] - Aisha
And the third formula. Third part of the formula is, let's have a look. You supercharge it with secondary keyword. Now a lot of people wonder, how is it this girl Aisha, she's you know, she hasn't been around for that long. How is she getting all this traffic?

[00:19:13.820] - Aisha
It's because, and my site doesn't have a high authority, right? I supercharge each piece of content with secondary keywords, which means I don't only rank for one keyword. I don't only rank for digital nomad Malaysia.

[00:19:26.310] - Aisha
I put in secondary keywords within my article. I'm going to show you an example, right? And so, you, first of all, how do you find secondary keywords? Keyword variations are like relevant keywords which are different to this topic. And so, I'm going to show an example.

[00:19:42.580] - Aisha
So, let's just say in keyset, right? Or capsule wardrobe, let's say digital nomad. Digital .. So, here are keyword variations over here. Okay. And so, digital nomad Malaysia is my primary keyword, we need to put those keywords in that place.

[00:20:12.330] - Aisha
Then I supercharge my content and I include digital nomad visa Malaysia. Malaysia digital nomad visa. I include digital nomad community, anything relevant to that. This tool is telling us these are relevant. And so, I include the ones which have you know maybe, that are 30, maybe 40 or less because they're lower competition.

[00:20:35.210] - Aisha
So, I include about 8 to 10. And so. If we look at this content here, I have supercharged... The stuff in yellow, I have supercharged it with alternative keywords, which means that when someone Googles digital Nomad accommodation, this article might come up. Okay. And so, we just supercharged the content with secondary keywords, so we can rank for those optimal keywords.

[00:20:57.090] - Aisha
And it's important for two reasons. One, it means that you can rank for additional keywords. Number two, it means that you are showing to Google what this topic is about. So, you need to put relevant keywords, so variations of the same topic, right, which you can find in keyword research.

[00:21:12.880] - Aisha
And it's saying to Google, this is what this article is about. You become the expert in that topic. And so, honestly, guys and girls, that is the three step formula I have followed for all my sites and all my articles, okay. And that's it, find a good keyword, put the keyword in the right place, supercharge each piece of content with relevant secondary keywords. You got that.

[00:21:33.630] - Aisha
Okay. Now listen, let's talk about bonuses, you know. Let's make this even easier and better for you. So, as a new site, you are probably struggling against other big sites out there that have been around for like so long. Like you know people, they're like, I get like, 100,000 views and I've been around for ten years.

[00:21:55.520] - Aisha
It's like, great. Good for you. But I haven't. So, how am I going to rank? And so, I'm going to teach you how. So, first of all, that was a really terrible American accent.

[00:22:05.610] - Aisha
I'm really sorry. I need to work on my accent. So, what I do for my pieces of content to make it more valuable and rank is I include a frequently asked questions section. Okay. Now I'm going to share an article that I got. This article I'm going to share was the first time I tasted SEO success.

[00:22:24.310] - Aisha
So after failing, failing, failing. When I included this FAQ and followed this three step formula into this article, I started to get Google traffic, significant Google traffic. And so, this is what I did. This particular article here.

[00:22:39.410] - Aisha
Non native English teacher jobs. Okay.

[00:22:47.970] - Aisha
Anyway, my point is I'm on page one. So, if we look here at beyond page one, right, we can see if we scroll to the bottom.

[00:22:59.650] - Aisha
I remember when I first started getting traffic to this. I see traffic. I think I cried. I was like, I think I practice. I finally got it.

[00:23:06.860] - Aisha
And it was so exciting. Okay, FAQ. So, we look here. I put on FAQs, but don't just include any FAQ. Include FAQs that Google tells us to include.

[00:23:18.590] - Aisha
And so, what you do is when you put in that keyword, right? Any topic you want to go for digital nomad Malaysia, I'll put it in this, whatever topic that you're going to try to rank for. Look here at people also ask, this is going to be your FAQ.

[00:23:37.460] - Aisha
Google is telling you people when they are Googling non native English teacher jobs, they are also looking for these topics. So, if you include it in your article, you are way more valuable than your competition chances are. And you are providing value to your reader and they'll stay around for longer.

[00:23:54.260] - Aisha
Okay. And this, if someone stays in your article for longer, it's a sign to Google that the content is good and they will rank you higher. So, as a new blogger please always include a section of, just include a few. You don't have to include all.

[00:24:07.200] - Aisha
Okay. So, in the people also asked section include at the bottom, put FAQ, write some of these questions. Answer them.

[00:24:12.800] - Aisha
Step one. Number two. Another bonus tip for you is article clusters. Now NNETJ is the article, non native English teacher jobs is the article that I have just shared with you.

[00:24:26.400] - Aisha
So, keyword clusters, right, is when you write a variety... No, topics which are within the same niche within the same cluster. So, for example, in this scenario, I wrote non native English teacher jobs, and I found alternative topics about online teaching, about teaching. And I wrote them. I wrote right at least five or six, and you will notice that your traffic will increase, especially as a new site, because as a new site, Google doesn't know what your authority is.

[00:24:54.710] - Aisha
And so, what I do is I write keyword clusters. So, let's just say you want to write about, okay, just now, for example, let's go to capsule wardrobe, right.

[00:25:10.450] - Aisha
And so, if you're a fashion blogger, I'm going to help you here. So, what you need to do is find the keyword cluster. So, I would write if I was a fashion blogger, I would do this, I'll write about.

I'd write capsule wardrobe for men, topic one, winter capsule wardrobe, topic two, spring capsule wardrobe, topic three, minimalist capsule wardrobe, topic four. Honestly, there's so many. I would, plus size, oh my God, this is such a great niche. I would write these articles in a cluster, and it helps because it means your research time is like shortened. Write five or six in a cluster, interlink them.

[00:25:50.480] - Aisha
So, when I wrote about non native English jobs, I link to a relevant article on online teaching, and I linked between them. You create a cluster. And as a new site, if you do that, wow, you are going to notice that you will start to get significant Google traffic because Google trusts you as an authority for that topic. Okay. And so, remember, find a good keyword.

So, if I were you and you were going to leave a session and you want to get Google traffic. Step one, click on the link below and get key search for free for the first month, you got it.

[00:28:30.400] - Aisha
You're sitting there now with an article that has a primary keyword. It has keywords in all the right places and has a second keyword. Now what? Add an FAQ. Have you found the FAQ?

[00:28:40.630] - Aisha
You put it into Google and look at the people also ask section. You got it. Okay, so far, so good. Then what you do is you go back to key search and find a keyword cluster and write five to six articles relevant. They're going to be different but relevant.

[00:28:54.200] - Aisha
And so, capsule wardrobe for men, capsule wardrobe for women, capsule wardrobe for the summer, for the winter, for the fall. Right? Five or six. You got that, and interlink between them?

You click on the link below, put in your email, and then you will immediately get this checklist. You can print out, put it on your wall, and you can like, just every time you write an article, just check it. Check. Check. Check.

[00:30:12.220] - Aisha
Okay. So, it's a simple checklist to help you put all your keywords in the right places and start getting full traffic. But also what I've got here for you is this. I know that a difficult part after this is, okay, so what's a good outline?

[00:30:29.210] - Aisha
How do I, what subheadings? What should I research for my topic? How do I write a piece of content that Google and my readers love? And so, I did create a mini course for you. And basically it train you to write the optimum blog post training.

I mean, where to put the keyword, how to SEO optimize it, and all the stuff I wish people told me. Because I know these experts, they don't share their knowledge.

They don't truly share that. I mean, there's a lot of amazing people on the market. But just stuff that I've come across in my experience, you know I wish someone told me this. It would have made my life a lot easier. And finally, this for me, I think will be pretty useful because I actually give you an over the shoulder audit of a food blog post and a parenting blog post. They've written a blog post.
