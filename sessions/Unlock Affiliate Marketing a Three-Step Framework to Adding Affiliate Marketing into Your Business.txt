Hello, everybody, and welcome to the Unlock Affiliate Marketing Masterclass a three-step framework to adding affiliate marketing into your business. I'm Alex Okell, and I'm really excited to be part of the 2024 Blogger Breakthrough Summit. Let's get started. I am pretty sure that you are one of two people. Either you've never participated in affiliate marketing, and to be honest you're probably a bit confused what it is, how it can fit into your business. Is it the sleasiest thing you've ever heard? How can you do it well? There's a lot of questions. Or maybe you have added some links here and there throughout your business. Maybe you've scattered some into a blog post, but you might be making pennies if anything, and it's more of an afterthought and something that you occasionally remember to do and post your link on your stories, and then not much happens. Which one are you? Whichever one you are this Masterclass is for you. Because I know that this is where you're at right now with your business. You are swapping your time for money, you are relying on one revenue stream, and you are constantly on the hamster wheel of having to create new, free, and paid resources to support your clients.

[00:01:18.840] - Alex
Because maybe you are coaching them in one aspect of life, of business, whatever it is that you coach, they just need a little something else to supplement the work that you are doing. So you're either completely reinventing the wheel and having to create more and more resources, new courses, new freebies, new PDFs, whereas actually there is so much out there that you could be promoting to your current clients, to your audience, to your community which would actually be a much better fit than us trying to be a Jack of all trades. If this is you right now, I feel you because this is where I was at. So this is a little bit about me. Before we get started, I think it's important for you to know who you're learning from. So my name is Alex Okell. I am a nutritionist. I am the founder of the PCOS Collective which is a non-diet PCOS education hub, and I help online business owners make one-to-one optional with expansive product suites and affiliate marketing. And a bit more personal stuff about me, I absolutely love spinning, I love reading, and I love deep diving into pop culture. So, I think it's important for you to know a bit about my business.

[00:02:23.390] - Alex
And I'm going to be talking in this example all about my nutrition business. So I have my two businesses. I have the PCOS Collective and I have alexokell.com which is where you will have found me today. So, a little bit about my business. Before in my nutrition business, I was working one-to-one. I was -- really felt like I was making little impact because I could only work with those people who could afford to work with me. I couldn't scale my income. I was at a point where I didn't want to put up my prices anymore. It didn't feel comfortable. It didn't feel right to expand my prices. I didn't really want to bring in any team members to take on clients for me. It just never was how I saw my business going. I didn't want to be a manager. It just didn't feel good to me. And I had a jam-packed calendar and I was completely burnt out and I went through a really awful period in January 2022 of burnout where I really lost interest in absolutely everything, business and personal. So I was just at the point of, you know, rock bottom. That's really how it felt. And now, I've completely kind of switched up my business model, and I have more income than ever, more time, freedom, and I really feel like I'm making more impact because I'm getting emails and responses from people who are absolutely loving the content that me and my small team of freelancers are creating.

[00:03:39.530] - Alex
And I just feel like I'm making a much bigger impact. And affiliate marketing really has been a key part of this because the way that my business works in terms of my nutrition business is it is a content hub. So we create free content, and then we sell low cost digital products that really, kind of, really nicely supplement the work that we're doing, and we also offer affiliate links throughout our articles. And I love this way of working because I always really felt this resistance. I felt like I had this message that I wanted to get out there. I had this way of working which was this non-diet approach to nutrition which not many people were doing in the PCOS space, and there really wasn't good resources for people with PCOS. So, it always felt like I was just holding it in when I could only work with one-to-one clients. To completely switching this way of working and having now this content hub where people can really purchase through our affiliate links or purchase our low cost digital products has really, really helped. But they also, you know, they can -- they get so much information and content and educational content just from what we're putting up on the site. So it just really, really good and it feels really aligned because I know I'm helping people, and the way that we make our money is through these digital products and affiliate marketing.

[00:04:49.900] - Alex
So, If you are completely brand new to affiliate marketing and you're not sure what affiliate income is and you don't understand how our business makes money through that, then I'm here to tell you all about it. But affiliate income is not a get-rich-quick scheme. It's not an all-or-nothing approach, and it's not sleazy. So let's go back to the start. It's not a get-rich-quick scheme because it really depends on your business model. But you might be an affiliate for a product that is £5. You might be an affiliate for something which is £5,000 and depending on the share that you get, which is usually between one and 50 percent, you could be -- it could be a get-rich-quick scheme for you if you sign up to the -- my affiliate program, sure. But for most people, they are not be able to find a product that's aligned with their community which is a massively high top ticket product. And they also don't necessarily have the traffic in place or the community in place to come sell to quote unquote. So, it is something that builds up over time, but if you can put your strategy in place now, then that means that over the next few months and years, you will continue to be bringing in affiliate income and it will really nicely stack.

[00:05:53.990] - Alex
And whilst your business grows, your affiliate income will also grow. It's also not an all or nothing approach. So many people think that this means they need to go out and create a really niche website, build their traffic with SEO and sell really something really niche like having a running trainer comparison site. That is always like a really big example that seems to be on the Internet. And you, of course, can do that but I really love teaching people ways that they can bring in affiliate income into their existing business. So, this is not like a whole new project you have to start. We can look at ways that we can bring affiliate income into your business right now, and we can also think about how long term we can strategize to make sure affiliate income is part of your overall business strategy. It's also not sleazy. Of course, like absolutely anything in business affiliate marketing can be sleazy. People can sell in a sleazy way. People can market in a sleazy way. People can do literally anything in business in a sleazy way, and affiliate income is definitely, you know, can -- can be done sleazily. But I teach it in a way where you are completely honest with the disclaimers so people understand how you make your income that an affiliate link is involved.

[00:07:04.810] - Alex
You are not promoting just to promote just because you want that juicy, juicy 50 percent, you know, cut of the product. It's because you genuinely think this product or service will be able to support your clients or community to, you know, grow and expand in whatever way that you support them. So, in fact, affiliate income is a way to diversify your revenue which I'm a huge fan of. It really is the, I think, key for 2023 to diversify your revenue. After the last few years, we've seen with the pandemic, with the cost of living crisis, all of these things that are going on in the world, we -- the war in Ukraine, we can just see how these huge world events can really shake us and shake our businesses. So, it's important that we diversify our revenue streams so that if anything happens, if we need to take time off unexpectedly or expectedly, that our business is still ticking along nicely and bringing in income. We also -- it's also a great way to make money for products or services that you're already recommending. I know that as you go through your daily life, in your business, and in your -- in your personal life as well, you will be constantly recommending products or services.

[00:08:12.460] - Alex
Well, why not get a little kickback for those things you were already promoting? It's also a way to serve your audience so they get their best results. Like I mentioned earlier, if you are already offering a service to someone, for example, say you are a business coach and you support someone on how they can, you know, get to the next, you know, 5K of revenue in their month, so they're looking at how they can expand their client portfolio, for example, well there's various ways that they can do that, but maybe one way you're talking about is email marketing. Okay, great. So, they're going to need an email marketing service. Okay. Well, you have various options that's free to being super expensive. Which one do you recommend? Which one is the best one that would actually support your clients to get those results that you have promised? These are just a few easy ways you can kind of see how affiliate marketing is actually beneficial for your audience as well. I also really love the example of I promote various different programs to my one-to-one clients in my business, strategy business, and that's because I know I am not the best at everything. I am not the best at creating courses, so I have someone who I recommend who I get a cut of if the successful recommendations.

[00:09:27.980] - Alex
I have an SEO course that I recommend because even though I'm pretty damn good at SEO the technical side of SEO I find difficult to teach. So, I'm going to send you to the best person, and that is when I really think that we create the best client experiences because we're happy to say, actually, there's someone who does this better than me. The online space feels like it's a bit cannibalized. I feel like we're all just stepping on each other's toes trying to expand our product suite to the point of where we're really just covering anything and everything to try and reach everyone. Whereas actually, when you're really bloody good at what you do, you are not scared to pass on the baton and say, actually, this person will be really good and really support you with this. And the way that we can do that with absolute ease and certainty and in a state of complete relaxation is if we are making affiliate income from those recommendations. So, to put it really simply, affiliate marketing is a marketing scheme in which a company compensates partners for business created from the affiliate's marketing tactic. So, just to put it simply, really is businesses, from small businesses like myself, which is really just a company of one with some freelancers -- I have an affiliate scheme.

[00:10:35.640] - Alex
Then we have companies like Amazon, you know, one of the biggest companies in the world also have an affiliate scheme. So it really does go from the smallest businesses to the biggest businesses often have affiliate schemes and this is just a way for them to reach more people. They know that if they get -- if they offer an affiliate scheme, people are more willing to promote their item, product, service, whatever it is. And it's just a really, really great way to kind of, like I said, pass on the baton to the right person so that people can really get the results that they're looking for. If you're someone who doesn't -- who's thinking, how the hell am I going to be able to promote a course or a service it doesn't make sense in my business, for example, let's think about a dog groomer. So you might not necessarily be promoting a course or a service. I mean, one thing you could recommend is you could team up with a behavioral expert who would -- who's a dog trainer, you know something like that, and you could get commission if you refer people on. But in terms of products as well, it's things like you can recommend dog grooming brushes. You can recommend different types of food if their coats' looking a bit dry, you know, all of these different things.

[00:11:40.960] - Alex
We're just kind of thinking outside the box and realizing how much in our everyday life we do actually recommend. So to put it simply, you really just receive a financial reward between one and 50 percent of the product or service price if someone purchases a product using your unique link. And this is what's key because the way that affiliate marketing works is that you will receive a unique URL which is linked back to you. And when someone clicks that link and buys through it in a certain amount of time, so for Amazon it's only 24 hours, but other affiliate schemes I've been in it's maybe 90 days, 30 days, six months it really depends and you'll see it as you apply to different programs, if someone buys within that time, then you will be credited and they will give you your cut, your percentage. It really is that simple. This is a question I get all the time. So who can actually do affiliate marketing? And the short answer truly is anyone who has a business, whether you're a blogger, a service provider, a coach, an influencer, a content creator, if you have any form of community or you're building a community via social media, a podcast, an email list, or if you have decent website traffic, you can invite affiliate income into your business, and it's really, really exciting.

[00:12:59.140] - Alex
When we get started into our kind of affiliate marketing strategy, my three-step framework, I just want to go through three mistakes that you might be making with your affiliate marketing if you've already started, or three things that you will want to avoid. The first one, of course, is not being compliant, and this is something that I see all the time. If you are not putting a disclaimer that something is an affiliate link anywhere and everywhere, whether you're sending, you know, product recommendation via email -- via, via email, you know like a mass email, like an email newsletter, on Instagram stories, in Instagram DMs, in blog posts, et cetera, et cetera, you have to be compliant. Certain affiliate schemes will have their own way of wording that they will want you to follow. But for the majority, it's just being really, really clear with your disclaimer saying, just so you know, this is an affiliate link. This means that you will -- that I receive a small amount of commission if you do purchase through my link with -- at no extra cost to you. I think that part is really key because I think people, if they are not familiar with affiliate marketing, might see that and think that you are charging a premium to go through your link, but you are not.

[00:14:08.340] - Alex
You are just getting a small commission if they decide to go through your link. Setting and forgetting is another key mistake of affiliate marketing. Like with any marketing strategy, it only really works if you are tracking the metrics, seeing what's working, making adjustments accordingly, and you know, seeing what works and seeing what doesn't work. To put it completely simply, is just to see what works. See what doesn't work. Make changes. Test it. Work through kind of those motions again and again, month on month, year on year, see what works, and It can be just an amazing way to bring in extra revenue into your business. But also, so many people just put it in, forget about it, lose their links, lose their login codes, don't know what's going on, make a few pennies, and just think this isn't working for me. There is a strategy that we can follow here. This isn't just a set and forget thing to do. Even though affiliate marketing is really easy, and once you have grasped it, it can be something that really does make you money while you sleep, while you're on holiday, et cetera, et cetera. We do need to have a strategy in place, like with anything in business.

[00:15:10.340] - Alex
And the final mistake you might be making or want to avoid is being inauthentic. So it can feel kind of exciting and thinking, okay, well this affiliate scheme pays 50 percent so I really want to promote this. But is it relevant to your audience? Is it something that you've actually used or would use? Because that's another thing [inaudible 00:15:28]. In our -- my nutrition business, I will recommend a supplement that I wouldn't necessarily take because it's not relevant to me. I write content about the people who are pregnant, for example. Well, I'm not pregnant. I've never been pregnant, so I wouldn't necessarily take those supplements. But I have done my research and I understand the product and I align with the business, et cetera, et cetera, and that's what this aligned affiliate marketing strategy is all about. It is not a get-rich-quick scheme. It's not a you know, sleazy way to do business. It really is adding an exciting, amazing, new revenue stream to your business in an aligned way that it makes sense for you and makes sense for your customers. So, how do you actually find these aligned affiliate opportunities? So this our step one in our three-step framework. So affiliate marketing can be sleazy like anything in business.

[00:16:16.890] - Alex
So like I've said, always recommend products you've used yourself or would use. Do your research and disclose. When we lead with value, our affiliate links should be secondary. So, it's not necessarily like we're going in and we're just thinking, okay, how can I get this affiliate link in and I will shoehorn it into anywhere, even if it doesn't fit. All of our content should be leading with value. If you are someone who creates articles for your website, you will already know that if you lead with value, Google rewards you. They want to put the people who are creating the absolute best content online at the top of their Google search. Instagram it's exactly the same thing. Tiktok, what is leading with value? What is entertaining? What is educational? What's informative for your audience? Lead with that and then affiliate links can come secondary. Always lead with them -- value, sorry, and never just because you like the look of the commission. So, there's one way to kind of think about this is to start by thinking what products or services are you already recommending. If you're someone who helps people create courses, you might be thinking, well, I recommend Teachable and Kajabi, so I'm going to go in and see if they have an affiliate program.

[00:17:23.200] - Alex
Hint, they both do. What recommendations do people ask from you? So someone might be saying, if you're a dog groomer, well what [inaudible 00:17:30] you're using so that I could do this in between sessions? There you go. There's one thing that you can already do. What products or services would complement the work you already do? So this is similar to the example I was using before. Let me do a different one. So say, for example, you are a personal trainer and you know that people come in and you are not qualified to do sports massage -- we know some people come in complaining that they've got some niggles. Could you join up with a physiotherapist or a sports masseuse and promote their products? You know, these are all ways that we can go about this. Could you look at foam rollers? Could you look at, you know, those massage guns? You know, there's so many different ways that we can think about this. And it's just taking some time and maybe getting a big piece of paper or getting a Notion board going, and just brainstorming all of those different things that you already recommend in your business, what people ask from you, and what would complement your work.

[00:18:22.110] - Alex
And the really overarching thing here is what products or services would help your ideal client save time, save money, and/or achieve their goals, and you can kind of cross out what's not relevant here to you and your business. But for most people, their aim really for anything they're purchasing is because they want to either save time, save money, or achieve their goals, or it might be a combination. So just go back to that and that can be kind of your north star. What is going on here? What would actually help my client? And then we have different types of affiliate programs that you can join. So, I split it into three because I really do think Amazon Associates is its own beast. It's almost like a marketplace because of the way that Amazon does that business and how they run their business. They are such a huge marketplace that sells products from them via Amazon and also via individual businesses. So, Amazon Associates is a huge one, but their affiliates is incredibly low and also you might not feel aligned to Amazon and their way of doing business, so this might not be suitable for you. We also have affiliate networks. So this is more for businesses that you may think of like ASOS, M&S, John Lewis, those sort of businesses, H&M, they have -- they all kind of partner with these affiliate networks and you can join them.

[00:19:35.890] - Alex
Well, you often just going to have to say who you are, what you do, pop in like your website or your Instagram and show how you are going to actually promote the product. And you are likely to kind of go through a little bit of like a validation phase where they will just check you out and just make sure that you are not going against any of their guidelines like promoting violence or something like that. So there's a little bit of work to be done there, but it's not too difficult and they are generally quite generous with who they accept. And we also have direct, so this might be something like the example I've put here is Kajabi. But this tends to be kind of standalone smaller businesses and not necessarily small businesses but kind of smaller. A lot of the tech platforms do it this way where they have their own affiliate program. Or another good example is like supplement companies often have their own, and then the bigger supplement companies are usually within the affiliate networks. So, you just might have to kind of like route around. But usually if you just go to someone's website for a product that you want to promote or a service you want to promote and scroll down to the bottom, they usually do have a section on their affiliate program and you can figure out how they -- how they do their program

[00:20:39.550] - Alex
is it via a network or is it direct. And you can also pitch to businesses that don't have affiliate schemes. I'm not going to go into that today because that is a much more in-depth way of doing things, but that is definitely possible. So it's really exciting because there are so many different ways that you can become an affiliate for businesses and companies that you love. And now, we are signed up. We have our code. So when you have signed up to somewhere you've been approved, you will be given unique URLs which are linked via cookies to you and your website. So they're aligned with you, and you are able to start placing them. So I like to split affiliate marketing into two different buckets. So, we have our primary affiliates and we have our secondary affiliates. And for me, primary affiliates' articles tend to convert extremely well, and this is because the consumer is at the end of their buying journey. This is really when the article, the piece of content, the video, the podcast, literally whatever it is, is completely focused on that affiliate product. So, if we go back to the business owner who helps people create courses, this might be a PDF that says, Kajabi versus Teachable, which should you use?

[00:21:54.130] - Alex
And it's like the pros, the cons, the cost, you know, everything is on there, and then it has the two affiliate links so people can make their decision. So, this works really well for reviews versus content, like I mentioned case studies saying in my experience using Flodesk or my experience with this type of supplement, whatever it is. You can also do interviews. So maybe you might interview the founder of a company, or you might do an interview with someone who's also used that product or service. That can be a really great way to create primary affiliate content. It might be how-to guides or training videos where you kind of coach someone through how they actually use a service or a product. It might be mini reviews on social media. Another way that it converts really well is a sales page. So, for example, if you know that there is a product that you -- a product or service that you just absolutely love, you're recommending all the time, you are really going to be using as your kind of -- as a primary way of creating income, then a sales page can work really well. So you might actually create a sales page as if it's your product, obviously saying that it's not your product, it's an affiliate link but creating a whole sales page.

[00:23:00.890] - Alex
Secondary affiliate marketing is really things like when you kind of weave the affiliate's links into content you would already be creating, for example, articles for your SEO for people to find you online, resources pages. So resource page is something like all the tools I use in my business onboarding and offboarding documents for new clients within courses, within PDFs and e-books, and another FAQ on a sales page, listicles, roundups, gift buys, thank you pages, and then just like in conversations like on Instagram DM or on Zoom, or in person, you know, just having those conversations with people. Okay. And then we have stage three, and this is really what I was talking about earlier when I was saying about not setting and forgetting. This is how we track and optimize our affiliate marketing so that it actually fits in really well with our business. It's actually making sense for the time we're putting in, and we can see what's working and what's not, and we can make adjustments accordingly. So track. We want to curate an affiliate marketing tracker which I give you free if you join my course. We also have an up -- you need to update that metrics tracker on a monthly basis and audit any broken links.

[00:24:06.330] - Alex
I actually had this happen to me recently when a affiliate program changed the way that they were doing links and I didn't realize and all of my links were broken for about three weeks, and I should have noticed because it was one of my bigger affiliate products. But then I ended up discovering it and I audited it and I changed the links and I fixed it. But it was one of those things where I have definitely lost income from just not being aware of broken links. So, using a broken link checker is really great for that. You also want to be tracking to keep aware of new programs that you can join because ideally we do want to be off Amazon for various reasons. But one of the main things is just the affiliate commission that it gives is just not very high. It's not very competitive. So if, for example, a product that we usually put on Amazon, they decide to create their own affiliate program, then we can go directly there instead which can be great. And then from this we can optimize. We identify the issue. Why is this not working? So it might be something as simple as, oh the link is broken, you know, something like that -- that happened to me.

[00:25:07.090] - Alex
But also sometimes you'll just create something maybe a primary piece of content or a secondary piece of content that's just not working quite so well. So, let's optimize it. Let's see what's going wrong. And we can identify the issue and it's usually three things. Is there low traffic? Is there not enough people finding that piece of content? Whether it's a podcast, an article, a YouTube video, whatever it is, is it a low click-through rate? Are people reading the piece of content but not clicking through to find out more? What's the problem there? Or is it a low conversion rate? People are clicking through but they are not converting. Once we have seen what the problem is, once we've identified the issue, then we can take some time to optimize. Thank you so much for watching this training.
