Kate Kordsmeier [00:00:12]:
Hello. Hello, everybody. I am super excited to share what is working now in my business to make daily sales without social media. And, yeah, I'm gonna go ahead and share my screen first. So hi. I am Kate Kordsmeier, your anti guru in business coaching. I'm gonna give you my quick bio here. Essentially, what you need to know about me is that I'm a mom of 2 managing OCD, chronic illness, and running a business that's pulled over 2 and a half million all while working less than 20 hours a week.

Kate Kordsmeier [00:00:50]:
I launched my wellness blog, Bruton Revel, back in 2015, and I hit my first 6 figure year by 2018 and making over a $193,000 while on my 2 maternity leaves. And then I turned around and sold my blog from multiple 6 figures in 2021. In 2019, I actually launched Success with Soul, which is my business that I still run today. And I actually went without social media. Yeah. I quit all social media in 2021 and my business grew a 165% that next year. I've now worked with over 1200 clients and counting. I'm a certified life and business coach.

Kate Kordsmeier [00:01:32]:
I've got a woo woo twist. I've got certifications in NLP and hypnotherapy and Reiki. And Success with Soul is really my rebellion against the patriarchy. I my mission is to arm more wonderful humans with fatter wallets and shorter to do lists. So let's get into it. Okay. Today, we're diving into how introverted course creators and bloggers can harness their natural strength to develop sustainable automated daily sales without social media. Okay.

Kate Kordsmeier [00:02:03]:
So I know many of

Kate Kordsmeier [00:02:04]:
you are here today because you're a blogger who is probably looking for more ways to grow your audience and monetize with new revenue streams. And maybe some of you

Kate Kordsmeier [00:02:13]:
are here today because you're a coach or

Kate Kordsmeier [00:02:15]:
a course creator who wants to grow their traffic organically without social media and maybe even without paid ads. And I know that for a long time, it was really either or. You were either a blogger or a course creator. But, actually, you're most successful when you bring the 2 together. No selfies required unless you actually feel like it. And so we're gonna get into what this really means and

Kate Kordsmeier [00:02:40]:
what it looks like today. And it all kind of starts with your funnel. So blogging is your ultimate top of funnel.

Kate Kordsmeier [00:02:49]:
Someone gets to your site by finding your blog posts, and then you get

Kate Kordsmeier [00:02:52]:
them to opt into your email list through a lead magnet or a freebie, or even just a form that says opt in for, you know, to get emails from me. And we're gonna look at what the back end of that funnel looks like after you've gotten them onto your email list. So it all starts with the back end, which is your automated sales funnel. So the very top of your funnel starts with a lead magnet. Right? This is a valuable freebie that addresses your audience's needs, and you can optimize it for SEO. And this funnel incorporate a low cost tripwire offer to convert those subscribers into customers right away. So here is your top of funnel. It's a lead magnet or some kind of list opt in with a tripwire.

Kate Kordsmeier [00:03:40]:
The next step of your funnel is automated welcome sequence. Here, we're gonna use authentic story driven content to build trust and seamlessly start introducing your offers to new subscribers. So this is a series that is completely automated. When somebody joins your list, you start mailing them, and you might have anywhere from 3 to 30 emails in this. Start wherever you are. You can start small. But in this, you're introducing them to who you are, what you're about, who you help, how you help them, and you're starting to make actual offers. So, yes, there are going to be some sales emails in your welcome series.

Kate Kordsmeier [00:04:19]:
The next step of the funnel is more offers with trip wires, bumps, and upsells. So here is where we're going to leverage the quiet power automation to implement strategic sales tactics while focusing on bringing engaging content. So we're gonna go into exactly what this looks like in just a minute, but for now, just know that all of your offers should have some kind of trip wire or pop offer on it, meaning that there is a limited time window, like maybe 15 minutes where they can get a special discount and when they check out their bumps and upsells in order to increase the average order value. The next and last step of this automated sales funnel is an automated evergreen email series. So we already had the welcome series when somebody first joins your list. But after they've been on your list for a while, the way that we continue to have a sustainable low maintenance sales system working for us is by creating a series of emails that goes out potentially for as long as an entire year, and it can continue to nurture your audience and drive sales without the need for that constant high energy interaction. So using this system has allowed me to quit live launching altogether to still make well over 6 figures with my business, working less than 20 hours a week without social media every and making daily sales. Yes.

Kate Kordsmeier [00:05:55]:
Seriously, I make sales every single day of my offers anywhere from $7 all the way up to $2,000 and everywhere in between, And I'm able to do this by having these email series. So, for example, one of my email series is called Friyay. And on Fridays, every single Friday, they get an email from me. It's all automated with a special discount code and an offer on one of my products. So after I set this up once, I don't have to continue being actively selling every single day, but I am able to continue making sales every single day, especially on Fridays, which are big sales days for me, with this series. And so I started just with 3 emails in this to get me going, and then I tried to add one email a week, basically, until I got to a place where I felt like this was good. At the end of this series, I have my tech set up so that they just pop right back into the start and they go through it all again. This allows me to know that I'm making at least one offer a week to my audience without having to actively show up live and do anything.

Kate Kordsmeier [00:07:08]:
Perfect for my introverted self. Okay. So next, just kinda wanna dig a little bit deeper into the lead magnet, opt in with a tripwire. So once this is set up, a well crafted tripwire can generate sales automatically, leveraging your thoughtful approach to create offers that resonate deeply with your audience. And this is a really simple yet powerful strategy that allows you to monetize your efforts efficiently, providing a steady stream of income with very minimal ongoing effort. I think this is so great for introverts because one of our strengths is that we can spend a lot of time in deep, thoughtful work. So you can do that to create a valuable lead magnet and then setting up the tech. And by optimizing the lead magnet's landing page with SEO keywords, you can actually even attract organic traffic to build your list effectively.

Kate Kordsmeier [00:08:04]:
Now putting a tripwire on the end of this is key because tripwires are a perfect match for introverts. They work quietly in the background, convert those leads into customers without the need for constant interaction. Okay. Next up is your automated welcome series. So, again, in this series, you're gonna want to make sure that you're weaving in authentic storytelling, telling your unique story sharing your specific journey because that authenticity resonates and builds trust with your audience. So as you start making offers, they've already got know, like, and trust with you. And when you seamlessly integrate your offers into these automated email sequences, you can really guide your subscribers through a very thoughtful and personalized journey, leading them to your products and services at the right time without overwhelming them. I'd also say that this is a great tool for introverts because you can leverage your natural strength of why introspection to deeply understand your audience's pain points.

Kate Kordsmeier [00:09:07]:
And then you can address these thoughtfully in your welcome in your welcome sequence. And finally, just to reiterate, you can seamlessly integrate your offers within these series. Even if you're just starting out with a PS, about some of your sales, about some of your products, that's a great way to get started. I also have an email in my welcome series that guides my new subscribers to either my online shop or my everything page, if you're familiar with Lizzie Goddard's everything page concept. Basically, just having a page on your site or having a shop, like I have a Shopify store as well. These are great ways to just, like, send an email letting them know that this exists, and they can peruse what kinds of things that you offer and how you might be able to help them. Okay. So I promised we were gonna look into tripwires, bumps, and upsells a little more.

Kate Kordsmeier [00:10:00]:
So here's what the tripwire funnel really looks like. So we already talked about it when you have a lead magnet as your opt in, but if you actually have, you can do a trip wire or sometimes it's called a pop offer on a sales page as well. So on that sales page, you might have a little pop up or a banner or something like that that's got a countdown timer. I recommend no more than 15 minutes. And then on that countdown time, you're going to offer them something for a limited time. Right? So you might say something like get 50% off this course for the next 15 minutes, and you'll either give them a coupon code or depending on what your tech stack is, just you'll send them to the checkout page where that price is listed. So they get to the checkout page, and on the checkout page, you'll add something that's called a bump offer. This is, like, on you've probably seen these before.

Kate Kordsmeier [00:11:01]:
So this is where pull it up. There's, like, a little box on the checkout page to add something. Usually, it's either a checkbox or a toggle button or something like that, And it's usually for a low cost offer, usually somewhere between maybe 7 to $50. And there's no hard and fast rule. It's your business. You can do it however you want, but that's sort of best practice. And this really helps you increase your average order value by giving them an irresistible offer that they can add on to whatever else they're buying. You want it to be something complimentary without being confusing.

Kate Kordsmeier [00:11:40]:
You don't want it to be too similar to what you're offering. But thinking about who the person is buying your original offer and what else that person might also be interested in. And then after they check out, if you use a tool like Kartra or Thrivecart or Kajabi, all of these tools, my favorite is Kartra, have one click upsell option. So they don't have to input their payment information again. They simply get to the checkout page. They either choose to add the bump offer or not, and after they check out, this is almost like a replacement for the thank you page, and it's going to ask them if they want to add on one more thing to their order. And this the upsell, you can go a lot higher in your price point. You don't have to.

Kate Kordsmeier [00:12:27]:
All different kinds of things work, but upsells are great places to add on things like coaching or any kind of one on one offer, or maybe it's a larger course that you offer or a way for them to upgrade their order. So if you have all of these in place, then you are going to increase your average order value without lifting a finger, except for the initial set of this. So I now have this on every single one of my products. And I can't tell you how well things convert when somebody is already ready to buy from you. Getting them to add a couple more things is actually quite easy. So after the ones like upsell, there's an option to bring them to a downsell page. If they perhaps didn't take you up on the upsell or you can simply send them to the full thank you page at the end. All right.

Kate Kordsmeier [00:13:18]:
So part 2 is the front end. So we already looked at the back end with all the tech and systems that I just shared. The front end now is how we actually drive traffic to your sales funnel without social media. You've got your sales funnel here in the center. One of the first strategies I like to go to is guest podcasting and blogging. Appearing in other people's podcasts or writing guest posts really allows you to share your insights deeply, connecting with new audiences in a meaningful way. Perfect for introverts. Number 2 is SEO.

Kate Kordsmeier [00:13:53]:
Well, SEO stands for search engine optimization and SEO is traditionally thought of as blogging or written content, but it can also include YouTube, Pinterest, podcasting, and traditional blogs. So I think introvert's attention to detail and analytical skills make them great at SEO and you can use keyword research to attract organic traffic to your content without having to start social media. And you can really create blog posts and videos and podcast episodes that reflect your unique voice and expertise. Right up next is ads. So even though you might not be posting on social media, you can do ads through Google, Facebook, Instagram, Pinterest, etcetera. And you can use those targeted ads to drive traffic to your freebies, to low ticket offers. This method is obviously pretty effective and doesn't require constant personal interaction, which is why it feels very different to me than actually posting on social media. Okay.

Kate Kordsmeier [00:14:57]:
Bundles and summits. Like the one I'm giving this presentation in, bundles and summits are a great way to reach new audiences through collaboration, leveraging collective visibility without constant engagement. It has been one of the best and fastest ways I have grown my email list without ever having to post on social media. Okay. PR and media features. So if you can secure media features like being interviewed or written about, or even guest writing, for magazines, newspapers, big websites. These can all boost your visibility and your credibility and drive traffic without that need for constant presence. And then finally affiliate and collaboration.

Kate Kordsmeier [00:15:42]:
So affiliates, if you can collaborate with affiliates to promote your, freebies, your offers, you can borrow their audience to grow yours, expanding your reach without that kind of direct content daily effort. This has been one of my favorite ways to collaborate, network, make friends in a way that works for my introverted personality. Okay. One of the last things that I'll share about what's working now is the static 9 grid on Instagram. So y'all probably have, seen, I mentioned already, I quit Instagram in 2021. I haven't posted except one time since then, which was to update my 9 grid, which I did this summer. And this has been an amazing way to still maintain a presence on Instagram so that if somebody goes to search for me and wants to see, is this person legit? What's what are they about? I wanna how many followers did they have? Whoever knows what people are looking for, that they can see I'm a real person. This is how I can help you, but I'm not on social media.

Kate Kordsmeier [00:16:41]:
And so you can't find me here. Come find me over over in these other places. It's been a huge game changer for my business. And what I just wanna add to this is that I really think that logging off social media might be your key to actually scaling up. And when you really look at it, the ROI of social media just doesn't justify the time spent. Marketers spend 16 hours a week on routine tasks like managing social media, which is over 2 whole workdays. But HubSpot actually found that only 14% of those marketers can attribute a direct ROI to their efforts. So the math just doesn't add up.

Kate Kordsmeier [00:17:21]:
So I encourage you to track your own ROI if you're curious. How many sales, how much money can you actually attribute to social and compare that to something like your email list. Not to mention the psychological cost of social media, so because somebody especially who already struggles with depression and anxiety, I just have to share this as well, we all know that limiting social media I should say this, but we all know that social media can make us more depressed, more anxious, more lonely, causes a lot of mental health problems. And if you think about mental health as an asset in your business, which I definitely do, social media just starts to look so much less appealing. So I really think that one of the things that could be keeping you stuck is spending time on social media. When you leave, social media brings you maximized focus and productivity, quality over quantity and networking, improve mental health and decision making, ownership of your audience and your platform and your content, and you can create in-depth, long form, sustainable, long shelf life, evergreen content that can work for you for years. So I highly recommend giving yourself a shot with giving up social media. This is one of our other clients, Christina.

Kate Kordsmeier [00:18:36]:
She said, since since I started working with Kate, I went from making $400 a month to now around $2,500 a month with no social presence. I hate Instagram. So it is not just me. I'm not a fluke. It's not because I had some huge audience before I quit. You can do this too from day 1. I promise you.

Kate Kordsmeier [00:18:56]:
Okay. So what else is working now? We talked about some of the back end of the funnel. We talked about some of the front end

Kate Kordsmeier [00:19:03]:
of the funnel. And now I actually wanna talk about what

Kate Kordsmeier [00:19:05]:
you're selling in the funnel.

Kate Kordsmeier [00:19:06]:
I went from selling one kind of mid tier course to then selling one high ticket group coaching program, and that was all I sold. All roads led there. And then in 2023, what I did is I took my premium program, and I created I evolved into what we're calling, like, an all access pass. And so when you joined Mindful Business Academy, which is what we call our all access pass, you get everything all in one place. So it's not like Mindful Business Academy isn't a course itself. Mindful Business Academy brings together all of our top tier programs and content into one cohesive upgraded experience. So every single course that we sell in the shop, there's a screenshot here showing an example of, like, here's, I think, 6 of the courses that we have in our shop. They're all included in Mindful Business Academy.

Kate Kordsmeier [00:20:01]:
So it's every single course, every single strategy funnel template training you need, and we're so you're not piecing together random tactics. MBA is a fully integrated system that includes everything I sell all in one powerful, all inclusive package, and best part is it's for one unbeatable price. So if you were to buy all of the pieces a la carte in my shop, you would spend a lot more money than you would if you just buy the all access pass to everything. So it's a discounted, almost like bundle, so to speak. The reason I share this is because breaking it up this way has been really powerful for my business. It's allowed people who want everything in one place, who know they want lots of different courses of mine, who want to go all in. They can do that for a fraction of the price. But for those other people who maybe aren't quite there yet, maybe they feel like, actually, I really just need to work on SEO right now.

Kate Kordsmeier [00:20:58]:
I don't need all the other pieces. They can just go to the shop and buy whatever they want a la carte, whether that's a mini course or a template or a training. We sell we basically just broke out lots of different pieces of the Mindful Business Academy and now sell them a la carte. So we're really able to meet people where they're at. We have a way that we're able to sell every single day, making daily sales, whether it's for a $9 course or a $200 course or a Mindful Business Academy sale that's normally priced at $2,000. And so this has been a really powerful way to set up kind of our business structure and our offer suite in a way that works for both me and for our people. The great thing about this too is it might look like, oh my gosh. How did you launch 50 products in the shop in 1 year? Well, I didn't.

Kate Kordsmeier [00:21:49]:
All of these products were already created. So what happened was I was listening to Monica Froese talk about creating a Shopify store, and she was saying how she had all of this content that she had created in various courses and programs over the last 5, 10 years, but it was all gatekept behind this high ticket price. And she felt, man, I can know that there's so much in here that could really help people, but if they're not willing to go all in and spend a couple $1,000, they can't get any of it. And so she just repurposed different pieces of her programs into shop products, and that's exactly what I did. I ended up taking her program actually and how to do a Shopify store and break things apart, but it was a really simple process. And one of the reasons I wanna share it with y'all today is because I bet there are at least a handful of y'all here who have a similar experience. You have a course. You have something that you've created over the years, and what could you take out of that and sell a stand alone a la carte option that helps people get a taste of what it's like to work with you, get some quick wins, and then potentially join your hard ticket program.

Kate Kordsmeier [00:23:01]:
Okay. So in summary, this funnel is a very low energy, high impact system. This funnel allows for really results oriented engagement without draining your energy. And there's a focus on deep work, we think is a huge strength of ours to create high quality content and those automated sequences and the tech and systems that are happening in the back end. Obviously, it's very sustainable and scalable because once you set it up, this funnel just runs on autopilot, ensuring sustainable growth with minimal ongoing effort. And I think it really focuses on authentic connection and genuine relationships, writing through those well crafted introspective content that you produce and resonates really deeply with your audience. So what feels better to you? Here is a little chart that I created here, where we have your return on investment. So how much does it actually work to get you clients and the energy required? You'll see what I consider to be one of the worst ways to market your business is constant social media.

Kate Kordsmeier [00:24:06]:
It's a lot of energy, both in terms of time, commitment and thought and wondering, what am I gonna post? How am I gonna post? Should be a post? All of those types of things. Right? So it's constant daily work and it has a very little ROI. The people I know that are getting any kind of ROI are constantly posting multiple stories, reels, etcetera, per day. And I don't know about you, but as an introvert, especially I have no interest in being glued to my phone all day. Likewise, live launching is another one. Now live launching does have a general pretty good return on investment when you do it. Right. However, it requires a lot of energy, right? So these are kind of two ends of the high energy spectrum.

Kate Kordsmeier [00:24:55]:
Whereas on the flip side, something that requires literally no ongoing energy from you are things like trip wires and upsells and evergreen email sequences. And they have a very high return on investment. Again, some of the other things we talked about. Bundles at summits, affiliate collaborations, SEO, PR and media features. These kind of fall over here in the high return on investment and lower energy required. Whereas some things in the middle, like personalized outreach, live webinars and sales pitches, constant networking events definitely require a lot more energy. So which one feels better to you? This system or this system? I personally want low energy, high impact strategies. And just when you compare it to the traditional high energy sales tactics, oh, it's just exhausting for introverts.

Kate Kordsmeier [00:25:53]:
So in contrast, this funnel really allows for thoughtful pre planned engagement that leverages our strength and reduces the need for constant live interaction.

Kate Kordsmeier [00:26:05]:
So there you have it. That is how to make daily sales without social media, even if you are an introvert. I hope you enjoyed this presentation.
