Jeannette Spencer [00:00:00]:
Hi, Hi, everyone. My name is Jeannette and I'm the founder of the Women's Entrepreneurial Network and I'm super excited to be here with you all today. So I'm literally just gonna jump straight into this workshop. So I firstly wanna start by taking you back a few years to a time when I was kind of in the early stages of building my own blog and business. So back then, I did have a relatively decent amount of traffic flowing through my website. People were reading my content and people were engaging and even sharing it which was amazing, but when it actually came to turn in those readers into customers, there was a huge disconnect. So I was spending a lot of time crafting what I thought were high value blog posts hoping that they would turn it into leads and sales, but what I noticed is the moment that I would include some kind of offer or make some kind of pitch, I start to feel really uncomfortable. And this was mainly because I was scared about coming across too salesy or that somehow I was kind of undermining the trust that I was building with my audience.

Jeannette Spencer [00:01:17]:
And this is a struggle that I know a lot of entrepreneurs generally have. You know, we wanna serve our readers. We wanna serve our customers. We wanna share stories and we wanna provide value because those are pretty much the heartbeats of why most of us start blogging in the first place, but at the same time, we're business owners and part of that process is to grow our businesses and actually make money. Right? This was the dilemma that I was stuck in for so so long. You know, I wanted to create an income from my blog but I didn't know how to kind of make that transition without it feeling forced or transactional. For so many of us, our blog start as a passion project or a creative outlet, but then as they grow and as our traffic and reach grows, they have the potential to become really powerful engines for our business. And when we actually start viewing our blogs not just as a place where we can share content but as a strategic piece of our overall business strategy, we can really start to see what's possible.

Jeannette Spencer [00:02:25]:
Now to be able to create an active revenue stream, you kinda need to think of your blog as more than just a place to share your thoughts. You need to think of your blog as the first stage of a journey that you're inviting your readers to join which is potentially gonna bring them from being casual readers to actually engaging and ultimately becoming loyal customers of yours. And the journey is made possible through something that's called a sales funnel. Now for those of you who don't know, a sales funnel at its core is simply a way of kind of guiding your audience from discovering your content to them ultimately seeing the value that you're able to provide with your offers. Whatever that might be, it could be anything. You know, your funnel doesn't feel salesy or it shouldn't feel salesy or pushy. What it should be is helpful and it should feel purposeful and most importantly, it should feel natural. So during this session, I'm gonna be diving into how to build a blog based sales funnel that really does start to feel natural.

Jeannette Spencer [00:03:28]:
And this includes how to structure your blog content in a way that doesn't inform, but that also engages and encourages your readers to take the next step, How to move readers through your journey that feels aligned with your mission and your audience's needs and then most importantly, how to make sales feel like a natural part of your blog's experience. So somewhere where readers are able to come and feel empowered and feel served and not directly feel sold to. So this is pretty much about making an impact that also drives income because you know, let's be real. That's what we all kind of wanna do. We wanna be creating content and we wanna run businesses that we love and that provide value to people but that generate us enough income to be able to live the lives that we wanna live. Right? So whether you're new to this idea of sales funnels or whether you're just looking to refine your approach, what my hope is is that you'll be able to create a system that's as seamless as it is possible. Alright. So now that we've covered why a sales funnel is so valuable for bloggers, what I'm gonna do is just dive into what a sales funnel actually looks like and how it applies specifically to blogging.

Jeannette Spencer [00:04:39]:
So a traditional sales funnel consists of 3 main stages and these stages are awareness, consideration and conversion. So when applied to blogging, each of these stages serves a specific purpose. So let's start with stage 1, which we know is the awareness stage and this is where you're kind of bringing new people into your orbit. So your awareness stage content is obviously what you're gonna be using to attract new readers and these are people who are just discovering your blog or maybe even just discovering your industry for the first time. Now to attract readers to your blog, you need content that is going to pull them in and pique their interest and also that's tailored to your target audience's needs. So at this stage, what's important is that your content provides tons and tons of value and I'm stressing that because right now, I don't want you to focus too much on selling. So remember that awareness is about giving first and the reason that we take this approach is so that when our readers come come across our blog and find helpful free information, they're a lot more likely to come back. They're a lot more likely to engage with more of your content and kind of check out what else is that you have on offer.

Jeannette Spencer [00:05:54]:
Now once you actually start attracting readers, you're gonna wanna move them into the consideration stage, which is the engagement phase and this is where you start building a relationship with your audience. So this stage is all about kind of that deeper, more meaningful engagement and it's where your reader readers are gonna start thinking of you as more of an expert expert and someone who can help them solve a specific problem. So when it comes to some effective ways that you can kind of keep them engaged, you could create a blog series, which is a really good way for you to get your readers to keep coming back to your blog. So you can use each part of your blog series to dive into some of the different aspects on a particular topic which then builds interest and again gives your readers a reason to stay engaged and keep coming back. Next, you can also offer free resources or exclusive content like an in-depth guide or a mini course that can be offered in exchange for someone's email address. By offering something extra that's useful, what you're actually doing is giving your readers a taste of the value that you can provide and also getting them interested in the idea of actually working with you in a paid capacity later on down the line. And then lastly, it's super important to be consistent with your content, making sure that you are creating high value pieces every time. So blogging is really good at helping you build credibility and being consistent is a big part of that.

Jeannette Spencer [00:07:22]:
But what's more important is actually creating really high value and quality content, which is really gonna be what's able to establish you as an authority in your field. If readers know that every time they visit your blog, they're gonna walk away with some actionable advice or some really good information, they're gonna be more likely to see you as the go to source and as I mentioned, to keep coming back. And then finally, we have the conversion stage which is where you kind of transition your readers from being fans to becoming customers. Now when it comes to converting readers, the key is to keep your sales messaging really subtle and also helpful whilst using sales tactics. And the easiest way to do this is to just provide them with a solution. So a few soft sales tactics that I wanna share with you that you can include in your blog content are product and service mentions. So let's say you write in a tutorial and you have a product or a service that fits naturally within the context. So what you wanna do is include a small section that says something similar to, if you're looking for a done for you solution, check out and then your your product.

Jeannette Spencer [00:08:38]:
So that would be a link within your blog. Very subtle. So using this kind of approach feels a lot more natural than kind of going in straight with a hard sales pitch. You could also use or share stories on how your product or service has helped other people, which again is another gentle way that you can show potential customers what they stand to gain without overtly saying to them. And this works really well because people tend to love relatable examples when they're able to see themselves in the success of others. Now moving on to call to actions. Now I think it's important for me to say that not every blog post that you create is gonna need a strong call to action. But when it feels relevant, it is your job to guide readers to take the next step, and that could be signing up for a webinar.

Jeannette Spencer [00:09:28]:
It could be downloading your free guide or it could be checking out your product or, you know, directing someone to a sales page. Something else that I think is worth saying is you definitely want to try to make your blog CTA's conversational. So for example, you could say something like, if you're ready to dive in deeper, here's a resource that I think you're gonna love. Again, very subtle. No direct pitch and you know, it just reads a lot better and, you know, when your readers are on your your site, they're not gonna feel like you're directly trying to sell something, but more like you're trying to be helpful. So in each of these three stages, so awareness, consideration and conversion, what you're actually doing is gradually moving readers through the blog funnel without overwhelming them with any strong sales messages. And what you'll also find is that by using this approach, you're creating a genuine connection with your readers and providing them with value and ultimately leading them towards a sale in a way that feels like the natural next step in your relationship. Right.

Jeannette Spencer [00:10:35]:
So now we've looked at the foundation of a blog based sales funnel, now what I wanna do is just speak about selling in a way that respects this relationship and that keeps the authenticity that we will value. But before we dive into the methods of selling, I wanna address the elephant in the room which is always sales resistance. So as I mentioned earlier, I know that for a lot of bloggers or just business owners in general, the idea of selling can sometimes feel a little bit uncomfortable. You might be worried about seeming too pushy or you might feel like you're risking your hard earned readers' trust and you know, you're not alone. This is one of the biggest challenges for content creators across all across all platforms. But to know how to deal with this, we kind of need to understand why we and why our readers resist sales tactics. And it's pretty simple. It's because we know that our readers don't generally come to our blogs to be sold to.

Jeannette Spencer [00:11:31]:
They come for valuable information, insights and also solutions. And so the moment they feel like they're being pitched to or pressured into a cell, it triggers resistance and that's when they jump off the page. Again, our readers are looking for value and then, you know, they're looking for answers to their problem, they're looking for tips, that are gonna make their lives easier or content that's able to inspire them to take some kind of action. This is why I would definitely recommend using an approach which is called solutions first, offer second, and this is where you can transform your mind into kind of thinking of selling as helping rather than pushing. So what you need to do is kind of focus on providing a solution to a problem that your readers are genuinely experiencing, which makes it so much easier for you to then position your product or your service as the natural answer. So by shifting your mindset from selling to serving, what you're actually gonna probably find is that the process of converting the customer is gonna become a lot smoother and feel a lot more genuine and a lot less sleazy. So you might be wondering how do you even position your offers in a way that feels natural and like the next step in your reader's journey? Well, one of the best ways to do this is by is by creating problem solving content And this is where, you know, you think of the most common pain points that your readers are experiencing and you address those problems directly in your blog posts. So for example, let's say your audience struggles with time management.

Jeannette Spencer [00:13:12]:
What you could do is create a post which you could call something like 5 strategies to take control of your time, and then within the post, after you've provided real actionable strategies that you know someone who is struggling with this issue is gonna find valuable, what you would then do is kind of naturally mention your productivity planner or, you know, your time management course or whatever else it is that you sell as that deeper solution for them. And keep in mind that storytelling is super powerful here. So instead of, simply listing the benefits of your product or service, if possible, you wanna be sharing stories or real life transformation. So talk about a client or a customer or even a friend who's faced the same challenge as your reader and explain how your solution has helped them to overcome it. So using storytelling as a sales tactic really does help to build a connection that goes way beyond the transaction. And this is pretty much because it's relatable and it makes the reader see themselves in the success of others which is way more compelling than any sales pitch is ever gonna be. Right. So once we've framed our first the solution, the next step is then to invite readers to take some kind of action in a way that feels friendly, natural and also aligned with the content that they're they're reading.

Jeannette Spencer [00:14:35]:
So for example, you might wanna add a banner to your blog post which encourages people to download freely. So if your post is about goal setting, you know, what you could do is offer something like a goal setting worksheet, but then put something on the page that stands out and that again is the natural next step. So if someone's reading, a blog post about setting goals there and there's a banner there to download a free worksheet, then it's a no brainer to just download that worksheet, which means that they're actually jumping on your email list which again is what you want. And then after someone downloads it, you could then introduce your paid offer on say, master in productivity by way of adding a tripwire. So something that pops up once they've downloaded the free offer to just make them aware or try and get them to buy a paid offer straight away. Or another thing that you can do is just add them directly to an automated email sequence that you can use to nurture and sell to them later on. So this way, what you're actually doing is leading them down a path that starts with value and that builds naturally towards your paid offer. So if you're sharing a tutorial on your blog, you could mention products or tools as part of the process.

Jeannette Spencer [00:15:55]:
So again, for example, you would say something like, I love using my customized notion planner for organizing my projects. It's been a game changer. If you're interested, you can check it out here. And again, you would just simply leave a link. Very subtle. Remember your call to actions should feel friendly and kind of nudge rather than be kind of selling like pitching or hard selling. So think of phrases like, if you're ready to dive in a little deeper, hear something I think you'll love or when you're ready, this is the next step to take and then you would literally just add a little bit of maybe information or one liner about your product product and then just add the link. This way, you create a supportive atmosphere that invites your readers to explore without feeling pressured.

Jeannette Spencer [00:16:48]:
So it's all about making them feel valued and making them feel empowered in their journey. Okay. So next, let's look at how to maintain your reader's trust during the sales process. Now as we know, trust is everything. Once you've built it, the last thing that you wanna do is lose it by coming across as insincere or overly profit driven. And one of the most effective ways to maintain trust is by being transparent. So an example of how you would actually be transparent with your readers is like say you were adding an affiliate product. What you would wanna do is add some kind of really like simple disclaimer.

Jeannette Spencer [00:17:28]:
Something that says something like, I may earn a small commission if you choose to purchase, but I only recommend products I truly believe in. Something like this goes a really long way when it comes to building transparency and also building trust. And then next, always provide more than you take. So this principle is literally one of the core values in sustainable sales. So your readers should always feel like they're getting value from your content even if they don't buy anything. So even if they choose not to buy. So for example, in a post where you're promoting a paid course or you know, some kind of other offer, you really wanna be given some substantial tips and action actionable advice within the blog post itself. This is because that way, whether they decide to make a purchase or not, they're still walking away feeling like they gained something which is super powerful.

Jeannette Spencer [00:18:18]:
And then when it comes to balancing sales with value, try to offer content that's 80% value and 20% sales. This balance is what kind of keeps your audience engaged without overwhelming them with constant offers. Trust me. When people see that you're there to help them 1st and sell second, it really does build trust and long term loyalty which really does impact your bottom line. So in each of these three methods, you're presenting offers as helpful suggestions and not as pressure tactics. And by delivering solutions that your readers need, by positioning cells as a way to serve and keeping your communication transparent and friendly, what you'll find is that selling without the sleaze is not only possible but it's super effective. Alright. Now that we've explored the mechanics of a sales funnel and discussed how to sell without compromising your authenticity, In this final section, what I wanna do is just bring it all together by walking you through an example of a blog post that moves readers from awareness to conversion.

Jeannette Spencer [00:19:21]:
So keeping in line with the example that I used earlier, I actually do have a blog post on my website called 5 strategies for managing your time more effectively which I'm gonna be referring to during this walkthrough. So for the opening of my post, what I've done is begun by discussing a common pain point that I know people experience when it comes to time management. And this is always gonna be feeling overwhelmed, you know, feeling constantly behind on tasks and struggling to balance work with personal time. So during the opening, it's pretty much where you wanna be speaking to your audience's needs and capturing their attention by actually addressing the problems that they're likely gonna be facing. And the next one I'm doing is walking readers through 5 actionable strategies that they can start using straight away. So each strategy is something easy that they can implement on their own like using a Pomodoro technique, setting realistic goals or planning their day the night before. So this is the value driven content that I know is gonna keep readers engaged and that is gonna build that trust. And then towards the end so for your content, after you've shared your strategies, you might say something like, if these ideas resonate with you and you'd like a step by step framework, for whatever it is your blog post is about, I have a free downloadable worksheet that walks you through blah blah blah.

Jeannette Spencer [00:20:49]:
So what you're actually doing here is deepening the engagement by offering a free resource that allows readers to take action beyond the blog post. And this is really, really important when it comes to the kind of follow through to from, awareness to conversion. So this will essentially lead to an email sign up which is a great way for you to build that stronger connection with your audience. And then finally, as you wrap up your post, you might say something like for those of you who are ready to go all in on improving and then whatever it is. So in this example, improving your productivity, my complete time management course dives deep into techniques and includes personalized coaching to help you create a system that works for your lifestyle. So that's just an example. But by positioning your course or your product as a deeper, more comprehensive solution, You make it a natural progression for readers who kind of wanna invest further in solving their problem and it's a gentle nudge. It's not a hard sell and it feels like the next logical step for those people who are truly invested and who truly want to make a change.

Jeannette Spencer [00:22:05]:
So what I'm doing is offering something free for those people who maybe are not quite ready to make that financial investment straight away, but who would still like something to help them take action. And the beauty of this is that when they actually download my free offer, I'm then gonna have their email address and be able to sell to them again later on. And then for those people who are ready, because there will be some people who are just ready to take media action, I've also introduced my paid offer. So this approach keeps the flow of the blog post natural and the reader doesn't feel like they're being pushed to buy, but instead, they're given a choice at every step which moves them through the funnel at their own pace. Alright. So now that we've laid the groundwork for turning your readers into loyal customers, let's dive into what you should do once someone actually engages with your content. So this is a crucial step in the sales process because let's face it, some readers, as I mentioned, are gonna jump straight in and make a purchase, but that's not gonna be the the majority. Most people are going to need some kind of extra nudge and that's totally normal.

Jeannette Spencer [00:23:19]:
And this is where turning your readers into leads should really become a key part of your blog strategy. And to do this effectively, you do need to really understand your customer's journey and you also need to appreciate that not every reader is gonna be at the same stage in their journey. Some are gonna be, as I mentioned earlier, ready to buy. Others are gonna be just sticking their toes in the water. You know, some people are just gonna wanna be learning more especially before they do something like, again, spend money with you or take the plunge. And your goal is to meet them where they are and guide them through that journey. So once someone engages with your content, maybe they downloaded your free resource or maybe they've subscribed to your email list, that's the time to kick off your follow-up process and you're gonna do this by creating a welcome email sequence. So first, you're gonna welcome them.

Jeannette Spencer [00:24:14]:
You're gonna start by sending them a warm, friendly email, thanking them for their interest and letting them know what they can expect from you moving forward. And this is your chance to kind of set the tone for your relationship. So when it comes to your follow-up sequence, you always wanna be providing value. Take note of what made them sign up in the first place. If it was a post that you created on productivity, for example, then you know that that's where their interest lies. So use this insight and over the next few emails that you send out to them, share additional tips, resources, and also insights on this topic. You really wanna use the data that you have to create engaging content that you know they're gonna be interested in. Right? This is actually called email segmentation and this is what will really help to increase your conversions.

Jeannette Spencer [00:25:08]:
You also wanna be making sure that these emails are personal and relatable. So don't just send out generic emails. Use your readers' names. You probably already know this stuff. This is very basic stuff and reference their specific interests as I mentioned. Always add your personality and your unique tone, making sure that your email sounds the same or very similar to the voice that you use when you create your blog posts. Also, don't be afraid to share some of your personal experiences with those people on your email list because this type of content is what is essentially gonna make your communication feel a lot more genuine and make it easier for you to continue to build that connection with those people on your email list. And then moving on to social proof.

Jeannette Spencer [00:25:56]:
So as I mentioned earlier, people love to see other people win. Right? And they love to see other people succeed especially if they can relate to those experiences. And that's why sharing things like testimonials, sharing reviews and case studies can really work wonders and your emails are a great place for you to share this type of content. When potential customers see that others have benefited from your product, they're more likely to take the plunge themselves. And then it's super important to be offering a transition to sales. So once your leads are engaging with your emails and feeling connected to your content, that's a great time to gently guide them back towards making a purchase. And as you guide your audience, remember that your offers should feel like the natural next step in their journey. Okay.

Jeannette Spencer [00:26:49]:
Now lastly, the only way that you're gonna be able to make sure your blog is having the desired impact that you want is to track the data. So write all the blog in a day and it might take a while for you to start seeing consistent engagement and sales from your blog, making it even more important to track your metrics so that you can accurately measure the success of your blog based funnel at each stage. So this is essentially what is gonna help you to be able to understand what's working, what's not working, and also where readers might be dropping off and how to adjust your strategy for better results. Now when it comes to awareness stage metrics, the goal here is to bring new readers to your blog and track metrics like page views, unique visitors, and referral sources, which is pretty much where your traffic is coming from. So for this, I would recommend using a tool like Google Analytics, which is great at providing you with in-depth insights on these kind of metrics and which allows you to see which posts you're creating that are attracting the most traffic and also where your readers are coming from. And then when it comes to the consideration stage, engagement is really key. So I would definitely spend time looking at metrics like the average time on page, the bounce rate and also the scroll depth to see how deeply readers are actually engaging with your content. So you also gonna wanna monitor your email sign ups as these are a really strong indicator of interest and this this is gonna show you how well your content is actually converting your readers into subscribers.

Jeannette Spencer [00:28:24]:
And then finally, you should be tracking how many of those readers are actually becoming customers. And to do this, you need to be monitoring your conversion rates on specific call to actions. And these conversion rates include how many people are clicking on your product page or your sales page or your sign up page from your blog post. So here, you're gonna wanna pay close attention to those posts that are driving the most sales and which calls to action are performing the best. Tracking these metrics is gonna make it easier when it comes to making informed decisions from choosing which post to actually promote to understanding where to tweak call to actions or add lead magnets. So it's important to understand that the more data that you have is the more you're gonna be able to refine each stage of the funnel to create maximum conversions. Okay. So by following a step by step system within each blog post, by planning your content with both engagement and sales in mind and creating a system that captures leads and also adding a follow-up process and tracking your metrics every stage, you can then create a balanced authentic funnel that's able to align with your values and serve your readers' needs.
