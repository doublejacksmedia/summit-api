[00:00:09.480] - Liz Stapleton, Summit Host
I'm super excited for today's session with Meera Kotland, who is a best selling author, that's, I think, how I came across her and I see her books. Amazon is always suggesting more of her books to me. Meera welcome and thank you for doing this.

[00:00:22.620] - Meera Kotland, meerakothand.com
Thank you so much for having me. Really excited to be here today.

[00:00:26.010] - Liz
Yeah. So, if you want to give people a little more about your background, just so they kind of have an idea where you're coming from and dive into our topic today.

[00:00:34.140] - Meera
Sure. So the usual little story I always share with people is that I never wanted to be an entrepreneur. So I came into this like four years ago. I was in corporate my you know, my whole background is about everything told while I was raised is going to get a job, stuff like that. So, I kind of fell into this by accident. And everything I did was pretty much just finding my way through it, a set of things that I did clicked and I started blogging and then growing my audience and then creating products and books and stuff like that.

[00:01:15.300] - Meera
So the main thing that enchants my audience is about creating digital products and about how to use e-mail marketing to sell right. And selling doesn't have to be sleezy. So this is in a nutshell, kind of what I share with my audience and how I kind of came into the online space pretty much by accident. I'm not really the kid who want to, you know, who was selling lemonade or anything of that sort. So, yeah.

[00:01:41.940] - Liz
Yeah, because I think because I think people are like "Oh you need your email list." "You need you email list." You need your email list." And you go like "I'm paying a lot of money for my email list. When does it start paying for itself. Right. So, I know today we're going to be talking about brand name or building brand building nurture sequences. So what is the nurture sequence and why is it important?

[00:02:03.880] - Meera
Yeah, and then on the observation about the email lit option, and I know it can be kind of a very tricky situation in the early days because you're not making money, but people tell you you need an email to make money, so you need to be paying for that. So what happens when it's kind of hard in the early days. I agree with that. But if I can give one concrete tip, it's not to go with an email service provider just because they're free. Because you have to be in it for the long game. So choose a provider that is yes obviously within your budget, but be with someone who you feel you could grow with, who would be able to kind of grow with your business. So look at the fields that they have, stuff like that.

[00:02:51.850] - Liz
[inaudible]

[00:02:52.210] - Meera
Sorry?

[00:02:51.850] - Liz
I was just gonna say switching email providers is a nightmare- switching hosts is super easy. Switching email marketing service.

[00:03:03.990] - Meera
Nightmare.

[00:03:04.060] - Liz
Horrendous.

[00:03:07.160] - Meera
Yeah, exactly. So that is a lot of the a lot of comments that I get from subscribers saying that it's a nice kind of switching between so you don't want to happen to you, especially when you're in the middle of a launch or you're launching your first product and stuff like that.

[00:02:52.210] - Meera
So pick a tool provider who has features and stuff like that that you think you're going to use will serve your audience as well. So that's just kind of like a quick tip. So as a service provider, even though you're not making any money, even though you have nothing for sale, you need to have an email list. And a lot of people who tell me that, "You know, I think I will do this after I have done some things, after I have maybe 20 posts on my site, or maybe I released or launched 20 videos." It doesn't work that way because, all right, you have all this content and maybe people have come to find that those pieces of content. But you're not doing anything to capture those people onto your email list if you don't have one in the first place. So you absolutely need to have one. And you can't just have one as like a placeholder. You need to do a couple of things. And that is one of the first things you should do is to have that note in sequence.

[00:04:17.500] - Meera
So it's kind of like rolling out the red carpet for a new subscriber. You are kind of paving the way for them to discover your brand yourself because the last thing you want to do someone to get on your email list and then they don't get anything. They don't hear from you. And the next time they hear you is maybe three months later or six months later when you're ready to launch your first product and they probably lost, you're going to get lots of unsubscribes. You're not going- you haven't done anything to build up that trust or authority with that audience in order for them to even buy from you in the first place. So, yeah, that's where a natural sequence comes into play. And I think we'll be telling more about what they can put into nurture sequence and stuff like that. But, yeah, just just kind of an introduction about what a nurture sequence is. Basically a couple of emails that just goes out to anyone that subscribes.

[00:05:10.840] - Meera
So, you can have someone subscribing today. You can have someone subscribing three months later, but they get the same notice.

[00:05:16.920] - Liz
Yeah, because I think some of us forget that we may not have been a long time fan of our blogs before they sign up. It may have been afraid to cut their eye. And so they don't know you so nurture sequence is great to introduce yourself to them and what you do. So what should besides whatever incentive you've got to get them on the email list, what what should you be sending them once they're on their lists, the nurture sequence? What should that look like? Right.

[00:05:42.580] - Meera
So, usually I kind of go by like a minimum, a minimum viable nurture sequence, because when people think of nurture sequences, they think that has to be like a month long or sixty days long. And when you think of something of that magnitude, usually you never get it done. So what do you have to do is think what is the least number of emails I can get out there and I always suggest three to five. Okay. But if you can push yourself a little bit more, I would say go ahead and do five to seven, because this would give everyone kind of like a nice introduction to everything that you do.

[00:06:19.420] - Meera
So, the exact kind of emails that you should put in there, it doesn't have to be content that is absolutely from scratch. You can write teases to existing blog post that you have or you can write teasers to existing videos that you have. The kind of things that I like to share in my emails are a lot about awareness building because regardless of the needs that you're in, we all whether you're in the fitness niche or the parenting niche, or whether the productivity niche, you know, it really doesn't matter. But we are all there to solve some kind of a problem for our audience and to provide solutions. And they all have different kinds of pain points.

[00:06:58.240] - Meera
So when I say pain points, people immediately think, "But I really have a pain point." The thing is, a pain point doesn't just mean not having money or it doesn't just mean I don't know how to start a business. There are different kinds of pain points. It could be I don't know how to organize my kid's closet or I don't know how to homeschool or I don't know how to do meal planning. There are so many different types of pain points. And for me, the initial part of a nurture sequence is about bringing awareness to the pain point, because a lot of people that join your they are not necessarily going to be aware of the magnitude of the pain point, or they might not be aware that there are solutions out there for the problems that they're facing, regardless of the niche that you're in. So, when you have this kind of content within your nurture sequence something that that shares maybe stories about people you've helped, clients you've helped, or telling them about certain mistakes that they may be making that they're not even aware. So, when you do it like this, you are setting yourself up to be seen as an expert or someone they can trust.

[00:08:10.880] - Meera
So, I usually like to do this within the first one to three emails. So you always have- you have to welcome email. And then I like to talk about mistakes people make or things that they believe that are not necessarily true. We all believe in myths and things that we may have heard and we think are true, but they might be hindering our progress or they might be kind of hindering and interfering with the way that we work or do certain things. So, when you bring this to light, that is where people are going to reply back to you. They're going to engage with you and you when they see your name in their inbox this is where they are going to move into clicking your email. So you're nurture sequence kind of sets the pot and paves the way for that.

[00:08:59.630] - Liz
Yeah, because one thing I've learned in the last year is, it's not so much your email subject line that gets people talking. It's your name.

[00:09:05.720] - Meera
Yeah, exactly. And a lot of people ask me, "What subject lines work the best?" And I say, "You know, it's not really a subject line. Its more your name, especially for if you are not really doing like e-commerce kind, but it's all about discounts and products and stuff like that. When you're building a personal brand or you're a coach or you're a content creator of the kind, it's really about your name. And once your name is associated with value, once your name is associated with any kind of emotion, it doesn't just have to be about, "Hey, this girl or this lady provides good information." It could even be about she's funny or she's inspirational or she makes me feel good in the morning. You know, it could be any of that wants to have that association people are going to be opening your emails regardless of the subject line.

[00:09:53.600] - Liz
Yeah, because, I mean, when you think about it, I mean, there are certain emails because I'm on a lot of newsletters. I've been blogging for years. Like I'm on a ton of newsletters and there are certain ones that I automatically open as soon as they come to my inbox. And others are like, "Uh, maybe I'll read that later."

[00:10:07.400] - Meera
Exactly.

[00:10:07.880] - Liz
Like, it really does make a difference. Okay, so how do you- one thing I want to ask you is you're kind of making them aware of a pain point. How do you do that without being like a Debbie Downer? Right. No one likes the negative Nancy, who's like, "This is her problem, huh? This is it." There's solutions out there all eventually tell you what they are like. But how do you kind of approach that? Yeah.

[00:09:53.600] - Meera
So when you are talking about pain points, you- I get what you mean- you shouldn't really just be throwing out, "Hey, this is wrong. This is wrong." You shouldn't be doing this, but where possible you should be kind of weaving in solutions as well. And for me, when I  send an email like this, I, I usually would encourage them to reply back to me. And I do take the time to just kind send them a quick reply. Or even if you can say, you know, "If you do feel like you're making all of these mistakes, don't worry, hang in there, because the next few emails, I'm going to cover this. So you could be kind of, you know, you could kind of be saying like, all right, these are the mistakes. I hear you. You're worried, but I got your back in the next couple of emails. In this nurture sequence, I will be sending you pieces of content that can help you kind of rectify these mistakes."

[00:11:23.150] - Meera
So, we are building awareness and then you can kind of bring in your solutions. So, this is where you can actually link to pieces of content on your blog or your video, because- or your YouTube channel or Podcast where maybe you have discussed how to kind of content. So, those are perfect because they are kind of like the early part of the- your solutions are obviously your office products that could be coaching, could be a service you provide. But we all if we are doing content marketing right, we would have pieces of content that talk about that, how to be that up pillar post or pillar videos. So, these are the ones that you can link to in your nurture sequence that would kind of balance out this, like you mentioned, this fear of this worry that your initial emails have kind of given them. But for me, you know, it really depends on the tone that you use, the way you're putting it across. It shouldn't really be about striking them down or kind of schooling them and everything they've been doing wrong. But it's to really just, "Hey, did you notice or did you know that this is not necessarily true because blah-blah-blah". Or sharing a story and then weaving in the point. So, when you do it in that way, it doesn't have to be- it doesn't have to come across harsh or it doesn't have to be. You don't have to come across because we like-

[00:12:47.270] - Liz
I've been there, you know.

[00:12:48.900] - Meera
Yeah. Exactly.

[00:12:50.070] - Liz
[Inaudible] I've done it. Or some clients have been there and there's nothing like them, you know, and it's okay like you can just doing what you like.

[00:12:57.800] - Meera
You don't want to come in high and mighty and say you hate blah, blah, blah, you've done this. That's not what you want to sound like.

[00:13:04.940] - Liz
Yeah. Okay, so we've said, you know, three to five emails, ideally five to seven and you do the first one and you kind of then we points of your content and stuff. But is there a specific order that you need to be hitting things or weaving in content, or do you need to be giving them other freebies? What's...?

[00:13:25.520] - Meera
Right. Okay. So, I- this is really based on what you're comfortable with. I like to do the first three emails back to back. And the reason is because studies have shown that the first 48 hours or so- 46 to 36 hours is when people are the most engaged with your brand. I mean, it makes sense because they would have found a piece of content or found your lead magnet, signed up. So, that is when your name is really fresh in their minds. So, when you send them emails within those few do those two days or three days, they are going to be- they're going to remember you. And your name is kind of you're going to be building layers of trust in that sense compared toll all right, get a welcome email one whole week and then another email. So, you don't really get to cement or build on that initially of trust. And so that it's kind of like my rationale for doing it this way. I do the first three back to back after that, I going to space it out. I do it maybe one every two days and then three days. I space it out after that because I've done the initial work of kind of yeah getting my name across. But when I mentioned this to people, some of them are like, "I don't think it works for my audience because they are moms. I don't think they are comfortable with getting this kind of a frequency. Well, this is something you need to test out. So if you're going to- if you have that kind of an audience, maybe people who are busy, who don't really want to check their emails, I think that's fine. You could try this like what I said, do the first three back to back. And if you feel that a lot of people are kind of unsubscribing within those few emails or you're losing a lot of people, then go easy on the other frequency.

[00:15:12.350] - Liz
Cut it out, but don't go automatically every week because a lot can happen in a week. Have you looked at Twitter?

[00:15:17.570] - Meera
Yeah, exactly. I know, right? Yeah. So, for me, the first three emails I always get very healthy opens because they're kind of looking out for my name and the inbox and because of the nature of those emails is awareness building is letting talking to them about mistakes kind of building that. Yeah. Kind of letting them know that these are the things they need to correct. Because of that, the opens and the clicks are going to be very healthy, especially the initial emails. So.

[00:15:50.790] - Meera
So, yeah, this is kind of the frequency that I suggest now when it comes to giving out freebies in your natural sequence to answer that. I was I had the my initial thought process with this whole thing is that you need to be giving away lots and lots of freebies. I need to give them something free. If not, they are going to feel like they're not getting enough value. That was my line of thought when I first started out. And I was so wrong because it can actually do a lot more damage then than good, because when you get your audience used to just getting freebies, whether they use it or not, it's going to come back and bite you.

[00:16:29.480] - Liz
[inaudible].

[00:16:32.930] - Meera
Yeah, yeah, that's one thing. And you're also just building a list of passive consumers. I mean, you don't really know they're taking action. For all they know, they're going to be downloading this and then keeping it in their files. And people just kind of feel safe that information is there regardless of whether they use it or not. So, I would rather create content that gets them to think than feed them with information that I don't know if they're going to use or not.

[00:16:58.690] - Meera
So, apart from the initial lead magnet that you are going to be giving them it's not really necessary that you have to continuously be giving them some kind of some kind of a freebie. If it's like content on your site. That's something that you always are going to be creating, right whether it's for a blog or a YouTube channel. But apart from that, like new pieces just for your subscribers, I don't think it's necessary at all.

[00:17:23.300] - Liz
Okay. No, I do like that. So, a couple of follow questions on that. What would you consider to be a good open return after six months?

[00:17:35.620] - Meera
Okay. I don't- I can't remember the actual stats, but the welcome email obviously has one of the highest open rates. You could see open rates like 60% easily on your welcome email. So for me, it's about their 60 plus and then over- any nurture sequence your open rates would kind of fall as people progress on. But the initial emails, you can aim for open rates of like 50% or 40%. The smaller list is very likely you would get a lot a much bigger open rate but in general, if you're asking like industry wide, I think if you are going to get anything above 20% it's considered kind of good. For personal brands I would say if you starting out if you are going to get 30% and above, it's pretty good. But yeah, the first few e-mails in a nurture sequence always aimed for 50% above and it's not difficult to hit at all. And the other thing is, don't just be lulled into, all right, open rate is good. But if you have a call to action in there, if you're asking people to click on something, have a look at your click through rates as well. See if people are clicking on those links. Because if they are not clicking on those links, then it means that you haven't really set up the link in that sense. You haven't really built that email up such that people want to click on that link. So, it could be that they don't really see the need to click on that link or maybe you've just given everything away such that people don't really want to click on that anymore. So, a few different situations over here.

[00:19:22.680] - Liz
Okay. So, another question I have is you talked about them really looking for emails the first few days, of course, the welcome one they're going to look for- they just signed up. [inaudible] How do you keep them looking out for your name? Is it typically just like a teaser of I'll be back tomorrow with X. Or is it more than that?

[00:19:42.630] - Meera
Yeah. So, I usually like to use the P as the post postscript. That is, I would say really precious email real estate. I mean, I don't know. Sometimes I think it's kind of like- it's like an unconscious thing. We would just scroll down and look at the very bottom because we don't really have the time. So, whenever there's something important that you want people to take, it's good to repeat that in the piece.

[00:20:10.650] - Meera
So for me, in nurture sequences, what I do is because the first three I send it back to back or the first couple of emails, it's going to be pretty in terms of frequency is going to be going out quite fast. I would tell them, "By the way, tomorrow I'm going to be sharing", and then I would give them like maybe it's it could be a frequently asked questions that everyone has in my niche, or it could be the one thing that clients always do, but then they shouldn't. Something like that. Something that kind of teases them. It gets them- it intrigues them to want to know what the answer to this is. And I have had so many responses when I put something like this and they say, "Really looking forward to tomorrow's email" or "I'm so happy I signed up, I really want to know the answer to this. I'm looking forward to tomorrow." So, this is how you kind of set it up. And the only way you can do this is in a sequence because you know what exactly comes next? What comes next? What comes next?

[00:21:08.080] - Liz
You have to be really on top and super organized on a  regular.

[00:21:10.090] - Meera
Exactly. Yeah. Yeah, SEO. And you can build up the intrigue and all of that to get them to look out for the next email. So it's it's not automatic. You need to put in the work to do it in the email.

[00:21:26.070] - Liz
Okay, so would you pretty much always recommend having your call to action, whatever it is in your PS, is there a time where you have something else on that PS?

[00:21:33.780] - Meera
So I like to do multiple PS's, but I would like just to tease my audience a little bit.

[00:21:44.730] - Liz
I've done a few.

[00:21:44.730] - Meera
Yeah. So I would have like a call to action there. But but sometimes I would kind of add like like a funny comment in the PPS. So, yeah, I mean, there's no hard and fast rule is it's really kind of figuring out your style and going from that. But the main thing is if this unless you're doing newsletter style. What I call a newsletter is where you've got multiple links and you're talking about a few different things. The kind of emails that I suggest you put in your nurture sequence are single goal emails.

[00:22:21.310] - Meera
Each email has one call to action or at most two call to actions. And they have a very specific message or very specific goal for each email. So, those are different from a newsletter where it is like an update. It's got a few different things and stuff like that. So, yes PS always repeat your call to action that you've included at the very beginning. I have seen, like I mentioned, I like to do like a quirky comment sometimes or sometimes. I would also say, by the way, hit reply and tell me just like an answer to one question or something like that. So a call to action you could do. You could also do like a reply back to me. Let me know what you thought, stuff like that. So yeah, use your PS to the max. But it's best not to have multiple calls to action because then your audience doesn't really-

[00:23:13.950] - Liz
You're making them think.

[00:23:15.040] - Meera
Action on any. Yeah. Exactly. You don't want them to think too much.

[00:23:17.710] - Liz
Yeah. You want to make it easy for them to make a decision.

[00:23:20.770] - Meera
Correct.

[00:23:21.850] - Liz
Okay, so what would you say is the biggest mistake people are making with their nurture sequences?

[00:23:28.760] - Meera
I would. Okay, the first thing is not having enough a nurture sequence. Yeah, but the I think most people, if they they had this in place, then if they have a nurture sequence in place, they are actually having- they are putting in some effort into it. So, that's a good thing. But I think the misconception that I feel I've seen a lot of people make of subscribers and clients I've worked with is that they think that it's all about just sharing content and they feel that they cannot be selling anything via a nurture sequence.

[00:24:05.840] - Meera
So, yeah, so they feel that nurture sequence is a nurture sequence. If I want to pitch them something, it should be something that's completely separate. But I like to weed both both of them in together. So I, completely don't agree with the fact that a nurture sequence is just purely about nurture. I think there is a place for you to sell and build your brand and build trust at the same time, and it can be done very seamlessly. So, if you do have something for sale or you do want them to take some specific action, you can actually include that in your nurture sequence. But of course, do your due diligence. You don't want to be selling that in the first email or the second email. You don't want to be doing that. You want to make sure you've done enough to get them ready to say yes to that offer. So, if you've done that, then regardless, even if it's in the sequence, you can go ahead and sell.

[00:24:59.870] - Liz
Okay, gotcha. And does it always have to be selling one of your products or could you sell an affiliate link? Do you do that in a nurture sequence at all, like tools or something or...?

[00:25:10.940] - Meera
Absolutely, so you yeah, I do that as well. So, if the main thing is the tools or the products or offers that you are going to be sharing has to be linked to the topic that they just opted in for. So there's going to be a right now that they opted in for, that is going to be part of one category, a bucket of content.

[00:25:32.570] - Meera
And the nurture sequence has to be related to that as well. So whatever tools and products, even if it's not yours that you're sharing, has to be linked to that. So, as long as it's relevant, you're good. The only place where people would be like kind of raising eyebrows is that what- what does this- what does this have to do with? Why am I getting this? I didn't even sign up for this. So, you don't want that even that little bit of that mistrust or that that raised eyebrows kind of feeling, you know, what am I getting? You don't want that. So as long as it's linked, you're fine. You don't even need to have your own product. You could share affiliate products and offers. And I do that as well.

[00:26:10.320] - Liz
Okay. So, how hard do you push a product during a nurture sequence? Right. Because it's one thing to kind of an email for casually mention like, oh, this could be a solution. It's another to follow and have the email focused on what you're selling. Where do you draw the line on that and how do you make that bit?

[00:26:10.320] - Meera
Yeah. So for me, I, I like to mention the offer early, very early in any sequence that I have. So, usually like just like how you say it's a casual mention and I do this for like at least two or three emails, just a casual mention, so that it kind of sees the idea of that offer. It gets them familiar with the name of the author so that when I'm going to be when the whole email, the entire email is going to be talking about the benefits of that offer, they're not going to be kind of taken aback because I've done that little bit of build up and I've mentioned this along the way. So, it's not like in your face kind of thing all of a sudden. And I say, "Hey, go buy this." You don't want to do that. Which is why I always recommend mentioning it early compared to mentioning only when at the very end of the sequence. So, there are some that I mentioned as early as the third email and obviously it's not like a hard pitch kind of email is just like a casual mention.

[00:27:32.150] - Meera
By the way, this is something that I talk about in this course. That's about it. That's all. No link. Nothing at all just to name. And then in the next one I could say this is exactly what student in this course experienced  as well. No link. Nothing else. Just the name. So, you're kind of building up the anticipation that people are going to be, "Okay. Maybe I could check this out. I'm looking for this. She has this course, so let me see what else she has. When does she open?" You might get some replies? Are you going to open this soon as the surprise and stuff like that? So, at the end, when you're ready to finally start to mention what exactly your offer is about, the actual sales page and stuff like that, people are not going to be taken aback because you didn't fling this at them out of nowhere. This is like, you know, within their email inbox from the very- from the very beginning. Yeah.

[00:28:25.130] - Liz
Okay. No, I like that. I'm like, "Oh, I need to adjust some of my nutures. Okay, so any sort of final words or advice for people just starting out with the nurture sequence, who or who like me have them or tweak a few things. Any, any final words of advice?

[00:28:45.510] - Meera
I think the only one thing I would say is, there's no way you can get it to be perfect. I think that's a lot of- that's something a lot of people struggle with because they never get it out, because they want it to be perfect. They want to get everything right. And it just doesn't happen that way. Like, my- the nurture sequence I have right now is completely different from what I had when I started out. And things evolve. Things change. Your messaging changes and you will discover how to write better, how to- the tone of your emails will change as well. So, as long as you're comfortable with it, I would say just publish it. Let it go live.

[00:29:24.960] - Liz
Done is better than perfect.

[00:29:26.520] - Meera
Yeah, exactly. Rather than just stick to it. And you wouldn't believe it, but there are people who've been kind of communicating with me for years and they're going to do this, they're going to launch this and they haven't. And it's easily like two to three years. And sometimes I feel sad, but they just stop because they just can't let go and just get it out there and see how the responses, see how the engagement is. Because the only way you can tweak is once you have people actively going through that sequence, you wouldn't be able to do anything before that.

[00:29:59.100] - Meera
But people spend so much time just tweaking and tweaking and tweaking without having their audience go through it. So, if there's just one takeaway, I would say do the bare minimum to just have three to five or you can push yourself, do five to seven. And always batch those emails. Don't do one today. Okay, I'm going to do another tomorrow. Don't do that. Sit down and then batch it out. Like if you have like a chunk of time, like three hours or two hours or something like that, when your kids are in school or whatever that might be, just get those emails out. I think for email batching specifically helps very much because your mind is in that place, that zone, and you know exactly what comes next and all that. And I've noticed that when I have breaks in between and then I go off and do something else and come back, "oh gosh, it's so difficult to get back in that." So yeah.

[00:30:49.800] - Liz
Yeah, yeah. And we have sessions on batching because you don't have to sit down and do it all you can batch all the outlines and then the writing and then you have to go into the editing. So, don't feel like you have to like start finish in one sitting. Right. But, but try to get through all of them before you kind of move on to the next part of it, because that'll help with your writing too. All right. That was awesome. Thank you so much. Now, I know you have a free resource for our attendees. Do you want to tell us a little bit about it?

[00:31:21.570] - Meera
Yeah, sure. So, I have a free course on email. It's an email, course and emails together. But yeah. So, the link is the short link is Mira.email/course you can go and have it-
