Hello, everyone. I'm Meera. I'm an in marketing strategist and author of the books, The 1 Hour Content Plan, Selling Intangible, 300 Email Marketing Tips, and a couple of others that you will see on Amazon. And today, I'm really excited to be speaking to you about a topic that is very near and dear to my heart.

[00:00:30.310] - Meera
We're going to be focusing on a specific aspect of email marketing, all right? And we're going to be diving really deep into the topic of newsletters.

[00:00:38.580] - Meera
So, for a lot of people that I work with, when they think of email, they think of a newsletter. Okay, this might be you as well. But is the newsletter the best tool for you to build trust with your audience, for you to build authority, and for you to guide your audience through that customer journey? That's what we're going to be discussing in today's session.

[00:01:00.900] - Meera
So, if you've always wanted to know whether the emails you're sending are the best fit, if you've always wanted to know the type of emails you should actually even be sending out to build trust and authority with your audience, then you are going to get a lot out of today's session. So, if you're ready, let's dive right in.

[00:01:17.580] - Meera
Now, before we talk about the type of emails that you should be sending and the role of the newsletter as one of those emails, right, let's look at the logic picture, okay? What role does email actually play in your larger content marketing strategy? Because for most people, they're very clear that they need to be creating content. All right. They know that they should be creating content, whether that is via a blog or a podcast or a YouTube channel. But email is something that they don't really know how to integrate. They always view email as being separate from their content strategy, so they always focus on their YouTube channel, their podcast, their blog, or even social media.

[00:02:06.540] - Meera
Okay. But email is something that they're just very, very unclear and they just don't know how to integrate that. But email is also another aspect of your larger content marketing strategy. So, everything has to be linked. So, if you've got your marketing and your business goals, okay, from there, you derive your content strategy. Okay, so content is not good to have, right? Content is something that has to be linked with your marketing and business goals. It's not a good to have or it's not a nice to have. It's integral, and it has to be linked to your marketing and business goals.

[00:02:45.450] - Meera
The content that you create has to be derived from those goals that you have. Or you can't say that, all right, I'm going to be creating this type of content because this type of content is the one that's going to help me go viral. All right. Yes, it might help you go viral, but it's not necessarily the type of content that's going to be attracting the right people to your brand ecosystem.

[00:03:11.100] - Meera
Now, when we're talking about email. I always like to refer to the five step activation process to kind of give you an idea of how the flow is like for someone who is coming into your brand ecosystem. So, let's say they hear you on a show, or they stumble across a post of yours or a show of yours.

[00:03:35.080] - Meera
All right?

[00:03:35.380] - Meera
So that is step one. That's your traffic soft, okay? So, from your traffic source, they would opt in to some kind of a free resource. It could be a lead magnet or a form of some kind. Okay, so that is where you capture their email address, all right and then you want to redirect them to a thank you page or a onetime offer page. So, a onetime offer page is where you have a very low-cost offer that you see. Some people call it a tripwire, okay?

[00:04:05.490] - Meera
So, this is to give them a taste of your paid content. So, the moment they encounter your thank you page or onetime offer, regardless of whether they buy or they don't, all right, then you send them a welcome email, and then you send them a nurture sequence. All right. It could be five to seven emails within an email sequence. So, this is the five-step activation process, and this is kind of like the journey that every single person who is coming into contact with your brand would take. Again, when you do it in this way, it ensures that you know, you're creating a very good experience for someone. And through the content that you're sending in your email sequence, they also get to know you and your brand better.

[00:04:49.390] - Meera
They get to know your point of view. They get to know the perspectives that you share when it comes to the topic of the problem that you're helping them solve. So, basically, you are creating a brand ecosystem with your list at the center. So, right at the center, you've got your email list. And regardless of where someone stumbles across your brand or where they come into contact with your brand, all right, all roads lead to your email list.

[00:05:20.460] - Meera
So, whether that's in social media, whether you are guesting for someone else, or whether you appear on someone else's show, or whether you have your own show, okay, regardless of where you have your brand footprint, all right, all roads should lead to your email list. Okay.

[00:05:39.880] - Meera
Now, one of the biggest email fails, and it's important to understand what this is, so that you're very clear about whether you are inadvertently making these mistakes due to the type of content that you're sending. Okay? So, how can it go wrong with email is if your email list can't connect you with your products or services, and your email list does not trust you. So, you may be sending content, but they still don't connect you with a particular topic, or they don't trust you, or they're just not able to see you with those offers.

[00:06:17.530] - Meera
Okay? They just can't make the connect. So, this is what I call content expert association. And when there is no content expert association, it is very, very difficult to be able to sell to your email list and very difficult for you to build authority and have a trusting relationship such that they want to do business with you. Okay.

[00:06:41.080] - Meera
Perhaps you're building a list of freebie seekers and not buyers, right? So, when you have a lead magnet that is not specific, that's not relevant, that has nothing to do with what you want to be known for, or has nothing to do with the offers that you have or the services that you're offering, then you are building a list of freebie seekers, again, not biased. Now, you may be adding a lot and lot of people to your email list, but these people may not be the right audience. These people may not be your ideal clients.

[00:07:15.630] - Meera
Now, if you have a list but you've not sent them anything, this is another type of problem to have, then obviously, you're not building trust and you're not going to be top of mind. And if you're not effectively selling via email, which means the content that you're sending doesn't prime or nudge your subscribers. Okay? So, now how does a newsletter come into play with these mistakes? Now, this is what I mean by a newsletter. Okay. Let's kind of get on the same page. For me, a newsletter is an email that has a couple of different links, again, it doesn't just focus on one main topic or one main message, right?

[00:07:55.240] - Meera
It typically has like a brief introduction. Okay, these are my favorite things, this is what I worked on. These are interesting links of mine that I have created based on content that I've created, or these are interesting links that I've come across from other sites on the web. So, this is typically how newsletters go, okay? Now due to the nature of a newsletter, okay, it does not help very much with brand recall. Right. It does not help very much for your audience to kind of remember the message of your offer or what you are about because there are so many different links.

[00:08:37.230] - Meera
And when there are so many different links, all right, it is harder for them to kind of understand what action you want them to take. Okay? So, I'm not saying that you should not be sending a newsletter, but newsletters generally, that's the only type of email that you're sending. I would highly suggest switching it up because like I said, it is just very difficult for people to be focused and take the action that you want them to take due to the multiple calls to action that are present within a newsletter.

[00:09:13.410] - Meera
Okay, so a newsletter is not the only type of email. You also have single goal emails, So, single goal emails are an email that is focused on, like I said, one main message or one main goal. Alright, you want them to take one specific action. So that specific action could be, all right, click this link, go read my blog post. Or it could be hit reply to this question. Or it could be take a survey. Or it could be to sign up for a waitlist. Or it could be to sign up for a launch vehicle, which could be a webinar or a workshop or a challenge.

[00:09:50.660] - Meera
Okay? And every single aspect of that email drives towards helping that person take that action. Okay? So, you are creating content within that email to nudge them, to take that specific action. So, those are single goal emails, okay? Now, campaign emails are tied to a larger campaign. It could be a launch campaign, it could be an affiliate campaign. All right. So, campaign emails are a string of emails, all related and all building towards this larger goal.

[00:10:23.490] - Meera
Okay? So, let's say you're having a launch for a mini course. All right. You will have a campaign of maybe seven to ten emails and every single email in that campaign, okay, nudges that subscriber or nudges that ideal client towards taking that final action at the end, which is to perhaps get them interested to sign up for that mini course or to build awareness. So that they have all the information they need to say yes or no to that offer that you're launching.

[00:11:04.120] - Meera
So, what we're trying to do here is determine what is the goal of the email, what is the goal of the campaign, and then focus on the action that you're tracking. So, let me swap back to the slide. If it's a single goal email, you want to determine, okay, what exactly is the action that I want them to take? Like I said, it could be sign up for the waitlist, send in an application, click over here to have a look at this link. All right. That is the action you're tracking, and the content in the email leads to that action. Now, same thing goes for campaign emails, okay? Now, campaign emails is slightly longer in a sense that you have to imagine the type of emails that someone would need in order to say yes to that larger goal at the end of that campaign.

[00:11:52.020] - Meera
So if, let's say, you want someone to have all the information they need in order to say yes or no to the offer you're launching, you need to work back and you need to reverse engineer and figure out. Okay, these are the types of content that I need to be sharing in all the information they need in order to say yes or no to that particular offer or to that particular action. So, when we're talking about reverse engineering, all right, and what is going to support them in the customer journey, what is going to give them all the information they need. So that they can either say yes or no and make an informed decision about your offer. Okay?

[00:12:31.090] - Meera
So, it's not all about saying yes, I want them to buy the offer. It's about helping them make an informed decision. That is what your content has to do. Okay, so when we are talking about that, it's about raising awareness. If they don't even know that there is a problem to be solved, how would they be able to say yes to your offer? So, these are different types of emails that you could potentially share.

[00:12:57.270] - Meera
Why did you create this offer? What is your process? What are the different frameworks or steps? What is your methodology? And how is this different from the other offers that are out there? What are the false beliefs or myths that they may be holding onto that may not necessarily be serving them? Okay. Or how is your take or your perspective different from the others that are out there? Okay. What stories can you share? Is there a client story? Is there your own story? Right now, when it comes to stories, it does not have to be a rags to riches story.

[00:13:32.050] - Meera
And those stories, I honestly really despise those because I feel it's kind of hard to connect to those stories. But when you share client stories, your interaction with people who are just like them, okay, and when there is a takeaway from that, those are the ones that people can really relate to. Okay,what mistakes may they be making? These are the types of emails that will help someone and support them through the customer journey. Now, these are the type of emails that really help to build trust. These are the types of emails that really help your audience see you as someone that they can approach when it comes to the topic of the offer.

[00:14:16.620] - Meera
They also help to build authority. It's not the typical email. These are emails that, yes, may require you to do some digging. All right? They may require you to really dig deep and think about, okay, hey, I have this offer, but how is this different?

[00:14:32.520] - Meera
What am I saying?

[00:14:33.480] - Meera
And how is what I'm saying different from the rest out there? What is my methodology? Okay, when you dig deep and when you share these in your emails, these are the types of emails that will really get your audience to engage with you, to respond back to you. All right?

[00:14:49.930] - Meera
And this is when you will get emails from people saying, you know, hey, I'm really glad I signed up. I never thought of it this way. You really brought, you shared with me a different perspective, something that I never considered before. And when you have people responding in this manner, you know you're on the right track because this is when people want to buy in to your offer. They want to buy into your work and your perspectives. Okay? Now, does a newsletter help you do all of this?

[00:15:21.240] - Meera
Well, like I said, because of the nature of a newsletter, because it has multiple links, it does not allow someone to dive deep into that topic. It does not allow a certain degree of depth because of the multiple calls to action, because of the very format of a newsletter. So, how does this relate to your larger year? So, when you're planning content for the year or for a quarter, specifically when it comes to emails. All right, this is how I would suggest doing it. So that every single email you're sending is intentional. Every single email you're sending is linked to your marketing and business goals. So, you want to take each quarter and you want to figure out, what exactly am I going to do in Jan, Feb, or March?

[00:16:12.790] - Meera
Okay. This could be perhaps, it could be having one promotion or having three specific mini projects that you're launching. Okay? Now based on that, you want to reverse engineer and figure out. All right. So, let's say in February, you're going to be launching a book, or you're going to be launching a mini course. Then you want to say, okay, what are the types of emails I need to be sending my email list to prime them for this launch? Okay, what are the different messages that they need to be hearing from me, so that they are prepared to take action, or they have all the information they need and they are aware, so that they can take action.

[00:16:56.470] - Meera
So, this is how you would reverse engineer and determine the type of emails that you would be sending out. Now, what if you have no products when you're starting out? So, let's say you have no offers right now. So, in that case, how can you get intentional with the type of emails you're sending. You can still do so. All right, you can still get very intentional. And this is exactly what I did when I started out. And I was very new to business.

[00:17:22.090] - Meera
You know, I didn't have any offers at all. I created authority building campaign. So, I wanted to be known for certain things or certain messages, and all my emails were centered around those messages. And when I did it in that way, it really helped to build trust and it helped to build authority. Okay. Or if you are thinking of creating an offer, it could be a service, it could be a coaching offer, or it could even be a digital product. You could create emails around building an interest list. So, your goal or the action that you want them to take would be to sign up for the interest list. And all the emails that you're creating is set up to build awareness, is set up to support them to take that action.

[00:18:05.280] - Meera
Okay, then obviously we spoke about launch campaigns. You could also do the same with affiliate campaigns. So, it doesn't have to be your own offer. It could be someone else's offer that you're promoting. But the same thing goes. You still need to create content to support them, okay, and to provide them with the information they need in order to say yes or no to that action.

[00:18:26.910] - Meera
So, you want to reverse engineer and figure out what your audience needs to know or what your audience needs to believe in order to be able to take that action. Now, is it easy to do all of this with a newsletter? Like I said, because of the nature of the newsletter, it has multiple calls to action. It is difficult to keep your subscribers focus on the main message or the main action that you want them to take or that you want them to recall.

[00:18:58.020] - Meera
So, I would suggest using newsletters between campaigns. Okay, so let's say, you've launched something and then you have your next promotion or your next offer a couple of weeks later. Okay. You've got a space in between, and this is where you can use a newsletter. But if a newsletter is the only type of email that you're sending, I would highly suggest trying these other types of emails. Okay, so let me just stop to share right now.

[00:19:27.670] - Meera
I hope today's session got you thinking about the type of emails you're sending to your email list. Maybe it gave you a burst of inspiration about the different types of emails that you could possibly be sending out as well. If you want to dive deeper into the topic of emails, I do have a free email course. It's called Email List for Newbies and you can access that at this short link meera.email/course.

[00:19:51.870] - Meera
Okay, so if emails on your radar, this is one of the first few resources that I would suggest you check out. The other one would be my book on Amazon called 300 Email Marketing Tips. So, I look forward to taking this conversation forward and connecting with you via email and I hope you enjoy the rest of your summit. Bye.
