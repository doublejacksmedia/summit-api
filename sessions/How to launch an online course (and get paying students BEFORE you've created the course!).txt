Transcript:
[00:00:09.450] - Liz Stapleton, Summit Host
I'm super excited for today's session with Gemma Bonham Carter, hopefully I said that, right? Yeah! Welcome, because we're going to be talking about launching a course, before you create it and selling it before you create it? I think?

[00:00:22.260] - Gemma Bonham Carter, gemmabonhamcarter.com
Yes.

[00:00:22.440] - Liz
Which is kind of mind blowing if you really hadn't thought about it that way. I think most people think of creating the course and then trying to sell it. So can you tell us just a little bit about your background, how you came up with this and then we'll get going?

[00:00:39.270] - Gemma
Yeah, for sure. So I won't I won't bore you with too much background about me. But I do want to mention that I actually got started as a blogger back in 2010.

[00:00:48.450] - Gemma
That was my first foray into the online space, was writing a home decor blog that I actually still manage to this day called,  The Sweetest Digs.

[00:00:59.100] - Liz
Well, your background looks lovely, so...

[00:00:59.610] - Gemma
Oh, thanks.  

[00:01:05.580] - Gemma
So I actually still manage that blog, although not as actively as I once did. And in 2016, I made a bit of a shift to doing more business consulting, helping new entrepreneurs get their online businesses going. And I was getting actually initially a lot of questions from other bloggers about what I had done because I'd grown my blog by that point to be like a relatively lucrative business. And so I launched a course and it was for bloggers in the beginning, and I've since launched lots of different programs.

[00:01:44.010] - Gemma
And that was really a pivotal turning point for me because I didn't really understand at that time the power of online courses and digital programs and products and really that model of doing business. And so for me, the gate swung wide open. I fell deep in love with online courses have since built this business coaching business of mine over at GemmaBonhamCarter.com, where really I do some one to one client work still, like coaching, but the vast majority of my revenue through that business comes from online courses and digital products.

[00:02:22.710] - Gemma
So that's kind of my background in a nutshell.

[00:02:25.110] - Liz
OK, got it. So how, if you haven't created the course, how do you sell it? Let's start there, kind of as an overview, we'll dive deeper into kind of the details. But like, how do you sell something that doesn't exist?

[00:02:37.590] - Gemma
Yeah, so that's it. So let's like, I'll zoom out for a sec, before I'm sure we can get into more specific strategies. But the idea behind what we like to call pre selling is that it's all well and good to think, oK, I'm going to go create a course about this thing that I really love talking about and teaching. But you don't actually know if people are going to be interested in paying to learn about that thing. You might think it's the best idea in the world...

[00:03:11.130] - Gemma
Your audience might have zero interest, and sometimes it's hard for us to really be in the shoes of our audience and really understand where they're willing to part with dollars. Right. And actually invest in a course or a program. So the idea with pre selling is that before you've gone and recorded videos and made workbooks and invested in an online course platform and all of those things, if you can do really proper validation of your idea in the form of pre selling, you can feel so much more confident about now spending the time in creating that program.

[00:03:11.130] - Gemma
And so. With market validation, like one of the things that a lot of people seem to do is they think, OK, I'm going to get beta testers and I'm going to get people to beta test my program. And that's all well and fine. And beta testers might give you some great testimonials or something like that or point out some things that you might have...

[00:04:12.520] - Liz
Gaps that you didn't realize were there.

[00:04:14.140] - Gemma
Exactly. But it's not true market validation unless somebody is paying money for that product because anyone will be a beta tester, like you're going to give me something for free?

[00:04:24.850] - Liz
But paid beta testers is a whole different ball game.

[00:04:26.560] - Gemma
Yeah. But if you can get people paying for that, for that program, then that's really, you're really then able to say, OK, I actually have something here.

[00:04:37.060] - Gemma
People are actually willing to pay money to learn about this topic. So let me go further and actually create this program. And so with pre selling, you're going to, you're going to have crafted what I like to call an offer prototype. So you have your course offer all mapped out. You know exactly what each module and lesson would look like. You know, the workbooks that are going with it. You know, what bonuses would be included, how you're going to deliver it.

[00:05:00.040] - Gemma
All of that is mapped out ahead of time. But then you're, you're not going and creating it. You've crafted that offer, and then you're going to put it out to your audience and say, OK, here's what this is going to look like. Here's the sort of you want to be realistic about the schedule. Like this is going to be a course that's dripped over eight weeks so that you can stay on top of delivering the content in a way that's going to work for you.

[00:05:24.010] - Gemma
And you can kind of maybe be a week or two ahead so that you're not feeling too stressed and and launch it and do a launch and get people to, you know, get your, whether that's like social media, via email marketing, using webinars, like whatever it might be, and have a sales page and get people to purchase. Knowing that the course starts on October 1st, November 1st, January 1st, whenever that start date is, and you actually run through it with the first time with those founding students, almost like in a live way, like you can prerecord all the stuff and drip it out.

[00:05:58.430] - Gemma
But it's kind of like....

[00:05:59.560] - Liz
You can answer questions.

[00:06:00.880] - Gemma
Exactly.

[00:06:01.810] - Gemma
And that's really like the zoomed out version of why you want to presell, because how good is it going to feel to get 10, 20, 30 students to pay you to create that program that you kind of have an idea around? And then when you've come to the end of creation, you've gone through it with your first group of founding students. You've got some great testimonials there. Now you can package it up, launch it again, rinse and repeat your launch and just keep making sales over and over and over without having to go and create new lessons or new workbooks or whatever.

[00:06:33.820] - Liz
And you might add a bonus here and there. Sure. But...

[00:06:36.130] - Gemma
Exactly.

[00:06:37.150] - Liz
So from a timeline standpoint, how far from sort of the end of your launch or cart close would you recommend the start date be?

[00:06:46.630] - Gemma
Probably, I would say. You know, give yourself a solid week or two to recover from your launch before starting, and I wouldn't go any longer than three to four weeks out, like I can't really see people wanting....

[00:07:02.400] - Liz
They aren't going to be as pumped up a month later.

[00:07:04.740] - Gemma
Yeah, if you leave it too long, you're just losing that momentum. I also get worried that you might have some people maybe asking for a refund because you've kind of left it too long and they're second guessing the investment.

[00:07:17.010] - Liz
So it might be like during your launch, once you get the first few sales, start working on less than one so that you can get a little bit ahead.

[00:07:23.550] - Gemma
Totally.

[00:07:24.390] - Liz
OK, got it.

[00:07:26.250] - Gemma
And actually, I should say, because I get this question a lot, people say, "well, what happens if I only sell like two spots? Do I have to then carry it out and deliver on it? If I really didn't get the numbers I was hoping for?" And there's a couple of things to think about before we make a decision. One thing is like, well, how big is your audience? Like if you have an audience that's five thousand ten thousand people and you made two sales.

[00:07:52.710] - Gemma
Yeah. That conversion rate's bad, we're not going to go ahead and like, see this through because it's just the idea hasn't been proven well enough.

[00:08:01.110] - Gemma
But if you have an audience of like 20 people on your email list and you got two sales, that's actually a really decent conversion rate and you should probably run with that and then also concentrate on growing your audience and growing your email list. Right. And maybe do them in tandem. So to if it was option A, where you have a big audience and you only made a couple of sales, honestly, it's not that big of a deal to just give people a refund and just say, thank you so much for purchasing. I really appreciate it. Unfortunately, we didn't get the volume we were expecting for this round. So we are going to go ahead and give you a full refund." You can be extra nice and be like, here's a, here's like an extra downloadable that we have that we just wanted to send your way as a thank you, you know, just like kill them with kindness and nobody's going to care. Like you're the only one who feels any kind of way about that.

[00:08:52.980] - Gemma
They're going to be like, oh, OK. Well,

[00:08:54.900] - Liz
Yeah, I think the sort of the impression you leave with them is you're open and honest and you take care of your, your customers and your people. So when down the road they're going to feel good purchasing with you again.

[00:09:04.350] - Gemma
Exactly.

[00:09:05.700] - Liz
Yeah. OK, so that actually was one of my questions. So thank you for answering it. OK, so I know you said you have specific strategies. You suggest when when launching, a pre selling a course. Do you want to dive into those?

[00:09:25.080] - Gemma
Sure, yeah. So I have a couple, three main ones that I usually talk to my students about. The first one is a little different.

[00:09:35.580] - Gemma
So the first one is actually using a paid live workshop.

[00:09:40.290] - Gemma
And the reason why we do this is it's almost like we are testing the waters on whether people are interested in learning about a given topic. And we're doing it in a much smaller scale with a live workshop that's actually paid. So let's say you want to create I'll give you an example. Actually, I worked with a client. She is also in kind of the the entrepreneurship space. And she's really an expert at Instagram, social media, and sort of sales.

[00:10:10.050] - Gemma
So but she thought, OK, well, I don't I've never had a course before. I don't know if people are actually interested in learning from me about this. And I said, well, why don't we test the waters with three different paid live workshops? And so you can offer it on three different topics, all within the her general niche, get a sense of what are people willing to like? Maybe there is going to be one that's like really well attended and that's going to give you a clue as to what your course should be about.

[00:10:38.220] - Gemma
Maybe none of them will be well attended at all. And we'll need to go back to the drawing board and rework this and figure out actually what your audience wants to buy from you. And so she came up with three different topics. She put them out there.

[00:10:52.260] - Gemma
She got a giant response, made thousands and thousands of dollars actually just from these workshops. And then was, that gave her real validation to then say, OK, now I am going to go ahead and put this course together and launch it. And she did and had huge success with that, too. So a paid live workshop is something that not a lot of entrepreneurs use and I think is a really, really great strategy. So that's strategy number one.

[00:11:16.770] - Gemma
Strategy number two is your typical webinar. And maybe you're sitting there and you're like, oh, I hate webinars, but I'm going to just tell you, webinars are still working. And they work, like they really work. And I think there is so much value in a webinar for a few reasons because it does so many things in one kind of 60 minute container, it can build relationship and trust with the people who are watching. You can have, create incredible rapport on a webinar in that time and share a bit of your own story and build your own expert status and credibility.

[00:11:54.450] - Gemma
You can teach them stuff and so that they're like really learning from you. And they are going to walk away from that webinar, having really learned something, have some aha moments, that kind of thing, and get a sense of OK, like she's actually pretty good at teaching about this and I really liked learning from her. And ultimately you can pitch your product and really tell people exactly what it is. And in the case of a presale, you're telling them this is a founding student launch, you're going to get in at the best price it'll ever be.

[00:12:22.590] - Gemma
We're offering it for 50 percent off for our first students who enroll and tell them exactly what's going to be included, how it's going to roll out all of that kind of stuff so you can do all of those things in that 60 minute container of a webinar. And even if people don't purchase on the webinar, you've grown your email list. You really have continued to build your your credibility in your niche. And they just it does all kinds of good things for you and your, your audience.

[00:12:48.960] - Gemma
So I love webinars. I don't think they're going anywhere anytime soon. Just maybe don't don't be like slimey in your webinar is all I can say. Right.

[00:13:00.270] - Liz
And be authentic. Be honest. If you're nervous, be like I'm a little nervous. I've never done this, you know, like, that's fine.

[00:13:06.570] - Gemma
Yes. The more authentic and vulnerable you can be, crack jokes that you think are funny, like whatever, do like, really let your personality shine through. If you can do all that, you're really going to get the right kind of students in your program. So a webinar is something that I really try to encourage all of my clients and students to do. They're always nervous to do their first one. It always goes better than they think it's going to go.

[00:13:31.920] - Gemma
And they're always actually like, so shocked when they get their first sales running in from that webinar. So that's the second strategy. And then the third strategy. We're getting really simple here. It's like one to one conversations. And so if you put out. Whether it is a Facebook live video or an Instagram story or an email to your email list and you say basically, listen, I'm creating this program, it's going to be about this. It's going to solve this problem for you.

[00:14:06.030] - Gemma
We're going to start running it on January 1st, if you're interested, book a sales call, like book a call, a discovery call, whatever you want to call it.

[00:14:15.930] - Gemma
Either either. Actually, if you don't even want to do a call thing, you can say you can at least get them to respond to the email or get into your direct messages and have a conversation that way about it. I'm in my direct messages a lot doing like voice notes with people. I often just respond that way and then we can have a conversation. I can answer any questions they might have about my program. And then there's so much more trusting and ready to hop in because they've had that interaction with me.

[00:14:40.650] - Gemma
They know I'm a real person, I'm not a scam artist, and they're now excited to work with me. But really, it's just those one to one conversations. And the nice thing about booking the call of that 15 minute or 30 minute call is whether it's a call or the D.M. You just really need to do more listening than talking. And you really need to understand, is that person, like what are their goals? What are they struggling with?

[00:15:06.990] - Gemma
Where do they ultimately want to end up?

[00:15:09.270] - Gemma
And if your program is going to be the right fit for them, then you make the offer and just say give the scoop of what it's all about. You don't need to be super pressure-y or salesy. If they feel like it's the right fit, they're going to hop in.

[00:15:21.940] - Liz
Yeah, and you can always be like, you know, I don't think this is the right fit for you.

[00:15:25.250] - Gemma
Absolutely.

[00:15:26.100] - Liz
Check this out of mine or something.

[00:15:28.290] - Gemma
Yes.

[00:15:29.550] - Liz
From having a background in sales, the more the "prospect", if you want to use sales lingo is talking, the better off you are. You want to ask open ended questions, really hear their struggles and listen and respond. If you're spending all the time talking it's not going well.

[00:15:44.340] - Gemma
Exactly. And you can actually. So those three strategies we talked about were a paid leave workshop, a webinar and one to one conversations. You can combine those, right. Like you could do a webinar and also have one to one conversations. Have both avenues open during your launch to ultimately fill your program for that first round.

[00:16:04.500] - Liz
Yes. So I love those ideas. I think you're right, I don't see a lot of paid live workshops. Webinars have been around and one on one. But so I have a question because all those are great.

[00:16:17.730] - Liz
And the idea of preselling is you're not investing a ton of time and work into something that doesn't work out?

[00:16:22.230] - Gemma
Correct.

[00:16:22.770] - Liz
But chances are you need to invest in some tools to make any of these launches possible. So would you say is worth investing in a pre sale launch?

[00:16:33.810] - Gemma
So in terms of tools like, OK, so you need a sales page, which means you need to build out a landing page on some software.

[00:16:42.660] - Gemma
So whether that is WordPress, Squarespace Wix show it.

[00:16:46.800] - Gemma
But actually you can even just do it on Canva. Like Canva allows you to publish now to a website so you can actually create a free website on Canva so you can have a sales page. That way, if you don't have a checkout software, you can do a PayPal buy button like you can just if you have a PayPal account, you can create a button that says buy here and put the amount of dollars on it and it just goes through PayPal so we can get really simple with that too.

[00:17:13.920] - Gemma
You, if you want to host a webinar, yes, you do need like some sort of casting software. I use something called webinar jam, which does it does cost several hundred dollars a year for that. But you could use a platform like Zoom, you could use a platform like Google meet. If you want to get really basic, you could just live stream on Facebook.

[00:17:36.030] - Liz
Yeah. I've heard that. Yeah.

[00:17:37.530] - Gemma
Right. So there's I think, whenever we talk about tech.

[00:17:42.510] - Liz
Livestream YouTube too, same idea.

[00:17:44.160] - Gemma
Yeah, exactly. So whenever we talk about tech I find there's like a spectrum of like scrappy and pro and like you can go wherever you want on that spectrum.

[00:17:53.300] - Liz
If this is your first launch and you have no budget go scrappy.

[00:17:56.640] - Gemma
Exactly. And like emails, your probably, you're going to need an email marketing platform.

[00:18:00.990] - Gemma
Again, a lot of those email marketing platforms for the first thousand subscribers are free, like Mailer Lite.

[00:18:07.590] - Gemma
MailChimp, I'm pretty sure Convertkit has a free plan now so you can get going without having invested much money. And I really think that there is an ability to be scrappy here. And in my opinion is that bloggers tend to be some of the scrappiest around. And can really make it work without getting the most bells and whistles software out there. So it's possible and it actually takes, I think, less than what we anticipate it will.

[00:18:39.810] - Liz
Yeah.

[00:18:40.080] - Gemma
And from it actually from a delivery point of view of a course, you're right. Like once you get people enrolled, you are going to have to deliver the program, but again, if we don't want to invest in any online core software, you could theoretically just have a Facebook group for your community aspect of it and then create content on a Google drive and share it that way or in a Dropbox.

[00:19:03.870] - Liz
I think the blogging course I took was completely by email. Like eventually, they like did like a full video stuff.

[00:19:10.100] - Liz
It was like her first launch in this in the niche after. And I was like, and that course is still for way more than I have access to everything, which is great. But...

[00:19:18.650] - Gemma
Exactly.

[00:19:19.730] - Liz
It was these like 20 page emails and I would print them out and I would go through like 2014, 2015 or something.

[00:19:26.360] - Gemma
Yeah.

[00:19:26.960] - Liz
And yeah. Yeah. So you can always start there too.

[00:19:30.680] - Gemma
You can always start there.

[00:19:31.760] - Liz
Setting the expectation. So have an idea probably of how you're going to deliver so that you can set the expectation for them of what they can, you know how they're going to receive it.

[00:19:40.350] - Liz
Exactly. But yeah it's like that, I just love that story. And you know a) that was like her being scrappy b) you didn't mind at all receiving it that way, like you still feel, like you still got value out of the course. And C) you've just proven my point about how valuable being a founding student is, because you get it for the best price and then you're always grandfathered in and get all the stuff as it evolves.

[00:20:08.480] - Liz
Yeah, it's like a $1000 course now or something I got for like a hundred fifty bucks.

[00:20:12.080] - Gemma
Exactly. And so if you as the person who is like launching their first course can make sure that people realize like that's part of the messaging and the marketing when we're doing a founding launch is to really say like you're going to get this at the best rate ever and get lifetime access and grandfathered into any future updates that come with this program. And that can really incentivize. I love being a founding student. Any time anybody launches something who, like, is somebody that I trust and it's something I want to learn about, you better believe I'm hopping in as the founding student.

[00:20:46.160] - Liz
Yeah, yeah. I mean, so it was, I mean, it was my first blogging course. It seemed like a huge investment at the time, wasn't making any money on my blog. And it was I mean it completely turned. I now have been self employed online for years and never would have happened if I hadn't started with that first course. So recognize the impact you can have on your students lives too.

[00:21:07.070] - Gemma
Absolutely

[00:21:07.140] - Liz
Because sometimes you just worry that they're not going to like it, but you don't realize how much you can help.

[00:21:12.900] - Liz
I was like, OK, so my next question is because you haven't created how do you decide on the pricing, whether it's for the live workshop or for the presell? 

[00:21:22.850] - Gemma
A really good question. And it's a tricky one because it's unfortunately not one of those things where I can give a formula, you know, like there isn't a cut and dry formula that I can give you where you can plug in some numbers and come out with your perfect price.

[00:21:36.950] - Gemma
That is going to just like always hit it on the nail every time. So it is a bit of an art and a science. I will say it. The three niches that typically we see can charge probably the higher price tags are if you are in the niches of health, wealth and relationships, those tend to be if you think about, like an online course or a workshop or really any kind of digital product, it's solving a problem for somebody.

[00:22:07.280] - Gemma
It is. It is the solution to a pain point. And how deep that pain point is felt is correlated with how much they will spend to fix that pain point, to fix that problem. And so if I am a brand new real estate agent and I need to learn how to land clients using social media because cold calling and door knocking isn't what we do these days. And I don't know how to land clients. And my livelihood depends on me landing clients.

[00:22:41.240] - Gemma
You better believe I'm going to be ready to invest a thousand bucks in a program that's going to teach me how to do that, because I know a) it's a really deep pain point for me and b) the return on my investment is going to be really good. As another example, if I'm somebody who is, I don't know, I'm home schooling my kids right now and I want to do art lessons with them on a weekly basis, I, that's a pain point that I want to solve.

[00:23:12.820] - Gemma
I want to have some...

[00:23:13.620] - Liz
Don't want to be on Pinterest every single week.

[00:23:14.860] - Gemma
That's right. I want to have some kind of like created easy to deliver and manage art lessons for my kids once a week. I'm willing to spend some money to solve that pain point. However, I'm not going to be spending a thousand dollars because it's not as deeply felt as health, wealth or relationship type pain points would feel. I'm also not necessarily, I'm getting a return in terms of I'm getting a return on my time because I don't want to waste my time looking for this and my frustration.

[00:23:48.280] - Gemma
But I'm not necessarily getting a return in terms of money. I'm not necessarily making more money or saving more money. So that would play into the pricing of that particular program. So you would want that one to be like that water, lets say it's watercolor painting or whatever art it is for kids, like it would need to be a bit lower. I'm probably not going to spend a thousand bucks. Right. This is going to need to be a much lower price point.

[00:24:10.030] - Gemma
And so you kind of need to look at your own program, figure out, OK, what is the problem that I'm ultimately solving with this? How deeply felt is that pain point? Is my customer able to make money or save money by taking my program? If not, like, what are the other things? Are they saving time, frustration, all of those types of things? And then you're just going to need to do some testing in the marketplace.

[00:24:37.270] - Gemma
And typically with that first launch, it's going to be the cheapest it's ever going to be. So don't freak out about, you know that you can't ever put it up.

[00:24:47.320] - Gemma
You know, if you have an idea that eventually you want this course to be 197 or 297 or five hundred dollars or whatever, you can start halfway to that point and know that you can increase it over time. You're not set in stone.

[00:25:02.440] - Liz
Yeah. So do you kind of apply that same logic when determining the pricing for the paid live launch, or paid live workshop or is that kind of, is there a sort of range that those fall into?

[00:25:13.300] - Gemma
Yeah, no, it's definitely the same.

[00:25:15.770] - Gemma
You ask yourself the same questions, you know, similarly, like if you were delivering a workshop for real estate agents, you can imagine like a two hour live workshop where they also get to walk away with some, I don't know, templates or swipe files or things like that. Like you could be charging at least several hundred dollars for that. If I'm doing a two hour watercolor workshop about how to paint peonies, I'm probably going to be charging forty seven bucks.

[00:25:45.140] - Liz
Yeah.

[00:25:45.450] - Gemma
Right? Like, it's just it's not going to be in the same arena for the, all of those same reasons. And typically with workshops, I like it to be anywhere from like I probably wouldn't go any lower than something like a $37, $47 as my absolute base level for something like a two hour workshop. And when I say workshops I always like to there's extras that come with it too like things that they can take home with them or download or whatever all the way up to.

[00:26:14.920] - Gemma
Yeah. Hundreds of dollars for that, for that live workshop.

[00:26:18.880] - Liz
OK, I know we're starting to run out of time. So let me just so let's kind of talk about, make sure, I think we've mostly answered my questions. This can really be done for any course level, whether it's $27. $47. $997.

[00:26:35.530] - Gemma
Yeah.

[00:26:37.120] - Liz
And we talked about testing to figure out the subject. So step by step is, is come up with an idea, figure out how you're going to test, whether it's going to be with a paid live workshop or webinar or just one on one conversations with your email list, surveys.

[00:26:54.160] - Liz
However you want to do that, figure out which one is really speaking to people and then work on prepping a launch, which means sales page, simple check out. You can be scrappy, mechanics. I'm like took notes. So I'm like...  be scrappy. Sell it. But a launch is going to be launch emails too, you need to focus on that. You need some, some graphics, some mockups probably social media, Canva is great for that Canva can be like you said, your sales page.

[00:27:21.490] - Liz
I may use it for that. I'm learning a lot about Canva this year with various Summit sessions I'm doing. I was like, oh, I didn't know it could do that.

[00:27:28.570] - Gemma
Oh my gosh. Canava is like my

[00:27:31.300] - Liz
Yeah, I have a love hate relationship with Canva there's a lot of things I love about it and a lot of things I'm like ugh.

[00:27:34.540] - Gemma
I'm all love.

[00:27:40.210] - Liz
But I stopped using them for like a year and then I was like, oh well I can do that now.

[00:27:44.680] - Gemma
Yeah, they added a lot of features.

[00:27:47.060] - Liz
Yeah. Anyway, back to prepping. Do the launch once you've got a good number of sales, it looks like the conversion rate is meeting your expectations. Start working on that first lesson to deliver a couple weeks after your cart close, kind of go from there? Is that kind of step by step what we said to presell your course?

[00:28:07.840] - Gemma
You totally nailed it.

[00:28:09.760] - Liz
Is there anything I missed that they would need for their launch? Besides, I mean,

[00:28:13.950] - Gemma
A launch can look a lot of different ways. When I work with my students, I kind of layout a smorgasbord of like, these are all the things that you can do in a launch. And I think it's best to pick and choose the things that feel right for you and resonate with how you want to show up. I'm not going to tell you to go and do a live series in a free Facebook group if that's not what resonates with you.

[00:28:38.110] - Gemma
Right. Like maybe you're much better at just sticking with email writing and Instagram or something like that. So we talk about different different things that can take place during your launch. But ultimately the big goal is get really visible, talk to your audience and drive people to the sales page is like those are the big goals.

[00:28:58.210] - Liz
All right. Awesome. Thank you so much, Gemma. I really appreciate you being part of the Summit. I know you have something for attendees. Do you want to tell them about it. And the link is below, I think, to the right, if I remember correctly.

[00:29:10.510] - Gemma
Yeah. So if if you want to learn more about how to effectively create a course that sells, I do have a free 60 minute master class that is, you can sign up for and watch it on your own time and you can head on over to gemmabonhamcarter.com/course-class . I go more into pre selling. We talk about like what makes a really irresistible online course offer and all sorts of other nitty gritty behind the scenes strategies that I like to share.

[00:29:39.880] - Gemma
And I tell you a little bit more about my story, too, so you can head on over to that link to sign up for that free class. And actually, I should also mention, because we talked about the paid live workshops, I have a brand new actually product at gemmabonhamcarter.com/workshop-wins  that talks a lot more about how to effectively create those paid live workshops and use them as either a test for your bigger online course or just a strategy to layer in some additional revenue into your business.

[00:30:13.090] - Gemma
So that's I'm really excited about that one, too.

[00:30:15.580] - Liz
Yeah, that sounds like I'm going to check that out, guys. Definitely go check those links out. And again, thank you so much for joining us. I hope you have a great, wonderful rest of your day.
