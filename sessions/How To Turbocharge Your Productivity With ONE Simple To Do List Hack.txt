Hi, I'm Eb Gargano from Productive Blogging and I am delighted to be speaking again at the Blogger Breakthrough Summit. This year, I'm talking about how to turbocharge your productivity with one simple to do list hack. Let's dive in, shall we? So, for those of you who don't know me, my name is Ed Pegano and I am the blogger behind Easypeasyfoody and Productivelogging.com. I have been blogging since 2015 and in that time my blogs have been read by over 18 million people around the world.

[00:00:50.260] - Eb Gargano
I've launched five successful online blogging courses with over 2000 students enrolled. I've published four ebooks. I also run two Facebook groups and I manage to publish six to eight blog posts per month. Plus send out six to eight blog newsletters per month as well as keep on top of two inboxes and nine social media accounts. And I make a comfortable six figure income.

[00:01:17.160] - Eb Gargano
And yet I work pretty much Monday to Friday and nine to five. I take time off during my kids school holidays and I take most weekends off. And I also take a random midweek days off pretty much whenever I want to. I do outsource a couple of things, but over 90% is done by me. I don't have a large team supporting me, I'm a solopreneur.

[00:01:45.660] - Eb Gargano
And people always ask me how? How do you do it? How do you get so much done? How do you achieve so much and yet still have a life? How are you so productive?

[00:01:59.640] - Eb Gargano
Well, that is what this session is all about. In this session I'm going to be sharing with you an amazing to do this hack that has literally transformed my life. No word of a lie. This hack has made me even more productive. It's helped me to earn a lot more from my blog, it's massively improved my work life balance and it's massively reduced my stress levels too.

[00:02:29.590] - Eb Gargano
And the best thing about this to do list hack is it is super simple and free. There's no need for any complicated or expensive software. But before we dive into exactly what this hack is, I want to ask you if you identify with any or all of the following statements I'm not earning enough money from my blog. I feel like I never have enough time to do everything I want to do on my blog. I feel stressed and overwhelmed by everything I have to do.

[00:03:07.990] - Eb Gargano
Blogging is no fun anymore. Let me know which of these you identify with in the chat. As you know, this presentation is pre recorded so that I can be in the chat with you in real time, interacting with you and answering your questions as we go. So feel free to ask any and all questions that you have during this presentation. Okay, so the good news is if you have identified with any of these questions, you are in the right place.

[00:03:38.040] - Eb Gargano
Because this simple and free todo list hack will help with all of those things. But before I tell you what the todo list hack is, it's really important that you understand what the problem is. The real problem. The real reason why you are feeling overworked and underpaid, the real reason why you feel like you never have enough time, the real reason why you are feeling stressed and overwhelmed by all the things you feel you should be doing. You see, there's a basic principle that we all have a finite amount of time to spend on our blogs.

[00:04:19.090] - Eb Gargano
Now, some of you will obviously have more time than others, but no matter who you are, no one has more than 168 hours in a week. Even if you are the richest person on earth, you cannot buy more time. Time is finite. So given that you only have a finite amount of time for your blog, whether for you that's ten or 100 hours a week, it makes logical sense that you should spend those hours on the highest impact tasks. In other words, you should spend your time on the tasks that will move the dial the most, the tasks that will make the biggest difference to your bottom line, the tasks that will help you achieve your goals in the shortest amount of time.

[00:05:13.620] - Eb Gargano
The problem is, most people do the exact opposite without even realizing it. I've been working with bloggers now for over five years. I've helped hundreds of bloggers become more productive, more successful, and build more profitable online businesses. And time and time again, I SEO the exact same problem. Those high impact tasks are the ones that never get done.

[00:05:43.460] - Eb Gargano
They're the ones that languish at the bottom of a to do list. They're the tasks that keep getting put off and put off and put off until some mythical one day in the future that never happens. And instead, the tasks that do get done are the less impactful tasks, the tasks that only move the dial a very small amount, and the tasks that don't move the dial at all. And the reason? The reason is your todo list is not fit for purpose.

[00:06:21.880] - Eb Gargano
You see, most bloggers I encounter fall into one of four groups when it comes to to do lists. Cap number one is they don't even have a to do list. It's all in their heads. Cap number two, they have a very, very, very long list of everything they feel they ought to do, everything they see other bloggers doing, and everything someone once said on a webinar that they should be doing. Camp number three is a combination of one and two, a very long list of everything and a bunch of stuff in your head.

[00:07:04.680] - Eb Gargano
And camp number four, they have some fancy software that's so complicated to use that most of the time they end up resorting to writing stuff on bits of paper and or keeping it in. Let's I'd love to know which camp you feel you fit into or is there a camp I've missed? Either way, let me know in the text. So no matter which camp you are in, your to do list is the problem. Your to do list is not helping you.

[00:07:35.220] - Eb Gargano
In fact, your todo list is holding you back. Because you see, todo lists were not created equally. A good todo list is your ticket to greater productivity, less stress, better results and ultimately achieving your goals. A bad to do list is the exact opposite. It reduces productivity, it creates stress and it doesn't help you see results or achieve your goals.

[00:08:06.260] - Eb Gargano
So what's the solution? Many people look at this problem and conclude that the whole notion of a todo list is the problem and so they throw the baby out with wash water and get rid of to do list entirely. I think that's a mistake because actually done right, a to do list can be a very powerful tool. A good todo list can help you earn more, help you get a much better work life balance and reduce your stress levels and feelings of overwhelm. So the solution is not to throw the whole concept of to do list out altogether, but rather use a better, more effective todo list.

[00:08:55.570] - Eb Gargano
A todo list that helps you identify your most impactful tasks and plan your time out in a way that will ensure you actually do your most impactful tasks and don't get sidetracked by busy work, nice but not necessary tasks, time wasters and shiny objects. My to do list Hack my effective to do list does not require any fancy, complicated, expensive software. It is in essence just a simple spreadsheet. Well, it looks very simple and it's very simple to use, but it is when years properly insanely powerful. In fact, when I first figure this hack out it totally transforms my productivity and I was already a very productive person.

[00:09:50.710] - Eb Gargano
But this hack took me to the next level and it's so powerful and so effective precisely because it's so simple. Because the thing is, if a system is complicated, then you won't end up using it and you'll resort back to keeping everything in your head or on that long, long list, or on those scrappy bits of paper. Or was it that has ever happened to you? Let me know in the chat if you've ever done that. If you've ever tried a complicated todo list system and then ended up not using it because it was so complicated and gone back to your old ways of doing things.

[00:10:29.440] - Eb Gargano
Well, the good news is that won't be a problem with this method done right, this todo list hack will help you make more money while working less, but it will also massively reduce your stress levels and feelings of overwhelm. And better still, it will make blogging fun again. What is it EV? I hear you cry. Okay.

[00:10:53.970] - Eb Gargano
Introducing the yearly action plan. I wish I could have thought up a fancier name for this, but I couldn't. So yearly action plan is what it is. If you can think of a better name for this spreadsheet, please do let me know in the chat. The Yearly Action Plan is just a super simple spreadsheet with 16 taps.

[00:11:16.390] - Eb Gargano
Don't worry if you're not a spreadsheet wiz. There are no complicated formulas. It is all just text. So the first tab is called Goals. On this tab you're going to write your big picture goals.

[00:11:35.060] - Eb Gargano
What do you really want from your blog? Why are you doing this rather than anything else you could be doing with your time? Why are you doing this rather than any other way of making money? Now, this talk isn't about goal setting, so I'm not going to go deep into goal setting right now. But this part is really important because until you get crystal clear on your big picture goals, you cannot be truly productive because you don't know what you're aiming for.

[00:12:10.290] - Eb Gargano
So if you're not clear on your goals, you will always feel overwhelmed and overworked and stressed and scattered because you don't have a clear idea about where you want to be. So this is going to look different to different people, but for most people, it will look like some combination of the following. Number one, earn a good income. You would obviously need to define what a good income means for you. Number two, have a good work life balance.

[00:12:48.270] - Eb Gargano
Most bloggers and online business owners I come across want to work less and want to be able to work more flexibly and have more control over their time. Again, you would need to define exactly what this looks like for you. Number three, enjoy what you do. There are many ways to earn money in this world. Most bloggers and online business owners do what they do because they want to spend their days doing a job they enjoy.

[00:13:18.790] - Eb Gargano
Number four, have a positive influence on a specific group of people. Again, for most bloggers, part of the motivation is about making a difference and having an impact. This part is really, really important. Please do not skip it because this is the yardstick by which you will evaluate all the possible tasks you could do, all the possible ways you could spend your time, and decide which activities will help you achieve your goals the best. And obviously, you will want to be a little more specific here than I've been.

[00:13:56.470] - Eb Gargano
And in fact, if you sign up for my freebie, which I'll be telling you about later, that will help you out with this part. Okay. So, the next tab is called the brain dump tab. Here is where I want you to put everything that's on your current to do list, everything that's on those scrappy bits of paper and everything that is in your brain, every task you feel you ought to be doing, I want you to put everything here. Don't leave anything out.

[00:14:27.860] - Eb Gargano
This is also really important because one of the reasons for feeling overwhelmed and scattered and stressed is because there's stuff all over the place, in your brain, on to do this, in some app somewhere, on scrappy bits of paper. Getting everything down in one place should be really cathartic and it's an absolute prerequisite for the next step. Okay. So, the next step is to reread your goals and then take a look at that great long list of everything and ask yourself, which are the tasks that are going to move the dial the most? Which are the activities and actions that are going to give me the most bang for my buck?

[00:15:11.820] - Eb Gargano
Which things are going to get me to my goals the best, the fastest? And this is really important, which things are going to get me to my goals in the most enjoyable way? Because I promised that this process would make blogging fun again. And that is part of the decision making here.

[00:15:30.610] - Eb Gargano
Now, here's the really important thing. I want you to pick no more than nine things from this brain dump list. You might have hundreds of things here, but you're only allowed to pick a maximum of nine. So, you're going to have to be really ruthless. Basically, you have to think in terms of if I could only do nine of the things on this list this year, which nine would I pick?

[00:15:58.620] - Eb Gargano
So, when you've chosen next, you are going to retype or copy and paste those nine things into tab three. These nine things are your most impactful tasks, or MITs for short. These are the things you are going to spend the majority of your time on over the next year. When I say the majority of your time, I mean 80% to 90% of your time. Because these are the things that are going to really move the dial.

[00:16:29.710] - Eb Gargano
These are the things that are actually going to get you to where you want to be, not all that other stuff you've been doing with your time. Now, the next step is to plan when you will do these nine things. So, you need to take a look at your most impactful tasks and think logically, what order makes the most sense? Let's look at an example.

[00:16:49.390] - Eb Gargano
Let's say, your MITs are create a course, launch that course, create a lead magnet for that course, create an evergreen sales funnel for your course, and sort out your email marketing, because it's a total mess at the moment. Well, to me, it would make logical sense to first sort out your email marketing. Then do market research to understand what your readers and subscribers want to learn from you. Then create a lead magnet that tests and validates our idea and gets the right kind of people onto your list.

[00:17:23.500] - Eb Gargano
Those lovely warm leads. Then create your course. Then launch your course. And then create an evergreen sales funnel for your course. So, my reorder MITs might look like this. Okay.

[00:17:36.640] - Eb Gargano
Then you're going to sign a month or two for each of these tasks. So, you need to be really realistic about how long these things will take you. So, for example, it might be that it's going to take a month to sort out your email marketing, then a month to do the market research and create that lead magnet. Then it might take two months to create your course, and then maybe month five is your launch and month six is when you create that evergreen sales funnel. Obviously, this is just an example to help bring this yearly action plan spreadsheet to life.

[00:18:12.940] - Eb Gargano
You might have very different things here. And the other thing I should say here, and the reason I've said only nine MITs, is you should also plan in some breaks, some proper time off to rest and recharge. Because that's the other reason why you might be feeling stressed and overwhelmed and why you feel like you're working too much because you're not taking proper time off. Rest is so important. In fact, rest is one of the best productivity tools.

[00:18:44.250] - Eb Gargano
Okay? So now it's time to look at this month by month. So, let's take month one. Month one in our example is getting your email marketing in shape. Because you know that the better your email marketing, the more courses you'll sell when you launch that course.

[00:19:01.990] - Eb Gargano
So, here, you need to do two things. You need to break down this month's MIT into smaller subtasks and you need to decide when you will do those things. And here, you need to be super specific because unless you actually plan exactly when you will do each task, it's unlikely to get done. You know that old [inaudible 00:19:27]  age, don't you? A goal without a plan is just a wish.

[00:19:30.910] - Eb Gargano
Which is why you need to be super specific about what you will do and when you will do it. So, for month one, that might look like this. Notice how I've broken up my somewhat vague and loosely defined MIT of sort out email marketing into specific action steps. What do I mean by sort out email marketing and what specific subtasks do I need to do? I then put those subtasks in the order I think is most logical, and this is really important.

[00:20:05.660] - Eb Gargano
I have assigned a specific day and a specific week to each subtask. When you do this, you make your big MIT seem so much more manageable, but it also makes it much more likely you'll actually do each subtask, and so complete your MIT by the end of the month. I wonder if you have ever had a big vague task like sort out email marketing on your to do list for months or even years. Can you see how by getting super specific about what you need to do and when you're going to do it, you're going to be so much more likely to actually do that task rather than just keep putting it off and putting it off until some mythical one day in the future. Now don't worry, you don't need to plan all twelve months to this level of detail right now.

[00:20:58.720] - Eb Gargano
What I recommend you do for now is just write the MIT at the top of each of the future months with maybe just a few subtasks underneath. So, here's an example for month two. And here's the really cool thing. Every time, you have a good idea that relates to one of those future MITs, or if you read a really useful blog post, or if you see a really good ebook or course that would really help you, that relates to one of those future months, one of those future MITs, you're just going to quickly type that into the correct tab and then forget all about it.

[00:21:36.460] - Eb Gargano
Then at the end of each month, you can properly plan the next month just as we've done for month one. And you'll already have a whole bunch of useful stuff ready and waiting for you on that tab. Again, this is going to massively help with those feelings of stress and overwhelm because instead of trying to keep all those good ideas, all those blog posts and other useful stuff in your head, or on scrappy bits of paper, or in your inbox, you have a proper place to put them. And once you've put them there, you can forget all about those things until you come to plan that month. This will free up your headspace. And I cannot emphasize this enough, by freeing up more headspace, you will gain more bandwidth to focus on this month's tasks.

[00:22:25.240] - Eb Gargano
It's a simple productivity trick, but it's incredibly effective. Okay. So, I bet you're wondering about what to do about all the hundreds of things left on the brain dump tab. Okay. So, here is where you're going to need to be really ruthless because you're going to try and get rid of as many of those things as possible. Because remember, we've already planned in your most impactful tasks and those MITs are what you are going to be spending 80% to 90% of your time on. So, most of these activities on the brain dump tab you are going to have to get rid of completely because you don't have time to do them. Remember, your time is finite.

[00:23:14.670] - Eb Gargano
You cannot do everything, so you have to choose. By spending the majority of your time on your MITs, you know you are going to be doing the best possible things with your time. The stuff that's going to move the dial the most, the stuff that's going to give you the most bang for your buck. But it's always going to be a tradeoff.

[00:23:35.970] - Eb Gargano
If you choose to spend your time on one task, there won't be time to do other tasks. So that's why it's really important to choose to spend your time on the things that actually move the dial the most. And that's why you plan in your MITs first. If you don't, you'll fill up your time with all these other less impactful things and you'll never get to your most impactful tasks.

[00:24:03.040] - Eb Gargano
And if you spend all your time on tasks which don't move the dial much, you'll end up earning less and working more. Exactly the problem we set out to solve. Okay. So, with all these other things on tab two, you basically have five options, delete, minimize, delegate, automate, and delay. You need to work through every single task on this tab and decide whether you're just not going to do that activity. Or if you're going to minimize the activity, so it takes up very little of your time. Or if you're going to automate that activity in some way. Or if you're going to delegate that task, maybe to a VA. Or if you're going to delay that task, if you're going to put off that task for now and come back to it in the future when you've done your current MIT.

[00:25:00.790] - Eb Gargano
Now, I would love to go through this with you in more detail. I don't have time in this session. So, what I've done for you is I've created a free to do List Makeover Mini Course, which takes you step by step through this whole process and also includes the yearly action plan spreadsheet. You can access my free to do List makeover mini course by clicking the button or heading to productiveblogging.com/makeover. But there is one more tab on our spreadsheet that I want to talk about, and that's the next year tab. It may look simple and basic, but it's actually incredibly powerful.

[00:25:43.180] - Eb Gargano
First off, this is where you will move all of those tasks you've categorized as delay because some of the things on your brain dump tab are important tasks, which would really benefit your business, but they are not yet activities. You've picked your MIT for this year, but you know that these delay activities would make perfect MITs for next year. So, you can transfer them over onto the next year tab. But that's not all. You can also use this next year tab every time a new opportunity comes up and every time a new idea pops into your head, and every time you're tempted to ditch your plans entirely and chase after a new shiny object.

[00:26:31.950] - Eb Gargano
Instead of derailing your plans and chasing after those new shiny objects, you just write it on the next year tab and go back to what you were working on. You don't need to filter those ideas and opportunities in any way. You don't need to make any decisions about whether they're impactful tasks. In fact, I recommend spending as little time thinking about them as you can. Just add them to your next year tab and go straight back to what you are working on.

[00:26:59.010] - Eb Gargano
The reason why this works so well is because you're not saying it outright no to those good ideas and shiny objects. You're just saying, not yet. At the end of the year, you can then go into that next year tab and use it to help you with your planning for the following year. But crucially, you're not allowing those shiny objects to derail your carefully worked out plans for this year.

[00:27:25.010] - Eb Gargano
The next year tab also reduces stress and overwhelm and gives you a great place to store all of those good ideas safely. So, you can find them when you need them. I don't have much more detail about this in the free mini course, as well as what to do if a new opportunity presents itself midway through the year that's just too good to miss and can't be put off until next year. What to do about routine administrative tasks that just need to be done and what to do when stuff happens that isn't on your plan and needs immediate attention. Like, I don't know, if your website crashes or if your Google traffic takes a sudden nosedive, for example.

[00:28:07.090] - Eb Gargano
Remember, you can get my free to do list and makeover mini course, which takes you step by step through all we've covered in the session today in more depth, and that yearly action plan spreadsheet by hitting the button or heading to productiveblogging.com/makeover. After completing the to do list makeover mini course, you will have a clear idea of exactly what you want to achieve in 2023, a solid plan for how you will achieve your 2023 goals, and monthly action plans in place to ensure you actually follow through.
