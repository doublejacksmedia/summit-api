Kate Doster [00:00:00]:
Just like what I believe casually mentioned that people should buy.

Liz Stapleton [00:00:05]:
All right, I think we are live. I'm checking. Yes. It's pulling through. Hello, everybody. Who is joining us or watching the replay. We are super excited to be here. I'm with Kate Doster, and I don't know if Marlene is going to join us later. She may have just had thing come up. Totally understandable with summer and life, but we're super excited to be talking about Black Friday monetization especially. I love Kate's Approach to Black Friday. I've never been able to do it as well as her, but I certainly enjoy learning from her on it. So if you don't know Kate Doster, you should. She hosts a fantastic podcast. She's really good at email marketing and teaching you that I'm a listy, and I'm sure she'll explain what that means, but yeah. So, Kate, if you want to just tell them because I didn't want to say your podcast name because I know it changed names recently and I don't want to mess it's.

Kate Doster [00:01:04]:
Okay. Liz, I appreciate you. Anyways, so hey, everybody. I'm Kate Doster of kateDoster.com, host of the Do the Brave Thing online business podcast. And it is my soul and soul's mission to put money in the hands of good people so they can do good with it and prove for a fact that nice people do not have to finish last in business. And so we do this by tackling all of the illogical stuff, like your mindset, like, oh, my goodness, I'm annoying people, or someone's going to hate me or I'm an evil spammer face because I have the audacity to ask for money because I want to eat this week versus actual tactile things like use contractions in your emails. And here's how you write a great hook. So it is sort of my philosophy that we attack everything from all ends. And so really what it boils down to is I want to make sure that you're aware that you are not a bad person for asking for a sale. And I'm going to make sure that you have the words to actually say that to people. Yes.

Liz Stapleton [00:01:56]:
And one thing that I quote Kate on all the time she's famous for saying is "treat people like people". A once you kind of lock that into your mindset as well as her. See, I'm just going to be quoting you as well as her. It's a privilege to be on your list. It completely changes the approach you take to sales. But let's narrow this down to Black Friday. First of all, and I'd love to get when do you think Black Friday is going to start this year? Because I missed the memo last year that started a week early. It started like the previous Friday.

Kate Doster [00:02:32]:
Okay.

Liz Stapleton [00:02:34]:
Any predictions there and any suggestions?

Kate Doster [00:02:38]:
I honestly think that it's and it might just be because I follow a lot of ecommerce brands now because of my new hobbies. I'm into powerlifting now because that's what moms do when they turn 38, they become powerlifters. And a lot of athletic brand or athleisure brands start Black Friday like November 1. Like they honestly make it a month, which is kind of banana pants. So I don't by any means think that you need to dedicate all of November to Black Friday and you can run other promotions before Black Friday. You can have a better than Black Friday launch deal. But I do think that because all of the big retailers are starting Black Friday so early, I think that at least by that second week of November the latest, you should at least tell people what you are going to sell them on Black Friday. Just like let them know. And if you want to be like and we can talk about different bonuses and things you can do. And what if you don't want to sell on Black Friday? Don't worry, we got stuff for you to do there too. Just let people know what's coming. Again, the whole treat people like people. Because here's the thing. Black Friday just flips everyone's buyer switch and you might be like, but I talk about Facebook ads. Nobody cares about Facebook ads when they want to go and get the newest iPhone for cheap. No, they just want to spend money at this point, right. And they love gardening. And you also have to remember, especially if your clientele tends to be like females or moms or they're taking care of others, we don't tend to get presents unless we buy them ourselves. So you can be the thing that she buys herself to feel great. So that's why one of those things I just again, like to be really honest with people, it's like, okay, guys, here's like 90% of what's going on for Black Friday. I'm going to save one teaser thing for the week. But that's what I would do. If you want to start your sale early, say you don't want to actually wait for Black Friday because there are way more emails that go out on Black Friday. Go ahead and start it on the Monday. If it feels good to you. If feels good to you to start it on the Wednesday, go ahead and do it. It's your business.

Liz Stapleton [00:04:37]:
Yeah, no 100% agree. And actually I will say because people will buy things for themselves if you sell gift cards or something, that is a great way to kind of pitch it as well. And I don't know if I learned this last year, but if you have an Amazon list, you can put things that aren't on Amazon on your list to share with people. Just throwing that out there you know, might be a nice tip be if, you know, people aren't good at getting you gifts, give them your list and you can even put my gift card on it, right? So just throwing that nice little tip for you there okay. Once you've kind of decided.

Liz Stapleton [00:05:17]:
So I think you need to go.

Liz Stapleton [00:05:18]:
Into it with blinders on, almost a little bit of like, okay, I know I've got this window to decide when I'm running my sale and how long it's going to be, and then tell me if you agree with it and then stick to it rather than, as you find out what everyone else is doing. Constantly be making changes. I almost think you just got to have blinders on decide your path.

Kate Doster [00:05:39]:
I 1000% agree. Just decide what you are going to do. What I do recommend to my students because we do have a product about Black Friday is I do. Right? I was going to say let's might talk about it later on, but I recommend, in all honesty, at least doing a four day sale. I know some people want to just do Black Friday or just do Cyber Monday, but I still want to give people an opportunity to be able to see your offer. Right. And here's the thing that we didn't quite talk about because, yes, when does Black Friday start? Technically, you can open up your sale whenever, but Black Friday starts now. It starts in September because who are people going to want to spend their money on a Black Friday? Somebody that they have not heard from in a year and a half but then mysteriously pops up in their inboxes with this amazing offer for 50% off and you're just like, no spammer face or the person that has been showing up for them week after week in their inbox for the past two or three months. So now they are top of mind. So now it's like, oh, my goodness, what does Liz have? And so that's why one of the most important Black Friday strategies I can give you is consistently be emailing your list between now and Black Friday. It doesn't always have to be about the same topic. Say you're like me, you talk about a variety of things. It doesn't always have to be about gardening because you know on Black Friday you're going to do your gardening course, right? You can talk about the other stuff that you help people with, but you're constantly showing up and always answering that question. She's the coolest. She's my person. Again, every email is a sales email. You're selling the fact that you get your person, that you care about your person and that you're their type of person. Because all things considered, right, like say Liz and another competitor could do legal templates, right? And maybe they're having literally the same fact black Friday sale, right? But because Liz has shown up for them, we got three because she's hanging out with you guys here, you're going to buy Liz's templates even if they're a cool $3 more than the other gibronis, you're going to go with hers because she's your person. So that's technically when Black Friday starts, it's like now.

Liz Stapleton [00:07:36]:
Yeah, make it your goal that they recognize your name in their inbox. That might be an easier goal than like, oh, I have to email, be like, well, I need to email enough that they know my name. I think maybe when people saw the panels being like, tuesdays was Q four marketing and today's Black Friday and it's August, may have been like, that seems a little early, but really we want.

Liz Stapleton [00:08:00]:
To get you pumped up so you.

Liz Stapleton [00:08:02]:
Can dive in next month. And then I think if you take sorry, swallowed something weird, Kate's course on Black Friday, she's even like, okay, here's what you need to be doing in like it really does start earlier than you think. Even if it's not just planning the sale, it's the lead up to the sale, the warm up, which is something I always I'm terrible at actually doing. I do email people regularly, but then I'll just be like, by the way, I'm having a sale. I don't warm them directly up to the sale. But let's kind of talk about some different ways to maybe approach your Black Friday sale. Like, are you going to do a straight discount? You like to do bonuses and kind of different maybe get the ideas flowing of what might make a great Black Friday offer.

Kate Doster [00:08:49]:
Sure. So you can do a variety of things. And Liz and I had talked about this a little bit before we had hopped on, if you don't want to do a Black Friday deal, you don't have to. What I would recommend, because, again, people are in the buying season. And because you're still going to be showing up in their inboxes between now and hopefully the end of the year and beyond, then reach out to some of those products that you know your audience would love to see. Hey, are you doing anything for Black Friday? Now, they might not know in August unless they're a bigger company, but if we're like, hey, Kate, do you know what you're doing for Black Friday? I don't yet. That's a September Kate problem. But I'll let my affiliates know well ahead of time because they might want to sit it out and be like, you know what? I'm just going to do either a roundup post or I'm going to do the three best deals that I found. That sort of thing. I wouldn't do like a hundred million or all this other stuff, but I would make sure that it's sort of really specific. I know we had talked about Amazon reminder with Amazon you cannot send direct affiliate links and emails as of the time this recording, but check as of the time of this recording. You could send a link to your influencer store if you have one, so you could show people like, it's right in the influencer store. Just click here and go there. So again, chances are you're going to get higher commission rate suggesting other programs, other apps, other courses and things that you've used that your people could actually use. So just know that you can technically just go there. If you want to stand out from all those other affiliates, then you can listen to some of the other stuff we're doing. So for Black Friday, there's a myriad of things that you can do. You can indeed do a straight discount if it's just like, you know what, Kate, I got no time. I don't care. People just want like 25% off. Just go with it. I wouldn't do anything less than 25% off. I wouldn't do like 10% off because everyone's going to be like, no one necessarily cares. But you can do fun things too on Black Friday. So say you can be brave on Black Friday. So say that there has been a course or a topic or an offer, a program, a summit, a live something that has been on your heart, but maybe it's like just you haven't been brave enough to be able to launch it. Launch it for Black Friday because then technically you can sell at a super intro price, right? And now you'll be able to test to see is your audience receptive to hearing about this, right? You could do something really simple like maybe it's going to be an audio course. You can use something like Hello Audio which is a private podcasting stream. Now you don't have to worry about slides typos technically handouts. And it's like, okay, this is what I can do. And you could either offer it really cheap if you wanted to like say you're going to do like a $7 deal, right? And then it's like and guys, later on it's going to be like 47 or whatever, you can raise the price. So if you've got some more time, I will say if you have nothing to offer for Black Friday, don't try to create it for Black Friday. You're going to tell people that it's a presale so they're going to get it. I say usually give it to people in December because all of November and October, your whole focus should truly be on growing your audience and nurturing your audience even more so than normal. Not actually trying to put this thing together 1000%. You're going to have a sales page for it. You can have your outline, but just don't try to do that so you can sell something new. You can be a little bit brave. It can be lower priced if you want to, it can be higher price. You can have special Black Friday only bonuses. So maybe you are going to again, if it's not be created yet, it's like, hey, if anybody buys and I wouldn't do this for Black Friday, but it's like if anyone buys a Black Friday. SOS Kit, I am going to offer a special set of templates for you to be able to send anytime you want to do like a normal flash sale. We don't ever have this right? You could do something like the first 100 people to buy something or the first ten people to buy something. You can do physical products. So anyone who buys, say just on Black Friday you're going to get a mug. We use printed mint for our mug. Anyone who buys after the rest of the weekend can just get this other bonus. You can reach out to some of your friends and people that you've met here and be like, hey, do you want to do a bonus swap with me? And it's like, oh, okay, so I have a list builders masterclass that I offer as a little bonus for one of my email marketing courses. I mean, hey Liz, do you have a legal bonus? And we'll just swap. You can just give it to your people, kind of sweeten your pot. You can do it that way. You could do a price whatever you want sale. You could do a percentages going to charity. Just make sure after Black Friday gets there, you tell people it gets there and where it's going to go, you can have contest. Those are actually really fun. So it's like, hey, anybody that purchases anything on Black Friday is going to get five entries to win one, two or three. Anyone who buys on the Saturday gets four. Anybody who on the Sunday gets three. Don't forget to send those Sunday emails, by the way. Monday you're going to get two, right? So you can do some things where it's just like, okay, so now I don't have to give everybody all my courses for free. It's just like one person is going to get this or like one person is going to get a gift card. So you can do a lot of fun, unique things on Black Friday. Sort of like test it out. Maybe you have a self paced course and you're going to offer in December that you're going to do just these calls. So technically all you have to do is show up for an extra hour, but people are going to be really excited because you're going to be there for an extra hour. Normally they couldn't ask you any questions. There's a lot of things to wrap it up that you can do. You can do a discount, you can do a contest. You can do disappearing bonus. You can if you have Thrivecart, which Liz and I love, you can do a pay what you can. You can pre sell something brand new. Maybe you're going to do a pay what you want for this new thing that you're being brave enough to test out or you want to see like, hey, will people actually buy this? You can do all those sorts of things. You can bundle things. Discount can. If you have a lot of products, you can put them together or little parts of them to offer a special Black Friday bundle. There's a lot of things you can do besides just discount or you can just do a discount if it's just like, something is better than nothing, kate then just do a discount.

Liz Stapleton [00:14:34]:
Yeah, and I've seen businesses that don't actually do any discount, but they're like, if you buy between this time, half or 100% of your purchase is going to go towards charity, that is a way to do it, too. So, yeah, you'll probably be earning the same as if you did a discount, but it gives everyone that feel good feeling. And then another one I would just throw up out. There is a bump sale, which those are fun, those are fun. You can't do it with thrivecart. It's like a specific thing, I think I've only ever seen it with the one. It's like bumpsale.co it's bump sale.

Kate Doster [00:15:09]:
Yeah. Jason zook did it. And Caroline.

Liz Stapleton [00:15:12]:
Yeah, and I've used it before a couple of times. But what it does is you start the price however you want, super low for your product, and then each person that buys has to pay incrementally more, like one dollars more or $5 more or whatever. And so it incentivizes people to really get in early to get the lowest price they can. That could be a fun one as well, too. And I feel like kind of how fun or complicated is really going to depend on your tech know how and what tech stack you currently use.

Kate Doster [00:15:41]:
Right. And honestly, like, your own bandwidth, so I know I'm thinking of one marketer, she's brilliant, but they do I think she calls it like a fire sale. So it's like every day in those four days is like something different or they peel away, like a huge bonus. That would just be way too much customer service for myself. And my right hand lady is Abby for us to take care of. And honestly, turning people being like, oh, my God, no, I don't want to deal with that. But she likes to do it. So you could technically do a deal a day if you wanted to. That's entirely up to you and your bandwidth and what you want to do. Yeah.

Liz Stapleton [00:16:14]:
And you can always kind of test it out, right? Like, do it as a Labor Day, see how you feel doing one a day or something. Honestly, you guys can make up a sale for anything you want. It could be your birthday. I'm doing that next month. I'm doing my birthday bonanza. Like, different things. Honestly, if it's something that's personable to you, too, it'll stand out more to others as well. Just in my experience.

Kate Doster [00:16:44]:
And don't think that because you're telling people what you're offering for Black Friday that's going to cannibalize your sales in the interim. It's not, it's going to be fine. And say if you're not announcing it to your people, I'm not doing this for the record, but say, like, I was doing a discount on Collaboration Cash In or something, right? I could tell Abby in the back end like, okay, anyone who buys it in November before Black Friday, let's send them Kate Cash or something. You can do something if you want to for your previous customers, but also realize you don't have to. I'm not mad at Kohl's if I bought this shirt and then a month and a half later it's on mean, there are some people like the most of us are just like, eh, right, just like I know Apple's not going to give you a brand new iPhone when the new iPhone comes. So like your audience don't think that you have to bend over backwards. They'll be okay. Yes.

Liz Stapleton [00:17:38]:
And focus on kind of anything you can automate that would take it off your plate as well.

Kate Doster [00:17:43]:
Yeah.

Liz Stapleton [00:17:43]:
No, I love so you do. Kate cash. I do blogger breakthrough Bucks. I think we all took Lizzie Godder's training on.

Kate Doster [00:17:53]:
Your no. Oh no, I would never do like I've seen what she thought to do on the back end because I think I bought one of her summits or something or she was in one of my bundles, I don't know. Lizzie is very cool and it seemed like you had to keep personal track of everyone and it's not like it's like a code like the way she did. I'm just like, no, yeah, no, I.

Liz Stapleton [00:18:11]:
Don'T do it quite like she did, but it gave me the kind of idea wherewithal to do something similar. But yeah, so, I mean, there's so many different things you can do and even if you tell your audience we're talking about tell your audience for me that's like via email, I'm not necessarily social media because I'm terrible at social media. So it's not going to necessarily cannibalize your sales because not everyone's on your list and not everyone on your list sees all your emails, which is why you need to repeat yourself or what.

Kate Doster [00:18:41]:
I'll do because again, I'm more of a sometimes we'll do percent off, but why not? But I like really doing fun bonuses. Like if you already bought the course, I'm not going to not give you the bonus. So I tell them like, hey, you're not going to hear from me that much on Black Friday because we're offering this as a bonus, but lucky you get it anyway, so I'll see you in December and they're like want to be an affiliate for it. So it all works out.

Liz Stapleton [00:19:03]:
Yes, it does. Okay, so let's talk about emailing during kind of November in general because I know we're talking about, hey, befriend of mine starting now, and that may be just once a week, but come November, everyone's inboxes are flooded and once a week and especially during your sale, like once a day may not cut it. How would you suggest people get over the fear of emailing so much during the sale period or during November in general.

Kate Doster [00:19:33]:
Well, there's a couple of things. One, we have to remember that not everyone is going to see all of our emails because they are getting inundated with emails. So it's just kind of like a mindset shift. You have to think to yourself, again, we talk about being on your list as a privilege and treating people like people. It's like, well, they wouldn't hang out with me if they weren't into gardening because I have a gardening blog, so obviously they want to know about a gardening deal and I want to be a jerk. And in three days they'd be like, well, I didn't even know you were offering 50% off your gardening co course. Like, what? So your thought philosophy on this is like, well, I'm going to be a jerk if they don't hear about it. Another thing that you can do, and I highly recommend this anytime you're doing any type of promotion, I do it at the top of the email. A lot of people like to do it. At the bottom is give people a link to be able to opt out of your promotional emails, but be able to still stay on your email list. So we literally have like a big gray box. I'm just like, exercise your right to choose. Sometimes I say, dude, right? Like exercise your right to choose, dude. Do you already know that you don't want to flood your email list with all these new subscribers from Bundles? Click here. I'm not going to tell you about the bundle course anymore this promotional period, or I'm not going to tell you about Black Friday emails. We'll chat afterwards. So that way people always have that option of just being like, oh, so now you know that it's not just you push, push, pushing. They can choose to opt out of these emails. And then you have a little page and then you can be like, hey, I guess if you were slightly better at social media, be like, hey, if you do get curious about the sale, just follow me over on Social or listen to this podcast. Again, have a next step for them to do on that app dot out page. Just don't leave them be like, okay, got it. Talk to you in December. Give them a little something extra to be able to do there. And honestly, again, treat people like people. Let them know that if you're going to be sending a little bit more emails, you're not going to apologize to them, but just let them know. You can if you want to send resend emails, you can do that without emails at harvest providers where if somebody hasn't opened an email, you can just resend it to a certain section of people. So you might want to say send one maybe early on Black Friday. And again, let people know in PS messages that week before, say, if you're just opening on Black Friday, like, I'm sending my email at 09:00 A.m.. A lot of emails are going out at 09:00 A.m.. So if you don't see it, you can email me back because people will email you and be like, it's 905 and I haven't gotten it yet. It's going to be like that because you're going to have a relationship with your list, because you've been putting in the work now since then and you're going to be there after them, right? So just let them know it's okay. For actual Black Friday, again, depending on when your sale is starting or how long it's available, if you want to send first thing in the morning, if you want to send the afternoon, if you are doing one of those things where every day it's something different or just it's Black Friday only. Definitely if it's Black Friday only, you want to send at least two emails that day so that way people have a chance to see it and again, call it out. Two people, like people I think literally, I tell all my students, like literally the first line of all of our emails, like, look, I know that your inbox is on fire right now with all of these other emails. And I just want to say, one, I appreciate you actually taking the time to open this, hopefully not just to unsubscribe. Two, because we've got a lot of work to do. We need to make sure know kids stop throwing a tantrum or that you actually are getting your SEO off. So Google sends people to your site so I think that it can work out really. So, like, don't be afraid. Give them a way to opt out and send emails on that. Like if you do nothing. Some people want to take that Saturday off for Small Business Saturday, that's fine since Sunday has no catching name. Nobody sends any emails on Sunday. So I usually like to send like, say if I'm doing like a big offer that I can have a free preview of, I'll send like a freaking lesson or free PDF or like a frequently asked question. I make sure that Sunday email is a good one because people are still checking their emails on Sunday because, well, they're bored. Let's be real. They had to hang out with their family.

Liz Stapleton [00:23:18]:
My credit card is already smoking. May as well just keep going, right?

Kate Doster [00:23:22]:
Or they're getting primed again, what do I want to buy on Cyber Monday? So it's okay. Like I said, you're always going to have that link. You can just opt out. Search your email service provider plus the words link trigger or click trigger in case if it does come up. Or hopefully you have an email service provider where you have customer support, email them, do the customer support. Again, ConvertKit makes it wicked easy. And they're also very nice, but they have a lot of documentation on how to do that. So that way you can tag. People and you'll be good to go. So do not be afraid of helping people.

Liz Stapleton [00:23:56]:
I made a lot of notes on what you just said, so I want to add one of the easiest ways to probably set that up is to create a content snippet that you can use throughout the promo, so you're not having to remember to type it up in each email if you want. I would also say I tend to on the first email where I'm maybe mentioning that's coming up, do the opt out option at the bottom and then the rest of the emails where it's like in your face. I do the opt out at the top, so I kind of move it around a bit.

Kate Doster [00:24:22]:
You will get people that will click that link because they're excited and they'll be like, I don't hear about it. We get that. So just brace yourself because again, it's not something that you see very often and it's like, it's okay, we'll put you back on. It's very easy to remove that. Don't email.

Liz Stapleton [00:24:38]:
And so a couple of other things I wanted to note was everything Kate just said doesn't just apply to your own offers. You can email multiple times a day about an affiliate promotion that you know is going to end, just I know we kind of are talking about it in terms of our offers and our sales, but the same goes for whatever it is you're using to monetize Black Friday, whether it's your own products or someone else. And then the last thing I wanted to say, because I didn't want to interrupt you, you were on a really good roll, was when we're talking about being consistent now, if you haven't emailed your list in a while and you're going to start this week or next month, you don't necessarily need a day. You don't need to be like, sorry, I've been gone for a year. Right? Just dive back in. They'll think that they just missed it or something, and that's fine. You don't need to bring attention to the fact that you weren't consistent before. Just start being consistent now.

Kate Doster [00:25:34]:
Yeah. Because that really does nothing for anyone. Again, the answer is today. When are you emailing your list? If it's been forever today. The thing that we always suggest to the students, because people love to buy stuff, ironically, are just like three apps, three resources, three places, three things, three sites, and then at the bottom and the PS is like, wondering how I got your email address in the first place, and then talk about how you would have gotten their email address. It's been in the first place because the only thing that, oh, I'm so sorry, it's been forever that's doing is just making yourself feel better. It's not really adding any value to them. But it's like, if you're telling me the three best places to get discount yarn for my knitting, I'm all about that. Like, that would be fantastic. And then it's like, oh, yeah, I signed up for a free knitting course a while ago.

Liz Stapleton [00:26:18]:
Exactly.

Kate Doster [00:26:20]:
Yeah.

Liz Stapleton [00:26:20]:
It doesn't provide value. It's all about providing your audience. Value is a better way to put.

Kate Doster [00:26:24]:
It, as Kate said. And again, it's not like it's like I think people get so overwhelmed because they'll be, well, like, I don't know what I'm going to be talking about in a couple of weeks. It's okay. You don't always have to point to a bigger blog post, to a bigger summit that you're a part of, to a bundle that you're running. Just come up, literally grab a calendar and be like, okay, I've got like, how many weeks do we have left? Like three in August. Not even. Yeah. So if you send an email today, technically you have three emails to send in August. I think you can come up with three ideas for.

Liz Stapleton [00:26:58]:
Kate has, like, two years worth of ideas, and I literally.

Kate Doster [00:27:02]:
Put them on a week. And if you're like, I don't like this prompt this week, go to a different it's okay.

Liz Stapleton [00:27:08]:
Yes. And honestly, if you guys really just the brain power is not there. I don't know, maybe you have a newborn, you're not sleeping. Go to one of your older emails and just send it again. Like, copy and paste. There's going to be people on your list that have never seen it. There's going to be people that maybe got it but never read it. Or they read it and they forgot about it. It's okay.

Kate Doster [00:27:29]:
Yeah. And the people you think, they complain, like, oh, you've already said that. The only emails that you ever get back from those are like, oh, I remember when you said this a little while ago, but you know, I never did it again. Treat people like people. They procrastinate. They need to hear stuff more than once.

Liz Stapleton [00:27:42]:
Yes. So you're going to feel like you're talking about an ad nauseam, but they're not going to feel like they're necessarily hearing about it nonstop. Okay, let's talk about besides not emailing your list, what are some mistakes you see people making when it comes to Black Friday and trying to all of a sudden make a big profit?

Kate Doster [00:28:05]:
I think we talked about not emailing our list. That one is like, absolutely number one. Number two, I feel, would be not and we talked about this already is not actually telling your community what it is ahead of time so that way they can plan. Number three is getting in your own head and not doing anyone at all. Or number four is say that you're so desperate for cash is that you're undermining your whole business. Right. I would never say to someone like, oh, offer like, 80% off your entire store. Right. You need to make an offer to put together a bonus package to do whatever you want to do, and you need to be able to say it with your whole heart. If you can't say it out loud without a pit in your stomach, then don't say it, right? And this kind of goes for any time that you're pitching anything. I also think with Black Friday, not giving them an option to opt out and I also think not emailing them, especially on Black Friday and whatever day that you're ending, not sending at least two emails is a really big mistake because again, they're dealing with a bigger onslaught of emails. So you want to make sure that they have this because they're not going to get another opportunity to do this. Maybe you'll have the same Black Friday offer next year, but maybe you won't. That's the whole point of this is to do something you don't normally do. Say if you're doing something like that, buddy, bonus, right? I can't always get my friend Nicole and Liz and my friend Krista to give me stuff for free. To be able to give you guys to help. Again, you want to make sure those are relevant bonuses, not their whole courses. Like relevant. Like I can't get them to do this all the time. So you need to kind of go at it with like this person is going to get a fantastic deal. They're going to be so happy. I'm going to be so happy. Like, let's do this.

Liz Stapleton [00:29:47]:
Yes. I wouldn't consider myself a super woo woo person, but being an entrepreneur, there's ups and there's downs. And if you're trying to write pitch type emails in one of your lows and it's coming from a place, from desperation, the energy is just not going to come across in a way that people are going to want to buy.

Kate Doster [00:30:05]:
They can smell it for a mile away.

Liz Stapleton [00:30:07]:
Yeah. So just kind of keep that in mind when you have a win.

Liz Stapleton [00:30:11]:
Be like, hey, I'm going to go.

Liz Stapleton [00:30:12]:
Write a sales email because I know How awesome am I right now.

Kate Doster [00:30:13]:
right? I always tell people to put on their ultimate guilty pleasure song. Like that song that if you're at a red light and there's no other cars around, that you would just rock it out so unbelievably hard to you're going to listen to that song and then you're going to sit down and then you're going to write that email, right? Even if it's that last chance email, if it's that intro email where you're initiating your pitch and you're not thinking about all the money you're going to make, you're going to think about all of the stress and hassle that you are relieving from your person. And this goes with everything. With all the changes in my business, I am so much more excited for the that my students are going to be able to accomplish then the fact that I have this offer and that shines through so much. So when you are so stoked for the fact that your person is going to be able to grow the perfect tomatoes and that they could actually go and win a gardening contest or when they go to the barbecue, everyone's going to be like, oh, my God, Tracy, where did you get these tomatoes? Your tomato cucumber salad is amazing. Is that a TikTok recipe? No, it's because I made those cucumbers and tomatoes. Right, so you're giving the person that bragging, right? So now all of a sudden, you're like, yeah, this is the best. And then you're going to go and you're going to type, type, and she's going to get it for 30% off and she's going to get an extra bonus. Right. So all of a sudden, it's not about your Black Friday offer. It's the things they're going to be able to accomplish with what you're giving them. And they get this thing for free or they get to be entered in a contest or you know what I mean? Like you don't necessarily need lead with it. One other mistake that I will say that people tend to make on Black Friday is they bury the lead. Whatever your cool thing is for Black Friday, just make it your subject line. And I know that I just told you, make it like an and she gets this in the email. It's an and it's 50% off at the end. Right, because they're not like, leading with that, per se. The subject line is literally like 50% off all courses. Right. Win a year's worth of lead pages. Whatever your special thing is for Black Friday, especially in the open cart email, just say it in a subject line. Okay.

Liz Stapleton [00:32:13]:
I like that. Yeah.

Kate Doster [00:32:15]:
No, people skim for deals, right? So in case if your name hasn't been synonymous with must open and we're going for like those, I call them secondary subscribers, no offense to them, but the secondary subscribers, they're going to say like, OOH. And they're going to open it based on the deal.

Liz Stapleton [00:32:28]:
Yeah, absolutely. Yes. You have a business to make money, but your goal is to solve problems. Right. And so if you're coming from that angle so my favorite feedback that I'm always striving for is I want them to use myself and be like, oh, my God, you just made my life so much easier. That is my favorite piece of feedback.

Liz Stapleton [00:32:47]:
That I always want to get.

Liz Stapleton [00:32:49]:
So that's always my goal, and hopefully people are getting that from the summit.

Liz Stapleton [00:32:54]:
We'll see. Okay.

Liz Stapleton [00:32:57]:
I feel like we've covered a lot. We're both fast talkers, but I'm trying to think kind of I know you're an email marketer, and besides email marketing, which I think is the best way to kind of get in front of people, do you have any other sort of tips on marketing and maybe growing your audience before black Friday or to really ramp and get ready for it?

Kate Doster [00:33:21]:
Yeah, because like I said and this is why I said if you are going to do that something new. You're just going to outline it and make a sales page for it. You're not going to actually create it because really all of your time right now, like I said, has to be growing your audience and nurturing the audience that you have. So there's a myriad of things that you can do between now and Black Friday. You can do things like freebie swaps. So that's where you get together with one of your pals who helps kind of the same audience but in a different way, right? And you literally just write an email about each other's freebies, right? So it's like, hey Liz, would you tell your list about my tiers list of email ideas? And I'll tell them about this course that you have, right? And you do that, right, if you feel like that's too big of an ask, right? Because I know some people get really nervous when you pitch to your person. Be like, it just doesn't have to be about my freebie because I know your email list is really sacred. You could do like three fun finds for Friday, right? And two other things could be an affiliate link and mine can be like, you're something free that you have, right. So you can give people some options. That works really well. We had one student do that and she ended up in less than a week with 752 new subscribers. In 48 hours, it was over 500, like her and her friend. Because again, it was just somebody that she met in a group like this, right, where they just had complimentary audiences, they talked about each other's normal freebie. Send them to the normal landing page and it works like gangbusters, right? You just have to have the nerve to ask. I think that's really important. If you wanted to do something like Facebook ads, know, in quarter four they are more expensive, especially around Black Friday, there's going to be a lot of dollar. There's just higher. So if you wanted to run them, if you already know how to do them and you have a back end to support them, meaning like you've got actual funnels in the background and all this sort of stuff. Not just doing them necessarily as a loss leader, if you will, you could do ads sort of now until mid September, October. You could do things like a bigger bundle if you wanted to be able to run one. You could probably get all of that stuff done and over with, say, run it in October, almost like a trick or treat thing. It can be like a mid or an early Halloween one that you can have. We've got a lot of back to school ones going on, right, which I think are fantastic. So you can do that if you wanted to go on the sort of interview route. Realize that a lot of podcasters we batch record and sometimes we just have them in our back pocket. So we can't really give you a date with that. So that might have to be like a longer term sort of growth strategy.

Liz Stapleton [00:35:44]:
Again, reaching out, that's a great yeah.

Kate Doster [00:35:46]:
So that's one of those habitual things like you're always necessarily going to do. Again, is it going to impact your Black Friday sales? It may or may not, depending on when that episode comes out. So those are something that you can do. But again, that's something that I feel like we should always constantly trying to be doing to get in front of other people's audiences. Same thing with guest posting because maybe like, oh, I hate interviews. That sort of a thing. I think that can work if you are already very heavy on Pinterest. I believe now is when you're supposed to start posting your holiday stuff. Again, I would never post a Pin about my Black Friday offers, but I'm pretty sure Pinterest now if I'm reading it right, I have not been on there in forever. One of my friends owns a Pinterest agency and I'm pretty sure she put it on her Instagram. Again, if you're going to do a social media short form video, it's just the thing that's getting pushed everywhere. But I wouldn't necessarily bank on it if that makes sense. Because you can do a reel every single day and you can have one that pops off for your account. Like say it gets, oh, it gets 10,000 views, but then the next 18 that you make get like 2000 and you're like, but I have 4000 followers. You're not even showing it to my followers. And that's why we like focusing on getting email subscribers so much. So try to again, see what you can do to collaborate. If you do have affiliate programs, can you do something with your affiliates where they share about your freebie or have affiliate launches or they interview them, or you offer to do a special ask me anything about this for their audiences? Like those sorts of things.

Liz Stapleton [00:37:18]:
Yeah. And if anyone's really doubting the power of email marketing, I would not be a full time business without my list because I don't really do social media. Not that I don't want to. It's always like, oh, I want to learn how to do that. But it just hasn't happened because I've got so many other things going on. My Instagram has like 300 followers, but I make a full time living running an online business because I have email lists. Because if I don't publish a blog post, if I do nothing else in a week to connect with my audience, I email them. That's always going to happen.

Kate Doster [00:38:00]:
1000%. We have over, well over a million dollars in course sales. And I have a cool 4000 people that follow me on Instagram. It's because I spent all of my time and effort growing my email list. Because one, I like that private container and two, statistically, like math, right, logic and woo woo, they're the most likely to buy. Because think about it, you're following probably at least 500 people on Instagram or TikTok, right? At least you are not subscribed to 500 people's newsletter list, right? You just aren't. So if you're on somebody's newsletter list, they're really important and they're on your radar or at least the topic that they teach is high up on your radar. Yeah.

Liz Stapleton [00:38:37]:
So just really focus on your list, if nothing else.

Kate Doster [00:38:42]:
One other thing. If you are worried on Black Friday about deliverability or spam complaints, if you're on ConvertKit, at least they make this really easy. You could technically choose, and this is up to you to only send your Black Friday emails to your active subscribers. So you cannot send them to the Cold subscribers. You could technically exclude them and that will get you higher open rates and a better sender score. And maybe that's something that you can consider doing all of November. Again, that's a gut decision you need to make. And again, some people, it depends if they only have like a couple of hundred Cold subscribers, but they've got a couple of thousand, like, oh, that's fine, we'll just those people, they never click on my stuff anyways. So these are like little things that you can do to build up your sender reputation.

Liz Stapleton [00:39:27]:
You could even work on cleaning up your Cold subscribers beforehand and being like, hey, I'm gearing up for the end of the year and if you don't want to get my emails, that's totally fine, but I don't want you. Here's the things you might be missing out on. So if you want to stay, click here because I do probably at least twice a year, two to three times a year will clean up and have a bunch be unsubscribed just automatically on my end or deleted or whatever.

Kate Doster [00:39:54]:
Yeah. And I think that a lot of email service providers are aware that during Black Friday there are going to be like, higher unsubscribes, higher spams. And again, I'm not saying that by emailing us between now and Black Friday, you won't get any unsubscribes. Of course you're going to get unsubscribes, right? But the likelihood, especially of getting that spam complaint is going to go way down. There are just some people that if anyone sends Black Friday email unsubscribe, well, that's too bad for you because now you're not going to get this great deal and I can't help you. And looks like you will not be winning any cooking contest.

Liz Stapleton [00:40:23]:
Sorry, Bob. Yeah, exactly. And as always, don't stress over the unsubscribes.

Kate Doster [00:40:31]:
There are plenty more fish in the sea. You'll be fine.

Liz Stapleton [00:40:35]:
Okay, I'm not seeing any more questions coming through. I don't know if there's anything else you want to kind of touch on. Any final words? I know we're kind of making this a little shorter, but because there's only two of us, we got to say all the things.

Kate Doster [00:40:53]:
Don't let Black Friday keep you from doing things in October. If you want to have a big launch in October, you go right on ahead and you have big launch in October. 2 years ago, we had our big launch of our signature course the week of my birthday, which is the first week of November. And we got a gajillion sales. People were fully aware I was not offering it for Black Friday, or if I was offering a Black Friday version of it, I let people know. It's like, oh, you can get this one with coaching. Oh yeah, in a couple of weeks. If you don't want it, it's here again, treat people like people. One of my core values is just honesty and integrity. Go figure, right? Which is fine. This is another thing we didn't touch on. Put timers in your emails, especially towards the end, and you can say this verbatim to your list because it's the truth. Time zones are a thing. And you can say 07:00 p.m. Eastern Standard Time and you will always get an email saying, oh, I thought I had more time. And so I'll literally be like, yeah, there's an email at the bottom of this. But that's because time zones are a thing. And so I want you to know that you got like 2 hours to decide. I don't want there to be any gray issues because I'm in daylight Savings time and you're not. I don't want you having to go over to clock Buddy and figure out what it is. So when you go in there again, it's all about how you approach it. It's like, it's that because then I'm going to stay in integrity. No, the timer was zero. You cannot get the deal. I would expect you to be honest with your people. I know that things come up, but we talked about it for the last two weeks, bro, that's on you. We're definitely, probably not going to do it next year, but you never know, it could come back around.

Liz Stapleton [00:42:31]:
Sure, yeah, no, I always like to use, and I shouldn't say a lot, I know ConvertKit has a countdown timer.

Kate Doster [00:42:40]:
That you it's in there, it's free.

Liz Stapleton [00:42:43]:
With your part of mean or there's like motion mail or something.

Kate Doster [00:42:47]:
There's all sorts.

Liz Stapleton [00:42:48]:
You don't have to pay to be able to put a timer for a fixed date sale. If you're doing Evergreen, that's a different panel session, other things. But what we're talking about now, where it's like again, you can say this for affiliate promos too, guys, the affiliate promo is going to run out at this time. And I already did the math to make sure I set up the timer right for right. Like so that you're not trying to figure out because I'm in Pacific, but the person running it is Eastern and my email is in Pacific. I've figured this out. I've made sure the timer matches.

Kate Doster [00:43:25]:
Again.

Liz Stapleton [00:43:27]:
Aren'T just for anything that you own and promote. It's for things you promote, period.

Kate Doster [00:43:33]:
And like we had talked about, hopefully whoever you're promoting will have the ability to let you know who was one of your leads, like, who bought from you. And you can do any of the bonuses besides probably a buddy bonus. You can do any of the other bonus strategies that we talked about here. You can run a contest. Hey. If any of you get Thrive Cart during their Black Friday sale, you'll be entered to win a 90 minutes call session with me. My course, this, you can offer those things. You can give everyone a small product so you can do things to sweeten the pot even though it's not like a big thing, right? You can give everyone like, say, a $47 course that you don't feel good about discounting, but if you're going to be making $300 off of Thrive Cart, you're fine with that $50. Because to you, you're really making $250. And you don't have to do anything right, per se besides send that email. So that's also something that you can always do as well. Yes.

Liz Stapleton [00:44:29]:
All right. I think that is fantastic, everyone. Like I said, go check out Kate. Katedoster.com, she's got all sorts of goodies, like I mentioned, the two years of email ideas and all sorts of other things as well. And the do the Brave thing podcast, she's just awesome. She just is. And she'll make you feel better about running your business.

Kate Doster [00:44:49]:
That is my ultimate goal. Like I said, we got to eradicate this idea that nice people have to finish last in business. People want to hear from you. And if you take nothing else from this, even if you do nothing for Black Friday, when you email your list, I want you to think instead of like, am I annoying people? I want you to think that there's one other person on the other end and they are just as excited about your topic as you like. You know how you just wish you had one friend that was also into Parks and Rec and all you want to do is quote it forever and just have somebody get it? When you wear your Cones of Dunshire shirt to the gym, but nobody says anything right here, right? I just want somebody to make the damn reference. No, they never do. So I want you to think to yourself, oh, my goodness, I am, and name your person. Talisha loves email marketing just as much as I do. She has a sales technique and she's going to be so excited to hear about this. And that is going to come through in your email and that's when you're going to replies back, I love your emails again, because you're not like, oh, my goodness, I'm going to annoy them. It's just like this person is also a giant nerd face when it comes to analytics. And they want to know about what's going on with Google Analytics, say yes.

Liz Stapleton [00:45:51]:
There's been a lot of Google Analytics this year. It's probably a really on point topic right there. All right. Yes. So, guys, feel free to comment below the video. It's going to be available replay for 24 hours, and if you have questions, let us know. Thank you again, Kate. Super appreciate you taking the if.
