Hey, guys, I'm really excited for this next session because I know very little about the topic. Our next speaker is a color psychology invisibility expert who helps entrepreneurs like us who have just so much to do, find clarity in our brand messaging and target our audience with color psychology. So, we can start attracting daily sales to our brand. So, Michelle Lewis is our speaker. Michelle, welcome. And thank you so much for being here.

[00:00:41.000] - Michelle
Hey, thanks for having me. I think this is going to be really fun.

[00:00:44.220] - Liz, Host
Yes, yes. So, I think the most pertinent question to start with is, what is color psychology?

[00:00:51.390] - Michelle
Yeah. So, color psychology is kind of the next step beyond branding. And we're taught branding, which is standing out in your marketplace, you know having that visual, usually your logo, your site, etcetera, to differentiate yourself. But the problem with that is that there's no intention behind the visuals that we choose. So, this is where color psychology. I mean we usually say it's a color, we, like it's our favorite color, but that's usually the end of it. Color psychology bridges the gap where now you're getting more into human behavior and how people respond to different colors.

[00:01:28.610] - Michelle
So that's what color psychology is. It's how color can subconsciously affect people's decisions, moods, and behaviors. So that makes it a little bit different.

[00:01:39.530] - Liz, Host
Can you give an example?

[00:01:41.490] - Michelle
Sure. I can give an example. Like there was a scientist I think, I want to say 1952. He was a Russian scientist. His name was SB Krakhov, and he did an experiment and put red and blue in front of his subjects and tested their physical responses to each color. And red increased the heart rate, dilated the pupils, increased the blood pressure. Blue did the opposite. So, every person has both a physical and a psychological response to color. There was an interesting study that a university did where they actually went into a prison and they painted the admitting cell pink.

[00:02:27.930] - Michelle
They wanted to see if it had an effect on prisoner's behavior, and it suppressed their emotions to the point where they could not yell and scream and all that and calm them down. And the effects lasted once they went into the prison for up to 30 minutes. So, that's the kind of thing that I'm talking about is how color has a very huge response when it comes to us looking at it, wherever it may be in person or like, we work on screen.

[00:02:53.910] - Liz, Host
Okay. So, I'm thinking of all the different places of, like, maybe you don't want the Buy button to be red or you know things like that. So that might even be a little different from your brand colors or whatever. What are the ways you see people missing out and using this, I guess, is my next question.

[00:03:19.830] - Michelle
Absolutely. Especially if you're a blogger, your website is everything. People coming to each blog is everything. And I think we've been taught that the words are the most important thing. And I'm not discounting that. We're all brilliant, and we all blog beautifully. But the visuals are just as if not even more important, because job number one, as the blogger, is to get people to click to your site. Job number two is to get them to stay on your site. And so as we know, people's capability for keeping their attention gets lower and lower every year.

[00:03:54.460] - Michelle
So, if you're not going to have videos and flashy things going off, what you can do is have a really good plan in place for the visuals on your website, the colors that you're using, that type of branding to get them to keep reading through. You can do little things. Like if your primary color is orange, maybe you have orange banners throughout your site, but you also in every paragraph, the key sentence that you want to have stand out. Maybe you highlight the whole thing. You bold, it you italicize it, and then you make it orange to get it to stand out off the page, those kinds of things.

[00:04:27.530] - Michelle
And like what you said, the buttons, those are huge, very crucial, making sure that they are set to convert as well. So I noticed a big difference when I started blogging and I started adjusting my branding so that would be really key. It helps so much. And I specifically promote my blog through Pinterest. And so images are huge. Color is huge.

[00:04:50.590] - Liz, Host
Yeah, our brains just process images and graphics way faster than we do words.

[00:04:57.520] - Michelle
Right.

[00:04:58.870] - Liz, Host
So, you don't want to be willingly about whatever graphics or images you're creating on your site. So, what is the mistake people make with color psychology? Are they, like only picking a color because of the psychology behind it or what mistakes are you seeing and how can they rectify that?

[00:05:20.170] - Michelle
Well, I think the first mistake is not knowing why you've chosen your primary brand color. If you and I were meeting for coffee and I said, why did you choose green? It usually would be. I like the color. I think that it means nature or health, and that's pretty much it. But yet I could say, okay, what's the messaging of your blog and you would be able to rattle it off to me like this. So, we have our overall messaging in place, but we don't have any attention, really, or any clarity on why we choose our colors. But each are equally as important when it comes to messaging.

[00:05:57.010] - Michelle
So what we want to do is be able to support the message behind our website, behind our business with color. So, I think when you can finally go, okay, ready to dig into the colors and not just choose them based on our needs. But our ideal clients primary emotion of why they're visiting our site, our viewer, or whatever you want to call it our reader. That's when things really start to change. So if you can choose your color based on that perspective, then you're going to have so much more attention when it comes to your branding.

[00:06:27.170] - Michelle
And the other thing that I've noticed that a lot of bloggers struggle with is that there's no cohesive visual presence. You're not really clear that that is their brand going from their website to their social media to their checkout page, whatever. It's just kind of not giving that much attention. But our job, especially because we know that now to have enough touch points to buy, you're looking at ten to twelve touch points of someone encountering your brand. Well, what if we could speed that up, which I've seen happen over and over again with color.

[00:06:58.470] - Michelle
So what if someone's going to your social media handle on Instagram. And let's say your primary color is green, and then they're going to your website, which is green, and they're going to your checkout page, which is green. It's going to make that subconscious support so much faster. Yeah.

[00:07:13.100] - Liz, Host
I think I'm definitely a little guilty of not doing that well enough.

[00:07:17.350] - Michelle
This is not something that's taught. That's why I'm so passionate about it. Everyone out there says branding doesn't really matter. People buy because of you, not your brand. Or don't worry about branding until you've made your first million. I've heard this all the time, and yet when you look at the stats, 85% of people buy based on visual appearance, it's huge. And that's why the big companies, McDonald's, Facebook, T Mobile, they put so much time and energy into this. Look at any drug commercial that you see on Hulu, you're going to notice one huge color, whether it's green or yellow or purple.

[00:07:51.320] - Michelle
Like, there's a reason that this is their job to figure this out because I mean in their case, they're manipulating their customer. In our case, we're trying to do it like for the good. But I think it's so important to know this to equip yourself and know that whenever you post on social media, it's going to go that much further because of the colors you've chosen to get people to your site to read your content.

[00:08:12.790] - Liz, Host
Okay. So, you're trying to pick colors based on where your people are kind of emotionally when they're in touch with your brand. What colors meanwhile? Like how do you go about deciding what's going to be best for you?

[00:08:29.350] - Michelle
Absolutely. So, this is something called color harmony. And what's really important on your site, and if you want, I have some slides I can pull up if it'd be easier to see a visual, so I can do that. But what's really important is for you to figure out a couple of key questions. So, let me bring those up really quick so that you can see exactly what I'm talking about. I just actually finished building this presentation, so the timing is perfect.

[00:09:00.970] - Liz, Host
Yeah.

[00:09:01.530] - Michelle
So, color harmony is specifically what colors go together in appealing way, not just to you but your audience.

[00:09:07.550] - Michelle
Remember, there's multiple factors to consider when choosing your color. It's not just what you like or what your ideal client likes. It all has to work together. So, if we look at the standard color wheel, I know that pink isn't on here, but pink is not in the standard color wheel. It's actually a color our mind invents when transitioning from purple to red, each color has its own unique meaning. So, these are the key questions to figure out to see which color is going to be best for your brand.

[00:09:36.360] - Michelle
And that's number one, how does the body interpret that color? Number two, how do audiences interpret the color on screen? Number three, are there any cultural restrictions on the color? And I'll explain that in just a minute. And then is it in harmony with our brand's intention? So, really important here. And like for me, my background is film and television, interior design and natural healing. So, I've studied color in all of its many forms, and I think we not only need to know what happens in the body, we need to know it from a scientific perspective.

[00:10:08.470] - Michelle
We need to understand how people perceive it on screen. We need to know all of these different things to make an educated choice on color. So, let's talk about red for a second and let's answer these questions when it comes to red, because obviously each one is really in depth. So, I can't go through every color today, but I will break down red. Like we talked about the body interprets the color in terms of raising the heart rate, dilating the pupils, raising the blood pressure. Audiences interpret that color on screen so that's whether they're looking at the computer monitor or TV screen, people feel very intense with red.

[00:10:45.180] - Michelle
It's called the caffeinated color on screen. So, it brings a lot of, like, speed up feelings, either with an action scene or a passion scene. So, you know that that's what it evokes when people see that color on your site. For the cultural restrictions on the color, it's important to know where most of your audience is tuning in from, and that's so that you can choose the right color. So, for example, as we can see here, if you're wanting it to represent excitement. But most of your audiences in South Africa, that's not going to work because it's the color of mourning.

[00:11:16.810] - Michelle
So, it's important to know culturally how each culture perceives color. So that based on where your audience is, you can make the right decision. And then is it in harmony with our brand's overall intention? So if your intention is to wake up, excite and take action, then the answer would be yes. So, I want you to look at, these colors, these photos here. You can see red. Notice your physical response. Some people are going to love this. Some people are going to hate it that are watching, and that's totally fine.

[00:11:45.770] - Michelle
Every one of us has a color bias. But the beautiful thing is, if you're armed to know exactly what it means, you're going to have so much more clarity with your brand, which means your visuals, which means your marketing strategy. And since our goal is to reduce the touch points, one of the best ways we can do that is visually. Does that make sense?

[00:12:07.820] - Liz, Host
Yeah, yeah I know. It does. I didn't know some of the cultural stuff, so that's always new.

[00:12:14.860] - Michelle
That's fascinating.

[00:12:15.870] - Liz, Host
I mean, some of it I did, but yeah, no, it is. It's really interesting. So that is a lot of information for one color. And then you obviously get into different tones and different like, you know depths or whatnot? Because you might not choose red. You might choose dark red. How are you figuring that out? Is there a resource you recommend people look at to try to make sure their colors are aligned?

[00:12:52.210] - Michelle
Sure. Well, I mean, of course, I'm going to say if you want all this information in one thing, take my color course. But what? I had a big problem with it because I taught this for a while before I separated it out into his own program. And this is the problem I ran into. People would choose the color, but they'd have a really hard time making sure it was the right shade. And if they chose it primarily for their ideal client, after a few months, there would be a disconnect because they didn't feel like they were enough in their brand, if that makes sense.

[00:13:22.710] - Michelle
So, I went back to the drawing board and tried to figure out, okay, what is the answer to this? And then I stumbled upon tonal color harmony. And I realized that where the ideal client is most likely going to determine the primary brand color, the shade, the tone is really determined by the personality. And so, I tested this with a couple entrepreneur friends of mine that came to me and said, like, okay, my colors are orange and green. I hired a branding designer. It worked really well for a couple of months, but I'm feeling a disconnect and I look at it and go, okay, your current colors are in the summer palette.

[00:14:03.370] - Michelle
Why don't we move them into the spring or autumn palette? Adjust and see how you feel. And that was it. So, it's really interesting, like, in a way, how much work on the back end it takes to get this locked in. But the beauty is once it's locked in, then it's so easy. And it's something that you're going to stick with for at least a year or two because you've researched it in the right way, if that makes sense.

[00:14:26.570] - Liz, Host
Okay. So yeah. I think that's an important point is that you can change later on. Say, someone didn't know about color psychology and pick their colors out and everything. What would you suggest they do? You know because I'm sure everything is already set up, and it's rebranding design wise. There's a lot more to it than most people even realize.

[00:14:58.650] - Michelle
And I hear this a lot. I mean, I've had people that come and they want to learn in the course and they're like, I heard this out. I'm not willing to do this again. So I'm not going to do this. And I said, that's absolutely fine. I'll see you in a couple of months, right? Because usually they keep going, they keep having the same frustration and they come back. So it's important to look at if you're feeling a little stuck. And like, I really don't think that I should be investing this much time.

[00:15:21.180] - Michelle
I should be working more on acquiring leads or whatever it is, subscribers, look at right now what's working and what's not are you happy with your monthly views? Are you happy with your social media following numbers? Are you happy with the number of subscribers you're getting or has it plateaued or decreased? How are your sales? How are your upsells? Is all of that working? Because if you've put a lot of effort into it, you know that your offers are good, but there's still something that's just not in flow or just feels like it's catching.

[00:15:54.910] - Michelle
It could be as simple as your branding and your color scheme. So, usually when people analyze that and go, oh, well, yeah. I am noticing this. I am noticing that I'm not getting on camera as much anymore. I am noticing I'm not sending out emails as much anymore. I feel tired in my business. That's usually a huge indicator that it is time for a refresh. And if you put in this work in the back end with the color, the great news is you're not having to touch your website, right?

[00:16:21.730] - Michelle
Your funnels, your social media graphics, like all of that becomes much easier when you have this in place. Does that help answer that? 

[00:16:30.680] - Liz, Host
Yeah. So, one question I would have is do you ever recommend sort of a B testing different colors if you're just not sure?

[00:16:41.250] - Michelle
I do recommend going through specific questions, interviewing your ideal clients, making sure that you've really narrowed into what their primary emotional drivers are, and this way that you support them with your offerings, whether it's affiliate or your own products. So, usually if you've done the target market research, then it becomes very clear. You absolutely then can AB test as long as you have a large sample of an audience that has converted or is your ideal client. But nine times out of ten, I found that once you go through those target market research questions, it becomes very very apparent what color is going to be the best driver for you.

[00:17:21.700] - Liz, Host
Okay. And typically you're going to have more than one color, or at least most people will. How many colors? Yeah. Like you have a main color and accent color. How many colors is too many colors?

[00:17:35.140] - Michelle
I recommend one primary color, two secondary colors, and then pretty much what the background of your website and your text color is going to be, which is usually a version of white, gray or black.

[00:17:48.150] - Liz, Host
Okay. And I just want to be a little bit clear when you say primary color, you mean main color. Not necessarily blue, yellow or red.

[00:17:57.210] - Michelle
Yes.

[00:17:57.570] - Liz, Host
For anyone that super like knows their color.

[00:17:59.510] - Michelle
And has been to art school, they might have a little sticking point with that.

[00:18:04.320] - Liz, Host
Yes. Yes. So, yeah. So, main color into secondary. Okay. And if someone has, like, five colors, yes, we've determined that. How would you suggest they kind of trim it down?

[00:18:20.970] - Michelle
Well, if you choose from one of the seven primary colors, you have to remember that you are hitting someone physically whenever they see it. So, then if you have two colors, you're hitting someone twice, three, three times, etc. Etc. So, if you have five or six colors, imagine the physical onslaught that you're causing the person. They're going to have a disconnect. They're going to click off your site, they're going to hop off. They're not going to buy as much from what I've seen. So it's really important to narrow it down.

[00:18:50.700] - Michelle
And I'm not saying you're not going to have variations of your colors on your website, your pages, your social media, but make sure that you have that one primary color and then one to two at the max of your secondaries. That way, you're going to have a lot more balance to your site, and people aren't going to know why. But they're going to be attracted to you. They're going to trust you. And they're going to say, I don't know, I just had this feeling when I came to your site and that's when you know it's working.

[00:19:15.870] - Liz, Host
Okay. And so, you just need to cut them is the answer, partly. But let's talk a little more about color variations. What do you mean by that? And again, you don't want to have too many variations, but can you speak to that?

[00:19:30.560] - Michelle
What I mean is when you come to a site, I have a very strong blue. That's my brand color. It's this T shirt. And some people come to my social and they're like, wow, it's so much blue. Like, yeah, but my ideal client eats it up because they're not motivated. So that's where I support them right with the color. But when it comes to a website specifically, it's not necessarily all going to be that strong of your primary color. So, usually what we do is we have a formula to break it down throughout your website.

[00:19:59.720] - Michelle
Okay. Decrease the saturation by 30% here, 60% here, bring down your contrast, etcetera, so that you can have it a little bit more muted throughout the pages of your site and not have it just be willbam. Does that make sense?

[00:20:14.930] - Liz, Host
Yes. Yes. Because you don't always want to willbam people?

[00:20:18.080] - Michelle
Not always my site does. But usually I haven't seen another site that really does as much as mine does. And I'm happy to share my screen and show you two examples if you think that would be helpful.

[00:20:27.460] - Liz, Host
Yes, please. I love screen share examples.

[00:20:31.110] - Michelle
Let's look at it. Okay. So, this is my friend Mario Lines. She's a Kajabi template designer. So, she, as you can see, her primary is yellow. Her secondary is a blue, but it's a more muted blue, kind of like in here. But as you can see as you go down, you have variations of yellow. You don't have it all this color, right? You have it desaturated here throughout the page. So, this is in the summer palette that aligns with her personality. Yellow is her primary color because she wants to help her ideal clients feel focused and hopeful for the future.

[00:21:17.130] - Michelle
So that's why she's chosen those colors. Then you click over to my site and it's like, bam, right. I'm in the winter palette. So, winter palette is burying your face. It's very, as you can see, saturated. It's very thick. And so we wanted it to have much more of a pop on screen. So, these are ideal clients that have used the color method. And here, we have some desaturation, but we also did it in kind of a funky scheme just to give it more of that color pop since that's my primary message.

[00:21:51.110] - Michelle
But you can see this blue. It's strong, but we adjusted it here, brought it down a little bit, and then you can see secondary is yellow.

[00:22:01.290] - Liz, Host
Yeah. So, very different blue and yellow sites.

[00:22:04.870] - Michelle
Yes. Very very different. You'd never think that they were related at all.

[00:22:09.900] - Liz, Host
And that's the way I'm questioning all my visuals now.

[00:22:13.650] - Michelle
That's good and bad, right?

[00:22:15.530] - Liz, Host
Yes.

[00:22:17.550] - Michelle
So, there's so many things that you can do with the colors on your site. And you know I'm shown brands over and over again that are feeling stuck. And it's usually because of either they have no intention behind their brand color. They don't know what it means. They don't know whether or not it attracts their ideal client or it's just the wrong shades. So, people send their Hex codes to me, and I look through them. And nine times out of ten, they're not in the same tone or color harmony palette.

[00:22:45.660] - Michelle
It's so frustrating because I'm saying they're going, it's so clear to me, but it's something I've learned over time. But it can be that easy. You were trying to put together Hex codes, and you chose one from winter, one from spring, one from autumn. And then we wonder why people are repelled from our brand, right? It's like, for example, most of us have the background of our web page of our blog, the pure white color, FFFFFF. And we then try to line up our colors to that.

[00:23:14.160] - Michelle
But if you are in the summer palette, like we saw in Maryland's website, that's not a pure white. That's more of an Ivory white. So that's what we should have as the background to complement our brand colors. This is how like incredible this process is. It's something so simple. You literally just click in your site and adjust the background color, but it can make all the difference for someone that's scrolling through your blog.

[00:23:37.770] - Liz, Host
Okay. Is there some trick that if you want to look at your Hex codes and be like, are they in the same tone? I just copy the Hex code. I don't actually know what any of the numbers and things mean. I know black and white, and I have the shortcut for my Hex codes set with my keyboard. But is there some Hex code that's just?

[00:24:00.690] - Michelle
This is kind of a groundbreaking saying that I've kind of put together over the last year. So, what I would recommend hop into the Visible Entrepreneur Facebook group, drop your Hex codes, let me look at them. That would probably be the simplest solution, just that I can give you the best feedback, especially on your primary colors, so you can have a little bit more direction. But you can absolutely research for yourself and maybe go, what are some palettes that I like, look around on Pinterest, see what they are, and just see.

[00:24:30.430] - Michelle
Like, for example, if all your colors have a yellow undertone, make sure that your white has a yellow undertone. If all of your colors have a blue undertone, make sure that you have more of a blue undertone in your way, it can be that easy as well.

[00:24:43.170] - Liz, Host
I'm excited to dig into a little bit and see what extent I need to adjust. That because I feel like I definitely do.

[00:24:52.350] - Liz, Host
Alright.

[00:24:52.870] - Liz, Host
So, is there any sort of final bit of advice you want to share or that people should know about this? I feel like it's going to require me to Google a lot. Absolutely.

[00:25:04.500] - Michelle
I would say be sure to find a mentor that knows about this stuff. Otherwise it's going to take you too much time doing the research. It's going to be probably a little bit frustrating. So, find someone that you can study under and then just set aside an hour a week to work on it. This does not have to be all consuming if it brings you joy and excitement, dive into it, because maybe you need a little break from your blog or from your business. But this is all meant to bring you and your customer, your audience more ease.

[00:25:35.760] - Michelle
So, if that's something that you're looking for, then this might be a good time investment for you. But the great news is you know you're running your blog. You can make an announcement to your email list of this change is coming, get them in on it, get them excited. That's the greatest thing is that you can make this a journey that not only you but your audience craves and gets to see the change.

[00:25:56.310] - Liz, Host
Yes, yes, and you do, of course, if people just want to have one place to go, pause for a second, and I'll admit this out. So, I'm going to set you up for your call to action for people that use it free. I don't recall. Let me see. Oh, I don't have written down if you were going to contribute to the proposal or not.

[00:26:16.650] - Michelle
I think I responded and said I was. I can contribute the color kit. Okay.

[00:26:24.330] - Liz, Host
Color kit would be perfect. So, we'll do your call to action, and then if you get the proposal, you can get.

[00:26:34.330] - Michelle
Sounds great.

[00:26:34.590] - Liz, Host
Alright. And I think you have something for those watching. You want to tell us a little bit about it?

[00:26:39.510] - Michelle
Yes. If you're excited to go more in depth and you want to take a quick quiz to see what your next steps are, you can take the color quiz. We will drop that link below for you, SEO, that you can take that and just get a quick little preview of what maybe your brand should look like.

[00:26:53.350] - Liz, Host
I'm probably going to have to take that. And then you also have something for our pro pass holders. You want to tell us about that?

Absolutely. So, you are going to get my color kit. This is the basics of color psychology. I'm going to walk you through the difference between branding and color psychology. I'm going to give you an overview of tonal color harmony, and you're actually going to be able to hop onto Canva with my template and start experimenting with your brand colors. And I will walk you through some other brands and what those combinations look like in the different tone, so you can get some inspiration.

That's fantastic. I'm excited about that. Again, Michelle, thank you so much. I learned a lot. I feel like I have just so much more to learn, and I'm looking forward to so thank you so much.

Absolutely. Thank you for your time. And I hope that people have gotten a little inspired from this session.

Me too. I'm sure we're going to see a lot of Hex codes coming.

Awesome. I can't wait.
