Jenn Zellers [00:00:11]:
Hey there. I am so excited that you are here to learn about how to create a sustainable marketing system through speaking and collaborations. So before we dive in, I do want to go ahead and define what a sustainable marketing system is. So we're gonna look at real quick overview before we get into all the details of it, what the main pieces of this sustainable marketing system are. And over here, we call those your visibility ecosystem. So the first ingredient is your seeds. You have to plant your seeds, which are your speaking and your collaboration opportunities. So those are gonna be things like speaking on guest podcasts, which we'll get into all of that kind of stuff in a few.

Jenn Zellers [00:00:49]:
And then after you've planted those seeds, you need to nurture them because they do take some help to grow and to become those lovely little sprouts and seedlings that are going to grow into fruit for your business and your blog. And then the last thing is that growth, and that is where your visibility ecosystem, your sustainable marketing system really comes into play. Because it is going to allow you to start getting those speaking invites and those collaboration invites inbound instead of you having to go pitch yourself all the time. Alright. So now that we have that all defined, I just wanna introduce myself real quick. Hi. I'm Jenn. I'm a sustainable marketing strategist over at Visibility Ecosystem, where we create sustainable marketing systems for online business owners like you.

Jenn Zellers [00:01:36]:
I'm also a dog mom. I've got 2 Australian Shepherds and love doing agility with them, and I'm also a dragon nerd. So if you have any really good fantasy or sci fi books, especially if they involve dragons, please send them my way because I need some new recommendations. Okay. Let's go ahead and dive right in now. So we're going to look at that first part of your visibility ecosystem. This is your seeds. This is where you're planting those seeds through speaking and collaborations.

Jenn Zellers [00:02:05]:
So some examples of what your speaking opportunities might be would be guest podcasting, where where you go and you appear on someone else's podcast as a guest expert. You could be speaking at virtual summits, whether it's doing a presentation like I'm doing here, or you might end up going and doing a panel or an interview or whatever it happens to be for that particular summit, but you are appearing as guest expert there as well. And then there's just being a guest expert. And that typically, for my clients anyway, is things like appearing in a membership or a group program or a mastermind as a guest expert, typically presenting something in their area of expertise, and then often having a bit of a q and a portion afterward, which is really where the juicy stuff comes in. And often they find a lot of their marketing assets will which we'll get into in the next section. But then there's also collaborations. And this is not something that people necessarily think of as a speaking opportunity, but it really is. And they build into your blog and your business in the same way.

Jenn Zellers [00:03:10]:
So that could be joint webinars or email swaps where you go and you write an email for someone else's list and they write an email for your list and you each send the other person's email so that the audience is getting some information and value that they might not be able to get from the person whose list they're subscribed to. And they get introduced to someone new who they may want to follow. You could also do social media lives with people, round tables. The list could go on. I've got a whole collaboration menu that I use for myself and my clients, and you can create one too of all the different collaboration opportunities that you want to be part of. The next step in your Visibility Ecosystem is Nurture. This is where we're going to take your speaking and collaboration opportunities and get those seeds planted so they can start to grow. This is things like creating Instagram posts, Facebook posts, content for LinkedIn.

Jenn Zellers [00:04:05]:
There's so many different types of content over there. TikToks and Reels. You could do audiograms or use the actual video that you record from your speaking and collaboration opportunities. You could write blog posts, emails, the list could go on with this as well. But these are where you go and you take that content that you have created through your speaking opportunities and your collaborations, and you turn them into something more. Something that is visible to people who may not have been in your sphere during the speaking opportunities and the collaborations so that you can get in front of even more people and help them learn about you, get value from what you share, and, you know, maybe want to have you come and speak on their stages as well. Speaking of which, that brings us to the growth phase. So this is where those seeds that you planted through your speaking and collaboration opportunities start to grow as you nurture them and start to bear their own fruit and blossom in their own way.

Jenn Zellers [00:05:04]:
So this could look like subscribers coming onto your email list. It could look like sales if you have affiliate marketing set up on your blog, or maybe you do have your own products, so you have a course or something like that. You may be finding new collaborators through this because people are seeing you and going, oh, I would really love to have something around that for my audience. Hey. How can we collaborate? And could I have you on my podcast? And things like that. And so that also grows your industry authority, helps you become known, drives traffic back to your blog, and that's where those other invitations also start to come in too. And then as you start to do that, I do want to go and dive into something that's a little bit of spicy take. Because I do believe very firmly that if you are not using a sustainable marketing system, you are probably spending more time than you really, really need to on your marketing efforts.

Jenn Zellers [00:06:01]:
So that means your emails, your blogs, your social media, especially. This is one of the biggest things I see with my clients as they go, I'm so tired of being on that hamster wheel that is social media, of having to go and do all of these different Instagram posts and reels and TikToks and all this stuff and creating it from scratch. When if you're using a sustainable marketing system, you are creating content that you can use on an ongoing basis. With my clients, we have a whole database that we create out of all of their content from their speaking and collaborations, and we use that on an evergreen basis. They don't have to retire it. It's not a one and done. You're not just posting about a podcast episode that you appeared on the week after it goes live. You're using that on an ongoing basis.

Jenn Zellers [00:06:52]:
So if you do a year's worth of podcast episodes and virtual summits and things like that, you're going to be building up a library of content that you can use. You're gonna be getting asked questions that can turn into blog posts and emails, and you're going to be able to grow your business so much more sustainably to get more traffic to your blog even easier than if you are creating all of that marketing content from scratch. So how do you actually get started with a sustainable marketing system? The way that I get my clients started is we create a podcast tour. We do that every quarter, aiming to get on typically 5 to 7 podcasts depending on what their goals are, how much traffic they're trying to drive, and things like that. You can set your own goals with that, but, usually, I'm reaching out to 20 to 30 podcasts, and we're getting anywhere between 5 to 10, sometimes more, depending on the time of year and things like that, yeses back from those podcast hosts. Then we're creating a recyclable presentation. So that means that you have a presentation that you don't have to create from scratch every time. This is one of the biggest frustrations my clients have with speaking on virtual summits, and it's one of the things that we love working with them on when we are working on their retainer packages or when they are joining us inside of the planting seeds group program that we have.

Jenn Zellers [00:08:15]:
Because we are able to take it and make it into something that they don't have to rerecord all the time, that they can change how they're speaking over the slides rather than having to record the entire presentation. So it makes it so much easier, and it has kind of blown some of our clients' minds because they have been recording an entire new presentation. They've been creating new slides or at least doing a lot of adaptations to the slides that they have in order to create a new presentation every time, and it's really not necessary. So you can create a recyclable presentation. We'll go into all of this in a bit more depth in a second. And then you have to be sharing your speaking opportunities. This is where that nurture phase comes in and is what gets you all of those inbound invites, which is the last thing that you'll want to do to get started is set yourself up for those inbound invites. Alright.

Jenn Zellers [00:09:08]:
So diving in, let's look at your podcast tour. So the process for this is gonna be finding 20 to 30 right fit podcasts. At Visibility Ecosystem, we are all about quality, not quantity. I have seen far too many people who have hired a PR agency or something like that, and they pitch them to a 100 podcasts, which sounds amazing. Except, maybe this person works with moms of autistic children. That's what their blog is about. And this person is pitching them to male attorneys who don't have kids. And it's just a really, really bad fit.

Jenn Zellers [00:09:48]:
And so you have to be making sure that you are pitching quality podcasts that have the right fit for your audience, the right fit for your topic. And then you need to write customized e pitch emails for every single one. And I know that sounds like a lot, but there are ways to get that time down so that it's not taking up all of your time. And the more you do of them, the easier it's gonna be. I actually created an entire process for myself as I work with our No Fuss Podcast Tour clients So that it cuts down the time, but it also makes every single email customized to that podcast. They're not getting the same email that anyone else is getting, and that is going to increase the chances of getting a yes from those podcast hosts. And And then you have to actually send those podcast pitch emails because if you don't send them, obviously, you're not gonna get any yeses. And I know that can be really scary.

Jenn Zellers [00:10:37]:
So you could go and hire someone to do it, something that we end up doing for our clients, but you don't have to. If you're really nervous about doing it, lend your inbox to a friend for the day. Say, hey, when you have your podcast pitch emails written, let's swap inboxes for a half an hour today and send each other's pitch emails. And that way, you don't have to get nervous about sending them. Someone else is gonna do it, and you can't tell them to stop because they need you to do it too. So getting some accountability with sending out those pitch emails can be really, really helpful for you. And then you also need to track the status of each podcast that you are pitching. So that means that you need to have a centralized database or some way to keep track of how these podcast pitches are doing.

Jenn Zellers [00:11:23]:
Has it been sent? Have they responded back? Have you sent out 3 replies to those emails to follow-up with them, and they still haven't responded? And so maybe you decide that it's not worth it. I'm gonna go ahead and put that one on ice for the moment. But you need somewhere like that, so that's why we have a visibility ecosystem hub for our clients. We set that up in Airtable. That is my preferred platform for this type of thing. But if you have something that works better for you, if you use Trello or Asana or something that lets you keep track of all of that, then use whatever works for you. Just make sure that you are tracking those so that you don't lose any because that really, really sucks when someone comes back and goes, oh, I really wish that I had seen this, but I'm already booked out on podcast guests now. And then as those yeses start coming through, you gotta start recording those podcast episodes.

Jenn Zellers [00:12:11]:
But that's where the fun part starts. So let's take a look at how this grows your blog. So as you go on a podcast tour, you're gonna be making new connections. Each of those podcast hosts is a potential collaborator, and you are then also getting in front of other people because people are listening to the podcast episodes, and they may be saying, oh, I would love to get that topic in front of my audience as well, and they'll reach out to you for inbound invites through that. You're also increasing your confidence. I cannot tell you how much podcast episodes can boost your confidence when you go and record that episode and the host hits stop recording, And they go, oh my gosh. That was amazing. I was taking notes, and now I'm gonna go implement that in my business too or implement that in my life, whatever your topic happens to be.

Jenn Zellers [00:13:01]:
It also helps you hone your topic. The more questions that you get asked about your topic, the more you're going to realize, oh, I actually know what I'm talking about, which increases your confidence, but it's also going to help you really deep dig into the things that people are asking about your topic. So that way, you know, okay, these are the things that people are really interested in. A good host is going to be putting themselves in their listener shoes so that they know what their audience is gonna be asking, and they can kind of ask those questions for them. So as you go on a podcast tour, you're going to really hone in on your topic, and it is going to also help you use that honing to create more blog posts and other content around the topic and the questions that you're being asked about it. Alright. So then diving into how to recycle recycle your presentation, because this is one that not a lot of people talk about. And it is one of the most underutilized ways to actually make speaking at summits and other places where you need a presentation most of the time actually profitable.

Jenn Zellers [00:14:08]:
So what you'll do is you will create your base presentation. So that is your base slides, or if you do really technical stuff, like I used to do Google Analytics topics, you may decide, okay. These are the ways that I'm gonna walk through it, and you have all of the links to the pages that you're gonna use for the walkthroughs. Whatever it happens to be, create your base presentation and your speaking outline. And then you're gonna duplicate that for different audiences. So you can record the main presentation one time, and then you can just go ahead and change some of the voice over, like how I'm talking right now over these slides, and find other ways to change it out to different audiences. So for example, as I'm talking to you as a blogger, the things I'm gonna tell you may be slightly different than the things I'm gonna tell an online coach. So you'll just adapt your stories and your speaking angles to your different audiences.

Jenn Zellers [00:15:09]:
And then you'll record new introductions and outros. So that is just saying, hi. I'm so and so, and giving a little bit of context. Maybe that is a little bit more in line with the the audience and what they are identifying with with you. And then you can update that as needed. So you might decide you need to rerecord the intro sometimes, but if you don't have your face on the slides like, I'm doing that right now because I'm playing around with some new tech, and so I wanted to do that. But I typically recommend for my clients to record their slides without any of their face on it. So that way, it is way easier to switch it out.

Jenn Zellers [00:15:52]:
If you're recording new intros and outros, it's not gonna look weird because you don't have to match your clothes. You're just having the intro and the outro, and those are gonna match, but there's nothing in between. And so that way, if you have to make edits, it's much, much easier. So how does having a recycled presentation grow your blog? Well, it saves you time. It saves you so much time. I have clients who said that they've stopped speaking at summits because it took too much time, and they weren't seeing the results that were commensurate with that time. And when we go and give them a recycled presentation, it saves them enough time that they can actually make the summons profitable. Plus, we have other strategies that help them get those into a more profitable space.

Jenn Zellers [00:16:37]:
It also improves your presentation skills because the more that you are presenting the same presentation, the easier it is going to be to speak on that topic, which is also why honing your topic through a podcaster is gonna be really, really helpful. But you're just gonna get better and better at presenting that recycled presentation and adapting the stories to the different audiences. It also establishes your authority because when you're speaking on the same topic, I typically recommend my clients use 1 to 3 topics as their primary topics, so that they become known for those. So you can have little tweaks to those and adapt them to different areas, but you want to have the same overall theme that you were talking about on a consistent basis. So that is recycling your presentation. And then sharing your appearances is the next one that we're gonna dive into. So this is creating the social media posts and using audiograms or video or quotes or different things from your speaking present your speaking opportunities and your collaboration opportunities in order to create those social media posts. You can also write emails and even your entire blog post based off of interviews that you're having or from summit presentations that you're doing that you realize, oh, I could have dived into this a little bit deeper.

Jenn Zellers [00:18:03]:
You'd be surprised how much you can get out of an interview or presentation that you can use for emails and blog posts. And then you have to make sure you're scheduling those assets, of course, because if you're not going and getting them out there, what good are they doing? And then you just get your rinse and repeat on Evergreen. So that is, like, where I said that my clients are given a database, an Airtable, where they can go and gather all of the social media assets and different speaking opportunities that they have. You wanna make sure that you have those for your marketing assets so you don't lose track of them and you can keep reusing them. Because, let's be real, most people are not gonna remember what you posted a year ago. So you can keep using those on an ongoing basis. So how does sharing these assets grow your blog? Well, like I've talked about before, it makes marketing easier, because you're not spending all your time creating these things from scratch. It also showcases your authority, again, because you are not only doing the speaking, but you are putting this content out there in front of people who may not have seen you speak, but are still going to get the value from it and recognize that you know what you're talking about.

Jenn Zellers [00:19:13]:
And then it will also increase your speaking invites because, again, people see you speaking, but especially because they see you sharing. As a summit and podcast host myself, I can tell you that this is not something most guests do. So if you are sharing your speaking opportunities and your collaboration opportunities, more people are going to want to invite you onto their stages and in front of their microphones because they see that you're going to actually support what they're doing and share with your audience. Alright. So I also want to make sure that we bust some myths because this there's some things that I hear quite a lot, and you might be thinking them too. So in case you're thinking, yeah. I don't think this really applies to me. Here we go.

Jenn Zellers [00:19:57]:
So first off, I hear a lot things like no one wants to hear me on a podcast, or I don't think anyone's actually gonna say yes if I pitch them. That is absolutely true if you never pitch anybody. So my challenge to you today is to go out and pitch someone. Just say, hey. I've been listening to your podcast for a while, and I've noticed that you haven't had anyone on to speak about x y z topic. Or maybe they have had someone on to speak about it, but they haven't done it from quite the same angle that you've got. So just go and ask. It doesn't hurt, and the worst they can do is say no or not respond.

Jenn Zellers [00:20:36]:
Next up, I hear that virtual summits don't work anymore. This one comes up a lot, and I know I've mentioned it already that a lot of people think that they don't work because they are putting too much time into their presentations, or they are not approaching it with the right strategies. We teach this sleaze free sales framework here at Visibility Ecosystem so that you can actually make sales without feeling all gross about it. And so when you go into virtual summits with a recyclable presentation, with a sleaze free sales framework, and other strategies, you can actually get a return on the investment of time that you're putting into it. So don't think that just because summits are a little bit more work than a podcast interview, they're not worth it. I've gotten 4 figure sales from speaking at summits, and you can drive a lot of traffic to your blog and make sales too. I also hear that everybody's tired of webinars, which it is true. We are.

Jenn Zellers [00:21:33]:
We are tired of webinars that don't give value and that just generally are not worth attending. But if you are putting on a joint webinar as a collaboration with someone where their audience is hungry for what you talk about and you make sure that you're actually providing value and it's not a pitch fest, it's more of a workshop or something to that effect, then 15 minutes of teaching and 30 minutes of selling, you're gonna be providing value. You're gonna be able to create marketing assets based off of it, and it is going to grow your blog. So that is kind of a quick overview and some deep dives into some of the steps that go into creating a sustainable marketing system, or as we call it a visibility, ecosystem around here. And I would love to hear what you think about that. So definitely go ahead and find me on threads, and let me know your thoughts on this. And I would love to support you as you go ahead and create your visibility ecosystem and have a sustainable marketing system for your blog. So get in touch, and let's talk more.

Jenn Zellers [00:22:42]:
Can't wait to hear what you think, and hope you enjoy the rest of the summit.
