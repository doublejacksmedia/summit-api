Transcript:
Liz Stapleton [00:00:00]:
All right, guys, I'm super pumped for this session with Carly Campbell, who I've been listening to for Pinterest strategies for a long time. So thank you, Carly, for doing this. I'm really excited to have you here.

Carly Campbell [00:00:10]:
Oh, thank you for having me. I love talking about Pinterest, so I'm excited to be here.

Liz Stapleton [00:00:14]:
Yes, I think we'll both have a lot to say. It'll be really fun. But can you just tell for the people that may not know you, which I find surprising, but for the people who may not know you, can you give us a little bit on your background and kind of how you came to be known as this Pinterest expert?

Carly Campbell [00:00:28]:
Well, it was an accident.

Carly Campbell [00:00:32]:
I started blogging in 2016.

Carly Campbell [00:00:34]:
I was attempting to make enough money.

Carly Campbell [00:00:37]:
From home to stay home with my kids just like the rest of us. And of course, nothing was happening.

Carly Campbell [00:00:42]:
And nothing was happening because that's what.

Carly Campbell [00:00:44]:
Happens when you start a blog. And so I devoted myself to figuring.

Carly Campbell [00:00:49]:
Out how to get Pinterest traffic. And.

Carly Campbell [00:00:54]:
One day I discovered that I.

Carly Campbell [00:00:58]:
Had probably been pinning just for, like.

Carly Campbell [00:01:00]:
Two months at that point. One day I discovered that if I.

Liz Stapleton [00:01:03]:
Did this, this, and this, and this.

Carly Campbell [00:01:05]:
Is back in 2016, I could get.

Carly Campbell [00:01:09]:
Instant traffic from Pinterest. I could get my page views from.

Carly Campbell [00:01:13]:
One or two to over 150 instantly by pinning.

Carly Campbell [00:01:18]:
And now the years have gone by.

Carly Campbell [00:01:21]:
And that has changed a little bit.

Carly Campbell [00:01:23]:
You can't generally get instantly 100 pages by pinning anymore. But I was hooked on Pinterest from that point on, and I really devoted myself to learning the platform and to following along with the changes that it's.

Carly Campbell [00:01:35]:
Made over the past few years.

Liz Stapleton [00:01:37]:
Yeah.

Carly Campbell [00:01:38]:
And I've established very good traffic from Pinterest.

Carly Campbell [00:01:40]:
My blog still gets more than 50%.

Carly Campbell [00:01:44]:
Of its traffic from Pinterest, and consistent like Pinterest traffic fluctuates, it goes up and down for sure, but you want.

Liz Stapleton [00:01:52]:
To compare it year over year to see if you're growing in the right direction, because especially niche wise, there are certain seasons that do better. Most niches have some kind of season.

Liz Stapleton [00:02:02]:
To them where it's going to be up and down. Absolutely.

Carly Campbell [00:02:05]:
And there are ways that you can insulate yourself against that on Pinterest over time. But certainly in the first year, there.

Carly Campbell [00:02:13]:
Is not a lot you can do about that.

Liz Stapleton [00:02:16]:
It just does that.

Carly Campbell [00:02:17]:
Yeah.

Liz Stapleton [00:02:18]:
So you got to be prepared for that.

Liz Stapleton [00:02:20]:
Yeah.

Liz Stapleton [00:02:21]:
Because I think I first stumbled upon.

Liz Stapleton [00:02:23]:
You somewhat early in my blogging career.

Liz Stapleton [00:02:28]:
Must have been that early with your Pinteresting strategies. I think it was part of, like, Genius Blogger's Toolkit one year or something.

Carly Campbell [00:02:35]:
Okay. In 2017, it was okay.

Liz Stapleton [00:02:37]:
There we go. And it was just like a different way to look at Pinterest. I don't think I'd really done a whole lot with Pinterest at that point. Like, I'd been pinning, but I was not seeing the kind of traction I want to. So I read your book and just made me think about things a little bit differently because I know you and I approach it from different directions because you're a big proponent of manual pinning. Yes, and I am not, but I think we come at it from the same direction because I think the problem with schedulers, like tailwind automating, is people just schedule and leave it alone and.

Liz Stapleton [00:03:08]:
They don't pay attention to it.

Liz Stapleton [00:03:10]:
If you're paying and manual pinning forces.

Liz Stapleton [00:03:12]:
You to really focus on it.

Liz Stapleton [00:03:15]:
I think with a scheduler, if you have it built into your system that you're paying attention to it, it's okay. I think you can do well with it. But it's that problem of people don't yes.

Carly Campbell [00:03:25]:
And I mean, there are thousands of.

Carly Campbell [00:03:28]:
Tailwind success stories, so you have to know that there are people getting traffic using tailwind. I personally haven't been able to make tailwind give me and I mean, when I say, like, oh, I don't get traffic from tailwind, maybe the truth is I don't get as much traffic from tailwind as I do manual pinning. So to me, it doesn't seem good enough.

Liz Stapleton [00:03:48]:
Yeah.

Carly Campbell [00:03:48]:
And so I still now default to manual pinning. I actually turned off tailwind again yesterday because I was so disappointed in what it was producing. I went back and I looked at what tailwind had pinned for me in.

Carly Campbell [00:04:02]:
The past 28 days, and it's not.

Carly Campbell [00:04:05]:
A lot because it doesn't pin out a lot, but it pinned out some. And there was nothing that tailwind had.

Carly Campbell [00:04:09]:
Put out for me that had gotten more than four repins. But when I had manually pinned out.

Carly Campbell [00:04:15]:
Those pins from post, I was getting 300, 400 repins on those pins. And I cannot explain why what I do wrong with tailwind, but I still am pretty devoted to manual pinning.

Liz Stapleton [00:04:33]:
Yes. And I mean, I think it's important to know.

Liz Stapleton [00:04:36]:
So a lot of things people get.

Liz Stapleton [00:04:39]:
Mixed up when it comes to pitchers, because I get this with people who are looking for a pinterest man or something, and I'm not taking clients, so no one reach out to me about that is they're like, I want to grow my followers, or I want to get more repins.

Liz Stapleton [00:04:51]:
And it's like, that's not really the point of pinterest.

Liz Stapleton [00:04:54]:
Like, yes, you could do those things, but the end of the day is.

Liz Stapleton [00:04:57]:
You want the click through.

Liz Stapleton [00:04:59]:
Absolutely. And pay attention to I think one.

Carly Campbell [00:05:02]:
Of the most detrimental things that happens with tailwind is we create these pins, we put them in tailwind, and like you were saying, you're not really in there, you're not invested, you're not watching.

Liz Stapleton [00:05:11]:
And you don't I said, if you do go in and are paying attention, that's okay.

Liz Stapleton [00:05:18]:
A lot of people don't.

Carly Campbell [00:05:19]:
Yeah, that's right.

Carly Campbell [00:05:19]:
And the people who don't go in.

Carly Campbell [00:05:21]:
And pay attention, I think what they don't necessarily realize is that their pins are bad and they're repinning bad pins over and over and over and over on autopilot, wondering why just putting them out there isn't doing anything.

Carly Campbell [00:05:35]:
And it has nothing to do with.

Carly Campbell [00:05:37]:
The fact of where they're putting them or when they're putting them. And it has to do with the.

Carly Campbell [00:05:40]:
Fact that the Pin is bad.

Liz Stapleton [00:05:42]:
Yeah.

Carly Campbell [00:05:43]:
Or it's going out with bad keywords.

Carly Campbell [00:05:44]:
Over and over and over again.

Liz Stapleton [00:05:46]:
So let's take a second and let's.

Liz Stapleton [00:05:48]:
Talk about what is a good Pin.

Carly Campbell [00:05:50]:
What is a good pin?

Carly Campbell [00:05:51]:
That is a loaded question.

Liz Stapleton [00:05:53]:
It sure is. I mean, there's a lot of aspects to it, right? You've got the graphic, you've got the call to action in the title. That you've got the keywords, you've got the description, you've got maybe hashtags. Although I've been experimenting with not hashtags, I feel like they're fading.

Carly Campbell [00:06:08]:
I have quit hashtags. I completely not doing the hashtags in October.

Liz Stapleton [00:06:12]:
Yeah.

Liz Stapleton [00:06:13]:
Not long after that, I was like, you know what? These pins that don't have hashtags can be doing better.

Carly Campbell [00:06:21]:
I will say I have not seen a decline anywhere since quitting hashtags. I saw a definite, definite uptick to begin with, but I don't think it was related. I think it was very seasonal. And since then, I've leveled back down because the seasonal stuff is dead.

Carly Campbell [00:06:37]:
But I don't feel like that's got anything to do with hashtags.

Liz Stapleton [00:06:40]:
Yeah, because I feel like Pinterest invested in hashtags. Right. And from an engineering standpoint, the reality is that people searching on Pinterest aren't using hashtags.

Liz Stapleton [00:06:51]:
And so it wasn't really that's.

Liz Stapleton [00:06:53]:
Right.

Carly Campbell [00:06:53]:
Everything comes back to user intent. What is the end user doing?

Carly Campbell [00:06:58]:
And when you mentioned earlier click throughs.

Carly Campbell [00:07:00]:
What is it about our Pin? What makes a good Pin that is.

Carly Campbell [00:07:03]:
Going to encourage a user to click through it?

Carly Campbell [00:07:06]:
And that right there is what a good Pin is. But there's so much in there. So can the user read your Pin when they're scrolling on their phone?

Liz Stapleton [00:07:14]:
Because that's where they get small.

Liz Stapleton [00:07:15]:
Because a lot of lars, I always tell them, because I do mine in Google Slides, don't look at the slide, look at the thumbnail inside. See it?

Carly Campbell [00:07:24]:
Yeah, that's exactly it. After you Pin that thing, go straight to your phone. If you're not in Google Slides, and.

Liz Stapleton [00:07:29]:
It's hard to look at them as.

Carly Campbell [00:07:31]:
Well, go straight to your phone and.

Carly Campbell [00:07:32]:
Check it out and look at what it looks like in one inch by half an inch.

Carly Campbell [00:07:37]:
Because if you cannot read that text on that Pin, and text is really important for a click through, you can.

Carly Campbell [00:07:43]:
Get a lot of saves on a.

Carly Campbell [00:07:46]:
Pin that has no text.

Carly Campbell [00:07:47]:
Yes, but that text is your call to action. It's your thing that's going to encourage.

Carly Campbell [00:07:52]:
Somebody to click, tell them what's on.

Carly Campbell [00:07:53]:
The other side of that picture.

Carly Campbell [00:07:56]:
So reading it is so important on a phone, which means that the contrast between your image and your text has to be good. You have to be really careful about.

Carly Campbell [00:08:05]:
Script fonts versus clear bold, especially for niches.

Carly Campbell [00:08:13]:
This is the one that always gets.

Carly Campbell [00:08:15]:
Me, like, travel niches or food niches, where the sorry.

Liz Stapleton [00:08:20]:
I feel like they're always using scripts.

Carly Campbell [00:08:23]:
Always scripts, but also where the end.

Carly Campbell [00:08:26]:
User doesn't always use the word as a regular part of their vocabulary. So, like the name of an Italian town.

Carly Campbell [00:08:35]:
If you're planning a trip to Italy.

Carly Campbell [00:08:36]:
And you're searching on Pinterest, you might.

Carly Campbell [00:08:38]:
Know that name, kind of.

Carly Campbell [00:08:41]:
You kind of know that you're looking for Italian town names, and if you.

Carly Campbell [00:08:44]:
See it written out in non cursive, what's that called? Why am I blanking on this plain font?

Carly Campbell [00:08:53]:
Your brain will immediately understand what you're.

Carly Campbell [00:08:56]:
Reading, but if you have to slow.

Carly Campbell [00:08:58]:
Down to read it in script font, the user is going to default to clicking on the Pin right next to yours, competing with yours that they read first.

Carly Campbell [00:09:08]:
If yours is in font, they're going.

Carly Campbell [00:09:09]:
To click on the one they can read first. I'm trying to think of the name of an Italian town that would be difficult to read. I haven't been to a ton of Italian. Rome is not a good example because.

Liz Stapleton [00:09:23]:
Rome could be in a scripty font to read sorry, tuscany in a scripty tuscany?

Liz Stapleton [00:09:29]:
Yeah.

Carly Campbell [00:09:29]:
You probably don't use that word every.

Carly Campbell [00:09:31]:
Day, but if you're looking for Tuscany.

Carly Campbell [00:09:33]:
Vacation ideas, the ones that are easy to read, you're going to click on them first. Make that font bigger, too.

Carly Campbell [00:09:40]:
Fill the space that you have in that.

Liz Stapleton [00:09:44]:
Sticking with our Italy travel example. Right. If your Pin is clearly says Tuscany travel ideas or whatever in that description, because they may not be searching Tuscany specifically, you want to use Tuscany in your description. Yes. But you also want to be like if you're looking for some great travel ideas when you go to Italy yes. These are fantastic things to do in Tuscany.

Carly Campbell [00:10:06]:
Totally.

Liz Stapleton [00:10:07]:
So that the keyword that they're searching, because they're probably looking at, like, Italy travel ideas.

Carly Campbell [00:10:12]:
Totally.

Liz Stapleton [00:10:13]:
Tuscany.

Carly Campbell [00:10:14]:
But yeah, if you get into there.

Carly Campbell [00:10:16]:
I'm super geek about this. I'm not a super geek about much, but this will get me. If you get into the engineering blog.

Carly Campbell [00:10:24]:
On Pinterest, they explain that it's different than Google.

Carly Campbell [00:10:28]:
Google has, like Google reads what you write and they take into consideration, especially now, since they're one of their more recent updates, they read those little words. Pinterest applies, I think, what they call.

Carly Campbell [00:10:42]:
Ngrams to your pins, which are strings of six or less words, not including the ands.

Carly Campbell [00:10:52]:
But, ifs, the way that Google does. Pinterest does include those, and they'll include the most relevant. They rank them in relevancy. So if your Pin is very about.

Carly Campbell [00:11:02]:
Tuscany, tuscany might be its number one ngram.

Carly Campbell [00:11:07]:
But Italian city, Italian vacation, European holiday.

Carly Campbell [00:11:14]:
All of those strings of keywords, if.

Carly Campbell [00:11:17]:
You take the time to make sure.

Carly Campbell [00:11:18]:
They're applied to your Pin, can be.

Carly Campbell [00:11:21]:
Applied to your Pin and your Pin can surface.

Carly Campbell [00:11:23]:
I got a hood on my shirt.

Carly Campbell [00:11:24]:
That'S driving me up. Your Pin can surface in searches for those things also.

Carly Campbell [00:11:30]:
And that is so much more traffic than just Tuscany.

Liz Stapleton [00:11:33]:
Yeah.

Carly Campbell [00:11:35]:
It's really thinking about, okay, and I've.

Liz Stapleton [00:11:37]:
Been guilty of this in the past, too. I'm actually going to completely redo Pinterest stuff because I rebranded, in a way. But you need to think, okay, it's not just what other bloggers are going.

Liz Stapleton [00:11:48]:
To repin it, it's the users that.

Liz Stapleton [00:11:50]:
Are actually using it. Bloggers. We are in Pinterest in a completely different way.

Carly Campbell [00:11:57]:
Absolutely.

Liz Stapleton [00:11:58]:
People using it. And so you have to really try to step back and be like, okay, well, how do I use Pinterest when I'm searching for something for my secret board?

Carly Campbell [00:12:07]:
Yes, I have a secret board called.

Carly Campbell [00:12:09]:
Mine, and I Pin everything that's mine to it, because I don't want to put my stuff into my feed.

Liz Stapleton [00:12:15]:
But yeah, it doesn't make sense. Exactly.

Carly Campbell [00:12:17]:
Totally. So it's actually interesting that you say that, because one of my earliest successes.

Carly Campbell [00:12:24]:
On Pinterest and before I didn't know anything about Pinterest, was a Pin that.

Carly Campbell [00:12:31]:
I created from the perspective of what.

Carly Campbell [00:12:34]:
Would I like to click on if I was using Pinterest right now? And the longer I've been blogging and.

Carly Campbell [00:12:40]:
The longer I've been doing Pinterest, some.

Carly Campbell [00:12:42]:
Days I feel like I struggle to connect to that person that was just using Pinterest as a user. And I think that is a serious detriment to me. I just said to a friend the.

Carly Campbell [00:12:54]:
Other day, I said something about this.

Carly Campbell [00:12:57]:
Pin while I was whining, and she was like, well, it just doesn't wow me. Why would I click on it? And I said, Sometimes I cannot even.

Carly Campbell [00:13:04]:
Remember what it was like to use.

Carly Campbell [00:13:06]:
Pinterest as a user. And so one of the best things that we can do is set up a Pinterest account for ourselves, not for a blog, and use it. Use the account for whatever you are passionate about, whether it's cooking or DIY.

Liz Stapleton [00:13:20]:
Or even I mean, so I have enough Pinterest accounts with my two blogs. I have multiple secret boards, and I use Pinterest, my business one or whatever, and I will save things to my secret board. So it's not messing with my feed.

Liz Stapleton [00:13:37]:
But not kind of what my profile.

Liz Stapleton [00:13:39]:
Is putting out there or something.

Carly Campbell [00:13:40]:
What the outside world sees.

Liz Stapleton [00:13:41]:
Yeah, what the outside world sees. Exactly. But it's just reminds me of how to search and what things you see and how you use it, because I look for ideas on things I'm like organization ideas, which has nothing to do with my blog. Right. It's like I'm trying to get my closet organized or something, and it's just yeah, so have some secret boards or.

Liz Stapleton [00:14:03]:
Have a separate profile.

Carly Campbell [00:14:05]:
Definitely.

Liz Stapleton [00:14:06]:
And use it.

Liz Stapleton [00:14:08]:
Use Pinterest as a user.

Liz Stapleton [00:14:10]:
Not just I think that's a great tip.

Carly Campbell [00:14:12]:
Absolutely. It was really interesting, too, when you.

Carly Campbell [00:14:17]:
Use as a user to think about it from the point of a click through. What am I saving for the inspiration image on the Pin? What am I saving for the information on the other side of the Pin? Because if you're looking for let's use home decor for an example.

Carly Campbell [00:14:33]:
You'll save a lot of Pins for what's on the Pin or fashion and never click through.

Carly Campbell [00:14:39]:
And understanding when you're going to click through and when you're not going to click through will help you to design.

Carly Campbell [00:14:44]:
Pins that somebody's going to click through. Yeah, and that's another thing, I think.

Liz Stapleton [00:14:50]:
Because a lot of people will just save Pins for maybe they're like motivational quotes or whatever, because you see that in space, right, and they'll get a ton. They're never getting clicked on, no through. So if you see it because especially since Pinterest does make this public, they're like monthly viewers or whatever they're calling.

Carly Campbell [00:15:07]:
It now, doesn't mean anything.

Liz Stapleton [00:15:09]:
They could have millions of monthly viewers because they have stuff that gets repinned all the time or saved, but never clicked on and have hardly any traffic.

Carly Campbell [00:15:19]:
That's such a good point. I actually just had a discussion about.

Carly Campbell [00:15:25]:
This with somebody the other day, and she said, I have over 10 million monthly viewers and only 10,000 page views. And I was actually kind of shocked. I understand the concept that you've just said, I still equate, like, 10 million monthly viewers.

Carly Campbell [00:15:38]:
That must be, oh, at least 100,000 pages. But it wasn't, and the platform doesn't work that way.

Carly Campbell [00:15:45]:
And my account right now, oh, my account's awful.

Liz Stapleton [00:15:49]:
I'm like, don't look at mine, look.

Carly Campbell [00:15:50]:
At my I've been working really hard on it this past three weeks because I saw such a decline when my seasonal stuff dropped off and I've managed to bump it fell to 2.8 million viewers, and I've got it back up to 3 million right now.

Carly Campbell [00:16:09]:
But my page views have only increased.

Carly Campbell [00:16:12]:
About 500 a day, certainly not 200,000 a day.

Liz Stapleton [00:16:19]:
Yeah.

Liz Stapleton [00:16:19]:
So don't play the comparison game there. Don't think that it could be someone that has way less monthly viewers, but they have a way higher click through rate because they're just totally focused. So don't stress that. And it's kind of like it's playing the same game of trying to get.

Liz Stapleton [00:16:37]:
A certain number of followers.

Liz Stapleton [00:16:39]:
At the end of the day, the click through rate is what and one.

Carly Campbell [00:16:45]:
Interesting thing about followers is understanding that.

Carly Campbell [00:16:48]:
Follower engagement follower engagement matters more than.

Carly Campbell [00:16:52]:
The number of followers. So if you have ten followers and seven of them are engaging with your Pins, that is so much better for you than if you have 100,000 followers.

Carly Campbell [00:17:02]:
And seven of them are engaging with your Pins. Because then Pinterest says, well, 70% of.

Carly Campbell [00:17:11]:
These people think she's relevant versus 0.7% of these people think that she's relevant, and your Pins will get into the.

Carly Campbell [00:17:18]:
Feed more if your followers are engaging with them.

Carly Campbell [00:17:24]:
Yeah, I would never worry about your number of followers, but worry about what will make your followers notice your pins.

Carly Campbell [00:17:30]:
That's what's important.

Carly Campbell [00:17:33]:
So I had a thought in my.

Carly Campbell [00:17:36]:
Brain, and it just kind of bubbled up and then it went away. Sorry.

Liz Stapleton [00:17:40]:
No, you're fine. This is the beauty of pre recording.

Carly Campbell [00:17:42]:
I can edit this out. Okay, great. I was going to say so obviously.

Carly Campbell [00:17:47]:
We're talking to people if they don't have a ton of followers yet, we're talking to people who are kind of at the starter kind of stage wondering, how can I get my pins out there if I don't have any followers engaging?

Carly Campbell [00:17:59]:
And one of the best things to.

Carly Campbell [00:18:01]:
Understand that I don't think a lot.

Carly Campbell [00:18:03]:
Of people talk about is board co occurrence. Okay, so do you use board co.

Carly Campbell [00:18:09]:
Occurrence in your Pinterest management as a strategy? Because not a lot of people do. It's really underutilized.

Liz Stapleton [00:18:15]:
I think I'm not familiar with that term.

Liz Stapleton [00:18:19]:
So I'm like, it could be I do, but don't call it that. I don't know.

Carly Campbell [00:18:23]:
Sure, that's possible.

Liz Stapleton [00:18:24]:
So I'm like, I'm not sure. So why don't you explain what it is to me? And I'll be like, yes, I do, or no, I don't because I'm not.

Liz Stapleton [00:18:30]:
Sure if I'm not familiar with that specific term.

Carly Campbell [00:18:32]:
Okay, so board co occurrence is actually a term from the Pinterest Engineering blog. I don't make up these words because I not smart enough. I don't speak engineer, but what it.

Carly Campbell [00:18:44]:
Means is pins occurring on the same board. So one of the best ways to.

Carly Campbell [00:18:51]:
Push your pins out into the feed when you're brand new and you are putting out your Pin for the first time, or you're putting out your first ten pins, why is Pinterest going to put those out there? You know, they're not actually based on the fact that they don't know what your Pin is about. They don't know what your count is about. So board co occurrence says that if these pins appear on the same board, they must have a relationship. So when you're introducing a brand new.

Carly Campbell [00:19:17]:
Pin to Pinterest and you're kind of new, create your new board, put a.

Carly Campbell [00:19:23]:
Good keyword on that board title.

Carly Campbell [00:19:26]:
Okay, that's 101.

Carly Campbell [00:19:27]:
We all know that.

Carly Campbell [00:19:28]:
So we're calling our board Easy Chicken Dinner ideas. And we've got Easy Chicken Dinner ideas in the description, too.

Carly Campbell [00:19:39]:
But now, if you introduce your easy.

Carly Campbell [00:19:41]:
Chicken dinner ideas pin to pinterest, and.

Carly Campbell [00:19:45]:
You put that brand new pin from your brand new account on your brand.

Carly Campbell [00:19:48]:
New board, pinterest goes, okay, it's probably.

Carly Campbell [00:19:52]:
About easy chicken dinner ideas because it says that in the title and it says that in the description and it says it in the description of the pin.

Carly Campbell [00:19:58]:
But Pinterest waits up to a week.

Carly Campbell [00:20:00]:
And sometimes longer before they actually go.

Carly Campbell [00:20:04]:
And catalog those pins and give them their final resting place in the algorithm of ngram.

Carly Campbell [00:20:12]:
Remember, those are those keywords that we talk about.

Carly Campbell [00:20:15]:
So they get primary data from the board title, from the board description.

Liz Stapleton [00:20:24]:
So I do do this. I look at the pins that are also which is why I also don't pin to board because I do pin to some group boards, but I'm always.

Carly Campbell [00:20:32]:
Checking because I'm like, if this one's.

Liz Stapleton [00:20:33]:
Being spammed, pinterest isn't going to know.

Carly Campbell [00:20:35]:
What my if it's a very heavily spammed board, your Pin will start to be related to spam pins when you create that new board search easy Chicken dinner ideas.

Liz Stapleton [00:20:47]:
Pin do that. You hit more ideas on the board page. And if it's showing stuff that you're like, yes, this is what goes on here. Just click and there you go. You got ten pins.

Carly Campbell [00:20:59]:
That's right, Pin.

Carly Campbell [00:21:00]:
Those third party Pins that Pinterest already believes are Easy Chicken Dinner ideas, pin.

Carly Campbell [00:21:05]:
Those to that board, and sometimes Pinterest.

Carly Campbell [00:21:08]:
Will email you, too. More ideas for your new board, easy Chicken ideas.

Carly Campbell [00:21:12]:
If those are right, pin them. If they're wrong, don't pin them, of course.

Carly Campbell [00:21:17]:
And then put your Pin on that board, because then your Pin is on the board occurring with these other Pins that Pinterest already has established in their brain.

Carly Campbell [00:21:27]:
And then it will start the more.

Carly Campbell [00:21:29]:
Often that it gets pinned to a board. So now my follower, my one follower Pins, one of those third party Easy Chicken Dinner ideas, and my third party.

Carly Campbell [00:21:39]:
Easy sorry, and my new Easy Chicken Dinner ideas, and now they occur in.

Carly Campbell [00:21:45]:
Pinterest brain on the same board twice.

Carly Campbell [00:21:47]:
And the more often that happens, the better for your Pin. Yeah, and I think that's also another.

Liz Stapleton [00:21:53]:
Good point as to doing more specific.

Carly Campbell [00:21:55]:
Boards rather than broader ones.

Carly Campbell [00:21:58]:
Yes.

Liz Stapleton [00:22:00]:
So instead of like dinner ideas, chicken dinner ideas, or pizza recipes or soup stews and chilies, or, you know, I have one of my clients, food bloggers, you know, these already, not just dessert cookies. And if you're looking at group boards, and again, some group boards get a bad rap, and I think because a lot of them are very generalized or they're spammed on. But I think if you can find a very topic specific board that's not being spammed, it can totally help you.

Carly Campbell [00:22:33]:
What is interesting about that, I just have to add this while you're saying.

Carly Campbell [00:22:38]:
This thing about I am still on.

Carly Campbell [00:22:40]:
A number of group boards.

Liz Stapleton [00:22:41]:
I don't pin to very many, but.

Carly Campbell [00:22:43]:
I have two Pins currently only.

Carly Campbell [00:22:46]:
Okay, so I made a terrible, terrible mistake, and we won't go into this, but in April of last year, I turned off my Rich Pins for a month.

Liz Stapleton [00:22:52]:
Yeah.

Carly Campbell [00:22:52]:
And it was a terrible mistake.

Carly Campbell [00:22:54]:
And all of my organic rankings went away.

Carly Campbell [00:22:57]:
I lost them all.

Carly Campbell [00:22:59]:
So I have two Pins that are ranking organically in Pinterest, bringing traffic every day, and they're both on group boards, topic specific group boards.

Liz Stapleton [00:23:08]:
Yes.

Carly Campbell [00:23:09]:
And they actually rank in the algorithm.

Carly Campbell [00:23:11]:
And bring one of them brings over.

Carly Campbell [00:23:14]:
1000 pages a week. And one of them brings over 500 pages a week. Big group boards, these are not tiny little, but they are super topic specific.

Liz Stapleton [00:23:24]:
Yeah.

Liz Stapleton [00:23:26]:
And if you run a group board, that's topic specific monitor it, go in every once in a while. This guy's spamming it or this one has nothing to do with it because I've done that. And when I was helping a friend go pinterest, I was looking towards I was like, you need to kick this person out of your group board because this isn't on topic.

Liz Stapleton [00:23:41]:
And they're spamming.

Liz Stapleton [00:23:42]:
And he's like, oh, I didn't even know. Like a lot of people that run boards sometimes forget to go look, but go look because it can make a big difference.

Carly Campbell [00:23:48]:
Yeah.

Carly Campbell [00:23:51]:
I don't have any group boards that I run because I'm not willing to put in the time to police them.

Liz Stapleton [00:23:57]:
I have one.

Carly Campbell [00:23:59]:
I do have one, but I don't run it because it's literally just like some very close friends at it.

Carly Campbell [00:24:04]:
Exactly.

Liz Stapleton [00:24:04]:
I was like, it's pretty small. Yeah, I'm not going to do like you get a warning. I'm just like, if I go in there, it looks like you're gone.

Carly Campbell [00:24:13]:
Absolutely.

Liz Stapleton [00:24:16]:
I don't have time for that.

Carly Campbell [00:24:17]:
No, you don't have time for that. And it's going to hurt everybody on the board.

Liz Stapleton [00:24:23]:
I think group boards, especially the last year or so, have gotten really bad raps. Everyone's like, leave group boards, don't do it's. Like no archive, don't pin to the ones that aren't good, but topic specific.

Liz Stapleton [00:24:35]:
That are in good shape.

Liz Stapleton [00:24:38]:
Absolutely can do a lot of there.

Carly Campbell [00:24:40]:
Is a place for them.

Carly Campbell [00:24:41]:
And honestly, does every pin I put.

Carly Campbell [00:24:46]:
On those group boards do well? No, but the fact that those two ranked makes it worth my time for every other pin I've ever put on there, you know what I mean?

Carly Campbell [00:24:58]:
Those two pins are bringing in passive.

Carly Campbell [00:25:01]:
Income all the time. It was worth the 30 seconds it.

Carly Campbell [00:25:04]:
Took me per day to put a.

Carly Campbell [00:25:06]:
Couple of pins on those boards.

Liz Stapleton [00:25:07]:
Absolutely. And I do want to jump back for a second because talk about rich.

Liz Stapleton [00:25:11]:
Pins, because.

Liz Stapleton [00:25:15]:
They're not for everybody. So in your niche, they're probably really good and you learn you shouldn't have turned them off. But for food bloggers where they're doing recipes, you typically don't want to do rich pin because I think you pull the recipe in.

Carly Campbell [00:25:31]:
And not only that food bloggers get we have to remember that different niches are different on Pinterest. Like I said earlier, DIY and home decor, a lot of people are saving those pins for ideas. They're not always clicking through unless it's a how to.

Liz Stapleton [00:25:44]:
And a lot of times DIY, I should say, is kind of like the food bloggers recipe. Right? If you have the steps working out, I wouldn't be rich pins because Pinterest is going to pull it over and you're never going to get the click through.

Carly Campbell [00:25:56]:
Yeah.

Carly Campbell [00:25:56]:
If you use a plugin that holds that information, they will steal it. And with food bloggers, because people are.

Carly Campbell [00:26:04]:
Pinning it's super, super competitive. But it's not the same as, say.

Carly Campbell [00:26:12]:
Pregnancy, where I am. Pregnancy, people look at the first few results and they click on the first few results. Food people scroll until they see one.

Carly Campbell [00:26:22]:
They like, they think, that looks yummy, I want that.

Liz Stapleton [00:26:27]:
Whereas DIY same thing. Oh, I want to make that. That looks really pretty, that suits my place. That's my style. Personal finance, because I have personal finance, so it's different, personal finance.

Carly Campbell [00:26:40]:
They probably click on the first few, just like pregnancy.

Liz Stapleton [00:26:44]:
With some exceptions, but generally speaking, yeah. And so you need to kind of really realize what your niche is on Pinterest and what those users are doing.

Liz Stapleton [00:26:54]:
Totally. What Pinterest users do. Things vary.

Liz Stapleton [00:26:57]:
What Pinterest pulls over varies depending on what you're doing. So like, yeah, I have rich Pinterest turned on mine, but I'm not doing recipes or DIY tutorials.

Carly Campbell [00:27:03]:
That's right.

Carly Campbell [00:27:05]:
If you think about it from the.

Carly Campbell [00:27:07]:
Perspective of just a picture of money.

Carly Campbell [00:27:11]:
Or just a picture of a pregnant.

Carly Campbell [00:27:12]:
Lady, you know, that or maybe in.

Carly Campbell [00:27:16]:
Your mind, that's not as important as.

Carly Campbell [00:27:18]:
A picture of the cookie you want.

Carly Campbell [00:27:20]:
To this is the cookie I'm making. This is the pregnant lady. She's kind of the same as me. I can click on that.

Liz Stapleton [00:27:26]:
No, I want to cook that you greeted. And you'll probably want to see before and after, or even just the after, where on YouTube you actually want to see the before as your thumbnail. And so it's different platforms, different things.

Carly Campbell [00:27:41]:
I don't know anything about YouTube and.

Liz Stapleton [00:27:42]:
I'm hoping I know very little. I learned a lot from the sessions we recorded.

Carly Campbell [00:27:46]:
Wow, I'm excited to watch that because I'm hoping to get a little bit into YouTube this year. Okay, that's new for me.

Carly Campbell [00:27:54]:
I'm hoping that because I understand Pinterest SEO and Google SEO, that YouTube will.

Liz Stapleton [00:28:00]:
Be like SEO will be a similar yeah, because they're all search engines. Right? It's video search, image search, and text search, typically, but they're all search engines, which is why we kind of tend to lump in Pinterest with social media. It's weird because Pinterest gets lumped in.

Carly Campbell [00:28:15]:
But YouTube doesn't usually, but it's I.

Carly Campbell [00:28:18]:
Haven't thought about that.

Liz Stapleton [00:28:19]:
Instagram, Twitter, Facebook.

Liz Stapleton [00:28:21]:
Totally different.

Carly Campbell [00:28:22]:
Yeah, definitely. I do think that until Pinterest gives.

Carly Campbell [00:28:30]:
Up on the idea that it's social.

Carly Campbell [00:28:31]:
Media, which they haven't in all these.

Carly Campbell [00:28:34]:
Years, but maybe they will soon. As long as they keep attempting to push those comment features, or now they've got like you can react to videos, little reactions. I do think that those have weight, unfortunately, and it's very hard to get.

Carly Campbell [00:28:49]:
Those to happen organically, and they seem.

Carly Campbell [00:28:53]:
To need to be organic to make a difference. I've tried threads with other bloggers where you comment. Or like each other's pins. It doesn't seem to make a difference.

Carly Campbell [00:29:01]:
Have you ever tried anything like that?

Liz Stapleton [00:29:03]:
I haven't. Mostly because I don't want to take the time. I ain't got time for that. No. And you know, there's someone that's not doing it and it's just like I very rarely do, like share for share threads, occasionally if I happen to see it and I'm like, oh yeah, I actually posted the summit to one today, and I was like, I'm going to have to go back and then show people.

Liz Stapleton [00:29:26]:
Yeah.

Liz Stapleton [00:29:27]:
So I very rarely do that. I do want to ask your thoughts, because this has been new in the.

Liz Stapleton [00:29:31]:
Last year or so, is video pins.

Carly Campbell [00:29:35]:
So I made some video pins and I put out my video pins and I was super hopeful for them.

Carly Campbell [00:29:40]:
And they got impressions and views. What they didn't get was click through. And my bottom line, like you said.

Carly Campbell [00:29:50]:
Earlier, comes down to the click through. And they don't get click throughs because you can't click on the video to.

Carly Campbell [00:29:56]:
Click through, you have to open the.

Carly Campbell [00:29:58]:
Pin, which I don't do. I actually laid in bed last night.

Liz Stapleton [00:30:00]:
And looked at a video pin, and.

Carly Campbell [00:30:02]:
Then I took a second to think about how I did it and I watched it without opening it, without making it bigger.

Carly Campbell [00:30:07]:
So the only way to click through.

Carly Campbell [00:30:09]:
A video pin is to enlarge it, scroll down and click the link. And everybody who uses Pinterest is trained to click the pin to click through on Pinterest.

Liz Stapleton [00:30:17]:
So what you get, you get people.

Carly Campbell [00:30:19]:
Tapping on your video pins, I think.

Carly Campbell [00:30:22]:
Not going anywhere, thinking you can't click through and they give up.

Carly Campbell [00:30:25]:
Now, if you promote .

Liz Stapleton [00:30:27]:
clicking the Read Button, yeah, you have to scroll down.

Liz Stapleton [00:30:30]:
And press the Read button. I guess because I'm used to it that way.

Carly Campbell [00:30:33]:
The video pin thing didn't throw me.

Carly Campbell [00:30:35]:
Okay, so if you promote a video.

Liz Stapleton [00:30:38]:
Pin, that's an automatic right through it.

Carly Campbell [00:30:44]:
I think that there is going to.

Carly Campbell [00:30:46]:
Be a lot of potential for promoted video pins with strong call to action. I don't think that there is going.

Carly Campbell [00:30:53]:
To be, for the average blogger, a.

Carly Campbell [00:30:58]:
Lot of benefit in regular video pins.

Carly Campbell [00:31:03]:
What I think so far, based on my experience.

Liz Stapleton [00:31:05]:
Yeah, I would have to agree with that because I've done some video pins and they do get a lot of impressions and I've done a couple of promoted video pins that have also done well because they can just.

Liz Stapleton [00:31:18]:
It's easier, but it's a mixed bag.

Liz Stapleton [00:31:23]:
I've also experimented with, okay, well, how long is the video for the video? So there's a lot of different factors and things to play with that maybe it is going to work really well for you. And it also depends what's the goal of that pin, because if you're a fashion blogger and you're tagging the products.

Liz Stapleton [00:31:38]:
In it, maybe you don't care if.

Liz Stapleton [00:31:41]:
They don't go to your site, you're.

Liz Stapleton [00:31:42]:
Still getting affiliate money.

Liz Stapleton [00:31:44]:
So I think it really kind of depends on, like you said, the user intent. Are they looking at it to learn something? In which case are they learning everything they need to in that video?

Liz Stapleton [00:31:54]:
Are they looking at it to buy something?

Liz Stapleton [00:31:56]:
Or are they looking at it like, maybe it's a snippet of the DIY? Like, okay, this looks easy enough.

Liz Stapleton [00:32:00]:
Let me go get the full tutorial for the recipe.

Liz Stapleton [00:32:06]:
What is their user intent? What are they trying to accomplish? And do they need something beyond the.

Liz Stapleton [00:32:11]:
Video you give them to do it?

Carly Campbell [00:32:13]:
Well, and I think if you mentioned recipe or DIY with a full tutorial, I think if you're doing that, just include a final slide on your video with an arrow that points down that says click Read More for full tutorial. Click Read more for the recipe. So that the people who don't know how to get to because if they're just clicking on that video, not getting anywhere.

Carly Campbell [00:32:36]:
If there's an arrow that points down.

Carly Campbell [00:32:38]:
Then you will find that Click to Read More link. Yeah, I would finish the video with that slide, but for the most part, I have abandoned videos for my niche. But I mean.

Carly Campbell [00:32:56]:
It's not that interesting to watch a video pin that's not.

Carly Campbell [00:33:01]:
DIY or recipe or fashion. Right. And so pregnancy postpartum, it doesn't really.

Carly Campbell [00:33:06]:
Lend itself to videos.

Carly Campbell [00:33:09]:
I don't think.

Carly Campbell [00:33:10]:
I've seen ones that people have done for baby wearing. Like, this is how you wrap your baby. But I didn't do baby wearing or wrap my baby because I dropped my baby once when I was trying to wrap my baby on me and never got over that.

Carly Campbell [00:33:21]:
It was I think it depends on.

Carly Campbell [00:33:25]:
The niche, like you said.

Liz Stapleton [00:33:26]:
Yeah, exactly. For sure. Productivity could be another one. It's like, here's the quick result where you can show a tangible result or something. Yes.

Liz Stapleton [00:33:36]:
Or video is going to you could.

Liz Stapleton [00:33:38]:
Get some traction from it, but you're going to get the most traction from a promoted one.

Carly Campbell [00:33:42]:
That's a great way to see it, where you can show a tangible result and then finish with a slide.

Carly Campbell [00:33:46]:
This is where you build action.

Liz Stapleton [00:33:48]:
Absolutely. Okay, so any other kind of thoughts.

Liz Stapleton [00:33:55]:
Or advice in terms of how people can start doing better with Pinterest? Because it is a lot to take on. I know we didn't have a ton.

Liz Stapleton [00:34:02]:
Of time, but I feel like hopefully we've given people a lot of

Carly Campbell [00:34:05]:
I feel good about what we've covered. I think, you know, what's interesting to.

Carly Campbell [00:34:09]:
Me, and I'm going to take this.

Carly Campbell [00:34:11]:
Back to kind of where we started, what makes a good pin? Because over and over and over again.

Carly Campbell [00:34:19]:
I get people who say, I've done.

Carly Campbell [00:34:21]:
This, this, and this and this on Pinterest and it's just not working now.

Carly Campbell [00:34:25]:
Okay.

Carly Campbell [00:34:25]:
The caveat is, is your niche going.

Carly Campbell [00:34:28]:
To do well on Pinterest? There are some niches that will never do well on Pinterest. I actually think that blogging as a niche, how to Make Money blogging is a very challenging niche on Pinterest. If you are getting 5000 pages a month or 10,000 pages a month to your how to Make Money blogging blog, that's pretty good.

Carly Campbell [00:34:50]:
Actually, if you are getting 5000 pages.

Carly Campbell [00:34:53]:
A month or 10,000 pages a month.

Carly Campbell [00:34:55]:
To your crafting blog, or your home.

Carly Campbell [00:34:57]:
Decor blog, or your recipe blog, there's.

Carly Campbell [00:35:01]:
Room for improvement if you feel like.

Carly Campbell [00:35:05]:
You are doing everything right in terms of Pinterest SEO. Pinterest SEO is really important. And I go really in depth in it, in Pinteresting strategies.

Liz Stapleton [00:35:16]:
But if you feel like if you've.

Carly Campbell [00:35:17]:
Done everything right that way, go back to your Pin design and your user intent. Even if you think your pins are good, your pins might be really bad.

Liz Stapleton [00:35:26]:
Ask someone else, ask another blogger, ask.

Liz Stapleton [00:35:29]:
Your family member or friend.

Liz Stapleton [00:35:31]:
Be like, hey, do you use Centrist? Would you stop at that?

Liz Stapleton [00:35:34]:
Yes.

Carly Campbell [00:35:35]:
Is this can you read this Pin on your phone? Would you click on this pin?

Liz Stapleton [00:35:40]:
Yeah. And keep that in mind because there are because I've seen them over and over again and they're great sort of guidelines, right, of bright colors and don't use faces and zoom in. You know, the ten things you always see all the time of how good pins be. Mindful of the stock images, make it related. There's a lot to that. And those are great guidelines. But sometimes all the pins on the page are pink.

Carly Campbell [00:36:05]:
Maybe you want to make yours blue.

Carly Campbell [00:36:07]:
That, you know, something that is never talked about.

Carly Campbell [00:36:09]:
And I did for kind of it's.

Carly Campbell [00:36:12]:
Something I don't ever do. I'm maybe going to get into it this year. I shouldn't say that out loud yet, but I did some pin critiques earlier this year and one of the guys.

Carly Campbell [00:36:22]:
That submitted his site for a pin critique I had never really thought about.

Carly Campbell [00:36:27]:
It before, but when I looked at the pins.

Carly Campbell [00:36:30]:
And when I searched the search results.

Carly Campbell [00:36:32]:
His pins were coming back in the search results. And they looked identical to every other pin that was on there. And looking at it kind of just looked like a wall of same thing.

Carly Campbell [00:36:41]:
Nothing was standing out. Like I wasn't going to click on.

Carly Campbell [00:36:44]:
Anything because nothing was getting my attention.

Liz Stapleton [00:36:46]:
And I told him that and he.

Carly Campbell [00:36:49]:
Adjusted his design to stand out from the rest of the pins that were.

Carly Campbell [00:36:52]:
Ranking and his traffic went up.

Liz Stapleton [00:36:54]:
Yeah, I was thinking, was it like Pirates of the Caribbean? They're more like guidelines. They're not hard and fast rules. Maybe you do want to use a face in yours.

Carly Campbell [00:37:06]:
Maybe it's, oh, I do lots.

Liz Stapleton [00:37:07]:
Who knows?

Carly Campbell [00:37:08]:
Think of your niche, think of your.

Liz Stapleton [00:37:10]:
People, and then do like we said, use Pinterest search. See what's showing up. Make your pins look different from that wall, because it does oftentimes become a wall it does.

Liz Stapleton [00:37:21]:
Yeah.

Liz Stapleton [00:37:21]:
And then one last quick question, because I'd love to get your thoughts on.

Carly Campbell [00:37:26]:
Giraffe pens, because I think because they get cut off. So I don't like to use them.

Liz Stapleton [00:37:32]:
Because I feel like long term they're not the best strategy, but I feel like they still work.

Carly Campbell [00:37:36]:
Well, I agree they still work. And here is the thing. Pinterest is really only concerned with Pinterest.

Carly Campbell [00:37:47]:
So Pinterest isn't worried about your bottom.

Carly Campbell [00:37:50]:
Line or what's working to bring you traffic ever. And yes, I think that there is.

Carly Campbell [00:37:56]:
The threat that they will be cut.

Carly Campbell [00:37:58]:
Off in the future and in the future, your Pin, they already are sometimes. But doing everything from a future based.

Carly Campbell [00:38:07]:
I mean, yeah, it's great to insulate.

Carly Campbell [00:38:08]:
Yourself, but doing absolutely everything from a.

Carly Campbell [00:38:10]:
Future based perspective, you know what I mean?

Carly Campbell [00:38:14]:
Shut its doors next year. And everything that we've done on Pinterest, I don't think it's going to, but.

Carly Campbell [00:38:18]:
I mean, it could sometimes you have.

Carly Campbell [00:38:21]:
To do what works now.

Carly Campbell [00:38:23]:
What works now is still long Pins if you really don't want them to get cut off.

Carly Campbell [00:38:28]:
If you're worried that Pinterest is going.

Carly Campbell [00:38:30]:
To suppress them somehow immediately, then keep.

Carly Campbell [00:38:34]:
Them at because Pinterest does cut off sometimes at 1275. So keep your Pins at 1250, do 600 by 1250. Try 700 by.

Liz Stapleton [00:38:47]:
Whatever that ratio is.

Carly Campbell [00:38:49]:
Yeah, I think it's 1700 by 1550.

Carly Campbell [00:38:55]:
But then if you do that, don't.

Carly Campbell [00:38:57]:
Put any text in the bottom order of your Pin.

Carly Campbell [00:39:00]:
Focus your text on the top if you're making draft Pins.

Liz Stapleton [00:39:03]:
Yeah, and you can always split the difference of, like, do, because you can.

Carly Campbell [00:39:06]:
Create multiple Pins for post.

Liz Stapleton [00:39:08]:
Do some long two by three, and then that way, either way, you're covered.

Liz Stapleton [00:39:13]:
Yes.

Carly Campbell [00:39:14]:
Now, what I think is interesting is after my rich Pin debacle that I had, it was interesting to note that the only two Pins that I have ranking currently while I'm working on building.

Carly Campbell [00:39:24]:
My account back up are short Pins.

Carly Campbell [00:39:26]:
And I think that's interesting.

Carly Campbell [00:39:28]:
So maybe in the algorithm brain, maybe Pinterest wants to give more relevance to.

Carly Campbell [00:39:36]:
Short Pins, but the users are still clicking on Giraffe Pins.

Carly Campbell [00:39:42]:
Yeah, okay, make both like you said.

Carly Campbell [00:39:44]:
Make four Pins per post. Just do it right away at the.

Carly Campbell [00:39:48]:
Beginning when you make the Pin post.

Liz Stapleton [00:39:50]:
And some things that will help is your free resource. Tell us about that.

Carly Campbell [00:40:00]:

Carly Campbell [00:40:06]:
As an exclusive, special free thing.

Carly Campbell [00:40:11]:
I've got canva templates for people who just aren't sure if their Pin design is good. Now, I normally don't actually like templates. I don't really use them. And I strongly suggest that as you grow with Pinterest, you learn to make.

Carly Campbell [00:40:26]:
Your own Pins for the post that you're making.

Carly Campbell [00:40:30]:
Because I think that it's best to work with the image.

Carly Campbell [00:40:32]:
I think it's best to create a new Pin. But when we're learning and sometimes when.

Carly Campbell [00:40:37]:
We're in a hurry, let's face it, we don't always have time to make ten new pins all the time, every day. Templates can be a real time saver and a good learning tool for when you're trying to figure out what works.

Carly Campbell [00:40:47]:
So I've got a set of currently.

Carly Campbell [00:40:50]:
It's 25, but I hope that before we go live with this, it'll be 35 Pin templates for Canva.

Carly Campbell [00:40:59]:
I actually think they're pretty good, and.

Carly Campbell [00:41:00]:
I don't normally think templates are very good, so at least check them out. It is 25 short templates as of today, but I'm hoping to add ten Giraffe templates as well because I do.

Carly Campbell [00:41:12]:
Still think that Giraffe templates work and.

Carly Campbell [00:41:15]:
