Liz Stapleton [00:00:00]:
Alright, guys, I'm really excited for this next session with Alison from Inspired Budget. I know next to nothing about Instagram. I feel like a very old millennial. So Alison, thank you so much.

Allison Baggerly [00:00:10]:
Yes, thank you so much for having me. I'm so excited to be here with everyone.

Liz Stapleton [00:00:14]:
Yeah, I mean, you have an incredible Instagram. So can you tell us just kind of an overview of what we're gonna what we're gonna learn today?

Allison Baggerly [00:00:21]:
Awesome. So what we're gonna learn today is I'm gonna give you four strategies that you can implement, hopefully starting today, so that way you can grow your following. And these are strategies that I have implemented myself. They are tested, they are proven. I've even had other people implement them. And they have seen wonderful growth in their following.

Liz Stapleton [00:00:41]:
Yeah, because she has just how many followers do you have?

Allison Baggerly [00:00:46]:
95,000 in 2 and a half years.

Liz Stapleton [00:00:49]:
Yeah. That's huge, guys. More than 95,000. I just like pulled her. She has a gorgeous instagram. Yeah, it's really impressive and inspiring. Okay, so let's go ahead and dig in. I'm going to let you kind of kick it off and I'll questions.

Allison Baggerly [00:01:05]:
Okay. So the first thing that people always ask me is, do I really need to be posting consistently? Like, do I have to post every day? Do I have to be in my stories every day? And the answer is, I think you should be consistently posting. Just like you're going to be consistently creating content for your blog, you need to be consistently posting to your Instagram. So I post every single day and I'm in my stories every single day. And the way I do that is I batch all of my posts. I batch everything. I even sometimes will batch my stories out.

Liz Stapleton [00:01:38]:
Okay, how do you mean you batch out? So obviously I understand batching and creating images right, for Instagram, and you can even their schedulers for that if you want. But batching stories because I don't think.

Allison Baggerly [00:01:51]:
I've ever even done a story.

Liz Stapleton [00:01:54]:
Those tend to be more videos and kind of live. Can you explain how you batch those?

Allison Baggerly [00:01:59]:
Okay, so when it comes to batching my stories, what I actually do is I plan everything out. So I'll brainstorm what I'm going to talk about. Because if you've ever tried to jump into your stories, especially if it's after a long day, if you're still working regular nine to five, then you sometimes get home and you're just like, I don't even know what I want to talk about. You have nothing to talk about, then you put it off and then you start to resent and dislike Instagram. And so what I actually do, and I'll show you is I plan out things I can talk about. So I have a calendar and I literally write down like, my post ideas, my Instagram stories ideas. So I have an idea of something I can always talk about. That way if I want to talk about it. I can. And the way I sometimes batch my stories, I don't do it all the.

Allison Baggerly [00:02:45]:
Time is I will actually do a.

Allison Baggerly [00:02:48]:
Story, change my shirt, do another story, change my shirt, and I just save them. I download them to my phone, and then on that day, I upload them. Okay. There are places where you can pay, like, I know later, if you pay for the platform, that you can schedule your stories out. I personally don't do that because I'm cheap, so I don't want to pay for something. But it's definitely a really great way to say, like, okay, I know I'm going to have a really busy Sunday, but I want to at least show my face a couple of times. Let me record something on Friday or Saturday.

Liz Stapleton [00:03:23]:
Can I ask a super novice question?

Allison Baggerly [00:03:25]:
Sure.

Liz Stapleton [00:03:25]:
Really got to show how little I know about Instagram.

Allison Baggerly [00:03:27]:
No, it's okay.

Liz Stapleton [00:03:28]:
You record your story. So you record them in the Instagram app, and you don't post them and you download them. Is that what you're saying?

Allison Baggerly [00:03:33]:
Yes. So what you do is you pull up just like you're going to record a normal story, and then there's a little arrow button, and you save it. So what I actually do is because I work from home full time, but I like posting my stories in the evenings. So what I actually do is I will record my stories, caption them, download them to my phone, and later on that night, I will actually just upload them super quickly whenever people are more likely to be on the app.

Liz Stapleton [00:04:00]:
Okay.

Allison Baggerly [00:04:01]:
Got you.

Allison Baggerly [00:04:01]:
Yeah. So just a little stories hack, if you will.

Liz Stapleton [00:04:05]:
Yeah.

Allison Baggerly [00:04:06]:
Okay. All right.

Liz Stapleton [00:04:07]:
So you batch your content, or you very least kind of have an editorial calendar for it, which I love the use of editorial calendar because it always gives you something. Even if something comes up that day that's more inspiring that you're going to talk about, you just then have that idea of pushed another day. You don't have to stick hardcore to your editorial calendar for anything blogging.

Allison Baggerly [00:04:27]:
Exactly. And I personally batch my Instagram post seven days in advance, and I brainstorm all the content. Then I take all the pictures and do all the images at once, upload it all at once, caption it all at once. So that's what I've been doing since the beginning because I now work at home full time on my business. But I was a teacher for two years of it. And so I would do that every single Saturday during nap time. And I think that that's something that most people, it throws them off is the time that Instagram can suck out of you. But if you batch it and if you batch and you can still be consistent and it doesn't take as much time as everyone thinks it does.

Allison Baggerly [00:05:11]:
Yeah.

Liz Stapleton [00:05:12]:
So a couple of follow up questions to that a, what tool are you using batch?

Liz Stapleton [00:05:17]:
And then B, how many posts are.

Liz Stapleton [00:05:20]:
You doing per day?

Allison Baggerly [00:05:21]:
Okay, great question. So I use later.com to batch. It was the first one I ever used, and you can schedule 30 posts for free. And I like that now. I do set it to notify me. I don't have the one where it automatically posts because I get a notification for the time I want to do it. I do one last read over for spell check because there's always something you miss, right? I do one more read over, make sure if I have a link in my bio, it's there, and then I hit publish. So I do that, and then what was the other question you asked me?

Liz Stapleton [00:05:52]:
How many times a day you post?

Allison Baggerly [00:05:53]:
Oh, I only post one time a day.

Allison Baggerly [00:05:55]:
Okay.

Allison Baggerly [00:05:55]:
The only time I'll post more than once a day is if I'm going through a big launch and I feel like my feed is too heavy on me talking about something I'm promoting.

Allison Baggerly [00:06:06]:
Okay, got you.

Allison Baggerly [00:06:07]:
Okay. But one time a day is enough. But I'm in my stories every day, and I do anywhere between ten to 15 stories a day. I think stories are honestly becoming more important because people are seeing those probably more than they're seeing the always at.

Liz Stapleton [00:06:21]:
The top of the feed.

Allison Baggerly [00:06:22]:
Yes. And if posting every day is overwhelming to you, then what I say is just start out with three times a.

Allison Baggerly [00:06:29]:
Week and then move it up to.

Allison Baggerly [00:06:30]:
Five times a week. Because I think so many people say I have to post every day. They get overwhelmed, and then they just want to quit Instagram. But the whole purpose is to build that relationship with your followers so that way you can drive them back to your blog, you can drive them back to your products, and you can ultimately, hopefully, get them off of the Instagram app and to where you want them to go.

Liz Stapleton [00:06:51]:
Okay, so you say you do ten to 15 stories a day.

Allison Baggerly [00:06:56]:
What does that look like?

Liz Stapleton [00:06:57]:
How long are they? What like yeah.

Allison Baggerly [00:07:00]:
So every story is 15 seconds. Can't be longer than 15 seconds. A lot of times I'll talk about what my post is that day. Sometimes I'll share, like, okay, so true story. Two days ago, I was just, like, in a weird mood. I just felt really gross. No. Part of me really wanted to get into my stories and interact. It wasn't what I wanted to do. And so I thought, Well, I still want to put something out there. So I linked because I do have swipe up. I linked to three of my blog posts to send them to my blog. I even just showed what I was cooking for dinner, but I didn't show my face. It just showed really quickly what I was cooking for dinner. And then I said, hey, if you're looking for new followers, here are ten people that I love, and I screenshotted I took a screenshot of ten people that I follow inside my niche that I personally enjoy their Instagram. I tagged those people, and it was great because I was offering good information to my followers, and it allowed me to be a little bit hands off that day.

Liz Stapleton [00:08:03]:
Okay. No, I like that.

Liz Stapleton [00:08:04]:
As a good tip.

Liz Stapleton [00:08:07]:
Swipe up. I think that's something that's available once you reach a certain number of followers.

Allison Baggerly [00:08:11]:
Yes. You either have to be verified or have 10,000 followers.

Allison Baggerly [00:08:15]:
Okay, got you.

Liz Stapleton [00:08:17]:
So I feel like we've covered batching. What was your second tip for growing?

Allison Baggerly [00:08:22]:
So my second tip was to solve a problem for them. Like, whenever you're posting, always think about how can you solve a problem for your followers? And that might look like actually solving a problem. That's difficult for them, giving them information. It might look like inspiring them with some sort of quote and inspiration. Or it might even look like just making them smile, because people want to smile whenever they're on Instagram. They want to feel happy. They want to have a laugh. And so solving a problem and really thinking about it in that way whenever you're deciding on a caption, can be really helpful to help. It causes people to say, oh, my goodness, I want to start seeking out posts from this person. I really want to start going to their profile to see if they have anything for me. I want yes, they're helping me because I'm pretty sure most people get the blogging is they want to help. They want to help people solve people's problems. And so your Instagram can be the exact same way.

Liz Stapleton [00:09:23]:
Okay, yeah, no, I think that's a great point, and that's true of your content, right? So maybe it's one tip on your Instagram, and then go to my blog to read more and really get this problem solved.

Allison Baggerly [00:09:34]:
Yes. I personally share two blog posts a week in my Instagram. So out of seven days so it's easy sometimes when you think, okay, oh, my gosh, I have seven days of something to Batch. Well, two of the seven could be sending them back about a post or about something you want them to check out. And I'll sometimes just copy and paste the opening paragraph, and that's my caption, right? Like, if I wrote it once, it's got to be good, and then I have them go to the link in my bio, and so it helps it seem less overwhelming, and you could break.

Liz Stapleton [00:10:10]:
It out so that it's like, okay, two days is a blog post. One day is like, a quote that I like. One day is something I'm watching this week that can tie back to my content in some way. And what I do absolutely kind of have categories that you're like, okay, this is kind of how I feel in that content. Rather than being like, what do I do.

Allison Baggerly [00:10:31]:
Yeah, exactly.

Liz Stapleton [00:10:33]:
Okay.

Liz Stapleton [00:10:35]:
I did want to just quickly ask, so what sort of link in bio do you update your link daily? Are you using, like, a link tree or something along those lines?

Allison Baggerly [00:10:44]:
I do use link tree. It's what I've used from the beginning, and it works. I only update it whenever I let me see if I have an Instagram post that is leading to a blog post. I don't keep all my blog posts on there. If I mention a blog post, I'll keep, like, two or three at a time, because after a while, people don't scroll down and read anything. But I have all of my free opt Ins on there. I mentioned those. That's another thing. If you have some sort of an opt in, that could be an Instagram post that you're talking about. You talk about that in your sorts.

Liz Stapleton [00:11:19]:
Of ideas for Instagram.

Allison Baggerly [00:11:21]:
Good.

Allison Baggerly [00:11:23]:
It makes me happy.

Liz Stapleton [00:11:26]:
Okay, so moving on.

Liz Stapleton [00:11:31]:
So we want to make sure we get to all of them, get questions answered. So what's next on the list?

Allison Baggerly [00:11:36]:
So next on the list is to let them know the real you. And this is where it can be a little bit scary, because what I want to challenge you to do is to actually be vulnerable. So I have a little story that goes along with this. Whenever I first started, I was terrified of even getting in my stories. I really was. The idea of people seeing me stumble over my words was nerve wracking to me. I didn't want to appear. I wanted to appear, like, perfect in these people's eyes, which is silly. And I went outside in my backyard. I told my husband it was the weekend. I said, hey, look, I need to just go jump in my stories real quick. I'm going to talk about X, Y, and Z. I'll be gone ten minutes. I'm going to come back inside. 45 minutes later, he comes out, and he's like, what are you doing? And I was like, I can't get this right. The light's not good. This filter looks terrible. I'm stumbling over my words, and he was like, Stop. And I said, excuse me. And he was like, Stop. Just stop. Just let them know the real you. Like, if you let them know the real Allison, they'll like you, and they'll keep following along. They don't want this fake version of you.

Liz Stapleton [00:12:39]:
And I was like, there's already a lot of that.

Allison Baggerly [00:12:41]:
Yeah. And I was like, oh, my gosh, she's right. And so whenever I was willing to open up and let them see the quirky bubbly side and then also see the vulnerable side, where I have talked about anxiety and depression that I've struggled with, I've talked about marriage, I've talked a little bit about kids. And I tie it all back into overcoming your goals, overcoming your trials, and dealing with your finances. It turns people into I've had people that message me that say, I feel like you're my best friend, because they feel like they really know you if you give them the opportunity. And those are the loyal people that are going to then go read your blog. Those are the loyal people that are going to sign up for your email list. They're going to be the ones that buy the course that you make. They're going to be the ones that watch the videos on the YouTube channel that you'll create one day. So I think that there's just so much people are scared to do it, but I think if you're willing to take the risk, then yeah, you might look silly every now and then, but it's so wonderful whenever you can just show up and be you.

Liz Stapleton [00:13:45]:
Okay. No, I like that, being yourself. And I think those are the like, when you hear like an Instagram story or I say story, but anything like posts, like, go viral or something, it's because someone's being so vulnerable and so open about that. Yes, I did, because you mentioned it in this one. Filters, do you tend to stick with a certain filter every time to kind of give a branded look or what?

Allison Baggerly [00:14:14]:
I don't use filters at all. I don't use filters at all. Some people do. Filters don't bother me as much as they used to. I think whenever I was first starting out, I used the filter that makes your skin look really smooth and everything. And then I was like, I'm lying to my people. My skin isn't always smooth. Why am I doing this? I don't personally use filters. I don't think there's anything against them. I think, though, that when you can show up without a filter that people feel like it's more real.

Allison Baggerly [00:14:45]:
Yeah.

Allison Baggerly [00:14:46]:
Okay.

Liz Stapleton [00:14:48]:
Do you ever do any kind of certain lighting to make sure photos and they're all bright and light and beautiful?

Allison Baggerly [00:14:55]:
Oh, so in my Instagram post yes, I have a set of presets for lightroom. So I do have the lightroom app I use because mine are always, like, very bright. So I want the brights to be bright, but I want the real color to come through. So for my photos inside my feed, I do use certain presets through the lightroom app and ones that I've purchased as well. And so that has made my life so much easier and I wish I had bought those years ago. They were a wonderful investment.

Liz Stapleton [00:15:28]:
Okay, great to know.

Allison Baggerly [00:15:31]:
All right.

Liz Stapleton [00:15:33]:
We talked about batching, we talked about solving a problem. We talked about being yourself and being yourself vulnerable.

Allison Baggerly [00:15:39]:
Yes.

Allison Baggerly [00:15:40]:
Is your fourth tip?

Allison Baggerly [00:15:42]:
My fourth tip is to encourage engagement because ultimately they're on the Internet. Everyone has an opinion. Right. And I know it can be so frustrating when you have this post and you put all this time captioning it, you put all this work into it, and then you're like, no one's commenting. Like, what's going on. You think people are constantly talking on the Internet a lot of times about things that it's like people have that what is it? Whenever it's like, I'm sorry, now I'm losing my train of thought. People will say things on the Internet that they want to say to you in front of your face. Right. And so then you go on Instagram and you create this post, and you're waiting for someone to say something, and no one's saying anything. So you're like, what is going on? So my way of encouraging engagement is to always ask a question at the end of the post, because sometimes people need to be told, I want to hear from you. So if you tell a short story or you have a post and then you have a question, you can even say, let me know your answer in the comments. Like, I'll actually write that. Raise your hand in the comments if you can relate. Because people need to be told to engage. Another way that you can engage with your followers that will work tremendously, and you do not need swipe up to do it is when you're in your stories, you actually tell them, hey, you're talking about something, and you say, hey, I want your opinion. I want to know how you feel about blank. Send me a DM. The button's right down here. Send me a DM right now and let me know how you feel about blank. And what's happening is that person immediately sends you a DM. They're in your inbox. You can engage with them. You have built that relationship with them. If they have a question, you can send them a link back to your blog post where you answer something. And so you're still getting that same type of engagement. And it's honestly deeper because I truly believe that DMs are gold. Like, they are gold mine. Okay.

Liz Stapleton [00:17:38]:
Yeah. So it brings me to some additional questions.

Allison Baggerly [00:17:43]:
Okay, sure, no problem.

Liz Stapleton [00:17:44]:
Because DMs, I feel like, well, A, you're limited in how many DMs you can get is my understanding. But also, how do you manage that?

Allison Baggerly [00:17:52]:
Wait, what do you mean you're limited?

Liz Stapleton [00:17:54]:
And again, I could be 100% wrong because my knowledge of Instagram is like, whatever, but I think you're limited to something like 200 DMs a day, which yeah, is a lot. And that's different. Right. So how often are you checking your DMs? How often are you that do that? How do you manage your inbox?

Allison Baggerly [00:18:15]:
I guess I think it depends on how many followers you have and how often you encourage engagement. So my point right now is it's a lot of work. Like, I'm not going to lie. When you have thousands upon thousands of followers and you're also encouraging engagement, you get a lot of messages. I just posted a story right now about my dog losing his leg, and I know I'm going to get lots of people's opinions and lots of people's messages. So I'm going to make sure that after I post that, that I have time to actually respond. And I even have an app. You can download an app for Mac where it goes up on your desktop so I can type and respond faster.

Allison Baggerly [00:18:54]:
What app is that?

Allison Baggerly [00:18:55]:
Oh, I think it's just called, like, instagram message. It's like $5, but I downloaded it and I can sit there and actually type back and respond. It's hard. I try to take 30 minutes at a time and then move on and come back to it because there are times whenever I can't possibly get to every single message, but I try my hardest. I can't possibly get to every single comment, but I try my hardest. And so it gets harder as your audience grows. But I see it as like an honor that someone's willing to reach out and take time out of their day.

Liz Stapleton [00:19:33]:
Yeah, to message problem, for sure.

Allison Baggerly [00:19:36]:
Exactly. And so a lot of times people will message me with these super complicated questions that they're stories, and I just can't get back to them and spend all my time writing a super long response. So I'll try to send them to a blog post. So it takes commitment. I would say have some sort of a schedule set out where, okay, three nights a week for 30 minutes, I'm going to work on direct messages.

Allison Baggerly [00:20:01]:
Okay.

Liz Stapleton [00:20:02]:
And then I also wanted to ask, how long are your captions typically?

Allison Baggerly [00:20:08]:
So on my stories, stories and posts. Okay. So in my stories, I always paraphrase what I'm saying in my stories, and that takes time. There are apps where it can auto caption what you say. I personally don't like those. I did purchase one, I tried it, I didn't like it. So I personally caption my stories. It takes time. However, there are so many people that are watching their stories with their phone on silence because they're laying in bed next to a kid. They're at work and procrastinating, and there's all these people. And so I do that. In terms of my Instagram posts, I try to keep them a little bit longer. I try to have some sort of a story in there, some sort of a connection, but not all the time, but those connections, whenever you're able to really offer some sort solve a problem or make some sort of connection, it's going to be better in the long run. And when you're showing your real self and you're being vulnerable, it's not limited to just your stories. Like you can do that in your Instagram post as well.

Allison Baggerly [00:21:11]:
Yeah. Okay.

Liz Stapleton [00:21:12]:
And then kind of the other question I wanted to ask, because I feel like it's where a lot of people get hung up and it's always hashtag.

Allison Baggerly [00:21:20]:
Hashtags? Yes. Okay. So hashtags can be amazing if you can land on an Explore page. So that's the ultimate goal is you want people to find you that are not following you through hashtags. So just as like, whoever's watching this, open up your phone, go to your Explore page and type in a hashtag, right? So for instance, my niche let me do this too. If I open up Instagram and I type in, I click on tags and I just type in Budget because I talk about personal finances. Budget, it has 1.4 million posts at the time we are recording this. Okay. My chances for showing up in the Explore page for Budget, not likely, right? Because there's so many people using that hashtag. But if I type in, let's see, just Budgeting. Budgeting hashtag budgeting only has 487,000 posts. So you see, you want hashtags. You want to search for hashtags that aren't going to have millions, but are only going to have in the hundred thousand or even lower because it's going to give you a higher possibility of showing up in the Explore page for people.

Liz Stapleton [00:22:37]:
Okay, good to know.

Allison Baggerly [00:22:39]:
And so I like to look at some that are like anywhere under 500,000, maybe even like 100,000, 200,000. Another thing I recommend doing is go to someone that you admire that's in your same niche, look at their posts and see what their hashtags are. And you always want your hashtags to be relevant to what you're posting about. So I wouldn't post a picture of my kids and then write hashtag dogs, hashtag, budgeting, hashtag dogs of Instagram. I wouldn't do that. You want it to be related. So for instance, because I talk about budgeting, I use a lot of times I use the hashtag, hashtag cash envelopes. But if my picture is not about cash envelopes, and I'm not talking about cash envelopes, I will not use that.

Allison Baggerly [00:23:24]:
Okay, got you.

Liz Stapleton [00:23:26]:
And how many hashtags do you typically do then? Do you max it out?

Allison Baggerly [00:23:31]:
I don't usually max it out, but as many as you can think of for that post that are relevant to that post.

Allison Baggerly [00:23:37]:
Okay.

Liz Stapleton [00:23:38]:
And when you're batching right, I assume you're coming up with your hashtag spin as well.

Allison Baggerly [00:23:44]:
Yes.

Liz Stapleton [00:23:45]:
Do you have kind of like a running list of ones that you'll go.

Allison Baggerly [00:23:47]:
Look at or what? So I have some that I use over and over and over again. I highly recommend. Okay. At one point, I copied them into a Google doc and I would just copy and paste. But the Instagram will mark that as spammy. If you're using the same hashtags just in a row, one after another, that's going to come off as spammy. So you don't want to do that. So I always do hashtag inspired budget, which is my business. And then I do some of the same ones because they are more broad. But then I really try to think, okay, what can I narrow down to? You can even start searching hashtags. If you're batching your content, then it's not that hard to search for hashtags because that's just part of your step.

Liz Stapleton [00:24:28]:
Yeah. Okay, got you.

Liz Stapleton [00:24:30]:
No, I think that's a great point. So I think we've covered your four tips. I feel like we've covered a lot of just the release because I don't know anything, any additional kind of tips or things in terms of setting up your Bio business account versus personal account, like anything like that, that people should maybe be aware of when they're trying to get going and get more followers following your tips.

Allison Baggerly [00:24:54]:
So I personally, and I don't know if there's any science or studies or anything like this, I personally like it whenever people's profile picture is their face because it allows me to directly connect with that person and I know what they look like. I prefer that over a logo. I did have a logo at a time, but I felt like when I'm scrolling through, if I see someone's face, I don't know, I'm just more likely to click on it. Also be in your pictures sometimes because people like to see who you are. They like to make that personal connection. Pictures of people's faces in them do so much better than just like stock photos. And you can make your pictures look really nice if you download some of those. If you start using the Lightroom app on your phone, I mean, you can make it look so great. In terms of your Bio, make sure you have a link in your Bio. Make sure you have your email set up in your Bio so that way that people can click on their email and email you. Because as you grow, you might even get opportunities from brands. So that way you can be a brand ambassador and get actually paid to do some work as long as it follows in with your niche and you.

Don'T ever want to sell out because then you're going to lose those loyal people.

Allison Baggerly [00:26:09]:
Exactly.

Liz Stapleton [00:26:10]:
Really solid fit exactly for you and will be helpful to your people.

Allison Baggerly [00:26:16]:
Yes.

Allison Baggerly [00:26:17]:
Okay.

Liz Stapleton [00:26:18]:
Any final words before we tell them about sort of often freebie you have for them?

Allison Baggerly [00:26:24]:
No. Feel free to follow me on Instagram and send me a DM if you have a question or if you need support in any way.

Allison Baggerly [00:26:34]:
Okay.

Liz Stapleton [00:26:35]:
And then your Freebie is all about learning to grow your Instagram following and you're sharing how you grew Instagram from zero to 40,000 in a year.

Allison Baggerly [00:26:42]:
Wow.

Liz Stapleton [00:26:43]:
Do you want to tell them any more about that? Obviously the link is going to be below, but additional information they should know.

Allison Baggerly [00:26:50]:
Yes. So basically every single month I'm going to send you a whole calendar with an idea for what you can post for every single day of the month. So basically before the month begins, you'll get a calendar and it'll just be filled up with post ideas and so you can take what you like and leave the rest. It's a really good way for you to kind of have someone. Else just hand over some ideas for you, and then every single week, I send helpful information, other tips and tricks, things that I've learned along the way just to help you grow your Instagram following.

Liz Stapleton [00:27:23]:
Okay, well, I'm going to go sign up for that right now.

Allison Baggerly [00:27:25]:
Yeah, that'd be great.

Liz Stapleton [00:27:27]:
Like I said, I know nothing, and I've already learned so much to thank you so much. I really appreciate all your help. I hope everyone got a lot out of this session.

Allison Baggerly [00:27:34]:
Well, thank you.

Liz Stapleton [00:27:36]:
They may be novices like me, or they're laughing at me. Either way, so much. I think this is really great information. You guys should definitely follow her on Instagram, and we'll catch you on the next session. Thank you so much.

Allison Baggerly [00:27:48]:
Okay. Thank you so much for having me. Bye.
