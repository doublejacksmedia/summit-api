Hello, hello. Hi. I am so glad that you decided to sign up for the Blogger Breakthrough Summit. I'm Sandra van der Lee. Nice to meet you. Nice to see you. If you haven't seen me before, this session is all about five emails you can send to sell more your digital products. If you haven't met me yet, I talk fast. I like being short, simple, to the point and effective. So I'm not going to do a whole lot of fluff. The goal is very simple. We want to sell more products with email. So before we do all that, you're going to meet the hostess with the mostest. That's me over here. I'm going to tell you about the five emails you need to send. And we're going to talk about the one mistake that you really need to avoid that I see happen again and again. And then I'm just going to give you the next step of, Hey, now you have this information, what can you actually go ahead and do with that? So if you don't know me yet, I was never properly employed in a 9:00 to 5:00 by [inaudible 00:01:13] , all of that jazz. I went straight from a two years Master of Science degree.

[00:01:17.780] - Sandra van der Lee
So theoretically, I'm a researcher and I have an engineering title to being self-employed. This used to say I'm a rehabilitating digital nomad, but actually, I am rehabilitated Because this is the first time I am recording in my brand new apartment where my name is on the lease. We're on the hook. I moved to a brand new place, which I'll tell you very, very shortly about, just so you have some idea about who I am. But it's been about seven years. When I got started in the online business, I had no network, I had no experience, and I really didn't have a clue. And things were tough until about three years I think at this point, that should even say four years ago, maybe five. But things were tough, right? If you don't have a network, if you don't have the experience, if you don't really know what you're doing, it is really rough. And at some point, I still intensely remember the moment where I was sitting behind my desk and I literally sat there and I said to myself, Hey, if I don't make this amount of money by the end of the year, I'm going to have to get a job.

[00:02:27.160] - Sandra van der Lee
It was like, This is going to happen. You're going to make that $5,000 a month mark, or you're going to find a job, which was basically what I needed to pay myself as average as salary. I knew that that's what my business needed to make. At that point, I decided that most advice was bullshit, and the only thing that really mattered was sales, selling, sales. Funny story, I hit my first five figure month, six weeks later. So that is the power of a decision for you. So back in 2022, I 3.5X my revenue to 150K. Still completely solo, like 99% of the time, it's just me. I occasionally have a virtual system that will work 10 hours a month for me. I've hired, I've outsourced, but usually it's like this business is 100% me. Then in 2023, things took a turn for the crazy. I invested $100,000. I don't even want to talk about how much money that is, into my second business so I could get an investor visa and move to the United States. 2024 was the year of a sabbatical waiting on visa approval, meeting the guy I now live with, way back in February of 2024, and romance, and life just lifeing all over the place, and finally moving across the ocean to an entire different continent, trying to rebuild a whole new life, basically.

[00:03:55.720] - Sandra van der Lee
So that's the last couple of years. If I should have probably about my experience. If you don't know, the other company I'm known for is Damn Copy. I've written hundreds of sales pages, hundreds to thousands. I haven't counted of sales emails. I make six figures a year just from writing and sending my own emails, I wrote the copy behind some really big launches and successful products. I know what's up, basically. If you overspend with certain business owners that you like and whose face might on this summit, it might have been my fault. I do not feel bad because my clients will create really great stuff. So let's dig in. Before we begin, I hate that this needs to be said, but all of this is copyrighted material. You have a single-use license to watch this. Use the information for your business. Please do not turn around and replicate, create derivative products, teach this material as your own, or any of that sketchy stuff, right? Not allowed. Don't do it. Now, what if sending emails was equal to making sales? To do that, there are five basic emails and principles that you will want to hit.

[00:05:09.640] - Sandra van der Lee
So the five emails, and I'm going to tell you more about all of these individual emails, but the five emails are the, Yeah, That full on energy. I can tell I'm waving outside of the screen. I'll try to keep my entertainment or my excitement contained. So we have the excitement, the yes, the hell yes email. We need to talk about the who even cares email. We're going to talk about the FAQ email. We're going to talk about social proof, which again is super important. And then finally, the decide, damn it email. Those are all the five emails you will need to sell more of your products, more of your courses, more of anything, really. The yay email, the very first email, this email is all about sharing your excitement. It's all about introducing the offer, the product, the sale, the discount, the buy one, get one, whatever it is you're promoting. This is about introducing it and about sharing your excitement about it. And if this is tough for you, if you cannot come up with excitement for the offer you're making, you might be making the wrong offer. You might need some other tweaks.

[00:06:15.950] - Sandra van der Lee
But this is really about, this is great. I have something for you. The energy or the vibe for woo attendees, the approach you want in this email is This is such a great freaking thing for you. If you get this email, you're lucky because here's what I got. This email is excited. Exciting for the people that need this product, which if you've built an email list around the subject that you do, should be every single person on there. That's email number one. Then email number two. This one is all about who even cares. I want you to share the benefit of what you do. Whereas email number one is like, Hey, here's this great deal. Here's the product. Here's what's included. I'm super excited. Go check it out. This one's really about, Why does this matter? Why does this product actually matter? Let's get really, really real about that. Because very often, what I notice is a lot of people we say surface level, right? But it's like, Why does your work matter? Why does this product matter? And this can be frivolous. I buy things for pleasure. I buy things for fun. I recently took up, so I moved to the United States, I took up a pottery class.

[00:07:41.680] - Sandra van der Lee
It is frivolous. It is indulgent. It is silly. We make stuff with clay, and it's pricey. Let's be honest about that. It's pricey. It's an expensive hobby, right? But it's great, and I love it, and it helps me relax, and it's a break from everything, and it makes sure that I'm not on my phone, and I'm creating something with my hands, and I'm filling up my house and all of my friends' houses with things that I made with my hands and painted, and put attention and intention into, right? That's why it matters. It's not like, Oh, yeah, you'll have a mug that you make yourself. Yeah, that's cool. That's what the thing is. But that's not why the thing is important. So I want you to dig deep on that one. Why does this thing matter? Then email three, the what the FAQ email. It's to answer any questions. Now, very, very frequently, this is a great place to address objections. So if people are like, I think I'm too advanced for this. I don't have this bit of knowledge. Is this still for me? I don't know if I'll be able to make the meeting.

[00:08:46.770] - Sandra van der Lee
That's a big thing for me. If there's a live component, I want to know when it is. You can very easily pull this from your sales pages. But if any questions have come in for email one or email two, or maybe you're doing a social campaign, maybe there's people that ask the same thing again and again. Is this a downloadable PDF? Is it a workbook? Are there videos? Are there trends? If you get that question more than once, that is a great question to preemptively answer. Because I don't have official statistics for us, but I feel like if one person asks you something, that means that there's at least nine other people with the same question who don't go through the effort or that don't want to be a burden, they don't ask. Now, this is a great because it's really easy to pull from your sales page. If you have a sales page with an FAQ or a checkout page where you answer some questions, you can literally send an email that's like, Hey, there's a couple of questions I've received about this product, with the product link. So I gathered them up and I'm answering them all for you.

[00:09:46.760] - Sandra van der Lee
Question one, answer one. Question two, answer two. Call the action to buy the product. Done. This is the easiest, one of the easiest. I think the last one that we're talking about is even easier. But that's really all there is to it. Then social proof. The social proof email is all about you bringing the receipts. You're showing what is possible. Now, I do want you to keep in mind that, especially if you're operating worldwide, if you have clients in the US, you're in Europe, wherever, there are regulations. You cannot be using fake testimonials. The FTC is cracking down. There's those sorts of hoopla, which, again, if you're an ethical business owner, if you use real testimonials, if you screenshot real stuff that people get. If you're honest about what you're doing, this isn't a problem for you. And don't pin me down. That's not legal advice. I know nothing. I'm a potato, not a lawyer. But social proof is all about showing what is possible, showing what other people have done with the program, showing other people's experience with you. At the end of the day, us humans, we're social creatures. We want to stick to the herd because that's safe.

[00:10:57.200] - Sandra van der Lee
So the fact that it was good and effective and other people got value from it makes your leads, make your email list, makes your people that are interested, your potential buyers. It makes them feel safe and that they can do it, too. So that's what's testimonials, screenshots, reviews, what that thing is all about. Then we've already gotten to the final email, and this is the decide, damn it, email. Now, this This is all about making a decision, about giving them a deadline. I know, especially if you work B2B, so if you work business to business, a lot of entrepreneurs are a little bit neuro-spicy. Whether they are on the autism spectrum, they might have ADHD, whatever it is, any of that, a lot of them have a certain time-blindness about them, or they need a deadline to help them make a decision. If there's no deadline, we're going to postpone making the decision. So the easiest way to do or to use that, that urgency that, Hey, it's fine whether you can buy it or not, but I need you to make a choice. Here's the deadline for it. So this is another really simple email.

[00:12:16.280] - Sandra van der Lee
It's literally, Hey, this offer for this is going away. The price is going up. The deal is ending. Buy one, get one is stopping. Free shipping is over. Whatever that is, there's so many hours left for this. Here's a big ass countdown Here's the link. Decide, damn it. That's your last email. Wow, I feel like I talked really fast through that, which is great for you because then you have more time to watch more of these fantastic presentations. So your next steps, based on this, is to come up with a product that you want to promote over email. I want you to figure out some urgency for it. It needs a deadline. Maybe there's a discount. Maybe there's a limited time bonus. Maybe there's a limited number bonus. Only the first 5 people, the first 10 people, not the first 20 people. Maybe the doors are closing. You're going to make it. It's not available anymore. You buy it now or you can wait until it becomes available again. Maybe the price is going up. But I want you to come up with a product that you want to make more sales off, do something special for it.

[00:13:24.890] - Sandra van der Lee
And then I want you to go ahead and write these emails that I just talked to you about and send them out over three to four days. So the easiest thing to do is if you do three or four days, you have one email each day, two on the last day, or you have, if you want to do it in three days, you do two on the first day, one on the middle day, two on the last day. More is fine. Less is not so fine. I just want to put that out there, but more is fine. Now, for bonus points, what you can then do is you take the emails that you've written and you repurpose these for social media. If you read my emails or you see my Instagram posts, I occasionally do that where I'm like, Oh, that's a great email. I'll pull the email, I'll post it to Instagram, I'll call it a day. Finally, sell more products. That's what you need to be doing. I think that this really will help you. So before we wrap up, because I have an awesome gift to help you out, too, I want to make sure that you do not make this mistake.

[00:14:29.480] - Sandra van der Lee
And that is that you let people that unsubscribe stop you. If you send more emails, you will get more unsubscribes. That doesn't mean anything is wrong. If you send more emails and you sell in them, and I see this more of business to consumer than with business to business clients, you might even deal with a hater or two. People might come back and be like, I never signed up for this. And it's like, spoiler alert. Yes, you did. Otherwise you wouldn't get the email. Or it's, Wow, it's so selfish of you to sell, and you shouldn't be selling, and da, da, da, da, da. If you feel bad about selling when the world is chaotic, I have a podcast episode. I have a podcast episode titled Should You Sell When the World is on Fire? And it's episode 11. So if you go to sandravanderlee.com/podcast/11, you will land on it. If you have ever felt uncomfortable about someone selling when in your opinion it was a rude or a bad time to do so, or if you're the person that is selling while everyone else, you shouldn't be selling, we're preoccupied with this thing that's happening worldwide or locally, please go and listen to this.

[00:15:44.410] - Sandra van der Lee
It's going to help you change your mind. It's going to help you do it any way. It's going to help you do what needs to get done. It's honestly, it's my most downloaded podcast episode ever. So, yeah, go find that episode 11 on becoming unapologetic. The podcast, sandravanderlee.com/podcast/11 If someone shows up and tries to shame you for selling over email, even though they signed up, do not, under any circumstance, let that stop you. That's the one thing I want you to take away. For benchmark reference, a very normal unsubscribed rate per email that you send is 0.25%. So that means that if you email 400 people, you will get one unsubscribed. That is completely fine. If you're going to do much, much higher than... If you have a small list, okay, first of all, if you have a small list, don't worry, because the math on that is different. Because if you have 100 people and one person unsubscribes, now your unsubscribed rate is one I forgot how many people I said there. So if it's small, do not worry as much, right? Because even one unsubscribed can be like, oh, big percentage. If you have a big list, if you have whatever, if you have more than a thousand people, like 0.25 % is normal.

[00:17:02.310] - Sandra van der Lee
And for sales emails, that might go a little bit higher. During Black Friday, that might go higher. If we're overwhelmed and busy, that might be a little bit higher. But if you're somewhere around that number, do not worry about the unsubscribed. That is the very, very big one I want you to take away. Now, what about your actual newsletters? Because we've talked about sales email campaigns. Well, we've just discussed that's a campaign. But what about your normal newsletter? Maybe you send a weekly newsletter or a daily or any option in between. If you send a newsletter less than weekly, we got to talk because that's not enough. But you need... Yeah. Let's assume you're sending out that weekly newsletter. What about it? Well, if you need help for how do I write a newsletter that also sells for me, I have a really cool freebie for you that I very aptly named salesy Newsletters or the Salesy Newsletters Toolkit. Inside it, you will find five Salesy newsletter prompts. That doesn't seem like a lot, but first of all, one, they're created by a human. That's very good at this by me. This is not a list of 99 ChatGPT prompts that a robot came up with based on all the media for shit it's read on the internet.

[00:18:11.840] - Sandra van der Lee
These are super strategic. They were And I went through them. I was like, I can probably come up with a year's worth of email just based on these five prompts. I have 25 subject lines for you. So that's five subject line per prompt that you can mix and match with. Again, they're tested, they're There's different things to play around with. You can just fill in the blanks and use them. I have 18 different calls to action based on how you sell. So maybe it's like you need someone to reply with something. Maybe you just wanted to go to a page. Maybe they need to book a call or fill out an application. There's 18 different calls to action for you to play around with, to mix and match. And then I have the six very simple steps to write a newsletter that will sell any type of offer that you have. So this is not just for digital products or courses. If you do services, if you do coaching, if you do consulting, this is for you and it will help you. It basically has the anatomy or the framework you need to write a newsletter that will sell your stuff.

[00:19:12.060] - Sandra van der Lee
So you can go ahead and grab that for free on sandravanderlee.com/salesy-newsletters That link will also be somewhere below to the site next to my presentation. And I highly recommend that you grab that. Now, that was it for me. I am going to be around in the community. So if you have any questions, just feel free to tag me. Let me know. I really, really hope that you're going to send more emails and sell more of your products. Thanks so much for listening and enjoy the rest of the summit.
