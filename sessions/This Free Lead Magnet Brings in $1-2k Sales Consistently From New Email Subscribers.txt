Jamie Bright [00:00:11]:
Back in July, I created a brand new lead magnet that consistently has been bringing in 1 to $2,000 sales from brand new email subscribers, and it's completely automated. It's only email. There's no DMs, no hard selling, no Facebook lives, no nothing other than just email. It's absolutely beautiful, and that's what I'm gonna be telling you about today. For a few years prior to that, I had been focused mostly on building my mastermind and doing high ticket 1 on 1 sales. I got to a point last summer where I realized that I really missed having something that was very scalable that could bring an impact to the people who went through it as well as bring me income without me having to show up 1 on 1, without me having to do any sales calls, without having to do any DMs or slimy marketing tactics or anything. I had had that back in my blogging days and I really missed having that scalable aspect in my business. So I started to consider what kind of product I wanted to have and what was the best way to sell that on autopilot today.

Jamie Bright [00:01:25]:
Because if I've learned anything in the last few years, it's that buyer behavior has changed immensely. In fact, in the last year or 2, a lot of people have seen the results decline pretty significantly because they haven't adjusted the way that they do business to fit this new buyer behavior. But I decided to go with email because that's the one thing that really hasn't changed since I started blogging full time way back in 2011. It literally still works just as well today as it did back then. Whereas things like social media continue to decline in reach unless it's pay to play and even if you are paying to play which is a great way to scale up when you have something that works, it's becoming more and more expensive. And so it's hard to do that profitably. They're only going to continue to increase while organic reach is only going to continue to decline. And even SEO, which I originally built my blog on and was the main source of my traffic is going to be experiencing several upsets over the next few years because of how AI has been changing search in so many ways.

Jamie Bright [00:02:31]:
Maybe you've already seen this on your blog, but email still works essentially the same way. For the most part, it's still reaching far more people than social media. People are still reading their emails and most important, people are still buying via email. It's a phenomenal way to build trust, authority, and desire for your product. And so that's why I picked email to sell this new scalable offer that I was creating and I've been running it for several months now and it works. So in this summit presentation, I'm gonna take you behind the scenes and I'm gonna show you exactly what I did to create this new lead magnet that's different from what most people do and how I based it on this new buyer behavior that I've been seeing in the market. I'm literally gonna walk you through each of the 3 big principles that I used to design this and I'm gonna show you how I translated that into a lead magnet that sells so that you can create one for your own business as well. Because if you are growing your email list consistently, then your sales are going to be growing consistently.

Jamie Bright [00:03:37]:
And if you wanna have a stable business that truly gives you safety and not just stress, then having consistent and predictable income is one of the best ways to do that and I really really want that for you and frankly for me. That's why I created this thing. And then finally at the end, I'm gonna share how you can get a free copy of the one email that I send to every new subscriber that virtually guarantees that I'm going to get in the inbox. This is really powerful. It's super easy to set up and send and you can start getting results from it right away. So you're really gonna wanna listen to the end to make sure that you can get that. Now, if you haven't met me online before, my name is Jamie Bright. I'm the founder of the Bright Entrepreneur Podcast and the ever selling email system.

Jamie Bright [00:04:26]:
I started my online entrepreneurial career way back in 2011 with a blog for photographers, where I taught them how to find clients for their photography businesses. That business quickly grew and over the years I developed an email list of a 119,000 email subscribers, but you don't need a 119,000 email subscribers to make this kind of lead magnet work. In fact, at the time of launching it I only had 720 people on my list at all, so not even a 1000 people because I had spent a few years really focusing on more high ticket, high touch things and leveraging my relationships instead of growing an email list. So last summer, when I decided that I wanted to have a scalable asset in my business again, I started growing my list in earnest. And within two and a half months of launching this new lead magnet, I had more than doubled my email list. I started getting invitations to speak at summits because what I was doing was so different. I started getting consistent sales, which let's just face it, that's amazing. And I had somebody actually approach me about partnering with them in their business and setting up the automation in the back end, and it's just opened up the door for lots of different collaborations, opportunities, and income that I simply didn't have before I created this lead magnet.

Jamie Bright [00:05:49]:
Now I know it sounds like I'm really hyping it up, but that's truly what happened. And it's because I was doing it different from what everyone else is doing, so even if you don't get all the extra stuff in your industry because you're not working with other online business owners like I am, it's still very effective. In fact, if I had never launched that lead magnet, I wouldn't be here in this summit sharing with you about it right now. So not only can this lead magnet bring you consistent income, but it may open up opportunities that you never knew existed that we just can't predict until it happens. Since making my pivot last summer I am on a mission to help online entrepreneurs create consistent and predictable monthly revenue through my mastermind and my courses and my 1 on 1 coaching so that their business can be a source of stability and not stress. So that any launches they do or specific promotions are just extra income on top of what they already have and not necessary income to make ends meet each month. Okay. So here's what I know to be true about buyer behavior that most people take for granted.

Jamie Bright [00:06:54]:
The best time to sell to somebody is when they're actively looking for a solution to one of their problems. And this is why your lead magnet is so powerful for bringing in consistent sales. Because when somebody opts into your lead magnet, they are taking an action that says, in this moment I wanna get the solution and the transformation that this lead magnet promises that I can get. And most people take for granted how powerful it is to know that in this moment, this person is interested. They want a solution. And if we have a product that is aligned with the same topic of our lead magnet, then it makes sense that that person is gonna be interested in purchasing it. Do you see how powerful that moment is? Because here's the thing, it doesn't matter how good your offer is or your product is, if it's not relevant to that person in that moment, they're never gonna buy it. I'm not gonna be out buying diapers for my children anymore because they are all old enough to where they no longer need them.

Jamie Bright [00:07:57]:
And thank goodness because I have 6 kids and we went through a lot of diapers. I don't care how soft, how cheap, how wonderful the diapers are, it's just not relevant to me anymore. I'm not looking to fill that need in my life anymore. If you are selling something to someone who's not interested, it doesn't matter how good your offer is or your sales copy is or any of it if it's not the right time for them and it's not relevant for them. So that's part of why I like to sell through a lead magnet because the moment they opt in they are saying, hi, I'm here, I'm interested, and I want the transformation or the solution that you have in this lead magnet. And so if you can give them a lead magnet that builds trust, that shows them how it can help them specifically and makes it super easy for them to buy right then, they're more likely to do it. Plus, you've already got their attention, and that's, like, half the battle on social media. Right? It's like everybody is screaming for attention.

Jamie Bright [00:09:01]:
Everyone's scrolling through the reels and the shorts and all of these things where you can barely capture someone's attention for even a few seconds. And so if you've captured their attention enough for them to actually opt in for your lead magnet, that's powerful. You not only have their attention but now you know they want what you offer. So why wouldn't you use this as a way to sell to them? And maybe you're sitting there saying, hey, I actually do sell to my new subscribers. I've got, you know, the lead magnet that they can download and then I've got a welcome sequence and it sells in there. I build some trust and I have tell them my authority and I share a few success stories, but it's still not selling. Like, why is it not selling? I'll explain why in just a moment. That's what I see most people doing who really care about their people is they deliver value.

Jamie Bright [00:09:50]:
They go through a 3 to 5 part welcome sequence that warms them up and shares what it is and why it's awesome and all the things and then invites them to buy. But it's really not working that well for most people. They might occasionally get a sale here or there, but not really very often. Then there's other people on the other side of the spectrum where they know that the moment someone opts in, they're interested and so they immediately start selling with them email after email after email, sending a couple emails a day, trying to get you on the phone, trying to get you to buy their thing and it's super pushy, super manipulative and maybe those work but I don't know about you but that just is not my style. I am not here to coerce or force or convince anyone to buy my product or offer if it is not a good fit for them. I want to empower them to self identify that, oh my goodness, this is perfect for me. I definitely want this and then make it super easy for them to buy without any of this pushy, salesy, slimy sales techniques. I wanna build trust with my audience and show them that I actually care about them and their results and making sure that this really is going to be a good fit for them.

Jamie Bright [00:11:07]:
Because let's be honest, we've all probably had people buy our things that weren't a good fit. Maybe it was because we were really persuasive. Maybe it's just because they thought it would be a good fit and then it turned out that it wasn't. Whatever the reason is, when you have people in your programs or who buy your offers who aren't a good fit, they don't get results and they generally tend to be unhappy and then they either complain or ask for a refund or cause any number of headaches. And I've seen it all. I've been in this industry long enough. I've heard the horror stories. I've had a few myself.

Jamie Bright [00:11:38]:
There's no limit to what somebody could do. So I try and avoid bringing people into my programs if I genuinely do not believe it's a good fit for them. And so I try and design all of my sales messaging to not just help build desire for my offer for the right people, but also give people clear indicators of when they shouldn't buy. And I know every sales copywriter out there is probably saying, don't do this, but I think that it's really important to design our lead magnets and our sales copy to make sure that it's authentic and that we're really helping a person. And that's the difference between helping them make an empowered decision and coercing is that we really help them know for real if this is a good fit for them. And if it is, we empower them to buy in the easiest way possible. And if it's not, we say, don't buy, and that's okay. So the goal of the lead magnet is to make it as easy as possible for someone to buy.

Jamie Bright [00:12:34]:
So here are some of the ways that I designed it different from what most people do and from what I see most people teaching. So number 1, I keep everything email only. Most people send their first email, and in that email is like, hey, thanks for signing up for this thing. Here's a link to go download it. They click the link, they get the thing, and they ignore all the other emails. If you look at your stats and your open rates, email 1 will have a really high open rate and click through rate. Emails 2, 3, 4, 5, and such, see a huge drop off in numbers. So when you keep things in email and actually deliver the value in the information right within an email, then it encourages them to continue reading the email and it doesn't require them to download something or log into another site, and it reduces a significant amount of friction.

Jamie Bright [00:13:22]:
Anytime we can reduce friction and make it easier for them to do something or take less actions in order to get what they really want, they're gonna stick around and continue giving us our attention longer because each friction point is a drop off point in attention. So I wanted to make it as easy as possible and keep it all within email. If they're signing up to read email, then I wanna deliver it in email. Now obviously, you can't do this if you are giving away something like Canva templates that require them to go into a different piece of software, but they're already gonna be expecting that so that's not as big of a deal. But that kind of lead magnet isn't the type of lead magnet that quickly builds trust and brings in sales. It might help them quickly get a result, but that's not necessarily gonna build desire to continue working with you and get more value from you. I can't tell you how many free Canva templates and copywriting templates and things that I have downloaded and used and never went back to buy more because it did everything I needed. It's a great way to serve people, but it's not necessarily the best lead magnet if you are looking for income and impact.

Jamie Bright [00:14:25]:
Instead of just doing a single email with a download or something, I did an email based course that has 10 parts, and they are told right at the beginning that it's a 10 part email course. It's totally free, so they're expecting this to be 10 emails long. You don't have to do 10, you can do 3 to 5 if you want to, but because the topic that I was covering was a little bit longer and more in-depth, I did 10. It's what it needed to be. When it's a multiple part email course, it creates engagement, which helps you get in the inbox better, and most importantly it builds a habit of reading emails. So when they get your emails, if they've already opened several of them, they're gonna be more likely to continue opening them in the future because they've already got value or they wouldn't have opened them in the first place. But it's not enough to just make everything come via email, and this is why a lot of people who have well intentioned welcome sequences find that they don't actually convert. And this comes down to the second thing that has changed about buyer behavior.

Jamie Bright [00:15:25]:
They no longer are willing to wait to get the answers they want. There's so many people in the market these days. It's super saturated, and so they're just gonna go find it from someone else. So if you give them the first email in your series but they have to wait for the next ones to come, you've lost their attention. You're literally not doing anything to keep their attention. If they found you online, they opted in, they've read that first email and they're still excited about what they're reading and they want more, it would be foolish for us not to give it to them. So I've actually designed my email course to be bingeable because here's the thing, people who really need what you have to offer and are ready to binge your content will buy. Bingers are buyers.

Jamie Bright [00:16:11]:
It's so weird to me that, like, our attention spans are either 1 to 2 seconds long and we just swipe, swipe, swipe, or we find something that catches our attention, we start to go down the rabbit hole, and the next thing you know, we have binged the entire Bridgerton season. When we capture somebody's attention and they really want what we have, they'll go into binge mode. If something is truly interesting to them and captures their attention in a really deep way, they will binge the entire thing. That's why I've created this lead magnet to be a bingeable email course, which means that at the end of every email there is a link that they can click to get the next email right away instead of waiting for the next one to show up in their inbox automatically after a fixed amount of time. And when people start to use that binge link, they get hooked. And what I have found after several months of running this lead magnet is that bingers are buyers. So if we can encourage them to binge and keep going deeper and deeper without breaking that attention and focus, we're not gonna lose out on the sale in the same way we might if we made them wait for the next part of our welcome sequence to show up and then wait again and then wait again. They can literally binge through my entire email course and buy within less than an hour if they want to.

Jamie Bright [00:17:27]:
It's really powerful to remove the friction of waiting for the people who are ready to keep moving forward. But the power of the lead magnet isn't just in the mechanics of the Binge link, which isn't that hard to set up by the way. You can do it in almost every major email software that's out there. The other key that's really important is what you write in the emails. And I've used several neuro based principles that build curiosity while providing value that make them want to click on that link and get the next email now. When you use these neuro based principles, not only will you hold their attention longer, but you'll also be able to build desire for your offer so that when you do invite them to purchase it, they are ready. They have already got a ton of value from you. They are excited about what you're offering.

Jamie Bright [00:18:18]:
They know it's gonna help them and they're ready to buy. So let me walk you through a few of the neuro based principles that I use in this lead magnet. So number 1, you can't be boring or predictable. Our brains are prediction machines. And so the moment that we read something that we already know, our brains are literally wired to say, oh, I've seen this before. I know where this ends. I don't need to keep reading. And it starts thinking about something else even if they're actually reading and you've lost their active attention.

Jamie Bright [00:18:47]:
And when you lose their active attention, it's really hard to get it back. The second way that this is different from traditional lead magnets is that we're not just giving how to content that tells them what to do or giving them a Canva template that they can take and run with and never have to come back to you for anything again. Now I'm a huge advocate of giving real value to our clients, but if all you're doing is giving them the answers on how to do something, you're not gonna get paid. And we are not charities, we are businesses and so we need to write our bingeable email courses to both provide value and yes some of that is through how to's, but it can't just be that. It needs to be designed to build desire for our core offer and be perceived as so valuable even when you're not talking about your offer that they can't stop binging and are excited to buy when they get to the end of your series. I don't even mention my product name until several emails into the series because it's not relevant at that point. I'm helping them understand what's really happening before I'm ever giving them an option to work with me to get that result, but it's not just fluffy bro marketing, it's actual value that holds their attention and helps them think about what they want in a different way. You also want to include neuro based to binge mechanisms in your emails to make them wanna continue reading.

Jamie Bright [00:20:14]:
Our brains are wired to find the answers to questions and so when we can incite curiosity and make them wonder what's coming next and what is really gonna happen, then they're more likely to continue binging to find out the answer and learn the next piece of value that we have for them. The goal is to provide so much value and to keep them hooked that by the time the offer is actually introduced and they're invited to purchase it, they're excited to you. They already want it. They already trust you. They've learned so much from the first few emails that they're ready to take that next step and move on with you because they want the transformation that you've offered them, and they're ready to go deeper into your world. The goal of the bingeable email course isn't to pressure and coerce and give them just enough to say, oh, here's what we can do but you've got to buy something to do it. It's actually to empower them to make a good buying decision, to see if this is really gonna work for them, to see how it's different from what everyone else is doing, to believe that there's gonna be real tangible value inside based on what you've already given them for free, and then to invite them to buy if they feel like it's a good fit for them. I like to think of it as empowering as opposed to convincing because it feels so much better.

Jamie Bright [00:21:32]:
Now there's actually several more neuro based principles that I put into this lead magnet, but I don't have time to fit them all into this specific presentation here. And frankly the best way for you to really understand it is to experience it. So I actually have a free bingeable email course that goes even deeper into each of the pieces that are made up in this lead magnet that's converting for me, and that will teach you all of the nuances and principles that go into this lead magnet so that you can create a truly effective bingeable email course yourself. It also is gonna tell you the exact technology that you need to set it up, which by the way it's not as hard as you probably think. And inside of this free bingeable email course, I will give you the exact word for word email that I send it every single new subscriber that virtually guarantees I end up in the inbox, and it tells you how to set it up so that you can have that up and ready to go within a matter of minutes. It's really simple. I walk you through it step by step, and it's also included in the free bingeable email course. Plus you'll be able to see exactly how I'm getting 1 to $2,000 sales through this lead magnet as you go through the bingeable email course.

Jamie Bright [00:22:45]:
So the link for that is somewhere below this video. It should be in a button near my bio, so definitely go and check that out. But if you have any further questions about the bingeable email course that I created as a new lead magnet, First, I would go through that bingeable email course. You literally can do it right after this video and go through the entire thing all at once because it's bingeable. You don't have to wait for the different emails to get dripped out to you. Plus, I'll also be in the Facebook group for this summit answering questions. So go through the bingeable email course and then come there and ask because I would be more than happy to answer any questions you have about it. You can also email me personally at jamie@wearebrightertogether.com, and I'll personally respond to any questions you have for me there.

Jamie Bright [00:23:29]:
