All right. I think we're live. Yes. Okay, so yay. Hi, everyone. Welcome to the Monetization panel, day four of the summit. And fingers crossed we have no tech issues with today's panel. Airing the last couple of days was a little tough, so third time's a charm. Hopefully everyone can see us. I want to give a big warm welcome to our panelists, which right now, you're just seeing Amanda and I will tell you more about her in a second. Jenny is going to be jumping on in a bit. She has to wrap up a different call. Just schedule. It happens. So let me share a little bit about our wonderful panelist. Amanda is a simplicity focused content marketing strategist and host of Chasing Simple, a podcast to help creative entrepreneurs uncomplicate their life and biz. She traded in her classroom lesson plans for speaking and educating creative entrepreneurs on sustainability fitting content marketing sustainability fitting content marketing into their business without it taking over their business. I'm all too familiar with that. She's now a two time business owner. It happens to everybody. She spends her time helping one on one clients, creating content marketing strategy, and teaching our students to batch their content so that they have time to move the needle in their business.

[00:01:23.820] - Liz Stapleton, Host
If her nose isn't in a book, you can find her annoying her husband by slipping Disney into every conversation or by forcing her cats to snuggle. Amanda big warm welcome. Thank you so much for being here.

[00:01:35.760] - Amanda Warfield
Thank you for having me, Liz. I'm really excited to be here today.

[00:01:39.040] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Yes. And she is fighting off a cold, so really, fingers crossed you feel better soon. I'm going to just share a little bit about Jenny before she jumps on. She's a former reading specialist who retired from her teaching career I didn't realize we had two teachers on here. When her blogging income far exceeded her salary. Through hard work and dedication, her lifestyle blog, The Melrose Family, became regularly sought out by nationally recognized brands such as Neutrogena, Smuckers, Glad, Costco, Family, Femur, Sarah Lee, and many more. She is a content strategist that helps entrepreneurs better understand their messaging and unique position in the online space. Now she's combining her passion for teaching with her extensive experience of creating strategic content for online business owners via JennyMelrose.com. And her podcast Influencer Entrepreneurs with Jenny Melrose as well as her first book Influencer Entrepreneurs the Four Step framework to building your audience, growing your business, and making more money online. Okay, so we have very fortunately had a lot of questions presubmitted. I don't know that we're going to be able to answer all the I don't know that we'll have the answer to all of them.

[00:02:41.400] - Liz Stapleton, Host
We will go through all of them. But if you guys have more questions, comment. Hopefully everyone can see us. Let me go ahead and pull up the first question. So the first question is my email list doesn't seem to like sales emails at all. And that's an all caps. Every time I send one, I lose a ton of subscribers. What do I do? Do you want to speak first?

[00:03:09.290] - Amanda Warfield
Sure. I think my thought, my first initial thought is just normal. There are going to be people that they opt in to your freebies, and that's all they're interested in. And then when they see a sales email, they're out. And it is what it is. There's no getting around that. You're not going to please everyone, and not everyone who finds you is going to stick around forever. They're going to stick around for a time. And that time may be short or maybe long, but no one's going to stay forever.

[00:03:37.270] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Yeah, I would agree. And I know it's hard, especially when you're trying to grow your list. In the beginning stages, every unsubscribe hurts a little bit. But one of the things that took me a while to realize but to really embrace is you need to celebrate those unsubscribes. Okay. They're cleaning up your list for you. Generally with email marketing, you have to pay for your list. And so if they're not going to buy from you, or if they're not going to buy from you, okay, see you later. Like a okay with me. If you're not going to buy from me eventually, then don't cost me money now. I'm okay with that. So I know it's tough, especially when it happens with sales emails, especially. But if you're finding that you're getting lots of unsubscribes and you're still not getting any sales, I don't know. If that's the issue, then you probably need to look at your positioning would be my guess, because you're not really talking to the problems that they have and how your product solves that problem or whatever product you're from. And maybe it's an affiliate thing. So I would say don't stress the unsubscribes.

[00:04:39.660] - Liz Stapleton, Host
I would worry. If you're still not getting sales and you're getting lots of unsubscribes, you may need to adjust things. You're always going to have unsubscribes, so it doesn't even matter. I do every year I run Freebie February, where I send a freebie out every single day and those emails get unsubscribes. Okay. It just happens. And they're doing you a favor by unsubscribing. They're not the right people for you, or they're not going to buy. They're helping you out without you having to go through the process of cleaning your list.

[00:05:07.250] - Amanda Warfield
Yeah, and on top of that, I mean, like you said, you pay for however big your list is, especially as it grows. But also the more people you have on your list, it lowers those conversion rate numbers. Right. You're going to have a lower click rate. You're going to have a lower open rate. And the lower those numbers are, the more likely that Gmail or whoever their email provider is is going to think that you're spam and so actually lower numbers with better conversion rates is so much better in so many different ways than, oh, I have 5000 people on my email list, but no one buys anything.

[00:05:42.510] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Yeah, it's better to have 500 people and you have like a super high ConvertKit rate. No, I'm not going to lie. I will be taking the attendee list and you guys will be I'll be like, hey, you can stay here or you can unsubscribe there's that email coming after the summit. Because if you're just here for the summit, that's fine. I'm okay with that, but I don't need to pay to have you on my list. Okay, the next question we got is out of all of the monetization strategies, what is the one that brings in the majority of your revenue? I like that question.

[00:06:18.570] - Amanda Warfield
That is a good question. I think this is important to know that this does change depending on your phase of business, which is why streams of revenue and multiple streams of revenue are so important. So in what mine is right now, I don't know how helpful that is to anyone watching because your business is going to be totally different. The phase of your business and the phase of your life is going to be totally different. But for me personally, right now, my biggest stream of revenue is my one to one clients.

[00:06:49.330] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Okay, yeah, mine is Digital Products, but that is because I moved away from client work and it took me time to do that. That was like, my goal for that. I finally phase out the last client last year. But that had been my goal, was to phase out clients over a couple of years, actually, because I didn't really want to be doing one on one work anymore. But I would say at the beginning, the first money I earned was probably an affiliate commission and then a little teeny tiny bit from ads. And then I started doing client work is probably the easiest thing to build up quickly. But then you're busy with client work and you're trying to build up your other streams, and that canva be tricky. So while it is Digital Products for me now, I can tell you I tried to sell Digital Products years ago and failed miserably. So if you're trying to do Digital Products now because you're like, oh, big bloggers make the most from Digital Products and it's not going well for you, that doesn't mean that's never going to go well for you. It could just be you're not quite there yet.

[00:07:58.010] - Liz Stapleton, Host
For Digital Products to really make up the majority of your income, you do need a fairly sizable audience and a fairly engaged audience. So I don't have a huge email. Like, I first of all, terrible at social media marketing. Don't really do it or do it very poorly. So I'm mainly marketing to my email list, and I regularly scrub that list. So I've had tons and tons of emails, but my list, I think, is under 5000 right now because I regularly scrub, but it's got an average open rate of like 50% and a click through, you know, like so it's a very engaged list. ConvertKit does the like how engaged they are? And I was like, oh, I have zero one stars. Cool. So you do need an engaged audience. It doesn't need to be huge to make a full time income. And as Amanda said, one on one, I think is really easy to scale up, to be a full time and to be your biggest, if that's your goal.

[00:08:56.810] - Amanda Warfield
And it's such a nuanced conversation because I started my business with Courses, the teacher, and he was like, that's what I'm doing. I didn't take one to one clients for years. And then once I had a foundation because it was a side hustle, it was, I'm teaching in the day, and I don't have time for one to one clients, so let's see what I can do just in my spare time. And then once I had a foundation, I was like, oh, now I'll take on a few. I only take on I think I have six clients right now, and I'm at my max for one to one clients. That's all I'm doing. And yes, it's my biggest stream right now, but it's not my only stream. And I only got there because I set those boundaries. And I started with those Digital Products, and now I have revenue streams where I'm not like, oh, all I do is client work. I have the additional streams. But it's such a nuanced conversation because it's not as simple as, well, my biggest stream is Digital Products. You should be Digital Products.

[00:09:54.030] - Liz Stapleton, Host
It's niche specific, too, right? So my Digital Products are for online business owners, so that's an audience that knows and likes to buy digital products, right. My personal finance site, that's like ads and affiliate revenue, a home decor site. Your biggest thing might be affiliate revenue, and you can grow that really big. But Digital Products might be a little confusing to your audience, or there's only a low cost one you can do. Or maybe you're doing one on one consulting on design. There are ways to do it, but it's going to vary. Yeah, you probably see a lot of stats that bloggers. Digital Products are the biggest, but I would look at what niche there because that does make a difference. Like home decor, affiliate focus sites can also get a ton of ad revenue. It just varies. Since ad revenue hasn't been, like, a huge goal of mine, it's not something I a lot of my sites don't have ads on them at all. So it depends on your niche. It depends on, I think, your goals and your time, and also what you.

[00:11:03.680] - Amanda Warfield
Just mentioned there of your own personal wants. You're not super interested in doing ad stuff personally for some of your sites. So you're not putting you don't have to have every revenue stream that's out there. Just focus on the ones that make you happy and excite you.

[00:11:17.540] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Yes. Yes, absolutely. Okay, let me go find the other questions. This is one that I'm not sure that I will have an answer to, and I don't know that you will either, but what is the most profitable print on demand company? I was like, I have no clue. That's really not my zone of genius there. So, I'm going to refer you to think I would go find a blogger that blogs about selling print on demand. Ecommerce artists, I feel like, probably have a lot of that information where they get their art printed on things. I don't have that answer. I'm sorry. Next pre submitted question. If we're going to talk about Amazon affiliation, if you have already tried it and failed miserably because I wasn't ready, is there a way to get back into the affiliate program with Amazon? The answer is yes. My understanding is yes. Hey, I've done. It like I failed the first time I tried to maybe even the second. I don't know. It was a long time ago. But yes, you can get back in. But I think it changes your Amazon associated ID, so then you have to update all your links, which can be easily done.

[00:12:37.730] - Liz Stapleton, Host
It can be a pain, too, depending on how you go about it, but it's not impossible. I don't know if you want to add anything about Amazon Associates if you do much there. I don't do a lot there. Debbie Gartner is my go to for Amazon stuff. Yeah.

[00:12:49.450] - Amanda Warfield
I'm honestly surprised I haven't been kicked out of the program because I get clicks, but I don't really get sales.

[00:12:56.150] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Yeah, the only reason I still in, I think, is because of holidays and Black Friday pulled in. I've got a few articles that rank really well and so always get a couple of sales around the holidays. And then I try to push Prime Day, but I never do that well with it because it's just not I don't know. So, yes, you can. If you are looking for help with Amazon Associates and Growing, that Debbie Gartner, who is a speaker, she has some great resources on that, and so I would steer you towards that. And Jenny, when she comes on, maybe she'll have something else to add to that. We will kind of ask her these questions too, but you can absolutely get back in. You have to realize you might need to update things. Okay. All right, so next up is, do you have any suggestions for a WordPress plugin to add a course to my website? I started looking at them, and there's so many. The only thing I know for sure is that I know I'll be using video. What do you use for your stuff?

[00:13:57.440] - Amanda Warfield
I don't think I'm helpful in this one either. Unfortunately. I like to use. Currently, I'm using Kartra. I've also used Teachable in the past and really loved it. But I tend to use a separate course specific platform just because I like the customer side of things. I like the way they look and they feel versus also it's easier than building on my website because I'm not tech savvy.

[00:14:22.650] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Yeah, I always try to do things. So. Yes, I've done Teachable. I've done Podia. I mean, I did Teachable back when it was called Fedora. That was actually Teachable's original name in case anyone's wondering. I've done Podia. I've also done. I think I've tried, like wishlist member maybe or member mouse thrive apprentice. And then I think WP courseware was what I've tried most recently, which I did like, but my students did find it confusing. So I did like a sub domain. I liked it, I thought it looked nice, but I think it was a little confusing for them. And so right now, everything I'm using is on Thrive Cart Learn, with the exception of audio access stuff, which I use sound wise because I got a lifetime deal on AppSumo, because half my stuff, I got lifetime deal on AppSumo. I'd say out of all of those, I feel like Thrivecar, thrive Cart is what we so now. Love it. Thrive apprentice is by thrive themes and I for a while did everything with Thrive themes I think it was a great suite. I ended up switching away from it because it had some site speed issues, which I believe they've since fixed.

[00:15:45.250] - Liz Stapleton, Host
And I like that all their stuff kind of just CoWorks together, so it's almost like using a Kartra, but you still get the flexibility of WordPress. So I would probably look into that. Everything I've seen is there's a lot of functionality. Apprentice, when I first used it, which is their courseware side of stuff, but it is like a whole suite of products and it's affordable. It has like a lot of functionality of being able to lock stuff out and charge and things like that. So if I had to pick, if I had to go build again and I was newer, I might go the Thrive Themes route again because it was just super easy for me when I was struggling with understanding all the tech. I mean, WP Courseware was good, but it just creates a lot of confusion, I think, from the user standpoint, so I don't know if that's helpful. Let me see. Okay. Oh, I've got Mariah, I like using Thrive Cart for your stuff Liz. Thanks, Mariah, that was a really long winded answer. But it also depends on what other tools you're using and what integrates what's your email marketing service.

[00:17:04.670] - Liz Stapleton, Host
But I'd always start with what's the user experience going to be, right? Because if they're going to be confused, they're not going to log in and access and find things and you'll probably end up with higher cancellation if you've got a subscription and things like that. I don't know if you want to add to that.

[00:17:22.930] - Amanda Warfield
No, I think user experience is so important. That's why I ended up both with Teachable and with Kartra when I eventually moved over, was because I had taken courses that utilize those, and I was like, I love the way this feels. It's easy as a user. And frankly, Kartra, the back end is not pretty for me. It's not as great as some of the other things I've seen, but I love the user flow, and so I sacrifice my needs to hopefully provide my people with a better experience.

[00:17:53.230] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Yeah. And I think correct me if I'm wrong, but I've definitely bought bundles. I'm sure you have to. And that's one thing I look at during the I'm like, how is this? Is this nice? Like, I recently I was like, I don't need another bundle, but did I buy one? Yes. Oh, no. It was like Lizzie's Christmas party, which was awesome. And I was like, but some of them I'm like, okay, a couple of you guys are on this platform that I've never used it for, and I got to say I don't like it. I can't find things. How do I get that worksheet? Is it just not here, or am I missing it? You'll find as you do this more and more as a blogger and as you experience others courses, you'll make a note. It just happens. Okay, we've got another question. Have you all used Evergreen webinars to sell your products and services, and do they work things? Have you ever done an Evergreen webinar? You have an evergreen summit going, right?

[00:18:48.150] - Amanda Warfield
I do have an Evergreen summit, and I have an Evergreen webinar. I have not done a great job of driving traffic to this, which is the problem. Do they work?

[00:19:00.580] - Amanda Warfield
Yes.

[00:19:00.980] - Amanda Warfield
I've seen it work for so many different people. Is it working for me currently? No. And I know why. It's because I'm not driving the traffic to them.

[00:19:09.830] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Yeah, I have an Evergreen webinar for it's, like, seven things you need to know about the legal side of blogging or whatever. If I look at the traffic to it and the number of conversions, yes, it works. Do I drive enough traffic to it so that I can scale that? No, I do not. Feel free to go check it out and help me out with that.

[00:19:35.630] - Jenny Melrose
I know.

[00:19:36.320] - Liz Stapleton, Host
I'm like, okay, well, three people viewed it, and one person bought, so that's a great conversion rate, but I don't truly know. They don't have enough data to say on a scale difference. And I want to learn ads at some point and try that, but just hasn't happened. So one of my things this year is to collaborate more and go be a guest speaker and stuff and then try to drive some traffic to that.

[00:20:01.380] - Amanda Warfield
I will say something to keep in mind with evergreen, like evergreen funnels period versus live launching. We see so many different people who are like, oh, live launching is the way, or Evergreen funnels are the way. And they both definitely have their pros and cons, but they really have to be used in conjunction with each other, because when you look at conversion rates, a live launch or a live evergreen webinar is going live evergreen webinar, live webinar is going to have a conversion rate that's in the like 20% to 30%. An evergreen funnel or webinar is only going to have like a 2% conversion rate. And so, yes, it's great for not exhausting yourself and not having to be live for a full week, but you have to have significantly more traffic to get the same amount of sales. And so if you use them in conjunction with each other, do the live launches still once or twice a year, while you're then also running evergreen things on the back end, fixing the evergreen funnels and learning how to scale them better, great. But that conversion number is really important to keep in mind, because I think sometimes we say, oh, I'm going to have an evergreen webinar funnel, and it's going to do as well as my live one, and then it only converts to 2% and you're upset and it's like, no, that's what it should be doing.

[00:21:10.820] - Liz Stapleton, Host
An industry standard. Yeah. So conversion rates vary. That's a really good point. I'd also point out that I have that evergreen webinar, which leads to my legal templates, but I sell my legal templates just without the webinar, too. And that actually brings in more. I think that's an easier thing for people to see. It kind of just depends. But I would just don't overcomplicate it, too. If you're just getting started with it, you don't need deadline funnel. You can use other timers. So yeah, I would just say try to keep it as simple as possible. An evergreen webinar especially is really easy to get over, complicated with a lot of different moving pieces. So that would be my two cent if you're looking at doing evergreen. All right, let me see if any other questions have popped up. Let me make sure we covered all this. I want to go back to that because we talked about course thing on what kind of course plug in, and she said she knew she would be using video. A lot of course hosting platforms don't have video hosting. So you might still like you might end up I ended up using Vimeo because the part doesn't have it, I think, like Podia, Teachable like those do to a certain extent.

[00:22:38.400] - Liz Stapleton, Host
I don't know about Kartra.

[00:22:39.970] - Amanda Warfield
It does now. When I first started using it, it was using Vimeo as well. But now they've started yeah.

[00:22:45.200] - Liz Stapleton, Host
SEO. I mean, that is one thing to consider, especially when you're looking at the cost, because if you're going to be using video, you might need to pay for video hosting elsewhere. And I like vimeo because you can lock it so it can only be shown on certain domains or web pages so that it's not just viewable to everybody. So just throwing that out there. Okay, let me see if you guys have questions. Please comment. I don't think Jenny has jumped on just yet. I think she's going to join at like 1130. Let's hope. All right. Yeah. Mariah, I'm sorry. We don't know much about print on demand. That is something I wanted to dip my toes in, but it hasn't happened yet. Okay, let me just double check. Okay. So just kind of keep things rolling. Amanda, so I know you said one on one is your current big revenue generator, but what are some maybe mistakes you've made in monetizing in the past that would be helpful for others to learn from? I always think it's great to hear successes and failures.

[00:23:57.150] - Amanda Warfield
Yeah. Oh, man, I've made so many mistakes. I think, honestly, the biggest thing that I would love everyone to learn from me, though, is kind of going back to that idea of conversion rates, expectations for what you're doing. When I first started my business, like I said, I went right into courses because I love teaching. And I was like, oh, I can do digital courses. This is great. I can teach other people things still. I don't have to give up teaching fully because that was my biggest fear. Like, oh, I'm going to miss teaching so much. And I can remember first time I put out a digital product, it was actually a workbook. And I made this giant thermometer that you see people do with fundraisers. Made this giant thermometer and I hung it on our fridge and I was like, I'm going to sell 100 of these. Yes, exactly. I probably had 20 people on my email list. I don't know where I thought these 100 sales were coming from, but I was convinced we're going to sell 100 of them. And so I spend all this time working on it. I get beta readers, I get all this stuff, and then I start selling the workbook.

[00:25:03.430] - Amanda Warfield
And I think I sold six of them with like 20 people on my email list, which is an incredible right? It's incredible. But 2018, amanda did not know that. And I trashed the whole thing. I was like, this was a failure. I only sold six. Like, I deleted the whole workbook. I didn't do anything else with it. Now I'm like, wow, that was actually really great. I should have kept going with that. That was clearly a winning product. But my expectations did not match reality because I did not realize conversion rates are so important to understand and what industry standard is, and that you can't just make something and people, if you build it, they'll come like, that's not real. And we hear people tell us that's not real. All the time. But to really understand the reality of what that means, you have to have the people in your audience on your email list, in your social sphere, whatever that looks like. You've got to have the people there in order for the conversion rates to make something happen. And if the people aren't there, they're not going to randomly find you on the Internet.

[00:26:10.890] - Amanda Warfield
SEO is great, especially as you've built it up, and then random people can find you on the Internet. But at first, that's not going to happen. People aren't just going to magically find your Instagram post about a product you have. And so I just want that to actually encourage everyone. That sounds kind of doom and gloom, but I want that to encourage everyone that what you're doing is probably way better than you're thinking it is. You probably just don't have the numbers yet to sustain what it is that you're hoping to sustain.

[00:26:40.630] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Yes, it's actually something I'm doing right now, is I'm going back and looking at all the different things I've created over the years that I've kind of gotten shelved or they've for whatever reason, I'm like there's a lot I'm like, oh, we're going to see if we can't do something with this. So I'm working on kind of reviving some things. No, I love that because and, guys, conversion rates, we're not just talking about sales conversion rate can mean okay, for example, the Evergreen Webinar, how many people actually opted in to watch the webinar? Okay, if 100 people hit the opt in page, how many registered? What is that conversion rate? If it's free, it should be fairly high. A sales conversion rate is going to be much, much lower. And so just keeping in mind what you're measuring and what a good expectation is to set and to realize that those kind of goals you don't have complete control over. So you can have a goal to write six blog posts that lead to that opt in, but a goal of getting 100 people to opt in, you don't have control over that necessarily. You can kind of finagle it.

[00:27:53.090] - Liz Stapleton, Host
You're like, well, if it's got a 50% conversion rate, means I need to get 200 people so, my blog post has this, like you can really math it out. You can really nerd out, although to a certain extent, it's procrastination. But just kind of try to keep in mind the goals that you have control over and the ones you don't. Results focused goals are great to have, but you don't have a lot of control over them. So just to kind of curb your expectations in that regard would be my suggestion. But yeah. Amanda, I've failed so many times at Monetization and products like the first, and there was this huge thing years ago, and it sounds like you kind of did too, where you had, like, beta testers for free or something, right? Did your beta testers, get free access so that you can get testimonials. That was the thing. And I mean, that's fine, but you won't really know if it's going to sell unless someone is willing to put their money where their mouth is. They may be willing to give you feedback, but if they had to, what they've paid for it.

[00:28:52.770] - Liz Stapleton, Host
So I think pre selling, which is something that we've gone over the summit before previous years, and Liz Wilcox talks about a lot. I think that's actually her bonus in the all access pass is the way to go, like presale before you make it so that you can kind of create it in conjunction with the people that were willing to put money down and create something that will really help them. And you'll still get the testimonials and the feedback and all the information you want. And that way you're not spending a ton of time creating something that doesn't sell or that does, and you don't think it does, and then you throw it away, which, by the way, the comment is resting. That workbook. Honestly, I wish you had it somewhere that you could pull it out. You fully deleted it. You were like, I don't want the clutter.

[00:29:43.810] - Amanda Warfield
I think I was just so frustrated.

[00:29:46.290] - Liz Stapleton, Host
This business is a fail heartbreaking.

[00:29:49.630] - Amanda Warfield
So frustrated. It was a mistake.

[00:29:53.650] - Amanda Warfield
I shouldn't have deleted it.

[00:29:54.870] - Amanda Warfield
I mean, obviously everyone who paid for it got it. But then I was like, I don't need this. I'm not selling this anymore, to reach.

[00:30:00.330] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Out and be like, do you and if you still have this, send me a copy.

[00:30:05.110] - Amanda Warfield
I don't know if I want to see it.

[00:30:06.490] - Amanda Warfield
My design work is bad now. I don't know if I want to see it.

[00:30:09.850] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Oh, my gosh, guys, if you're not cringing out, like, the first version of a product or the first version of your site of a blog post or whatever, like, you're not growing, you should see. I'm pretty sure one of my first site designs on my horribly named site was, like, orange and teal. It was so clashing, you couldn't even read it. I mean, that was like the header. That wasn't like the actual text. It wasn't that bad, but it was bad. So, look at us now. Right? But don't let sometimes just getting it out there, even if it's not pretty, that's worth it. Content, the actual quality of the content is going to matter more than what it looks like unless it's set up in a way that they can't accessibility. Right, yeah. Or that they just it's so confusing. Okay. Oh, Jenny's here. Yeah. So, yeah, that is just seriously, don't worry about looks too much. All right. Hey, Jenny. She's coming in. Renee says always start small.

[00:31:13.840] - Amanda Warfield
Yes, definitely. That's another mistake I made, was I would start with these massive plans, and then I would finish them and a few months later be like, wow, I've learned so much I need to change everything.

[00:31:25.960] - Amanda Warfield
So.

[00:31:26.160] - Amanda Warfield
That's a great reason to start small. It's just you're going to learn and grow so much. Start really small so that instead of let me change everything, it's just let me build upon what I've done.

[00:31:35.370] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Yes. Big welcome to Jenny. Jenny, thank you so much for jumping on I've already introduced you to everybody, but we're going to go ahead. We've covered some questions, but I want to get your take on them. So I'm going to kind of like, fast question you. Whatever speed round, get your intake. First one I want to ask in case you do have some insight, because neither Amanda or I did do you know anything about print on demand?

[00:32:05.230] - Jenny Melrose
Print on demand? As far as, like, using Amazon through KDP or what are they talking about?

[00:32:10.360] - Liz Stapleton, Host
They're like, what is the most profitable print on demand company? And it was not something either Amanda or I could help them with.

[00:32:19.490] - Jenny Melrose
No, I don't have insight as far as that. I think it really depends on what it is. Could it be an ebook? Could it be something that could be? Because if it can be done ebook wise, that would be the route I would definitely recommend. As far as going through whether you're going to do Etsy or Amazon, the big thing you need to remember is that it may not seem as profitable percentage wise, but they're their own marketplace. So SEO comes into play when you use Amazon or Etsy.

[00:32:50.030] - Liz Stapleton, Host
No, that's a great point. Okay, next question for you. Out of all the monetization strategies, what is the one that brings in the majority of your revenue?

[00:32:58.600] - Jenny Melrose
Okay, so when I had my lifestyle blog, The Melrose Family, which I had started in 2009 and then sold it for six figures in 2019, for ten years on it, I made the majority of my money from sponsorships. I love sponsorships. I was good at them. I knew how to price myself and how to pitch myself. And I loved writing that content because I always was able to make it work for my audience and authentically fit my brand. And I was never a blogger that had a huge social media presence. I didn't have over 10,000 followers on Instagram. I never had over 250,000 page views. I was what I would consider a micro influencer. But I knew how to turn them into long term deals so that instead of it being a one and done working on a campaign, it turned us to something more long term.

[00:33:52.850] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Okay. Can you maybe provide a tip on how you would do that?

[00:33:57.010] - Jenny Melrose
Of course not. I think the first thing as far as when it comes to pitching and working in sponsorships, you have to go after know that you need to go after the brands are a good fit for you. So find the brands that you're already talking about, you already use in your content, whether you are a food blogger, whether you are DIY or decor, whether you do time savings, kind of productivity, look and see what are the things that you are already using, and reach out to those brands. Put together a pitch where you're going to be able to show your positioning, who your audience is, because that's what's most important to them. The first time you try to work with a brand, you are trying to work with them on a one campaign with multiple deliverables so that you're giving, whether it's a blog post, social media shares, you're doing multiple things for them, including sending an email to your list. Especially if you have a list and it's a package price, you do not tell them, I charge this for that, this for that, and this for that. You say for $1,500, you're going to get a blog post, three Instagram stories, an Instagram post, a TikTok, an email to your list, all depending upon, of course, what the value is for those for you, depending upon page views, engagement, all the things.

[00:35:10.170] - Jenny Melrose
And then from there, once you have that one campaign, turning it into long term becomes being able to provide them with data. So after the campaign is done, being able to report back to them and say, listen, these were your KPIs, the performance indicators that you were looking for. Here's the data that I can provide. This is the engagement that we saw on Instagram. These are the click throughs that we had, whatever it is that you can provide them with, I'd love to put together a long term campaign in order to continue to work with you. And that honestly, is the trick, is being able to show them the data that they can take to their boss and say, here's why we pay influencers. This is why we're doing this. Because oftentimes they can't do that. And it's because bloggers and influencers are dropped on the ball and don't know what they're doing with data, you have to.

[00:35:57.390] - Liz Stapleton, Host
 okay, yes, I like that. Are you using like Google Analytics and stuff when you're evaluating that data, that information?

[00:36:05.450] - Jenny Melrose
Yeah, I'm using Google Analytics. As far as page views, I'm also then going to use my email service provider to be able to show what my open rate, my click through rate, and then I'm using Instagram, any sort of data that the social media platform hands on that they provide with.

[00:36:22.260] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Yes. Okay. And then another question that we've touched on already, but I would love your input is do you have any suggestions for a WordPress plugin to add a course to my site? There's so many I know all doing video and so we gave lots of various information, but I don't know if there's something in particular you like to use or that you would recommend avoiding or what.

[00:36:44.940] - Jenny Melrose
I think the first thing that you want to look at is that if you are going to have plugins, you need to see if they are going to slow your site down. The last thing that you want to do is throw on a bunch of plugins that slows down your site speed, that drops your SEO. If you are trying to find new leads, you need to be doing your keyword research and your SEO needs to be good. So having a plug in that could technically potentially slow it down is going to be a deficit to you. I would actually say look at outside software. Look at outside software that you can pay them a monthly fee for it. They will process payments, they will do all the things, affiliate sales pages, email, all of it. And that way when something goes wrong, it's not on your end customer service, it's their end of being able to have to fix this. Why is this not working? Why is that not working? You have more support that way. There's all sorts of different ones. I was with Teachable for years. I have switched to Podia since and love Podia.

[00:37:38.670] - Jenny Melrose
There's Kajabi. There's so many different ones that are out there. But that would be my recommendation. I'm not big on plugins. I always recommend minimal amount of plugins that you can possibly have on your site is the best way to be.

[00:37:52.160] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Yeah. Both Amanda and I use she uses Kartra. I use Thrivecart Lear , which is a lifetime deal. Throw no one out there. I do pay for Vimeo though. That's not lifetime and that is a recurring cost. So I guess it's not fully, but still it's less than what I was paying with Podia or Teachable or whatever, both of which I've used. All right. And then the other kind of question I would love to hear your take on is are there any monetization mistakes you've made that you think would be helpful to learn from? Because I think it's just as important to learn about failures as successes. So I'd be curious to hear about any failures you've had that were especially helpful to learn from.

[00:38:34.240] - Jenny Melrose
I think the biggest thing is that I didn't realize I was making the mistake as a blogger, was that I didn't know the problem that I was solving for my audience. And I know that sounds so silly, but we often start off as a hobby and we create content. We put it out there and we put it up for the world and we're creating a recipe, we're doing cute little decor or whatever it might be, and we're not figuring out who the people are that we're trying to attract and the problem that we're solving for them. And I think I see that across the board with my clients still. That is always the first thing that we have to solve as a problem for them is what are you solving? What makes you different? How are you going to stand out from the rest of us? Because when you figure that out. That's how you're able to monetize. You can do sponsorships, you can do affiliates, you can have your own products and services because you know the problem that you solve for your audience. So I would say that's where I would honestly start, because the response I always get is, oh, I create easy.

[00:39:34.160] - Jenny Melrose
Blah, blah, blah, blah.

[00:39:35.060] - Jenny Melrose
Whether it's DIY recipes, whatever it is, it's always easy. And they're trying to attract a huge ocean full of people, when in reality, that's not what you should be doing. If you want to niche down, figure out where your people are, and be able to just create those raving fans that can come to you knowing that you are going to be able to solve their problem at an expert level.

[00:39:59.270] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Yes. And you can see a real example of that in this summit, Amanda talks about batching, as does Cara Harvey. Cara is focused on helping super busy moms, and Amanda is focused on trying to keep things simple, like, don't try to do all the things right. So they're both in the batching space, but they're targeting different audiences with different problems that batching solves. And so if Amanda started to try to go after busy moms, that could not work so well for her, because that's not what she's been doing. And vice versa.

[00:40:30.860] - Amanda Warfield
Especially because I don't know anything about busy moms. Not being a mom.

[00:40:33.620] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Exactly. Mom doesn't count.

[00:40:38.450] - Amanda Warfield
No, not in this case.

[00:40:40.470] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Exactly. So that's what I'm saying is you may have the same solution as another blogger, but the way you present it and what it is, that how you suggest they go about it, because of who they are and the problems they have is completely different.

[00:40:58.170] - Jenny Melrose
And the way that they can make that connection too, because the stories that you're going to share are going to be very different. I'm going to talk about my kids because I have kids, and it's part of being an entrepreneur with kids, and that will let some connect and others it may not. That doesn't mean that they're going to totally be repelled by me and not want to get the value from me, but there will always be outliers. You're looking for those people that can really truly connect and become your people that will do all the things that you offer.

[00:41:28.530] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Yes. I don't know if you want to add to that. Sorry. I was, like, using you as an example. It's a good example. I try. It's weird because I don't have children, but I live with my niece and nephew, and so I do parent quite a bit, and so I'm like, in this in between, and I don't really know how to explain that.

[00:41:49.690] - Amanda Warfield
That's a whole niche of itself, though.

[00:41:51.760] - Liz Stapleton, Host
That's true. Okay, does anyone else want to ask some questions? We've got about ten minutes or so left, and while we kind of wait for some more questions to come in, do you guys have anything you want to make sure people know when it comes to monetizing or things you wish you had done at the beginning, anything along those lines.

[00:42:15.890] - Jenny Melrose
I would say grow your dang email list. Know what you're solving. Create an opt in, get them on your list, and utilize your list. Your list is the most valuable thing that you have other than your website. So if you are someone that started off just on social media and you're using rented property, because that's exactly what it is. It's rented property. It's something else that you can own, and you can own your email list and your website. So growing that is huge.

[00:42:48.570] - Amanda Warfield
I think I would fall back, as always, to the simplicity side of things, and we kind of touched on this a little bit earlier, but just there are so many different ways to grow your blog, and there are so many different ways to monetize your blog. Start with one. I really struggled at the beginning, trying to learn all the things about all the different ways. I mean, even just like, sitting here listening to Jenny, I'm like, oh, sponsorships, that could be something. That's not something I need to do right now. And I think a lot of us entrepreneurs, we have this, like, oh, I could monitor the second business thing. We all do it. We're like, oh, I could monetize this. Oh, I could build a business out of this. Because we're so good at it. And so we want to do it in all the ways. Start with one thing and get really darn good at it. And then start adding in other revenue streams. Yes, having multiple revenue streams is great. It is going to do so much for you. But they also become a lot to manage. And when you have five different revenue streams that are all kind of halfway done, halfway finished, because you did a little bit here and a little bit.

[00:43:48.830] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Here, bank account is going to be more than halfway empty.

[00:43:51.630] - Amanda Warfield
Yeah, exactly. So focus on one and learn everything you can about that one thing and put it all into practice and then start to expand. But don't try to do it all at the same time, because you're just going to be really scattered and really overwhelmed.

[00:44:08.550] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Yeah. And know what your goals are. Because if, you know, you want to monetize with ads, you need to focus on SEO. But if you're looking for digital to monetize with digital products, you really need to focus on growing your list. If you're looking to do affiliate marketing, it could be a combo, right? And so you need to balance those. It really just depends if you're looking to do one on one stuff. Maybe you need to build out a referral network. So kind of what your goal is, is going to determine which strategy you pursue and what you want to get really good at. All right, we have another question. I'm a new blogger and want to start affiliate marketing. Okay, this is not really okay. What legal pages do I need on my blog for you, sir? All blogs need a privacy policy. You need to make sure you have an affiliate disclosure. I totally, if you missed this earlier, have a webinar on the seven legal things you need to know about blogging, including stuff for affiliate marketing. You can find that on ElizabethStapleton.com. Just throwing that out there. Talked about how I don't drive enough traffic to it.

[00:45:08.410] - Liz Stapleton, Host
That is what you missed, Jenny, as we were talking about, and how we don't drive enough traffic to ours. That whole website is dedicated towards the legal side of blogging. I do have a background as an attorney, so I do know what I'm talking about. And you can find information there that's less to do with? That's a great question. It's just not very focused necessarily on the monetization part. It kind of is, but you need to make sure you're doing disclosures and stuff, but I will direct you to that website to get those answers. Any other questions? I think I got through all the ones that were presubmitted. Let me think. Is the panelist stuff was new this year, and so organizing it. I've got some tweaks to make for next year. I think that was all of them. Those were all the preset questions. Sweet. All right, let me check the chat. Okay. Can you explain how your best funnels work to sell your services and products and what's included in them? That is a great question and real broad, but let's see how much we can tackle that in the next 15 minutes lesson.

[00:46:40.080] - Jenny Melrose
Amanda, do you want me to go.

[00:46:41.540] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Or you want to go?

[00:46:42.160] - Jenny Melrose
Go ahead.

[00:46:42.630] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Yeah. Okay.

[00:46:44.000] - Jenny Melrose
All right, so I'll give an example from my business. So now I am best known for teaching bloggers how to pitch brands. My funnel starts off with a free guide. That is a pitching guide, walks you through the things that you need to have in a pitch letter, and then also includes swipe copy. From there. The next step in the funnel are the emails that come after that. And from that email, it then goes into inviting you to a webinar or a free workshop that I do called the Three Secrets Brands Are Not Telling You. During that workshop, I walk you through all the different secrets, and I also show you how my signature course, Pitch Perfect Pro is the solution that you're looking for. So it walks you through all the different issues that you will run into and how I give you the step by step on how to do that. Once you're done with the webinar, there are bonuses that get added if you purchase within a certain amount of time. So it's also part of the funnel, and then you also can get the replay. And then we also continue to tell you more about Pitch Perfect Pro, my signature program.

[00:47:50.270] - Jenny Melrose
From Pitch Perfect Pro, we then invite you, part of the sales funnel into my membership site. From the membership site, you then get invited into a Mastermind. So there's these layers of a funnel, and a lot of people think that it has to be you have to have a software. You can do all the hard things. It's literally an opt in. And then we're just sending you emails. That's all the funnel is. It's just email. And over the years, it has developed into knowing exactly what products and services my people need as next step. Some people will start right at the beginning with the freebie, and then others will jump in and want one on one coaching and come right into a Mastermind. It really depends upon how they hear about me and where they are in their journey. So I think your funnel, when you're starting, you want to think freebie to get into your list, then offering up a tripwire product or offering up something that's a lower cost item and then potentially going into more if you have more.

[00:48:52.290] - Amanda Warfield
Yeah, so that was a really great overview. I feel like, hard for us to really get into the nitty gritty of this because someone could create a summit on funnels, and it would still be too broad. Funnels for services are one thing. Funnels for products are another. But I think Jenny gave a really great overview of you start with a freebie, and then you lead them to the next thing. And that's really all it is, is knowing what your end goal is. What is that one product or service you're going to start with? What is that end goal? Okay, take one step back to what can you give them that's a freebie that's going to directly lead to that thing? So if their problem is that they need help with legal things, let's say that, and you've got a whole course on all the legal things you need to do to start your blog. Well, what's one step back? What's the problem before that? Well, before they can even wrap their mind around the legal side of things, maybe they just need someone to give them a checklist of, here's the things you need to worry about at the beginning.

[00:50:00.160] - Amanda Warfield
Here's the things that you don't. But you take that one step back, and then at the end of the freebie, you say, hey, if you want to take this the next step further, I've got a course on this. And I think that's the key to a funnel is you're always giving them the next step before you end the first step you've got. Here's the free thing, by the way, I have this course. And then you're going to send them some emails about the course, and then you're going to sell the course. Right. And then at the end of the course, like Jenny said, she's got a course and a membership and so on. At the end of the course, you talk about the membership, and at the end of this, you talk about that. And you're always kind of planting the seed for the next step as you're slowly walking them through. So you've got to take one step backwards. And a funnel can really be as simple as, here's the freebie, here are some emails that tell you about my offer. Here's the way to purchase the offer.

[00:50:49.450] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Yeah, it doesn't that is a funnel, an entire funnel. You can just have an email funnel. You don't need fancy software. You also don't need deadlines, necessarily. You see a lot of funnels with deadlines, tripwires or limited time discount stuff. And part of that is it goes into scarcity and making it more likely to buy. If you read Influence the Psychology of Persuasion, which is quite a fascinating read, and I think every online entrepreneur should read it. You learn kind of why there's these tactics, but you don't necessarily have to have them to get someone to buy because they're going to be like, that's the answer to my problems, right? You do it every day, right? I don't know. You go to Costco and you try the free samples and you're like, actually, that is the perfect thing for dinner tonight. And you don't need to be on sale. You just need to know that it's going to work for you. So I'd say don't worry about deadlines or Countdowns or, oh, I need the coupon to expire, otherwise it's always going to seem like it's available. And that's not genuine. And you don't necessarily need that at all for a successful funnel.

[00:52:05.080] - Liz Stapleton, Host
I mean, yeah, you can have those things. There's ways to do it, there's software and stuff. But if you're just starting out, don't overcomplicate it with those things would be kind of my two cents there. So, yeah, an opt in page, a thank you page that may or may not offer product or discount or something, but just say, hey, you're in. Look out for our email. It's got this subject line, whatever. And then through those emails, give them the next steps.

[00:52:33.770] - Jenny Melrose
I think one thing I would want to add to that too, is that just because something doesn't sell doesn't mean it sucks. Look at your data. How many people have actually seen it? Because I'm going to tell you right.

[00:52:45.710] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Now, you missed our first part.

[00:52:52.350] - Jenny Melrose
Well, I'll leave it at that then, because I can't tell you how many times clients come to me and they're like, it's not selling, it sucks. Like, how many people have seen it and they're like, oh, well, about 20. Is that sales page? No, about five on the sales page?

[00:53:10.950] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Yes. Go back and if you guys came in late, go back and rewatch that part where it meant. And I were talking about conversion rates and data and understanding good expectations maybe.

[00:53:20.880] - Amanda Warfield
Not deleting your whole workbook just because it only sold six when 20 people saw it, right? Maybe don't do that.

[00:53:28.030] - Liz Stapleton, Host
 Yeah, just a little tip there. Okay, so last few minutes, guys. Hopefully we kind of answer your question. Dietra. I know it was kind of a broad question. We tried to answer it as helpful as possible. If you guys have any last questions you want to submit, send them in the comments now while we just wait to see if any more comments. You guys, any final words you want to share?

[00:53:55.780] - Amanda Warfield
I feel like everything I say just always falls back on the keep it simple. Keep it as simple as you can. If you think you're keeping it simple, you're probably not keeping it simple enough. And I am preaching to myself with that as well. But man, it's so easy to over complicate things in this online space. I mean, like Liz was just saying, the deadline funnels and all of that, those things are great. Sure, they help, but is it the highest priority? No, it's a small tweak that can help. Once you have all the other things set up, it's not going to be the magic pill that is going to make your funnel, make you all kinds of money. This is going to bump up our.

[00:54:31.220] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Revenue a little bit more scale. This is going to help us scale. But you got to get it working before you can take that step.

[00:54:37.220] - Amanda Warfield
Yeah. So I think my advice is always stick to the basics. Keep it really simple. When you feel like you have a firm understanding of that, then you're going to know what the next steps are. We think we need these all these different people to tell us, oh, you need this and you need that. Once you really understand what it is that you're doing and what those back end funnels and things look like, you're going to know what needs to come next. And then you can search out someone who teaches that specifically versus, let me go find someone that just tells me all these things that I need to know.

[00:55:09.920] - Jenny Melrose
The only other thing that I would add is as a blogger that tried to drive traffic, that did all the social media, the difference, I think, in my business and when I look at clients businesses, is when they started to treat it like a business, is when that switch normally started to actually see money coming in. Instead of saying, oh, I'm just a blogger, or being able to just rearrange your schedule for a friend that stops by, or whatever it is, having boundaries within your working time is what's going to make the difference. And for those that maybe are not in that stage, maybe you have babies at home and you work when you can, that's fine too. It comes down to how you talk about your site and how you talk about what you're doing. Knowing that it is a business and not saying it can be or is it just a hobby? Being able to really see it as this is something I can make money from. I'm telling you, there are hundreds of thousands of bloggers out there that have made full time income being able to do this. But they started to treat it like a business.

[00:56:18.490] - Jenny Melrose
They put boundaries in place. They talked about it and were able to move it forward.

[00:56:23.700] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Yes. I love that. Adding to both of what you said. So treating it like a business. There was, of course, years ago, which sadly no longer exists, otherwise I would tell you about it. But one of the things that had you do was go print a bumper sticker with your URL on it and put it on your car. Like, advertise it on your car. Like, I'm terrifying. It is, but it really makes you commit to it. Right. You think more of it as a business if you're putting it as a bumper sticker on your car. And I still have that bumper sticker on my car. Thank goodness it was after the rebrand and the name is still accurate. And just adding to what Amanda said in terms of keeping it simple.

[00:57:04.360] - Liz Stapleton, Host
You've got to master the basics. You've got to know what you want to accomplish, and you will pivot. Don't be like, oh, I put all the work into this, and then be afraid to pivot if it's what's right for you, because your goals change. My goal was to become full time self employed, so I did client work. I became a freelance writer. I pivoted to pinterest management, and now I'm completely client free because I decided I didn't want to do that anymore. I've pivoted so many times. Partly why I have so many sites. But don't be afraid to pivot. Don't be afraid to just try new things, but always try the very basics first would be kind of what I would add. Yeah, I think that's it. Thank you guys so much for all your wonderful input and advice. We didn't get any last minute questions. Just comment that it was great advice. And thank you guys so much for your time. Thank you, everyone, for watching Jenny, Amanda, you're amazing guys. If you haven't gone and check out their sites and stuff, you should. They're super helpful on all the things. So I especially love Amanda's instagram and her cat pictures.

Yesterday was a heavy cat day, so if you guys go look now, you might still see some of them.
