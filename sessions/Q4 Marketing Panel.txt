Here.

[00:00:02.770] - Speaker 2
All right, it's looking like we're live double checking. I'm going to unmute that video real quick to make sure some ends. I will be sitting out ahead.

[00:00:11.730] - Speaker 1
Perfect.

[00:00:12.240] - Speaker 2
There's a nice little delay to keep it awkward. All right, guys, so for everyone just tuning in, we've been chatting for a minute about just all sorts of things. I'm very excited. We have gotten questions submitted. I am Liz. I'm your host of the blog Breakthrough Summit. And we have some fantastic panelists here. We've got Amarillo Braskin, who is a marketing strategist, I guess is the best way to put it. Ali Grummer, who talks about email marketing, ashley Mason, who talks about social media marketing, and then Madison, who talks about website design. And we're going to be tackling the topic of Q Four marketing. So if you guys have questions, drop them in the chat. I will be keeping an eye on it. I'm going to go ahead and kick this off with the first question that was submitted says, should you increase the amount of blog posts on your website during Q Four? For example, like blogtober, which, by the way, that's the first time I've heard that term where you blog daily. Who wants to kick this off?

[00:01:10.230] - Speaker 3
I will.

[00:01:12.310] - Speaker 4
I wouldn't focus my energy on blogging in Q Four just because it's more of a longer term and you're probably pretty busy. So for me and for my other clients, I generally don't have an uptick.

[00:01:27.620] - Speaker 5
In.

[00:01:29.950] - Speaker 4
That type of content that we're putting out during that time. As for blogtober, I have not heard of that or participated in it. I think if it's on brand for.

[00:01:41.510] - Speaker 6
You, go for it.

[00:01:43.080] - Speaker 4
That's awesome, but only if it makes sense. I don't think you need to feel.

[00:01:48.050] - Speaker 5
Like, pressure to do it.

[00:01:50.850] - Speaker 7
So I have heard of blogtober, which I just found out about it like, maybe a month ago. So this is like, interesting timing. I think the whole concept is to be kind of similar to Nanoremo, but with blog posts, I would say that my concern is sacrificing quality just to get to the quantity. And so I think if you're sitting there forcing yourself trying to write a blog post every single day, the chances of producing very high quality blog posts daily is probably slim to none. I know me personally, I get a little bit burnt out after I finish writing a blog post, and I definitely would not be able to mass produce in that sense. And so I think if you believe that you can produce at a high quality throughout the month, go for it. But you also really want to make sure that you're being intentional about your goals. And so don't blog just to blog. But what are you hoping to achieve from blogging? Are you hoping to grow your email list? Are you hoping to build thought leadership? Like, really think about the purpose before just diving in? Because that's a time consuming project that you don't want to throw hours and hours into to not get any return from.

[00:02:55.270] - Speaker 3
Yeah, I would definitely agree. And I was going to say the same thing about quality. You have to kind of know what you're capable of. I work with food bloggers mostly, but just content creators in general. You're going to want to work ahead when it comes to quarter four because most likely, and ideally, you're going to be taking some time off for the holidays. And so when you work ahead, it makes it a little bit harder to mass produce 30 blog posts in a month. That just gets me shivers even thinking about that. But if you're trying to work ahead, you're going to be kind of backlogging what you're working on. So in August, you might be working on posts for October and kind of sprinkling those in so that by the time it gets to the holidays, you can actually take time off. So I think I would recommend being more strategic with that approach of like, how much time do I want to take off? How can I work backwards to be able to give myself that space and the grace to do that rather than let me just pump out a bunch of content?

[00:03:50.430] - Speaker 3
Because like Anne Marie said, if you're mostly getting traffic from SEO, it's going to be next year before you get any of that traffic. So it's a balance for sure. But you don't also want to neglect doing any new content because when you are bringing new readers to your site, you want there to be new stuff, and you want there to be stuff to promote on social and email marketing and all of that stuff.

[00:04:14.530] - Speaker 2
And I would just add to that, if you're going to be doing more content, I would do it now, right, in August, September, and either schedule it ahead, like you guys said, or publish it now and give it time to mature and help pull people to you in Q Four. And then in Q Four, you can be focusing on marketing that content and whatever else you've got going on. Right? There's a reason Q Four is super profitable. It's super profitable for ads. It's super profitable for running sales, for doing affiliate marketing, because a lot of companies are running sales. Black Friday, Cyber Monday, all that stuff. So I would almost say, like, don't focus on more content in Q Four, but kind of marketing.

[00:04:55.710] - Speaker 6
Yeah, because the blogging portion is something that needs to be sustainable if that's the core part of your business. Like what you were saying, Ashley, if you double down, triple down, you're going to burn out. And what would it look like just to continue to create great content all year long? And the work that you're doing now, you will hopefully see the benefits of come January. So if you're like, I work with a lot of food bloggers as well. So if you're going to be doing a lot of healthy eating and meal prep and stuff like that, that you want to have ready to go for January for the Bridge is there for sure. But it's not as you know, like, SEO is not like a turnkey type. And now I get traffic because I published it today. We know that that's not the case. So definitely plan your personal energy and creative resources. Space them out, give yourself a grace in the room to do that.

[00:05:44.290] - Speaker 1
Well.

[00:05:46.910] - Speaker 2
Okay, the next two questions I feel like are very similar. They're specific. Like, how do I get brand sponsorship? How do I qualify for mediavine? And I think that the kind of core of that question is how do I grow my traffic to monetize in these ways? And obviously there's a lot of different ways to do it. I'm going to let you guys kind of speak to that.

[00:06:08.950] - Speaker 7
My favorite strategy is partnership marketing. So finding a partner that you can collaborate with and do some type of co authored piece of content, whether it's you interview them on your blog or they interview you on their blog, or just finding ways to do some type of joint content strategy and then therefore getting seen in front of their audience. Because the goal will be to then get their followers or their website visitors to then go over to your stuff and therefore follow you on social media and become an email subscriber on your email list and things like that. And so I think building those strategic partnerships of finding people who have similar or complementary audiences and finding ways to collaborate in one way is a huge way to not only increase the reach that you're getting and increase your audience, but also provide even more value to your audience because of the fact that you're bringing in someone that you deem to be an expert on whatever topic you're discussing.

[00:07:05.370] - Speaker 5
I totally agree.

[00:07:07.530] - Speaker 4
I also love doing partnership marketing strategies.

[00:07:13.550] - Speaker 5
For most of my clients. And I think another benefit of it.

[00:07:19.600] - Speaker 4
On top of everything you said, I totally agree. It also jumps you up with the trust factor because someone that they already trust has introduced you. So you're adding all of these warm people as opposed to a bunch of cold traffic.

[00:07:44.090] - Speaker 5
Ali, do you want to add anything?

[00:07:45.640] - Speaker 6
Madison well, I was trying to think of something like practical and so and I don't work in this all the time, so maybe Anne Marie can speak to this. But I had a client come to me that they had pitched a giveaway to a brand, and it's a pretty niche. It's in the woodworking space. So this brand, these tools were like, we'll do this giveaway with these eight different products. Can you promote it to your email list? And so my client got just cash revenue from that. It wasn't so much like, how much does that brand, send traffic back to my client. It's just like this is an opportunity for us to sell like a sponsorship, basically. And that is the package. And I think we ended up writing like six different emails promoting it. But like three of those were like tips and tools, using these kind of literal tools, tips and tricks, while also reminding people about completing the giveaway. So something like that, that you can pitch to any sponsor if there's a brand you really love. I mean, you can tell me if I'm wrong, Emory, if I'm like setting.

[00:08:47.000] - Speaker 3
Up, you're totally right. Yeah.

[00:08:49.890] - Speaker 6
Like find a sponsor that will pay you. I don't know, depending on the size of your list. I know because I feel like we need engagement because you want good engagement. I've also seen people using their newsletters and having a sponsorship section on there. And people can I've seen lists of 10,000 or more subscribers and they've got their open rates there and their kind of average click rate if you want to become a sponsor. And it's like $500 an email. And so you can kind of package it up in a few ways. It could be like newsletter sponsor, and that might be a little bit manual at first, but that's one way to make money, especially during high traffic seasons, right?

[00:09:31.470] - Speaker 4
And I mean, yes, it's manual, but the more you charge, the more manual process you're also willing to do. But I totally agree. And jumping off of what you said about listing your engagement rate and all of your stats there. I actually just saw somebody who had set up a page in Notion and it was like their highlights. It was particularly them to use for.

[00:09:59.590] - Speaker 6
I don't know if it was to.

[00:10:00.420] - Speaker 4
Be a speaker or to participate in a summit or something like that, but.

[00:10:04.350] - Speaker 5
It had some really great highlights for them.

[00:10:08.030] - Speaker 4
So it was like their audience size and some examples of content and video of them.

[00:10:13.360] - Speaker 5
So something like that, and then sending.

[00:10:15.960] - Speaker 4
It over to the brand that you're pitching for sponsorship.

[00:10:21.150] - Speaker 5
Just remembering the whole point of or.

[00:10:24.850] - Speaker 4
Something that's super helpful, I guess, is make it as easy on them as you possibly can so they can just.

[00:10:30.850] - Speaker 5
Say like, yes, and then you've gotten.

[00:10:35.240] - Speaker 4
Them reach and it's a win win all around. And sometimes going in with that frame.

[00:10:42.700] - Speaker 5
Of mind also makes it easier for.

[00:10:46.040] - Speaker 4
Me if I'm like, oh my gosh, I'm nervous, I focus on this is actually helpful.

[00:10:54.010] - Speaker 5
I'm giving them something that they need.

[00:10:56.910] - Speaker 6
Right, well, and there's like how you pitch it. And I think if you're like, oh, I could never just approach a brand. Yeah, you could. They would love to get in front of your niche audience that does gluten free baking. You know how many brands would just fight to get in front of your people? Like your 3000 people? Let me not fight. But you know how much money they would pay. Or you could offer like five newsletter spots for $1,000, start with something. And I don't work with influencer marketing. There are people who know how to negotiate those things. That is not me, but I've definitely.

[00:11:28.530] - Speaker 1
Seen this work for clients.

[00:11:31.490] - Speaker 3
I think the thing I would add to all of this is kind of going back to the question of how do you grow your traffic is I think you have to have a really solid content strategy and know where you want to go. I feel like it's so easy for people to say, oh, I just want to grow my traffic and I want to qualify for Ads, or I just want to have bigger numbers. But we have to think about, why do you want that? Yeah. Your first goal might be to qualify for Ads, but the type of traffic that you would need to qualify for Ads is kind of different than what you would need to work with a brand, because you might not need as much to work with a brand, but they're going to care about your engagement. They're going to care about what your website looks like. They're going to care about who your audience is. Whereas if you just need traffic and that's all you really care about, you're going to have a completely different content strategy approach because of the way that you're trying to bring that traffic to you.

[00:12:23.160] - Speaker 3
So I think it's really important to.

[00:12:25.210] - Speaker 5
Be clear about kind of what the.

[00:12:27.130] - Speaker 3
Intention is about why you're trying to grow to a certain level. And it's okay if you just want the ad revenue, but again, that's going to be a different approach and a different strategy to kind of grow at whatever rate you want to grow, to bring in enough traffic versus trying to build an audience to be able to go to a gluten free baking company and say, like, hey, I have 500 people who are ready and willing to buy your product if I put it in front of them. That's different than being like, yeah, I have a bunch of random people coming to my website every month and they might or might not come back, that type of thing. So it's important to have that distinction when you're trying some sort of content strategy because it's very different.

[00:13:08.290] - Speaker 2
Yeah, I just kind of want to add to that. Right, so if you want to make a full time living blogging from Ada, then yeah, you're going to need a ton of traffic. Right. But if you want to make a full time living offering one on one services, you don't need nearly as much. Or through digital products, 10,000 page views a month would be plenty. You don't need necessarily 100,000 page views to be full time self employed with an online business. It depends on how you want to pay yourself, basically kind of what those goals are, like you said, because if you're focusing on sort of ad revenue and really that content, that's going to be learning SEO really well, as opposed to connecting more with partners or brands or doing social media really well. And some social media has SEO aspects to it, and that's totally different. I will leave that to the experts of Ashley and Rita to kind of break those. It's really before you go chase. So this was a lesson I had to learn the hard way. Before you go chasing the success you see someone have, make sure you want that same kind of success because you could dive in, you could get successful and be miserable.

[00:14:19.220] - Speaker 2
And you're like, no, I don't actually like this. Why did I do this? I just wanted that level or whatever. Been there, done that myself. So no shame if that's where you're at either.

[00:14:29.530] - Speaker 6
Well, and it's not to say that.

[00:14:30.770] - Speaker 3
You can't do both of those things, right? These are just two examples. I just recorded a podcast episode sharing eight different ways to have eight different revenue streams you could have as a blogger, and you could have multiple of them. It's not like you just have to chase one, and you can do brand partnerships while you're trying to qualify for ads. But you just have to have an idea behind, why am I doing this and what is the goal here? Because you're going to need different data. You're going to approach a brand differently if you know your audience and things like that. So it's just important to have that strategy behind what you're doing.

[00:15:05.610] - Speaker 6
Yeah, I always tell new bloggers or like, new online business people, I'm like, don't buy anything for six months because we tend to think, like, I need to be on Pinterest. I'm like, you don't even know how to write a blog post. You don't even know how to use canva. There are all these things that before you could even be on Pinterest, you actually have to have a niche. And are you selling something? Do you have a service? Just allow yourself to kind of take it all in. And I think maybe we feel that also around big seasons like Q Four, but I should be creating a product and launching a product, but also running this or that or planning for the next year. So it's really just a matter of figuring out what strategy works for you, and you will have time to implement other strategies later. You do not have to do them.

[00:15:48.250] - Speaker 1
All at the same time.

[00:15:50.150] - Speaker 3
And you're not agreeing what works unless.

[00:15:52.210] - Speaker 2
You dedicate to one thing for a little bit.

[00:15:57.450] - Speaker 4
I think that pointing that out for Q Four is so important because I've caught myself doing it in the past of you see somebody doing a cool campaign or doing something in a way like you haven't seen before, and then immediately your brain is like, oh my God, should I be doing that? Is this the thing? And I know so many people that I've spoken with, they fall into that like, oh, if I just did that, everything would improve, everything would change, everything would do whatever.

[00:16:35.990] - Speaker 5
And it's like one strategy is not.

[00:16:42.090] - Speaker 4
Going to make or break you one season.

[00:16:46.790] - Speaker 2
Well, I guess depending on what season.

[00:16:48.620] - Speaker 4
Could, that is a long time. But if you miss out on doing.

[00:16:52.910] - Speaker 5
This one thing, you can come back from that.

[00:16:56.380] - Speaker 4
You can create another campaign.

[00:16:59.710] - Speaker 6
You don't have to create a product to sell for Black Friday. You don't have to, right? If you would rather I'm actually going to spend the season figuring out how to optimize my current content for SEO for the whole next year, do that, or I'm going to hire someone to help me do that. I know that it's not sexy and it's not necessarily going to generate sales in Q Four, but I've been in business for five years and a lot of it is just like rejecting the hustle and being like, but I'm building out something that I'm doing in December. It's okay that I'm not doing Black Friday because not only do you have to create the product, you should create the promo emails, you have to create a way for them to check out. That also depends on your business model. I'm a service provider, so if you're like, I need to create a product, then do it. And maybe that means you're going to wait to optimize content until January or you hire someone.

[00:17:53.790] - Speaker 3
Right?

[00:17:54.190] - Speaker 4
And especially for service providers, a lot.

[00:17:56.060] - Speaker 5
Of the time, Q One is much.

[00:17:58.840] - Speaker 4
Better and busier than Q Four is anyway. So think about where your best use.

[00:18:06.710] - Speaker 5
Of energy is going to be.

[00:18:09.890] - Speaker 4
Because if you're just going to race and try to figure out something for, like you said, like Black Friday Cyber.

[00:18:16.400] - Speaker 5
Monday, is that going to be the.

[00:18:20.330] - Speaker 4
Best use of your time? If it's going to bring in a ton of cash and that's what you want, fantastic.

[00:18:26.390] - Speaker 5
But for me, I've run specials like a few times in the past and.

[00:18:32.590] - Speaker 4
It'S been fine, but it's certainly never been anything wild.

[00:18:37.610] - Speaker 5
And if you want to grow that.

[00:18:40.750] - Speaker 4
And you want to put Ada behind it, it's SEO expensive, like in Q Four.

[00:18:46.750] - Speaker 5
So if the timing doesn't really matter to you wait.

[00:18:51.730] - Speaker 1
Yeah.

[00:18:55.230] - Speaker 2
Ashley looked like you wanted to say something. Or am I calling?

[00:18:57.970] - Speaker 7
Yeah, I was just going to say, I mean, in terms of the Black Friday Cyber Monday topic, it has me thinking, like, think about if your audience is more likely to buy during that. I know my ideal clients, they don't really care about buying my marketing services during a Black Friday Cyber Monday sale. Like, it's not relevant. And so I think often people kind of get that FOMO of seeing everyone else running Black Friday Cyber Monday sales and they think they need to jump on the train but honestly, it's such a saturated time of year that you really need to be doing something different than others within your industry to stand out. And so I think just kind of not getting caught up in that hamster wheel and being more strategic and thinking about if it matters to the people you're selling to, if you're going to offer something during that time, or if.

[00:19:40.860] - Speaker 5
They'Re just going to buy from you no matter what.

[00:19:43.650] - Speaker 6
I run like, big promos around my birthday in June. I'm like, you can find any time to run a promo.

[00:19:48.940] - Speaker 2
It does not have to be, that's me next month. Next month is my birthday. There will be promos going up.

[00:19:53.850] - Speaker 6
I heard someone once say, it's your birthday and you have every reason to celebrate. You should sell something.

[00:20:02.890] - Speaker 2
No, I'm calling him at my birthday. Bonanza month. Yeah. Just because Q Four is known across the board generally to be the best quarter doesn't mean it has to be your best quarter. Q Four was almost always I mean, the last couple of years I've actually done a little bit of effort and I'll earn a couple of grand from Black Friday. Nothing huge. My big quarter is almost always Q One because that's when the summit really takes place. So just, again, like they said, it's what makes sense for you. The seasons of your business aren't going to necessarily always match the kind of general rules out there would be kind of just my way of looking at that.

[00:20:51.430] - Speaker 6
Can I go rogue? Okay. Because I also don't want to squash people's dreams of launching something on Black Friday because it's also or like in this season or launching ever. So I feel like it might be helpful that if we're like, if you are doing something, here's how you can do it just like a little bit better. So for email marketing, people are like, well, I sent out one email for my Black Friday offer and I was like, only one? So if you're going to do Black Friday, just sell the heck out of it. Do it. Give them a reminder that it's expiring. Yeah, get that out there.

[00:21:25.330] - Speaker 2
We do have a Black Friday panel on Thursday.

[00:21:27.980] - Speaker 6
Oh, well then I'm not going to.

[00:21:29.440] - Speaker 3
Whatever.

[00:21:30.450] - Speaker 2
We'll take more into doing Black Friday Monetization on Thursday.

[00:21:35.570] - Speaker 3
Cool.

[00:21:36.300] - Speaker 2
Because I do feel like that's why I'm like, this could be a film panel.

[00:21:39.790] - Speaker 7
Yeah.

[00:21:40.330] - Speaker 6
The other thing is something that I've run into a lot with clients, like content creators, food bloggers, is that they're like, yeah, I have the same six or seven Thanksgiving recipes. Do I send them out again? And I was like, yes, you send it out every year. Like you capture that traffic whenever you can get it, you can also I've had a client who did like a twelve days of Thanksgiving or something and she sent out like a different recipe every day for twelve days and had people opt in for it. And so that way it's like an excuse to send out recipes and send traffic back to the site. But you can use content you already have. But I know there's a lot of mindset stuff around like but I've already sent that out before. I'm like, well, do your new people know about it? The email marketing, I work a ton in automations. You can't really automate seasonal content so when it is the season, send the email. Just like you can duplicate the email from the previous year. I would rather have you do that than not send an email out at all.

[00:22:38.560] - Speaker 6
And probably send more than one.

[00:22:40.730] - Speaker 7
Yeah, especially because people don't remember, so they likely won't remember if they saw the same exact recipe last year. And also if something performed well, you should be duplicating it SEO. If that email or whatever content is generating high engagement rates or high traffic, you want to keep doing that and want to keep imitating that success that you're getting.

[00:23:03.120] - Speaker 6
Yeah, and if it's a tried and true recipe, that makes it even better because more people can trust it.

[00:23:09.090] - Speaker 2
And each year I'll get more positive reviews and even better.

[00:23:14.790] - Speaker 6
And so in a way there's ways you could present it like is it a menu or are you going to separate it by potential breakfast and entrees and appetizers could be entirely separate emails. You can present it differently depending on how much content you have. But I wouldn't be afraid to send it out again even if it because as content creators were like, yeah, I wrote that three years ago. I'm like, okay, well, Betty who just joined your email list last month does not care and she wasn't here. Send her the dang potato recipe. Woman wants to make.

[00:23:46.910] - Speaker 1
Mean.

[00:23:47.440] - Speaker 4
As a user, I enjoy when I.

[00:23:50.290] - Speaker 5
Get things because my ADHD brain, I.

[00:23:54.320] - Speaker 4
Am popping away from something no matter how much I wanted to make it with this example which happens to me all the time.

[00:24:01.960] - Speaker 5
And then I'm like, I wanted to.

[00:24:04.010] - Speaker 4
Make that pie or whatever.

[00:24:08.230] - Speaker 5
And then if the person posts it.

[00:24:10.730] - Speaker 4
Again and I see it pop up in my feed, I'm like, thank God. Now I can go and do this, because I couldn't even remember the words.

[00:24:19.360] - Speaker 5
To Search for well, and I think.

[00:24:22.520] - Speaker 3
People are in they're in their inbox a lot more, but there's a lot more coming to them during quarter four. So even sending the same thing or using resending it to the unopened, those strategies are going to be really effective because there's just so much noise going on and so you have to kind of cut through the noise by being a little bit more. We get annoyed thinking like, oh, I just talked about that, I said that again. But our readers probably only saw it once even if we talked about it ten times. That's just the reality of how things work, social media, email, whatever it is, people are not seeing as much as we think they are. So we need to be obnoxiously loud about what we want them to do or see if we want them to actually see it and take action. And if it's valuable to them, then we should be excited to it's kind of like what Anne Marie was saying about working with brands. If you know that this is the best potato casserole recipe ever and they have to make it for, like, you're doing a disservice to them by not sharing it enough so that they see it.

[00:25:19.160] - Speaker 3
But just be mindful of the fact that there's a lot of other noise out there, so it's okay to do it a little bit more than you normally would.

[00:25:27.470] - Speaker 1
Okay.

[00:25:29.150] - Speaker 2
I want to move on a little bit because I think so Q Four is really a big time to be planning, whether you're planning out for Q One or you're planning out for monetizing Q Four or whatnot. And this is something I'm a very fly, by the seat in my pants marketing person, which is probably why I don't do it that well. But how do you kind of come up with and implement a marketing plan? Where do you start and how does that kind of evolve into what your marketing is?

[00:25:56.970] - Speaker 4
I start at the end.

[00:25:58.720] - Speaker 1
Oh, sorry. Go ahead.

[00:26:00.190] - Speaker 6
No, I was going to be sarcastic about like, well, if we all had that figured out, we would be millionaires. Everybody struggles with it in some way, so Anne Marie will have something more.

[00:26:08.430] - Speaker 4
Productive to I just I was just saying I like to start at the end, like, where do we want to be? And I think it's fair to look at kind of like our big goals, but then we kind of bring it back and say, okay, where do I.

[00:26:24.150] - Speaker 5
Want to be six months, three months from now? And then mapping out big things. So if I'm taking a month off.

[00:26:37.260] - Speaker 4
Or I'm doing something, we have to make sure that we're using that for planning ahead because we don't want to.

[00:26:44.180] - Speaker 5
Go dark for a month.

[00:26:45.740] - Speaker 4
We want to have things that are still going out.

[00:26:48.170] - Speaker 5
So if we're looking at content, we're going to want think I think it.

[00:26:53.560] - Speaker 4
Was Madison may have mentioned it before doubling up on certain weeks ahead so that we have things that are going out. But in terms of looking at our goal, I think that we need to be, like Ashley said, super intentional with what we're doing so that the quality is there and so that we're not burning ourselves or our team out. We don't need to be wasting resources.

[00:27:15.690] - Speaker 5
And we want to have fun at.

[00:27:18.390] - Speaker 4
The end of the day on our businesses and be successful. And we can't do that if we're constantly just run down and exhausted.

[00:27:28.930] - Speaker 1
Yeah.

[00:27:29.330] - Speaker 3
And sometimes people start, sorry, Ashley, you want to go.

[00:27:32.240] - Speaker 6
Ahead, go ahead.

[00:27:33.790] - Speaker 3
I was going to say, I think people start with like, okay, how much content do I want to create? Okay, I want to create like two to three posts a week. So that means I need 700 posts, whatever it is. But they forget that it's not just the creating of the post, it's everything else that comes after it too. Even if you don't do a ton of marketing. And something that I found with Food Bloggers specifically, is there's just so much content that you could create and share and promote and it becomes paralyzing almost. So for me, I would actually start with what are all of the steps that I have to take from start to finish when it comes to creating one piece of content? Like, I have to do the recipe development, I have to take the photos, I have to do this, I have to do this all the way to I'm going to share it on social media. Because once you have a clearer picture of like, there's ten steps for every blog post, that's going to make it a lot easier for you to say, like, okay, it's actually only sustainable for me.

[00:28:22.690] - Speaker 3
Create one really high quality post per week in quarter four because I have life going on. I've got school activities and holidays and all this stuff. But again, I think our brain first goes like, how much can I possibly cram in? And then you're going to get halfway through October and be like, all right, white flag, I'm out. This is not working. I'm just going to call it quits for the rest of the quarter. So I think being really mindful of the whole picture with your life included, not just business wise, is going to help it be a lot more sustainable when you're planning. And that works the same for quarter one, because I think, again, people are like, all right, I'm going to hit the ground running in January. Well, the first two weeks of January, we're all like half asleep, mostly because of the holidays. So take that in mind and get ahead for that too. So I think just like the Holistic view is so important when it comes to planning. And again, like, taking a piece of the content strategy and putting that in there too, is the only way that you're going to make it through quarter four without complete burnout, which I think we've all agreed is the goal here.

[00:29:21.580] - Speaker 7
Yeah, I think going off of both what you said Madison and Anne Marie is when thinking of your marketing plan and marketing strategy, think of your end goal and then reverse engineer that. So if you want to make a certain revenue per month, then you have to think about, okay, how many clients do I have to have each month in order to reach that monthly revenue? Once you know that, what do I need to do marketing wise to actually find those clients to reach that monthly revenue, and you can kind of break it down into smaller actionable steps from there. And then I think that will help to guide you intentionally with creating a marketing plan and also being really mindful and aware of the things that you are doing, of whether or not they will get you closer to that lead generation strategy, an approach that you're taking to get more clients in that aspect. And so that's kind of like how I like to start exactly like you said, Anne Marie. Start with the end and think about what it is that you want to achieve and then work your way backward and say, what exactly do I need to do from a marketing standpoint to reach that goal and ensure that everything you do is with intention and you're putting the quality that you can into it to help you reach those goals.

[00:30:27.790] - Speaker 1
Yeah.

[00:30:28.190] - Speaker 2
And I just want to say, if you guys want to kind of those watching want to dig deeper, amanda Warfield's session I know talks about kind of planning your year with kind of your life in mind. And Kara Harvey's session also goes into really well, breaking down all the steps needed to do each thing to help you really kind of realistically create a plan. So I would just say be sure to watch those sessions. Yes.

[00:30:51.030] - Speaker 6
Ali let me add it now that I'm done being sassy and everybody gave such great, right. I'm a service provider. I'm not a full time content creator, so I have to find time to create my content. And since I have a bit of a different approach, if anybody just wants to steal it, go for it. But basically, I have, like, a content bank of ideas, and I kind of filter them into different categories. Like, one is writing about the technical side of email or platforms or email storytelling or maybe a podcast I've been on. I kind of create these buckets. And so that's great because it's basically like a brain dump. You're like, oh, yeah, this is like pieces of assets I can create. I typically write my email and then it becomes a blog post, which I know is the opposite of a lot of other people. However, I'm also incorporating brand new blog posts that were never emails into emails. So I'm trying to figure that out. But basically having this content bank, what is helpful for me is just like, what are the next four that I need to write? Just narrow it down so that I don't feel like I have this year ahead of me of all this content I need to create what's next?

[00:32:01.630] - Speaker 6
And then just building it into my schedule. When I work on those things, instead.

[00:32:08.110] - Speaker 1
Of necessarily like, I don't know, I'm.

[00:32:11.170] - Speaker 6
Going to go just go create a ton of content, like batching not my style. I would rather every week have a habit of this is what needs to be written, and it's done. It does a couple of things. It keeps me really in the loop with what's going on currently in email marketing. If this platform is launching something and I can tell my list about it or there's a summit coming up, I can be a little bit more flexible with telling them those things. But, yeah, something about my end goal isn't, like, a number of blog posts or whatnot. It's just like, what does it look like to be consistent? And what do I need time wise to be able to create the content, feel good about it, give it to my assistant and have her send it out, and then we repurpose that. Those emails that can be repurposed, that are not seasonal become part of my nurture sequence. They become part of a blog post. But I think the most important thing is on my schedule, the goal is consistency, and I don't really have an end goal. My emails are not going to make me a certain amount of money or the number of blog posts I have are not going to make me a certain amount of money.

[00:33:12.660] - Speaker 6
But it gives me the time and space to develop my own intellectual property and originality. Just like you would with a recipe. A brand new recipe. If you're a food blogger.

[00:33:23.510] - Speaker 1
I hope that's helped. Okay.

[00:33:27.850] - Speaker 2
Yes, I like that. Okay, taking it back a little bit to what we're talking about at the beginning and collaborating to grow and market. First of all, I want to kind of just put this in people's heads of, like, if you're like, that doesn't really click with me. Concerts. There's an opening act, right? I saw Lady Gaga when she opened for New Kids on the Block. I saw Ed Sheeran. Well, I've seen him multiple times, but I saw him when he opened for Swift, right? Like, you wouldn't think of them as openers, but they started there, right? They borrowed those audiences and grew their own. So just kind of in a real world, non online businessy sense, that's kind of what you're doing. But how do you go about I mean, obviously, if there's brands you love reaching out for sponsorships and partnerships and stuff, but how do you otherwise like, content wise collaborators, how do you go about finding them? What are some suggestions you guys have?

[00:34:23.210] - Speaker 7
So I can share an example of something that I just recently did as my passion project. As head of my agency, I run this local publication called Massachusetts Business Network, which supports businesses across the state. And so a lot of what we do is guest blogging people coming in to guest blog for us or content collaboration in that aspect. And so one thing I started doing was this monthly blog series called Boss in the Bay State, where we feature just business owners throughout the state who are doing cool things. And so in my town. Recently, they opened up a local ice cream shop that is all the rave right now. It's delicious. And their Facebook page gets a ton of traction. So me, kind of selfishly. First of all, I love the ice cream, but selfishly, I was like, they're getting a lot of traction on their Facebook page. I want to take advantage of that and see how I can benefit from that. And so I reached out to the owner to say, like, hey, we'd love to feature you in our August Boss in the Base Date series. We'd love to interview you.

[00:35:21.330] - Speaker 7
And she was so excited. And so we published her interview last week, and it was a super easy form that she just filled out. She sent in a photo. I published it on her blog. She shared it on her Facebook page, and she had almost like 300 reactions to the post, plus I think it was like 50 shares of that post. So I was able to kind of tap into her audience to get traffic to my website, which then ended up kind of driving people over that way. And so that's been really helpful, I think, just like, making it easy to collaborate, like finding people who have that audience that is similar to yours, but also making it easy to do something like Anne Marie. You mentioned that earlier. Making it easy for people to say yes. I mean, it took her five minutes to fill out that form and send over a photo, and then boom, I got a bunch of traction from it. So I think it's as simple as finding a way to mutually benefit people and then you can come up with an idea from there.

[00:36:17.550] - Speaker 6
Yeah, I've done a list swap with people. I have an educational email that I.

[00:36:22.870] - Speaker 1
Wrote three years ago.

[00:36:24.850] - Speaker 6
It's like five things. Like, five reasons why you need email marketing, and at the end, like, link over to one of my free resources. And so I just have a Google Doc that's view only. And so if I run into people that I'm like, well, we might not be a good fit for you to be a sponsor. I don't know, trying to find a reason or just like, I will reach out to. I recently did a list swap with a Pinterest company because email and Pinterest are both like traffic and getting traffic and building familiarity and all of that, or like, how they partner together. So she and I did a swap. So I was like, here's the link to the email that you could send out to your list. She's like, I love it. Let me write one for you. And we did. And so you can use a specific URL if you want to track how many people came in through that link. But I've seen a lot of really great success with that. You have to be strategic about who you're pitching that to. I don't need to pitch it to other email marketing strategists.

[00:37:16.600] - Speaker 6
I want to pitch it to people who are tangentially related. I also don't need my blogging clients sending it out to their list. That would make no sense. People who are reading food blogs don't need email marketing unless they are also a food blogger. So yeah, that's been pretty helpful. And I've just had the one email, I never had to recreate one.

[00:37:36.490] - Speaker 4
Yeah, and if that's part of your strategy at any point in the year, you can also look for there's like.

[00:37:42.990] - Speaker 5
Different memberships and things like that to get collaboration.

[00:37:50.670] - Speaker 4
I was just in one like the Collab Club and there's different ones like that or there's Facebook groups so that you can get connected with people who are also looking to collaborate. You can have coffee, chats, you can do whatever. Make sure that your audiences are a good fit for each other so that you said it can be mutually beneficial, but it makes it a little bit easier than just cold messaging somebody because, you know, every single person is there because they are open to collaboration and they're excited about collaborating.

[00:38:28.250] - Speaker 2
I would say don't be afraid to cold pitch though, but be personable. Don't make it like a super generic. I cold pitch all the time, especially for the summit. But I don't just be like, oh, I liked your most recent block, I do a little digging. I make sure that they would potentially be a good fit, that my summit would be a good fit for them and I personalize them and say, hey, I think you would be great to talk about this to this audience.

[00:38:55.000] - Speaker 1
Right?

[00:38:55.190] - Speaker 2
Because I do, you know, I really like that you're doing this or hey, I noticed you're in the middle of a, you know, take your time, whatever. I'll follow be, be a person. As Kate Doster says. Be a human, treat people like and so don't be afraid to cold pitch. You'll be surprised how successful you can be with it if you're actually a person and not just spamming.

[00:39:20.890] - Speaker 6
Yeah, like I'll pitch to be on podcasts, but there's only so much control you have over being on podcasts. Or when they go live, you might record one this week and it comes out in two weeks or it will come out in January. So that's another one of those just habit building type tasks. You're like, I'm constantly pitching, but the end result you don't really have a lot of control over.

[00:39:45.010] - Speaker 5
But that actually brings up the idea.

[00:39:47.990] - Speaker 3
Of podcasting as a method of collaboration. You don't have to be a podcast and I think for so most of us have said we're already like service providers of some kind. But outside of the service industry, if you are a blogger, there are podcasts about your niche where you could come on as an expert and talk about it. You're going to get a backlink, which is going to be helpful for SEO. You're going to get to craft your own intellectual property and authority and expertise and stuff like that. And then you're also going to be able to borrow their audience through when they share about their podcast episode with you. So I feel like that's a very underutilized strategy for bloggers because people, I don't know if it's that they think, well, I write, I don't speak, but we all have a voice that we can share and it's okay if it's rough and it's okay if you've never done it before. As a podcast, I can tell you when you have a great topic that I can't speak on myself, like email marketing, for example, I'm going to find somebody who can come and speak about that.

[00:40:47.380] - Speaker 3
And so if you reach out to somebody who has a podcast with a genuine pitch of like, hey, I love this episode of your podcast, just like Liz was saying, and I think I'd be able to talk on this topic to your audience. I mean, sure, you might get no response or it might be not a good fit, but if they do interviews and you have a good topic, there's a really good chance that it will work know for other bloggers. There's also like blogging specific podcasts where people bring on bloggers to share their story and to share what they've learned. So that's an option too. But it's a very good way to extend your reach and get really good at talking about what it is that you do.

[00:41:26.770] - Speaker 5
I feel like there's a lot of.

[00:41:27.910] - Speaker 3
Crossover in industries too. It doesn't have to be specific to food or blogging. You could go on a mom podcast and talk about meal planning and that could be your way of talking about your blog. So there's a lot of different ways to make that work.

[00:41:43.190] - Speaker 6
And I think just the same way we talked about sponsorship, like pitching sponsors or list swaps or being on podcast, the important thing we're all marketers here, so maybe we just naturally think about this is like, you have to make the pitch about the person and their audience, like how it benefits them. Because if you're like, hey, I have this great story, don't you want to hear it? They'd be like, I don't know, who are you? And it's like, hey, for instance, I had a client tell me on our discovery call. She was like, yeah, I decided to niche down and my website went up like four times, like the traffic. And I was like, you need to be telling people about this. And she's just like, to her, she's just like, oh, it's just like my story. And I was like, we need to get you on the food blogger Pro podcast because there are a lot of people out there wondering about whether they should niche down or not and if it would be beneficial to them. And it's like, by you telling your story, you can encourage them. So in the pitch, it's not just.

[00:42:35.550] - Speaker 1
Like, oh, hey, I did this.

[00:42:37.370] - Speaker 6
Wasn't it cool? It's like, hey, would this be helpful for your audience to also see another way of being a content creator in a way that's been really beneficial for.

[00:42:44.270] - Speaker 1
Me and as a podcast host, Madison.

[00:42:46.900] - Speaker 6
You'D probably be like, yeah, because it could impact my listeners. That's what they're looking for. Just like, I'm not going to take on a sponsor that doesn't care about or wouldn't be speaking to the people on my email list or do a list swap for people that has nothing to do with what I talk about, or they would present it in a completely different way. Like, I'm kind of gatekeeping, right? So that's what Madison's job is as a podcast. She's she's savoring the time that she has with her listeners and doesn't want.

[00:43:14.580] - Speaker 1
To just send them anything for sure.

[00:43:17.590] - Speaker 6
And that's going to be the same.

[00:43:18.630] - Speaker 3
Regardless of what platform it is. Whether it's you're trying to do an Instagram swap or an email list swap, like, whatever it is, it's got to be about the connection and how you can bring something of value to that audience. But nine times out of ten, if you have something of value you can bring, they're probably going to say yes. And if they don't say yes, it's probably because they don't accept that in general or it's just not a good timing fit. But either way, it's really likely that you can make something work, especially if you come and you're like, hey, I have three ideas for a way that we could collaborate. Like, which one sounds best to you? That is going to be so much more approachable than these really cold pitches that we get from businesses where it's like, do you even know what I do? I don't even think you really just scrape information. Exactly. So make that note.

[00:44:01.740] - Speaker 2
You'll be good to go. See if they have guidelines for pitching. Check to see if they have guidelines for pitching. Right. SEO. I have a couple of blogs where I accept guest posts, but I won't even respond to guest posts if it isn't aligned with the requirements for a pitch of a guest post. So do your homework. Be personable. See if there's guidelines because that'll go a long way as well. Sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt what you said. Okay, we do need to start wrapping up. There is a question in the chat I want to make sure we touch on. So Margaret wants to know how do you calculate the rate for a brand ad on your site? And obviously this depends on the situation, but where would you start in trying to figure that out? I guess would be a good and again, I know this group is marketers. Not necessarily like working with brand sponsorships type of thing, but just any thoughts you have on that because I don't want to leave her hanging.

[00:44:57.330] - Speaker 4
Do your competitor research.

[00:44:59.300] - Speaker 5
See what other similarly sized in your.

[00:45:04.880] - Speaker 4
Industry people are charging.

[00:45:07.490] - Speaker 5
And I don't mean go over and.

[00:45:10.520] - Speaker 4
Copy exactly what they have or just.

[00:45:12.840] - Speaker 3
To get a range.

[00:45:14.730] - Speaker 4
I kind of look at it similarly like you would if you were going to a corporate job or something. Look at what other people are offering and make sure you're in the same range.

[00:45:26.350] - Speaker 5
I don't recommend trying to underbid or.

[00:45:30.230] - Speaker 4
Anything like that because it's just going.

[00:45:33.350] - Speaker 5
To hurt the industry.

[00:45:34.970] - Speaker 4
In general, you want to keep your prices kind of in line with what.

[00:45:38.390] - Speaker 5
Everybody else is doing and then just make sure that your stats also line.

[00:45:44.780] - Speaker 4
Up so that it makes sense.

[00:45:47.350] - Speaker 6
Where do you find that information, Anne Marie? Are there other people's media kits available on their website?

[00:45:52.440] - Speaker 4
Yeah, that's where I would start for.

[00:45:59.690] - Speaker 5
Yeah, that's probably where I would go, is media kits.

[00:46:03.300] - Speaker 3
But something I'll mention too, because we're talking about Q Four. It's probably not the best time during Q Four to reach out for a brand about a Q Four sponsorship. So you have to kind of be mindful about the timing of this stuff. Or even if you're trying to do Q One, don't email them Thanksgiving week. So be really mindful of just the chaos of this season and you can prepare stuff and get ready.

[00:46:25.320] - Speaker 5
But I just wouldn't do a huge.

[00:46:27.890] - Speaker 3
Blast of trying to get a brand partnership for December. Although with that said, if it's a brand you already have a connection with, you might have a better time. And sometimes there's like a leftover budget that you can scrape up. But in general, if you've never made a connection with the brand before, don't try to reach out to them and be like, I have an opening October 15. How's that sound? They're going to be like, we're booked. We've been booked since May. So just keep that in mind and be mindful of the timing with it.

[00:46:57.370] - Speaker 6
Go ahead. I was going to say, or just be mindful of that. That might be the response you get. And then ask them, when would be a better time, or can I reach out January? I will say as a service provider, I'm sure you guys get this too. Follow up is key. You can't just send one email either. Everybody's like, that's how you get the deal. And it's okay to be like, hey, I know it's been a busy season. I'm going to reach out in January. But if you have any thoughts in the meantime, let me know. Yeah, just liberate on and be personal about it.

[00:47:28.150] - Speaker 2
And I would say the bigger the corporation that you're wanting to work with, the further out you need to go. Because I think I reached out to a company at one point and I don't know, probably this time of year, and they're like, we're already in March. Of next year, right? The bigger, the further out you've got to pitch and follow up. So just kind of keeping that in mind and then trying to, like we've said, make it easy, make it recognize the season. So, like, the summit happens in January, but I always try to get all the promo materials to everyone by December 1 because I expect them to not want to work the second half of December and possibly not the first week of January, so they can just get it scheduled. Just being kind of mindful of that. Okay. And then I think we wanted unless anyone wanted to add to that in terms of figuring out calculating ad spend. I think Madison has some tips on how to prep your website for Q Four.

[00:48:28.490] - Speaker 3
Yeah, so I have seen this so many times where people have these big traffic days, even before a big holiday like Thanksgiving, but you see this big spike in traffic and you go to your website and you're like, oh my gosh, it's not right. Something's broken. My email, my opt in isn't working. So before the craziness really hits, we basically have like six weeks until Q Four starts. Do a really thorough review of what is happening on your website. And to do that, all you need to do is just open it on an incognito browser or on your phone on like, a private browser, preferably on your phone because most of your people are coming on your phone. If you're like a content creator, but just kind of have a fresh look at your website and see what is working or what is not working. Look for things that are broken or they're not easy to use. I actually really love enlisting somebody else to do this for you and looking over their shoulder. If you have a grandmother or even a parent who's not as tech savvy, my mom is in the other room.

[00:49:28.290] - Speaker 3
So I'm saying that really quietly, but get them to do it and say, hey, can you find my recipe index? And see what they do. Because sometimes they look for things in such a strange way that you're like, wow, I thought that was so intuitive to find. And it's actually really hard to find. Or like, hey, search for blah, blah, blah. And they're going to be like, where's your search bar? And you're like, I don't have a search bar on my website. So there's some things that you might not have even thought of. And when you can have somebody else kind of run through your site for you, it can be really helpful to find those little things. But then we've talked a lot about generating more traffic and bringing people to your site and doing marketing. Make sure you have a way to convert them to whatever it is that you want them to do. I think most of us are going to say email marketing. Like, get them on your email list. I would say that too. Get them on your email list. So make sure you have really obvious opt in forms on your website.

[00:50:21.840] - Speaker 3
If that's the one thing you walk away after you review your website and fix that part, that's going to be so key because you're going to have a huge influx of new people. And if you are not clear on what your site is about and who it's for and how you can serve your reader and you don't give them a way to figuratively and literally raise their hand to be a part of your audience, it's a missed opportunity completely. So those are kind of my quick and dirty tips for your website, is make sure nothing is really obviously broken and then make sure that you're optimizing for that email list SEO that you can capture that big traffic boost that you hopefully will have in Q four.

[00:50:58.090] - Speaker 6
And then with testing your forms this is how I do it when I go through and I audit somebody's, all their forms on their site. So if you have a Gmail account, I think it works for any, but I'll do like Ally plus Footer at Duet Co. So the email still goes to Ali at Duet Co because it's kind of like an alias. But then when you go inside of ConvertKit or Mailerlite or wherever, you can actually make sure it's connected to the right form. And then you can go sit in your inbox and make sure you get the email that was sent to Ali plus Footer at Duet Co. And if not, you're like, it's broken, let's try again. But otherwise, if you're just testing with the same Elon drives over and over again, you won't know which forms are broken.

[00:51:38.150] - Speaker 2
I love that it's not any email. It is a.

[00:51:44.630] - Speaker 3
Google domain works for that, too.

[00:51:46.840] - Speaker 2
Yeah, Google workspace because obviously your domain. So I do that too. I do like Elizabeth plus test one, two, three. If I'm just testing things and then when it doesn't work, I'm like, test 1234, test 17 tests.

[00:52:01.310] - Speaker 6
Really?

[00:52:03.230] - Speaker 1
Yeah.

[00:52:05.710] - Speaker 2
But I also wanted to say if you're maybe a newer blogger and maybe people in your life don't know about your blog yet and you're a little shy to tell them or to ask them to kind of go play around with it. I think it's called User Bob. For like $20, you can get 20 people to go do one thing on your site, like a 1 minute video, and tell you kind of if it makes sense or not. So that's an option as well. If you don't have someone to kind of be like, can you go SEO if you can do this right? Because maybe you're a little shy about your blog still, and that's okay.

[00:52:36.070] - Speaker 1
Yeah.

[00:52:36.410] - Speaker 3
And if you do end up finding a big list or even a small list of things, don't wait until the week of Thanksgiving to. Try to get it fixed. Another big thing I see with food bloggers specifically is like, your hosting isn't big enough to handle a spike in traffic. And the good hosts are really good about like, they're not going to shut your website down. But I have seen that happen to people on Thanksgiving. They're having this huge boost of traffic and their hosting is like, no, you don't have enough storage for this and they shut you down. So check with your hosting company ahead of time. Like, hey, if I see an increase in traffic, what's my threshold? What's my next tier? Or see if they'll let you just go ahead and approve it because you do not want that happening for lots and lots of reasons. So just, again, like we've said a couple of times, thinking ahead, planning ahead for these things is going to be so important so that you don't end up in a really bad situation or you're like at Thanksgiving dinner trying to check your website to make sure it's working correctly.

[00:53:32.170] - Speaker 2
It'll inevitably happen when you're away from your computer, for sure. Speaking from experience. Okay, any final words from everybody? If you guys just want to kind of go around and final words.

[00:53:46.510] - Speaker 7
I think for me, I would just, again, probably repeat what I mentioned at the beginning, which is quality over quantity. Always think about producing any type of content or marketing strategy that always aims to educate and provide value to your audience. And so even if that means dwindling down on the number of new content pieces that you're publishing, to do that, I always say it's better to ensure that you're showing up and being that thought leadership in some way than just generating content.

[00:54:14.480] - Speaker 3
Just to generate content.

[00:54:18.010] - Speaker 1
Yeah.

[00:54:18.410] - Speaker 4
And jumping off of that, I think that remembering that you create high quality content and you can use it again. So repurpose it, put it, use it, go from a blog to an email, or an email to a blog, create all the different social posts, make audio versions, create a video to go with it. There's so many different things that you.

[00:54:41.490] - Speaker 5
Can do and after some time has.

[00:54:44.370] - Speaker 4
Gone by, just send it out the same way you sent it out the first time. Ideally, you have a lot of new people and so you need to introduce yourself again.

[00:54:56.710] - Speaker 6
For me, I would say just make sure you're capturing that traffic when it's on your site. Get them onto your email list so that they can build a relationship with.

[00:55:04.490] - Speaker 1
You the rest of the years and the time to come.

[00:55:07.370] - Speaker 6
So whether it looks like a pop up on your desktop or using Spotlight subscribe in your blog posts, if you're a grow user, yeah, definitely this would be a great time to offer some sort of holiday specific freebie and really capture some of that traffic as long term subscribers know.

[00:55:28.110] - Speaker 3
Yeah, I think the biggest thing when I think about quarter four is just that planning aspect and building in margin for yourself because it has happened too many times where the whole quarter four is just so stressful. And in quarter one, it's like you're in recovery mode. So think ahead. Block out what it is that you want to take off what you want your life to look like, and then let your business fit in around that. Because, yes, it's a big quarter. Quarter four is amazing. There's lots of possibilities for it, but you don't have to kill yourself in the process in trying to create this amazing Q four to then just be recovering the rest of the year. So give yourself margin so that when you have an awesome marketing idea, you can run with it because you have the space and margin to do it, rather than being completely strapped for time throughout the entire quarter and just being.

[00:56:14.450] - Speaker 5
So drained by the end of it.

[00:56:17.310] - Speaker 1
Awesome.

[00:56:18.100] - Speaker 2
