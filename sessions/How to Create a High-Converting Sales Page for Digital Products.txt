Hi. I am so excited to be a part of the Blogger Breakthrough Summit and that I get the opportunity to share with you my best tips and methods of creating a high converting sales page. When I talk about creating a high converting sales page, I am referring to a sales page for digital products. Are you familiar with digital products? Digital products are a huge, untapped market online, and my goal for this training is to help you get one step closer to creating a new, profitable revenue stream.

[00:00:42.280] - Monica
With the tips I share with you on how to create a high converting sales page. My name is Monica Froese and I run two websites. The first is Redefining Mom, which is a site dedicated to helping moms thrive in both motherhood and business. And the second is Empowered Business, where I empower women to achieve financial freedom through creating six figure digital product businesses. Are you ready to get started? So before we dive in, let's make sure that we are on the same page and define exactly what a digital product is.

[00:01:11.890] - Monica
A digital product is an asset that you create, ones that you can sell over and over again. It's highly profitable because the majority of the work is done one time. Examples of this would be ebooks spreadsheets, printables website templates or digital courses. A digital product is simply a solution to someone's problem. Now to understand why, how and why I am sharing with you my tips on creating high converting sales pages.

[00:01:37.030] - Monica
I think it's important to know, first, who the heck am I? And two, why should you listen and take my advice on creating a sales page? So, let me tell you a little bit about me and my experience with digital products. I started creating digital products in 2016, and the very first product I created was the family budget spreadsheet. I had been blogging on Redefining Mom at the time for about three years and not making much money.

[00:02:02.980] - Monica
I was just too busy at my corporate job to spend time monetizing, but I still had some really cool opportunities, like going on Fox News and being invited to the White House to meet President Obama. I finally decided to quit my corporate job in 2016 and focus on my online and digital product business. Now, right around that time, I started somewhat of a movement, a new way to sell digital products that no one else was doing, and it's become pretty popular in my online business circles. I began teaching my students about the triple dip funnel, and now I click on digital product sales pages from places like Facebook ads and Pinterest ads.

[00:02:37.960] - Monica
And I get to see my brainchild come to life.

[00:02:40.140] - Monica
And it's pretty amazing. Now, before I get ahead of myself here, you might be completely lost about all this talk about sales funnels. So, let's take some time to define a few important terms so that you don't get overwhelmed. As I explain how the triple funnel can help you to sell more digital products. I want to make sure we are on the same page.

[00:03:00.270] - Monica
Okay. So, let's talk about a sales funnel at each step of the funnel, you're going to lose people because not everyone will take the next step in the funnel process. Sales funnel is just a simple way for referring to the buying journey. It's how you get someone from point A to point B. So, let's think about this in terms of how a traditional brick and mortar business works.

[00:03:25.080] - Monica
Yes, even traditional brick and mortar businesses have a sales funnel. Now, in this example, I'm going to talk about the new bike that I recently bought. The sales funnel process is a five step process. So, on top of the funnel is step one the problem. Now, here's what the problem was.

[00:03:42.490] - Monica
In this scenario, our family likes to go on bike rides and my mountain bike was super uncomfortable. I had to stay hunched over the handlebars, my neck aches. My butt hurt for days. Since I'm so uncomfortable, I never want to take bike rides with my kids.

[00:03:56.450] - Monica
I was telling a friend about this problem and she suggested that I go to a local bike shop to see what options they had for me. So, step two of the sales funnel process is research. Now, in the old days, I would have taken out a handy phone book and started calling around to different bike shops. But since it's the 21st century, I did a quick Google search and found a bike shop right around the corner from my house. Now step three is the solution.

[00:04:21.780] - Monica
At the bike shop, I started browsing the different bike options and landed on what they call a gazelle bike. It seems like it would solve all of the complaints I had with my current bike, but I wasn't quite sure. So that leads us to step four of the sales funnel process, the education. A nice employee named Mike educates me on the features of the gazelle bike. I learn how the handlebars are set to keep me upright while I ride and how the seats are much more comfortable than my mountain bike.

[00:04:47.140] - Monica
And then step five is the sale. Mike sold me with his expert knowledge and I am now the proud owner of a gazelle bike and plan to return soon to buy my daughter a new bike as well. So, the end result is this. At each step of this process, I needed to be convinced to take the next step. My friend told me that there were better bike options.

[00:05:08.060] - Monica
Google told me that there was a bike shop near my house. The bike shop had hundreds of bikes to choose from. Mike was knowledgeable and addressed all my concerns. I decided to buy a bike from Mike at the local bike shop. Now in online marketing, the process of convincing someone to take an action is known as a conversion.

[00:05:24.890] - Monica
If you end with the sale, what happens is you earned a conversion, you earn that sale. So, not everyone who has the problem that you're trying to solve with your digital product is going to end up buying from you. And that is why a sales funnel is simply an upside down triangle. Now, while I was finally starting to make money with my digital products, I started to realize a lot about running a profitable digital product business and the tricks and techniques I use on my sales pages that seem to do better than others.

[00:05:54.480] - Monica
So, over the years, I took notes of all the details that converted versus what didn't and came up with a very unique sales funnel called the Triple Dip Funnel.

[00:06:03.830] - Monica
Now, the Triple Dip funnel is a three part sales funnel that attracts cold traffic. In other words, people who don't know you to a sales page and offers two options to buy. It offers two options which you either buy or you sign up for freebie at the end. Okay, so it's a sales page. The objective is buy from me, but if they don't, they can sign up for a freebie at the end.

[00:06:27.740] - Monica
So that's two parts of the funnel. The third part of the funnel is if they opt in for the freebie at the end, they are taken to a triple dip page, which is a limited time offer. So why is this so powerful? Well, it's powerful because you have the ability to use your sales page to educate your potential customers by producing a lot of different types of elements on that page that are interactive and educational and inspirational all at the same time. So that's what we're going to talk about today.

[00:07:02.130] - Monica
There are 13 critical components to include on the Triple Dip sales page that are proven to increase your sales page conversions. In other words, make more money. Are you ready to hear them?

[00:07:20.050] - Monica
Number one, a catchy hook. On top of the sales page, you're going to actually state what the problem is and what you're selling. You're going to want to have a catchy tagline for the product. Number two, high quality product images. There are six ways to inspire action through product images, and I'm going to walk through those real quick.

[00:07:40.940] - Monica
The first one is high quality photos. Photos should be high resolution and professional. This alone will help you stand above others, especially photos that are unique to your brand and not stock photos. The second way to inspire action through your product images is to show real life solutions. And what I mean by this is show your product being used in real life.

[00:08:02.940] - Monica
Even if it's a digital product, it's something that is being used. One of the ways I do this is I do a photo shoot every year with a local photographer where I'm on my computer using my digital assets, and she's taking pictures of that. Now the third way to inspire action through product images is flat lays. Flat lays are a great way to showcase digital products. I get all my digital assets printed and I have my photographer take flat lays for me and I style them with on brand colored confetti notebook staplers.

[00:08:31.120] - Monica
It depends what your digital product is, but let's say that you have a meal planner that you sell. You can print out the meal planner, bind it at something like, at a place like Office Max and then display it, put it on your kitchen counter and have all the different things that you use for meal planning around that to take pictures. You can even do this with your Iphone. Now the fourth way to inspire action through product images is mockups. Mockups are a great way to showcase your solution.

[00:08:59.090] - Monica
Think of things like 3D covers for an ebook, or you could even if you sell something like a spreadsheet, you could use an imac display and insert a screenshot of the spreadsheet into it. That's called the product mockup, and that's something you can make online. Now the fifth way to inspire action through product images is to use compelling text overlays. Text overlays are a great way to communicate what your solution is about. So, if you have multiple components to your product, you can actually label what they are for.

[00:09:29.550] - Monica
So, for example, with my family budget system, there is a debt pay off spreadsheet, a family budget spreadsheet. There's a principal pack, principal cash envelopes, and I use text overlays in the image and that goes above the fold. And it's a way to demonstrate that there are multiple items inside of the system. Now the 6th way to inspire action through product images is to use gifs. Gifs are moving images.

[00:09:57.450] - Monica
So, for example, if you're selling an ebook, you could show the pages flipping. I've taken flat layers that I've created and made a gif image from them. It rotates through the different images and each image shows a different feature of the product. Okay, number three is ask a compelling question. So, asking compelling questions that will get your visitors mind thinking about why they need this product. This is where you want to put yourself in the shoes of your customer and think about the problem that they are facing for launching into what your product is actually about.

[00:10:32.810] - Monica
So ,for example, here's what I say on the Family Budget Spreadsheet sales page. I ask questions like, do you know how much money you have left after each paycheck? Six or even twelve months from now? Do you spend less than 30 minutes a month paying your bills and working on your budget? Do you know where you stand financially, where when an unexpected expense happens?

[00:10:54.820] - Monica
Or do you have a plan to get out of debt? And then I say, if you answered no to any of these questions, the family budget spreadsheet can help you. So, what you're doing is you're setting the frame of mind for them to understand where they're at and that you have something that's going to help them solve what that problem is. Number four is relevant customer testimonials. 

[00:11:17.030] 
So, customer testimonials are a great fit for showing that other people are happy with your product, but they can also be used to highlight the most important benefit of your product. The first customer testimonial should touch on the number one pinpoint that your problem solves and really draw that out. Your most compelling testimonials should stand on its own and be pretty high up on the sales page. Number five, relate to the customer. In this section, you're going to connect with your customers struggle. They might be frustrated, overwhelmed, sad.

[00:11:49.090] - Monica
You need to understand their emotions. Talk to them as you would a friend and let them know that you understand what their pain point is and let them know that they deserve a solution. And of course, the solution is going to be to buy your product. Number six, what's inside your product? Demonstrate what the product is in video format.

[00:12:11.120] - Monica
You can also take that video and put it on YouTube and link it to your sales page. So, for example, with the family budget spreadsheet, the video walks through each tab and has a text overlay showing the benefits of each tab and what each tab does. The video demonstrates how the spreadsheet benefits you, and there's music playing in the background. Of course, there are fun transitions and pictures added in. But if this scares you and you're like, I have no idea how to create a video.

[00:12:36.560] - Monica
Yeah, me neither. My first video was created by someone on Upwork. Underneath this section of what's inside, I recommend putting your very first buy button for the product. Number seven is key benefits. Now let's move into the key benefits of buying the product.

[00:12:57.150] - Monica
This is a good place to put 'imagine if' statements. So imagine if you could pay off your student loans because you've finally got to handle on your finances. That's an example of what I'm talking about. With 'imagine if' statements, you're not giving features.

[00:13:14.290] - Monica
Not yet. We will be doing that instead. What you're doing is explaining the benefits of your solution. Okay, now let's talk about key features. Under the benefits, you can list the key features of the product.

[00:13:26.750] - Monica
This is a more practical section. An example of this would be you'll get a 15 Google sheet, spreadsheet, or 25 printable pages. This is the actual the practical meat of what they're going to receive when they download your digital product. But here's a pro tip. All along you're going to be including visual images of the product. And anytime you can show before and after a picture of the transformation that your product delivers.

[00:13:55.550] - Monica
Do it. Because this is all about showing the transformational value of your digital product. So, underneath the key features, I recommend adding your second buy button. Number nine, more customer testimonials. A testimonial section is where you'll display things like screenshots from Facebook. If you have a Facebook group, you probably have people in there talking about how great your product is.

[00:14:18.530] - Monica
Always screenshot with people DM you on Facebook or on Instagram. If customers respond to emails letting you know that your product is great and how it helped them, screenshot that, or you can even reach out to your customers and ask them how the product has helped them and then ask for a headshot to go along with their testimonial. Number ten, frequently asked questions. This section is all about addressing commonly asked questions that are practical and addressing common objections. For example, a practical question would be, can I use this spreadsheet with Excel?

[00:14:53.440] - Monica
Overcoming an objection would be, I'm not very good with spreadsheets. Will this product work for me? Number eleven include a bio section. This is where you're going to tell people about you and why you are qualified to create the product that you're selling. You want to make sure that your bio section helps build that know, like and trust factor, and it's about how you can help them.

[00:15:20.220] - Monica
In essence, your bio is actually more about them than you. It's about how you're helping them while also making sure that you convey that you're qualified to help them. Number twelve, the final Buy Now section. Now it's time to move into getting them actually to hit the Buy button. This is the final pitch for the product.

[00:15:38.780] - Monica
You're going to include another image of the product, list the major features and end with a Buy Now button. Now, let's say someone does decide to buy from the sales page. They'll check out and they'll be sent a welcome email from you about the product. Now the transaction is done. They bought the product.

[00:15:56.850] - Monica
They are a customer of yours and you have the ability to communicate with them down the road and encourage future sales. But what happens if someone gets to the bottom of the sales page and decides that they are not ready to buy from you yet? And this is where number 13 is the key critical component to the entire Triple Dip sales funnel page. I call it the Freebie section. This is the second part of the Triple Dip funnel formula.

[00:16:25.090] - Monica
They get to the end of the sales page and they're not ready to buy. Okay, so to account for people who land on the page but are not familiar with you, you want to give them an opportunity to get on your email list with a freebie. The way I see it, if you're not ready to buy from me right now, I still want to be able to nurture our relationship in the future. With the Triple Dip funnel, your main objective is to get the sale and then your secondary objective is to collect their email address for future nurturing. At the end of the page.

[00:16:57.280] - Monica
I see something like not sure yet at least don't leave empty handed.

[00:17:01.730] - Monica
Then I include a picture of the Freebie and a sign up button to claim it. Remember, the people who are going to land on this page are not familiar with you. You don't want to lose the ability to be able to sell to them later, even if they're not ready to buy right now. If they decide to opt in for your freebie, which by the way, is directly related to the product, what the product is about, then they're going to be taken to the third part of the triple Dip, which is the limited time offer on the product that they just read on your sales page.

[00:17:30.230] - Monica
So, what I'm going to do now is actually show you an example of a triple Dip sales funnel page that converts very high for me so that you can get an idea of what this looks like in real time.

[00:17:46.630] - Monica
Let's look at a real example of what a triple dip sales funnel page looks like. I recently changed up this page and I'm testing. I believe it's really important to test different page layouts, but all of the essential elements that I talked about are still on this page. So, when you land on this page, now, keep in mind, a lot of people are going to land on this page, probably on a mobile device. I am on a very big Imac display right now.

[00:18:12.090] - Monica
So that is why it looks so big. Now when you land on this page, the first thing that you're seeing is two things. If you're on desktop, you're seeing a product mockup, so you're able to see immediately what exactly the family budget system is. There's a family budget spreadsheet, a debt tracker, printable cash envelopes, and I'm introducing the product to you. And then also there is a see what's inside with a video and a call to action button to sign up right away.

[00:18:44.710] - Monica
Then I launch into this. Does this sound familiar? And this is where I'm connecting with the potential customer and getting in the mindset of what they're struggling with and what they deserve to be different if they had control and a handle over their family finances. And then I introduced them to good news. The ultimate family budget system is here to help you and I explain how it can help them.

[00:19:13.790] - Monica
And then we have testimonials. Now we go into the practicality of everything that's included, breaking down each product in the bundle. And I have a nice price graphic showing them that they're going to save money and sign me up by now. Button another testimonial, the bio section explaining who I am, why you should trust me, why, if this works for me, it will work for you.

[00:19:38.390] - Monica
I explained practically how the spreadsheet works. It works on the go. It's super easy to use. I have the frequently asked questions section where I'm overcoming objections. I'm asking those literal questions.

[00:19:52.510] - Monica
More testimonials and the final Buy Now section. Now you probably see underneath my face over here, there's social proof notifications that are coming up, like right there. See social proof notifications. That's a really great way to validate that people are actually buying your product. Those I used a tool called Wiser, notify for.

[00:20:12.400] - Monica
Okay, so this whole part of the sales page that we just looked at the Triple Dip, this is part one of the Triple Dip. I am educating you on how the family budget system can help you manage your family finances. The goal here is to get you to click the Buy button. Okay. If you don't click the Buy button, this is the second part of the Triple Dip funnel. Not sure yet.

[00:20:36.350] - Monica
At least don't leave empty handed. Try out our free budget planner printables. And if they end up opting in for the free budget planner printables on the next page, they're going to be offered a limited time discount on the family budget spreadsheet. So, the second part of the Triple Dip funnel is right here. If they're not ready to buy, you still want their email address, so you can still communicate with them.

[00:21:04.380] - Monica
And the third part is offering that product on a limited time offer.

[00:21:12.350] - Monica
Okay, so to recap, the entry point for your Triple Dip Sales funnel page is anywhere you get leads from. Facebook, Pinterest, YouTube, anytime that you're going to encounter people who have a problem. And then you have a product that solves that problem, you're going to want to drop the link to your Triple Dip Sales funnel page. Step one is you ask for the sale. It's a sales page. Step two is you offer a freebie in exchange for their email. Step three is the thank you limited time offer page.

[00:21:38.920] - Monica
You're going to offer that same product at a special price. And the beauty of this is that you're essentially duplicating the Triple Dip page, which you can do in two simple clicks with most landing page builder, we use lead pages. My suggestion for the limited time Offer page is to use a 20 minutes countdown to produce urgency. Another suggestion is to offer a downsize product if you don't want to discount the product from your main sales page.

[00:22:05.090] - Monica
So, implementing this type of sales page into my business dramatically changed everything. I went from a 90% bounce rate off of my sales pages to 10% to 20% of people buying the product. Now let me explain what that means real quick. 90% of the people who landed on my sales page never took action. They would just bounce off the page.

[00:22:28.170] - Monica
They would read it and not do anything. Now instead, 10% to 28% of people go on to buy the product, and roughly 30% to 50% end up opting into the freebie. So, generally speaking, 45% to 70% of people who land on my sales pages that don't know anything about me still take an action. Now, out of the people who opt in for my freebies at the end of the page, they go on to convert at an average of 70% on the tripwire page. These are really good numbers.

[00:22:57.350] - Monica
It has also helped me to grow my email list, which I strongly believe is the most powerful tool that you have in your business for growing a loyal community and making money. The triple Funnel sales page helped me solve two major issues that I was experiencing. One, it allowed me to be educational instead of literal in the sales process, meaning I'm not going to just give you a bunch of product tax and tell you literally what's in the product. Instead, I'm going to inform you how my product is transformational.

[00:23:29.270] - Monica
And the second problem it solved was I get more leverage out of my website traffic now.

[00:23:34.360] - Monica
I can continue to communicate with my sales page visitors through email and eventually nurture them into a sale, whether or not they bought from me outright in the beginning or not. So, what do you think? The triple Dip Funnel page is pretty cool, right?
