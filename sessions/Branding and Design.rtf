[00:00:12.090] - Adeyinka Obisanya\
Hi, everyone. We are going to be talking about "Branding Beyond The Blog." I'm really super excited about this for a number of reasons, because if you're here, you've probably already gotten past the how-tos \'97this is not going to be a conversation about how do you make your first blog, what website should you use, what platform, those things like that. You've already mastered all of those things, and you're not new to blogging. You are ready to scale. That's typically who I'm going to be speaking to today. Because you're just so damn good at it, people are asking you, "How do you do it?"\
\
[00:00:54.740] - Adeyinka\
You're probably at a point where you're probably going to start introducing new streams in your business if you haven't already. The switch from just a blogger to now becoming a personal brand or an expert in your field is now budding. If that's the case, we need to talk because hi, my name is Adeyinka, but everyone calls me Ade. I am a brand and web designer to online female entrepreneurs. I've helped coaches launch, I've helped therapists launch, I've helped so many people launch. Something that I've seen that they all have in common on the back end as well as the front end is that they have a strong visual brand.\
\
[00:01:40.560] - Adeyinka\
Because I'm on the back end, because I see some of the marketing funnels, because I do the design for them, because I have been on the back end when it comes to them creating their courses, or creating their shops and things like that, I see the direct correlation between really good design and sales. We're going to talk about that more because that tether between the two is trust. I have designed for a myriad of people: photographers, some bloggers, some ex-bloggers, authors, the design style varies. It's very expansive. Typically, it's modern, it's clean, but things like that. But it varies based on the ideal client, which we'll also be talking about later.\
\
[00:02:25.130] - Adeyinka\
There is something very unique about the place that you're in right now. It is when your influence starts to expand. You built a blog, probably because you wanted to share a piece of yourself on the little corner of the internet, and you're like, well, if somebody starts to relate to it, I'm probably going to write something about how I got my kid to sleep through the night. I'm probably going to write about my favorite fall outfits or things like that. And people started gravitating to me because they could see themselves in you. It was very relatable.\
\
[00:02:59.340] - Adeyinka\
But again, and when you get to this point where you start scaling and you start becoming an expert, your influence expands in a different way. And people are not necessarily gravitating to you because of the relatability, because you have a Stanley Cup too. They are gravitating towards you because you are an expert. You are where they actually want to be. There's a shift that happens because you are moving from brand partnerships to mentorship. We'll talk about that more.\
\
[00:03:30.670] - Adeyinka\
When that happens, your customer base is different. When you're doing brand partnerships, typically you are just a commodity \'97it's almost like a Facebook ad. They are borrowing your audience so that they can sell to them. But again, it's really subtle and you start to place things in your everyday life like, "Oh my gosh, hey guys, I got this lotion from Trader Joe's. I really love it. It has glycolic acid in it." And you subtly drop that in there. "Oh, by the way, there's a link to my bio." It's completely different when people start asking you, "How did you do it?\
\
[00:04:08.220] - Adeyinka\
"Are you able to tell me a course on the step-by-step ways? Are you able to sell me a course on the step-by-step ways to do that?" One, the price point is different. Two, the way in which you're going to market to that person is completely different. I'm usually my client's secret weapon when it comes to them relaunching a service, or launching a service, or relaunching their business and product. There is something that I want you to know that I'm pretty sure those of you that are already at a place where you're negotiating branders and things like that, is that you're more than just a blogger. You are a complete marketing asset.\
\
[00:04:53.260] - Adeyinka\
Something that I have not expounded on is that I am a brand and web designer, but I also work in corporate. I'm an account executive, and some of the brands that I manage are the brands that you see in Target when you walk in, and they have some pretty hefty marketing budgets. They lean on influencer marketing to tap into an audience that otherwise they couldn't buy just a Facebook ad, that they couldn't buy a commercial. When you start understanding that it's more than a blog that you're trying to brand, and it's you as a marketing professional, that will be how you start winning.\
\
[00:05:38.130] - Adeyinka\
Remember I started talking to you about how you are really that tether between the consumer. Typically, what I'm seeing with bloggers is it's like B2B marketing. It's like this in-between where you are a business yourself, and then you are trying to negotiate with another business brand, to then determine what cost will it be for us to borrow some of your time and effort, and resources to market to your audience, the consumer.\
\
[00:06:09.430] - Adeyinka\
When you start branding yourself as an expert and you want to teach people how you do it, you want to start selling courses, you want to start selling e-books and things like that, that is a completely different ball game because now it is business to consumer. It's not as simple as linking something in your TikTok shop. It is about getting people to trust you and getting people to believe that you can get them to the same heights, or same realm or results that you got for yourself.\
\
[00:06:42.020] - Adeyinka\
The differences are vast. You now have to play the role of expert instead of peer. Again, I was talking about how you have everyday things like you just wear your lotion and you have your Stanley Cup. I'm a Owala girlie, you know. I'm not a Stanley Cup girl, I'm a Owala girlie. Those type of things make people gravitate towards you. As you start becoming a big, heavy hitter like your Jenna Kutcher's, like your Jalisa Jefferson, Raven Elyse, when you start getting to those levels where people might invite you to speak, or brands might ask you to consult, or people might start asking you, "How did you do it? Do you have a course? Do you have a one-on-one mentorship?" They are going to you, not necessarily because they can see themselves wearing the same leggings as you, but because you have knowledge that they don't have.\
\
[00:07:38.840] - Adeyinka\
Again, now your value is knowledge versus relatability. Another key difference is that a simple Linktree, LiketoKnowIt, Amazon Storefront, Stan.Store is no longer enough, because you now have to massage this audience in a different completely way. You need a powerful website, not just the blog that's going to support all of your marketing efforts on the back end, that's going to support when they come in for a freebie, that's going to support when they want to shop, that's going to support everything that you can have full control over it.\
\
[00:08:12.260] - Adeyinka\
That is a different realm from somebody that's just trying to figure out how to do their first blog. This is a completely different realm. And those of you that are in that space where people are asking you, "How did you do it?" This is for you. I want you to know two things. Good design reassures. Again, in order for this to work, to make that transition from just a blog to now a personal brand, a lifestyle brand, an expert in your field, you have to make people feel comfortable in giving you their money. Something happens because when you link a TikTok item, or when you link something on your LikeToKnowIt, they're going to that site for the reviews. You are actually a review. You're the middleman. But now people have to give their money to you when it comes to books and courses and things like that. They need to feel good when they get on that page. It can't be a rinky-dink page, right? It can't be a rinky-dink link. They need to feel like, okay, this person actually knows what they're talking about, and that cookie-cutter blog isn't going to cut it.\
\
[00:09:23.430] - Adeyinka\
Secondly, good design accredits. I use this example, if you remember [inaudible 00:09:28] from a few years ago, they were able to sell so many tickets because they looked like they knew what they were doing. The good thing is you actually know what you're doing, and you can market that into a course or ebook or anything like that. But they would not have been able to sell out, because they sold out. They would not be able to get some of the people to fly over there if the branding was not that good. Because the branding is going to help build credibility, and that credibility is going to get trust, and that trust is what gets people to spike, and invest in you. That's what's going to lead to sales.\
\
[00:10:03.850] - Adeyinka\
I want to test this out because I love showing this in action. This is where I think a good amount of people end up being. They have a blog. This is my old client, Candace. They have a blog, but they have a website, and it's where they pretty much dump and house everything. It's cute. It's very lifestyle, has really nice pictures and things like that.\
\
[00:10:28.480] - Adeyinka\
But I want you to question, think within yourself, which expert do you trust more? Her, this Candace, or this Candace? This Candace or this Candace? You don't have to be a coach because Candace actually is a coach. You don't have to be a coach. But again, there's that shift in expertise. She didn't lose a lot of her fun. She still kept some of the corals, she still kept the pop colors and things like that. However, her expertise is now more shown and repackaged. Candace got really, really popular online. She was already popular on Instagram, and then she blew up on TikTok.\
\
[00:11:08.430] - Adeyinka\
I've personally gotten messages from people that have ended up on her page and seen my site print at the bottom. She's like, oh my gosh. Probably the reason why I ended up loving Candace and working with her is her website. I loved how everything was just laid out. Then the copy spoke to me and things like that. That is what ends up aiding and helping her become a multi-six-figure coach, on top of whatever brand deals and things like that she's working with on the side.\
\
[00:11:35.420] - Adeyinka\
Again, this is for the person that wants to scale. They've already figured out the blogging thing. They've already figured out how to work with brands. But now you want to expand your influence and start tapping into a different market. Again, we're going to test this one more time. This is Nikita, the person that I showed in the very beginning and said, "We're going to talk about later." Who do you trust more? This is what I call very "Hey girl, hey." I talk about it on TikTok quite a bit. Do you trust this version of Nikita or this version of the Nikita? She doesn't really have to look so much of a coach like Candace, right? But she's her own version of an expert. It's very clean, it's very modern, it's very slightly moody. The aesthetic is going to vary per person, and we'll talk about that later. But again, the way in which you present yourself, you feel better knowing that this person can help me figure out how to get to their realm, than this person.\
\
[00:12:35.040] - Adeyinka\
That is an important point to point out is that even with the same content, these people aren't different. The two ladies that I said that I just showed, they're not drastically different. They don't look drastically different. Nikita has her hair the same way, Candace still has her hair very blonde. Their clothes didn't change too much, and we'll talk about the clothes later as well. What I did was represent the way in which they were shown online, so that that credibility and the expertise could pop. These things work together because they're very, very important.\
\
[00:13:15.120] - Adeyinka\
Website copy. This one you made your blog is very different because you're trying to sway a person to make a big purchasing decision. Typically ebooks aren't really that expensive, they run 20, 30, 40, 50 dollars. Courses start getting up there. The way that you speak on your blog is completely different than the way in which you would speak on a website, for an expert. Photography, people just messed that up because the way in which you take lifestyle-photos can be very "Hey girl, hey," and you and your ideal client will be on the same level, but we want that expertise to show. Again, typography can have an impact as well as color story. Notice how logo is not on here because it's bigger than the logo, it's a brand aesthetic in general, and we'll talk about that.\
\
[00:14:03.860] - Adeyinka\
Your brand aesthetic is largely determined by your ideal client. I'm pretty sure everyone's heard that already. What I will bank every dollar I have on is that your brand aesthetic is only as strong as the ideal client that you and your designer perform, the research that you guys perform on the back end. You want every design that you push out to be anchored on the ideal client. You see that each of these designs are completely different, and that's because the ideal client for each of these are completely different.\
\
[00:14:34.050] - Adeyinka\
The question is, how do we get there? Again, we want to serve as a credible source because we're marketing differently. We're marketing B2C this time. Everyone keeps talking about the like and the trust process. What I want to show is that we get there by speeding up that process with the ideal client research. Now it starts here. Like I said, when you first put your blog up, it's probably all about you. You got to show up on your little corner of the internet, pick whatever colors that you wanted. It's completely different when you are trying to convince someone to make a purchase in yourself.\
\
[00:15:12.730] - Adeyinka\
We start here in what I like to call the ideal client avatar. I like to visualize this person. In this case, this was real work for a real client. We have the corporate, she comes here, and we wanted to visualize what she would look like. This is some of the research that you would want to perform. Then from there, we get to an aesthetic. You see how here in the little room, we can see, we can picture her in that room from the ideal client. You see how we can picture her hanging out with these women at lunch, and we can see her in clothing like this? That is what we want to do.\
\
[00:15:59.330] - Adeyinka\
That's the type of research that we want to do to start to land on an aesthetic. So that when you do start positioning yourself as a personal brand, when you do start positioning yourself as someone to speak, or somebody to start consulting for brands, to add on top of these brand partnerships that you're already doing, it lands and it meets the right people.\
\
[00:16:19.570] - Adeyinka\
On top of that, once we have the ideal client set and we have the mood and the colors and things set, brand photography is where a lot of people miss the mark. Your brand photos really should show a process because now you are teaching something. It's not, again, you just picking up lotion and having it be embedded in your everyday life. You are now teaching people, this is how you can do it. This is how I can teach you how to do it. They should show a process and they should further the credibility. We don't want to keep seeing images of you walking down the street. You don't necessarily have to be in a suit, but it doesn't have to be, "Hey girlfriend" type of marketing all the time. It really, most of the time, to be honest, it really should build up that credibility as an expert.\
\
[00:17:12.680] - Adeyinka\
The issue is that most people don't plan. If you see me on TikTok, I talk about this a lot. Your brand photography is such an important tool, and you waste so much money with \'97you waste so much money not planning it. When you figured out your ideal with your designer, it really should be brought to life with props, with clothes, with the venue, with the shot list. I'm going to show you an example of it with my clients.\
\
[00:17:41.040] - Adeyinka\
Nikita, that was the second person that we spoke about where she had the purple and things like that. I helped style that aesthetic based on the ideal client that we had. I'll send over these styles and things like that. Why? Because Nikita had a membership, again, that's B2C, she had people that she now wants to sell a membership too. She now is trying to pitch to universities to start allowing her to teach about wellness and things like that. That is completely different than just a brand partnership. It's not to minimize a brand partnership, but again, we are starting to open up new revenue streams that require us to look different. It came out like this. You see some of the resemblance. You see the colors I told her to stay with. You see the textures that I told her to stay with. This is by design so that we can get to the site that we want. Like I said, good design reassures. This person, they might feel a lot more comfortable swiping their card with. They're like, oh my gosh. Yeah, I think that she would be a really good person to help me with my wellness.\
\
[00:18:51.580] - Adeyinka\
Same thing with Naboo (??). This was Naboo. This is a good point where I say it all doesn't have to be in a suit. We don't have to be in a suit. It really just depends on who you are and who your ideal client is, and finding that helpful mesh between the two. I styled this shoot as well. I usually style this shoot find locations, find a photographer, all those types of things, and they came out well. This one I actually was on set for. I flew to Chicago with her. These are the type of things that as she starts putting these pictures in her pitch deck, as she starts trying to teach other photographers how to get to where she is, they start trusting that. They start trusting her because, again, the way that she's presented starts creating a lot of that trust. Why? Because it's cohesive and it's built on all this research.\
\
[00:19:42.420] - Adeyinka\
Now that we have the ideal client, the research behind that, now that we have went and got the photos, we now can start building out the layout. Typically at this point, you have the copy. People start asking me, "What platform should we use?"\
\
[00:19:58.170] - Adeyinka\
It really honestly just depends on what works for you. I personally use Showit. If it's going to be service-based, it's going to be Showit for me. If it's going to be e-commerce, which doesn't apply to me really, it's going to be Shopify. I like Showit because there's a lot of the drag-and-drop capabilities that people really like with Wix. However, it's a lot more robust because it's backed by WordPress. Again, when I said that the way in which you present yourself matters because now your site has to be a lot more robust, it has to hit a lot more pain points for this person. If you ever see a website like Jenna Kutcher, who's a big, big, big blogger, you will start to see that she has sales pages. You will start to see that her website is not just about the blog pages and linking it. It's really serving a purpose to start funneling people into her marketing funnel. These are some of the sections you would see on a sales page, again, to get people to move off of just the site and into the places that you own, like your e-mail list and so on and so forth.\
\
[00:21:09.730] - Adeyinka\
This, you can see a breakdown of her site where we have the Header, and we can talk about quickly what's working. We have the strong images, like we said, that start supporting her sales messaging. It's a different nuance of sales. Again, when you're online working with brands, it's a lot more subtle. They want it to be organically placed in your day, but it has to be kinda subtle, not really, but not so. Again, it's a lot more pushy when you start becoming an expert because you want to tell people, "You need this. I promise you, you want this."\
\
[00:21:48.110] - Adeyinka\
Again, based on who the ideal client is, Nikita's membership is really all about finding joy after grief and things like that. We use the pictures to start showcasing that. We start using photography, and the copy, and the colors to start playing on the emotions of the people that really want to work with her, to reassure them that this is the right place. We use a lot of white text and clear call-to-actions. Again, things that are different in the world of blogging where you might just be linking things. It's really not about the style. It's just about like, "Hey, this is what I found. This is the links that you could visit later on." It's completely different.\
\
[00:22:38.660] - Adeyinka\
Again, with what's working, we want this dance between credibility, relatability, and then having people understand that they can trust you to buy. Again, this all has to do with the design, you would work with designer to make this work. They would start implementing design tactics so that they start breaking the text in the middle, all these types of things that it makes it seamless so that when someone gets on your website, they're not lost and they're not confused, and they want to continue down the page on the sales page and get off the website and into your funnel.\
\
[00:23:16.230] - Adeyinka\
We want to show the value. Again, now you have something to offer. Nikita is a good example because again, she has the membership. It's not just the blog. These are things that we use to further the credibility and let people know like, "Oh, this is what you get when you start investing in me, and investing in yourself. Then you can start to get to a place to where I am." This is really important.\
\
[00:23:44.340] - Adeyinka\
The personal brand is really important for someone that is moving forward from just the blog, and wants to start speaking, and wants to start pitching to universities, creating their own opportunities, because when they start looking up who you are, it's more than just the numbers. It has a lot to do with expertise and what expertise is shown. There's a lot of people that do have expertise, and that's why I highlighted before, it's not like people have to completely change who they were. There are people that have great expertise. It's not shown. When it's not shown, I work in marketing myself, and it's not easily seen, it's on to the next person.\
\
[00:24:33.880] - Adeyinka\
All these things work together, the design, the photos, the color theory, the typography, all those type of things work together to help you scale your business in a way that starts generating revenue.\
\
[00:24:47.570] - Adeyinka\
Really, the first question is, "How do you get started?" I have a very quick resource of condensing the rebrand. It's called the Rebrand Mastery. I'm condensing it so that we can focus on the ideal client, get you to a place where you can brand your course or brand your e-book, brand yourself, not necessarily limiting yourself to just a blogger or a TikTok influencer, or things like that. You can brand yourself to be more of a lifestyle brand, to be on speaker panels and all those type of things. This will help you get started with that.\
\
[00:25:26.730] - Adeyinka\
Again, all of these sites that I've shown is this in real action, where you can see that this person is more than just their website, but the focus is on them. You start to feel like, "Oh yeah, this person, she's important in something." Then you'll realize what the something is when you start reading the site and things like that. I highly suggest you to get the Rebrand Mastery Guide, especially if you are thinking about adding a new service or adding any service, adding a course, things like that. It will help you get started and understand like, "Okay, how do I make that shift from just blogger?" I really don't like to say just, "but how do I make that shift from blogger to also X, Y, and Z?"\
\
[00:26:13.700] - Adeyinka\
I really do thank you guys. I hope you had a really great time thinking about what more is out there for you, branding beyond the blog. Let me know if you have...\

**Transcript:**\
[00:00:13.850] - Christie\
Hello. And welcome to today's presentation where we are going to discuss how to build a standout brand even while on a budget. So, I hope you enjoy today's session. We're going to throw a lot of information at you, so make sure you have a tablet to take some notes and we'll get right into it. Alright.\
\
[00:00:35.930] - Christie\
So, my name is Christie Love Ettor, just to give you a quick introduction of who I am. And I'm an FD certified master marketer, Canva creator, and digital product creator. And, of course, my passion is branding and design made easy for the female Zylloprinora. I'm what you call multi-passionate. I love my senior Chihuahuas, and I run the gamut of doing fitness instructor, managing a contracting business with my husband for many years, as well as web design, and now I focus on branding.\
\
[00:01:11.930] - Christie\
So with that, let us get right into today's discussion. So, what we're going to cover today are the three things that you need first to create your brand. Now, I know it can be tempting to go out and spend hundreds of dollars on a logo design. But I want you to just pause for a second because before you even get to the design side of things, you need to do some research and set yourself up for success. So that's what we're going to do today. Alright.\
\
[00:01:46.130] - Christie\
Now, of course, the million dollar question, right? What is branding? Alright. So, very simply defined.\
\
[00:01:53.570] - Christie\
Branding is the process of creating a unique name, message and image in a consumer's mind. So, your brand not only includes the visual elements, but it also includes the typical things you think of, like logos, colors, fonts, and imagery. But then also the nonvisual elements, which we'll talk about more. And this is going to include things like your messaging, your niche, your values, and what you stand for. So, let's get into this where we're going to discuss these three things to create your brand, especially if you're starting out on a budget.\
\
[00:02:33.350] - Christie\
Alright.\
\
[00:02:33.710] - Christie\
So, number one and the first and most important, which is knowing your target market, knowing your audience. Alright. So, let's talk more about this because we need to have a starting point before we really start getting into our brand design. Okay. So what is your niche?\
\
[00:02:56.870] - Christie\
Do you even know who you're talking to, where you're going? So, you want to know your niche, at least in the broad sense. Right? You got to know at least have some idea of where your focus is going to be. It could be health and wellness, could be business coaches, educators, virtual assistants, and so on.\
\
[00:03:19.610] - Christie\
Right. So, you've really got to at least kind of have your category, so to speak, of who you're going to talk to. And we'll break this down with what is called a brand statement, sometimes referred to as a signature statement. And then you'll drill that down even more to who would be your ideal client. And then we'll go over the questions that you're going to need to answer in order to get to this, you know the nitty-gritty of this.\
\
[00:03:50.090] - Christie\
Alright. So let's move on to questions, questions to ask yourself first. So, feel free to screenshot this if you need to, write these down, and I will also go over in the next slide the actual formula for this. Okay.\
\
[00:04:09.290] - Christie\
So first question, who do you help? Next is why do you want to help them?\
\
[00:04:17.750] - Christie\
And what is it that you do, right? That would be good to know. And then how can you help them? Alright. So, we're going to use the answers to these questions to help write out our brand statements.\
\
[00:04:34.310] - Christie\
So let's see how we do that. Now, the basic brand statement formula goes like this. I help who, which is your target market with what, your service or product so that they can why, which is the transformation they're seeking through my how, and this is your process to achieve this. So I help who with what?\
\
[00:05:01.910] - Christie\
So that they can why, through my how.\
\
[00:05:06.410] - Christie\
So, we want to have this pretty well, you know down so that it's going to give you clarity, you know on so many things. And it's just going to make it so much easier to create your brand strategy. And this, in turn, is then going to help you to create the best visual elements that are going to represent your brand and help you connect to your audience. Alright. So, now, who is your ideal client?\
\
[00:05:37.130] - Christie\
So, there are five demographics I have listed here that you can, you know just take 15/20 minutes to think about. And you know start thinking about this avatar, so to speak, that you have or you want to reach. The first one is, you know your basic demographics like age, marital status, income level, occupation, gender, and so on. The next one would be what are their goals both personally and secular? This is really important because you know this is where you can find the people that are going to match the way that you can help them. Right?\
\
[00:06:20.510] - Christie\
So, number three is what are their values?\
\
[00:06:22.550] - Christie\
You know what do they stand for? Does it match with yours? Number four, what are their challenges, and what keeps them up at night? You know what is bothering them so much? What are their pain points?\
\
[00:06:34.910] - Christie\
Those are the things you want to think about. And then number five, where do they look for information? Are they looking online, on a blog? Do they watch TV? Listen to podcasts, you know have an idea of where you can find your audience or where they find information.\
\
[00:06:55.710] - Christie\
Alright. So, I have these two words here that are opposite, but you want to think about them, attract and repel. So, knowing the answers to the questions that we just went over is going to make it so much easier for you to find your ideal client because it's going to send the message of who is and who is not your ideal client. Right? So, your branding is either going to attract people to you or it's going to repel them in a good way, of course.\
\
[00:07:28.890] - Christie\
But you want to make sure that you're getting the right people to come to you. And then repelling the ones that are just, you know not going to be a good fit for you.\
\
[00:07:43.050] - Christie\
Alright. So, number two thing that we need to work on to create your brand is your brand personality. Like, what is that? Right. So, I'm glad you asked.\
\
[00:07:55.590] - Christie\
Alright. So what is a brand personality? It's something that just makes you you. It makes you unique. It's your essence or how you make your customer think and feel and react to your brand.\
\
[00:08:10.410] - Christie\
It's something that's not really tangible, but it has to do with that special, something that makes your brand unique and different. So, a few things that I'm talking about here are brand voice. And this would include the way that you speak, both in writing. And you know all your communication, just your communication style, basically. Then it would be your unique selling point, or USP, as it's often called. And then your personal story.\
\
[00:08:44.590] - Christie\
You know what kind of struggles have you been through that maybe others could relate to? And then a good question that you can ask yourself is, how do you want others to describe your brand? Okay. So that's, these are all going to help you to create that personality that's going to make you pop.\
\
[00:09:06.250] - Christie\
Alright. This is what I call my lemonade stand analogy. So, how can you stand out? Alright. So, there's three lemonade stands.\
\
[00:09:18.190] - Christie\
Right? We've got a kid who is you know excited to sell his lemonade. They all have the same ingredients, right. Three lemonade stands on the same street. Someone's going to buy that lemonade.\
\
[00:09:31.510] - Christie\
Right? Someone's going to come by in a hot day and say, I need some lemonade. But why should they buy yours? So, having a personal story, a unique selling point is going to help you to stand out. So, let's see an example of this.\
\
[00:09:50.530] - Christie\
Alright. This is Billy, and Billy knows how to stand out.\
\
[00:09:58.030] - Christie\
You look at the picture here, you know right away. It's so inviting. He's got lots of yellow going on. He's got matching eyeglasses and bow tie in yellow. And he's even added ice cream along with lemonade available at his stand.\
\
[00:10:15.010] - Christie\
So, I would say that's his unique selling point. So that's a good example of that. So, it's just very bright and inviting. Right. So this is what I mean when you want to find that special something that's going to make you stand out from the crowd, connect your audience.\
\
[00:10:32.050] - Christie\
But at the same time, stay true to who you are because you know, you don't want to just try to mold into what other people want. But you want to attract those people that are going to be the right fit for you.\
\
[00:10:46.810] - Christie\
Alright. So, here are some questions that you can ask yourself to find out what makes you different. Okay. You may think you're not that exciting or special or whatever, but everyone, you know we all have different taste. Right?\
\
[00:11:04.690] - Christie\
So the first thing is, what is your story? What is something that others may be able to relate with? I don't have kids, so I can't relate to moms. But I do have dogs.\
\
[00:11:19.990] - Christie\
I could easily relate to people that have dogs. So, what are things that you have experienced or you have you know in your life that others could relate to? Number two would be what sets you apart from your competitors, that would be your unique selling point. So, remember, with our example, Billy, he had lemonade, but he also had ice cream.\
\
[00:11:42.790] - Christie\
So, he had a little something extra, something that was different than all the other lemonade stands. The number three would be, what do you stand for or not stand for? Okay. So, you know you can have a strong opinion on something which is good and is great. And that is going to have the right people come to you because they're going to be like, oh, man, I agree.\
\
[00:12:08.650] - Christie\
I feel the same way. Number four would be how do you want others to describe your brand? A lot of ways to describe this. And I'm going to show you some examples of this in just a bit. So, this could be things like edgy, happy and bright, like silly, natural, athletic, you know just so many.\
\
[00:12:28.510] - Christie\
But you want to have an idea of the type of you know way that people coming to you would describe your brand. And then number five, who do you want to attract and who do you want to repel from your brand? So, think of it like, you know people are going to come to you that's attraction, that's a good thing. And then repel, like, repelling mosquitoes.\
\
[00:12:55.210] - Christie\
Not in a bad way, but it's like, okay, you know I don't want those. You know these are the ones that are really going to be able to help and relate to. Alright. Now, we finally made it to number three, which is matching the right visual elements. Okay.\
\
[00:13:16.390] - Christie\
So this is where everyone wants to go first, getting into the fun stuff. But the reason why, you know as you've seen, is there's a lot of work that goes into it first. So, what are your visual elements? There's a lot of things that come together with that. So, it's basically all the things that your potential customer comes or sees, and feels when they come to your brand.\
\
[00:13:47.830] - Christie\
This is the last part of the equation. And this is where you're going to marry those visual elements with your target audience and your brand personality that we just went over. Right? So, of course, logo design, avocon, submarks, color palette, your typography and fonts, and then various imagery, stock photos, elements, type of elements you're going to use in graphics in your design. So, this is all part of the visual elements.\
\
[00:14:18.490] - Christie\
Now we're going to break this down. And it's going to be a lot of information, but just take notes. And I will have a free guide for you that I'll talk to you about at the end as well, which is going to help you to have some examples as well and some resources that are really going to help you. Alright. So, first we have types of logos. Logos are fun. Right?\
\
[00:14:45.130] - Christie\
But there's also so many ways you can do it. So, we'll go over some of the types of logos here. First, we've got a stacked emblem and it's you know self explanatory. You've got an icon, leafy icon here, and Lady Jane, I like those old Victoria style movies.\
\
[00:15:06.310] - Christie\
So, Lady Jane Interiors. So, we have one font in all caps. And then underneath, we have a little cursive font under there, so that's a stack dumbbell. And then right beside it, it's similar, but it's called a side emblem because we put the icon there on the side.\
\
[00:15:26.290] - Christie\
So that gives it a little different look there. And you may want, you know depending on where you're using your logo, you may need to adjust it in some way. And we have a signature dual font. And that is basically using two different fonts for your logo. So, of course, we have this nice cursive look here for Lady Jane and then see more type print there.\
\
[00:15:52.450] - Christie\
Alright. Now we go down here where it's called a framed logo. And this is just a basic square with icon coming to the side. And there's a lot of different ways you could do it. But it's basically a framed look with the Lady Jane interiors there in the center.\
\
[00:16:12.130] - Christie\
Now we have a monogram or letter Mark. And this is a very I want to say plain, but it's not really the right word, simple logo, where it's basically the initials. So JC, actually, that should have been JF, but hey, you know there's no spelling bees here today. Alright.\
\
[00:16:35.590] - Christie\
So JC, and then Jane Seymour at the bottom. You could do it with just the initials or you could do it with both there as you see it here. So, it's really up to you and your taste. Circle logos are very good to have, especially for things like Instagram or other social media. So, you have that option there. We've got Lady Jane, LJ Interiors and the pretty little leaves on the side there. On the bottom left,\
\
[00:17:08.950] - Christie\
here, we have the signature font. And this is probably the easiest way to get started with your font is just to pick a script font. And it's basically just your signature there. And you can start as simple as that. Free form, this is a very stylized font as you can see this last one here.\
\
[00:17:33.190] - Christie\
We've got Lady Jane incursive, we got seymour Interiors underneath. And then as you can see, we have this little rose and the stem is creating the eye there in the center. So, it's very, you know this is going to be a much more stylized, takes a little bit more time to get the creative juices going for something like this. And then you've got your nice decorative line underneath. So, as you can see, a lot of leeway for creativity here. It's best to create two to three alternatives to your main logo, just because, as I said, depending on whether you're going to use it on your website, on you know some content, an email.\
\
[00:18:17.630] - Christie\
And you also want to have a black and white transparent PNG for each one, because sometimes you're going to need those for your content. Alright. So, there we have it. Now let's move along to color palette basics. Alright.\
\
[00:18:37.370] - Christie\
So, choosing your brand colors is more than just what colors look good together. But you also have to match those colors then to your brand personality, which we talked about a little bit earlier. So, we're just going to go over some basics first and then get a little bit more into the color. So, color is always fun. But you do want to have a little self-control, because your color palette shouldn't be more than four to five colors.\
\
[00:19:06.890] - Christie\
Your main color is the primary one, the one that you use the most. And then you have a secondary color and that's your supporting color. You can think of things like Coca Cola, you know that just have the red and white. Certain brands, you know, that those main colors. And then you have accent colors, and this is for contrast. I think maybe like buttons on a website, maybe certain headlines, things like that. Then you have a complementary color, which is a more toned-down color, often for backgrounds and things like that.\
\
[00:19:41.510] - Christie\
Alright.\
\
[00:19:41.810] - Christie\
On the right, we've got your types of colors categories. And we're going to break this down more in the next slide. But the warm colors are going to be a red, yellows and oranges on the color wheel. So, often associated with energy, brightness and action, like we saw with Billy, right? It's like it's a very you know, happy colors there. Now pool colors are going to be more, that's your purples, blues and greens. And that's going to give you more of a calming, relaxing feeling.\
\
[00:20:16.070] - Christie\
Then we have neutral colors, and this is going to be a browns, grays, black and white, and that's going to just tone down, get some balance to your other colors.\
\
[00:20:29.550] - Christie\
Alright. So, as I mentioned, we'll break this down just a little more just to learn a little bit of color psychology. There's a lot that goes into it, but it's good to at least have a basic understanding of color psychology. So, you can pick the right color palette for your brand. So, on the left.\
\
[00:20:49.290] - Christie\
Here, we've got our warm colors, which is red, your reds, yellows, and oranges. They're on the color wheel. Right. And this is going to be associated with words like energy, brightness, fun, happy, and passion. So, think about your brand as we going through these colors and think of where you might fall on the spectrum then we've got neutral colors.\
\
[00:21:13.950] - Christie\
This is browns, blacks, whites, grays. This is associated with words like integrity, innocence, elegance, timeless and conservative. So, again, you know I kind of think of like, minimalist type of brands when I think of these colors. Alright, cool colors is going to be your greens, blues, and violets on the color wheel. And these are associated with words like calming, wealth, eco friendly, like natural, spirituality, and luxury to name a few.\
\
[00:21:53.430] - Christie\
So, there you have it. Of course, this is not an exhaustive list, but it's just at least give you some basic, you know some basics there. Give you an idea of where you might you know start with your color palette. Alright. Now, types of fonts.\
\
[00:22:12.630] - Christie\
This is another wide open topic, but just like with colors, the fonts you use can impact how your customers perceive your business and the emotions that it evokes. So, we want to make sure we pick the right ones here. Now, as far as font scheme, a typical font includes two to three fonts. Do not use any more than that. You have your accent font, which is a very stylized font that's going to like both your personality, your brand personality, and then subtitle.\
\
[00:22:49.650] - Christie\
This is a slightly stylized font. It's typically used for headlines, but it's easy to read. So, you don't want it to be cursive or anything like that. And then you have your body font. And this is a font that generally has no styling. Alright.\
\
[00:23:07.110] - Christie\
When you think about body font, that's the content, the main content that people are reading. So, you want it to be easy to read. Alright. Font categories. We've got three main font categories.\
\
[00:23:19.170] - Christie\
You've got your Serif font. This is the fonts with feet or tags, and I'm going to show you some examples of these in the next slide. And this is good for headlines or subtitles, body copy in some cases depending on the font, but better for headlines and subtitles. I think they've got San serif, sans means without. So, of course, this font does not have the feet and tags, and that is best for body copy because you can, you know it's easy to read, easy on the eyes.\
\
[00:23:51.930] - Christie\
And then you have the script font. And this is going to be that more decorative font. It's very stylized, but you want to use it sparingly, because you don't want to have lines of this cursive font that people can't read. So you know, again, self-control is going to be good in this case. Alright? And what you might do is pick one San serif font and one serif font, and then one script, and that's usually a good rule of thumb.\
\
[00:24:25.710] - Christie\
Now let's break it down these different fonts, so you can see visually here what I'm talking about. So, the serif font is the one with a little feet or tag. It's usually still very easy to read. But you know depending on the font, you may not want to use it as your body font mostly for headlines. So, here, we have some examples.\
\
[00:24:50.730] - Christie\
Play Fair Display. That's one of my favorites, Prada, I love Prada. Arvo, Laura, Merryweather, Source, Serif Pro, so you can see they have the little like, at the bottom, these little lines, these feet like on the Rs and Fs. And it's just a little like curves or hooks most at the ends of the letters. Now, this font is going to be associated with words like dependable, reputable, reliable, and classic. So, just to give you an idea of matching this with your brand personality. San Serif, as mentioned, does not have the feet or tags, that's for copy because it's easy on the eyes. So, you can see the difference if you look at Play Fair Display and Pop and like, it's much.\
\
[00:25:45.450] - Christie\
I want to say cleaner, the cleaner font. It doesn't have the little tags at the bottom and the railway, Open Sans, Lato, just a few of these examples here. So, you can see when you compare the difference and why San Serif is really a good font to use for your body copy. Because it's going to be easy to read. People are not going to have to squint to read it. Alright.\
\
[00:26:12.810] - Christie\
Now, words associated with San Serif is minimal, clean, elegant, and contemporary, so very kind of like classy when you think about it. Alright. Now the stylized script, which everyone loves, of course. This is your more decorative font, often used for your logo, but you want to use it very sparingly, like as I mentioned for your headlines. So, when you compare the script fonts here to San serif and Serif, you can see there's a much bigger difference.\
\
[00:26:48.930] - Christie\
Right?\
\
[00:26:49.410] \
You see a lot of loops and cursive just very stylized. You know this is obviously just a small sample. There are lots of options, but you can see why you want to use these sparingly because of that. Now the stylized is going to be associated with words like feminine, creative, friendly, natural.\
\
[00:27:14.430] - Christie\
It's just going to give some nice pop to your brand. And that's you know, that's a good thing. But you know as long as it is used in the right way.\
\
[00:27:28.830] - Christie\
Okay. Now let's get into imagery and elements, because this is really important part of your brand. Here are just some visual examples to give you an idea of what I'm talking about. On the left, we've got a very feminine and floral brand. You see the stock photo here with the pink flowers, the notepad, polka dots, and silhouette of a woman, pink hand-drawn flower. So, all the stock photo, the graphics, the colors, all put together, create this very feminine vibe right.\
\
[00:28:12.390] - Christie\
Now contrast that with one here in the center, which is more of an edgy and dark look. Just starting with the stock photo, you can see the woman here, she's wearing a darker color. She has the kind of edgy hair.\
\
[00:28:31.230] - Christie\
The coloring is just a little bit darker. And then we have these kind of square graphics here. It's kind of a geometric but kind of edgy look to it, streaky look. We got these little strokes here, this icon of a woman that's wearing black. So, all of this put together, as you can see, just kind of creates that dark, maybe moody, edgy vibe.\
\
[00:28:58.170] - Christie\
Okay. And then we have the third here on the right, which is even different, which is earthy and natural. So, when you have this kind of vibe, you're going to have a lot of green, bright look, browns, probably here. So, it's very calming. She's this woman sitting here out doing her exercise, and it's just you know very calming and the very Bohemian graphics here.\
\
[00:29:30.090] - Christie\
So, you know when you see these different brands, they each give you a different kind. They each have their own, like, tone and feel to them. Right? So, this is what I mean when you want to marry the right fonts, colors, and graphic elements, and imagery to your brand, because all of that put together is really going to make you stand out.\
\
[00:29:58.630] - Christie\
Now, remember, nothing is ever in stone. Your business is going to evolve, and you know you may need to make adjustments along the way, which is okay. So, just make a decision, pick the colors, fonts, all those things, and just go with it. Be consistent. And then if adjustments need to be made, you can always do that later.\
\
[00:30:28.150] - Christie\
Alright. So, just to recap, here are the three things to create your brand. The first one is knowing your target market and the things are going to help you are having a niche, or at least a, you know pretty good idea of what it is. Put a brand statement together and have an ideal client.\
\
[00:30:49.030] - Christie\
If you could drill it down, you know that's just going to really help you to really be more specific on your target market. Number two would be create your brand personality. So, thinking back to the lemonade stand, what's going to make you stand out? Why should I buy from you? Right? Number three is going to be your visual elements.\
\
[00:31:11.650] - Christie\
This is going to marry everything together. Right? This is going to bring it all together, match your colors, fonts, imagery, and graphic elements with your brand personality and your target market. But then remember, as I mentioned, nothing is set in stone because your brand and business is going to evolve, and really, you need just, you want to be consistent. You don't want to be changing the fonts and colors all the time. But if you do need me to make an adjustment because you realize. You know what\
\
[00:31:44.230] - Christie\
this isn't really fitting my brand, and that's okay. You know just go with the flow. Alright. Now, as I mentioned, I will have a free gift for you, which is my one, two, three, brand start up guide to branding your online business. So, in this free guide, you're going to have resources on some of the things we talked about today, like stock photography, logos, color palette, graphics, fonts, and you know more.\
\
[00:32:17.290] - Christie\
It's a color-coded guide so it's very easy to follow. It has worksheets to help you answer questions about your brand and you know it's just really going to give you that, you know, that start you need to get thinking about everything. And it even has a list of 50 words to describe your brand or buy. So, it'll hopefully get the juices flowing and get you thinking about you know where you really want to take your brand.\

**Transcript:**\
Liz Stapleton [00:00:00]:\
Alright, guys. Super excited for the session with Christina from meyne.co. First of all, Christina, thank you so much for being here. I really appreciate it. Thank you\
\
Christina Orleans [00:00:06]:\
for having me. I'm so excited.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:00:08]:\
Yeah. Yeah. Because you're gonna be talking home pages, which and I I I've been guilty of this in the past of just having, like, my latest content, like, a blog roll up on my home page, and it's really not the most effective way to use it. Mhmm. So can you give us a little bit about your background and what we're gonna learn today?\
\
Christina Orleans [00:00:25]:\
Yeah. Well, my background is I started out as a blogger myself back in 2011. And so from there, I had a real passion to make blogs strategic but I was only working on my own. And so I moved on to helping other bloggers and I I create strategic design. That's what I do now and I've been doing that for 5 years. So I have a lot of experience and I've seen a lot of what works and what doesn't. And for the homepages, it's really crucial. Visitors have a specific goal when they visit your home page and most of us don't think about that.\
\
Christina Orleans [00:01:02]:\
Just like you said, we just put our latest post up or we just put up something that looks good. But they have a goal, and so that's what we're gonna get through is getting to their goal and your goals and turning that into a strategic design.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:01:16]:\
Okay. I'm excited for that because I'm sure I just redid my home page, recently, and I I think it's a lot better than it was, but I'm sure there's tons of room for improvement. So I'm excited to, see what you have to say, and, let's go ahead and get to it.\
\
Christina Orleans [00:01:32]:\
Alright.\
\
Christina Orleans [00:01:32]:\
Alright. So as we just mentioned, we're going to be talking about how to create an effective homepage for your blog when they get to your results. So an effective homepage can really make a difference for your blog. It can get your readers to see you as a go to resource. It can build authority and trust in their minds towards you. It can increase your page views, which is the goal of most bloggers or a goal of most Bloggers. And it can do that in a much more meaningful way as well than just getting somebody to click on a related post within a blog post. We'll talk about why a little bit later.\
\
Christina Orleans [00:02:14]:\
And it can also increase your subscribers and pretty dramatically too because of all of the above and because we can do it in a much more effective and direct way. So we're gonna talk about how to do all those things. First, I want to talk about how different blogging is today than it was a while back back when the standard was set to just show your latest posts on your home page. Just as Liz mentioned just now, it's actually still pretty common to see blogs just showing their most recent posts on their home page. This is a practice that started when blogging was completely different, and it was effective for the way people used blogs back then. People used blogs. This is an example here back from 2008, you can see, and this is a fancy blog too. It had just the sidebar, and then it just showed the the first bit of each of the most recent posts.\
\
Christina Orleans [00:03:21]:\
So it was effective back then because blogs, social media did not exist as it does today. You know, even Instagram and Twitter did not exist at this point. And so blogs were used back then to follow along with personalities and people and projects that you really liked watching. Now we have social media for that. We don't use blogs for the same way anymore. Social media is much more efficient and much more effective with things like that. Just following along with a project or a person, it's way easier to do it on Instagram than it is by subscribing to a blog. Right? So that's one reason one big difference that between blogs today and blogs back then.\
\
Christina Orleans [00:04:10]:\
So you can see if that's why we used blogs, and it was most helpful to show the recent the most recent posts first. It made sense. That's how people use them. That's what they wanted out of their blog. Today, people don't have the time or attention spans because, again, back then, social media was not what it is today. And, also, blogs got their start before smartphones existed, and so people had longer attention spans. They had more patience for, because of the the lack of all the new technology we have, and they were willing to just go to a blog home page and spend some time scrolling through, maybe even rereading some old posts. But people don't have time for that anymore.\
\
Christina Orleans [00:04:56]:\
When people go to a site, they're going there for a specific purpose. They wanna get one thing out of it. So we need to we need to rethink the home page showing the latest post because it's not, it's not what your readers are hoping to see. Showing the latest post is just not gonna solve their problems, and we don't they don't have the patience for us anymore to sit and scroll through, to search. We need to make it easy for them. So those are some of the big differences between then and now and why it's really important to to create a strategic homepage. So before we get started, there's a couple of things that we need to be really clear on. 1st is both your goals for your blog and your readers' goals for your blog.\
\
Christina Orleans [00:05:45]:\
They have goals when they're visiting you just like you have goals when you are, when you're blogging in general. So it's really important that we don't go about your whole blog or your home page with just your goals or just your rear year's goals in mind. We really need to marry the 2 and and serve both of them. If you only focus on your goals when you're blogging and when you are designing your and creating your new home page, that self-service is really going to come through. Even if it's subconscious to people, it's gonna feel a little bit do what I want. It's gonna feel a little bit pushy. It's going to feel like, they might be overwhelmed with ads. It's going to just the self-service is going to come through, again, even if it's subconscious, but it's not gonna make a connection with people.\
\
Christina Orleans [00:06:42]:\
And we need to marry that with the goals of your visitors because if you didn't focus on your own goals, if you didn't have your goals in the mix here and you were only trying to accomplish the goals of your visitors, then you would have a giant subscriber base. You would have tons of people that trusted you, that saw you as the go to resource, that just came back all the time, recommended you to everybody, did all the marketing for you. But then you would not be accomplishing your own goals with the blog. You wouldn't be making any money. You wouldn't be, you wouldn't be achieving the things that you want to achieve with your blog. So it's really important to marry your goals with the goals of your visitors. And you're going to see once you start listing them down, which I'm gonna walk you through a little bit in a second. But once you once you start getting clear on your goals and their goals, you're gonna see a really cool thing is that they are intertwined, and they overlap.\
\
Christina Orleans [00:07:42]:\
When you have something that you need to share with them with people that that you really know and can really help people, well, that's why they're coming to you. They wanna know. They wanna learn. And so there's really a huge overlap, and sometimes we can we can kind of separate them too much and just see what I want, what they want, but they really are the same thing. Okay. So it's super important to get clear on your goals and their goals first and then understand how to intertwine them and serve both at the same time. The other thing that you need to do before we get started is to check your stats. So I'm gonna tell you how to do that very briefly here, but, again, the instructions are in the workbook if you want it.\
\
Christina Orleans [00:08:30]:\
In your Google Analytics, click on the behavior option, and then from there, click on behavior flow. You'll see a really cool chart if you haven't looked at this before. It's super helpful and very good to know, but you will see a little box with your home page in it. It'll just show the backslash instead of the the, the URL of a blog post. It'll just show your show your backslash. So if you hover over that little box that's showing that's representing your home page, you will be able to see how many people come come to your home page and you'll be able to see how many people leave your blog after visiting your home page. If you're showing your latest posts, that percentage is gonna be really high. People are often just going to leave from your home page.\
\
Christina Orleans [00:09:22]:\
You do not want that to happen. You do not wanna miss the opportunity to get people to convert from your home page. No matter what that conversion is for you, you don't want them just leaving your blog from your home page. That's a sign that your home page needs work. Even and and it can be pretty high too. Even if you're not just showing your latest posts, if you have something a little bit more strategic and, then it it could still be a pretty high bounce rate. So what we're going to do is try to be strategic about it and get that lower either way. So what I want you to write down is is the today's date and how many people are visiting your home page and then the percentage of people that are leaving your home page after or leaving your blog after visiting your home page.\
\
Christina Orleans [00:10:12]:\
So we're gonna try to get that lower. So that's the stat that I want you to keep an eye on, maybe monthly, and just make sure especially after you do all this work. But just keep checking back because you can always tweak, and we always want that number to go down. That percentage that's leaving your blog, we always want it to go down. So I want you to keep track of that stat. Just just check-in on it once in a while, especially after you make changes and see how effective they are, and then you can play around and find what works for you and your audience. Okay. So now it's time to list those goals that we talked about.\
\
Christina Orleans [00:10:52]:\
And we're not just gonna list those goals. We're going to find ways to achieve those goals on your home page. We're gonna figure out what will what will support that goal. So this you probably have a big overall goal for your blog. I hope so. You should. So if you have your your overall goal, then you probably have smaller goals to help you reach that goal. So only you know what your specific goals are for your blog, and you're probably getting a lot you're going to get a lot out of this whole summit about, what goals you should set, new things you should be doing.\
\
Christina Orleans [00:11:32]:\
So keep that in mind as we're going through this. So some examples here. One of your goals to support your overall goal for your blog is probably to increase subscribers. That's a really important goal for all of us to have, whether we're bloggers or business owners or both. Growing our subscribers is huge. So how can you do that on your blog practically? This is just we don't wanna overthink it, but, practically, we do that by encouraging newsletter sign ups. Right? So that's one thing that you will want to focus on on your home page. Again, when people visit your blog for the first time, they almost always come to a blog post and not your home page.\
\
Christina Orleans [00:12:22]:\
So you've already solved a problem on your blog post. You don't need to worry about solving a specific problem again on your homepage. You need this is this is the time when we need to think about our overall goals and their overall goals and get them combined like we've said. So one of your overall goals is probably to grow your newsletter. And so on your home page, we're going to need to encourage newsletter sign ups. Another thing you might have as a goal for your blog is making money directly. And for that, we might need to drive traffic to your shop or your resources page or your work with me page or maybe an affiliate page. However you're making money on your blog or however you want to make money on your blog.\
\
Christina Orleans [00:13:11]:\
If this is a goal to make it directly, then we're going to want to add something that will help funnel visitors to drive them to those pages where they can support you, and you can help them by providing them products or services. Another thing that might be a goal is increasing page views, and this is always helpful no matter what. Again, these are the basic goals that you probably have, and how we can do that is to make your homepage really sticky, to really encourage people to not just not see to to not just skip through and say, well, I guess this blog doesn't have anything else for me. We want them to visit your home page and think that they could just stay there forever. Like, they could visit it every day and keep learning from you. So we really wanna make it sticky. And in and in support of that, we wanna decrease the ways that people can click away from it. And a big one here is social media.\
\
Christina Orleans [00:14:15]:\
So we don't generally want to really promote our social media channels too much on our blogs. We, of course, want people to come over and follow us there as a way to support our blog, another marketing avenue for us. But think about what happens when when people visit and then they see your link to Instagram and then they click on that link, but then they're just in Instagram and they've forgotten all about you and they have followed a bunch of other people. That's not what we wanna happen. We wanna serve their needs first. So decrease the ways that encourage people to click away from your blog and forget about you. We can always move those down to the bottom. That's a little trick, because usually when somebody finally gets to the bottom of a blog, then they have pretty much learned what they need to learn, and then it's a great time for them.\
\
Christina Orleans [00:15:08]:\
They're ready to ease out of your blog or your website, and so it's a great time for to lead them over to a social channel where they can hopefully follow and then get distracted by the rest of the social media. So after that, after you have your goals listed and you've brainstormed along with each one ways that you can encourage your visitors to help you achieve those goals, then in another column or on another page, we wanna list their goals, what they're coming to us for. So as I mentioned earlier, people visit blogs so that they can have a problem solved. So what you wanna do you're already solving their problems with your blog post, hopefully. So what you wanna do is you wanna make the solutions easy for them. You wanna make finding the solutions easy for them. So I'm gonna give you an example here. Say you were on Pinterest, and you were looking for a way to style your coffee table.\
\
Christina Orleans [00:16:12]:\
Well, you found this great post, and you you found this great pin, and you followed it through. You read the post. You loved what she had to say. You were really excited, and you were like, well, she has great style. She has she's great at teaching me how to do this myself. I need to see if she has more posts that are gonna help me. Maybe she can tell me also how to build a really cool gallery wall in my living room. Whatever whatever you might be looking to decorate, she is probably gonna be able to help you since she did such an awesome job with that post.\
\
Christina Orleans [00:16:44]:\
So, naturally, you're probably going to click over to our home page and see what she has what else she has to offer. But if she's got her latest post listed instead of something like categories, then you might just see, you know, something like how to pick a diaper bag. But you don't have kids necessarily. So maybe that post doesn't help you. The next one might be, you know, how to decorate a nursery. Again, not that helpful to you if you don't have kids. The next post after that maybe it's how to cook a really good post workout meal. If you don't work out, it's not gonna be very helpful for you.\
\
Christina Orleans [00:17:26]:\
You're not gonna have the patience to sit there and scroll through and search her blog and see if she has any more decor advice for you. You're just gonna leave. You'll probably save the pin so you can reference it later, but you're not gonna subscribe because you think, just naturally that she probably does not address your problems. That was probably just a one off post, and so there's no reason for you to subscribe and follow along with her. So in that case, this is this is why it's really important to show strategic categories on your blog post. So if she had had if you went over to her home page and she just had, she showed her categories and maybe the most recent 3 or 4 posts from each of her key categories, you probably would have seen an entire home decor category. And you could have clicked through to see them all, and you would have just gotten lost in her blog. So that is one way to do that, show categories on your home page.\
\
Christina Orleans [00:18:32]:\
Okay. Another way to solve her problems is to share really good freebies. Again, the key here is solving problems. They come to your blog because they have a problem to solve. So make sure that you have some really good freebies to give them that will really address a problem they have and solve it. So once you have those freebies, it's really good. It will actually accomplish both her goals and your goals. You can see here how they're marrying together because you'll get a subscriber, and she will get a solution to our problem.\
\
Christina Orleans [00:19:08]:\
And she won't be mad if you're solving her problem. She won't be mad at all about giving you her email address. She'll be happy about it. So that is the that's that's an awesome thing to be able to do. Combine your goals with their goals. So if you have good freebies, do not be shy about them. Don't necessarily be pushy about them, but just show her that they're there. Make it easy for her to sign up.\
\
Christina Orleans [00:19:31]:\
Okay. So once you have listed all of her goals or their goals, then you're going to want to build trust. You're going to want to find ways that you can build trust on your home page. So we've talked about all the elements that we can have that support your goals, that can support their goals, and now we need to add some ways that will build trust with your readers. So they've already taken it to the next level by clicking through from one of your blog posts to your home page like we talked about. So now we need to show them that they can trust you and that they've made a good decision. So the first thing is especially, this is this can be just a tiny introduction, but you want to give them a little introduction to your blog. You wanna just make a little connection with them and tell them what you blog about.\
\
Christina Orleans [00:20:25]:\
We wanna make things easy for them. We want to show them immediately that they're in the right place. So you're going to want to tell your visitors what this blog is about, what kind of problems you solve for them. And you along those lines, you're also going to want to introduce yourself because people trust somebody that they can see way more than they they trust somebody they can't see, that doesn't show themselves, that doesn't tell them who they are. So have a quick introduction of yourself. But, again, when you're doing this, remember that it's to in their minds, it's all about them. So they don't wanna see somebody just going on with all kinds of I statements, but they do wanna see your face. They wanna see you smiling.\
\
Christina Orleans [00:21:11]:\
They wanna see that you're a real person, and they wanna make that connection with you. But then they wanna know how you can help them, why you are unique, why they should follow you, and and how you're going to solve their problems. So have a little introduction to yourself, but remember, make it it make it a reader focused introduction to yourself. And don't forget the picture. Please have a picture of yourself on your home page. So another way we can build trust with our visitors is to show to show social proof. So, again, we don't wanna distract them too much with social media, especially on your home page, because we don't want them to just leave and forget about you. So what are some ways that you can do this? You when you can show if you get a lot of comments on your blog posts, then you can show the number of comments on each of your blog posts.\
\
Christina Orleans [00:22:07]:\
If you show the snippets of your blog post, so the first few lines of your blog post on your home page, then you can show, underneath the title or wherever it is, wherever it shows up in your theme, you can show how many comments, that blog post gets. And do and that's a good idea. If you get a lot of comment, then it's a good idea to show that on your home page because people like things that are popular. People want to be places where lots of other people are. If something's popular, a lot of other people are going to want to join in. That's just how social proof works. So number of comments. If you get a lot of comments, it's a good idea to show how many comments your blog post have on your home page.\
\
Christina Orleans [00:22:53]:\
Maybe you get a lot of social shares instead of comments or both. You can have both too. If you get a lot of social shares, it's a good idea to show underneath each post how many social shares you get. In some themes, you have to work a little bit harder for this, or you have to hire somebody even. But if you can show how many social shares you have for each post on your home page, it's gonna do a lot as to to show some social proof and build trust in people. And, again, social media, if you have a lot of followers, then it is a good idea to show people that. But, again, do it at the bottom if you can so you're not distracting people until they're finished reading. So the last thing.\
\
Christina Orleans [00:23:39]:\
You've listed all the ways to achieve your goals, to achieve their goals, and now you need to list the ways that you wanna build trust on your home page. All of these are gonna come together, and they're gonna be the actual elements that we put on your new strategic home page. So it might seem like a lot of tedious work right now, but it's all gonna come together quickly. So the next step is once you have all of the elements that you want, the next step is to look for some inspiration. So, of course, there's Pinterest. You can look around for blog design ideas that you like for homepage design ideas that you like. But just keep in mind, you're not looking for an exact design necessarily at this point. You're you're mainly looking for a layout and ways that you can arrange the information, ways they all those those things that's elements that you've listed off that you want there.\
\
Christina Orleans [00:24:38]:\
We're looking at ideas for how to arrange that information in a good looking way and in a helpful way. So pay attention to what other bloggers are doing and what order things are in and and think about what goals they might be achieving with having things laid out the way they are laid out. So just be really observant. So you can use Pinterest for this, like I said, but it's also a really good idea to just search look at popular blogs and not just in your niche either. I know I've I've noticed over the years as a blog designer and developer that most niches tend to stick inside themselves, stick with each other, and not even look at blogs outside their niche. But you can learn so much by crossing over to another niche. Since since the niches have kind of separated themselves and gone down different paths, you'd be really surprised at how there's different design trends. There's different layout trends.\
\
Christina Orleans [00:25:42]:\
They've just they've just, like, gone to completely different directions, and and they both have both not both. There's tons of niches. All the niches tend to have some really cool ideas that you could borrow, that they could all cross and mix together. But because they kind of stick among themselves, they don't notice that that's a cool and very potentially very helpful thing that other bloggers are doing. So if you're a food blogger, don't just look at other food blogs. That's just it's kind of a sure way to make sure that you blend right in according as far as your visitors know. Go over and look at home decor blogs and go over and look at mommy blogs or lifestyle blogs or any kind of blogs that you can think of. Just look outside your niche and look at how they're laying things out.\
\
Christina Orleans [00:26:34]:\
Look for really cool ideas that you might wanna utilize. And remember to just be to really analyze what you're looking at and and look at how things are laid out, what you might be able to use in your own blog, and then write down all these ideas, Save them in Pinterest. However you can however you can keep them together, whatever's work works best for you, just do that. So keep your ideas together. Once you have all that, you're gonna go on to the next step, which is actually sketching out a possible layout for your blog. We don't wanna get, stuck on technology at this point. We really wanna make sure that we are doing things in a strategic order for a purpose. We don't wanna get stuck with what technology can or can't do at this point.\
\
Christina Orleans [00:27:25]:\
All we wanna do is we wanna make sure that we're achieving goals here. So what you wanna do is you want to physically sketch it out with paper and pencil. It's gonna look awful unless you're a really good artist, then it might be cool. It's gonna look awful, but it really should just be this simple as you see here, just boxes. And maybe just put lines where you're gonna have text just like you see here. You can shade something in with a pencil a little bit if you need to show some color differences, but the point here is to just get those boxes out to put things where you wanna put them. And and it's a good idea to do this 2 or 3 times or even more if you need to to just look at all the possibilities, to think about how you might want it to be laid out. And don't forget to label.\
\
Christina Orleans [00:28:16]:\
I didn't put any labels in this example here, but, like, that top box might be a newsletter sign up. It might be, an ad kind of for your freebie. And then underneath that might be your about page or your shop page, whatever those goals are, whatever you need to drive people to, whatever you need to share with people. And then and then you can see at the bottom, maybe those are ways that your categories could be laid out, your key strategic categories, don't forget. So, again, some of the things that might be included here, as I said, newsletter sign up, links to shop and resources pages, your strategic categories, and the most recent posts from each one, Good freebies, and then don't forget your introductions. Okay. So, again, once you're doing this also, remember or you might not know, I'm gonna give you a couple design tips. They're not really they're they're not really design tips.\
\
Christina Orleans [00:29:14]:\
They're actually foundational in design information. So I don't want you to go too crazy with this. They're just things to keep in mind when you're analyzing other blogs and when you're thinking about how to lay out your blog. And the first one is that attention span is earned, and it's just a a proven fact that when people visit a website, if there's a lot of text at the top, they're not going to read it. They they have a very short attention span. You really need to prove yourself to them very fast, or they're just gonna skip through. So attention span is earned. Start with very small amounts of text at the top and make it really readable.\
\
Christina Orleans [00:29:54]:\
You know, use a header so that the first font is really big. And then for the next sentence, just keep it a sentence or 2. Use a paragraph font or just a regular font. Just make it really easy to scan. And then as you get farther down the page, your text can get longer and more in-depth. But at the top, keep it as simple as possible. Don't just jump in with a big blocks of text. They will not read it.\
\
Christina Orleans [00:30:21]:\
It's just the way we are. So the other thing to keep in mind is using hierarchy. So, again, I don't expect you to go and become a design expert, but this is an important point. And it's why things, like, as you see in the little sketch up on the side, it's it's why things are different colors. It's it really is a matter of guiding people through your content. And I have an example here. Oh, my text is overlapping a little bit. Sorry about that.\
\
Christina Orleans [00:30:52]:\
But you'll look at this first. Right? Isn't that the first thing you saw on this page? And then the you can see how the other, the size and the placing and the color and the the fonts, they they lead you around the page to read one thing and then another thing and then another thing. And so it's important to keep that in mind because a lot of people when they're DIY ing their blog designs, they will not use different fonts, different colors, and we don't wanna go crazy with these two things. We want to keep it on brand and simple. But this is a good example. It's really just 3 different colors and just the same font, just different sizes and different weights and and different colors. And so you really wanna keep in mind just not to keep things flat and all the same. You want to guide people.\
\
Christina Orleans [00:31:47]:\
So when something's really important, don't be afraid to put emphasis on it. When you really want somebody to see the benefit of signing up for your newsletter, don't be afraid to put emphasis on it. You wanna lead them to what's most important. So go ahead and use, one of your your brand colors behind your newsletter sign up form. Use all caps if that matches your brand fonts or use, use one of your headings. Just just keep it in mind. Again, I don't expect you to be an expert at this or to really go in-depth with this concept. But if you when you're looking around at those other blogs getting inspiration, this is another thing that you can keep an eye on.\
\
Christina Orleans [00:32:29]:\
Just watch how different backgrounds and different font sizes and different font weights, whether it's bold or normal, they really guide your eye around the page. So that's just something to keep in mind. Don't make everything the same color and the same font size. Give some interest and give and guide people to what's most important. Okay. So now that we have all of that taken care of, it is time to actually build your home page. So you should have all the elements written down. You've sketched out layouts that you can have, and and I wanna show you that it is totally doable to build this yourself in WordPress.\
\
Christina Orleans [00:33:12]:\
So I'm actually going to walk you through how to do that now. So here we are in a WordPress blog, an example of a WordPress blog. So I can show you that this is totally doable for you. There's nothing you need to be worried about. You're gonna do an awesome job building your home page. So let's get started here. First, there is a plugin that I think would be very helpful for you, and I'm going to show you some of the key elements using this plugin. It's a high quality plugin.\
\
Christina Orleans [00:33:47]:\
It's not gonna slow down your site. It is up to date. It's made by great people. So no worries with this plugin, and it's called atomic blocks. So what you wanna do is you wanna go to your plugins, and you want to click add new. I'm not going to do it now because I already have it done, but you likely know how to install and find and install a plug in anyway. So it's called atomic blocks. Again it'll be in the workbook too if you want to download that.\
\
Christina Orleans [00:34:15]:\
And just install that plugin and make sure to you should be using the new WordPress editor by now called Gutenberg. It's nothing to be afraid of. It takes a little bit to get used to, but then you won't be able to imagine going back once you make the switch if you haven't yet. So make sure you're on a new WordPress, and you have atomic blocks plugin installed. And we will get started here. So you're going to start with creating a new page to use as your home page. So you can do that, of course, by going up to new and then clicking page or going over here to page and clicking add new. You can name it home page or you can name it whatever you would like.\
\
Christina Orleans [00:35:02]:\
It it's up to you. But as long as you can keep it straight, you're not going to be publishing this page right away. So you can screw up all you want with nothing to worry about. You're not going to break anything, and nobody's going to see your work until you're ready. So title your page, and then we're gonna start adding blocks. So the first one, let's just say that you wanted your we're gonna we're gonna go back to your sketch now, so make sure you have your winning sketch that you made with you. Say you wanted to start with your newsletter sign up. Maybe you wanted an image in the background and then a, a call to action, some text, and then a button.\
\
Christina Orleans [00:35:42]:\
If you're maybe your freebie is on another page on your blog and you want them to go there. If that's the case, then there's a really cool block that we can add from atomic blocks, and it's called the CTA. So you can see atomic blocks is gonna make things super easy for us. So just click the plus button to add a new block. And then to see all they have to offer, you can scroll down to atomic blocks, and then there's the a b call to action that I mentioned. All of their blocks start with a b because it stands for atomic blocks. So if you ever wanna search, just type in a b as well. Okay.\
\
Christina Orleans [00:36:20]:\
So here is the basic call to action. A little bit boring now. Right? But, let's not worry about that quite yet. Let's add a call to action title. I'm just making this up as I go along. I had not thought this part out. You'll wanna do something better than this, obviously. Okay.\
\
Christina Orleans [00:36:48]:\
So this is gonna be great. As I said, if this is a button, and you can add the link to your page if you wanted people to go to another page to sign up. So then you can see how customizable this is. Let's add a background image. So all you'll need to do is go over here on the right, and you'll see all the really cool options. So under background options, you can select an image. Let's just go in and pick 1. Let's do this one.\
\
Christina Orleans [00:37:20]:\
Alright. So there we have a background image. Maybe that's a little bit too dark to see your text on. So another cool thing you can do is change the opacity. So you can just slide that up and down till it looks good. Maybe you wanted to change the button. Let's say click here in all caps, and the blue is not your really your color, so we'll go down to blue, button options. You can play with the size here.\
\
Christina Orleans [00:37:46]:\
You can also make it square, and you can change the button color. Let's just click a custom color and how about that? Okay. You can change the color text here as you see. You can open in a new tab, but probably you don't wanna do that unless you're taking people off your blog, which you also might not wanna do. But here we go. There's the basic options. And let's say you just want this the full width of the screen. You can see here, right here in the editor, that it's only going to be as wide as your your, your page width on your blog, but maybe you want it to go all the way to the edges of the screen.\
\
Christina Orleans [00:38:26]:\
I did not wanna save that, the Pinterest button. Let's just click on it again. And here, you can select full width. And look at that. It'll go the full width of the page. A lot of sign up options are like that as you probably know. That's how easy it is to do with a plugin like this. So maybe you don't just want the the button to to take people to another page.\
\
Christina Orleans [00:38:51]:\
Maybe you want an actual sign up form there. You can do that too. So another way to do that is to add another block. Let's just say there's a lot of ways so we can do it. In Gutenberg, there are so many block options, but let's just use cover because it's a nice and simple one. So you can use a background image just like above. So let's do the same one. Select that, and then you can see this automatically makes it darker and then has lighter text.\
\
Christina Orleans [00:39:23]:\
So let's say let's just do something super simple. You can put your text in. You can play with it just like you can writing a blog post. Let's put that in the center. And then say you wanted to add your the code for your newsletter sign up form, right, for MailerLite or Mailchimp, or Convertkit, whoever you're using, you can do that. Just while let's add another block here. Click on the plus button, and then you can search for, in the search box, HTML. You put that in, and then you can just paste your the code for your actual sign up form.\
\
Christina Orleans [00:40:11]:\
It will just go right here. Let me just do that so we can see it. And then, again, same way, you can make this full width, and it will go over the whole thing. You can also just so you know, you can, you can change the overlay color and the opacity for it as well just like the other one. So if we didn't want it if you didn't want this to be darker, you want it to be lighter, you could just change the overlay to white and then and then adjust the opacity as needed. Okay. So that's how easy it is. 2 different ways to add sign ups in Gutenberg.\
\
Christina Orleans [00:40:50]:\
The next thing that I wanna show you how to do is a really cool way to make a good looking about section. So there's a a trend right now in web design where there's a big picture on one side and then the text on the other. So I'm gonna show you the easiest way to do that. We're gonna add another block, and that is called the media block. And you'll see it here. You can see a little little graphic of a box and then some text. So let's go ahead, and I wanna move the picture to the the right side. So I'm just gonna click that button.\
\
Christina Orleans [00:41:22]:\
We'll go to media library and pick another image to use. Let's say this one. Looks good. Okay. And then right here where it says content, you can just write. And, of course, write something way better than that, please. But in just an introduction to what the blog is about. Okay.\
\
Christina Orleans [00:41:51]:\
You're gonna need more text than that, and and it's gonna need to be better than that. But that's this is how, to do to add a feature like this. You can also adjust the size. Super easy. So many options with this new editor. And this is also not part of Atomic Blocks. This is built into WordPress, so you can use this with any theme. Okay.\
\
Christina Orleans [00:42:14]:\
So there we go. That is how to add that, and you can do the same for the about you section. Maybe switch sides and put the image down down lower when you do the add this block again. Switch sides, put the put image of you on the other side and then the text on the other side, and then it it's look. It looks great. It looks continuous, consistent. Alright. So let me show you a quick way to add the categories.\
\
Christina Orleans [00:42:40]:\
You can add the most recent posts from each category. So what you wanna do first is add a title for your category. So we are going to add a block, and let's do a heading. So this is your most important category, the one you wanna drive people to, the one that people want to see from you. If I can stop talking, I'll be able to spell category. So this is a heading. You can center it if you'd like. And then click the plus button again.\
\
Christina Orleans [00:43:14]:\
We're going to use a very cool block from atomic blocks. So scroll down to theirs, and then you will see here somewhere, ah, the first one, a b posts and page grid. Click on that, and it's going to automatically grab your most recent posts in all of the categories. Again, as we've been talking about, we're gonna be way more strategic than that. So when you click inside this block, you will see all kinds of options here on the right. That's gonna probably stay post for content type. I'm not gonna go through all the options, but the key one right here is category. It's showing all categories.\
\
Christina Orleans [00:43:56]:\
Let's just say we want to show this most important category. So just click on that, and it's only going to show posts from that category. So you can change the number of items that you show just by sliding this or typing it in. Whatever you wanna do, you can change the number of columns to 3 or 4. Obviously, do what looks best for your blog. You can even do 1 column. We're gonna put let's put it at 3, and let's say 6. So as you can see, this is not looking so great as is.\
\
Christina Orleans [00:44:31]:\
So we're gonna make some adjustments here really quick. We're gonna go down to post and page grid content. It's grabbing a full size image, so it's going to be let's let's do squares instead. So select the square. We don't need to put the author. We do want the title to show. We probably don't want the date to show. So here we have the title of the post, the featured image, and then we have an excerpt.\
\
Christina Orleans [00:44:59]:\
That's a really long excerpt for what we're using. So we're just gonna grab this and slide it down until it looks good. And that's pretty good. Right? You can also remove it altogether if you don't want it. It's a good idea to have a little bit, though, if it fits with your theme and your style. You can change the text if you want, and look at this. So then when you have more categories to add, just add more. You could also change it up.\
\
Christina Orleans [00:45:25]:\
If you have one category that's more important, you can have it show just 1 post wide, one one column instead of 3 columns like this. So the op the the options are really endless here, and it's done in such a simple way. Let's go ahead and preview this to see what it looks like. Again, you saw that this took about 5 minutes to make. Oops. And we still have our sidebar. So here's a good thing. Let's get rid of that sidebar.\
\
Christina Orleans [00:45:52]:\
Now this is gonna be different for depending on what theme you have, but if you're using a Genesis theme, the quick and easy way is to click on this g for Genesis up in the corner, click default layout, and say full width con content, and then and then that'll take that away. I'm not gonna do that right now because I wanna wrap this up, but you can see how cool. Just imagine it being full width, and then and then you'll see how easy it is. Look. There's your categories, and it's still showing the the long I didn't save it since since shortening the excerpts. But you get an idea how easy it is and all the cool things that you can play around with and do. Let me click back and show you, just you there are so many options. You can change background colors.\
\
Christina Orleans [00:46:41]:\
You can play around. Just look for some some basic WordPress tutorials if you're looking for things like that, but this is how easy it is for you to create your own strategic homepage. So if you have any questions about any of this, please, reach out, ask the questions in the chat, and I will be there to help. Thank you so much for being here. I really appreciate it.\

**Transcript:**\
[00:00:07.580] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
All right guys. I'm super excited to learn from this next speaker. Dan is the owner of DJR Designs, who is a strategic graphic designer who impacts coaches, speakers, and course creators with the ability to transform existing designs into compelling visuals. He helps make these designs resonate, engage, and start conversions with their target audience. Dan, a big warm welcome. Thank you so much for being here.\
\
[00:00:34.000] - Dan Rondeau\
Thank you very much, Liz, for having me here. I'm really excited to really do this. And I will let you know that you really are the first Summit that I've really gotten into to do this. I speak quite a bit in networking groups and everything like that, but to be like platform Summit and everything too, I was like, 'Oh', I'm like, 'Yay'. So, I'm super excited that you have the first ability to have me here in front of your audience.\
\
[00:01:00.840] - Liz\
Yeah, no, excited. I'm going to let you take it away.\
\
[00:01:03.620] - Dan\
All right. I'm going to put my slideshow up over here, and I'm going to pop this into here. I just need the good word that you can see everything good.\
\
[00:01:16.740] - Liz\
Yeah, I think that I'm good.\
\
[00:01:18.660] - Dan\
Beautiful. All right. So, again, thank you so much. What I really wanted to come to the table with, when it comes around to designs and everything, is that you really do have a great amount of visuals that you can use in your business and really leverage how much power you have when people are looking at your designs. Hence why I went with this title. It really shows when you're thinking about the impact that you're making, whether it's for your business, if you're doing it for somebody else, or you're doing it for a marketing piece. It really just ties all back in together to strategically look at how you want people to see what you're doing in that. So, just to give a little quick on me. I'll just give you the rundown on this, too. So, I've worked in the pharmaceutical space for over 13 years, and it really was a change for me when I wanted to get out of that space. I really didn't want to stay there. It's not my thing at all whatsoever. I really just wanted to focus more on helping people because that's why I went into healthcare originally. But then, in turn, it really transitioned into 'I don't want to be there anymore'.\
\
[00:02:31.630] - Dan\
So, I left there in August of 2020. I was already a little bit into my business by then because I had worked in this for over seven years, but knew that wasn't my space. This was the space that I was really going to help more people in, and focusing heavily on that strategic side of the designs with all of the marketing collateral that goes with it. It really makes such a difference when you think strategically through everything. And then, of course, there's my wife and my daughter. I've been married to my wife for 11 years now, and my daughter was just born in June. She was six and a half weeks early. We had a very long 2023 when it came to that. But she really is the why of why I do this. Without her, my wife, and a few other very important people in there that are supporting me along the way, this whole thing wouldn't have been a reality when it comes to this. I've been blessed to have them here. Every day that I get up and I'm here, I'm taking care of my daughter, and she's the reason why I do this every day, and I love it for that reason.\
\
[00:03:44.760] - Dan\
All right. So, pieces of why I'm coming today. We're going to talk about captivating your audience, really knowing why the visuals are there to make that impact, then the consistency that comes with them, and why it's important to keep that consistency throughout everything. Then a little bit of food for thought when it comes to that. All right. I'm doing everything on my other screen so I can just solely focus straight on you so you don't have to look at anything. All right. So, captivating your audience. So, why are the images that we are using very important for this? One, you want to make sure that what we're doing and putting out there is going to make that influence. So, it does influence the decisions that your audience is going to make and take action. So, whether that action is they're going to click on the link in your bio or in the blog itself to keep reading. If your marketing piece is out there, are they going to click on it to make a sale? When you have that captivating image that's going to drive them to want to do something, then of course, they're going to want to do it.\
\
[00:04:53.340] - Dan\
And you don't want to have them sitting there pondering their thoughts behind this because again, they're just going to sit there and then might not take an action. So, we want to make sure that we take that action in that. It also creates a very strong emotional side to things because we all play on emotions. And depending upon where your target audience is, who you're targeting, you really want to think about what emotions that they're going to be feeling coming into this. When I'm using it for marketing pieces, and we're looking at how we want to bring that audience right in, we want to make sure that we're tugging at the heartstrings of those that need it, or we're actually going to have something that's going to be like, 'Yes, I just want to click on it right now. Just take my money. Take my money and go there.' And sometimes it's got to be right in that middle piece where it's like, 'Yes, I understand where you're coming from that. I need to learn a little bit more about you. So, let me click on your bio, or let me click and find out how much more we're actually going to be doing into this.'\
\
[00:05:55.200] - Dan\
And then it also really develops that strong recognition for your brand. Brand recognition is very heavy, depending upon whether it's your business, your client's business, or wherever it is. You want to make sure that they know that it's driving to them. So, whether that's using pieces of your colors, your fonts, everything that you have, it's going to play a little bit of an influence in that. And you want to make sure that they're recognizing, hey, that's you. As you can see, I have a lot of the diamonds in mine. It's also in my logo and everything. That keeps that brand recognition there. So, if somebody happens to see that gradient pattern that I have in that, they'll automatically know that it's me after a certain amount of time, which I'll get into afterward. But it keeps that recognition there. The imagery that I use in all of my business, it's very strategically aligned to make sure that what I'm talking about is actually going to resonate with them and make them want to learn more about me, or whatever it is that we're talking about. And cluttered images convey less. A lot of people think that you can take an image and try and throw everything that you need to learn on it, and then people are going to be great.\
\
[00:07:07.070] - Dan\
They'll pick the pieces that they need out of it. I look at a very cluttered image, and I'm like, 'Nope, I just got to keep moving on that,' because I'm like, 'That's too much for me to stop and take a quick look at.' So, less is always more. If you're conveying everything that you want it to convey on the image, then you're great. If you're conveying less on the image and it's actually driving the message even more forward, then you're great. You don't have anything to worry about because it's getting across to your ideal audience exactly the way that you want it to. If they have to stop and think about things a little bit more and be like, 'Okay, I have to stop. I have to really read this.' I'm like, 'Okay, I'm moving my eyes all around it.' Yeah, you're great because you're thinking, 'Hey, they're going to stay a little bit longer to read this.' They may not pick up on all of these things or not make the decision to want to click on them. And then infographics, something that I have seen very limited amounts of that have been going on throughout business.\
\
[00:08:06.660] - Dan\
I used to do social media as part of my business when I first started this, and infographics were very heavy, let's say, seven years ago, because it's been about that long since I started doing this. Everybody was doing infographics. You'd see them everywhere. Over the course of the time that social media has progressed, I've seen quite a bit less use on them. If they are done properly, you can convey a lot of information in a very small amount of infographic. Plus, it allows them to keep scrolling down on them. They'll be able to read them a little bit more, and see all the info. And if they're picking up on the pieces they want, they'll click on them and then it'll learn more from there. And my takeaway on this as well, too, for you is that you really do have eight seconds. And I'm going to say even eight seconds or less in most cases, depending upon the platforms that you're using, to help make that impression on your ideal audience and get them to either stop the scroll or else they're going to just keep scrolling along. And the goal in this is that you want to keep their attention long enough so that way they make this decision to either look at your info, look more about you, or read what you want.\
\
[00:09:17.410] - Dan\
Otherwise, if it's not hitting them, they're just going to keep scrolling. And in the TikTok world that we live in and Instagram scrolling, that's what happens quite a bit. I look at my own thought process and how I do things as well on my own social media, and I am that person as well too that if it doesn't resonate with me, I'm automatically moving on from it. All right. So, visual consistency across the platforms. Cohesiveness is something I preach a lot about because I'm very big about knowing that when you're looking across all areas, whether it's just the blog, just the website, just all these things, you want to make sure that each piece of these things is consistent across. You don't want to have somebody going to your website, then going to your social media, and it's a completely different look, and feel. They're going to start questioning whether or not they're using this platform correctly. Are they still active? Is the business even still open? You want to make sure everything stays the same across and by the same, I mean the same elements. It doesn't have to be the same exact image going across everything.\
\
[00:10:29.690] - Dan\
If you're using diamonds like I'm doing in the PowerPoint, you want to make sure that you're at least using that strategically throughout all of the platforms - all the same colors, all the same fonts, everything that matches - so it makes this nice little [inaudible 00:10:44] package that they keep coming back to at all times. So, static social media images, if you're using them on Instagram, if you're using them on Facebook or wherever, keep the same flow going through everything - brand colors, brand fonts, and everything. And then also to note that you don't necessarily have to use different images throughout all of the social media. You can still use the same ones which used to be a no-no. Beforehand you'd want to change things up. But still, I have never seen anybody recently go through where they have to recreate the same image four different times. They really just want to make sure that if you're using it, it's another piece of that brand recognition and everything strategically stays there. Stories and Reels - Your stories mimic a lot of the static posts, and they can just vary briefly just to make sure that it all fits cohesively on there.\
\
[00:11:37.590] - Dan\
Reels tie into the next one, which is the video cover images. If you're posting a reel on Instagram, create a cover that can go with that. For the people that like to have the cohesive grid, which works for certain brands and for certain businesses, and it doesn't for others, it keeps that flow there. Plus, it's another piece that they'll be able to click on, remember that it's you, and then keep going from that. Thumbnails - Whether that's a YouTube thumbnail or your actual blog thumbnail that you use on your website, keep it all within the same brand - everything that matches. Plus, on top of that, you can also use that same thumbnail variation that you have on there. You can use those same elements throughout the rest of these pieces. Headers and Banners - I'm going to come back after for more on the headers piece because I have a very big piece on the headers and the banners. But those are key elements that you can be using to drive people to your website, to drive people to the blog, to drive people to wherever that you need them to. So, utilizing them more than just, 'I'm going to just throw something up there to have it because I don't want to have on LinkedIn the little blue background that's at the top.' Or on Facebook, 'I don't want to have something blank on there.'\
\
[00:12:57.850] - Dan\
You can constantly keep using these and updating them to reflect your brand and actually get more traffic to be driven out there. I'll go into more of that after. And then Pinterest pins - I don't personally use Pinterest enough. I really do think that it drives, depending upon the business that you have and exactly who your target audience is. So, certain businesses will have a much better reach on Pinterest. However, if people are looking for certain things, those pins will be another piece of that brand recognition that you have created and you'll be able to use it, and leverage it more for search purposes. Because I do come across a lot of things when I'm searching on Google or YouTube, and it ties back to a pin somehow. So, it just creates another little notch that ties into the next piece, which is that you need a minimum of 20 touchpoints for that brand recognition. And it doesn't necessarily have to be going to the website alone or going to one social media post. That's just one piece to them. So, if they're bouncing between their website, your social media, Pinterest, and YouTube, that's all a touchpoint.\
\
[00:14:17.130] - Dan\
And if they're seeing the same elements of your brand, and the same themes and values that you're bringing to that brand, it's all going to tie back together into that 20 touchpoints. Once they hit that 20 touchpoints, they're probably going to be like, 'Wow, I keep seeing this person all along. Maybe I need to go follow them.' Or, 'Maybe I need to DM them.' Or, 'Maybe I need to reach out and see, are there services, something that I need to utilize more.' And then some design food for thoughts. Just some things that I didn't know that would have a big impact on this presentation as far as where I could put them that would make it really fit. I wanted to just throw some thoughts out there for everybody to use. Done is always better than perfect. That has been preached to me so many times, and I'm still one as a designer that I have to have everything perfect in this. And it sometimes bothers me to the point that I have to stop and walk away, and remember that as long as I'm getting the feelings and emotions that I want out there, or my audience wants out there, or my clients want out there, what I have is going to work.\
\
[00:15:34.740] - Dan\
So, if you're thinking strategically about how your design is going to influence that audience and you're feeling that and you're comfortable with putting that out there, done is better than perfect. It does not have to be absolutely the best because you will grow each single time that you keep doing this, and you will get to the point where you're going to be like, 'Boom, boom, boom, done. I'm good. I don't have to deal with anything else on that.' All right, back to the banners, which is what I talked about. Banners do act as a billboard for your business. Think that every single time that somebody visits your LinkedIn profile, your Facebook profile, your Facebook Business page, looking at an email, there are banners on each one of those. If you are not using those to leverage traffic to your website, traffic to your blog, if you have a product or service that you're offering - and Liz, I'm going to throw you into this as well, too, because I saw your LinkedIn because I looked at that right away to make sure that I could tie back into this. It does talk about this, the Summit that you have in here.\
\
[00:16:39.350] - Dan\
So, again, it's driving the traffic back to your Summit, and it's driving back to whatever piece of the business that you're promoting at the time.\
\
[00:16:49.310] - Liz\
Did you say you looked at my LinkedIn? I have no clue what's on there.\
\
[00:16:52.990] - Dan\
There was something about the Summit on there. [crosstalk 00:16:55].\
\
[00:16:56.810] - Dan\
Now, I'm going to tell you whether or not it was the Summit you did last time or this one, it doesn't matter because I did look at it because that was the one thing. I was going to try and grab some examples somewhere on this. [crosstalk 00:17:07] \
\
[00:17:09.230] - Liz\
I'm never on LinkedIn. I have no clue\
\
[00:17:10.340] - Dan\
Well, you have something on there. So, I'm going to tell you right now that it was another reminder that, 'Oh, good, so she is promoting the Summit that's going on, on there.' And I know that some people don't update those. And I've seen some that are still talking about what when they were in their corporate environment before and now they own a business. Or there was something that they did 10 years ago that they don't even offer anymore, because they're not thinking about updating that. It's good to update those banners more than once, more than just when you have a brand overhaul. Why not update them consistently? Because if you're having new individuals coming to whatever social media or your email specifically, because you send those out every day, you have that promotion right there for you. So, utilize it, and update them. And a little tip that's not on there is that A/B testing on banners is always fun. I do this a lot with my clients. We'll take their Facebook Business page, and if they have a Facebook group, we will create the same image, pop one on one, and then use the same elements, but just tie it a little bit differently in another and see which one gets traffic. Because you might have different audiences being driven to each one of their different pieces of that, whether it's the group or the Facebook page.\
\
[00:18:36.460] - Dan\
On LinkedIn, we just constantly have always been updating my clients depending upon what they're doing, whether it's summits, or they have a new product that's coming out. If they write a blog every month or week, then we might want to pop that up there and be like, 'Hey, check out the blog.' And if it's something they want to consistently keep promoting, keep it up there for as long as you need to. Templates are great tools. And I'm going to stress that because templates are that, they are templates to help you get to where you need to go. When you need something quick, and I call them down and dirty at this point, you need a down and dirty graphic that just needs to be done, go for the template. But also be mindful that, especially around Canva, templates are very overused. And as you start noticing other people's graphics that are going out there, you'll start noticing the templates that are out there because they use the same templates. It's always the first five or eight that are up there that they just keep grabbing because, 'Hey, it's good. I can just use this.' If you want to stand out a little bit more than just having the graphic be done, take a couple of different templates that you see on there, plop them all into three different panels on Canva, take the fourth panel and start playing around with it.\
\
[00:19:50.410] - Dan\
Don't overdo it. Just go with the flow. So, if it takes you half an hour to do it, great. But if you're down in there and you're talking seven, eight hours into it, pause, go back, look at the template, and then just go with the one that's going to work at that because it's not about prolonging the process. It's really about simplifying it and making you stand out more. DIY versus professional. This one I get asked a lot - when is it time to start thinking about this? And at the beginning stages, go with the DIY because you want to utilize the time that you have and, of course, the resources to just keep going with that. As you're building this brand and as you're building this business up to a point where you're either not getting the ideal audience into your network, you're not having these conversations, or what you're putting out there is really not resonating with you anymore, and you're like, 'I don't want to do this anymore,' that's the time to think about, 'Okay, maybe I do need to bring somebody in to start helping me build this.'\
\
[00:20:57.100] - Dan\
That may be a VA that just knows how to do basic design work, but be mindful about the fact that you want to make sure that they understand your brand, your visions, who your ideal audience is, and be able to help transition those conversions to you. If you're still not getting any of that, then it's time to go to somebody who solely does this, and understands your market as well, too. And as long as they are willing to, I use the term co-create with you, that's the piece. This is not a one-way street where I just tell you what to do. You have visions, you have goals, and it's your business. If I create something and you're not willing to put it out there for any reason, that doesn't work because now you're spending money and not using anything and having to go back. This is a co-creation process. We take everything together and make it work to exactly what you want as a business. And then your ideal audience and your brand is always at the focus. Always, always, always think about them before you create any design piece that's in there because you want to make sure that who you are targeting is actually going to be the one that's coming into your world, and also that you're not driving them to your competitors instead.\
\
[00:22:18.150] - Dan\
Because I've come across that quite a bit as well, too. People think that they're doing a great job and then realizing that, 'Yeah, what I'm doing or the imagery that I'm putting out there, it works for me because I like it.' But if your ideal audience doesn't like it, then it's not really working.\
\
[00:22:34.370] - Liz\
I like that.\
\
[00:22:36.370] - Dan\
Thank you. And then 92 % of purchasing decisions are influenced by the designs as well, too. So, think about that when it comes to the actual products that you have out there. Just keep in mind that you want to make sure that you're putting out those quality things that are doing and bringing in that audience to make that decision to act and say, 'Yes, I want to work with you.' Or, 'Yes, I want your product.' Or, 'Yes, I want to read more and make that work.'\
\
[00:23:07.020] - Liz\
All right. I have a lot to do now. I have a lot of banners [crosstalk 00:23:12] that need fixing.\
\
[00:23:13.550] - Dan\
I didn't think that I was going to make you have a laundry list out of this.\
\
[00:23:18.300] - Liz\
It's okay. It's okay. It happens every year. I'm like, 'Oh, I got to do that, too.' How do you feel about doing a little critique? I opened up my Canva, I opened up some older designs. You want to do a little critique? Because I always love a good [crosstalk 00:23:32] real-world example.\
\
[00:23:34.900] - Dan\
You're going to let me play strategy session? Oh, my. Oh, yes.\
\
[00:23:39.130] - Liz\
And I promise my feelings will not be hurt by whatever you say.\
\
[00:23:44.190] - Dan\
And as I say to every one of my audience as well too, is that I'm here to provide any info that I can for you. Whether you want to take the info and do something with it, that's not up to me. That's up to you. I'm here just to help, and however I can help in whatever way. And if it resonates with you, take it. If it doesn't, send it packing.\
\
[00:24:11.100] - Liz\
Sure. So, based on what you're saying, I feel like this is a tad cluttered.\
\
[00:24:16.110] - Dan\
It is a tad cluttered for me. Plus, the other thing that I would also like to know is how far back was this? And this might also tie back to our discussion on the LinkedIn imagery because I feel like this might be slightly different than what your brand is currently. And tell me if I'm wrong.\
\
[00:24:38.860] - Liz\
I mean, you're not wrong. It is one of my brand colors.\
\
[00:24:42.490] - Dan\
Okay. It's the feeling that I'm getting off of it, though, I think.\
\
[00:24:46.810] - Liz\
Okay, [crosstalk 00:24:47] so this is like a thumbnail for a course in ThriveCart. So, yeah.\
\
[00:24:52.620] - Dan\
Now I'd want to know what the actual ThriveCart looks like. Because if you notice when I do this, it's because my brain's starting to move. Okay. [crosstalk 00:25:01] \
\
[00:25:02.040] - Liz\
I don't know. We can go look now.\
\
[00:25:05.020] - Dan\
I need to see what it looks like in the ThriveCart, because that's also going to be another piece on this as well, too. And if that little tiny Thumbnail...\
\
[00:25:12.770] - Liz\
It looks like that.\
\
[00:25:14.800] - Dan\
Okay. So, when I look at this on that, I need a little bit bigger on the... No, not you having to do that. I'm talking actually the image itself, because if I'm looking at that quickly, the words in white are all jumbled to me. [crosstalk 00:25:35] I don't know outside of looking at what it is on there. But if someone's coming quick on that, let's look at the affiliate disclosures made easy down there, that's really readily... I can do that so quickly that I know exactly what I'm looking at.\
\
[00:25:51.740] - Liz\
Okay. [crosstalk 00:25:53] The yellow is too hard. Got it.\
\
[00:25:54.760] - Dan\
It's not even just that it's too hard. I think the white on the yellow is [inaudible 00:25:57] \
\
[00:25:57.990] - Liz\
Oh, yeah. There's not enough contrast.\
\
[00:26:01.240] - Dan\
Correct. You're a confident contributor there. Whatever is underneath all of that, I have no idea what that says.\
\
[00:26:08.630] - Liz\
No, [crosstalk 00:26:09] it does show up a bit bigger for students when they're actually in the dashboard.\
\
[00:26:14.110] - Dan\
Okay. So, then that makes a difference. [crosstalk 00:26:16]. That makes the difference on that. \
\
[00:26:21.080] - Liz\
Okay, so good. I actually also pulled up an old infographic I made back in the day. Because you talked about infographics. It's a lot. I have some other ones that probably aren't very good either.\
\
[00:26:36.190] - Dan\
A lot, because I'm looking at this and I'm like, 'Oh, my, there's a lot that goes into this.' I think if you had... I'm not trying to formulate this the way that I want to.\
\
[00:26:47.680] - Liz\
How could this be at all recovered?\
\
[00:26:50.850] - Dan\
No, it can be recovered into this. There are pieces that can be done to this. Obviously, limiting down the...\
\
[00:26:59.020] - Liz\
The amount of text.\
\
[00:27:00.380] - Dan\
The amount of text into this. So, pieces of this could go [crosstalk 00:27:01] \
\
[00:27:02.530] - Liz\
I told you I pulled up bad ones, right?\
\
[00:27:06.290] - Dan\
Well, you did this on purpose.\
\
[00:27:08.180] - Liz\
I did.\
\
[00:27:10.120] - Dan\
A lot of these things could also be placed into... I'm going to put this in blog category in this. So, let's think of this as you're adding this to a blog as well, too. The information that's on here, all of this not having the affiliate things like that, that can be added into the blog to tie back into this as well, too. Because if you're putting the title on that completely great at the top. I might...[crosstalk 00:27:35] \
\
[00:27:35.900] - Liz\
Then get rid of that.\
\
[00:27:37.140] - Dan\
I might formulate the words a little bit more just to make it fit a little bit tighter into that. And from my thought process, because this is how I think, I say you have your dues at the top, or on one side you do a full green [crosstalk 00:27:55] for dues. And I'm big about also using some actual, I'm going to say 'Do' in this case.\
\
[00:28:05.030] - Liz\
Like an icon?\
\
[00:28:06.290] - Dan\
Icon that goes with it. Let's put a checkmark in that. So, if you have 'Do' at the top it could be in that nice light green that's right there. And then you have the 'Do' and you're good. And then the first thing is checkmark. Place your affiliate links there. Checkmark. Next one down. Checkmark. Then 'Don't' nice and bold and nice X icon on each one of those to bullet it down. [crosstalk 00:28:34]. tighter you don't always have to go into full detail because in this case, that 'Don't', the middle one, those are the ones that are standing out because there's enough information in there to get that information out. So, place your disclosure statement. That's perfect. You don't place it in the sidebar. Now I'm trying to think of how can we condense down that chunk of information into maybe 2 to3 lines to match up with everything. Because some people may skip over that because they're like, 'That's a lot of text to read.' Because TLDR in this world that we live in.\
\
[00:29:09.890] - Liz\
Yeah. Well, and this is several years old, at least, just for work.\
\
[00:29:15.120] - Dan\
Yeah. But again, you just grabbed something quickly.\
\
[00:29:17.850] - Liz\
Yeah, I was like, I know I've made some, but yeah. Okay. \
\
[00:29:21.080] - Dan\
All right, so scroll back down to the bottom there. Okay, so...\
\
[00:29:30.590] - Liz\
I love that.\
\
[00:29:33.170] - Dan\
No, because I'm thinking of how I can make this piece of that, grab that free affiliate disclosure swipe copy [crosstalk 00:29:39] into something else.\
\
[00:29:40.730] - Liz\
I don't know that I even do that anymore. I don't think I do.\
\
[00:29:43.070] - Dan\
No, but you had it at the time. So, I'm thinking that could also tie back into a button even on this as well, too. That it could be, 'Grab your free affiliate disclosure swipe copy,' and then in that button, it's like, 'Yes, I want this' kind of thing. It doesn't necessarily mean that they're going to click [crosstalk 00:30:04]\
\
[00:30:04.510] - Liz\
Yeah, but just the graphic of it, people think of clicking.\
\
[00:30:08.280] - Dan\
Correct. Because they're going to want to click on that. And then if it's hyperlinked back to it, beautiful, then you have something there. If not, then you could always add in the text in there, some sort of emoji that goes into the finger that points to here or something to tie that back. And then I would also... A little smaller on your elizabethstapleton.com, and it's centered perfectly and that has no problem there. I think I just might make it a little bit smaller. I mean, if you're promoting this out even further than yeah, you want them to see that, but if this is going inside the blog, you're already on your website as well.\
\
[00:30:50.000] - Liz\
I'm pretty sure this is floating around Pinterest somewhere.\
\
[00:30:54.460] - Dan\
I could see that as well, too. I can see that very much as well, too. \
\
[00:30:59.580] - Liz\
Yeah. Okay. No, that's great. We could go on and on, but we need to wrap this up.\
\
[00:31:04.000] - Dan\
Yes, I know because I don't want to hold [inaudible 00:31:05] [crosstalk 00:31:07] \
\
[00:31:05.640] - Liz\
I know you've got something for everyone. Why don't you share that and tell us about it?\
\
[00:31:11.650] - Dan\
Sure. So, going back to the piece on the brand as well and to make it work very well for everybody. There's going to be a Canva template that will be provided that walks through the brand. It gives you your brand colors. You have a place to put all your logos, your typography, and everything that's on there. I didn't also realize that I was that dark when it got dark over here [inaudible 00:31:34], but it adds a little bit of the glow into this without me trying to do that. But the brand sheet will add a lot more layers than just what Canva provides on top of that, because you'll have these spots to put all of these things. And for those that aren't going to be in your Canva, you'll be able to download this as a PDF and be able to just spread this out. Because if you have someone working on your website, your copy, all these other things, they're not necessarily going to be in Canva. You want them to know exactly what it is about your brand that's going to make their life easier going forward, because they'll be able to look at this and be like, 'Okay, now I know I'm going to resonate with this as well.'\
\
[00:32:15.680] - Dan\
And then I'll also add on those pieces, so this way you'll know what your mission is, the values that you have, who you're targeting, and just have these little spots to add all of these demographics to add a little more emphasis, which a lot of these brand boards don't have that piece. I really do think that's something that everybody should have. You should be able to have a section that you can just drop these all in there.\
\
[00:32:37.370] - Liz\
That's fantastic. Definitely go grab that, guys. I think you have something in the Speaker Bonus Bundle as well, correct?\
\
[00:32:43.460] - Dan\
Yes. Now that is going to be more like the big set of the concepts. I'll add another worksheet in there, which will be just a downloadable PDF that does the same flow into that, but it's going to add a lot more of the questions that I would ask when it comes to doing branding itself, because it's wonderful to know all of these things. And if they're just sitting in a tab on your notes or somewhere outside of a Google Doc that you can share and they're just chilling there, no one's going to know about them. So, let's really heavily focus on that piece to know all about your brand, where you're going to go with it, and how it wants to be shown to the audience. Then it's all going to be in this nice little document that you'll have ready to go. You can download the Canva piece, you have this, and then you just tie them together and mirror it all up, and then you have concepts sitting there ready for you to go.\
\
[00:33:36.900] - Liz\
Fantastic. So, if you guys haven't upgraded to get the Speaker Bonus Bundle, definitely do that. Dan, thank you so much. I learned a ton. I'm sure everyone watching this did, too.\
\
[00:33:44.930] - Dan\
Thank you so much, Liz, again. And it was so wonderful to be here, and I hope to talk to you soon.\

**Transcript:**\
[00:00:09.440] - Kara Fidd, simplifyingdiydesign.com\
Hey, everyone, this is Kara from SimplifyingDIYDesign, where I teach bloggers and online business owners how to use design in their business to create social media, graphics, lead magnets, digital products, all sorts of things. So I am super excited to talk to you today about using Canva to create promotional graphics for more sales and sign ups. It does not stop when we finish our lead magnet or our digital product. We have to use visual promotion to get more eyes on that offer.\
\
[00:00:38.510] - Kara\
So before we jump in, I just want to go over what we're going to talk about today.\
\
[00:00:44.780] - Kara\
We're going to talk about the different types of graphics that you can create to promote your products and lead magnets, the different layers of promotion and how to adjust your graphic to save more time and how to create them right inside of Canva. So before we jump in to the actual design part, I want to go over mockups. Mockups are a great way to turn your digital product into something visual. So if it's a course or if it's a workbook or anything like that, that mockup is going to give somebody a visual sense of what your offer is without them even having to really look at it.\
\
[00:01:26.000] - Kara\
So if you can see some examples here, this one is is just a template from my membership. But I think it gives you a good sense of like, this is a notebook, you know what I mean? So if you put your cover on that, that's a mock up of your notebook. You can keep it simple. This is one that I use on my sales page before. It's just kind of showing the different pages of that that workbook.\
\
[00:01:51.260] - Kara\
These are obviously more like courses because we have it on the computer screen. So what you choose to put your product on is going to give people a good sense. You know, computers are great for courses, a notebook binder, even just fanning sheets. That's great for like workbooks and ebooks and things like that. Tablet could also be great for an ebook or even a course or whatever you are creating.\
\
[00:02:16.880] - Kara\
So I do kind of want to show you how to actually create a mockup inside a Canva, because you're going to need that not only on your sales page, not only on your ads, but all of the different designs that you create to promote your offer. You can use your mockup on. OK, so let's jump over to Canva so you can see a couple of examples of how you can lay things out. OK, so say you have a course and you got an e-book or a workbook as a bonus and you have other, you know, checklists and printables and things like that as bonuses.\
\
[00:02:54.020] - Kara\
You can put all of that in one mockup image and you can use these mockups again. You can use them on all of your pins, all of your Facebook posts, your ads, your sales page, whatever you want. It's going to start with this mockup. So I want to show you real quick how you can make that from scratch. Like, these are just examples from templates that I have inside of one of my courses. But you can definitely make these from scratch.\
\
[00:03:18.860] - Kara\
So we're going to go over to elements and I'm sorry, the Loom thing is, is covering that, but it's the elements tab. And I'm going to type in iPad. OK, so you can see there are some options here, but they don't really look realistic. Right. So I'm going to go to photos and I'm going to type in iPad. And now we can see. All right, there are some options here that look really realistic.\
\
[00:03:44.390] - Kara\
OK. You can even see that they have things set up that are already laid out for you. But basically what we want to do is we want to take that iPad or that computer. OK, you can even try to find a woops, a notebook, OK, or binder, see, these ones have like a curved edge, so I probably want to use that.\
\
[00:04:17.450] - Kara\
But you can always take something like this. That's. OK, you know, and there are different things that you can try, you can try Binder. You can try a clipboard. You know, there's there's a lot of different things that you can play with. So anyway, let's jump into this and you can even make yourself a little template. What I'm going to do is I'm going to use these as the basic shape and then I'm going to fill it in with a grid, [inaudible 00:04:54] .\
\
[00:04:54.110] - Kara\
There we go. So you might have to go to position and move it forward. And I'm just going to place it right inside of that space. I just copied and pasted it so that I can use another one and I'm going to copy and paste again. OK. OK, now I want to show you another little trick, because I get asked quite often. No, there's not a great way to create a shadow inside of Canva. But if you go over to my site simplifying DIY design, if you're not already signed up for my free library, you can do so.\
\
[00:05:49.130] - Kara\
You just go to design library, sign up for access. But if you already have the password, you can go ahead and jump in and all the way at the bottom.\
\
[00:05:59.870] - Kara\
So I have lots of free templates, tutorials, resources, checklist, Trello boards of all sorts of things. But one of the thing all the way down at the bottom is shadow to add to printables in Canva. OK, so if you download it and then upload it right to Canva. OK, so I'm going to then hop back over to Canva and I'm going to upload it. Right into my images, so now I have a page that has a nice little shadow to it.\
\
[00:06:42.660] - Kara\
OK. And what you're going to do is you're going to, again, place a, move that forward for, a minute. Place a grid right over that. Now you have a page that has a shadow.\
\
[00:07:11.510] - Kara\
OK, so you're going to drag and drop your page from your product into that little space. OK, I'm going to move to back and then I'm going to copy and paste it and kind of fan it out. OK, so this is how you can just arrange whatever you have to offer in Canva really quickly.\
\
[00:07:33.600] - Kara\
So now what you would do is you would go to your product anywhere, download individual pages from that product as JPEG images. OK, so then you would have you would really upload them to Canva so that you have the pages as images inside of Canva because you cannot upload a PDF. I'm trying to find a good example. OK, so I have my cover here and I could do like a screen here. And let's do just, you know, for time's sake here, see how just drag and drop and now I have a mockup up.\
\
[00:08:23.970] - Kara\
So once you have the mock up the way that you want it to be, you would just go ahead and download it. If you have Canva Pro, you can download it with a transparent background. And I'm just going to click on that one page. So that's all it downloads. And now I have it on my computer so that I can use it on my sales page. I can use it in my promotional designs. I'm going to crop it really quick.\
\
[00:08:54.250] - Kara\
And then I'm going to upload it back in the Canva so we have it to use on our promotional designs.\
\
[00:09:00.340] - Kara\
OK, so now that we covered the mock up, it is kind of the first step of the promotional graphics. So I hope that was a little bit helpful to kind of get that baseline in there. But now I want to talk about the different types of graphics that you can create to promote your product.\
\
[00:09:17.480] - Kara\
So it's not a secret that sometimes people take a lot of exposure to something in order to feel comfortable enough to buy that thing. I think the average is like seven times they have to hear about a product or even about you before they have that desire to actually like really check it out. So kind of being everywhere all at once is a great way to get a lot of different eyes on your offer. So ways you can do that. And again, there are a lot of different layers to promotion, too, and we'll talk about that and how you can adjust these things.\
\
[00:09:56.740] - Kara\
But before we talk about that, I want to talk about those different types of graphics that you can create as your base designs and get your offer out there. So things that you can do are creating pins for your digital product or lead magnet or whatever offer you have. You can do square images for Facebook and Instagram. You can do social media headers. It's so important to have that call to action right in your social media. How you can change your button on Facebook, the Facebook page to go right to your opt in page if you want.\
\
[00:10:30.290] - Kara\
If you have a sale going on, things like that. Update your social media headers to reflect that, offer graphics for your blog. You can add them into your sidebar. You can add images into your blog posts. You can promote your lead magnet's show them a little visual example of what your lead magnet looks like. Add in related digital products that you might have into your blog posts.\
\
[00:10:53.500] - Kara\
A lot of different areas on the blog that we can promote writing in your home page, even if you have an offer that you want to get a lot of eyes on advertisements, of course, not required, but if you are in a place that you are running ads, you can do ads for Facebook, Instagram, you can do promoted pins. And then of course, video content so you can create video pins. You can do stories on Facebook and Pinterest, you, and Instagram, sorry, and IGTV.\
\
[00:11:23.500] - Kara\
Of course, that is the Instagram platform for videos and then of course, Facebook. So there are so many different ways that we can create visual content to promote whatever our offer is. So let's get designing.\
\
[00:11:38.470] - Kara\
I want to hop back over to Canva and show you a little bit of what I'm talking about. So I'm going to do a tutorial about basically how to design a pin using your, using a mockup. OK, so here are a couple of examples, and this is another way you can do it. So if you don't have the ability or want to do something like I showed you before, you can always find an image or, you know, if you have Depositphotos or whatever you use for your stock photos, you can find an image that has something already on it.\
\
[00:12:11.740] - Kara\
So you can see there's a piece of paper and overlay a grid, kind of like I did when I was making the mockups, OK. Same thing goes for a tablet. If we didn't have a tablet and we wanted to look for. Let's see, that's OK. So say we have a desk. OK, and we want to add an iPad to it. And you can do something like that. So now I have the iPad and it looks like it's laying on the desk.\
\
[00:13:05.050] - Kara\
OK, so then you would just add your product cover to it and there you go. You have a mockup that's a little bit different than what we were talking about. These are obviously templates.\
\
[00:13:17.050] - Kara\
I had them in my DIY Design Creator's vault, but they I also have free templates inside of my design library, as I mentioned. So if you're designing this right from scratch, we can do this a lot of different ways. You can see that the all of these are pins are designed with just using shapes and text. So it doesn't have to be very complicated if you're creating a pin or any kind of visual graphic for your blog or for social media.\
\
[00:13:47.170] - Kara\
I usually just start with a square and make a footer, especially for Pinterest. And you can, of course, use your brand colors. The next thing you want to do is add some text and I'm going to put in, OK? That now I want a background, so I have to decide, OK, do I want to do a color background and add my mock up image? You can absolutely do that. You can do patterns if you want, and I already have that.\
\
[00:14:29.280] - Kara\
And uploads should be. And then I'm just using shapes, really. And I'm copying pasting, just use your keyboard shortcuts, control C, control V for paste, OK? And now I want to add my text and you could either just write the name of your product, but I like to kind of give it give an idea of a transformation of what the product actually does. So I'm pretending this is like a lead magnet, it's actually a bonus for one of my courses, but I'm just pretending for the sake of the tutorial, it's a lead magnet and we're going to say free workbooks so you can.\
\
[00:15:45.050] - Kara\
OK, so I give them a result basically in that headline. I'm going to adjust my line high up here because I like my lines pretty close together and then I'm going to use a corner to kind of make it the size that I want. OK, there are a lot of different things that you can do on text and on pins to make the text stand out if you wanted to. You can search different types of text if you want, like a bold text.\
\
[00:16:13.250] - Kara\
I don't really worry too much about staying super on brand when it comes to fonts on my pins.\
\
[00:16:20.450] - Kara\
I try to stay more on brand when it comes to Facebook and things like that. I just want something that's going to fit fit the content the best so you can line up your text just right. I like to use my arrow keys to get things positioned just right. You can change your color to match your brand. You can highlight one word to make it stand out.\
\
[00:16:50.780] - Kara\
OK, I like to use warm color accents on my pins for sure. If it's not in the photo, then I use it on my design. So the same type of idea would go for if we're using a stock photo background.\
\
[00:17:05.540] - Kara\
OK, so we're going to do a desk and let's see. My research notebook, because I want to grab that notebook again. Now, line this up so that it is looking like it's laying on the desk, that the macaroons are on my way here for this one. There we go. OK, so now once I have that adjusted the way that I want to, I'm going to add my image.\
\
[00:17:57.630] - Kara\
You can skip the grid if you want to and just go right to adding your cover to it. The grid is kind of if you're wanting to make a template for yourself. OK, so you can see how I've essentially made a mockup out of that stock photo. There is a paid option as well. I am at my Ecovermaker.com, and if you sign up for an account, you can choose different things as basically a mockup generator. So you'll upload your cover art or whatever you want to upload to any of these things.\
\
[00:18:42.100] - Kara\
And it will generate a an image for you that has a transparent background and it has the cover on it.\
\
[00:18:49.420] - Kara\
There are some free options that you can use if you want to. I mainly use it for the notebook because I just I really like how it looks.\
\
[00:18:59.050] - Kara\
It is a paid tool, like I mentioned, and they're usually $5 each. Or you can sign up for the membership, which is $15 a month. So if I have a lot to make, I'll just I'll sign up for the membership, make as many as I can, and then downgraded it time and again. But you can sign up for a free account. And that's another option as well for your promotional graphics.\
\
[00:19:24.310] - Kara\
OK, so we made a pin and we can obviously then use the resize tool if you're using Canva Pro to create your square graphics, your. I like to do like a horizontal graphic for my blog post so that it doesn't take up a ton of scrolling space. I usually use for that if you type in Facebook ads of those 1200 x 628, that's usually what I use inside of my blog post. Like if it's in the content that I'm like promoting a product that's the size I like.\
\
[00:19:57.670] - Kara\
But of course it's up to you. You can use a square as well so that if somebody tries to pin it, it'll look better on Pinterest. OK, so let's hop back over to our presentation since we just designed a pin. And we're going to talk now about the different types of graphics that you can use in all the different layers. OK, so there are a lot of things to consider when you're doing a promotion. Do you have a prelaunch period?\
\
[00:20:24.520] - Kara\
Do you have an early bird special? Do you have special offers ending? Do you want to create additional graphics for your affiliates to use? Are you doing an affiliate launch like this isn't even your product and you want to be promoting affiliate products that you're an affiliate for graphics, for doors closing. Do you have an open close, you know, offer course or anything that's only open for a short amount of time and doors are closing? These are a lot of different things that you consider and you don't have to.\
\
[00:20:57.790] - Kara\
It sounds like a lot, but you really can repurpose what you created when you have these designs. You can really repurpose them just by changing up what the text says. So now, if I was doing a Facebook ad and I'm going to use the same.\
\
[00:21:24.360] - Kara\
Oh, Instagram story. So if I was doing a Facebook ad now. When doing the original and you're likely going to have something that looks like.\
\
[00:21:50.750] - Kara\
So let's say, ah, we have a special flash sale, k. So I'm going to have the text say flash sale. Get a little bit bigger, but not too bad, because especially if it is a Facebook ad, Facebook doesn't like that. OK, so what am I going to do is say.\
\
[00:23:03.480] - Kara\
OK, so you can see all I'm doing is changing the text, I'm keeping the rest of it the same, you don't have to make a million different graphics. You can easily just adjust what you have. So if you wanted to say, posted on your Instagram and we were starting with this design. I can just grab something from another page or anything like that, or you can change the text that you had in the original image so you can change this text to say something else.\
\
[00:24:14.210] - Kara\
OK, so you can see how we can repurpose what we already have and make a ton of graphics from.\
\
[00:24:20.620] - Kara\
It doesn't have to be super complicated and it's very easy to do right inside of Canva. Now, before I hop off, I want to share with you a little trick, because I really think that this is awesome for promotion of lead magnets, digital products, all these things I use it on a sales page. I use it in Facebook ads. I use it a lot. So I'm going to give you a little glimpse of what it is. OK, so see how everything's moving.\
\
[00:24:56.920] - Kara\
OK, but this is a little different. This is everything staying the same except for what's on the screen. OK, so whether it be an iPad, a notebook, an ebook phone, you can keep everything the same and just flip through the pages of your product. OK, so again, this is an example of how I've used that on the sales page and I'm going to show you how you can do that in Canva for free. You do not need the pro version to do this.\
\
[00:25:27.880] - Kara\
I'm going to. OK, so. I'm going to start with, OK, I want to start with this design, so what you're going to do is if you are designing this from scratch, you're going to want to design one thing first one, one design. Just keep it to one design ,one page. If you're using a template, edit the template the way that you want it. Do not move on until you have one design exactly the way that you want to.\
\
[00:25:58.540] - Kara\
OK, so I'm going to just use this template here. OK, and I have used the template to make a very quick promotional look, and now I'm going to go right into page manager. So if you saw that this is a little button in the middle, says grid view, used to be called page manager, Canva changes things a lot.\
\
[00:26:42.220] - Kara\
And I'm going to duplicate that image however many times I need to.\
\
[00:26:46.570] - Kara\
OK, so you know what? First, I want to add, add a grid because I want all the pages to be exactly in the same spot and then go back to elements and I'm going to go down the grids. Hey, I'm going to turn it. Lay it out exactly how I want the pages of my work book to be. Lined up. OK, now try that again.\
\
[00:27:33.640] - Kara\
So I'm going to duplicate it, so if you want to show off 10 pages, you'll have 10 pages of the same image. If you have three pages again, you'll just have three pages of the image. But just do it as many times as you need and then you're going to go back into your design and you're going to upload those page images. OK, so remember how he said you'll download your product pages as JPEG images and you'll re upload them to Canva.\
\
[00:28:01.760] - Kara\
OK, so I'll have my cover, I'll have my first page, my second page done. OK, so again, if you have 10 pages, just keep on going. Now when we download it, we're going to download it as a gif and we're going to make sure all the pages are selected and click on download. OK, so I'm going to open this up and I'm going to show you what it looks like. Because I think this is so slow and for whatever reason, you inside of Canva, you can't adjust the speed.\
\
[00:28:49.610] - Kara\
So I do have a little workaround for this and it's free. It is called easygif.com/speed. OK, so you're going to upload that image, that gif right inside of there and then click on upload. OK, so now I can see a little preview of what it looks like. And right below that, you're going to see this area here where you can do the percentage of current speed and I'm going to do five hundred and click on Change Speed.\
\
[00:29:23.270] - Kara\
So now you can see it's much faster and you can do it as fast as you want if you want to. Even faster than that, click on Change Speed and it's really fast now. OK, so once you get it the way that you want it, you'll just go ahead and save it. It'll automatically download to your computer. And now if we open that one. You can see that we have a much faster image, so this is the one that you would want to use for your ads or your sales page or wherever you are promoting that product in a visual way.\
\
[00:30:02.190] - Kara\

[00:00:00.170] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
Kara, thank you so much for being a part of the summit. I really appreciate it.\
\
[00:00:04.660] - Kara Fidd\
Thank you so much for having me. I'm super excited.\
\
[00:00:08.770] - Liz\
Yeah, because I first came across you during the Rebel Boss summit. We were both part of that, and I watched your session. I was like, I've been using Canva for years, and I didn't know you could do that.\
\
[00:00:17.460] - Liz\
And I was like, what?\
\
[00:00:21.970] - Kara\
I love finding little hacks and workarounds.\
\
[00:00:25.290] - Liz\
Yes.\
\
[00:00:25.690] - Liz\
And I mean, I've kind of [inaudible 00:00:27] away from using Canva for certain things, but I learned so much, and I was like, I couldn't believe it. So I was really excited when you agreed to do this summit as well. For anyone that doesn't know, this is Kara from Simplifying DIY Design, and she just makes the design stuff for those of us that that's not our area of expertise, super easy. Can you share kind of an overview of what you're going to be covering for us today?\
\
[00:00:49.790] - Kara\
So today I'm going to be talking\
\
[00:00:51.460] - Kara\
about different steps of a funnel. So design is such a big part of all of the different steps of a funnel, and I don't think people realize how much actually goes into it. From creating the freebie to creating the landing page and the actual product itself, there's a lot of design that goes into it. So I just, like, kind of breaking down the different steps that you can take in designing a funnel that really converts, and I'm super excited to talk about it. I could talk about funnels all day and design.\
\
[00:01:20.410] - Liz\
Yeah, I can't wait to see your presentation. So, let's go ahead and dive in.\
\
[00:01:25.370] - Kara\
Hey, everyone. Thank you so much for joining me today. I am so excited to talk about funnels that convert. So really quick before we get started, about me. I'm a mom of two awesome kids. I'm a military spouse, certified in graphic design, a full-time blogger, and owner of Simplifying DIY Design. And I specialize in combining my knowledge of marketing with design concepts to help people create better graphics and digital products for their blogs. Templates are my jam. I love creating them, and I love seeing what people are able to create with them. So, what we're going to talk about today is the nine essential steps of creating a funnel that converts, why it's important, and how to maximize value and conversions every single step of the way using visual techniques. So first, the first step is usually the entry point. So as you can see in the video here, that'll just kind of loop. Somebody's going to find you via a social media platform nine times out of ten. Unless they're finding you on Google, there's some kind of image that's getting them into the first step of your funnel. So they type in whatever they're looking for.\
\
[00:02:34.610] - Kara\
They see your image, it grabs their attention, they click through to your blog. So that's kind of how they're entering the first step of your funnel. So whether it be a blog post or lead magnet page, anything like that, most of the time it's going to start with some kind of visual graphic. And that means you want to make sure that every single post that you have, every single lead magnet you have, all have their own graphics for each of the social media platforms, especially when it comes to Facebook and Pinterest, and when it comes time to running ads. You don't always just want to run it right to a blog post, you sometimes want to run it to a lead magnet. It depends on what you're doing, but most of the time the entry point is some kind of visual. So some tips to kind of maximize those clicks or entry into your funnel is using really attractive photos. If you aren't very good at taking your own photos, you might want to invest in some beautiful stock photos. The image in the actual photograph itself can make a big difference, so you want it to be light, bright, crisp, and clear.\
\
[00:03:46.890] - Kara\
And if you're not really great at taking pictures, it might be something you want to invest in. Keep each platform in mind. So big, bold, readable text works awesome on Pinterest, but Facebook doesn't really like it, so they prefer very little or no text. I like to have at least some text in my Facebook, depending on what it is. If it's a blog post, I might not do any text at all. You can also test out different titles, and this is really important, especially on Pinterest. You can make several different pins with different titles. You're going to want them to be very similar so that you're actually delivering on the promise of the title, but you can kind of change up the words and restructure the title a little bit. It's kind of just how many times can I say the same thing kind of game. So if you test different titles, you never really know what's going to take off. So, I highly recommend kind of experimenting with different ways that you can phrase your title to get it to be more clickable. Keep your ideal reader in mind when choosing the design elements of your image.\
\
[00:04:56.580] - Kara\
So, if you are geared towards parents of kids, you might want to find photos and other design elements that are appropriate to that person. If you have a more professional brand, again, it's something that you want to keep in mind when you're choosing the visual aspects of any image. Remember, design is just as much about communication as actual verbal language. So you want to make sure that your images that you use are relevant to the content and the transformation that you're promising. A lot of these platforms, especially Pinterest, they can tell what the content is based on the image. So, if the image is confusing, it's not going to keyword properly, and you might not get shown in as much search results as you're hoping. If you struggle with this stuff, using a template can be a great professional jumping-off point. It can save a ton of time and help you kind of start with a professional design, and then it's very easy to customize to your brand. So the next step of the funnel is going to be the actual lead magnet, and this is where we're going to try to capture that person and convert them into a consistent reader.\
\
[00:06:12.050] - Kara\
Somebody that comes back to our site, that follows us and reads our emails, and grows to know, like, and trust us. So, this is where we want to give them a lot of value, give them a quick win, and get them on our email list. You can do this really easily design-wise, using free programs. You don't have to use anything fancy. I like, Canva. I also use Adobe InDesign, but choose the platform that you feel comfortable with because what really matters is that it's done and out there. Set it up with your email service provider so that when somebody fills out the form, they put their name and email address, and it gets delivered to them automatically. So, tips for generating a lead magnet idea, try not to overthink it. It doesn't have to be super complicated. So a couple of things to think about when you're trying to generate that lead magnet idea is what problem does your paid offer solve? So if you have a paid offer or some kind of product, you can kind of work backwards from that and try to think about the problem that the paid offer solves. And then think about the first steps, the roadblocks, the questions, concerns, things like that, that somebody is going to have about your paid offer or even just your topic in general.\
\
[00:07:26.300] - Kara\
So where does my reader need to be in order to know that they even have this problem? Maybe somebody doesn't even know that they have the problem. They need some education first. What kind of information do they need prior to being ready to get that problem solved? So again, even if you don't have a paid offer, you can think about the general problem that your avatar or ideal audience has and kind of work backward from that as well. What's another problem they might have before being ready for the paid offer that I can solve? Okay, so that would be kind of like first steps. If you don't have a paid offer, again, you can think about your most popular posts. How can you expand on them? You can think about the problems your ideal reader has and how you can provide quick wins for them. So these are things I would just make a brainstorm list, start listing out all the different things. Consider your top posts, your top topics that get a lot of traffic and sign-ups already. Start there. Use that as a jumping-off point to create a lead magnet idea that will attract the right person.\
\
[00:08:33.560] - Kara\
So, it's all about attracting a very specific person that's going to be our avatar, okay? Now, the opt-in page and the opt-in form are going to be those entry points to your actual email list. So whether it be a dedicated page like you see right here, or a form on your website, whether it be your sidebar, your blog post, your footer, wherever you have that form, you want to be promoting that opt-in. Okay? So this would be the next step. You're going to want to create a form or create a page that you can send people to. Okay? So, you can also see in this video, I have a dedicated page, but I put visual images in my sidebar so that somebody clicks on them, they go over to the page. Okay? So, if they landed on a post that maybe they didn't connect with the lead magnet in the post, but the one in the sidebar grabs their attention, that's another way to do it. You want to make it as easy as humanly possible for someone to opt into your email list. So, some tips for this to maximize those sign-ups is to create an irresistible headline.\
\
[00:09:40.880] - Kara\
You want to be able to describe that freebie and grab their attention, promise a transformation, and really sell that freebie. No, it's not something that's going to make you money immediately, but it does have a lot of potential to make you money in terms of follow-up products. So, if you're catching the right person that's going to be interested in your paid offers, whether it be a tripwire, an affiliate product, a bigger product that you have, this is an essential step to making sure these people are the right fit. So you want to make sure that you're attracting the right person in your headline. Include visual elements, usually a mockup-style graphic of the lead magnet. You can see on the page here I had a little mockup of the actual planner right here, and I had a couple more on the page itself. You can get as creative as you want. Try not to give away actual content, but make sure they know exactly what it is. And you can do that really easily using a 3D style. Not everybody is super familiar with printables and things like that, but if you can kind of give it a visual, if you can display it in a visual way, it would go a long way with perceived value.\
\
[00:10:56.560] - Kara\
So, ensure the offer itself speaks to the pain points of your ideal audience. This is, again going back to we want to be attracting the right people. It doesn't matter if you think of some amazing lead magnet that gets tons of sign-ups if those aren't the right people for your email list. Okay? So it's all about attracting a specific person. Make sure the button on your opt-in page pops. If it's too blending into your brand colors, then it might not jump off the page as much. So you want to kind of experiment with different copy on the buttons and different colors of the buttons. And lastly, check it on your mobile device. So, this is something that is commonly forgotten, to really double check what your page looks like on a mobile device, especially when running ads of any kind, because people, nine times out of ten, they're searching Facebook and Pinterest on their phone. So, how it looks on your mobile device is going to be important. You're going to want to make sure that form is really close to the top of the page. You don't want them to have to scroll far to get to that form.\
\
[00:12:06.070] - Kara\
All right, so the next step in the funnel is a tripwire. So what this is, it's essentially a low-cost, quick-win type of product that's offered right after someone signs up for your email list. So what's going to happen is they're going to put their information into the form, then they're going to be directed to a thank you page that lets them know that the freebies on the way and offers them a special one-time offer. So again, we can see an example of what one of my tripwire pages looks like. Somebody clicks through, they buy a low-cost offer. Okay? So, what this does is one, if you're running ads, it can help you make that ad money back. So if you're running ads to grow your email list, this is going to be a great way to make that money back. And then that way it's not costing you anything to grow the email list, but you can grow it a lot faster because you're able to invest in those ads. Two, it's qualifying the leads that are coming onto our email list. Okay? So people that purchase the next step of your value ladder, which is basically just a list of your offers in terms of the smallest free offers to your bigger paid offers, and you can have different steps in between.\
\
[00:13:18.900] - Kara\
So, that's what makes it a value ladder. So, we're offering somebody a chance to get a really good discount, or thanking them for trusting us with their email address, we're offering them in exchange a special offer. Okay? So, the people that sign up for that, they are going to be more likely to be repeat customers because we're now going to get the chance to wow them with our paid value. Okay? So, it's qualifying the leads coming onto the email list, and it's also making sure that we're able to kind of promote our business via ads at, hopefully, no cost. Hopefully, we're at least breaking even with this, because then we can move them up the value ladder in our email funnel. Now, if you don't have a tripwire you can still wow them with value on your thank you page. So, if you don't have a tripwire or paid offer yet and you don't feel that you're ready to make one, you can create what I call a value-driven thank you page. So, if I am running ads to warm up for like a launch or a relaunch of some kind, but I don't have a tripwire for that specific product, that's okay because I know that I'm running those ads so that I can retarget the paid product later.\
\
[00:14:41.850] - Kara\
So I'm okay with just sending people to a value-driven thank you page. So, I want to wow them, I want to start building that relationship. And what a value-driven thank you page looks like usually for me, it's thanking the person for signing up. It's giving them the opportunity to connect with me on social platforms. And I also usually try to include a video training of some kind, some kind of another quick win in addition to the lead magnet that they signed up for. So I can just start throwing value at them and letting them know what kind of stuff I talk about, and the type of value that I'm able to deliver. Some tips for the value-driven thank you page like I mentioned before, kind of just doing a short story about yourself and your why. That's kind of establishing a connection, establishing that know, like, and trust for your new subscriber. Include a personal photo of yourself, a headshot, getting somebody familiar with you and what you look like. Include links to your best articles that people might find helpful. Create a favorite resources page that you can link to.\
\
[00:15:50.320] - Kara\
And this is great for education and value for your audience, but also it's a good spot for affiliate links. You can also link your favorite affiliate products directly on the thank you page via a recommendation tile, where they have the little graphics and things like that. And you can talk briefly about which each one is. And again, like I said, I like to link my social media profiles. You can link to your podcast, your YouTube channel, whatever you have going on just so that people are able to connect with you on different platforms. And then you can also, like I suggested, that I do for my value-driven thank you pages, make some kind of value video and embed it on the page. I did mine via Facebook and then that way when somebody watches it, they get put into that re-target audience of people that watch 3 seconds or more of the video. So, the next step in the funnel is going to be our welcome sequence. So, this is where we're going to start nurturing the new subscriber with a value-driven email sequence. So this is usually like two to three days of emails.\
\
[00:16:59.770] - Kara\
I like to include more freebies tips and personal information about myself to again, work on establishing that connection and getting the person to know, like, and trust me. So, now it's time to level this up. If you've gotten all of the steps up to this point, so you've got your freebie, your tripwire, you should at least be starting to generate some money with that, which is awesome. But now it's time to take it to the next step, and this is where we're going to come up with an actual product. Digital products are the way to go. They are amazing. You can monetize with affiliate products, but I have never been as successful with affiliate products as I have been with my own digital products. Everybody is different. Everyone's site is different. It can be different for you. This is what works for me and this is what I'm teaching with my topic, product design. So I love digital products and you're really just spending your time to make them. And then the beauty is that you can sell them over and over and over again without having to do much more work. I mean, you do have to put in some effort to keep your product updated and deal with customer service issues and things like that, but you're in control of all of it.\
\
[00:18:18.270] - Kara\
Unlike affiliate products, you are in control of the sales page, you're in control of the price, you are in control of whenever you run promotions. You're in control of how you treat your customer after they've purchased from you. You are in so much more of a position to help the audience that you worked really hard to build. So, that's why I'm so passionate about product design. So, once you feel established with an engaged audience that's super targeted, you are ready for product design. You don't need to wait for some magic number. If you feel you're ready, go for it. I like to start by surveying to see how my audience learns best, what types of products they like to purchase, that kind of thing. What have they tried before? What didn't work for them? Why didn't it work for them? This is a lot of information that is helpful when it comes down to trying to plan out how we're going to solve this problem for them. So, again, some tips, things to ask yourself to generate that winning product idea. What are your people already asking for? What is the problem they need solved?\
\
[00:19:24.670] - Kara\
Why does it even matter to them that the problem gets solved? What types of things has your audience tried before? Why did it work? Why didn't it work? How can you improve it and make that better? And how can you get them over the roadblock that they're experiencing and get them to that final destination, that transformation, the place that they want to be? We're not talking like earth shattering, solve world hunger types of problems. It can be as simple as how can you get someone to finally stick to the meal plan. Whatever your audience is struggling with, you can find a unique way to solve it for them. Even if the idea itself has been done a million times before, no one's going to do it your way, and no one's going to present it the way that you would, okay? So don't put yourself down that, oh, well, I can't make a menu plan or whatever because it's been done a million times before. But maybe the way that you present it in your strategy for it is different enough where the person would actually see success, even though they tried it a million times before.\
\
[00:20:33.530] - Kara\
So, here's what I like to do when it actually comes down to designing it. Okay? So, before I even start designing, before I even open my computer well, I do have to open the computer to write it out, but before I open Canva or InDesign or whatever design program I'm using, I want the content written out. I like to also do an inspiration session. So, I like to go on Pinterest, Creative Market, things like that, and type in the idea, the topic, the type of product, and just start getting ideas for design, for presentation, for promotion ideas, and keep them in like a Trello board or whatever you use for organization. I like Trello. I use it for everything. This is not meant ever to copy somebody, but it's just meant to kind of get the creative wheel spinning. Okay? So, we can look at layouts and we can look at colors, and we can look at - okay, a lot of people are designing it this way. Maybe I don't want to do it that way, I want mine to stand out. We could take notes of what we like, what we don't like, why we like and don't like it.\
\
[00:21:43.350] - Kara\
It's a really good way to get the wheel spinning. So then, I'm going to map out my product on paper. So, I'm going to take out a paper, I'm going to take out a pencil with an eraser and start kind of mapping out where I want things to be. And that way, when I go over to Canva or InDesign or whatever, I have something to refer to. So I can just copy and paste the stuff that I've written out, put it into my design program, and lay it out the way that it is on my paper. It makes it so much easier. So, you can even do that. I use my own templates all the time, actually, because I've already designed it so I might as well. Saves a lot of time. But I still like to do this because then I can choose the template that I need that has the closest jumping-off point, and I can start there, and I cut out a lot of that process. I also want to make a decision before jumping into this about the colors and the fonts that I'm going to use and they're usually on brand.\
\
[00:22:42.670] - Kara\
The only time I've ever really gone off brand for a digital product of any kind has been a seasonal product. I like to choose the colors that go along with the season that I'm creating content for. So usually it's red and green, but I like the shades of the colors to be pretty complementary with my brand. So, I usually start with my brand colors and kind of tweak them until they get to where I want them to be. So then, the next step of your funnel is going to be actually creating the sales page design. So, once you've gotten your product, set up, created, and launched, it's time to automate those sales with the funnel. You can add the sales sequence to the end of your welcome value email. So, somebody has gone through your welcome sequence, you've established a connection. Hopefully, you've gotten them to reply to you. Maybe you started a dialog, you've helped them with something, a question, anything like that. You're starting to develop that relationship, and now we want to move them up that value ladder. So, we're going to offer them this next product. That's why you want to kind of create a separate sales page for that.\
\
[00:23:54.990] - Kara\
So, what I do with the sales page is, one, it has a unique code so I know that the people using the code either to get a discount or to get bonuses, that's specific to the email sequence. So, I know that they're coming in from the email sequence. So, sales are generated from that email sequence, and that way I'm able to calculate the conversions and work on it that way. So, I want this sales page to be completely separate from what somebody would see if they just went over to my teachable shop. Okay? Some visual elements you might want to include to increase conversions with that sales page is including stock photos, beautiful photos. Either it kind of visually represents the transformation. It can visually represent frustration, pain points, things like that. You can include product mockup images like we discussed with the lead magnets. Countdown timers are good. I always use a countdown timer for my tripwire sales pages. You can do testimonial graphics, videos. I love including videos on my sales pages. And it's not always just me talking at somebody. Sometimes I'm giving them a sneak peek of what the actual product is and things like that.\
\
[00:25:13.890] - Kara\
You can do a personal photo headshot, any other graphic that you might want to include. So, if you're offering a special offer, like a discount or a flash sale of some kind, you can include the graphic that'll say, 'Oh, special offer for new subscribers', or 'Special limited time offer', 'Special discount', that kind of thing. And then, when you run live flash sales or you're relaunching, stuff like that, you can kind of make a duplicate of that sales page and then swap out the graphics. So, it kind of saves time with all the other things that you'll need to do. So next, we're going to have the actual sales sequence. So, this is going to be added to the end of that value email so that we can automate those sales to be happening on a routine basis. Okay? So, you can experiment with what works for you. Maybe you want to offer a discount, maybe you want to offer exclusive bonuses. I do recommend that you have some kind of urgency. So, if you want to offer them a discount for a couple of days, if you want to offer them bonuses, that kind of thing, that's going to go away after a certain time is done,\
\
[00:26:23.450] - Kara\
you can do it that way. Always remember to continue providing value. Educate the person why this product is going to make a difference for them. Address any objections. Give people incentive to buy. Okay? Now, the last step is an optional step. You don't have to do it, but I do find this works really well on my funnel sales. Okay? So, what I do after I offer that product to the email list, the new person has now signed up for a freebie, they've been introduced to a tripwire, they've gone through a value sequence, and now they've been offered a product. If they buy that product, I have another product that I will offer them for a steep discount as a thank you for buying that previous product. It's usually highly related or a next best step. So, it's going to want to be something that makes sense to the person that they'll be like, 'Oh yeah, that's awesome, that's a great deal, I'll definitely grab it'. Maybe they were thinking about that they wanted it in the first place and now they get shown this offer for 50% off or whatever kind of incentive you want to give them to buy on that page, they're going to be super excited about that.\
\
[00:27:44.300] - Kara\
So, I do find that using the platforms that have one click upsell, like Teachable or Podia, where they give you the option to add an upsell to the confirmation page, that does not convert as well as actually redirecting someone to a dedicated upsell page. My dedicated upsell page looks very much like a tripwire page, just a little bit longer depending on the size of the product. It's going to have a countdown timer that redirects away from the page when the offer is expired. And I'm also going to include this button at the bottom that's going to continue them to their purchase. So, if they don't want to buy it, that's fine, but I don't want to make it really difficult for them to get into the product that they already purchased either. So, I'll just include that button at the bottom. If they've decided to purchase it, that's great. They've gone up another level in your value ladder. They've gotten a deal and you've gotten more income. So, if you've noticed that between the lead magnet design, the image, the entry point image designs, the product designs, all of that stuff, even the sales page design, design is a major common denominator in all of the different steps of a funnel.\
\
[00:29:03.150] - Kara\
So is product creation. So, again, that lead magnet, that tripwire, that product all falls under product creation. And I do have a free Product Creators Quickstart kit for everybody that watches this presentation, and Elizabeth is going to share with you how you can grab that for free.

[00:00:10.060] - Liz Stapleton, Summit Host\
All right, guys, I'm super excited for today's session with Kate Danielle, who is a Canva master. I was looking at her blog recently and I was like, I didn't know I could do that. And I've been using Canva for like five years. So, Kate, thank you so much for being here. I really appreciate it.\
\
[00:00:25.060] - Kate Danielle, katedanielle.com\
Yes. Thank you so much for having me.\
\
[00:00:27.890] - Liz\
Yeah. So why don't you give us just a really quick little background of how you gotten the Canva, because Canva actually hasn't been around that long. I think it's 2013?\
\
[00:00:37.990] - Kate\
Right? Yeah.\
\
[00:00:39.700] - Kate\
Yeah. So I kind of stumbled into it. I, I was in graphic design and you know, it's very big into Adobe and the Adobe tools, but they are, they're a beast of a system.\
\
[00:00:58.750] - Kate\
And I was, you know, several years ago, probably around 2014, I was creating my first graphics kit for bloggers and I was in a group of business ladies. And I asked them, I said, what? What is this Canva and why? I knew what it was, but I was like, why are you paying for this software when you could get Photoshop for the same price? And they kind of they explained it to me.\
\
[00:01:29.690] - Kate\
They're like, "we do a million things. And this helps streamline our process." And I don't want to learn Photoshop and it was just a huge eye opener for me, so I pivoted because I learned that my target was not in Photoshop, they were using Canva and so I started creating things for Canva, learning more about it. And then I was invited to be one of their certified creatives. And I'm just dived in I spend way more time in Canva than any other design platform, and it's such a great tool.\
\
[00:02:08.970] - Liz\
Yeah. And so you brought up streamlining. Right. And so one of my biggest struggles, I've had Canva a long time, is keeping it organized. Right. Because I have, I literally I started blogging in 2014. I initially started Photoshop and I was like, this is freaking hard and I hate it. And I eventually did Canva I go back and forth between Canva and Google slides now. But one of my biggest issues and it could have been because there wasn't organization tools that are in there now is keeping stuff organized and trying to constantly find what I had worked on previously.\
\
[00:02:41.840] - Liz\
Go find that logo I made or whatever. So what are some tips you have to stay organized? Whether you're on Canva Free or Canva Pro so that you actually can streamline, have a process.\
\
[00:02:55.300] - Kate\
It is a definitely a little bit harder to find things in the free version, to my knowledge. And I always have to to go and check and see. I can do that right now.\
\
[00:03:07.990] - Kate\
You can't search for your own designs in the free version and but you do get two folders.\
\
[00:03:16.000] - Kate\
So let me just make sure that I'm speaking correctly.\
\
[00:03:22.690] - Kate\
I believe when you search in the free version, it's only going to bring up their templates. Yeah, you can't search for your own designs because typically, I would say naming your stuff appropriately is very important. And that is true in Canva Pro. If you name your stuff and come up with a naming system that you can remember, then you can search for it. Because if you notice on that Canva home screen. It's in chronological order when you go into your designs.\
\
[00:03:51.580] - Kate\
So in Pro name things, you can utilize folders in pro and with Pro, then I would just recommend staying out of that all design area. It's been suggested to Canva to kind of make that process, like if it's a folder to clean up that area, because even if you put it in a folder, they're still there. So just save your sanity and stay out of there. Of course I don't. I get so unorganized with trainings and leave things and don't know what, but I know how to be organized.\
\
[00:04:24.310] - Kate\
In the free version, I would suggest batch designing in the same Canva workspace. So say if you were designing Pin for your blog, maybe you have, one set for that month or even that quarter, depending on how many you do, and you just keep designing them, one under the other. So you're not having 50 different pin that you're trying to scroll and find in that section, and then you can utilize the two free folders you get in the free version.\
\
[00:04:57.240] - Liz\
So what is a naming system you would recommend?\
\
[00:05:01.410] - Kate\
I typically, I go back and forth between one and name it for the size or the platform. So like a Pin or IG for Instagram and Facebook, which pretty much now I use the Facebook and Instagram interchangeably and I have used just doing Q1, Q2. And then sometimes maybe I'll just say October 2020 Kate's Pins, and if you happen to work with other brands, put your name in it too or your business name. So I have to do that for myself or I will lose all my stuff and be searching for, you know,\
\
[00:05:41.130] - Liz\
the client things and stuff. OK, gotcha. So. That's kind of organization, so would you mind kind of sharing your screen and let's talk about sort of a good work flow of creating, you know, whether it's Pin or just sort of the best way to do that sort of the system and workflow you find to be the most productive? Because my biggest issue is how long Canava takes, which is why I do jump to Google Slides sometimes because it's just easy, I can automate more there...\
\
[00:06:14.050] - Kate\
Yeah, yeah.\
\
[00:06:15.570] - Kate\
So when you come into Canva, you come to this, your main Canva homescreen here, the very first thing I tell anyone is to one have branding in Canva so have set colors and fonts already decided and you can even set that up in the free version just by utilizing templates. So let me pull up one of mine. So this is a template set that I copied over and when I say templates, I mean anything that you previously created or you can buy or use Canva's, but I'm not saying necessarily go in and pull some of these right here.\
\
[00:07:14.590] - Kate\
I'm saying have stuff set up already with your brand colors and fonts. So then when you are creating a Pin, all you have to do is change the title. And then of course, if it's, if I'm using like creative elements that swap those out or if I don't have a photo, but if it was a photo, then you just swap out the photo.\
\
[00:07:35.720] - Kate\
So that saves so much time. And so this is a set that I've actually copied and I've only utilized the first Pin. So then I may come in and redo this one for whatever I needed to market next, or especially with Pinterest, maybe you're going to make five pins for the same post or opt in and you just kind of reusing and you're just making small tweaks if you already have the preliminary work set up for you.\
\
[00:08:06.670] - Liz\
But it's key to actually make a copy so you don't lose the designs you did previously.\
\
[00:08:13.370] - Kate\
Yeah, so if I, if it's something I still need, which I have Canva Pro, so I would delete stuff off my computer and leave it here since I can search for it. But maybe if you're on the free version when you download your graphics, maybe you want to keep them organized in a file on your computer because it's easier for you to find them again. But say I might use this Pin again, so then I could just duplicate it, make a copy right under it and keep going.\
\
[00:08:47.130] - Kate\
I can also go up to file and make a\
\
[00:08:50.290] - Liz\
Copy of the entire thing\
\
[00:08:52.540] - Kate\
and it'll open up a whole new tab for you and then you just rename it Go from there.\
\
[00:08:58.000] - Liz\
Gotcha.\
\
[00:08:59.320] - Liz\
And I know, so I know you can do this. I haven't actually done it though. But you can connect to Dropbox and like Giphy?\
\
[00:09:06.200] - Kate\
Yes.\
\
[00:09:07.000] - Liz\
Because all my stuff is in Dropbox.\
\
[00:09:07.430] - Kate\
So because, Giphy is super fun. It is all the way you see mine's here, but it's that's not natively there. You find it under the more tab and it usually shows up. But if it doesn't, you can search for things, OK, and it just basically opens up the Giphy search. So what happens when you search for something and add it, so I'll just pick one.\
\
[00:09:37.330] - Kate\
It's actually uploading it into your Canva, which I didn't even, it took me a minute to realize this.\
\
[00:09:43.210] - Kate\
So if you come to your uploads and over to video,\
\
[00:09:47.500] - Liz\
Is it like you're the ones to use all the time?\
\
[00:09:50.320] - Kate\
Yes, it will save em, you see I have lots of...\
\
[00:09:52.270] - Liz\
Nice.\
\
[00:09:52.600] - Kate\
these. So if you ever download your design with a gif and it's not working, chances are you just might have had a slow connection and it hasn't fully uploaded yet. Dropbox, I love, it does the same thing, though. So I've recently started utilizing the Dropbox feature. Again, you find that under "more" and you'll have to connect it.\
\
[00:10:17.130] - Liz\
Ooo, you can do Google drive too. Oh\
\
[00:10:18.790] - Kate\
Yes. And Google Drive.\
\
[00:10:20.120] - Kate\
So what happens, but I love this, because you can search for folders. So I was a member of Social Curator for a while and so, I have... I've uploaded all of the photos that I got in that membership.\
\
[00:10:46.780] - Liz\
This is where, like your naming system, has to be real solid, right,\
\
[00:10:49.660] - Kate\
yes.\
\
[00:10:49.660] - Liz\
We all. This is where, like, if you're a beginner blogger, like, learn from our mistakes.\
\
[00:10:55.870] - Kate\
Yes. For some reason it's not. Maybe.. Show more. There we go. So it opens up all of those stock photos and this works the same way. So typically, what I should do is after I use one...\
\
[00:11:11.810] - Liz\
That's still so much easier than having to open up a folder, you know, and then drag it into upload or whatever.\
\
[00:11:21.070] - Kate\
Yeah. And it's working on uploading. So if I wanted to keep this clean, I could just come back and delete it out of my uploads. But yeah, with Canva pro. You get lots of storage, but I didn't want to take the chance of uploading a bunch of high res photos that I may never use.\
\
[00:11:37.750] - Kate\
So I like just accessing them through Dropbox or Google Drive or...\
\
[00:11:44.370] - Liz\
There's all sorts of stuff.\
\
[00:11:45.610] - Kate\
Yeah. And you can search there's a whole list of...\
\
[00:11:48.520] - Liz\
Oh wow.\
\
[00:11:49.420] - Kate\
Things there and let me...\
\
[00:11:50.800] - Liz\
I like didn't even know that was there.\
\
[00:11:52.540] - Kate\
Can you see.\
\
[00:11:54.250] - Liz\
Yes I can.\
\
[00:11:55.340] - Kate\
OK, I like to log in to a demo free version,\
\
[00:12:02.390] - Liz\
OK.\
\
[00:12:03.010] - Kate\
So that I'm not saying something that might not be true. So yeah it looks like you have all the same features here in this, it'll ask you to connect. So it looks like the free version of Canva has the same.\
\
[00:12:19.030] - Liz\
Ok and Youtube, wow.\
\
[00:12:22.150] - Kate\
Yeah. And I think you can even bring in Facebook photos, which. I don't know that those would be great quality, but,\
\
[00:12:29.720] - Liz\
yeah,\
\
[00:12:30.370] - Kate\
you could.\
\
[00:12:31.510] - Liz\
OK, so another sort of, because templates are great and templates, even just stuff you previously design. But there are so many template packs out there right, like you buy a template. So everyone's got like a free template often. Whatever. How do you keep that organized? So because I was actually I thought I'd saved them all templates. It turns out I didn't. And it was very confusing for me to figure out, OK, how do I get these so they're in the template section so I can find them?\
\
[00:13:01.310] - Liz\
And keep that organized. I don't know if you have some advice on that?\
\
[00:13:05.060] - Kate\
So, like, if you're purchasing and putting them in your account?\
\
[00:13:10.130] - Liz\
Yeah, because it'll be like, you know, it's like, oh, they shared this template with you, do you want to use it and it goes, yes, but it just goes into your designs typically then?\
\
[00:13:18.590] - Kate\
Yeah. So what I would do in that case, again, if you're on Canva Pro you can make an unlimited. Don't want to say it's unlimited, but I'm not sure..\
\
[00:13:30.720] - Liz\
Tons of folders.\
\
[00:13:30.760] - Kate\
Tons of folders so you could have a template folder. And what I always suggest is you get a set of templates. So let's just say that these were.\
\
[00:13:46.190] - Kate\
(the zoom bar is in my way.) Let's just say that these are the templates, oops where did they go. That you had purchased. So what I would do is, it ugh, clicking all kinds of wrong things. It might say like KateDanielle Template or whoever you got them from.\
\
[00:14:08.400] - Liz\
Yeah.\
\
[00:14:08.750] - Kate\
And so I would maybe add "Master" to the front if you wanted to keep an unedited version and then you could put that in a folder if you have it, or just leave it at that.\
\
[00:14:22.730] - Kate\
And then you can make when you make a copy, click, "make a copy", it's going to pop open again. It always puts a copy of the name.\
\
[00:14:32.000] - Kate\
Yeah. So you could say why "your copy here", "your blog name", "your business name" change it so you know that these are the ones that you are editing. That's what I try to do when I'm behaving. But if you are to look through my account, you would see lots of things that say "Copy of copy of copy". I think I've counted like six.\
\
[00:14:53.120] - Liz\
I'm terrible about updating the name.\
\
[00:14:55.790] - Kate\
Yeah. And if you start from scratch, a lot of times it pulls in random text or text,\
\
[00:15:02.750] - Liz\
Yes!\
\
[00:15:02.750] - Kate\
So it's good, good to get in the habit of naming things.\
\
[00:15:09.670] - Liz\
I have so many that are just untitled.\
\
[00:15:11.530] - Kate\
Yeah, and and even on the free version, because you never know that you may decide you need some pro features eventually, so go ahead and get your naming down.\
\
[00:15:23.920] - Liz\
Well, I think even if you can't search through Canva, you could probably do like a control find on the page.\
\
[00:15:28.870] - Kate\
You probably could.\
\
[00:15:29.940] - Kate\
Yeah. Yeah.\
\
[00:15:33.380] - Liz\
OK, so then the other question, I don't know if you have an answer to is so especially Pinterest in the whole fresh pin thing and creating multiple Pins that are very different looking or different looking is constantly having to copy and paste the title in different ways. Is there an easy way to do that, that I'm just unaware of? Or....\
\
[00:15:57.880] - Kate\
There's a yeah, there's not an easy way to like do the title in different ways other than....\
\
[00:16:05.020] - Liz\
Just swapping colors and stuff like that's fast enough. Right. But I was just, I was just curious if I was unaware.\
\
[00:16:11.890] - Kate\
Yeah. So what I do.\
\
[00:16:16.660] - Liz\
Like, it's almost like you can change all the colors, like can you change all the words?\
\
[00:16:20.670] - Kate\
You cannot yet what you can do is there is a this little feature. Let me pull up this window to make sure it's there.\
\
[00:16:31.790] - Kate\
There's this little roller brush. And I don't know if this would really help with what you're talking about, but I can copy the style of this one and paste it there.\
\
[00:16:41.510] - Liz\
Oh, OK. So you're not like having to go in and be like, oh, what font was that? And drop that. Right. That actually is a little easier. Yeah.\
\
[00:16:49.250] - Kate\
And I think there's a shortcut for it. Somebody told me the other day. But if you come to that "help window" and search for "shortcuts", it'll pull up a whole menu for you and somewhere, which I'll have to look later. There's a shortcut for that. And the shortcut will actually work over and over. Whereas say I had this just happen to me the other day, I was decided I wanted to change the style of my text on ten pages.\
\
[00:17:18.740] - Kate\
And using that brush, I have to go back and select it every time and paste it again. And apparently the shortcut you can just keep using until you're done, you don't have to keep copying, basically.\
\
[00:17:31.670] - Liz\
All right. What are your favorite shortcuts?\
\
[00:17:35.870] - Kate\
So the one I use probably most often is T for text and that pops in a text box and it tries to predict your font. So sometimes I don't know if I have I may have branding set up or actually no it's pulling in because now that's the only font in this design. It tries to predict what kind of font you're going to use or it'll pull in. Whatever you said is brand font. I use R for rectangle, C for circle.\
\
[00:18:08.140] - Liz\
What?! I didn't know you could do this.\
\
[00:18:08.400] - Kate\
L for line. So those are probably the...\
\
[00:18:16.670] - Liz\
So is it like command L?\
\
[00:18:19.400] - Kate\
No, you just hit the letters.\
\
[00:18:21.010] - Liz\
So what?\
\
[00:18:23.410] - Kate\
Yeah. So they're super....\
\
[00:18:26.480] - Liz\
I have like I just Kara Fidd who was on first because last year, she is speaking again this year, I learned the whole trick of like the arrow to like move stuff just a teeny tiny bit. But I didn't know you could hit the letters!\
\
[00:18:39.050] - Kate\
Yeah. You hit the letters. Another one that is super helpful. So sometimes things like this happen or maybe I... The text is just longer, but I've got that whole rectangle blocked so you can hit tab as long as you have something selected here.\
\
[00:19:00.860] - Kate\
I can hit Tab and it's going to start scrolling through all the elements and typically if you shift tab, it goes in the opposite direction.\
\
[00:19:11.420] - Kate\
So sometimes that helps....\
\
[00:19:13.730] - Liz\
Based on the layering.\
\
[00:19:15.230] - Kate\
And yeah, you go through the layering without having to totally move everything.\
\
[00:19:20.630] - Liz\
Yeah,\
\
[00:19:21.740] - Kate\
But yeah, it's super kind of cool just to go through here because you'll learn. Ones that you may use often, grouping elements, I don't, I don't actually use that one very often, but, you know, you kind of just get into a flow.\
\
[00:19:38.660] - Liz\
Yeah.\
\
[00:19:39.380] - Kate\
Of things you would use.\
\
[00:19:43.130] - Liz\
Yeah. Because I always have to go on and find, like the rectangle or the circle...\
\
[00:19:49.280] - Kate\
Yeah, they save so much time and especially the dropping in a text box.\
\
[00:19:54.990] - Liz\
Yeah.\
\
[00:19:59.400] - Liz\
Woah! Mind blown a little bit here, so so I know this is only a feature that's available on Pro. I'm curious your thoughts on it, the resize feature, which I haven't used in a long time. Is it worth it? Because, I mean, the last time I used it, I feel like it pulls in all the elements. Then I still have to resize everything.\
\
[00:20:22.170] - Kate\
Right.\
\
[00:20:26.230] - Liz\
So I'm just curious,\
\
[00:20:27.460] - Kate\
To be super honest, that was that is that is not the reason, I would tell anyone to upgrade to pro. There's so many other awesome things, I do know. We'll see what happens.\
\
[00:20:40.990] - Liz\
It's almost better to do the resize once or something and then edit it and then just use whichever file.\
\
[00:20:46.370] - Kate\
Yeah. I do know that they have been working on this maybe a little bit, so we'll see what happens. Just looks like normal because you can always copy and paste.\
\
[00:21:00.370] - Liz\
Yeah, that's what I've always like. It's almost just easier to copy and paste\
\
[00:21:04.300] - Kate\
Same everything and you still have to. And then either way you have to kind of adjust everything. So yeah, the only down, the only thing that's different is obviously you saw there's checkboxes. So I could check, I could check three.\
\
[00:21:22.600] - Liz\
Yeah.\
\
[00:21:23.320] - Kate\
But then it kind of gets overwhelming in my opinion, because then you have three more tabs that all say copy of.\
\
[00:21:30.860] - Liz\
Yeah.\
\
[00:21:31.290] - Kate\
So the magic resize it. Yeah. That's not one of the selling points just in my opinion.\
\
[00:21:40.450] - Liz\
Yeah. I think for me because I go back and forth between having a pro account and having a free account based on what's going on.\
\
[00:21:47.200] - Kate\
Yeah.\
\
[00:21:48.160] - Liz\
But I think having the branding colors in the fonts in there and being able to do multiple brands and stuff is is key for me. I wish I could have like multiple brand font chunks, but I don't think that's possible yet. And then, but that I think just saves you so much time rather than trying to like constantly use something that has your colors in there or whatnot.\
\
[00:22:11.590] - Kate\
Right.\
\
[00:22:16.210] - Liz\
OK, so those are some great shortcuts and workflow I, I do love to copy and paste from previous things, that, I use that all the time.\
\
[00:22:26.260] - Kate\
Yes, actually in Canva Pro, I just remembered one thing you can pull in your designs here so you can either do it from a folder or you can go into all designs, which is a little crazy. So maybe I needed to make a Pin out of this and then it just opens up.\
\
[00:22:53.860] - Kate\
So it's similar to copy and paste. And again, you can only do that in Canva pro, but that is a quick way to without having to open several different tabs.\
\
[00:23:02.360] - Liz\
Yes, I think I'd do that to just elements. But I think I just I just learned you can save an element that you've. Or you can "heart" it or something?\
\
[00:23:12.170] - Kate\
Yes, and they've actually added this is fairly new, it came out this month that when you...\
\
[00:23:19.370] - Liz\
We are recording this a little while before the Summit. So it may not be that new.\
\
[00:23:23.810] - Kate\
So in October, they added the little eye button. So if you click on anything like an element or a photo, it will give you the information and you can add it. You can "heart" it, which adds it to your likes. So in your free version.\
\
[00:23:47.030] - Kate\
You get to do that and the folder was there, but I believe it's not. Oh, it looks like you can actually add.\
\
[00:23:55.040] - Kate\
So that is also something that you can add them to your one of your two folders and yes, then you just find that in your little folders tab and there's everything I liked. It's also super great. So maybe you wanted something similar. It gives you the keywords in the name and you can actually click on these. But I find it better to combine a few of them, depending on what you're looking for in the search. So, yeah, that's so helpful, especially if you use something in the past you're trying to find it again for some reason.\
\
[00:24:31.490] - Liz\
Does it save, like when you like it, does it save sort of whatever color you chose?\
\
[00:24:38.910] - Kate\
I don't think so. I think it's just going to be back to its, back to its default.\
\
[00:24:49.860] - Liz\
Just curious. I mean, that still helps, right. Yeah, saves you from having to go find things. Which can take a lot of time.\
\
[00:25:00.930] - Kate\
Oh, yeah, sometimes the key words are not that, you know, when you're searching for thing,\
\
[00:25:07.200] - Liz\
I mean its a graphic design tool, right? It's not a search engine.\
\
[00:25:09.650] - Kate\
Right. Mm hmm.\
\
[00:25:14.100] - Liz\
Any sort of final tips or tricks or things you think people should know to make their life easier when it comes to creating, particularly in Canva, but just in general too.\
\
[00:25:28.620] - Kate\
To not overcomplicate it, I think, and. Now, more than ever, we're getting to just simpler is better, a lot of the stuff that we're creating is viewed on phones.\
\
[00:25:45.790] - Kate\
And I even pulled up my Instagram account because I tend to want to jazz everything up and put on my graphic design spin on it, but really just these big, bold words or quotes like that may have even been. Too much, too little. It was a different style graphic, but, you know, just the bigger, bolder, easy to read, we don't have to put all the flourishes ever on it.\
\
[00:26:17.260] - Liz\
I always like to zoom out in Canva.\
\
[00:26:18.970] - Kate\
Yes,\
\
[00:26:20.170] - Liz\
So I create, and then I zoom out to make sure I can still read it for whatever, because it's going to be smaller than a phone,\
\
[00:26:27.850] - Kate\
Right. Exactly. Yeah, that is the biggest thing. And just go ahead and get colors in to Canva. So I use a little color drop tool of a chrome extension. Yeah. Mine is colorZillah. So you can pull any color from anywhere. Of course these are already in my Canva account.\
\
[00:26:17.260] - Kate\
It gives you the code to then paste it in your color so you can paste it in here and it will pop up or in your brand section on Canva pro. So that's just so important. And to stick with them, it's it's a fun. At least I think it's fun to play with colors and fonts all day long, but that's....\
\
[00:27:11.560] - Liz\
It can become such a time suck.\
\
[00:27:13.150] - Kate\
Yes. And it's one of those I feel busy to tasks, but are you really being productive?\
\
[00:27:19.180] - Liz\
There's a difference between, busy and being productive.\
\
[00:27:21.370] - Kate\
Yes. Mm hmm. Yeah.\
\
[00:27:24.070] - Liz\
All right.\
\
[00:27:24.730] - Kate\
There's so much fun stuff to play around with in Canva and we talked a little bit about the magic resize, but there's so many. Last year, Canva added that all elements and photos are available in Canva Pro.\
\
[00:27:38.770] - Liz\
I mean, it's there there's a lot of benefits, Canva work. There's, you know, the elements and the photos. But there's also just the organizational aspect, the like. There's a huge list. Resize wouldn't necessarily be the reason I would recommend for someone, but there's a ton of other reasons, I would, like the multiple branding for different things the like. Right now I'm like blanking on the different things that Canva for work comes with.\
\
[00:28:07.670] - Kate\
Yeah,\
\
[00:28:08.440] - Liz\
like I'm not an affiliate, I'm just, you know, I definitely like I do use Google slides, but I there's a time and place I use Canva too because I just there's stuff I can do with it that I can't do easily elsewhere.\
\
[00:28:21.940] - Kate\
And there are definitely a few hacks to get around. Some of these like to copy and paste for the resize.\
\
[00:28:29.440] - Kate\
And yeah,\
\
[00:28:32.260] - Liz\
The background remover is awesome to at some really cool features that make life a lot easier, especially if you compare it to if you've ever had to try to learn Photoshop.\
\
[00:28:43.340] - Kate\
Yes. So it's it's definitely it's my most used tool.\
\
[00:28:47.830] - Kate\
They. Yeah, I'm just. Yeah, it's great the getting to use a gif here that I pulled in. Yeah. So it's so much fun, explore with these tabs, their animations are great, you really can go....\
\
[00:29:06.990] - Liz\
It's come so far in the last couple of years,\
\
[00:29:09.540] - Kate\
They are really wonderful, wonderful company about listening to feedback.\
\
[00:29:14.130] - Kate\
I know in the past two, maybe even three years, they've changed a lot, but they are, they, they listen, they put stuff out and they listen to the feedback and then they make improvements. So it's just wonderful and it's a great tool. I mean, their mission is to help everyone be able to design and it really serves that purpose.\
\
[00:29:41.070] - Liz\
Yeah. Okay. So wrapping up, where can people learn more about you? Do you have anything you want to send them to that would be helpful?\
\
[00:29:55.030] - Kate\
Yes, so you can people can find me at KateDanielle.Com.\

**Transcript:**\
[00:00:12.610] - Liz\
Alright, guys. I know I say this about every speaker, but I'm super excited for our speaker in this session because this is not her first time in the summit. And the last time she was here, she blew my mind with stuff I didn't know you could do in Canva and tips that I still use to this day. Kate Danielle helps creative entrepreneurs, virtual assistants, and online businesses up level their designs with DIY design tools, Canva training, and resources. She is a Canva champion, Canva ambassador, and loves to create easy to use templates and share simple but effective design tips. Kate, welcome.\
\
[00:00:46.310] - Kate\
Thank you. Thank you for having me back. I'm excited to be here. We'll have to chat about all things Canva.\
\
[00:00:53.700] - Liz\
Yes. Okay. So, for those that don't know, obviously, Canva is a great design tool and we're going to be talking today about designing printable products in Canva, which I think I mean, you can do so much in Canva, but that's where we're going to focus on first today. How do you decide kind of what you're going to create? Any tips?\
\
[00:01:17.510] - Kate\
So, I mean printables can be anything, so it ultimately depends on what your blog is about and what your audience wants. So, it can be, maybe you're going to make like an opt in, a content upgrade of some blog posts. So, you're going to make a really nice PDF that maybe has a little more information, or you're going to make an entire product which is like a workbook or a planner and things like that. So, it's really just kind of what you're already talking about and what your audience would want to see from you.\
\
[00:01:53.220] - Liz\
Okay. So, Canva is a great tool, but it can also be a lot I think it's a lot more user-friendly than something like you know Photoshop. But how you kind of get started, there's so many templates, there's so many different size things, you could do custom. Like where should people start if they want to create a printable product in Canva?\
\
[00:02:15.000] - Kate\
I typically start with just the US letter size. So, it doesn't have to be that if you're just going to make a PDF that is mainly going to be viewed on someone's computer. But when we're talking about printables in general, you want to make it the size that people can print at home, so the US eight and a half by eleven size is where I typically start. It can be, there's several things that size, I pick flyer, letterhead, whatever, anything that's that size in Canva and you choose to create a design.\
\
[00:02:47.360] - Liz\
I don't know if you could share your screen and kind of maybe walk us through some tips because you know depending on what you're doing, it could take a long time or a little time. And there's always ways to speed that up.\
\
[00:03:00.190] - Kate\
Oh, yeah.\
\
[00:03:00.500] - Liz\
If you can kind of just show us some tips and sort of ways to make creating printables easier and faster in Canva.\
\
[00:03:07.890] - Kate\
Okay, I'm going to, let's say share my screen. And here in Canva, like I said, I just go to create a design up here, find, sometimes it pops up, but if not, I'll search for flyer. Just something that I know is going to be that eight and a half by eleven. And of course today as I'm on a demo, I get this weird like half-page size popping up and then landscape which I never use. So, I'm going to go US letter document. Things are always changing in Canva, always improving. But you can be surprised sometimes when you come back and you're like, oh, something different. And then right off the bat you have templates that pop up. So, this is going to, of course, depend on what you're creating. You can search if you like. We see lots of sign up sheets, it looks like, I'm not sure, I guess it thinks these are what I need based off what I've been working on. But you could search for a planner and things like that and go ahead and pop stuff in and start editing it that way. And it's going to be a fast process if you're wanting to create a freebie or something like that.\
\
[00:04:30.070] - Kate\
If you're creating a product to sell, I like to kind of start more from scratch or more from commercial use templates outside of Canva. Canva can be at times a bit unclear about their licensing, so that's not any legal. That is just my preference.\
\
[00:04:53.290] - Liz\
Yes. I do have an entire blog post on Canva's terms that I'll link to, just explaining it.\
\
[00:05:00.260] - Kate\
Perfect. Perfect. And I'm in the Canva ambassador and still I feel like we're always like what, when they start getting into their licensing. So, I tend to start from scratch or like I said, a commercial use template and it's just going to depend on what you're creating and the purpose. So, if you are creating something that you know your audience is going to want to print out to use, you need to think about if it's going to take a lot of ink and if they're going to mind. So, sometimes if people are in love planners, I love planners and they're buying ones because they're creative and pretty well, they're likely not going to mind that it uses a lot of ink. But if this is more of like a specific tool type planner, like maybe you teach something on your blog and you have this planner for planning blog content, then they may care a little bit more and make it more simplified. So that's the first decision that you want to make. And then I typically will start by determining what kind of headers and footers I'm going to have because those are going to be things that are probably going to stay the same or be very similar from page to page.\
\
[00:06:24.760] - Kate\
So that's kind of getting a general layout. So, I might start with just like a very simple rectangle, which I hit R on a keyboard to drop this in. This is the fun new shapes tool.\
\
[00:06:39.490] - Liz\
Yes. And that was a tip, actually. I think the last time you did that was like my blown. I use it all the time now.\
\
[00:06:44.910] - Kate\
Yes, and it's gotten even better because now I'll get into it. But you can choose all these shapes. You can make this just an outline. So maybe we wanted a really simple header with a word in the middle. There's no longer this need to go find out the outline shape and doing all the hacks and making it really skinny. You can do this now with the shape tool, you can make this border as thick or thin as you want, and then you could hop your headline right in the middle there. And that's why we're on the shape tool. Another reason why I love it. If you're going to make any kind of checklist, checkboxes, you could go ahead and format this. And I tend to make them small and skinny, but I'm just going to go quick for the demo. So say you have a whole checklist, but you want to change up how they look. You could just go, maybe you wanted circles instead of squares and it changes them all.\
\
[00:07:52.860] - Liz\
Yeah, I didn't know you could do that. That's awesome. Okay. All right. So, the shape tool. Fantastic. I know sometimes you like, are kind of copying and pasting and duplicating, and stuff gets, and you're trying to line things up Canva come a long way in making that easier. I don't know if you would maybe show that bit because I think that helps hugely when you're creating grids or graphs or whatever or checklists even.\
\
[00:08:23.210] - Kate\
So, I'll go ahead. So, this was going to be a checklist that I had on a planner type page or even just any separate things. I'm going to select them all. I call this rubber band selecting, where I just click and drag the things that I want. And then you're going to come up here. You're going to find the position tool. A lot of times, tools get hidden under the three dots. If this panel is open, but you can close it and it pops up, or you can just click on the three dots. In this right here, we're going to look at space evenly vertically, and it's going to make sure that there's an even amount of space between all of them and they're already centered up vertically, or else it would not be grayed out. I'll just do it one more time, make it more noticeable. So, now I can center it. And you can also try the tidy up tool, which kind of does all of it, but I typically, I either just space evenly center things. And then once you do that, you're going to group it. And you'll likely have lines or text here, and you would want to group that too.\
\
[00:09:37.300] - Kate\
And I just go group. So, now you can move it all around. You know, it's spaced evenly. And if you wanted to change your page, you could. And let me just pull up, pull up a planner. So, here, I've done it with, I've actually used tables to make these lines, which I can show you. But I've selected all these and used the position tool. The reason why I use tables on this one is because I'm a really big fan of thin thin lines. And for whatever reason, on just the regular line, I can't get half a pixel thickness, like, I can here. You can't select more than one table. That's the downside. You have to do them easily, one at a time. But I've set this to just half a pixel, and it makes it really thin and really nice in the way I like it. You can do that with rectangles, too, but you can't, as you see in this table, which is sort of a newer feature.\
\
[00:11:02.570] - Liz\
Just where to put in a line, which I think it doesn't like, do a half pixel. Okay.\
\
[00:11:07.370] - Kate\
Right. And with the tables, I can take off. So, I've only made it have top and bottom borders by selecting those there. That was just extra because I happen to open this and see it. But yeah, the same thing here. I've made these and I positioned them all horizontally this time. And you can group them together. And then with something like this, so we'll look at my calendar. These are two page spreads. With something like this, what I do is I lay out the first month, and these serve as my master pages. So, when I go and do the next month, I'm just going to hold shift, so I can select both of these. I duplicate those pages, and then I'll go ahead and do it. And I'll put them right next to it. And you can move them, drag them where they need to go, and then I just go in and make the edits, change these to the right month, shift the dates around the way they need to be. But that way, you know I had already decided this is what the title, the month was going to look like. The box is going to be here.\
\
[00:12:29.600] - Kate\
So, essentially, this is my header and the style I'm going for. And I try to just rinse and repeat as much as possible to make the whole process go faster.\
\
[00:12:38.660] - Liz\
Okay, I have two questions. One is, so when you do calendars, because trying to do the numbers, are you just using a text box that you have set in the corner? Is there some trick to it?\
\
[00:12:53.710] - Kate\
Yeah. So, with these, these calendars are using the new table feature. Let me insert a blank page and I'll show you. You can find the tables under elements. Scroll down. They have some pre-populated designs, but I just picked the first one. I set it up. I add however, they're a little wonky to work with. You can't just say I want it five by seven. You have to go add each column, make sure you've selected it all, size everything equally. And then sometimes you have to come look in this top one. But once you get it set, I did here this three by five, I think, or six. Then you could type in these in tables. But I just don't love it. You see it's there in the middle? I can't get it up in the corner. So, I've just inserted text box to make my numbers. And then what I do is once I get three in a row, I select them and I'm just holding shift to select more than one rather than\
\
[00:14:15.530] - Liz\
Yeah, but [crosstalk 00:14:16]. Yes.\
\
[00:14:17.600] - Kate\
Yeah, and then I just hold alt and drag it down. I'm still holding alt and if I add shift, it keeps it all. I can't move it easily out of line. And then I just put it where I need it and then I type in the new numbers.\
\
[00:14:37.810] - Liz\
Okay. I don't think I need it.\
\
[00:14:40.280] - Kate\
So, it seems like a lot and other big programs have tools you can add on to populate it, but there is still just as much formatting. And when I really thought about it, I was like, there are only twelve months. Yeah, so you can just start with one.\
\
[00:14:59.490] - Liz\
Knowing keyboard shortcuts really speeds things up because I mean I know some of them. I'm learning some new ones from you now. Is there a place where people can find all the shortcuts to kind of study them, if you will?\
\
[00:15:13.940] - Kate\
Yes. If you click on this question mark in the bottom right, you can search for shortcuts and it'll pop up keyboard shortcuts and you have an entire menu. And it can be a little overwhelming. Like I talked about last time, these are the ones I use all the time. T for text, R for rectangle. Or as we saw, you can get any shape, L for line, C for circle. And then I always have to search for other ones that I need. And even though it takes some time, then you're likely remember it for that work session and it will help you a lot.\
\
[00:15:58.910] - Liz\
And some of them transfer like command K applies, like in Google Docs. So, you know, some of them, once you start digging into and getting used to them, you'll see them work on other sites. Not all right, but some are kind of pretty standard.\
\
[00:16:14.190] - Kate\
And like the command C and command V for copy, paste.\
\
[00:16:18.480] - Liz\
Yes.\
\
[00:16:23.150] - Kate\
And then just click the X to get to make it go away.\
\
[00:16:27.280] - Liz\
Okay. So, once you've kind of, I don't know if you have any final tips on sort of creating the printable, and then I've got a question for you. \
\
[00:16:37.430] - Kate\
Sure, yeah. So, I'll delete this out. There's a few more things to keep in mind when it comes to these. I tend to like a very clean workspace, but at times I have to turn on my rulers. And the rulers, what you can see, I have tons of guides. They let you drag these guides in. So, I do that one, so I can be mindful of print margins and that I can keep everything lined up. So, for example, this is a little more in-depth design that is to go in like a disc bound planner. So, I had to be very mindful that. On the pages where they meet in the middle, I needed larger margins. So, I have a line for that. So, then when I come down and what needed to start something else that's there. I can keep these margins. And it takes a lot of, something this in-depth takes some time to really look and go, okay, this is going to be a middle, oh, well, I got an extra page, but this is going to be the middle. And I have larger margins, and then I have a skinnier margin, so I really use rulers a lot.\
\
[00:18:00.040] - Kate\
It can get messy, so then you can just go and hide them when you want to see it clean, but just be mindful of that. Keep everything kind of off the very edge, unless the purpose is to do a bleed off the edge. But unfortunately, a lot of home printers won't necessarily, there will still be a little bit of a white edge around it, and then just go from there. If you ever, the rulers help so much, I used to use rectangles as little placements to make sure things were lined up, and I would delete them later. So, definitely, make sure to turn those off and on as you need them. And then another thing you can do is lock things in place. And the lock feature has actually been updated as well. So, I know that my month is not ever going to move, but I'm likely going to need to edit the month on the next layout. So, if you hit it once, it locks it in place, but I can still type versus if I hit it twice, it's locked and I can't do anything to it. And this is a really useful feature.\
\
[00:19:23.520] - Kate\
You'll know when you need it, because there are sometimes when you'll find you're trying to do something, you're trying to work with frames like these, and things just keep popping in the wrong place or you keep moving something you don't need to move, use the lock.\
\
[00:19:40.480] - Liz\
Yeah, I'm like thinking of as I'm putting together the workbook for the Summit, how much that would be helpful. So, yes, okay. So, once you've got your principal ready to go, what is the best way, in your opinion, to export it from Canva, so that it can be delivered to your subscribers, customers, whatever? What is your kind of preferred file format? Any specific settings when you download?\
\
[00:20:10.780] - Kate\
So, I go to click share, find your download, and I come in here and if I'm printing it, it's pretty kind of self-explanatory in here. If I'm going to print it, I pick PDF print. If this is something that is a PDF that is not going to be printed. So, for example, a lot of times if I'm sharing templates, I make a PDF to share that link. I'm going to pick PDF standard. It tells you it's best for emailing. Now if this was something that you're going to use, say on a tablet, like in Good Notes or something, I'm still going to go with PDF prints, still with the highest quality. And I actually have not done that yet because I have used InDesign for the last digital planner I did. But now I solely like make things in here. But I would compare because anything digital, you still want it to be high quality, but you don't want it to lag. So, if you're making a digital planner, I would start with PDF print. And if you're getting a lag, try the standard. Now the last thing is that when you want to make promo images for your printable, you need to download them as PNG.\
\
[00:21:35.040] - Kate\
So, then you can reupload them into Canva to make any of your promo graphics. You can upload PDF now, but when you, that's going to be for editing purposes. And again, I think it's still in beta and it can be a bit wonky. So, download, I always download them as PNG's as well.\
\
[00:21:57.130] - Liz\
Okay, I like it. And that's super helpful. So, a lot of times when you're making something printable, and we say printable like you're going to print it, but it may be something you know on an iPad or just, you know, a fillable PDF. I've always used other tools to make my PDF fillable. Is that still the best way to do it? Is Canva coming around to that? Do you know?\
\
[00:22:23.600] - Kate\
I haven't heard. Canva doesn't do that as of yet. Canva Docs is on the horizon, but I don't think that means that there's going to be a fillable feature yet. They're comparing it, I guess to Google Docs.\
\
[00:22:41.610] - Liz\
Yeah, which I think will be super helpful because when you're creating like an ebook or something, you, alwaysthe text gets cut off, and then you've got it. So, I have signed up for that beta, right?\
\
[00:22:51.710] - Kate\
Yeah, So, I'm hoping for a lot of things with that. So making it syllable is not something on the horizon that I've heard of. When it comes to things like these digital planners that you see people using on tablets, you don't have to do anything special. They can take that PDF and put it in. I know. For apple. It's good notes. I'm certain there is a similar app for Windows tablets that are, just let you write right on any PDF. If you're wanting people to be able to type and fill it in on a computer, you are going to have to use an outside tool. In the past, I've used the paid version of Adobe Acrobat to create fields and that just you would be, you're essentially drawing active text box wherever you need it to be. And you can Google there are typically free tools available that will do that. It's just been a while since I've used one and they tend to come and go. So, just search for like a fillable PDF maker and it might take you some looking around because you're going to find a lot of things that are like to make contracts, but you just need anything that lets you make little text box in active areas.\
\
[00:24:16.510] - Liz\
Yeah, I think I generally use PDF Escape, which has a free and a paid version, and so, yeah. Okay. So, any kind of final tips for people that are wanting to create you know printables in Canva? Where can they find you, all the things?\
\
[00:24:37.030] - Kate\
So, I would say just get started thinking about what it is you want to create and how creative you want it to be. You can see here I have a very simplified planner design, but if you wanted to make this. So, for example, I've done some holiday-themed planners recently, so if you're going with something that has a specific look to it, go ahead and start searching in the elements for things that you might want to use. So, you might search holiday watercolor and you'll get some ideas. I tend to click just on graphics when it comes to things like this. And you can hart things and put things in certain folders for later use. But I like to just have a blank page that I'm going to add to because you'll see, you get these magic recommendations. And it's great because it's going to show you similar things. So. I might want to use these berries and this flowers, kind of the similar style and this wreath. And that's a really good way to get a collection of graphics you might want to add to your printable. And they can also be very simple. So, if you're not making a planner, you can just have, hit t for a text box.\
\
[00:26:07.250] - Kate\
I don't know why it's not. Now [inaudible 00:26:10] is going to glitch out. It normally works. It's worked at any other time. \
\
[00:26:17.680] - Liz\
It does. I will attest to that. Sometimes, it just, yeah.\
\
[00:26:22.550] - Kate\
Yeah. I don't know what's going on. But you can add text and just have your logo or your business name up here and just kind of format whatever it is, the information you need to provide nicely. It does not have to be overly complicated. Now, if you do want to create some planner type products to sell, you can go grab, I have a free set at KateDanielle.com/freebies, and you can get started with those, use them as is or make them your own.\
\
[00:26:52.850] - Liz\
Awesome. Definitely, go check that out. Kate always delivers on the things, like, it's fantastic. And again, thank you so much for being here. And if you guys have questions, comment below. Kate, thanks again.\
\
[00:27:08.840] - Kate\
Yeah, thank you. And feel free to reach out, because I know when I get in, there, just anything you want to do. The blinders go on and you're like, oh, look at this idea. And this is neat, too. So, if you have any questions about anything, feel free to reach out to me. And thank you so much for having me.\

**Transcript:**\
[00:00:12.990] - Kristin\
Hello, hello, everybody. My name is Kristen Rappaport and I am the founder of KristenRappaport.com and the Brand Boss Design Club, where I help online entrepreneurs better manage the design side of their businesses. I teach on tons of topics including DIY branding, graphic design basics, and of course, all things Canva. I am a graphic designer by trade and I have been designing for what seems like forever.\
\
[00:00:40.960] - Kristin\
I think I'm pushing 20 years now. I've designed for ad agencies, inhouse marketing departments, and clients across the United States. But what I am most passionate about is designing for my very own online business. I've always known that branding and graphic design are crazy important for making your mark in the online space. But it wasn't until I started my own business did I realize how powerful it truly was.\
\
[00:01:05.760] - Kristin\
You see, when you are your own designer, you are in so much more control of every single thing that you do to run your online business. Plus, hiring a designer can be really expensive, which means that you're left to figure it all out on your own and you have no other choice than to put your DIY designer hat on and make stuff happen. You're probably aware that every single thing that you do to grow your blog or online business involves some level of graphic creation. People are visual creatures. We first see with our eyes before we even consider reading anything, which means that your online presence and what your graphics look like matters a lot.\
\
[00:01:44.770] - Kristin\
Over the last couple of years of designing for my own business, I've boiled it down to three key factors that have the most impact in your online presence, and those are your brand image for creating consistent graphics quickly, graphic design skills, so the graphics that you are creating actually look professional and mastering your design program. If I had to guess, I would say that most of you who are here watching this training right now are using Canva. In fact, if you're a Canva user, go ahead and drop your favorite emoji in the chat right now. I know firsthand how incredibly overwhelming Canva can be regardless if you're just getting started or you've been using the app for some time now.\
\
[00:02:25.620] - Kristin\
You probably have hundreds of designs that you've created, multiple design files for your Instagram graphics or your Pinterest pins and whatever other graphics you're creating to market your content. You probably have a ton of old templates that you've downloaded a long time ago that are collecting digital dust bunnies and tons of images uploaded to your Canva app. You know, you have a lot of assets, but for some reason, you can never find anything you're looking for. You end up recreating designs over and over and over again, and you're spending tons of time creating graphics that should really only take you 15 minutes. Maybe when you open your Canva account, you're so overwhelmed that you don't even know where to start.\
\
[00:03:02.950] - Kristin\
Your Canva account is a hot mess, isn't it? If your Canva organization could use a little or a lot of TLC, give me a heck yes in the chat right now. I just want to be clear. This is nothing to feel bad about. You haven't done anything wrong.\
\
[00:03:17.980] - Kristin\
Unfortunately, it's way too easy to let your Canva account get a bit out of control when you're creating magic and working in the margins of your time to make it happen. And the best part is is that it's totally fixable. And I'm going to let you in on a little secret that just may change the way that you design in Canva forever. Organization is everything when it comes to streamlining your design process and maximizing your time spent designing. When your Canva count is in tiptop shape, you're going to save yourself tons of time designing.\
\
[00:03:50.440] - Kristin\
You'll always be able to find exactly what you're looking for, be it a specific design document or an element or stock photo. Your graphics are going to be much more consistent and you're going to have so much more confidence as you create them. Simply put, an organized Canva account can streamline your entire design workflow. And I don't know about you, but I don't have hours to waste fiddling around in Canva looking for that template, searching for that stock photo, or recreating designs. So, what are we waiting for?\
\
[00:04:21.310] - Kristin\
Let's jump into it. Organizing your Canva account can be broken down into five easy-to-follow steps that will transform your hot mess account and nonexistent design process into a streamlined system that will save you tons of time and make you feel like a total brand boss. Before we actually jump into the training, I want to share with you my biggest Canva tip. And if you leave with one golden nugget from this training, let it be this. When you open Canva, I want you to stay far, far away from the dreaded Canva home screen.\
\
[00:04:55.000] - Kristin\
This right here is the Canva home screen. This is what you see when you open your Canva account. And while you have all of your recent designs down here in the bottom, it is really, really hard to find anything that you're looking for if you are searching through these designs. When you jump into Canva, the first place that I want you to go is over here in the projects tab.\
\
[00:05:16.260] - Kristin\
This is a much more organized view of everything inside of your Canva account. From here, you can see all of your folders, all of your designs, all of your templates, all of the images that you've uploaded, and all of the videos that you've uploaded. Once you go through the five-step process that I'm going to be sharing with you today, this is going to make so much more sense. You are going to realize that this is your home base. When you are in the projects view, you'll have access to all of the folders that you're going to be creating, and you're going to be able to locate any designs or elements that you're looking for super quick.\
\
[00:05:50.350] - Kristin\
The first step in organizing your Canva account is to set up your brand kit. The brand kit is a Canva Pro feature only, but to me, this feature alone makes the small investment of Canva Pro totally worth it. To set up your brand kit in Canva, you're going to want to click over here in the left hand where it says, Brand. You're going to be brought to a page that looks like this. When you're setting up your brand kit, you want to make sure that you have all of your different logos uploaded.\
\
[00:06:16.590] - Kristin\
I even like to have white versions in case I want to use them on a dark background. You want to add all of your brand colors right here into this section. You can simply just click the plus button and drop in the hex code of your color. You don't want to add your brand colors in the order that you want them to be displayed because you're not going to be able to move them around afterwards.\
\
[00:06:37.000] - Kristin\
So, for example, I have my core brand colors over here, followed by my dark and light neutrals, and then my action color, which is this bright yellow. I also add in some tints of my colors because sometimes I need a lighter version of a specific color. You're also going to want to set your brand fonts over here in this area. And Canva has tons of fonts to choose from, but you can also upload a font, maybe you downloaded from another website or purchased someplace else.\
\
[00:07:04.510] - Kristin\
When you're pairing fonts, you do need to make sure that they go well together and that they have the same overall vibe and tone of your brand. I like to pair a bolder headline font with a font with a little bit more personality, like a script or a handwritten font, but this is going to be different depending on your own unique brand and business.\
\
[00:07:22.620] - Kristin\
Setting up your brand kit is going to make your fonts easily accessible from this left menu. Anytime you need to add text to your document, your color palette will also be displayed in the left panel, ensuring you stay on brand every single time. Once you have your brand kit set up, your fonts determined, all of your colors in the color palette area, the next step is to clean up your design. So, if you're anything like me, you probably have hundreds of designs floating around in your Canva account.\
\
[00:07:55.080] - Kristin\
They're all scattered about, and all of these designs need a home, so you can find them and repurpose them if needed to save yourself some time designing. So, let's pop back over to the projects tab. Remember, this is going to be your home base, not the Canva home screen, and this is where you can locate all of the designs that you've ever created. There are two views here. What you're seeing now is the grid view, and what I like about this is that the designs are bigger and easier to see.\
\
[00:08:26.640] - Kristin\
And you can also hover over any of your designs to see all of the pages that are in that design to get a better idea of what it is. If you want to view all of your designs in the list view, just click this little button up here to view it as a list. And when you're in either of these views, all of your designs are organized by the date you created them or last access them. So, if I scroll all the way down, you will see that this last design file was created one year ago. Occasionally, they will be out of order, and I'm not quite sure why this is.\
\
[00:09:01.450] - Kristin\
It might be because this design was a template that was shared with me. But in general, all of your designs are going to be organized from the date you created them or last access them. You can use either of these views, whatever works best for you. When you're cleaning up your designs, I recommend that you start at the very bottom of the list or grid view, since these are going to be the oldest designs in your account.\
\
[00:09:27.300] - Kristin\
From here, you can begin deleting designs that you no longer need or use. Maybe you've rebranded, or it's a graphic for something that you no longer use. Maybe they contain outdated information, or maybe it's just a terrible graphic that you have always been ashamed of. You can delete documents one by one by clicking into these three dots over here on the right hand side. And then click move to trash.\
\
[00:09:51.540] - Kristin\
If there are multiple designs that you want to delete, you can select multiple. And then right down here at the bottom, you're going to see this trash icon appear. So, just click move to trash. All of the designs that you move to the trash will live inside your Canva trash can for 30 days. Another key part of cleaning up your designs is renaming your designs.\
\
[00:10:14.070] - Kristin\
Because all of your designs in Canva are actually searchable. Oftentimes, if you create a design, by default, canva will just name it Untitled Design, which is not helpful at all, especially when you're looking for something specific. So, you'll want to go through and name all of your designs, something that you would search for. So, for example, if it's a Pinterest pin file, name it Pinterest pins, Facebook ads, lead magnet, etc. To rename a design, click the pencil icon and change it to whatever you like.\
\
[00:10:45.870] - Kristin\
Anytime you're looking for a specific document, we'll use Pinterest, for example, all of your designs that have the word Pinterest in them will show up in your search results. Additionally, any folders that contain that term will appear in the results as well. If you want to take this a step further. You may also want to pop into your design documents and delete any pages inside them that you no longer need.\
\
[00:11:10.770] - Kristin\
As you are deleting and renaming your designs. Keep a mental note about what types of designs you often create, almost like categories. This is going to help you later when it's time to plan up and set up your folder system, because all of your designs will eventually find their way into a folder. Once your designs are all tied up, it's time to do the same thing for your upload. This can be a little bit time consuming, depending on how often you upload your own assets to Canva.\
\
[00:11:39.870] - Kristin\
And just like your designs, you can see all of the images that you've ever uploaded here in the Images tab. You can view them in a list view, or you can view them in the grid view. The images are also arranged by date, so scroll all the way to the bottom to find your oldest images. This can take a while, especially if you upload a ton of stuff like I do. Once you get to the bottom, you can then start deleting images you no longer need or use.\
\
[00:12:09.810] - Kristin\
To delete image individually, click these three dots over here and then move to trash. To delete multiple images at once, you can select the checkboxes and click the trash icon down here at the bottom of the screen. It's important to know that if you delete an image that is currently used in one of your designs, it will show up as an unlinked file and appear as just a gray box. So, if you're questioning any of your images, it's safer not to delete them. As you're cleaning up, you can also rename your images, but I don't worry too much about renaming them because unlike the design, your images are not searchable from this top search bar up here. But if you think it would be helpful for you, then you can go ahead and rename them.\
\
[00:12:54.190] - Kristin\
While you're digging deep here into your image, do take note of the types of images that you're using often. Maybe you have a lot of stock photos that you use, or maybe you have a lot of images of stuff that you designed to put in a portfolio. Thinking through these things is going to help you plan and create your folder system in the next step. If you have a ton of images that you've uploaded like I do, then this will probably be the most time consuming part. Once you have your images cleaned up, you can do the same thing for any videos that you have uploaded to your Canva account.\
\
[00:13:26.970] - Kristin\
Once your designs and uploads are tied up and you have a much better idea of both the types of designs you create and the types of images or videos you often use in your graphics, it's time for the fun part, which is planning and creating your folder system. And your Canva folder system is an absolute must to keeping your account organized. Folders are searchable and they are really easy to access. You can access all of your folders by going into the folders tab in the projects section of your Canva account. And this is the biggest reason why I recommend that you had here into your projects tab first, when you open up Canva. Because it's all organized and you'll be able to see everything laid out.\
\
[00:14:09.100] - Kristin\
At first glance, this folder system is very similar to a folder system that you might have on your laptop or desktop computer. So, let me tell you a few things about folders. Each folder can contain up to 200 items at the time of this training that was just recently bumped up from 100, which is so great if you've got a ton of stuff in your account to keep organized. You can also create subfolders inside of folders to organize yourself even more. And each folder can contain designs, images, and videos.\
\
[00:14:42.040] - Kristin\
There are three folders that are standard in your Canva account. You're not going to be able to delete these. And those are your purchase folder which will contain anything that you've purchased inside of Canva, your starred folder, which will contain any templates or elements or stock photos that you have starred to possibly use for later, and the uploads folder.\
\
[00:15:03.480] - Kristin\
This uploads folder contains the same items that you're going to find in your images folder and your videos folder. There's no right or wrong way to create your folder system and it will be totally unique to your business and what you're creating. Everybody's brain compartmentalizes things a little bit differently. So, just create a folder system that makes sense to you. And of course, what you're creating in Canva, your folder system is kind of like a living growing thing and you can always create new folders as you need.\
\
[00:15:31.710] - Kristin\
Move folders, put folders inside of folders, and move things from one folder to another. Hopefully, as you are cleaning up your designs and all of your images, you took a note of the types of things that you often create. To create a new folder in your Canva account, go into the folders tab located in the project. Up here in the right-hand corner, click add new, then click create folder.\
\
[00:15:55.470] - Kristin\
Inside this folder, you can create multiple subfolders to organize your account in the way that makes the most sense to you. I'm just naming these folders test for now, but you will want to name these something very intentional because just like your designs, all of your folders are searchable as well. The last step in organizing your Canva account is to actually move your designs and images into the correct folders. We're going to go back over into the projects tab, click into designs.\
\
[00:16:28.360] - Kristin\
I think this is easier in the list view, scroll all the way to the bottom and start moving each design into one of the folders you created. To do that, just click these three buttons move to folder, your projects, search for your folder and drop it into any folder or subfolder. You can do that individually, or you can also select multiple designs, click this folder at the bottom of the page and drop them into their new home. As you move your designs into folders, you'll notice that they are removed from this big, long list of designs, which is great because you know exactly what you have left to organize. Sometimes, you might have some designs that you're not really quite sure where they go, but you can create a miscellaneous or random, whatever you want to call it, folder to drop in the designs to sort later.\
\
[00:17:20.650] - Kristin\
Once you have moved all of your designs, you can then get started on moving your image. If you have a lot of images uploaded to your account, like I do, this could take you just a little bit of time. How you decide to organize your images is totally up to you. Just like all of the designs, once you move an image into a folder, they will be removed from the main list, which is great because you'll know exactly what you have left to organize. Once your Canva account is organized, you may be wondering, okay, Kristin, so how am I actually supposed to use this now?\
\
[00:17:54.510] - Kristin\
So, I'm going to share with you some tips that will maximize your time spent designing, thanks to your organized Canva account. I've already shared this first tip in the beginning of the training, but it's so important that, it's worth sharing again. Make it a habit to go straight into the your projects tab. This is where you're going to see all of your folders, which is going to make it very easy for you to locate what you're looking for. And you're also going to see the recent designs that you've been working on if you need to pop into one and finish something up.\
\
[00:18:23.050] - Kristin\
The next tip is to design in long running documents. For example, I have all of my YouTube thumbnails in one growing document, which makes it super easy to quickly pop in, edit text, change out the stock photo, or create a new design and copy and paste text or elements from designs I've already created. I do the same thing with my Pinterest pins. And doing this makes creating consistent images a lot faster because you're not always starting from scratch. I've already mentioned in this training that your designs and your folders are all searchable in Canva.\
\
[00:19:02.730] - Kristin\
So, even though you may have everything organized in a folder, you might know exactly what you're searching for. And you can head up to the search bar at the top of the menu, type in any search term, and down below, you're going to see all of your designs that contain that term. That's why naming your designs and your folders intentionally is very important. Big tip incoming, the folders icon in the left panel is going to be your very, very best friend.\
\
[00:19:33.430] - Kristin\
When you're inside of any of your design documents, you've probably noticed that you can access templates, elements, uploads, photos, and all kinds of different things in this menu. But this menu is also a great place to keep folders that you use often. For example, if you have a stock photo folder that has all of your on-brand stock images, you can keep that folder over here in the left menu. Just click into it and you're going to see all of the stock photos that you have put inside of that folder. Just click and add it to your document.\
\
[00:20:07.680] - Kristin\
If you use a lot of mockups of your digital products or lead magnets, you can also access any of the designs that are in that folder and simply click to add it to your design. This is great for repurposing things that you have already created instead of recreating them every single time. Another helpful tip to know is that you can actually move and organize images when you're inside a folder in that left panel. For example, if I was looking for some stock photos to use in my Pinterest pins, and I see these images up here that are clearly not stock photos, you can simply click one or multiple images, hover over the three bars, and move them to a different folder right from the left panel. You can move images one by one into a different folder, or you can select multiple and use this folder icon down here to batch move things.\
\
[00:21:03.150] - Kristin\
I know, I know when you are designing in the margins of your time and trying to run your online business or blog, it doesn't take much before your Canva account gets a little out of control. But it's important to keep your account organized. When you're creating new designs, get in the habit of properly naming all of them right away. Name it something that you would search for, so you can find it quickly. Move it directly to its correct folder right after you name it.\
\
[00:21:29.940] - Kristin\
Additionally, you can go into the folder where it will reside and create a new design right inside of this folder. When you're uploading images, properly name anything you upload right away and move it directly to its correct folder after you name it. You can also go into the folder where your images need to reside and upload them directly to this folder. As far as general upkeep goes, make a point to tidy up your account every month or quarter, or even after you finish a big project. Consider your folder system organic.\
\
[00:22:02.380] - Kristin\
You can always move folders around, add new ones, and delete as needed. Over time, you can fine tune your own organizational system and figure out what works best for you. We covered so much in this short training and that taking the time to organize your Canva account can be a tedious process, but it is so worth putting in the time to create a more streamlined and less chaotic design workflow. And I want to make this super simple for everybody watching. So, I'm going to give you access to the Canva Cleanse Workbook, which includes all of the five steps that I've covered in today's training, a checklist for each one of the steps, tips for creating your own Canva folder system, guaranteed ways to keep your account organized, and even an interactive Canva folder planner.\
\
[00:22:49.140] - Kristin\
If you're ready to transform your hot mess of a Canva account, you know, the one where you can't find anything you're looking for into a magical place where you can create all of the graphics that you need to market your blog or business with ease, then grab your workbook. Once you download it, I'm going to be giving you a special opportunity to join me inside of the Brand Boss Design Club, so you can take charge of your visual brand, your graphics, and everything that Canva has to offer.\
\
[00:23:17.790] - Kristin\
Inside the Brand Boss Design Club, you'll get access to tons of visual branding tutorials that will walk you through creating your logo, choosing fonts and colors, and even discovering what makes your blog or business totally unique. There are graphic design trainings on topics like Pinterest pins, social media graphics, lead magnets, mockups and more. I'm always working on adding new content into the memory dashboard.\
\
[00:23:40.330] - Kristin\
On top of that, I host design trainings and design feedback sessions every month, so you can get one-on-one feedback on anything that you're working on. There's even a Facebook community for getting quick feedback on your work. You'll get access to a bunch of Canva templates and even more resources that will have you looking and feeling more professional online. Go grab your workbook and hopefully, I'll see you inside the club. Bye.\

**Transcript:**\
[00:00:12.190] - Kristin Rappaport\
Hello, everyone. Thank you so much for tuning in to the Blogger Breakthrough Summit. I'm truly honored to be here, and a huge shout out to Liz Stapleton for organizing such an inspiring event. It's always so amazing to me to see so many creative minds come together. My name is Kristin Rappaport, and I'm a graphic I'm a designer and founder of the Brand Boss Design Club, where I help online entrepreneurs take creative control of their brand and graphics. I'm here to guide you to that wow feeling and give you the confidence that turns heads and makes your brand unforgettable. I've been designing for a very long time, and it actually all started here in this lovely little program, Printmaster Gold Deluxe. I'll keep this gem forever because it's truly where my love for design began. Since then, I've designed ad agencies, in-house marketing departments, and for clients worldwide. But my favorite project to date has been, hands down, designing for my very own online business, and now teaching others how to do the same. Why? Because a graphic design isn't just a great skill to have in the online space. It can be a total game changer.\
\
[00:01:21.330] - Kristin Rappaport\
You've probably realized by now that just about every single thing you do to market your blog or online business involves some level of graphic design. And if it doesn't, it absolutely should. This is because people are naturally drawn to visuals. Did you know that your viewers make an instant decision whether they like or trust your brand in just seven seconds? And another alarming stat for you, approximately 94% of first impressions about your business are design-related, which means that your brand and graphics matter a lot. That's why I'm here, excited to teach you some simple, effective ways to make the most out of your time spent in Canva. Whether you're a long-time Canva user, or maybe you've just started exploring the magical world of design, I know that it can be pretty overwhelming. With so many tools and features, bells and whistles, you can quickly feel like a little lost kiddo in a candy store, right? But let me let you in on a little secret. It doesn't have to be this way. And that's why I'm so excited that you're tuning in to this training. Today, I'll walk you through how to set up your Canva account for consistent, easy to access branding across every project.\
\
[00:02:29.060] - Kristin Rappaport\
We'll streamline your your design process and boost your efficiency with the magical left panel. And of course, we can't have a Canva training without some super simple designer-level techniques that will elevate your graphics and ensure that you look like the professional you truly are. Are you ready to change the way you design for your business? Let's go.\
\
[00:02:47.950] - Kristin Rappaport\
Canva. It's intriguing but overwhelming, intuitive but easy to get lost in. Can I get a heck yes in the chat if you are lost in Canva? That's probably because you are not using the software wear the right way or in the most efficient way. And you could also use some sleek design technique. So first, let's talk about the setup of your Canva account. When it is set up correctly, you are going to save tons of time designing. You're going to be able to create much more consistent graphics. Stop recreating things and getting lost all the time in Canva. How many times have you been designing a graphic and you're like, Oh my gosh, I feel like I already have done something like this. If I could only just reuse it, why am I recreating things all the You'll have everything you need to create on brand graphics in just a few clicks. And of course, you're going to hopefully feel excited and confident about designing every time you open up Canva. First, I want to talk about setting up your brand kit in Canva and how you can actually use that to your advantage. If you haven't created your visual brand and have something that you absolutely love working with and it's easy to design with, you might have not set up your brand kit.\
\
[00:03:57.620] - Kristin Rappaport\
So once you have all of those important decisions made, you really, really should set up your Canva brand kit. It is the ultimate tool for maintaining brand consistency. It's going to keep everything organized, all of your colors, fonts, logos, all in one place, making it easy to apply your brand's look to any design project. It simplifies your design workflow and ensures consistency across all of your graphics and all of your documents. I want to quickly show you guys where you can find your brand kit and the types of things that you can add to it and some insider thoughts from my designer brain. From the homepage here, you just click into Brand. You need to click into Brand Kit. You can have multiple brand kits, which is really pretty cool. I'm going to go into my brand refresh folder. This here in your brand kit is where you can upload all of your logos variations. You can upload white versions, black versions, all of your different logos that you might use in any of your graphics or collateral. You can also upload your color palette. You just click into one of the circles, drop in the Hex code.\
\
[00:05:00.020] - Kristin Rappaport\
I do recommend that you put these in an order. Your core colors, your neutral colors, and then your action pop a color. That just makes the most sense in my designer brain. You can also add and set your brand fonts. You can set headline font, secondary headline, button text. These can be renamed to better suit your needs. Accent Font, Body Copy. They have option for quote and caption here as well. I do not worry too much about the size of the font because Because depending on the graphic that you're going to be creating, you're going to probably be changing the size of the font anyway. This is also where you can upload fonts. I always recommend checking out websites outside of Canva. My favorite is Creative Market. You can purchase fonts and then you can upload them into Canva here. This is also where you can set your brand voice. Just a hot tip for you guys, one way to do this is to feed ChatGPT all kinds of information about your brand, your business, the vibe and tone that you want to communicate in. You can also copy and paste social media captions or maybe marketing emails that you have sent into a ChatGPT conversation and ask it to analyze your brand voice.\
\
[00:06:12.000] - Kristin Rappaport\
Ask it for a short paragraph, and then paste that into this section. Below the brand voice is where you can add photos, graphics, and icons. You'll notice that I don't have anything in here, but you could add photos, graphics, or icons in here. One thing to note about adding things to this section, these are primarily for things that you are uploading. You cannot put any photos, graphics, icons, elements that are in the Canva element library or photo library into this section of your brand kit. This is basically for anything that you may have purchased or downloaded outside of Canva. Once you have your brand kit set up, I want to just quickly run through how and where you can apply the styles, the colors in any design that you're working on. Anytime you are working with a shape or a background or a font, you see the option up here to change the color. When you have your brand kit set up and your color palette in here, your brand colors are all just a few clicks away. You can add your brand colors to anything very quickly from the left panel here. Brand fonts.\
\
[00:07:19.230] - Kristin Rappaport\
Those are found a couple places. If you're working with text and you go into all of the Canva fonts, there's actually a section in here called 2024 Brand Refresh. So these are all of the fonts that I have set in my brand kit. So they're always easy to access right there. You can also access the fonts. If you click over into the far, far left panel, you can always see all of your fonts right here, and you can just very easily click and add them to your design. This way, you know that whatever project you're working on, your fonts are consistent with what you have decided for your brand image. In that brand kit is also where you have your brand voice. This is like Canva's mini version of AI/ChatGPT. Now, I've got just a text box here. I typed randomly, Importance of brand colors. We can click Generate in this brand voice. We're just going to generate. This is really great for getting your ideas flowing. Maybe you are putting together a lead magnet and you're like, Oh, I need some starter text. You can just type a little prompt in and Canva will write you something based on what you have input for your brand voice.\
\
[00:08:31.530] - Kristin Rappaport\
Here is the output, and then you can add it to your document, resize it, do whatever you need, make it fit in the place that you have. Sometimes I feel like one struggle with design is that you're also not a copywriter. And so it's like, I don't know what to type, I don't know what to write. That's a really great place to get some copy on your design or in your document without being a copywriter. And then, of course, you can tweak and edit it from there. Once you have your brand kit set up, you also have access to your logos, all of your logos, and you can quickly add these to any design that you are working on, resize them, move them, do anything you like. If you had brand photos uploaded into here, you would see them here in this section. Graphics and icons, same with them. And you could just click to add them to your design. So let me know in the chat, are you often using templates? I love templates. I usually recommend them for people who are just getting the hang of design. I also have a love-hate relationship with them.\
\
[00:09:27.930] - Kristin Rappaport\
It's sometimes fitting a a square peg into a round hole. Sometimes you just can't get your content to work. But when you have your brand kit set up, if you click into Design, it's at the very top of that left panel, and go into Style, you can jumpstart any template with your brand fonts and your color palette. So clicking through this color palette will give you some different options, and you can see how everything might look. It's like, Oh, I like that light background, or maybe, I want to go for a bold dark background. You can just shuffle through your color palette here. So brand fonts and colors can be easily and quickly applied to templates. As you begin repurposing more, you're going to find that you need to access your brand kit less and less. Obviously, if you're repurposing, well, things that you created once upon a time are going to be in the correct brand colors and hopefully using your up to date brand fonts. And so as you create more and more graphics that are on brand, you're going to be accessing less and less. So the next The first thing I want to talk about is your folder system.\
\
[00:10:32.960] - Kristin Rappaport\
Canvas folders help you keep your design projects and assets very, very neatly organized. With a free account, you can have two folders, and with a pro account, you can have unlimited folders. When you create your folder system, you can then organize your designs, images into specific folders. You can also create subfolders, and you can quickly locate what you need without sifting through hundreds of designs just to find that one thing that you are looking for. And this will allow you to focus more on creating and less on searching. I want you guys to know there's absolutely no right or wrong way to create your folder system. Everyone's business is different, and even more than that, everybody's brain works a little differently. So your goal is to create a folder system that just makes sense for you and your business needs. The important thing is that you know where you put things and you are able to find them quickly and it makes sense to the needs of your business. So if you create one folder, this is the one that it needs to be. In addition to setting up that brand kit, I highly, highly recommend that you create yourself a brand folder.\
\
[00:11:35.830] - Kristin Rappaport\
And inside this folder, you create subfolders for your most used design elements, stock photos, brand selfies, mockups of your digital products or your freebies, and anything else that you want to be able to quickly access. So let me go over into my brand folder. So here's my Kristin Rapp brand folder. I have got templates, I have got design elements. These are things like little stars and any fun graphics that you want to add to your design, so jazz them up a bit. Stock images. These are images that I have purchased, and I have them all in one very easy to access folder. I have brand photos of myself, and I have vanities and mockups. So Those are mockups of my membership and lead magnets and all kinds of things like that. I highly recommend that you create that brand folder. And as I mentioned earlier, in that brand kit where I showed you that I did not have photos and elements and icons uploaded into that section in the brand kit, it's because I have them in their own folder. That makes finding all of your branding elements really quick and easy to access. And a hot tip for you guys, once you have your folder system all set up, I want you to stay away from this home screen.\
\
[00:12:46.960] - Kristin Rappaport\
Let me know in the chat if you open Canva and you're like, Holy cow, there's so much stuff here. I'm looking for this one thing, I can't find it. This is basically all of your designs that you have ever created. My tip for you is to pop hop right into the Projects tab. This way you can get right to your folder, find your design that you need to work on, and get to designing. When you have your account organized, you can, Oh, I need to work on something for the brand bash. I can go into this folder and I've got all of my brand bash materials here in this brand bash folder. So it makes things very, very easy to access. And then you can stop feeling insanely overwhelmed when you open up Canva, you get to that home screen, and everything is everywhere. Now I want to talk about this magical left panel. Not only is a left panel, basically like your command center for design, but it houses just about everything you need. Text, you can access the element library, photos, images, videos, and anything that you've put into a folder that That projects button right here, you need to make that your best friend because that is where you can access anything and everything in your account.\
\

And it functions amazingly when you have everything organized into folders. From the left panel, you can also quickly access that brand kit to grab fonts, apply the styles to templates, your brand voice, anything you've uploaded into your photos, graphics or icons. And you can access the Images, elements, designs or parts of a design that you've put into a folder in just a few clicks. And to me, this is really how you can streamline your design work. Let's create a quick graphic using my personal brand folder. So I'm going to into projects, and I'm going to go find Kristin Rapp brand. Most designs are jump started with a stock photo. I'm just going to go into all of my stock photos. I have tons and tons to choose from here. I'm just going to pick one to add to this background. I'm going to add a rectangle. Just click R on your keyboard to add a rectangle to a brand color and drop the transparency just a little bit. Now I'm like, okay, I have definitely got some headlines that I have designed in the past from. I don't want to start from scratch because I want to make sure that everything is staying consistent and looks like their little buddies seen on different platforms.\
\
[00:15:08.650] - Kristin Rappaport\
I'm going to go into my Templates and let's go find my Pinterest pin. Here's my pin template file. I'm going to click into that. As you can see, these are all of the pages in that other design file for my Pinterest pin template. I can click any image on here, and what it's going to do is it's going to add everything that was on that design file into this file. We're going to copy the text and we're going to paste that onto this document. Why recreate stuff when you've already done the work? In my opinion, it's like, if you design something once, let's get the most bang for our buck here. Now I've got this headline on my image here. When you do this, it's pretty common that you are probably going to have to resize some things to make them fit into your new layout. But the important thing is that you've got the same headline style or text style or or whatever it is that you're accessing from another design. You can stay really, really consistent all while saving yourself time. Why? Recreate when you've already done the work once. Then let's say maybe I'm creating a blog post graphic and I want to show off this free lead magnet that I've already designed.\
\
[00:16:16.390] - Kristin Rappaport\
I've already done mockups for the thing. I'm going to go into vanities and mockups, and then I'm going to go into this, what I call a mockup build file. In this document, I've created a handful of really nice mockups mockups that I could potentially add to any graphic. I'm going to go with this, Color Palette Starter Kit. I'm going to copy everything. Sometimes, Canva will automatically replace your current page that you're working on with whatever you're trying to add to it. I always just add a new page, and that way I know it's not going to delete my work. Now I've got this mockup on here. What can I add to jazz this up a little bit? I'm going to look for some design elements that maybe I've put into my design element folder. Let's pop into here and let's maybe do some of little stars over here, put them down here in the corner, and then maybe I want to add a little blobby thing here to ground this design. As you guys can see, anything that you put in a folder is very easy to access. Press right from the left panel, and you can reuse and repurpose within just a few clicks.\
\
[00:17:22.190] - Kristin Rappaport\
You can do this with headlines, you can do this with mockup files, you can do this with elements. As long as it's in a folder and you know where it is, you can quickly click and add to designs to make designing so fast and so much less painful. Let's jump into some designer-level techniques that anyone can do, even if you're not a graphic designer. I want to show you guys a simple background technique that I use quite often. I have created a folder, and these are the things that I'm going to be using to show you these techniques. In this folder, I've got images, I've got some designs I can access, and some JPEGs of some lead magnet. Let's quickly add a background. When you're working with a background, you really want to make sure that your text is readable on top of the background. So by dropping the transparency, and this is such an easy technique, but it produces great results just about every time. Drop that transparency down by clicking into that checkered box, and then you've got that slider there to drop the transparency a little bit. And now I want to add some text to this.\
\
[00:18:24.820] - Kristin Rappaport\
We're going to go with this dark text. Dark text on a lighter background is going to work very well You really want your text to be readable. Now I've got a really simple background, and you could add more things to this if you wanted to, but I love the look of that fated photo background. Likewise, you can also do this with a darker background. Let's grab that photo again. I'm going to click R to add a rectangle. This can be any one of your brand colors. Usually a darker color is going to work quite well for this technique. I'm just going to grab my darker brand color here. We're going to drop the transparency just a little bit. Now I'm going to go grab my white text. Let's add this to the page. Now we've got this white text right here on the page. One thing that I love to do to really just make your text pop is to add that text effect. It's the lift. I just feel like that little lift really makes your text pop. It's just a really nice, subtle, yet professional-looking design technique. So that's simple background technique. Number two is the photo in the back with a color overlay brand color on top, and white text.\
\
[00:19:32.850] - Kristin Rappaport\
Not only do I love sharing design techniques, I love sharing ways that make designing easier for you. How many times have you guys thought, Oh, my gosh, this is the perfect stock photo. I love this. I need to use this. And then You get it on your background and you're like, Okay, how am I going to work text into this? One thing that I always recommend that when you guys are looking for stock photos, think about how you're going to incorporate your text. Keep that in the back of your mind. Great photo. How am I going to work the text into it? Especially if you're designing a Pinterest pin or a blog post featured image. So I want to show you guys a real quick fix.\
\
[00:20:07.010] - Kristin Rappaport\
There's some empty space over here on the right, but there's clearly not enough space for me to put my text.\
\
[00:20:13.260] - Kristin Rappaport\
Any text that I put on here is probably going to be fighting with the wallet here. So a quick trick is to duplicate your photo, and then all you need to do is flip it. Flip it horizontal. And what I'm going to do is I'm just going to bump this right up to the edge of that graphic. Then we can group these photos together and we can expand the photo to fit the space. All of a sudden, you've got a perfect area to add in your text headline. The next design technique I want to share with you is creating gradient fades. These have a magical way of leveling up any graphic that you are working on. I'm going to pop over to a new design document, and I'm just going to recreate this, and I'm going to show you how to work with these gradient fades. Let me click to my background image, and then I'm going to just click R to add a rectangle. And what I'm looking to do is add a white transition fade here. So I'm going to click into my rectangle. We're going to go into color. This is where you find the gradient.\
\
[00:21:12.980] - Kristin Rappaport\
So you need to click in to add new color. I don't know why this is hidden because it's such a great feature. And then go into gradient. So I'm going to make this white. You can also use this color picker to select any color in your background or your brand color. And then this one I'm also going to make to white, too. But the important thing here and the step that you don't want to miss is drop this slider all the way down to the left. Now I have this really nice gradient that I can manipulate over my image to give myself an area to add some text. It's not fighting with the background. I'm going to just duplicate that, and we're going to flip that around and I'm going to add a pink gradient on the bottom. We're just going to go back into the gradient and I'm going to change that color to this. We'll just grab this pink. Now I have a really nice canvas for adding my text on top of. We want our text to be readable. If it's not readable, people are just not going to read it and they're going to keep scrolling.\
\
[00:22:06.530] - Kristin Rappaport\
We'll add this. We got our nice big, chunky, readable text headline. I always encourage people to add the lovely call to action because if you don't tell your viewers what you want them to do, they probably won't do it. That's just the psychology behind marketing and design. Now I have my call to action down here in the bottom and with this pink gradient and just this really nice background that I have created My text is readable, my call to action, and my mockup stands out, and this just results in a really nice-looking graphic. I want to quickly show you guys how you can remove the photo of a background in just a few clicks. Let's say I have this blog post graphic. I want to add a photo of myself. I happen to have a folder in my brand folder that is all of my brand photos. I'm just going to click to add it. I take my brand photos in my bathroom just because the lighting is really good in there, but nobody wants to see me in the bathroom. Let's quickly remove the background. Right up above, you're going to see background remover.\
\
[00:23:07.570] - Kristin Rappaport\
All you need to do is click that. In just a few seconds, Canva works its magic. You can also click into it and let's say you had some fly away hairs or it maybe cut off your ear, you can erase parts that it didn't remove, and you can also restore parts, like maybe a missing ear or earring. Now I have my cut out of myself, and I'll just flip this to make it fit into this graphic. We'll put this on here, make that fit. Another technique I'll quickly show you, I love the look of this outline effect. If you select your image that's cut out, you can go into Edit, and we're going to go into Shadows, and we can add an outline here. I really like the look of white, but you could do any of your brand colors. This is a really good way to make you pop. Next up is adding some dimension with drop shadow. There's a couple of different ways that you can add dimension to your designs with drop shadows. You can add a drop shadow to text. We're going to select the text, go into effects and lift.\
\
[00:24:05.200] - Kristin Rappaport\
You've got this little slider down here, and I usually bump it up to 100. That really just adds a nice depth and dimension to your text all while making it pop and stand out. Canva's Element Library has tons of different shadows that you can add. I'm just going to type in shadow, and I want to make this phone pop just a little bit. I'm going to go into graphics. I am looking for this rectangle shadow. I'm going to twist We'll make this a little bit smaller so it just fits behind this phone. We're going to send it behind. Now all of a sudden, I've got this lovely dimension, and my phone almost looks like it's floating on the graphics. That is a really fun technique you can do. Another one that I'm using a lot is this shadow right here. I like to put this underneath a button. Just anything that you can do subtly to draw attention to important things in your design, like a button, is going to be amazing. You can also add shadows to an image. Let's say you're creating a quick mockup. You can go into Edit. We're going to go into Shadows.\
\
[00:25:07.180] - Kristin Rappaport\
Then I often just use this glow. You can change the intensity and the blur amount, the size and the color and all of that stuff. We'll just apply that style to that image, too. Now I've got this nice little mockup that's popping off of the background. It's becoming more of a focal point in your design. I also want to encourage you guys to try out some realistic elements. All of these elements I found in the Canva library, and there is no shortage of things that you can find. You can either do flower PNG. So PNG is the transparent background. So that's an option that's going to give you some different... Let me go into photos. Cut You have options of flowers and different things that you could use. And you can also type in whatever it is that you're looking for, go into the filters, and then cutouts only. These are going to show you everything that's a flower that doesn't have a background. And what can you do with these? Joanne and I have working on really jazzing up her graphics with these realistic elements. They're subtle, they just create that level of realness and connect with your audience in different ways, all while jazzing up your graphics and making you look just amazing.\
\
[00:26:14.140] - Kristin Rappaport\
She's got different, like a eucalyptus sleeve. We found ribbons, keys. There is no shortage of realistic elements in the Canva Element Library. Realistic elements are a really easy way to jazz up however you're displaying your digital products or mockups. And even if you want to build out highly detailed mockups of your memberships, your online programs, courses, whatever it is that you are creating, these realistic elements just icing on the cake. I love them, and it's something that I have been using a ton in my graphics. This is not a design technique. This is one of those things that I want to share with you because it definitely makes designing easier, and that is working with individual text boxes. And let me show you quickly what I mean by this. You've got a text box, you type in your text and you're like, Okay, this is boring as all. Heck, what am I going to do with this? How am I going to jazz this up? I'm going to recommend that you guys get into the habit of having your text in different text boxes. This way we can easily rotate things, we can switch out fonts quickly.\
\
[00:27:16.230] - Kristin Rappaport\
We can change the sizing of the fonts without affecting or fiddling around and struggling with the text all in one text boxes. We can change the fonts quickly. Let me go grab one of my other brand fonts. We can make things italic. We can adjust the size separately. And this gives you so much more design freedom. If you are working with text, try doing different text boxes to see what freedom that you have as you design.\
\
[00:27:46.410] - Kristin Rappaport\

**Transcript:**\
[00:00:09.860] - Madison Wetherill, graceandvinestudios.com\
Welcome, everyone. I am so glad that you have decided to join me today for my presentation on branding beyond a logo, the key to creating consistent branding.\
\
[00:00:19.700] - Madison\
So let's get started and imagine that you are planning out your day and you need to go to the store so you get your shopping list all together. And you had to one of your favorite stores, Target. You recognize the red signage. You pull into a parking space and you walk towards the store. Now you expect to walk in and see more of that red signage, an open floor plan and lots of white space. But instead, you walk into this.\
\
[00:00:48.970] - Madison\
What is most likely to happen in this scenario? You're most likely to turn around and walk back to your car confused, maybe a little frustrated that you wasted your time and you're most likely not going to return back to this location.\
\
[00:01:05.380] - Madison\
What happened is that your expectation did not match the reality of your experience. Now, this type of experience is exactly what we want to avoid when we are attracting new people to our blog. And we want to make sure that the way that your audience is perceiving your brand is how they are also experiencing it. And this is why consistent and strategic branding is so important for bloggers. When someone comes across your brand for the first time, it is likely not on your blog at all. It might be on Pinterest or Google or maybe even on social media. Once that person takes action and hops over to your website, we want to make sure that their expectation is matching the reality of what they see on your blog.\
\
[00:01:53.470] - Madison\
So, consistent branding in this way can lead to so many great things for your blog. It can lead to five star reviews or instant feedback when you publish a new blog post, whether that is a DIY project or a travel article or a new recipe, it's going to lead to raving fans who share about your content and help you to grow your audience. It's going to help you to have competent messaging and consistent messaging, which will instantly connect you to your ideal reader. It will also give you the opportunity to create digital products that will resonate with your audience and they will actually sell. And finally, one of the most important things is that it will allow you to have the professional and reputable brand that you are hoping for. And that can lead to so many things, so many bigger opportunities for your blog, things like writing a book, launching a course, being on a TV show. There are so many opportunities that can come, but you have to first make sure that you're putting your best foot forward and you are really presenting your brand in a professional way.\
\
[00:03:02.440] - Madison\
Now, for those of you who I don't know already, my name is Madison Wetherill and I run Grace and Vine Studios. I am a Web designer and branding strategist, and we work with our clients in a couple of different ways, primarily through branding and website design. We also have a signature package called "Designer for a Day", where we hop into your blog and go through that never ending to do list of items that you have and help you fix those things up.\
\
[00:03:28.150] - Madison\
Now, I have been working with clients in this way since twenty fifteen. These are just a few examples of some of my most recent clients. And through working together with my clients, we have been able to do things like increase email subscribers, increase rankings on Google, launch incredibly niched digital products that have made five thousand dollars. But most importantly, and the thing that means the most to me when I'm working with my clients, is that we've been able to build their confidence in their brand messaging to help them connect with their ideal readers and their truest fans.\
\
[00:04:03.640] - Madison\
So, in today's presentation, I'm going to walk you through the foundations of your branding that are going to help you build consistency in your visual branding and in your messaging. As we get started and we're all getting comfortable and getting ready to dive into the topic. I would love for you to just head over to the chat, and just let me know about you and your blog. I would love to know who is tuning in live today.\
\
[00:04:28.720] - Madison\
So, let's talk about the two different sides of branding. Now, on the left, you'll see we have your visual branding. Now, this is what most people consider to be your branding. It is the things like your fonts and colors that fall into the style guide of what you present. It's going to be things like your photography style or the type of images that you use. It's going to be your actual logo design and any type of website design that you have, and then any other graphics that you're putting out there, things like Pinterest graphics, social media graphics, advertisements, all of those types of things are all going to fall under the visual side of your branding.\
\
[00:05:09.310] - Madison\
The other side of your branding that is more often forgotten and not talked and talked about is the strategy side of your branding. So, this is the thing like your nesh, what type of content you create, who your audience is and what they're struggling with, your core brand messaging, how you speak to your audience and then your core values. And these are the things that are going to be your opinions or philosophies on maybe the type of content that you share or just in general.\
\
[00:05:42.130] - Madison\
So, like I said, many people start with the visual side of their branding. First they might create. A logo on Canva, or maybe they ask a friend to do it. Maybe they hire someone really inexpensive on Fiverr. And when you get started with any new business or your blog, there's really a lot of emphasis on making it look good from the start.\
\
[00:06:03.060] - Madison\
Now, I have no issue with great looking branding and branding that puts your best foot forward. But the problem with focusing on the visual side first is that you aren't always clear about what your blog is about, and you're not clear about who you're speaking to through your blog. And it is likely that all of that work, whether it is a lot of work and money or just a little bit of work and money, is going to be quickly outgrown when you start to develop more of this brand identity and strategy for your blog. And then what what always happens is you start to try to reinvent the wheel and find something that might resonate more with you.\
\
[00:06:42.180] - Madison\
And that is what's going to lead in to inconsistency in your visual branding across platforms and in the way that you're presenting yourself. I see this a lot with my clients who come to work with me. They feel like something is off with their branding. Maybe it's not resonating with their audience or they aren't feeling confident about it. And so, they go and try to reinvent their branding through different Pinterest graphics or different social media graphics. And again, that just leads to things looking inconsistent, looking unpolished across all the different channels.\
\
[00:07:14.550] - Madison\
This is what creates that experience that we talked about at the beginning, where your audience might be expecting one thing based on a Pinterest graphic that they're clicking on. And when they get to your blog, they're experiencing something totally different and they're confused and frustrated and maybe they just go right back to Pinterest and never come back. This ultimately is not going to lead to building trust with your readers.\
\
[00:07:42.950] - Madison\
So, if you haven't downloaded the worksheet already, I would definitely encourage you to do that. And if you don't have time to download it right now, just grab a scrap sheet of paper, because we're going to be working through some of these sections together throughout this presentation. And some of these questions, I'm going to have you jot down answers to you may not know right off the top of your head, but I would encourage you to just write something down. Even if it's not the best answer or the right answer, this will get your wheels turning and you can always come back to these sections that you're stuck on later on. But you'll see throughout this presentation, that these different sections do build on each other. So, I would encourage you to just get something down, even if it's not one hundred percent. The final answer that you'll have.\
\
[00:08:25.730] - Madison\
So first, we're going to dive into your niche. Now your niche is going to actually break down into three different levels. And the first level that I want you to write down and maybe even put in the chat is what type of content do you create now? If you envision your niche being sort of like an inverted pyramid at the very top, you have kind of the widest section it's going to catch the most. So, that might be things like you create recipes or DIY projects, parenting tips, home decor, travel, etc. This is really that top level niche that is going to separate you, and it's going to start to put bloggers into different buckets of based on what they're creating.\
\
[00:09:10.280] - Madison\
So, the second level is going to be your special team. So, within the type of content that you just wrote down, what is the specific type that you are sharing? So if you're a food blogger, maybe you're sharing weeknight dinner recipes. If you're a DIY blogger, maybe you are sharing DIY farm house projects, maybe your travel blogger and you are sharing South American travel tips. You can see how we're getting more specific here and you are starting to differentiate yourself from other people within your same niche. So, food bloggers are going to start to get into more specific categories based on the specific type of recipes that they share.\
\
[00:09:51.320] - Madison\
So, this last one is the most important. And I'm going to give you a little bit more time during this section to write down a few more ideas. But this is basically this idea that I share a lot, which is if I lined up three to five people who share the exact same type of content as you do, what would be different about you in your blog? So, if I lined up five plant based food bloggers, where would you be different than the person next to you?\
\
[00:10:20.870] - Madison\
If you are a travel blogger, what makes your travel content unique and special? What experiences have you had that make you a little bit different than someone else? What values or beliefs do you have about your specific type of content? I always give this example of Melissa from Simply West, who I worked with earlier last year on her branding and website design, and she is a dairy free blogger. So, I can imagine that pyramid at the very top.\
\
[00:10:50.570] - Madison\
We would have she's a food blogger. Then the next layer is that she's a dairy free food blogger. The final layer is that one of her philosophies about cooking dairy free, is that she believes recipes should sort of naturally be dairy free and not use products that are like fake cheese or fake products that are imitation. And really she tries to rely on recipes that are just consistently dairy free, and maybe you're taking one ingredient away instead of having to add in additional things.\
\
[00:11:22.070] - Madison\
So, I'm going to give you about a minute to write down anything that's coming to mind right now. I wanted to sit on this question a little bit longer because there's often a few answers. But I want you to really think about those specific things about you, your brand. Maybe in specific ways that you make that content like I shared with the example from Melissa, because I'm going to give you about a minute to do that now. Okay, so now that we have our niche figured out, we're going to dive into the next section, which is your audience.\
\
[00:12:47.250] - Madison\
So, first thing I want to mention here is that most people, when they think about defining their audience, they immediately jump to demographics. Now, demographics are really great for helping you to visualize a specific person. They're really helpful for working with brands who are going to really care about specific demographics. But as we're thinking about our audience, I want you to be a little bit more specific with these ideas. I don't want this to be a fictional made up person or you're just kind of choosing something. I want you to really think about if you know a specific audience member that you've had conversations with, or if you know somebody in your real life who is kind of the perfect person to follow your blog because of something they're struggling with.\
\
[00:13:28.680] - Madison\
What you envision that person as we answer these questions. And when it comes to these questions, if there are things that you're not one hundred percent sure about, I would encourage you again to just write down the best answer or the thing that you think might be the right answer, because you can always touch base with your audience later and find out if these things are true. So, right now, I want you to just really lean into whatever it is that you know about your audience.\
\
[00:13:53.190] - Madison\
So, let's first talk about who are they? Who are these people? And you can talk about things like their demographics. You can talk about their family makeup or their occupation. Maybe you can talk about their past experiences. If they for example, if you're a parenting blogger and you are attracting an audience who maybe has lost a child in the past, maybe that is something that, you know specifically about them. Any type of information that you know about these people, I would encourage you to just write that down so you can start to paint the picture of who it is that's coming to your blog.\
\
[00:14:27.950] - Madison\
The next question is going to be, what is their biggest challenge when it comes to the content that you're creating? So, if you're a food blogger, what is their biggest challenge with making your recipe? And I always like to encourage people to think about what might stop them from doing your project, your recipe, whatever it is, whatever type of content you create, what is in their way of taking action on your blog post in the first place. That is often a challenge that you can address within your messaging or within your blog post content. So, I would think about what their biggest challenges are related to your content or maybe related to the rest of their life that stops them from making your content.\
\
[00:15:13.010] - Madison\
The next question is going to be, how do they spend their time? So what are their typical days, weekends, maybe their entire month? What do these look like for them? Are they spending their time chasing around kids or are they spending it in a corporate office or are they spending it traveling? Really think about what does the reality of their day look like?\
\
[00:15:34.550] - Madison\
The next part of this is what do they wish they had more time for? This is always really telling about who your audience is and what's important to them, because if you can know what they might want to spend more time on, it can help you to understand what type of content you need to create to sort of meet them where they're at. And this is really going to help you understand your audience on an intimate level and a deep level that's going to make it so easy for your content to resonate with them because you get them on a level that's more than just demographics, more than just a fictitious person. But you truly understand and can empathize in a way with the struggles and challenges that they are having.\
\
[00:16:21.920] - Madison\
Our next topic is going to be your brand messaging, so this is starting to put all of those pieces together. Now, if you're not familiar with what brand messaging is, it is basically the language that you use regularly to communicate with your audience. It can also be the tone of voice or even specific vocabulary that you use. And it really becomes your brand's personality and the heart behind your blog. So, we're going to actually develop a couple of these brand messaging points in the next slide.\
\
[00:16:52.090] - Madison\
So, I want you to think back to all the pieces that we've talked about so far and what you think about your nesh, your audience, and now we're going to put it into really easy phrases for you to remember. Now, some of these are going to be things that you actually share with your audience. Maybe it's a way that you weave in this messaging within your blog post or on social media or your email marketing as well. And some of these, are just going to be for you to keep in mind as you go and plan out your content and produce it, so that you can remember sort of what the foundation is for your brand and who you're trying to help.\
\
[00:17:26.680] - Madison\
First, is your specific type of content are blank. So your recipes are easy, your recipes are gluten free, your travel tips are for the adventurer. You can start to see how this is really going to shape what type of content you share and kind of incorporates a little bit of the why behind it as well.\
\
[00:17:48.400] - Madison\
Next is going to be your expertise. So, why are you the person to share this content? What knowledge, expertise or experience have you had to help shape your content?\
\
[00:18:01.960] - Madison\
Next, what is unique about your content? So, your recipes are unique because they use they do not use specialty ingredients. Your travel tips are unique because they focus on South America. Next, your readers struggle to blank. Again, we talked about this a little bit on- the audience slide. But what are your readers struggling to do? Are they struggling to make time for something? Are they struggling to take action on something?\
\
[00:18:31.940] - Madison\
And then finally, your readers would like to blink. This can be the time element that we talked about. So, your readers would like to spend more time taking care of themselves. Your readers would like to spend more time baking. Your readers would like to make more time for adventure. So, now we've really talked about the strategy side of your branding, we've started to lay the foundation of kind of what the visuals are going to be built upon. And so now we can start thinking about the visual side of your branding.\
\
[00:19:07.700] - Madison\
So, the first thing that we're going to talk about is brand consistency. So, I gave a couple of examples of when things start to get a little bit off track with your branding. So, typically, this is something doesn't fit or doesn't feel right about your branding. And so you go off course and try to create something new. So, the very first thing you need to do in order to check, to see if your brand is consistent across all platforms is that you first have to review what you have.\
\
[00:19:35.480] - Madison\
So, this can be as simple as taking some screenshots and putting them in a folder on your computer. If you are more tangible and you want to print these out and sort of make a board, that is a great way to do this to. You could also just open all of these things up on your computer and look at them. But you want to look at things like your logo, your website design, any Pinterest graphics that you have, your photography style and really any other graphics that you're creating, maybe just open up your Canva account and look through things. Your freebees might be a good one or even your email marketing campaign template. So, you want to kind of look at what all of these pieces look like together.\
\
[00:20:13.760] - Madison\
Then, you're going to start to evaluate. So, you want to first think about everything we've laid as the foundation, as a strategy for your brand. And you want to start to think about does your current branding work for your audience, your niche and your messaging? Does it feel in line? And this is really when you have to even if you are not a designer, you can still look at something and know whether it feels off.\
\
[00:20:39.170] - Madison\
Maybe you can explain what feels off about it yet, but you can look at a couple of pieces of your branding and then think about your audience member and think about would this resonate with my audience? Would this person be attracted to this Pinterest design? And you can start to just figure out whether these things are starting to build a great puzzle that works. Or if you're starting to see that there's some fragments in place.\
\
[00:21:04.310] - Madison\
Then you can look at the branding and see if it's visually consistent. So, are you using the same colors, the same fonts? Are you using the same overall style, like a minimalist style? Or maybe it's bright and bold and you want to just think about are these things lining up.\
\
[00:21:22.100] - Madison\
Next, you're going to document. So, I'm going to talk about this a little bit on the next slide. But this is when you really start to create a visual representation of what your branding is. Maybe when you look at everything that you have so far, you realize that your Pinterest graphics are a little bit off. So, you're going to rework those once you have this branding document in place.\
\
[00:21:42.650] - Madison\
And then last once you have evaluated everything, you've maybe redone a couple of things about your branding and you've documented it into a brand board, which, again, we'll talk about in a second. Then you can start to create templates for consistency. So, I love using Canva for this. I create all of my client graphics for them in Canva so that they can use them in the future. And this is a great way to have consistency within your templates because it's right there and built in for you.\
\
[00:22:13.040] - Madison\
So, when I talked about documenting your branding, here's an example of what I mean. This is that client I mentioned Melissa from Simply Whisked. And you can see on the left, this is her inspiration board, which we start with at the very beginning of the project. This is a great way to visually see what your brand feels like.\
\
[00:22:33.140] - Madison\
You can see that her brand is light and airy and has some subtle colors. And then what you're going to do after that, is then you can work on your logo design. So, if you are DIY in your branding right now, I have some tips for that on the next slide. But it's important to just keep it simple at the beginning. So, you have your logo design and then finally on the right. This is a brand board. So, this is a great way to maintain consistency throughout all of your different graphics. By being able to refer back to this, you can see all of your colors and the elements that you're using. And then finally, your typography, so that you can keep consistent branding and visual identity throughout all of the different pieces.\
\
[00:23:23.770] - Madison\
So, again, when you're talking about DIY, your branding, whether that's because you're not ready to work with a brand designer or you don't want to, for whatever reason, my best tips for DIY your branding is, again, to keep it simple. So, this means you want to use one or two fonts. And I typically recommend, if you're doing a logo and you're DIY it, just do one font. It's it's often hard for people who are not designers to be able to pair up fonts together. And that's not something that is a natural strength of yours generally. I would say, keeping it to one font is going to help with consistency. If you're thinking about your website design, you can pick one font for your body font and one font for your headings, and then maybe try to incorporate those fonts into your logo design.\
\
[00:24:10.370] - Madison\
When it comes to colors, you want to choose two to three colors at most. I typically recommend to do one primary color and one secondary color. And those are going to be the two colors that you're going to use the most in your graphics and your branding. It's also usually helpful to have some sort of gray color, to be an accent color without really having something that is competing against your other colors.\
\
[00:24:34.060] - Madison\
So, then again, you're going to create a brand board once you have all of these things decided. And that is going to help you be consistent across your platforms. And whatever you want to create something new, you'll be able to refer back to that brand board.\
\
[00:24:47.650] - Madison\
Now, I already mentioned the visual inspiration board. This is really my favorite way to have people really start to see the connection between their strategy that they developed and the visual side of things. And so, I actually put together a free training and inspiration board template for you. So, this is going to be a Canva template that you can download and then a video training that's going to walk you through how I teach my clients to create these inspiration boards. So, essentially teaching you how to go through Pinterest and find the right images that are going to invoke the emotion that you want to have your blog sharing.\
\
[00:25:25.330] - Madison\
And so it's going to walk you through how to create that, how to parent down to just nine images and create an inspiration board that will help you to be building that brand consistency going forward. So I would definitely encourage you to download that. You can go to GraceandVineStudios.Com/inspiration to download that file and that free training.\
\
[00:25:47.410] - Madison\
Now, I would love to stay connected with you after this presentation. I am most active over on Instagram so you can find me over there at Grace and Vine. You can head over to my website at Graceandvinestudios.com to find out how I work with clients. Again, my most common offers that we do with my clients are branding, custom website design for bloggers and our designer for a day package where we go in and fix up your website for you.\
\
[00:26:13.300] - Madison\
And then finally, if you are a Podcast junkie like I am, I would love for you to check out my podcast. It's called The Vine Podcast, and we specifically talk about strategy and design. And the audience in mind is food bloggers. And that is mostly because that is mostly who I work with. And the examples that I give are going to be food examples. But I have heard from a lot of people who have listen to the podcast who get a lot out of it, even if they are not a food blogger. So, if you are a blogger in general, we talk about things like content planning and all kinds of things that will be applicable to you as well.\
\
[00:26:44.710] - Madison\
Thank you so much for spending your time with me today. And I will definitely be hanging out in the chat to answer any questions that you guys might have. And be over in the Facebook group to connect with you there as well.\

**Transcript:**\
[00:00:11.690] - Madison\
Hey, friends, and welcome to today's presentation all about how to discover and share your brand voice through your blog. I am super excited to jump into today's topic. It's some of my favorite things to talk about when it comes to branding and your brand voice, and specifically how you can share that with your audience, so that you can make deeper connections. Before we dive into the actual body of this presentation, I would love to meet you in the chat. So, as we get started, if you would introduce yourself, tell me your favorite food and the name of your blog in the chat as we kind of dive in.\
\
[00:00:46.800] - Madison\
So, as a quick introduction to who I am and kind of why I have this passion for knowing your brand voice. My name is Madison Weatherill. I am the CEO and founder of Grace and Vine Studios. And over there, we specialize in building custom brands and websites for bloggers who are looking to take their business to the next level and who are looking to increase their impact through their blogging experience and through the connections that they make with their audience. I am also a food blogger.\
\
[00:01:13.900] - Madison\
I have been doing both web design and food blogging for the last seven years or so. And I'm also a home school mama to a thre. I have three boys, seven four and a half, and a three month old baby. And then I live in Arizona where I cannot get enough sunshine and outdoor time. So that's just a little bit about me, so that you kind of know who I am and why this is an important topic to me.\
\
[00:01:36.370] - Madison\
This is something that I work with my clients constantly, or work with my clients on this constantly. And since 2015, when I kind of took this business as my full-time career, I've worked with hundreds of bloggers and been able to really help them to define their brand and define their brand voice. So, defining your brand can help you to do quite a few things and it's a really important foundational piece to your blogging experience and specifically to your blogging success. So, one of the things that defining your brand can do is it can help you to plan your content easier because you are not just trying to figure out what to post, you know, in terms, like there's thousands of things that you could talk about and could write articles on or write blog posts on. And so, when you know your brand, you know your brand voice and you know specifically who you're speaking to, it really helps to narrow down that focus and helps you to more easily plan your content.\
\
[00:02:32.060] - Madison\
It also helps you to rank more consistently on Google when Google understands what your blog is all about, and it's not just a hodgepodge of all kinds of different topics. It helps you to make deeper connections with your audience and to really serve them well. And finally, it helps you to have a clearer direction for the trajectory in general of your blog through strategic goal setting. Those are just a few of the things that having a really defined brand can really help to streamline in terms of, you know, what it will do for you in your blogging. So, in the comments, I would love for you guys to post an emoji.\
\
[00:03:09.730] - Madison\
Whatever your favorite emoji is, if that's something that you feel like you want for your blog, if you would like to have more clear direction, deeper connections with your audience, and of course, ranking higher on Google and seeing more traffic come to your website. I would love to see what emojis you guys are putting in the chat, because I'm sure that we can all agree that's something that we want for our blogging journey. So, when you think about branding, or when anyone thinks about branding, there are really two sides to branding that you have to consider. Now, the visual side of branding is what most people think of when they think of branding, which is things like your fonts, your colors, and even your logo itself. But there's also the other side of branding, which is the strategic side of your brand.\
\
[00:03:54.880] - Madison\
And this is the side that I really love to focus on with my clients and that I love to help other bloggers to figure out. So, the strategic side is the things about your brand, like your niche, your ideal audience, and specifically what their pain points are, and then finally your brand voice. Now, a lot of people try to approach that visual side of their branding first before they consider the strategy side. And often that strategy side comes painstakingly later in their blogging journey as they start to figure things out and kind of learn the hard way. Now, one of the things that makes Grace and Vine Studios unique is our approach to strategy and how we really tackle that first.\
\
[00:04:35.720] - Madison\
So, today, you're going to get a little taste of what that is like to really approach things from a strategic perspective first. And we're going to chat about one of the biggest parts of your branding on that strategy side, which is your brand voice. So, what is brand voice and why does it matter for this journey? Brand voice is really the language that you use regularly to describe your content or describe your blog. It could be the way that you specifically describe food or talk about food if you're a recipe blogger.\
\
[00:05:09.100] - Madison\
It could be the way that you approach a craft or DIY project, or it could be the types of specific travel content that you share. It really doesn't matter what niche you are in, you have a brand voice and it's really important for you to hone in on that, so that your readers can understand what your blog is all about. Now, in our fast-paced world where we are constantly being bombarded with information, we have started to believe that as bloggers and content creators, that our brand voice isn't important and that our readers don't really care about it, but that simply is not true. Our readers are moving at a very fast pace and often they may miss our brand voice if we are not clear and intentional about it and if we don't repeat it often enough.\
\
[00:05:54.240] - Madison\
But our brand voice really does matter and our readers will be interested when they realize that it is something that helps them in the long run. So, really, it comes down to making sure that we're approaching brand voice from the right perspective. When we think about our reader first and how our brand and our blog specifically can guide them through the struggle that they are having, we can tap into the really powerful side of brand voice where it is no longer about you as the content creator, but it's about your readers and how they see themselves in your brand. I'm going to repeat that because it's something that is really important to shift your perspective on when you think about brand voice. When we think about our reader first, we are able to sort of step aside and let the struggle that our reader has be the focus of our content.\
\
[00:06:44.870] - Madison\
That is going to help us to tap into brand voice and help our readers to see themselves in our brand, which is ultimately what's going to make them care about what we are talking about. Even if you are in a super crowded niche like food blogging, there is space for your brand voice. Even if you're monetized with ads, or you're trying to rank higher on Google, or even if you are sort of an anonymous blogger and you don't really have sort of that personal side of your brand, your brand voice is really important. There is a space for all of these tactics for focusing on SEO and monetization and even not being the face and the front and center person in your brand. There's still a place for your brand voice because it helps you to differentiate what is unique about your blog specifically.\
\
[00:07:38.610] - Madison\
So, when it comes to your brand voice, to recap a couple of things, your brand voice distinguishes you from other bloggers who talk about the same type of content, or the other bloggers in your niche. It helps your readers to understand what your blog is about, even if they're moving super fast and they're being bombarded with lots of information, and it helps your biggest fans or even your family to understand what you do and to share about your brand for you. This is really key when we start to create a brand that is recognizable by other people and they can share it for us. Every single blog and every single one of you here, regardless of the size of your blog, can benefit from tapping into your brand voice and sharing it with your readers.\
\
[00:08:22.580] - Madison\
It's not enough for us to just know our brand voice, we also have to get comfortable with sharing it with our readers. And we're going to talk about that here in a few minutes. So, the first part of this process of figuring out what your brand voice is and sharing it is that you have to start by understanding your audience. In the chat, I would love to hear how many of you feel like you know who your audience is. Give me a number between one and four to tell me how much you feel like you know your audience.\
\
[00:08:51.550] - Madison\
One being no clue who your audience is, and four being you feel like you know them, like they're your best friend. So, something to understand about knowing your audience and understanding who they are is that it's not just about knowing demographic information. Demographic information like their gender or their age or their occupation, those things are really helpful for visualizing your audience and having a person in your head as you are writing your content. But when I'm talking about understanding your audience, I am saying that this is something that happens when you really understand them on a deeper level than just gender, and age, and occupation.\
\
[00:09:30.470] - Madison\
You want to understand things like what are their fears? What desires do they have for their life? How do they spend their time? What do they wish they had more time for? These types of facts about your audience are things that tap into the emotional side of their lives and these are the things that are going to help you to make those deeper connections and again, get your audience to care about what you are talking about.\
\
[00:09:56.030] - Madison\
So, how do we find out this information? This seems like a gold mine of information, but how do we know this stuff about our audience? Well, the easiest way to figure this out is to ask them and to talk to them about it. I didn't mention this in my introduction, I forgot to say this, but I have a podcast where I talk about all of these types of strategy, tips and tricks for bloggers, specifically. And the podcast is called The Vine Podcast.\
\
[00:10:23.020] - Madison\
But I have an entire episode about out the tools that you can use to get to know your audience. And I'm going to put the link in the chat for you guys. Just go ahead and open this in a new tab and you can listen to it later if you're interested in getting to know your audience on this deeper level. But just to go over a couple of the tools that are really helpful for unlocking this information. The first is using something like social media and the tools that we already have built into social media.\
\
[00:10:47.150] - Madison\
I'm going to talk about Instagram specifically, but a lot of these could also apply to another platform if your audience is really active on another platform. Instagram stories is a great way for you to be able to make these connections and ask questions to your audience. You can do things but like just sharing behind the scenes, stories or information in your Instagram stories about the specific struggles that you think your audience may have and seeing what type of feedback and engagement you get from that content. You can also use things like Instagram polls, or a questions box to get your readers to engage and to ask them questions. My advice for you on this is don't make this a super open-ended or really deep philosophical type of question unless your audience is really engaged already.\
\
[00:11:35.860] - Madison\
You want to start with small things here, and you may even have to just get your audience to engage with you on social media first before you start digging into their questions more specifically to get to know them. So, maybe you just post some funny polls or some questions about what things are on your dinner menu this week, things that are going to be really easy for them to answer before you get into some of these deeper questions. Another way that you can tap into this information is through your email marketing. Now, whether you have five people on your email list or 5000 people on your email list, this is something that you can utilize. And it's as simple as just putting a question at the bottom of the emails that you're already sending to your email list and just asking them, hey, what are you struggling with with X?\
\
[00:12:20.240] - Madison\
It could be, what are you struggling with with planning your meals for this week? What are you struggling with with eating healthy? What are you struggling with when it comes to creating DIY projects? Whatever it is that is your topic that you focus on, ask them specifically what their struggle is and let them share with you as candidly as they want to. Finally, you can focus on having real life conversations with people.\
\
[00:12:43.890] - Madison\
You can use Instagram or Facebook or email marketing for those conversations, but you can also talk to people in your real life who feel like they fit the mold of your ideal reader. So, if you have a neighbor or a cousin or a friend who you feel like struggles with the same things your audience struggles with, take them out to coffee and ask them a few questions about your content to see how you can better serve people who are like that particular person that you are interviewing. Once you understand what your audience is struggling with, then you can figure out how your brand provides a solution for that struggle. This is not often something that is different from what you're already doing. All you're figuring out is the language around how they describe their struggle and how your brand can provide that solution.\
\
[00:13:30.130] - Madison\
So, it isn't necessarily that you're going to have to do a 180 and pivot your content completely, you might just find new words to describe the struggles that they're having with getting dinner on the table, making DIY projects on a budget, traveling on a budget, whatever it is that your content is. You might just find different language that your readers are already using to describe the things that you're creating for them already.\
\
[00:13:54.570] - Madison\
So, in the chat, I would love to hear some of the struggles that you guys think your audience has and that you help your audience to overcome. This may not be something you know 100% for certain, but this is going to help everybody else start to think about what they might be helping their readers with. And I would love to see the different things that you feel like you're helping your readers struggle with. So, here are some other key parts of your brand voice that you can figure out. And to better help you define this brand voice, I have created a free download to help guide you through this entire process.\
\
[00:14:29.720] - Madison\
So, to really dig into a lot of the things that we're covering at a really high level right now. This free download is going to help you to dig deeper and answer these questions, and you can download it with the button below, or you can go to my website, graceandvinestudios.com/voice, where you can download it there. But some of those other key parts of your brand voice are things like what is your story? Most importantly, why is this struggle that your audience has relevant and important to you? If it's something that your audience struggles with, chances are maybe you've struggled with it in the past too, and you have overcome it.\
\
[00:15:04.040] - Madison\
Or maybe you are just one step further on that journey to overcoming it than your audience is. Whatever it is, there's something about this that is important for your readers and important to you, and you want to make that connection with them on that personal level. What are some ways that you solve problems for your readers? Maybe it is the specific content that you share, maybe it is another resource that you share through your website, or through a podcast, or something like that.\
\
[00:15:30.480] - Madison\
What are the specific ways that you're going to help your readers with this problem? Thinking about what your niche is now, it's really important to go a few layers deep. When it comes to your niche. Your niche is not just travel or food or lifestyle or DIY. I always tell our clients that when you think about your niche, you want to go three layers deep.\
\
[00:15:50.730] - Madison\
So, the ones I just mentioned travel, food, lifestyle, or DIY, that's the top level, what specific type of content within that niche do you share? Do you share a specific type of travel content, a specific type of recipes? That's your second layer. Your third layer is if I were to line up all of your competitors side by side, everybody that's in that sub niche of healthy recipes or travel, you know, budget travel.\
\
[00:16:16.440] - Madison\
If I lined all of you guys up, what would make you different? That is your niche, and that's what you want to focus on figuring out when it comes to your brand voice. And then lastly, kind of touched on this just now, but how does your brand different from others in your niche? Maybe what values do you have that make you different? What other types of content that you share that might be different?\
\
[00:16:37.900] - Madison\
There's something unique about you and your brand and why you are the person to help your reader, and that's what you really need to hone in on when it comes to your brand voice. Now, something to understand about your brand voice is that you have to share it and share it often. The more you share this and the more you talk about the unique parts of your brand, the more your ideal readers are going to connect with you and your brand. I always describe this as, you know, everybody who's coming to your blog. If you have specifically a lot of traffic from Google or even Pinterest, even social media, if you have a lot of people that are coming to your blog, you're going to have a bigger circle of sort of everybody who comes to your blog.\
\
[00:17:17.940] - Madison\
And then within that circle is this smaller, intimate circle of your ideal readers. Those are the people that you are going to help the most through your content, and those are the people that you want to attract to your blog the most. Your brand is not supposed to be for everyone, and it's really hard to come to terms with that. But if you want to truly help your audience in their struggles, you have to be okay with repelling some people from your brand. For example, if you're a DIY blogger who's focused on projects using a cricut machine, you don't need people coming to your site who don't have a cricut machine or who aren't interested in that type of content.\
\
[00:17:54.470] - Madison\
If you are a full sugar, full butter, kind of dessert blogger, you don't want people looking for whole 30 recipes coming to your website. It isn't a match. And so, think about it in that way when you know, you know that specific struggle your audience has, the people who don't have that struggle, or who on the opposite side of the spectrum, you don't need them coming to your blog because you are not the person to help them. There's another blog out there who can help them. So, really quickly, let's talk about five places where you can share this brand voice once you have really unlocked what that brand voice is for your blog, specifically.\
\
[00:18:31.730] - Madison\
I have a lot of podcast episodes that talk about each of these pages and each of these places more specifically. So, again, if you're interested in hearing more about this, I would really encourage you to check out the podcast where I can go a little bit deeper than what we're going to cover today. But the first is your homepage. So, as a blogger, your homepage is a really, really important hub for people who are discovering your brand and who are trying to figure out what your brand is all about. Your home page is often the second place that somebody comes to when they come to your blog.\
\
[00:19:00.370] - Madison\
They're going to start on a blog post specifically, and if they land on your homepage, it's because they are curious. So, your homepage is really like the gold standard of a place for you to utilize that brand voice and connect with your ideal reader. On your home page, you can look for places like your about section where you can really talk about you as the blogger, your reader, and who you can help and really put that into a really nice about section. It's also in the different types of content and categories that you display on your home page that at a glance, someone can start to understand what your blog is all about and also having a really strategic and aligned freebie that is aligned with that brand voice. And that struggle for your audience is going to be a great way to help people understand.\
\
[00:19:46.410] - Madison\
The second place that you can focus on is your about page. Now, this page is often really misunderstood as a spot to kind of put a biography of yourself, but your about page is really a place where your brand voice can shine. This page should be more about your ideal reader and their struggle and how you can help them than it is a biography for you as a blogger. This about page should really help your reader to understand your brand and how they fit into it. Now, in your actual blog post and like the content that you are writing, you have so many opportunities to be able to use this brand voice strategically.\
\
[00:20:24.910] - Madison\
This isn't a place for you to just go on and on about, you know, the history behind the recipe or why your grandmother made it or anything like that, which I know there have been so many different memes about food bloggers talking like that in the past. But this is really a place where you can shine as the expert and shine as somebody who is helping your reader with their struggle. Share helpful tips that really align with that struggle and helping your readers with. A couple of examples of this might be a section of your blog post that talks about how to make this recipe a balanced meal, how to make this project on a budget, or how to save on travel costs. For each of you who is watching this presentation, these sections should look different because your brand is different.\
\
[00:21:08.620] - Madison\
This is not a place where you should just copy and paste a section from another blog because your blog is unique and you have a unique way that you can help your readers in their struggle. Another way that you might incorporate this into your content is by sharing the why behind the project or the recipe or the article. But again, you want to align this with the struggle that your reader has to help them be excited about this content. This isn't supposed to be just a random story that you share. You can also share this type of information on social media. So, regularly relate to your audience and their struggles by showing up on your social media platform of choice and showing behind the scenes or extra tips or real life examples of how your expertise helps you to overcome the same struggles that they are having.\
\
[00:21:58.070] - Madison\
You can also focus on this in your email marketing, which we touched on a little bit earlier. Similarly to the different examples I've already shared, your email marketing is a place where you really can make those connections and share your brand voice. People on your email list are already excited about what you have to offer because they're on your email list and they've already sort of raised their hand that they want to be a part of your brand. So, this is your chance to solidify that messaging and the connection that you have with them.\
\
[00:22:27.310] - Madison\
So, as we wrap up, I want to cover a couple of action steps for you guys as we wrap up. I really want to make sure that you guys download the freebies, so that you can focus on solidifying your brand voice. In this presentation, I really covered why your brand voice is really important in a few of the high level ways that you can start discovering that. But this freebie is really going to go deeper than I can go in this presentation time. So, I really, really want you guys to go, either click the button below this video or go to graceanvinestudios.com/voice, I'll put that in the chat as well to get that freebie.\
\
[00:22:59.990] - Madison\
And then carve out some time in the next couple of days or weeks where you can really focus and dig deep on this information. I would love to answer any questions that you guys have about brand voice or where to use it on your blogs in the chat or in the Facebook group after this presentation. And then finally, if you enjoyed this conversation and you would like to learn more about discovering your brand voice and really stepping up to support your audience and their struggles, then again, I would encourage you to check out my podcast, the vine podcast, wherever you listen to podcasts.\
\
[00:23:31.910] - Madison\
Or you can also go and connect with me over on Instagram at Grace and vine. And then finally, if you are a blogger who is looking to take your blog to the next level in this new year and you would like a strategic partner in figuring that out, I would love to chat with you and see if it would be a good fit to work together on your branding or your website design. You can always go over to our website, graaceandvinestudios.com, to learn more about how we work with bloggers and specifically how we might be able to partner together in the new year.

**Transcript:**\
[00:00:00.000] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
All right, guys. I'm really excited that this session from Mallory of Mallory Herrera Solutions. She is a conversion expert and designing your website to do things you want. So, Mallory, thank you so much.\
\
[00:00:11.390] - Mallory Herrera\
Of course, thanks for having me.\
\
[00:00:13.190] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
Yeah. So do you want to give us just a little highlight into a smidge about your background and then what we're going to cover today.\
\
[00:00:21.260] - Mallory Herrera\
Absolutely. So I got into working in this online space. Probably like most people. I started blog. And even though I had gone to school for IT, and I really knew my way around the tech aspects of computers and the Internet and all of those pieces, I probably made every mistake imaginable that you could make when you start a blog for the first time. My branding was messed up. I didn't know who I was talking to. I didn't have my SEO understood properly. I did not realize how intense that was. So I have become a hardcore course junkie, and I have probably taken every course out there imaginable to make this a successful business, blogging as a successful business. So I love helping other people do that. I love sharing that bit of information because if I struggled with it, I'm in somebody else's too. So I started freelancing as a website designer, helping people, especially bloggers, really showcase their products and their services and their blog post out there and be able to convert more readers into customers, be able to get more people on their email list so that they can ultimately make more money.\
\
[00:01:43.540] - Mallory Herrera\
Because if your blog is not making money, it is a hobby, and it's an expensive one.\
\
[00:01:48.170] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
Yes, especially when you start buying all the courses.\
\
[00:01:51.730] - Mallory Herrera\
Yes, I don't even want to tell you how much money I've.\
\
[00:01:54.680] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
Spent on. Me either. I'm not going to bring that to myself.\
\
[00:01:57.730] - Mallory Herrera\
Okay.\
\
[00:01:58.580] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
So you want to give us the highlights of what we're going to touch on today? I know we'll probably veer into some things, but.\
\
[00:02:04.940] - Mallory Herrera\
Absolutely. So I want to talk about the keys to understanding what makes your website convert well, how to be able to immediately look at your website and go, Oh, this is not going to work, because a lot of people- Like.\
\
[00:02:19.080] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
My website right now, we're going to get to that. Well, then a.\
\
[00:02:21.790] - Mallory Herrera\
Lot of people tend to put blinders on. They're like, Oh, my website is my baby. I have a beautiful baby. No one can tell me that this baby is ugly. You know what?\
\
[00:02:32.160] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
Sometimes it doesn't work. Just because it's pretty in your eyes doesn't mean it's effective.\
\
[00:02:38.690] - Mallory Herrera\
Exactly. So I want to talk about what makes a website high converting. Talk about some of the design things that could be affecting your conversion rates, as well as some performance things that could be getting in the way of that as well.\
\
[00:02:52.000] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
Yes. And let's just go ahead and dive in. We'll be showing example at the end, and I'll explain more about that. I'll explain myself before we dig into that. But okay, so let's go ahead because we say conversion, and that could be so many different things, right? So it is the first step deciding what you want your website to convert.\
\
[00:03:14.160] - Mallory Herrera\
Yes, absolutely. First and foremost, you have to have a plan for your website. A website is not just this thing that you put up and you throw up some blog post and you have all of this information about you and your business and all of these different things and expect it to work. That's not what it's for. That's what Facebook is for. That is not your website. Your website needs to have a very specific purpose. And it's best to keep that purpose either to one to two things max, so that people don't get confused. People are simple creatures. We have to make things extremely simple for them when they land on your website because you have about 10 seconds to grasp their attention and get them to actually do what you want them to do. So making sure that you know what you're wanting out of your website is the first thing. So do you want people to sign up for your email list? Do you want them to read your blog post? Do you want them to join your Facebook group? Do you want them to buy a particular affiliate product? Do you want them to purchase your course?\
\
[00:04:15.720] - Mallory Herrera\
Do you want them to sign up for your services? What do you want them to do? If everybody landed on your site and could do one thing, what is it?\
\
[00:04:24.450] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
So.\
\
[00:04:25.260] - Mallory Herrera\
Understanding that is key. Okay.\
\
[00:04:28.530] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
So then once you know what you want to be accomplishing, which is a big step that does get skipped a lot. Yes, it does. I'm just following the course, and the courses will show you how to do things once you know what you want to do. But how do you determine if it's working or not?\
\
[00:04:44.900] - Mallory Herrera\
I think the biggest thing comes into understanding who your ideal audience is, whether you were looking for a particular type of client or a particular type of reader, whatever happens to be, you need to know who's coming to your website and what they're looking for because no one is coming to your website to read your posts about how much you love to play in the snow. That's not what anybody cares about reading these days. People want to come to your website because you're solving a problem that they have. So you need to fully understand who your reader is and what problems that they have so that you know that you can solve them for them. If you can figure out how to do those things, you'll have more readers coming, more people paying attention to what's going on. That's why it's generally a better idea to have a very focused blog rather than one of the big giant- -lifestyle cover- -lifestyle sites, exactly.\
\
[00:05:42.610] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
But those can be harder to grow because there isn't something specific.\
\
[00:05:46.700] - Mallory Herrera\
Exactly. But if you have a very specific, say you have a parenting blog and it covers just breastfeeding, that's it. I mean, look at the website, Kelly Mom. They have made a significant amount of money off of that website, only talking about breastfeeding. That is it. They have become a massive authority in their niche, and people understand exactly what they're going to get when they go there, and people trust them because of their information, because they are so- Expertise. -consistent. But they know exactly what their audience is looking for. So if you can figure out what your audience is looking for, you will be able to convert more of those audiences because they will be able to build up that trust in your site. If people don't know you and they don't trust you, they are never going to buy from you. Yeah.\
\
[00:06:33.820] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
So one thing I did in the past is I think it's like User Bob, but there's a bunch of ones like it where I'll get random people, they'll record them going to their site. I mean, they know what's being recorded. It's nothing creepy. We're not stealing anyone's information or anything, but it's like, Hey, can you tell us what you think this site is about? And if they're saying something that's totally off base from what you think you're presenting, I think that gives you a good idea if your website's converting or not.\
\
[00:07:02.270] - Mallory Herrera\
Yes, it really does.\
\
[00:07:03.710] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
They may not be the target audience, but if they can't understand what it is, then you've got a bigger problem.\
\
[00:07:10.030] - Mallory Herrera\
Absolutely. I mean, even if you don't want to use one of those systems, it is so easy these days to just go into one of your Facebook groups because I know everybody watching this is probably in at least 30 blogger.\
\
[00:07:21.290] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
Facebook groups. Hopefully they're in the Blogger Breakthrough Summit.\
\
[00:07:23.560] - Mallory Herrera\
Facebook group. Exactly. So go in the group and say, Hey, can somebody take five seconds, look at my... Look at my homepage and tell me what my website is about. And find out from there if it's clear. If it is not clear, you've got some work to do.\
\
[00:07:38.890] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
Exactly. Yeah. No, I think that's a great example. Okay. So I know you said there were certain elements for determining conversion that you want to discuss?\
\
[00:07:48.360] - Mallory Herrera\
Yes. So some things that can really help make sure that you are getting more people on your email list or selling more products, whatever happens to be, like I said, know where your goal is. But limiting the choices, as bad as it sounds, is actually a huge benefit. A lot of bloggers will typically have their entire blog reel on their homepage, and then it's just this decision-overwhelmed. And people who land there for the first time have no idea where to go because there are so many options available. Give them three, maybe six. Here you go. Here are a couple of different blog posts that you can read. Oh, yeah. By the way, here's my freebie to go enjoy my email list, period. It lets them know exactly what you want them to do very, very quickly. I think a lot of times, especially as new online business owners, we like to think that we need to have everything on every single page, but we don't. Less is generally more. So focus on those things.\
\
[00:08:53.420] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
People don't like making decisions. That's like hard work. You're asking them to do work to navigate your site, which is-No.\
\
[00:09:00.470] - Mallory Herrera\
One wants to do work. Yeah, no one wants to do work. No one wants to pay attention to those extra things, and have goals for yourself. If your goal for yourself is to get 50 people on your email list this month, then cool. Make sure that you are promoting it appropriately. It is on all of your pages. Your call to action should be very clear.\
\
[00:09:21.830] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
It will land on the page that you share.\
\
[00:09:24.110] - Mallory Herrera\
Yes, people should know what you expect from them. Make sure that they have a very clear next step, because if they don't, then you're just going to lose them. They might read your blog post, but then they're not going to do anything else because you didn't tell them what to do. You got to make it clear.\
\
[00:09:39.180] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
I like that. Okay, so what was next on your list of things you wanted to chat about? I know I have more on here, but I want you to... I don't want to go out of.\
\
[00:09:50.630] - Mallory Herrera\
Order if it makes me... I want to talk a little bit about some of the design aspects that people tend to overlook. A lot of times when people go through and they create their first site, especially if they've done it by themselves- Or they're like.\
\
[00:10:06.590] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
17th version of their site.\
\
[00:10:08.410] - Mallory Herrera\
Or their 17th version of it. But typically, they're creating a site for themselves rather than keeping their customers and their readers at the forefront of their mind, which is a huge mistake. Every single thing on your website should be about your ideal reader. If it is not, it should be there. That comes down to the fonts and the colors and the graphics and the content. Anything that is on your website needs to be about your reader. You may like bright pink on a black background, but it is ridiculously hard to read, and no one is going to want to stay on your website because of it. Make things easy. Make them easy to follow, easy to find. People need to know where your information is. They need to be able to answer all of the questions that they have about you and what you're offering without having to go hunting for it. So pay attention to some of those things. Look at your brand colors, for one. What impression and feeling do you get just by looking at the colors? Are you calm? Does it make you anxious? Does it make you excited? Is that the message that you're trying to portray in your website?\
\
[00:11:26.670] - Mallory Herrera\
Some people have seen it before where it was a yoga studio. So wanting to promote this calm, relaxed environment, but they were using this big, bright red in some of their branding. And red means stop and don't go any further, in danger. And that is not the impression that you want to give for your website, for your business. So pay attention to what those things are. Really look at that. Colors are not just meant to look pretty. They do have a purpose.\
\
[00:11:57.920] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
And fonts, too. Like, don't do super scripty fonts that you can't read.\
\
[00:12:03.620] - Mallory Herrera\
Exactly. If you can't read it, they're not effective. Just because you know what it's supposed to say does not mean that anybody else coming to your website is going to know what it's.\
\
[00:12:12.230] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
Supposed to say. Actually, one thing that apparently they don't teach cursive in school anymore.\
\
[00:12:16.910] - Mallory Herrera\
No, they don't. Depending on who.\
\
[00:12:19.790] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
Your target audience is, they literally may not be able to read it.\
\
[00:12:23.880] - Mallory Herrera\
Yeah, absolutely. It is getting harder and harder for people to understand script fonts. I feel like there are more and more people who are using them way too often and in too many different platforms. So if you're going to use a script font, make sure it's easy to read, make sure it is very legible, and use it sparingly. Less really is more. But when you're picking fonts for your site, I would keep it at three, maybe four different fonts max.\
\
[00:12:55.860] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
Three is really good.\
\
[00:12:58.190] - Mallory Herrera\
-usually, if you can get it to two, that's perfect. You have one decorative font like your script font type, and then you have a San-Sara font for the rest of your content. It is-Like.\
\
[00:13:09.120] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
The same font, like bolded for headings and like regular.\
\
[00:13:12.670] - Mallory Herrera\
Yes, exactly. Different sizes, different colors for your headings, that's fine. But have the same font throughout because it's easier to read that way. Also, San-Sera fonts are notoriously easier to read on mobile and on web pages than a Sera font is. Don't do comic sans, though. Yeah. Yeah, don't do it. So you want to make it as easy as humanly possible. Make the font size a little bit bigger, too. Some people just have this really small, like.\
\
[00:13:42.320] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
14.1. No, like size 18.\
\
[00:13:44.950] - Mallory Herrera\
I would say at least 18. If you can do 20 without it looking weird, do 20. Make it bigger. People want to be able to read it. Because if they can't read it, they're not sticking around. So pay attention to those things. Pay attention to your calls to action. There should be a call to action on every single page, period. Every single page. You should give someone the opportunity to move to the next step. Whether you were selling your own service or product or you're selling an affiliate product, it is the same component. You have to become a salesman, and you have to be able to put that out there and get people to click your links.\
\
[00:14:22.740] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
And I like the way you say that of giving them the opportunity, because if you have something that's going to help solve their problem and you're not sharing with them, you're a jerk. That mind shift I really learned from Kate Doster, who's also on the summit. But I like that because some people, they feel like, call to action selling, and they are like, I don't want to ask them to do something. It's like, No, if you have something that will help them? And you're not telling them like, That's not cool? That's mean? You're supposed to like your audience. So like you said, give the opportunity for them to move to the next step. I like that.\
\
[00:14:56.440] - Mallory Herrera\
Yeah, absolutely. Think of their way through your website as a journey. They are on a client journey, a buyer's journey, whatever you want to call it. You need to be able to give them opportunities at each step of the journey for each page on your website to be able to make a purchase or join your email list because everybody is going to realize that they want to work with you a little bit differently. Someone may like you immediately from your homepage and immediately sign up for your email list, and somebody else might have to read 10 of your posts and come back a month later and then read 10 more to realize that they really want more content from you. So give them plenty of opportunities along the way so that you are making sure to get as many people as possible doing whatever it is that you're trying to get them to do. So opportunities, lots of opportunities offering the same thing.\
\
[00:15:56.380] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
Yes. And I think... And if I'm skipping something, let me know. I think one of those, in order for them to have that opportunity, your site needs to be performing well, it needs to be working. As I told you before we hit record, I was like, Yeah, I once had found out that for six weeks my blog feed wasn't pulling in the new content, and it was a caching issue. It wasn't hard to fix, but I just was completely unaware. So let's talk performance. Let's talk about making sure our sites are running well.\
\
[00:16:24.220] - Mallory Herrera\
Absolutely. First and foremost, it is going to come down to your host. Your hosting company can make or break your website. Just because it is cheap does not mean that it's worth it. It can sometimes give you a bigger headache in the long run because you decided to cut corners and you go with the free host or you go with the cheaper option now. Sometimes it really is best to invest early on in some of those things because a good quality host will make your site faster. They will give you a free security certificate, which no one is going to trust you if your site is not secure. Yes. They want to see that little lock on the top, the little top.\
\
[00:17:04.730] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
And Google will warn them away from it if you don't have it.\
\
[00:17:07.920] - Mallory Herrera\
Google will. They will send actual people away from your website.\
\
[00:17:11.700] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
You're like, Are you sure you want to go forward? Because it's not secure.\
\
[00:17:16.250] - Mallory Herrera\
Exactly. So if you don't want to be losing people for silly stuff like that, go with a good host. A good host is going to make your site faster as well, because it's going to be able to supply more bandwidth, more service base, all of those kinds of techy things.\
\
[00:17:30.180] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
We'll be talking techy things with Grayson Bell, and he'll expand on hosting, I'm sure.\
\
[00:17:36.980] - Mallory Herrera\
Perfect. Yes, he will. He'll be able to explain all of that. But, I mean, Google did a study a while back, and they found that if your site takes longer than two seconds to load, you've lost 10 % of your visitors at two seconds.\
\
[00:17:51.480] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
Yeah. People are so impatient. When I was a kid, you hit a website, you went and did something while you wait to load, you came back, it was halfway there, you did something else. This is dial-up, right? But anyway, and if you're wondering how fast or slow your site is, there's Google page insights, I think, and it's free, you put in the URL. And I would test a couple of different URLs, not just your homepage, but a blog post page, a landing page, and see how fast it's loading on desktop, because I think the two seconds is desktop, but mobile people tend to have a little more patience because of signal and whatnot.\
\
[00:18:21.200] - Mallory Herrera\
Yeah, so mobile you might be able to get by with three seconds, but if it's taking you longer than three to five seconds, you are losing people. Because if I'm in the middle of the store and I'm trying to find a recipe and I can't find that one recipe I was looking for to get my ingredients, I'm going to find a different one. So you don't want to lose people for silly things like that. So pay attention to your site speed. It can come down to making sure that your images are properly compressed. There are tons of caching plugins for images. I personally really like short pixel version that works really well, so they compress images well. Also making sure that you just compress them before you upload them to your site. Tinyjpg.Com is an awesome site that you can just drop your pictures in. It'll give you a compressed version of it. It's awesome. You can do JPEG files or PNG files. It's perfect.\
\
[00:19:16.970] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
Yeah, image compression. That's definitely one of the things I didn't know when I started.\
\
[00:19:21.810] - Mallory Herrera\
Yeah, that seems to be the worst for everybody. The image compressions or they'll have too many plugins on their websites. A lot of people, especially these days, all have jet pack installed because it.\
\
[00:19:33.490] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
Does-it's almost the same. I feel like it was almost like an automatic install when I started initially, and then I learned that it really can slow down your sight, and so I took it off. But you really, and this can be crazy because I know at a time I had double this. Ideally, you don't want more than 20.\
\
[00:19:49.240] - Mallory Herrera\
Yeah, absolutely. I try to keep the plugin less than 20. I think I actually have one of my blog sites that's running with 11. So you want to be strategic about your plugins just because it says it offers something cool does not mean that you necessarily have to have it. Sometimes you can find plugins that'll do that same task as well as something else, and get rid of some extras, but it might take some playing around. But make sure that all your plugins and your theme and all of that stays updated. Make sure that you're doing backups of your website because the last thing you want to do is have an update roll through, and then you get that white screen where everything just dies and you can't access anything. So keep back up to your site. Make sure everything is updated. Pay attention to your site speed, and just be smart about it. Be smart about your plugin installs. Be smart about your images. If you want to add a video to your website, don't try to upload the entire video.\
\
[00:20:49.540] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
It's going to cost you more money to do it that way.\
\
[00:20:53.220] - Mallory Herrera\
Absolutely. But you can get this tiny little piece of code, this in-deg code, and just add it to your blog post or your page or whatever happens to be. Yeah. So it's hosted.\
\
[00:21:02.800] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
Somewhere else. If you have YouTube, unlisted, whatever, or YouTube, if you have a YouTube channel, it's just fine.\
\
[00:21:07.850] - Mallory Herrera\
Exactly. Yeah. So just be smart about some of those things to try to make sure that it's really working for you. And if it's not, don't be afraid to invest in someone that can help you. Yeah, Grayson Bell is awesome for a lot of the techy stuff.\
\
[00:21:26.540] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
I'm one of his monthly clients too, or I'm just like, Hey, what's going on here? Why can't I do this? Or what? I was like, Hey, for some reason, my sight's down. Can you guys fix that for me? It's amazing to get to be able to see. But he's just super helpful in general. I asked him questions for years before I was like, I can afford for both sites having.\
\
[00:21:46.850] - Mallory Herrera\
That.\
\
[00:21:48.320] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
Support. But he's so generous with the time and questions, and he's in, I feel like, all the blogging Facebook groups. So if you just.\
\
[00:21:55.020] - Mallory Herrera\
Ask a question. Yeah, Facebook can also be an amazing resource. There's a lot of people in some of those groups that have been around for decades working on a lot of this stuff, and they are more than willing to help you out if you catch yourself in a bind with a very particular problem. Also, Google is awesome. I Google stuff all the time. I have a client's website that went wonky one day when I was trying to add in her Instagram feed. I don't know. It was weird. I hadn't had that experience before, and I Googled it and found the problem. So you know what? Google is an amazing resource. Don't be afraid to use it.\
\
[00:22:35.050] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
Absolutely. Yeah. You're never going to stop Googling things or asking questions no matter how long you've been at this because technology inevitably changes, which is where we're going to get to with our example and why that is. But yeah. So don't be afraid to ask for help. Don't feel silly or if you're asking for help, then you're taking action and you should be proud of that.\
\
[00:23:00.780] - Mallory Herrera\
Exactly. And a lot of people shy away from hiring anyone for their business, especially if their business is new. And I am not saying that everybody needs to go out and pay $10,000 to a website designer to put a website together. That is not what I'm saying. I'm saying if you do not understand how to do something that is truly important for your business, like making sure that your website functions appropriately, you may want to look into having someone come in and help you, even if it's just for a few hours, having somebody giving you a walkthrough of how everything works, that can be hugely beneficial. And there is always somebody out there offering those types of services. So feel free to look around, ask in the Facebook groups, reach out to different communities. There are a ton of WordPress communities online that I have found where people are just constantly just asking random questions of different text messages that they have found. So feel free to ask your questions because like you said, you're at least taking action on it rather than just sitting there dealing with it. Don't deal with the problem.\
\
[00:24:10.300] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
I would recommend that if it's something that can be easily googled, google first, because it's a little like, You can take the time to search google. It's one thing if you search google and you're like, Okay, I don't understand the answers. But if it's something really simple, because sometimes I don't do it in Facebook groups. I'm like, You can take the two seconds to google that. You're going to have someone explain that to you. Take time out.\
\
[00:24:35.740] - Mallory Herrera\
Oh, yeah, absolutely.\
\
[00:24:37.500] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
Just be proud you're taking action, but do take a second and see if you can find an understandable answer in Google before you ask other people to take time out of the day. I think that's just considerate.\
\
[00:24:48.260] - Mallory Herrera\
Absolutely. And it's always better to understand at least an idea of how to do the job before you ever try to hire out anybody to come in and do it for you, because then you'll never know if it's being done appropriately if you just hire somebody from the get-go. If you hire somebody to come in and run your Pinterest account and you've never once messed with the platform, you have no idea if it's working. You don't know how all those pieces fit together. You should always at least have an understanding of the problem, of the situation before you try hiring anybody. So yeah, Google is your friend. Use Google and YouTube. Youtube is also another great resource for website issues.\
\
[00:25:29.320] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
Yes. No, I totally agree on that front. Okay, was there anything else you want to touch on before we dive into an example?\
\
[00:25:37.340] - Mallory Herrera\
No, those cover what I needed to-.\
\
[00:25:40.640] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
Let me preface this example. So all my to-do list is getting it. And so by the time this video airs, my homepage will be updated. But it is Hotmess Express right now, partly because I've been changing a lot of backend things. I have been moving away from a certain page builder that I'd been using for a couple of years that I loved, but was slowing down my sight. It was giving me performance issues. And so it's been moving away from that. And so the homepage I built was just done with, like Gutenberg, which I was also just learning. And so thanks to Pete in this summit who did a session on Element or I have a good grasp with that. So I am going to be rebuilding it. There are literally buttons that don't work. So I figured, hey, this is already a terrible site. It could be a great example for Mallory to take a look and give some feedback. But this is not a reflection of me as a blogger as a whole. I feel like I just need to explain that. I was like, There were a lot of things happening that this is terrible right now.\
\
[00:26:45.290] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
But yeah. I do love criticism, so constructive criticism.\
\
[00:26:51.060] - Mallory Herrera\
Absolutely.\
\
[00:26:51.810] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
Let's go ahead and we can talk through it. I know I can point out some things that are bad about it, but you're the expert. So if you want to go ahead and share screen with my homepage, that is horrible, and we will dive into it.\
\
[00:27:06.360] - Mallory Herrera\
All right. You can see it?\
\
[00:27:08.050] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
Yeah, unfortunately.\
\
[00:27:11.110] - Mallory Herrera\
Yes. So this is the homepage. Just from looking at it from the get-go, yes, I can see a few things that I probably would have left out if I was putting the site together. For instance, this cookie bar is bright blue and just a very strong color, especially since your link is red, so it makes it a little harder to read. The header image here, it doesn't make it very clear what you do, which this is the very first thing that someone may see on your website, and it should always be extremely clear and easy to follow. I would also have some call to action in this as well, because not everybody is going to scroll through the entire page. So having that covered there can really help. It's a little bit dark. It's also a little bit dark. Yes, it is. It's a little dark. And the fact that stop-stressing is in this bright red... I apologize. So the fact that this stop-stressing is in this bright red is scaring me a little bit. It does not make me feel less stressed. So I would throw out some of those things. Apart from that, it's...\
\
[00:28:49.400] - Mallory Herrera\
How many different fonts do you have on here? It should.\
\
[00:28:53.750] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
Be two.\
\
[00:28:54.730] - Mallory Herrera\
It could be...\
\
[00:28:57.100] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
Again, I've been cleaning things up.\
\
[00:29:00.990] - Mallory Herrera\
Okay. It looks like two, but there's a lot of different weights to the font, so it can give it that look of big more. Obviously, not just-That's what we're looking at.\
\
[00:29:12.420] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
And you've noticed that. That's pretty good. As seen is cut off. That's awesome.\
\
[00:29:16.000] - Mallory Herrera\
Yeah. So as seen is cut off. So that's stretched a little bit too big, especially since it's not everybody's screen is the same size. So paying attention to some of those things is always good. And other than that, there's not a whole lot of other color in the site.\
\
[00:29:34.800] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
There is actually. Well, there was. I don't know what's going on. Yeah, those are actually color where the black, interesting. Interesting. Good to know. Something's broken on my homepage. Good to know.\
\
[00:29:51.890] - Mallory Herrera\
I was like.\
\
[00:29:52.720] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
Those actually are color, or at least they're images.\
\
[00:29:58.550] - Mallory Herrera\
Oh, yeah, I know. So the images are not working. They may be broken or something. They're not loading. Yeah, that's great. So yeah, that's black, and then it's just white. That's also black. And then all of.\
\
[00:30:12.360] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
Them are black, and then... Yep. Oh, man, it's even worse example than I thought. This is great.\
\
[00:30:17.250] - Mallory Herrera\
So it mostly just gives it this very... I know that that would be not what you were going for, but it seems like a flat and monotone look to it. Nothing jumps out. It doesn't make anything important. It's because it's all the same color scheme.\
\
[00:30:33.260] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
So there's -I'm so excited that this is even worse than I thought, for example. Awesome. Definitely go look at this now that when this video airs. Go look, it'll look so much better. Yeah. Oh, God.\
\
[00:30:51.540] - Mallory Herrera\
I would probably also not keep your resource, I'm assuming these are affiliate links. I would probably not keep the resource affiliate links on your homepage for the sheer fact you wouldn't want people leaving your site that quickly. You want them to stick around and see more of what you offer. I mean, unless for some reason, these convert really well. You're making tons of money from these links being right here. I probably wouldn't put them here, or at least put them at the bottom because I would rather people get to see them on their articles first before they go to the affiliate links. So I would do that. I probably would also make this disclaimer a little bit smaller, and I would put it in this footer bar. I know you mentioned that you were building with Elementor. Elementor has some really great options for creating your own headers and footers. You can make this a smaller text. And what.\
\
[00:31:57.240] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
I used to be using did, and so that did use to be in the footer. Like I said, I was like, Oh, I'm going to just get rid of this old one that's slowing down my sight and also switch to Gutenberg and just have this steep learning curve while I learn all the new things.\
\
[00:32:17.280] - Mallory Herrera\
Yeah. You know I'm not always the best at it.\
\
[00:32:24.850] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
I'm a go-getter.\
\
[00:32:27.390] - Mallory Herrera\
I understand why you did it.\
\
[00:32:29.510] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
I do. Yeah, but I was like, and I know. And the first time I tried to do the turn, I got really frustrated. And then I did the session with Pete. And I was like, Oh, God. Okay. I translated it to the page builder on YouTube. And I'm rocking and rolling a bit. So I still have to google some things. But yeah, so much worse than it was. I love that the images are broken, like yay, great example of what not.\
\
[00:32:57.210] - Mallory Herrera\
To do. I will say one thing that could be working in your favor is that most people are not going to find you from your home page.\
\
[00:33:04.970] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
They're going to the content. They're going, yeah.\
\
[00:33:07.070] - Mallory Herrera\
Exactly. They're going to go to the main content. They're going to jump around that way. That's why internal linking is so important for your blog post because you don't want people just reading one post and then bouncing. You want them to go to multiple pages. How can I.\
\
[00:33:23.740] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
Make a living even though my home page is...\
\
[00:33:27.400] - Mallory Herrera\
I have seen some blogs with jacked up home pages that still make a killing. Yeah.\
\
[00:33:36.920] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
The home page is not... When we're talking about converting a site that converts, we're not just talking about the home page.\
\
[00:33:43.550] - Mallory Herrera\
It's not just the.\
\
[00:33:44.350] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
Home page. On your site, you're talking about lots of opportunities. Like you said, every page has a call.\
\
[00:33:49.850] - Mallory Herrera\
To action. Yes. Every page, every post should have a call to action. It should have an opportunity to get people to do what you want them to do to increase your conversion rates. So it is not just about the home page. But yeah, down here, this is a hot mess.\
\
[00:34:09.160] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
It'll be fixed before the summer.\
\
[00:34:11.710] - Mallory Herrera\
I'm excited to see what you come up with.\
\
[00:34:14.680] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
I'm not going to be like, It's.\
\
[00:34:15.850] - Mallory Herrera\
Still a hot mess.\
\
[00:34:17.130] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
No, I appreciate the tips on it too. It's always good to get someone else's perspective on your site because like you said, it can be hard. You put blinders on like, This is my baby. Obviously, I can see that my is not working. But yeah, so definitely don't be afraid to ask. It could be just a family member. Someone who's going to be honest with you and not sugarcoat it, not pull punches.\
\
[00:34:46.970] - Mallory Herrera\
Yeah, you want somebody who's going to be honest with you. That is where having a business bestie can be really beneficial. Someone that you can bounce ideas off of and just rant to about all the online business stuff, because I can't tell you how many times my husband has given me that eyeroll of, Oh, my God, I don't want to hear about Google anymore. Find somebody that you trust their opinion and their judgment and just ask questions or, like you said, reach out into the Facebook group.\
\
[00:35:19.520] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
Find a bestie in there.\
\
[00:35:21.150] - Mallory Herrera\
Find a bestie in there. Exactly. Because you're all in the same spot at that point. You're all trying to grow your blogs and your businesses. So find somebody that you can work with to help you out and you can do the same for them because having an unbiased opinion is to look at your website can be huge. Yes.\
\
[00:35:43.030] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
Okay. So that any final words before we tell them you've got a great free offer that I probably need. But any final words before we talk about it?\
\
[00:35:52.510] - Mallory Herrera\
No. So if you take anything away from this presentation today is to understand who your audience is, plain and simple. Understand who your audience is and what you want them to do. And if you can figure out those pieces, then everything else will fall into place.\
\
[00:36:08.840] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
Okay. So you want to stop sharing your screen? We don't need to look at this mess anymore. Can we tell them you've got a DIY website audit freebie? Can you tell us about what that is? The link is definitely below. So you need to.\
\
[00:36:23.900] - Mallory Herrera\
Try.\
\
[00:36:24.210] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
To remember a URL, but tell us what it is and what they'll get when they head over to that link.\
\
[00:36:29.320] - Mallory Herrera\
Absolutely. So it goes over a lot of the things that we talked about today with your website. It's meant to give you a little bit of an unbiased look into your website, what is working, what is not working to really help you understand what steps you need to make to make your website better to make your business function more effectively. So it's a DIY website audit. It's just a easy little walkthrough. You can probably get it done in 10 minutes to at least understand what you need to do with your website. The work might take you a little bit longer, but you'll at least come out of it knowing what's next.\
\
[00:37:10.780] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
They don't know which session to watch next in the summit.\
\
[00:37:13.440] - Mallory Herrera\
Exactly. Yeah.\
\
[00:37:17.440] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
Okay. Yeah. So definitely, guys, go grab that. I know she's got something special for people who buy the All Access Pass as well. Do you want to tell us about that?\
\
[00:37:26.030] - Mallory Herrera\
Absolutely. So anybody who purchases the All Access Pass, I am also offering free mini website audits. So basically, you will set up-time to have a call with me, and we will get on the phone, and we will walk through your website. We will talk about what is working, what is not working. We'll talk about performance things that I can see running some of my tools and stuff on your site, as well as look at it from a design perspective. I'll even go as far as to say, You know what? Your button should be here, not there, and move things around this way to really help you better understand what you need out of your website. So if you want to be able to do it yourself, then grab the freebie. But if you want to be able to- A little hand-holding. A little hand-holding? Exactly. Then we can set up one of those calls? Yeah.\
\
[00:38:17.210] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
If you get the all access pass as fast as you get access to that. There's a lot of great things that speakers have... They've blown me away with their generosity. So thank you so much. That's awesome. I probably going to buy and sign up for that too. We really need it. So thank you again. I appreciate it. Just thank you. This is awesome.\
\
[00:38:39.190] - Mallory Herrera\
Of course. Thank you. I appreciate it.\

**Transcript:**\
[00:00:12.490] - Maureen\
Hi, everyone. I'm Maureen from thecreativeimpact.com. And I'm so excited that I have the opportunity to talk with you guys today about how to create a stunning and strategic blog website in days, not months, even if you are not tech savvy, even if you are strapped for time, and even if you are on a budget. In today's workshop, we are going to be covering how you can blog on the most powerful blogging platform without the tech and design headaches associated with it. We're going to be talking about the five things your blogging website must include in order to convert visitors into customers. You're going to learn the big mistakes to avoid, and I'm also going to do a shared screen tutorial showing you how to create a customized strategic website homepage for your blog in ten minutes.\
\
[00:01:07.270] - Maureen\
We have a lot to get to, so let me quickly tell you a little bit more about me and my blogging experience.\
\
[00:01:15.510] - Maureen\
I'm going to get rid of my face here, so it's not so distracting with the slides. So, hi, everyone. Again, I'm Maureen from thecreativeimpact.com, and I'm so grateful for this opportunity to share some of my knowledge with you today and hopefully help you along in your own blogging journey. So, I like to say that my online journey started with a boy, a big challenge, and a blog. So, back in 2014, I left my full-time job to help my then three year old son right here overcome the childhood anxiety disorder, selective mutism that he was recently diagnosed with, while I was also caring for my new little baby here. And I decided to start a personal blog on Blogger. I don't even know if that's still a thing anymore, but I started it to document our family's crazy experience with this often misdiagnosed anxiety disorder.\
\
[00:02:12.160] - Maureen\
And over time, I ended up sharing a few posts and answering questions in the Facebook groups for parents raising kids with anxiety. And my little personal blog, Blogger, began gaining some big momentum and I quickly discovered I was not alone. Parents began reaching out to me daily from all over the world to learn more about parenting children with selective mutism, anxiety and sensory challenges like my son had. So, again, I quickly realized that I had the ability to turn our mess into a message for the world and make a massive impact through my blog. And from that point on, I was hooked.\
\
[00:02:51.110] - Maureen\
By 2016, after a ton of work, my son had overcome selective mutism and I had learned so much, and I wanted to share more of this information with other parents going through similar situations. So, I decided to turn that little blog on Blogger, my personal blog, into a business that educated other parents about raising children with anxiety. And by 2017, I had grown my blog into a business with online courses, digital products, and a bestselling journal on Amazon for kids with anxiety. And over time, exposure from my blog and my website provided me with speaking opportunities, partnerships with expert researchers in the field of selective mutism, television opportunities, and income for my family as well as the opportunity to fulfill one of my lifelong dreams becoming a traditionally published children's book author with a publishing company.\
\
[00:03:46.250] - Maureen\
Now, by the time 2019 rolled around, I had had a lot of success and experience, and people were asking me how I did it. I knew I could help so many other women build profitable online businesses with the blogging knowledge that I had gained, and so the creative impact was born. Now, for years, I was a huge fan of WordPress, and we're talking about Wordpress.org. It's the best for blogging, SEO. I have used it for years. I designed tons of my clients' websites with it, taught hundreds of students how to use it in my courses to build their blogging businesses.\
\
[00:04:19.910] - Maureen\
But even with a ton of guidance and coaching, I was finding that my students had no problem writing blog posts on WordPress. But they were really struggling with the website design aspect of this platform. They were so frustrated with trying to make their blogging website do the things they wanted it to do and look the way they wanted it to look. So, I set out to figure out how to harness the power of blogging a WordPress with a nontechy, non designer way to create a blogging website quickly. And I found the answer in Show It.\
\
[00:04:53.740] - Maureen\
So, if you haven't heard of Show It, you are not alone. It is one of, I think, the best kept secrets in the blogging world. And I'm here to change that because it is amazing and it has broken down the design and tech barrier for so many of my students. You can see just a few testimonials here. It is a game changer for bloggers who are design or tech challenged.\
\
[00:05:16.390] - Maureen\
So, to give you a better idea of what it is, I'm quickly going to share my screen with you and show you before we jump into the five things your blogging website needs to convert visitors into customers. So, here we are inside Show It. And Show It is a drag-and-drop website platform that provides total creative freedom over the layout and design of your website, all without a single line of code, without any row or column restrictions. When you're in Show It, you can start with any template, so you don't have to start from scratch, just like this one I designed.\
\
[00:05:47.990] - Maureen\
And the big appeal Show It is how simple it is designed. You can literally take things and drag them and drop them wherever you want. You can stretch pictures out to go across an entire canvas by just dragging it. You can move blocks and buttons however you want. Text can be moved and changed, sizes, colors, everything is customizable.\
\
[00:06:13.270] - Maureen\
Show It was originally created for photographers, but it has quickly grown in popularity for creative entrepreneurs of all types. For talking bloggers, coaches, small business owners, you can literally drag and drop things exactly where you want them, change colors, sizes, which makes it a lot less restrictive and easier to use for non-techy people, the sky is really the limit. If you are familiar with Canva, it's kind of like the freedom you get with that. And one of the huge things that separates Show It from platforms like Squarespace, Wix, Weebly, et cetera.\
\
[00:06:47.240] - Maureen\
Besides the design freedom, it uses WordPress for the blogging part. So, you write your blog post in WordPress and you get the amazing SEO power of WordPress, but you design your site in a much more user-friendly visual editor. There's no need for any hosting through something like Bluehost or SiteGround. Show It covers all of that for you. And unlike WordPress, they have amazing customer service for any design questions you have.\
\
[00:07:18.460] - Maureen\
So, when you sign up for a Show It subscription with a blog, Show It gives you a WordPress blog sign in like this, and then it takes you to the back end. So, if you already blog on WordPress, your blog post will still be available even if you switch to designing on Show It, which is exactly what I did, and the transfer was seamless. So, again, by using Show It, you get that amazing SEO power of WordPress with the creative freedom of a drag-and-drop editor. Now, if you're saying that's great and all, but I'm not a designer. Like, again, you do not have to start from scratch.\
\
[00:07:50.320] - Maureen\
You can start from a template. I understand if you're not a designer, building a website from scratch will be very intimidating, not to mention, really difficult. So, Show It allows you to upload a Show It template from a web designer like myself right into your site. So, all you have to do is swap out the stock photos and text for your own. And I'm going to share my screen with you in a little bit to show you how we are going to customize an entire website homepage in ten minutes.\
\
[00:08:16.420] - Maureen\
But first, I want to talk strategy with you. Because no matter how good your design is, you still need to incorporate strategy. And there are five things that your blogging website must have in order to convert visitors into customers. So, if you are building a blogging business, then sales are key. So, you need to make sure that your website is working for you, not against you.\
\
[00:08:39.060] - Maureen\
So, let's get into these five things. All right, so 75% of website users make judgment about a company's credibility based on web design. So, you have less than 8 seconds on any platform to make a first impression. And so, it's very important to let people know immediately that they're in the right place. So, the number one thing that needs to be on your site above the fold, which means before you are scrolling down before anyone needs to scroll is a short, straightforward statement, like a clear statement that communicates exactly who you help and how you help them.\
\
[00:09:19.030] - Maureen\
So that's really important. If you confuse someone, you are going to lose them. So, on this site, I just brought up one here. The statement is the workout your body needs to live the life you want. Very simple, very straightforward.\
\
[00:09:36.470] - Maureen\
When someone lands on the site, if you don't have that statement, like how you can help them, it's very unlikely that they're going to stick around. Now, does anyone have a statement yet for their business? Or if you have you heard of this? If you do, let me know in the chat. If not, what I like to coach my students on is you can start with just something like this.\
\
[00:10:00.060] - Maureen\
Like I help who? Who's your ideal client? Do what? Like what specifically are you helping them with. So that they can, what's the transformation like, what are they getting? So, to give you a few examples with my parenting site, my statement is I help parents of highly sensitive children help their kids thrive in a world that overwhelms them. So, I'm helping who, parents. Do what, help their kids. Do what, thrive in a world that overwhelms them.\
\
[00:10:31.770] - Maureen\
Another one of my clients is helping her statement is helping busy Christian women build a biblical foundation, so they have a guide for their everyday life. Another one of my clients they just helped, we just wrapped up was home organization for busy families. Less mess, more memories.\
\
[00:10:48.510] - Maureen\
And then another one is quick and healthy meal planning for busy families. So, those are just a few different examples of statements. And this might take a little time to work through, but this is something I want you to do as an action step today. If you don't already have a statement, I want you to come up with one that can be at the top of your site. All right?\
\
[00:11:13.830] - Maureen\
And then basically with your statement, I've read a book I don't know if you ever heard of the story, Building Story Brand by Donald Miller, but this book talks about how to really get clear with your audience. And one of the things it says with your website is it should your offer pass the grunt test? Which basically means, could a caveman read it and be like, yes, I get this. Like quick meals, healthy meals, busy families, like just simple broken down that a caveman could understand it. All right.\
\
[00:11:45.250] - Maureen\
The second thing that your website must have to turn visitors into customers is clean design. So, what that means is it encompasses a few things, it's few words. You do not want paragraphs of text on your site. That is huge thing that a lot of beginners do that you don't want. People do not read websites word for word.\
\
[00:12:10.640] - Maureen\
They scan them. Think about how you search a website. Are you reading every single word or are you scanning it? You really want, the fewer words, the bigger impact you'll make. You also want a lot of white space and it doesn't necessarily need to be white, but you can see here, like lots of space, spacing between words.\
\
[00:12:30.500] - Maureen\
So, it just looks very clean. And on your site, you want no more than three to four brand colors. Like we don't want hundreds of colors. And you want to make sure that your fonts are paired well. Just know that a clean design is super important.\
\
[00:12:47.940] - Maureen\
You can see they only have a couple of colors, like this brownish burnt sienna color, this tan color, and this orange color. These are these little hours of things I pointed out. But clean design is really important. And then you can see like I pulled up a pretty extreme example, but you can see how just a site with just tons of text and like this, does this look overwhelming compared to this? Obviously, the answer is yes.\
\
[00:13:14.130] - Maureen\
If you were trying to read this, it would be ridiculous. So, clean design, the third thing that your website needs is clear calls to action. So, when someone lands on your site, they not only need to know if this is the right site for them, but they need to know what steps to take. We can't assume that they know what to do. So, you want to have clear calls to action on your site above the fold, which means before you scroll.\
\
[00:13:41.510] - Maureen\
So, here you can see that they have a call to action up here in the navigation bar and they also have one right here. And both of their calls to action are book your intros. So, you would click on that and that will give them step by step, like what they're supposed to do. Now, for a lot of you starting out, you might not be, like, selling something right away, but some calls to action that are really good when you're first starting out is either book a call if you're a coach. Like book a free 15 minutes consult call or some type of freebie, like a free checklist or a free cheat sheet or something where they give you their email address in exchange for some type of freebie that's going to help them.\
\
[00:14:27.910] - Maureen\
This gets them on your email list and helps you stay in touch with them because a lot of times, I think it's like up to 75% of website visitors will never return to your site once they're there once. So, if you don't capture their email address or something before they leave, then it's going to be impossible to keep in touch with them, probably. Another call to action if you have a shop, could be shop now or get started and lead to your shop. The fourth thing that your website needs to convert visitors into customers is simple navigation. So, a lot of times I see websites that have tons of like options up here or their navigation is hard to find.\
\
[00:15:15.830] - Maureen\
It's not right on the top. It's maybe on the bottom or on the side. You just want to stick to like simple convention. Keep your navigation bar right at the top. Keep it simple, keep it clean. You want people to be able to find stuff easily.\
\
[00:15:30.960] - Maureen\
You don't want them to have to try and search for it. Some of the things you definitely want to avoid is the non conventional location. Don't put it on the side, like I mentioned, definitely don't put the navigation at the bottom of your site. So, they have to scroll through your whole site before they can find what you want or they want. Again, don't put too many options on the navigation bar.\
\
[00:15:51.600] - Maureen\
I think four to five I would recommend at most because you don't want to overwhelm them. And then make sure that your navigation menu is clear, like use things like home, about, blog, contact, work with me, don't use vague things that they might not understand. And lastly, this is a huge one that I see with a lot of newbies is. They don't have a responsive when someone's looking at their site on mobile or a tablet, they can't find a navigation bar like they haven't designed for that. So that's a huge one and that kind of leads into number five.\
\
[00:16:30.510] - Maureen\
One of the biggest mistakes I see most new entrepreneurs making, and I definitely fell into this category when I started out, was that I didn't design my site to be mobile responsive, which means that it may look good on desktop. But when someone's looking at it on a phone or a tablet, it's just a big old mess because it hasn't been designed. Like pictures are overlapping, text is overlapping, and it doesn't look good on a mobile or tablet. And in today's world, where everyone's on their phone and most people are looking at your site on their phone or a mobile device, you need to make sure that your design is mobile responsive.\
\
[00:17:09.990] - Maureen\
And on a lot of platforms, this can be really hard to do. I'm going to show you how I've taken care of this for you, so you don't even have to worry about this, really. I'm going to show you how you can just plug in your stuff super simple and it's already laid out mobile responsive for you, which is huge because most platforms do not allow you to do that. And this is just, I don't know where my other picture went, but this is a very simple example. But with this one, you can see how like everything's off center and it cuts off the text when it's on mobile.\
\
[00:17:45.260] - Maureen\
You need to make sure you're designing for mobile and sometimes it takes a completely different type of design, so keep that in mind when you're building a site. All right, quick recap. The five things your website must include in order to convert visitors into customers is that short, straightforward statement above the fold, a clean design, clear calls to action, simple navigation, and mobile responsive design? All right, so, so far, we have discussed how you can blog in the most powerful blogging platform, which is WordPress, without the tech and design headaches associated with it.\
\
[00:18:18.590] - Maureen\
We introduced Show It. We also discussed the five things your blogging website must include in order to convert visitors into paying customers. We discuss the big mistakes to avoid. And now I want to wrap up our session by sharing my screen with you and showing you how to create a customized strategic website homepage for your blog in ten minutes using Show It.\
\
[00:18:39.160] - Maureen\
So, let me share my screen with you and we'll get started. All right, so here we are inside of Show It, again. And I've uploaded one of my templates. This is my Lilianne template, and right now it's designed for a copywriter. But what we're going to do is we're going to change out our images, the colors, the text, everything, so that it's a new and unique website that looks completely different than this one.\
\
[00:19:01.790] - Maureen\
Now, when you're working, in short, there are three different views you can use. There is the mobile and the desktop view right next to each other. There is just the mobile view only, and then there is the desktop view. I like to work with the mobile and desktop side by side, so I can make sure that changes are being made on both. But for the purposes of this tutorial, I want to show you my full screen.\
\
[00:19:23.560] - Maureen\
So, I'm just going to work with desktop right now. So, for the purposes of this tutorial, I'm going to pretend that I'm a woman named Jane who has a blog and a business about helping make meals fun for kids, so that they learn healthy eating habits. So, we're going to transform this website homepage into one that reflects that business. So, I'm going to set a timer for ten minutes and we're going to get started. So, here we go.\
\
[00:19:45.840] - Maureen\
All right, so first, we're going to start with our navigation bar up here we talked about. You want that at the top and you want only a few venue items up here, so it's a nice clear navigation. First thing we're going to do is we're going to change out our logo. So, I'm going to come over here, swap image, and we're going to upload the files that we want to use. Click upload files.\
\
[00:20:04.520] - Maureen\
Once they've loaded, I can see here that I can pull up my cooking logo there. And here it is. Now we just need to space it out a little bit, so that it fits. You can drag and drop everything in here. Now let's go back to our home page.\
\
[00:20:18.370] - Maureen\
All right, so the next thing we're going to do is come here, this picture, and we're going to swap that out. Assign a good one. I kind of like that one. Take that. Yeah, that looks good.\
\
[00:20:26.150] - Maureen\
And with this, you can keep the picture here. You can drag it over here, move the box and text over to this side. It's all customizable. You can even take a picture like this and just drag the whole thing over to make it wide and then, you know, space it out just a little bit more. And you can move this again where you want it.\
\
[00:20:45.410] - Maureen\
So, again, very customizable, but we're going to keep it simple today. So, we're going to undo everything with this arrow and just go back to what we have. Now from here, we're going to change out our text, we are not a copywriter, making meals fun with kids, so that they learn healthy eating habits.\
\
[00:21:10.810] - Maureen\
Now, that's not all going to fit in here. What we're going to do is we're going to take this text and we're going to highlight it, shrink it down a little bit, space it out. I got to make that like that. We can even drag this down. If we want, we can take this, highlight it, and bold it, so it pops a little bit more.\
\
[00:21:29.390] - Maureen\
Then we talked about having calls to action. So, here we can pretend that maybe she offers a freebie, like a free recipe book with kid-friendly recipes. So, we could put something like, get our top five kid approved recipes below. And we can drag this wherever we want. You can put it on one line if you want.\
\
[00:21:57.320] - Maureen\
You can put it on a couple of lines, so it just spaces out nicely. And then you could put, get access. All right, now if you're looking at this and you're like, okay, this looks good, but I don't really like these colors that came with the template. Everything can be changed. There's something over here called Design Settings where you can change, here's your color palette here.\
\
[00:22:19.070] - Maureen\
You can change all different colors globally by changing them out here. You can also change your fonts within here. There's step-by-step instruction if you ever do upload a template. But you can also change them individually over here. So, for the purposes of this tutorial, I'm just going to change them on the side here.\
\
[00:22:36.850] - Maureen\
But I do highly recommend just changing them globally inside here so, that they're all changed across the board when you start. Okay. So, if I wanted to change this color here, when I click on it over here, you can see here's where the color is. You just click on it and you can either drag and drop it and move the colors around, or you can put in a hex code here. So, I might put in something like, which is a blue and we click, okay.\
\
[00:23:06.090] - Maureen\
And then I could change this one to the yellow. We put in a hex code for yellow, which is, you can put in your brand color. Hex code is right here. Alright, something like that. So, you can already see how this template is transforming, right? All right, moving down.\
\
[00:23:24.950] - Maureen\
Let's change this button to, let's change that to that same yellow color. And we could change our text here to maybe that darker color. There we go. Then we could put in the pain point down here. Struggling to maybe get your kids to eat healthy food.\
\
[00:23:41.430] - Maureen\
Let's make it, your kids to eat. We could stretch that out, so it's on the line. You can center it. So, let's go to size and position. We can center.\
\
[00:23:58.250] - Maureen\
I've got you. And then we could say something like, I don't know, with my help, your kids will be eating healthy foods from the five food groups in two weeks. I don't know, I'm just making this up. But something like that. Okay.\
\
[00:24:22.070] - Maureen\
Then we come down here and there's a little bounty section. A little blur before, when you click on this button, it would actually take you to the bounty page. But we could say something like, hi, I'm Jane. Get rid of this little feather. And say something like, I help families develop healthy eating habits together through cooking together.\
\
[00:24:53.230] - Maureen\
Something like that. Let's change that, habits. And then you can put a little bit more description of yourself here. And then again, you can change the buttons to any colors you want. If we change the text here to that color right there and then swap out the picture.\
\
[00:25:09.400] - Maureen\
It's so simple. Just swap this out. Let's use this one. Yes, that looks awesome. We can again change this background color to that blue.\
\
[00:25:18.710] - Maureen\
And again, you can just put this in the global settings over in design settings. So, you don't have to do this every time. I'm just showing you a different way to do it. Change that to that blue color. Okay.\
\
[00:25:29.530] - Maureen\
And you can see how this is really shaping up to be like a completely different website than the template. Okay, down here, now these are testimonials. They'll say, like you're just starting out. You don't have testimonials yet. You can absolutely hide the stuff.\
\
[00:25:42.670] - Maureen\
If you go over here to the page tab, it breaks down each of these different canvases over here on the side. So, you can see when I click into this one, it takes me to testimonials. You can click on these three dots, and you can just make it check off visible on desktop. And now you can't see it anymore. And if you ever want it back, you just come here and click back, okay?\
\
[00:26:02.080] - Maureen\
But let's say you did have a testimonial. You can add your words here. So, we could say, my kids are eating broccoli now without me having to fry them. And if you wanted, you could add little bit more down here. Or you could just get rid of this all.\
\
[00:26:28.090] - Maureen\
Put this here, and then put the name of the person maybe like right here, and say, Lisa R. And you could just swap out the picture here just like we do everything else. You would upload the picture of the person. Let's see, we could just use this person's face for now. As we go down, how can I best help you?\
\
[00:26:48.840] - Maureen\
Again, this is where you would feature your products or services. Now this background here is a photo. You can swap out the image to anything you want. And then here you could put your different services. So, we could say that for this cooking class, Jane has maybe a kids cooking membership and maybe a, let's see, kids cooking course and family coaching, like that, okay?\
\
[00:27:23.290] - Maureen\
Okay. And if you didn't want one of these, you can simply just delete this one and get rid of this whole thing. And then slide these over, so you can do whatever you want. You're not stuck with exactly what's in the template. All right.\
\
[00:27:36.800] - Maureen\
And then you could put a little bit more description here and these buttons could link to your services. Okay. All right. Then going down, this is where your recent blog post would appear. So, for the purposes of this, we could just swap out these pictures and pretend we have something.\
\
[00:27:51.980] - Maureen\
Like we'll take this one as an image, we'll do this one as an image and let's see if we can grab one more. We'll just take that one as an image. And then you would just put your blog post title, blog post title one, blog post title two, and blog post title three. This is where they would go. Up next is the contact form.\
\
[00:28:15.250] - Maureen\
And let's make that blue. So, we'll go back and do that again. And the cool thing about these templates is that the contact form in my templates are already set up to go to whatever email address that you have on file when you upload the template. So, you just have to customize the colors and everything else is taken care of for you. Let's change the text real quick.\
\
[00:28:40.760] - Maureen\
And last up is our footer. We're going to click edit footer. Let's make our background here, that yellow once more. We'll just switch out a few things here, and then we're going to be all done. Make this square, that blue.\
\
[00:28:58.920] - Maureen\
Let's paste in our text here that we had for our freebie. And we'll switch out our picture.\
\
[00:29:12.970] - Maureen\
We'll change this text to the darker color, and then we'll just change our button to that yellow once more.\
\
[00:29:22.670] - Maureen\
You can add or delete any of these that you want depending on your social media. And then you can click click actions to add the URL right in here, your business name. We would change that to cooking with Kids.\
\
[00:29:40.930] - Maureen\
And then if you have any photo [inaudible 00:29:42], you could add that here. Or you could just delete that section and move these over. All right. I believe that was just about ten minutes and may have gone over just a little bit because I did pause to explain a couple of things here and there, but that is how you customize the template.\
\
[00:29:56.050] - Maureen\
Now let's go and preview it. Okay, so here we go. We got our logo, we got our navigation bar, oh, we got to change this button real quick. Let's do that before we move on. So, let's go back in here, let's hit edit this to say something like free recipes.\
\
[00:30:14.120] - Maureen\
Let's keep it capitalized and we'll shift that over, and let's change the button color. Let's make it that blue. So, we'll do the 08236. Okay, now let's go back and preview. This looks good.\
\
[00:30:37.690] - Maureen\
We got all our colors. We got a call to action. We got our navigation bar looking good. We have our statement here. The pictures look great, lots of white space, not too many words.\
\
[00:30:50.330] - Maureen\
Here's our information about Jane with a picture. We have a section for our testimonials, how they can help. Here's the different things we offer. We have our recent blog post section and then it ends with the contact form and our footer. And that is how you can quickly and easily take a template within Show It and customize it to your brand, your blog, your business.\
\
[00:31:15.680] - Maureen\
We just did the home page in just around ten minutes and that's completely done. And then we only have four more pages to do and each one of them has the template laid out. So, the about page is already laid out here. Again, you just have to change the text and the images. Same thing with the work with me page, the contact page and you even have some other pages like a 404 page that you can customize as well as your legal pages here.\
\
[00:31:41.020] - Maureen\
And don't worry, I'm going a little fast but if you ever do get a template of mine, you do get step by step video instruction for everything. So, you don't have to worry about like, oh, my gosh, I'm not going to remember any of this. I'm just kind of doing a quick tutorial. If you are ready to create your stunning and strategic blogging website but you want to make sure that Show it is the right choice for you before taking action, I completely understand that. It's why I created my freebie below where you get access to my Show It flow chart to help you determine if Show It is the right fit for you and your business.\
\
[00:32:13.160] - Maureen\
You're also going to get my free website checklist to make sure you have included everything for a strategic blogging website. And you can learn more about this by clicking the button right below. So, I hope you guys had some great takeaways today. I know I really enjoyed getting to teach this and I really hope that you'll connect with me for on my site thecreativeimpact.com or on YouTube at The Creative Impact. Have a great rest of your day guys, and hopefully, we'll talk soon.\

**Transcript:**\
[00:00:13.310] - Liz, Host\
Hey, guys, I'm really excited for this next session because I know very little about the topic. Our next speaker is a color psychology invisibility expert who helps entrepreneurs like us who have just so much to do, find clarity in our brand messaging and target our audience with color psychology. So, we can start attracting daily sales to our brand. So, Michelle Lewis is our speaker. Michelle, welcome. And thank you so much for being here.\
\
[00:00:41.000] - Michelle\
Hey, thanks for having me. I think this is going to be really fun.\
\
[00:00:44.220] - Liz, Host\
Yes, yes. So, I think the most pertinent question to start with is, what is color psychology?\
\
[00:00:51.390] - Michelle\
Yeah. So, color psychology is kind of the next step beyond branding. And we're taught branding, which is standing out in your marketplace, you know having that visual, usually your logo, your site, etcetera, to differentiate yourself. But the problem with that is that there's no intention behind the visuals that we choose. So, this is where color psychology. I mean we usually say it's a color, we, like it's our favorite color, but that's usually the end of it. Color psychology bridges the gap where now you're getting more into human behavior and how people respond to different colors.\
\
[00:01:28.610] - Michelle\
So that's what color psychology is. It's how color can subconsciously affect people's decisions, moods, and behaviors. So that makes it a little bit different.\
\
[00:01:39.530] - Liz, Host\
Can you give an example?\
\
[00:01:41.490] - Michelle\
Sure. I can give an example. Like there was a scientist I think, I want to say 1952. He was a Russian scientist. His name was SB Krakhov, and he did an experiment and put red and blue in front of his subjects and tested their physical responses to each color. And red increased the heart rate, dilated the pupils, increased the blood pressure. Blue did the opposite. So, every person has both a physical and a psychological response to color. There was an interesting study that a university did where they actually went into a prison and they painted the admitting cell pink.\
\
[00:02:27.930] - Michelle\
They wanted to see if it had an effect on prisoner's behavior, and it suppressed their emotions to the point where they could not yell and scream and all that and calm them down. And the effects lasted once they went into the prison for up to 30 minutes. So, that's the kind of thing that I'm talking about is how color has a very huge response when it comes to us looking at it, wherever it may be in person or like, we work on screen.\
\
[00:02:53.910] - Liz, Host\
Okay. So, I'm thinking of all the different places of, like, maybe you don't want the Buy button to be red or you know things like that. So that might even be a little different from your brand colors or whatever. What are the ways you see people missing out and using this, I guess, is my next question.\
\
[00:03:19.830] - Michelle\
Absolutely. Especially if you're a blogger, your website is everything. People coming to each blog is everything. And I think we've been taught that the words are the most important thing. And I'm not discounting that. We're all brilliant, and we all blog beautifully. But the visuals are just as if not even more important, because job number one, as the blogger, is to get people to click to your site. Job number two is to get them to stay on your site. And so as we know, people's capability for keeping their attention gets lower and lower every year.\
\
[00:03:54.460] - Michelle\
So, if you're not going to have videos and flashy things going off, what you can do is have a really good plan in place for the visuals on your website, the colors that you're using, that type of branding to get them to keep reading through. You can do little things. Like if your primary color is orange, maybe you have orange banners throughout your site, but you also in every paragraph, the key sentence that you want to have stand out. Maybe you highlight the whole thing. You bold, it you italicize it, and then you make it orange to get it to stand out off the page, those kinds of things.\
\
[00:04:27.530] - Michelle\
And like what you said, the buttons, those are huge, very crucial, making sure that they are set to convert as well. So I noticed a big difference when I started blogging and I started adjusting my branding so that would be really key. It helps so much. And I specifically promote my blog through Pinterest. And so images are huge. Color is huge.\
\
[00:04:50.590] - Liz, Host\
Yeah, our brains just process images and graphics way faster than we do words.\
\
[00:04:57.520] - Michelle\
Right.\
\
[00:04:58.870] - Liz, Host\
So, you don't want to be willingly about whatever graphics or images you're creating on your site. So, what is the mistake people make with color psychology? Are they, like only picking a color because of the psychology behind it or what mistakes are you seeing and how can they rectify that?\
\
[00:05:20.170] - Michelle\
Well, I think the first mistake is not knowing why you've chosen your primary brand color. If you and I were meeting for coffee and I said, why did you choose green? It usually would be. I like the color. I think that it means nature or health, and that's pretty much it. But yet I could say, okay, what's the messaging of your blog and you would be able to rattle it off to me like this. So, we have our overall messaging in place, but we don't have any attention, really, or any clarity on why we choose our colors. But each are equally as important when it comes to messaging.\
\
[00:05:57.010] - Michelle\
So what we want to do is be able to support the message behind our website, behind our business with color. So, I think when you can finally go, okay, ready to dig into the colors and not just choose them based on our needs. But our ideal clients primary emotion of why they're visiting our site, our viewer, or whatever you want to call it our reader. That's when things really start to change. So if you can choose your color based on that perspective, then you're going to have so much more attention when it comes to your branding.\
\
[00:06:27.170] - Michelle\
And the other thing that I've noticed that a lot of bloggers struggle with is that there's no cohesive visual presence. You're not really clear that that is their brand going from their website to their social media to their checkout page, whatever. It's just kind of not giving that much attention. But our job, especially because we know that now to have enough touch points to buy, you're looking at ten to twelve touch points of someone encountering your brand. Well, what if we could speed that up, which I've seen happen over and over again with color.\
\
[00:06:58.470] - Michelle\
So what if someone's going to your social media handle on Instagram. And let's say your primary color is green, and then they're going to your website, which is green, and they're going to your checkout page, which is green. It's going to make that subconscious support so much faster. Yeah.\
\
[00:07:13.100] - Liz, Host\
I think I'm definitely a little guilty of not doing that well enough.\
\
[00:07:17.350] - Michelle\
This is not something that's taught. That's why I'm so passionate about it. Everyone out there says branding doesn't really matter. People buy because of you, not your brand. Or don't worry about branding until you've made your first million. I've heard this all the time, and yet when you look at the stats, 85% of people buy based on visual appearance, it's huge. And that's why the big companies, McDonald's, Facebook, T Mobile, they put so much time and energy into this. Look at any drug commercial that you see on Hulu, you're going to notice one huge color, whether it's green or yellow or purple.\
\
[00:07:51.320] - Michelle\
Like, there's a reason that this is their job to figure this out because I mean in their case, they're manipulating their customer. In our case, we're trying to do it like for the good. But I think it's so important to know this to equip yourself and know that whenever you post on social media, it's going to go that much further because of the colors you've chosen to get people to your site to read your content.\
\
[00:08:12.790] - Liz, Host\
Okay. So, you're trying to pick colors based on where your people are kind of emotionally when they're in touch with your brand. What colors meanwhile? Like how do you go about deciding what's going to be best for you?\
\
[00:08:29.350] - Michelle\
Absolutely. So, this is something called color harmony. And what's really important on your site, and if you want, I have some slides I can pull up if it'd be easier to see a visual, so I can do that. But what's really important is for you to figure out a couple of key questions. So, let me bring those up really quick so that you can see exactly what I'm talking about. I just actually finished building this presentation, so the timing is perfect.\
\
[00:09:00.970] - Liz, Host\
Yeah.\
\
[00:09:01.530] - Michelle\
So, color harmony is specifically what colors go together in appealing way, not just to you but your audience.\
\
[00:09:07.550] - Michelle\
Remember, there's multiple factors to consider when choosing your color. It's not just what you like or what your ideal client likes. It all has to work together. So, if we look at the standard color wheel, I know that pink isn't on here, but pink is not in the standard color wheel. It's actually a color our mind invents when transitioning from purple to red, each color has its own unique meaning. So, these are the key questions to figure out to see which color is going to be best for your brand.\
\
[00:09:36.360] - Michelle\
And that's number one, how does the body interpret that color? Number two, how do audiences interpret the color on screen? Number three, are there any cultural restrictions on the color? And I'll explain that in just a minute. And then is it in harmony with our brand's intention? So, really important here. And like for me, my background is film and television, interior design and natural healing. So, I've studied color in all of its many forms, and I think we not only need to know what happens in the body, we need to know it from a scientific perspective.\
\
[00:10:08.470] - Michelle\
We need to understand how people perceive it on screen. We need to know all of these different things to make an educated choice on color. So, let's talk about red for a second and let's answer these questions when it comes to red, because obviously each one is really in depth. So, I can't go through every color today, but I will break down red. Like we talked about the body interprets the color in terms of raising the heart rate, dilating the pupils, raising the blood pressure. Audiences interpret that color on screen so that's whether they're looking at the computer monitor or TV screen, people feel very intense with red.\
\
[00:10:45.180] - Michelle\
It's called the caffeinated color on screen. So, it brings a lot of, like, speed up feelings, either with an action scene or a passion scene. So, you know that that's what it evokes when people see that color on your site. For the cultural restrictions on the color, it's important to know where most of your audience is tuning in from, and that's so that you can choose the right color. So, for example, as we can see here, if you're wanting it to represent excitement. But most of your audiences in South Africa, that's not going to work because it's the color of mourning.\
\
[00:11:16.810] - Michelle\
So, it's important to know culturally how each culture perceives color. So that based on where your audience is, you can make the right decision. And then is it in harmony with our brand's overall intention? So if your intention is to wake up, excite and take action, then the answer would be yes. So, I want you to look at, these colors, these photos here. You can see red. Notice your physical response. Some people are going to love this. Some people are going to hate it that are watching, and that's totally fine.\
\
[00:11:45.770] - Michelle\
Every one of us has a color bias. But the beautiful thing is, if you're armed to know exactly what it means, you're going to have so much more clarity with your brand, which means your visuals, which means your marketing strategy. And since our goal is to reduce the touch points, one of the best ways we can do that is visually. Does that make sense?\
\
[00:12:07.820] - Liz, Host\
Yeah, yeah I know. It does. I didn't know some of the cultural stuff, so that's always new.\
\
[00:12:14.860] - Michelle\
That's fascinating.\
\
[00:12:15.870] - Liz, Host\
I mean, some of it I did, but yeah, no, it is. It's really interesting. So that is a lot of information for one color. And then you obviously get into different tones and different like, you know depths or whatnot? Because you might not choose red. You might choose dark red. How are you figuring that out? Is there a resource you recommend people look at to try to make sure their colors are aligned?\
\
[00:12:52.210] - Michelle\
Sure. Well, I mean, of course, I'm going to say if you want all this information in one thing, take my color course. But what? I had a big problem with it because I taught this for a while before I separated it out into his own program. And this is the problem I ran into. People would choose the color, but they'd have a really hard time making sure it was the right shade. And if they chose it primarily for their ideal client, after a few months, there would be a disconnect because they didn't feel like they were enough in their brand, if that makes sense.\
\
[00:13:22.710] - Michelle\
So, I went back to the drawing board and tried to figure out, okay, what is the answer to this? And then I stumbled upon tonal color harmony. And I realized that where the ideal client is most likely going to determine the primary brand color, the shade, the tone is really determined by the personality. And so, I tested this with a couple entrepreneur friends of mine that came to me and said, like, okay, my colors are orange and green. I hired a branding designer. It worked really well for a couple of months, but I'm feeling a disconnect and I look at it and go, okay, your current colors are in the summer palette.\
\
[00:14:03.370] - Michelle\
Why don't we move them into the spring or autumn palette? Adjust and see how you feel. And that was it. So, it's really interesting, like, in a way, how much work on the back end it takes to get this locked in. But the beauty is once it's locked in, then it's so easy. And it's something that you're going to stick with for at least a year or two because you've researched it in the right way, if that makes sense.\
\
[00:14:26.570] - Liz, Host\
Okay. So yeah. I think that's an important point is that you can change later on. Say, someone didn't know about color psychology and pick their colors out and everything. What would you suggest they do? You know because I'm sure everything is already set up, and it's rebranding design wise. There's a lot more to it than most people even realize.\
\
[00:14:58.650] - Michelle\
And I hear this a lot. I mean, I've had people that come and they want to learn in the course and they're like, I heard this out. I'm not willing to do this again. So I'm not going to do this. And I said, that's absolutely fine. I'll see you in a couple of months, right? Because usually they keep going, they keep having the same frustration and they come back. So it's important to look at if you're feeling a little stuck. And like, I really don't think that I should be investing this much time.\
\
[00:15:21.180] - Michelle\
I should be working more on acquiring leads or whatever it is, subscribers, look at right now what's working and what's not are you happy with your monthly views? Are you happy with your social media following numbers? Are you happy with the number of subscribers you're getting or has it plateaued or decreased? How are your sales? How are your upsells? Is all of that working? Because if you've put a lot of effort into it, you know that your offers are good, but there's still something that's just not in flow or just feels like it's catching.\
\
[00:15:54.910] - Michelle\
It could be as simple as your branding and your color scheme. So, usually when people analyze that and go, oh, well, yeah. I am noticing this. I am noticing that I'm not getting on camera as much anymore. I am noticing I'm not sending out emails as much anymore. I feel tired in my business. That's usually a huge indicator that it is time for a refresh. And if you put in this work in the back end with the color, the great news is you're not having to touch your website, right?\
\
[00:16:21.730] - Michelle\
Your funnels, your social media graphics, like all of that becomes much easier when you have this in place. Does that help answer that? \
\
[00:16:30.680] - Liz, Host\
Yeah. So, one question I would have is do you ever recommend sort of a B testing different colors if you're just not sure?\
\
[00:16:41.250] - Michelle\
I do recommend going through specific questions, interviewing your ideal clients, making sure that you've really narrowed into what their primary emotional drivers are, and this way that you support them with your offerings, whether it's affiliate or your own products. So, usually if you've done the target market research, then it becomes very clear. You absolutely then can AB test as long as you have a large sample of an audience that has converted or is your ideal client. But nine times out of ten, I found that once you go through those target market research questions, it becomes very very apparent what color is going to be the best driver for you.\
\
[00:17:21.700] - Liz, Host\
Okay. And typically you're going to have more than one color, or at least most people will. How many colors? Yeah. Like you have a main color and accent color. How many colors is too many colors?\
\
[00:17:35.140] - Michelle\
I recommend one primary color, two secondary colors, and then pretty much what the background of your website and your text color is going to be, which is usually a version of white, gray or black.\
\
[00:17:48.150] - Liz, Host\
Okay. And I just want to be a little bit clear when you say primary color, you mean main color. Not necessarily blue, yellow or red.\
\
[00:17:57.210] - Michelle\
Yes.\
\
[00:17:57.570] - Liz, Host\
For anyone that super like knows their color.\
\
[00:17:59.510] - Michelle\
And has been to art school, they might have a little sticking point with that.\
\
[00:18:04.320] - Liz, Host\
Yes. Yes. So, yeah. So, main color into secondary. Okay. And if someone has, like, five colors, yes, we've determined that. How would you suggest they kind of trim it down?\
\
[00:18:20.970] - Michelle\
Well, if you choose from one of the seven primary colors, you have to remember that you are hitting someone physically whenever they see it. So, then if you have two colors, you're hitting someone twice, three, three times, etc. Etc. So, if you have five or six colors, imagine the physical onslaught that you're causing the person. They're going to have a disconnect. They're going to click off your site, they're going to hop off. They're not going to buy as much from what I've seen. So it's really important to narrow it down.\
\
[00:18:50.700] - Michelle\
And I'm not saying you're not going to have variations of your colors on your website, your pages, your social media, but make sure that you have that one primary color and then one to two at the max of your secondaries. That way, you're going to have a lot more balance to your site, and people aren't going to know why. But they're going to be attracted to you. They're going to trust you. And they're going to say, I don't know, I just had this feeling when I came to your site and that's when you know it's working.\
\
[00:19:15.870] - Liz, Host\
Okay. And so, you just need to cut them is the answer, partly. But let's talk a little more about color variations. What do you mean by that? And again, you don't want to have too many variations, but can you speak to that?\
\
[00:19:30.560] - Michelle\
What I mean is when you come to a site, I have a very strong blue. That's my brand color. It's this T shirt. And some people come to my social and they're like, wow, it's so much blue. Like, yeah, but my ideal client eats it up because they're not motivated. So that's where I support them right with the color. But when it comes to a website specifically, it's not necessarily all going to be that strong of your primary color. So, usually what we do is we have a formula to break it down throughout your website.\
\
[00:19:59.720] - Michelle\
Okay. Decrease the saturation by 30% here, 60% here, bring down your contrast, etcetera, so that you can have it a little bit more muted throughout the pages of your site and not have it just be willbam. Does that make sense?\
\
[00:20:14.930] - Liz, Host\
Yes. Yes. Because you don't always want to willbam people?\
\
[00:20:18.080] - Michelle\
Not always my site does. But usually I haven't seen another site that really does as much as mine does. And I'm happy to share my screen and show you two examples if you think that would be helpful.\
\
[00:20:27.460] - Liz, Host\
Yes, please. I love screen share examples.\
\
[00:20:31.110] - Michelle\
Let's look at it. Okay. So, this is my friend Mario Lines. She's a Kajabi template designer. So, she, as you can see, her primary is yellow. Her secondary is a blue, but it's a more muted blue, kind of like in here. But as you can see as you go down, you have variations of yellow. You don't have it all this color, right? You have it desaturated here throughout the page. So, this is in the summer palette that aligns with her personality. Yellow is her primary color because she wants to help her ideal clients feel focused and hopeful for the future.\
\
[00:21:17.130] - Michelle\
So that's why she's chosen those colors. Then you click over to my site and it's like, bam, right. I'm in the winter palette. So, winter palette is burying your face. It's very, as you can see, saturated. It's very thick. And so we wanted it to have much more of a pop on screen. So, these are ideal clients that have used the color method. And here, we have some desaturation, but we also did it in kind of a funky scheme just to give it more of that color pop since that's my primary message.\
\
[00:21:51.110] - Michelle\
But you can see this blue. It's strong, but we adjusted it here, brought it down a little bit, and then you can see secondary is yellow.\
\
[00:22:01.290] - Liz, Host\
Yeah. So, very different blue and yellow sites.\
\
[00:22:04.870] - Michelle\
Yes. Very very different. You'd never think that they were related at all.\
\
[00:22:09.900] - Liz, Host\
And that's the way I'm questioning all my visuals now.\
\
[00:22:13.650] - Michelle\
That's good and bad, right?\
\
[00:22:15.530] - Liz, Host\
Yes.\
\
[00:22:17.550] - Michelle\
So, there's so many things that you can do with the colors on your site. And you know I'm shown brands over and over again that are feeling stuck. And it's usually because of either they have no intention behind their brand color. They don't know what it means. They don't know whether or not it attracts their ideal client or it's just the wrong shades. So, people send their Hex codes to me, and I look through them. And nine times out of ten, they're not in the same tone or color harmony palette.\
\
[00:22:45.660] - Michelle\
It's so frustrating because I'm saying they're going, it's so clear to me, but it's something I've learned over time. But it can be that easy. You were trying to put together Hex codes, and you chose one from winter, one from spring, one from autumn. And then we wonder why people are repelled from our brand, right? It's like, for example, most of us have the background of our web page of our blog, the pure white color, FFFFFF. And we then try to line up our colors to that.\
\
[00:23:14.160] - Michelle\
But if you are in the summer palette, like we saw in Maryland's website, that's not a pure white. That's more of an Ivory white. So that's what we should have as the background to complement our brand colors. This is how like incredible this process is. It's something so simple. You literally just click in your site and adjust the background color, but it can make all the difference for someone that's scrolling through your blog.\
\
[00:23:37.770] - Liz, Host\
Okay. Is there some trick that if you want to look at your Hex codes and be like, are they in the same tone? I just copy the Hex code. I don't actually know what any of the numbers and things mean. I know black and white, and I have the shortcut for my Hex codes set with my keyboard. But is there some Hex code that's just?\
\
[00:24:00.690] - Michelle\
This is kind of a groundbreaking saying that I've kind of put together over the last year. So, what I would recommend hop into the Visible Entrepreneur Facebook group, drop your Hex codes, let me look at them. That would probably be the simplest solution, just that I can give you the best feedback, especially on your primary colors, so you can have a little bit more direction. But you can absolutely research for yourself and maybe go, what are some palettes that I like, look around on Pinterest, see what they are, and just see.\
\
[00:24:30.430] - Michelle\
Like, for example, if all your colors have a yellow undertone, make sure that your white has a yellow undertone. If all of your colors have a blue undertone, make sure that you have more of a blue undertone in your way, it can be that easy as well.\
\
[00:24:43.170] - Liz, Host\
I'm excited to dig into a little bit and see what extent I need to adjust. That because I feel like I definitely do.\
\
[00:24:52.350] - Liz, Host\
Alright.\
\
[00:24:52.870] - Liz, Host\
So, is there any sort of final bit of advice you want to share or that people should know about this? I feel like it's going to require me to Google a lot. Absolutely.\
\
[00:25:04.500] - Michelle\
I would say be sure to find a mentor that knows about this stuff. Otherwise it's going to take you too much time doing the research. It's going to be probably a little bit frustrating. So, find someone that you can study under and then just set aside an hour a week to work on it. This does not have to be all consuming if it brings you joy and excitement, dive into it, because maybe you need a little break from your blog or from your business. But this is all meant to bring you and your customer, your audience more ease.\
\
[00:25:35.760] - Michelle\
So, if that's something that you're looking for, then this might be a good time investment for you. But the great news is you know you're running your blog. You can make an announcement to your email list of this change is coming, get them in on it, get them excited. That's the greatest thing is that you can make this a journey that not only you but your audience craves and gets to see the change.\
\
[00:25:56.310] - Liz, Host\
Yes, yes, and you do, of course, if people just want to have one place to go, pause for a second, and I'll admit this out. So, I'm going to set you up for your call to action for people that use it free. I don't recall. Let me see. Oh, I don't have written down if you were going to contribute to the proposal or not.\
\
[00:26:16.650] - Michelle\
I think I responded and said I was. I can contribute the color kit. Okay.\
\
[00:26:24.330] - Liz, Host\
Color kit would be perfect. So, we'll do your call to action, and then if you get the proposal, you can get.\
\
[00:26:34.330] - Michelle\
Sounds great.\
\
[00:26:34.590] - Liz, Host\
Alright. And I think you have something for those watching. You want to tell us a little bit about it?\
\
[00:26:39.510] - Michelle\
Yes. If you're excited to go more in depth and you want to take a quick quiz to see what your next steps are, you can take the color quiz. We will drop that link below for you, SEO, that you can take that and just get a quick little preview of what maybe your brand should look like.\
\
[00:26:53.350] - Liz, Host\
I'm probably going to have to take that. And then you also have something for our pro pass holders. You want to tell us about that?\
\
[00:27:00.400] - Michelle\
Absolutely. So, you are going to get my color kit. This is the basics of color psychology. I'm going to walk you through the difference between branding and color psychology. I'm going to give you an overview of tonal color harmony, and you're actually going to be able to hop onto Canva with my template and start experimenting with your brand colors. And I will walk you through some other brands and what those combinations look like in the different tone, so you can get some inspiration.\
\
[00:27:26.530] - Liz, Host\
That's fantastic. I'm excited about that. Again, Michelle, thank you so much. I learned a lot. I feel like I have just so much more to learn, and I'm looking forward to so thank you so much.\
\
[00:27:36.720] - Michelle\
Absolutely. Thank you for your time. And I hope that people have gotten a little inspired from this session.\
\
[00:27:41.720] - Liz, Host\
Me too. I'm sure we're going to see a lot of Hex codes coming.\
