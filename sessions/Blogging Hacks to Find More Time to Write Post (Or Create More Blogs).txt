[00:00:09.600] - Elna Cain, twinsmommy.com
Let's learn how to find time and write more blog post, because the more you write, you can make money blogging. All right. So my name is Elna Cain and I blog over at Twinsmommy, the twinsmommy is my third site and my second blog. All right.

[00:00:30.270] - Elna
Now, before this, I started innovative ink for my writing service. That's my first site. And then I started a new blog at elnacain for freelance writers. And then I started Twins Mommy in 2016 as an outlet to blog about working from home with twins.

[00:00:45.810] - Elna
All right. So this quickly grew to using twins mommy as a case study on my digital marketing knowledge and attracted other mom bloggers and twinsmommy formed into helping moms make money blogging.

[00:00:57.660] - Elna
So after twinsmommy, I started several other sites in various niches and I had fun ranking those blogs and growing their traffic.

[00:00:57.660] - Elna
So I thought I can come here and share some of my tricks and tactics for finding that time so that you can write more.

[00:01:13.950] - Elna
Now, these tactics are based on writing and so that you can speed up that process and streamline your process so that you can make more money.

[00:01:22.290] - Elna
All right. So let's get to it now.

[00:01:24.360] - Elna
The first thing that you can do that will immediately free up lots of time is to open up your blog for contributors.

[00:01:31.980] - Elna
Now, what do I mean by that? Well, I have two contributor sites.

[00:01:35.910] - Elna
One of them here is ImperfectlyPerfectMama and I have guest bloggers pitch me that they want to guest blog on this site and they give me the content and I put it on and I publish it. I get a feature image, a stock photo, and I just might gleam over it to add a couple of things. And there you go.

[00:01:58.290] - Elna
So. I decided that when I picked up this site, I didn't have that time to write, dedicate a good six months to writing my own content, so that is why I opened it up to contributors. All right. So like I said, I optimized the post for SEO. And because of that, I was able to grow the traffic to be eligible for Mediavine ads.

[00:02:23.260] - Elna
All right. So this is one of my niche sites that I get traffic to so that I can get monetized through ads. I have no email list associated with this.

[00:02:35.050] - Elna
I no, really, audience is just sort of a blog that they can get via Pinterest is where I market it the most. All right. So if you have an existing site or you're thinking about starting a new site, consider opening up that site for contributors because it is another diversified stream of income.

[00:02:57.870] - Elna
All right, so how do we do this? All right, so like I said, ImperfectlyPerfectlyMama was a new blog picked up and I didn't have the time to write, so I optimized it for SEO is one of the first things that I did with any new content that I had.

[00:03:13.710] - Elna
All right.

[00:03:14.080] - Elna
So, for example, if you type in alternatives to breastfeeding, I'm there in ImperfectlyPerfectMama has a post there and it's from a contributor.

[00:03:22.860] - Elna
So in order to start this process, you do need a couple of things. You need to have author bios at the end of your blog post and you can put them in manually, like the one on my right here. She this person that I guess posted for just made a little graphic.

[00:03:40.920] - Elna
And then underneath in the actual blog post, she just wrote my, author bio there you can use a plug in like the one here on the left.

[00:03:48.720] - Elna
You can find an author bio plug in if you're using WordPress and then just have that for every contributor post. Right. You're also going to need a canned email response to pitches.

[00:03:58.470] - Elna
So when people come and pitch to you, you have already a template, an email template to send out and then you do need a contributor information page on your site, sort of like a write for us page.

[00:04:12.680] - Elna
All right, so a great canned response in Gmail is easy to create. You write it all out in your email and then you can click the three dots at the end at the bottom there, and then it goes next to the trash, sorry, and goes to templates and then same draft as template and then a save as a new template. And then you can use that. And so this is what I have here for my canned email. You can take a look.

[00:04:37.710] - Elna
When I get these people who want to guest post, this is what I usually tell them. The process, the logistics.

[00:04:48.090] - Elna
I'll add you to the user profile and WordPress and then you can get a login information email to you. All right. And then I just tell them to write your blog post in the email or in the WordPress and then submit it for review.

[00:05:06.940] - Elna
All right, now on the right front page on your website, you can include what your blog niche is about what type of topics you want guests to write for. You can be specific on this contributor blog. I do say I specifically want saving money tips, self care tips, newborn toddler tips, postpartum tips, health tips and personal stories.

[00:05:27.140] - Elna
Those are the types of contents that I have been getting. So if you, for example, want to kick up and ramp up your SEO and you have certain keywords in mind, then you can put those out in here. Like I want things all about breastfeeding challenges and pregnancy scares. And, you know, I want those. Things to get ready for your big hospital trip as a pregnant person, you know, like you can add those sort of idea topics and then you can get guest posters to write those things for you.

[00:06:01.000] - Elna
And then the blog post format, so I tell them I want a thousand words, at least because that's good for ranking potential in Google, Google does want the most valuable type of content to share in the SERPs, in the search result pages.

[00:06:16.870] - Elna
And then that usually is long form writing. All right, in the background of WordPress, you can make a new user, so again, when someone pitches, they sign up, they look at the WordPress, write up page there, and they see the email address or contact form. And then you get the email and you send a canned response saying that you will set up this process, this profile for them.

[00:06:42.300] - Elna
So in the backend. You can just go and add a new user. And then make sure to get their information through that email, so their email address, their name, their blog, and if they have a gravatar associated with it, with that email address, if they don't, then you can just ask for headshot. And then at the bottom, make sure to change this role from subscriber to contributor so that they can actually contribute to your blog.

[00:07:10.650] - Elna
All right. Now, the second way you can save time is by repurposing your content. All right. So I hope that the first thing of opening up your blog to contributors is something that you'd be thinking about.

[00:07:24.870] - Elna
You don't have to make an entire contributor blog, but you can open it up maybe every month you can have two guest posts and then you can write two posts. Again, that saves time for you. All right. And then this way, I use this method a lot because I do have several blogs and several email lists and several Facebook pages, and I just need ways to repurpose what I've already created.

[00:07:56.820] - Elna
All right.

[00:07:57.180] - Elna
So you can repurpose old blog posts, emails or videos.

[00:08:00.870] - Elna
So like I said over my freelance writing blog, since I have over 100 blog posts, I take some of those points from a few blog posts and put that in a new email for my email list.

[00:08:12.930] - Elna
So, for example, over here is a blog post on 11 Ways to stay positive as a new freelance writer. It was written a while back, and so in my email that I send out, I might have a little blurb.

[00:08:25.490] - Elna
So here how you can stay positive during your new journey to freelance writing.

[00:08:29.310] - Elna
And then I give a couple of those tips that I put that were already in this blog post, and I may add more relevant information that's more current. All right. But I do repurpose those things and I might add only three.

[00:08:42.570] - Elna
And I may link to that post if you want more ideas to stay positive.

[00:08:47.730] - Elna
Check out my, my post here and then I would link to this post. You can do that as well.

[00:08:53.380] - Elna
Now, don't worry, not every email subscriber has read your entire blog.

[00:08:57.780] - Elna
So if you're worried about that, you can use old blog posts as idea starters then or add more to them in email.

[00:09:05.250] - Elna
So again, I wouldn't worry too much about that because you're repurposing your content that people are just going to think that you're repurposing content, find a way to use it in a new medium.

[00:09:19.050] - Elna
So turn a blog post into a Facebook live video, for example. You can do that or vice versa. Summarize a Facebook live video. All right.

[00:09:28.890] - Elna
And then you can drop an email about that. You can also repurpose parts of a blog post into a brand new post. All right.

[00:09:39.510] - Elna
So since my freelance writing blog is a highly niche site for freelance writing and writing jobs, I often write about the same topics over and over again.

[00:09:48.970] - Elna
OK, my entire blog on elnacain, which is my freelance writing site, is all about getting started, freelance writing.

[00:09:55.800] - Elna
And I've had that site for many years now and I still write about the same topics about jobs.

[00:10:04.110] - Elna
Becoming a writer and writing tips basically.

[00:10:07.530] - Elna
So to make each post unique, I have to pull from existing posts and add more to them or put a spin to them. So I often write about practicing writing in many posts. So a lot of the things that I teach is, you know, make sure that you practice writing every day.

[00:10:22.170] - Elna
That's something I say constantly throughout my blog posts.

[00:10:26.490] - Elna
So I naturally created a blog post on improving your writing skills. All right. So, for example, up here, practice writing, the third subtopic was in a blog post that I wrote. And then I have it here write every day. It's just structured differently. Right. So you can do repurposing that way. All right. And repurposing also, you can do with video.

[00:10:50.730] - Elna
So the third method, you can save time. With your writing is use video instead. All right, so Facebook lives are easy ways to create content when you really don't have time to write a post. I use video a lot when I just physically don't have an hour or two to write a blog post. Right.

[00:11:11.010] - Elna
So, as I say, can take up to three hours for me to write a long piece of article. So but it only takes me about 30 minutes to do a Facebook live, mostly twenty five minutes.

[00:11:21.620] - Elna
So if I know I can't write, I don't have a block of time, I start doing quick videos to keep my audience up to date with my life, but to also be in the minds of my readers often.

[00:11:32.210] - Elna
All right. So you can do an Instagram live if you want. You can even do like the Instagram reel's doesn't have to be like a live video at the time.

[00:11:42.560] - Elna
You can post a YouTube video or do a Facebook live.

[00:11:46.220] - Elna
All right. So Facebook lives they're for me, the easiest ways to create content when I don't have time to write a post so as I was saying, takes up to three hours for me to write. So here I have a video that I did over in my Facebook group, Mom to Mompreneurs, it's the first step to SEO for new bloggers. And then, I don't know, I'd say probably a few months later, I created a blog post called What is SEO: Getting Your Site ranking in 2020.

[00:12:16.670] - Elna
So then this was the video that I got inspired by to write that post. And in that post I put the video in it. All right, so we covered repurposing.

[00:12:30.560] - Elna
So think about all the different ways that you can start repurposing your content, using video to write a blog post, using a video to create an email, using a video to create another video.

[00:12:41.240] - Elna
Maybe you can do sort of like a pre step of the of the video that you just did kind of thing.

[00:12:49.250] - Elna
All right. You can do a blog post, a video blog post, an email, lots of different ways to repurpose your content.

[00:12:54.980] - Elna
The fourth way you can save time with writing is to create a series. And I like to do this at least once a year. So and it's a fun way for me to creating a series over the same topic. So for me, I can focus on one aspect or several aspects for each blog post, and I can make each one around 800 to 1000 words.

[00:13:15.530] - Elna
So sometimes having five 800 word blog posts, so like one every week is better than having no blog posts for two months.

[00:13:25.040] - Elna
So think about that. Even though they're shorter pieces of content, they're delivered more consistently. That is good for your blog than to not write anything for a few months because you're writing this big, big, huge guide.

[00:13:38.060] - Elna
So I usually run my blog series at the end of the year during the holidays it seems things are pretty slow right before the new year for me.

[00:13:45.990] - Elna
So I like to just I have a bit of time to just drum up a theme and then create a series over it. So one year I did Pinterest all about Pinterest marketing. And so I did 12 days, six to 12 days of Christmas, 12 days of blog posts for you.

[00:14:01.730] - Elna
And every single day I posted a blog post and they're all different topics, all about Pinterest, one about description's, ones about hashtag, sections, how to get more saves, mistakes, how you can make money, Podcasts for bloggers that are about Pinterest.

[00:14:22.190] - Elna
I mean, I just sort of sat there and drummed up what I wanted to write about for you.

[00:14:28.160] - Elna
You can find blog post ideas around a topic using Pinterest. So, for example, if you want to do a series on breast feeding advice for your parenting blog, you can search that topic on Pinterest and check out the tiles to get blog post ideas. So breastfeeding tips here in Pinterest. And underneath, there's all these beautiful little tiles that can give you some ideas. So I just quickly looked at that and I was able to get these topics five ways to quickly boost milk supply when breastfeeding, the best breast pump for new moms that can be monetized while, eight breastfeeding mistake's beginners may not know about how to use a HACA to get more milk in a day.

[00:15:03.020] - Elna
Five easy ways to get your newborn latching the first time.

[00:15:05.660] - Elna
How to get a deplage when breastfeeding, and how to gently wean your baby from breastfeeding.

[00:15:10.580] - Elna
Now, some of these can be sort of like a ultimate guide for sure, but you can structure them in a way so that they're just easy little pieces of content to consume. All right. So the five ways to quickly boost milk supply, that could be like, you know, 800 words of these five cool little hacks that you have and then you can link to your bigger guides in that post. If you do have like a big guide on boosting milk supply, OK, you can also get ideas through keywords, right.

[00:15:42.440] - Elna
So you can use something like a free keyword tool like ubersuggest to get just some blog ideas. So I have the best breastfeeding tips for latching, breastfeeding tips for your newborn, five breastfeeding tips for short nipples. Now, the one the one thing using something like a keyword tool like this, like Ubersuggest I mean, you do have to plug in different types of keywords to get more ideas. So I just typed in breastfeeding tips and it just gave me.

[00:16:09.190] - Elna
LongTail keywords for breastfeeding tips, breastfeeding tips and newborn breastfeeding tips and new moms breastfeeding tips, and so I wouldn't rely solely on a keyword tool like this Pinterest seems to be a better option.

[00:16:22.450] - Elna
Now, the fifth way this does involve writing a bit more, but it's writing easy blog posts for high engagement.

[00:16:30.190] - Elna
All right. Now, the popular posts that are easy to write are list posts, OK, list posts come in all different forms. They are roundup of contributors. You can have a big roundup and have, you know, 70 bloggers or 70 artists or 70 moms contribute.

[00:16:47.170] - Elna
You can feature others instead. You can make it a huge resource. So it's a resource list post of all the tools you need to start selling or all the tools you need to work from home kind of thing.

[00:17:02.200] - Elna
It could be all about products. OK, so you can round up the best courses for, you know, learning how to sing or something like that.

[00:17:11.530] - Elna
And they can also be affiliate based, so again, you can have a roundup of the best baby bottles and then those are all affiliates.

[00:17:20.570] - Elna
So I generally write list posts as they're highly shareable and easy to write for me personally.

[00:17:26.140] - Elna
So once you have that topic, you want to list out the subtopics and write a few sentences for each. So if your post isn't long enough, like over 300 words, that's pretty much a the low end of a list post. You can add more to that list over time. All right. That's pretty much what I do. I may not start out with 87 crafts. I think I started out with like 60 or 63 crafts. And then I gradually updated it every few months or a year or something like that.

[00:17:56.750] - Elna
So now it's 87 crafts, I think the last time was 73. And then before that was probably sixty two or sixty three.

[00:18:04.800] - Elna
I also have 63 ways to live on one income. Again, this one I think I wrote all 63 ways.

[00:18:11.400] - Elna
This one took a bit of time, so I added over time. One hundred and seventy indoor and outdoor toddler activities. All right. So these high list posts. You can start with 20 and then every month or every quarter add 10 or 15 more so that by the end of the year it is a nice, beefy post. And that's when you can really start marketing it, create new pins for it, tell your list about it, because now it's you wrote it in January, but now it's, you know, November kind of thing.

[00:18:41.640] - Elna
All right, and usually this post get the most share as people just like to bookmark them, and so they'll just save them to their Pinterest boards or share them on Facebook kind of thing. Now, if you decide to feature other bloggers because you're pressed for time so you don't have the time to actually write all this stuff, you just want people to, like, tell you their their contribution, you can post in various Facebook groups or tell your list, your email list or personally email bloggers so you can ask them if they want to contribute.

[00:19:13.750] - Elna
And this is what I did of Michelle, of Making Sense of Cents. I mean, I was able to easily get her contribution just by emailing her. So I said, I love your blog and your Pinterest group.

[00:19:27.760] - Elna
I know you're the queen of affiliate marketing and congrats on your course. So I talk about my blog and I say that I'm doing a series and that I asked em if she's interested. Right.

[00:19:42.260] - Elna
So Michelle's VA or herself responded to that email and they contributed to my post, so I'm pretty sure Michelle, her VA sort of rounded up all the you know, she gets asked probably to do a lot of contributions.

[00:19:55.220] - Elna
And so she spends a week or more with, like, writing these responses for all her contributions.

[00:20:02.370] - Elna
And this is what she wrote for mine.

[00:20:03.440] - Elna
It's pretty detailed and nice on my post on Twins'Mommy. So this saves me a lot of time in writing.

[00:20:10.760] - Elna
And this will help grow your audience when you get influencers like Michelle of Making Sense of Cents to contribute to your posts, because then you can ask other influencers to contribute to that post. While I have these are the people that are contributing, you know, Michelle, Making Sense of Cents and, you know, Sarah Titus of sarahtitus and and you can list off these influencers. And so it'll get more traction. People will want to associate themselves with those influencers and want to contribute to your post.

[00:20:41.660] - Elna
All right, so the sixth way is to share one or two tips for curiosity.

[00:20:49.430] - Elna
Now, this does work really well if you have really good, juicy tips.

[00:20:54.770] - Elna
OK, so if you're pressed for time, then you can create a blog post on one or two tips, but try to make it at least a thousand words to make it valuable.

[00:21:02.240] - Elna
OK, because sometimes long list posts are daunting and they cause anxiety. Well, I know it does for me at times when I do, you know, browse Pinterest and see like two hundred and eighty, you know, blogging tips or 2,080, you know, traffic tips, I get a little overwhelmed. Like that's going to be a big post.

[00:21:23.150] - Elna
I don't have the time to read it. And so a lot of people just want a quick win. And you can do that with a blog post that shares only one or two tips.

[00:21:32.540] - Elna
And you have to frame your headline so that it builds curiosity. And this is what I did with this blog post of 2 little unknown SEO hacks for new bloggers.

[00:21:43.730] - Elna
These are unknown, not many people talk about these little hacks that I have in this blog post, and so that drove a lot of curiosity and people commented on this blog post and shared it. All right.

[00:21:56.400] - Elna
So when you start thinking of a nice, valuable tip, you might have a cool hack when your meal prepping to speed up to speed up the process, meal a hack for organizing things like that.

[00:22:08.810] - Elna
Then you can you can structure like the the number one thing I always use to get such and such and such.

[00:22:17.030] - Elna
Right. You can frame it that way. All right, and then the last tip is to know the keywords in your niche.

[00:22:27.530] - Elna
This is important if you start blogging and you're just randomly trying to figure out topics and and keyword research, it's going to be hard to get that initial boost in Google for that traffic. It's much easier to already have like a list of keywords that are searchable and that are ready made for you.

[00:22:49.790] - Elna
All right. So. For many bloggers, writing a blog post usually starts with that idea right in mind, and from there you start researching your topic, but it is a long process. So instead of writing your post this way, start having the keywords in your niche already created.

[00:23:05.740] - Elna
And that will help you easily write blog posts every week for months.

[00:23:09.070] - Elna
And I do want to introduce you to my little guide here. It's two hundred and sixty easy keywords to rank for.

[00:23:17.140] - Elna
It comes with an editorial calendar and SEO blog post format and promotion plan flow chart, the link.

[00:23:25.150] - Elna
You'll get the link. And here's a little graphic of it.

[00:23:27.790] - Elna
I mean, there's my calendar right here. And then I have about 17 various niches. I think three of them are our core niche sites and the rest are popular niche sites.

[00:23:41.980] - Elna
All right.

[00:23:42.370] - Elna
So this guide will be updated periodically to give fresh keywords, fresh ideas. And I also give you tons of blog posts, ideas for each niche.

[00:23:53.950] - Elna
I think I pick four keywords and then I give you blog post ideas within that niche.

[00:23:59.740] - Elna
All right. So many of these are popular mom blog niches like parenting or breastfeeding or homeschooling, things like that.

[00:24:07.840] - Elna
And just a quick thing to let you know that once you have those keywords in your niche, it's really easy to create blog posts.

[00:24:14.230] - Elna
So, for example, in WordPress, I just have a running list of keywords with the search result numbers. And then I just sort of. I add a color so I know that I've done them or contributors have, this is another contributor site that I have. So if I have a contributor to write it, then I will mark it.

[00:24:39.050] - Elna
So these are my other keywords that I want to eventually write for this this blog that I have its contributors site.

[00:24:44.930] - Elna
All right. So there you go.

[00:24:46.340] - Elna
Those are the seven main ways to find that time so that you can keep on blogging, since content is the main driver to get sales conversions on your blog and readership as well. All right.

[00:25:01.490] - Elna
So I hope you enjoy this.
