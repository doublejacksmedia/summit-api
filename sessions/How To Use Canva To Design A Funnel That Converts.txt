Kara, thank you so much for being a part of the summit. I really appreciate it.

[00:00:04.660] - Kara Fidd
Thank you so much for having me. I'm super excited.

[00:00:08.770] - Liz
Yeah, because I first came across you during the Rebel Boss summit. We were both part of that, and I watched your session. I was like, I've been using Canva for years, and I didn't know you could do that.

[00:00:17.460] - Liz
And I was like, what?

[00:00:21.970] - Kara
I love finding little hacks and workarounds.

[00:00:25.290] - Liz
Yes.

[00:00:25.690] - Liz
And I mean, I've kind of [inaudible 00:00:27] away from using Canva for certain things, but I learned so much, and I was like, I couldn't believe it. So I was really excited when you agreed to do this summit as well. For anyone that doesn't know, this is Kara from Simplifying DIY Design, and she just makes the design stuff for those of us that that's not our area of expertise, super easy. Can you share kind of an overview of what you're going to be covering for us today?

[00:00:49.790] - Kara
So today I'm going to be talking

[00:00:51.460] - Kara
about different steps of a funnel. So design is such a big part of all of the different steps of a funnel, and I don't think people realize how much actually goes into it. From creating the freebie to creating the landing page and the actual product itself, there's a lot of design that goes into it. So I just, like, kind of breaking down the different steps that you can take in designing a funnel that really converts, and I'm super excited to talk about it. I could talk about funnels all day and design.

[00:01:20.410] - Liz
Yeah, I can't wait to see your presentation. So, let's go ahead and dive in.

[00:01:25.370] - Kara
Hey, everyone. Thank you so much for joining me today. I am so excited to talk about funnels that convert. So really quick before we get started, about me. I'm a mom of two awesome kids. I'm a military spouse, certified in graphic design, a full-time blogger, and owner of Simplifying DIY Design. And I specialize in combining my knowledge of marketing with design concepts to help people create better graphics and digital products for their blogs. Templates are my jam. I love creating them, and I love seeing what people are able to create with them. So, what we're going to talk about today is the nine essential steps of creating a funnel that converts, why it's important, and how to maximize value and conversions every single step of the way using visual techniques. So first, the first step is usually the entry point. So as you can see in the video here, that'll just kind of loop. Somebody's going to find you via a social media platform nine times out of ten. Unless they're finding you on Google, there's some kind of image that's getting them into the first step of your funnel. So they type in whatever they're looking for.

[00:02:34.610] - Kara
They see your image, it grabs their attention, they click through to your blog. So that's kind of how they're entering the first step of your funnel. So whether it be a blog post or lead magnet page, anything like that, most of the time it's going to start with some kind of visual graphic. And that means you want to make sure that every single post that you have, every single lead magnet you have, all have their own graphics for each of the social media platforms, especially when it comes to Facebook and Pinterest, and when it comes time to running ads. You don't always just want to run it right to a blog post, you sometimes want to run it to a lead magnet. It depends on what you're doing, but most of the time the entry point is some kind of visual. So some tips to kind of maximize those clicks or entry into your funnel is using really attractive photos. If you aren't very good at taking your own photos, you might want to invest in some beautiful stock photos. The image in the actual photograph itself can make a big difference, so you want it to be light, bright, crisp, and clear.

[00:03:46.890] - Kara
And if you're not really great at taking pictures, it might be something you want to invest in. Keep each platform in mind. So big, bold, readable text works awesome on Pinterest, but Facebook doesn't really like it, so they prefer very little or no text. I like to have at least some text in my Facebook, depending on what it is. If it's a blog post, I might not do any text at all. You can also test out different titles, and this is really important, especially on Pinterest. You can make several different pins with different titles. You're going to want them to be very similar so that you're actually delivering on the promise of the title, but you can kind of change up the words and restructure the title a little bit. It's kind of just how many times can I say the same thing kind of game. So if you test different titles, you never really know what's going to take off. So, I highly recommend kind of experimenting with different ways that you can phrase your title to get it to be more clickable. Keep your ideal reader in mind when choosing the design elements of your image.

[00:04:56.580] - Kara
So, if you are geared towards parents of kids, you might want to find photos and other design elements that are appropriate to that person. If you have a more professional brand, again, it's something that you want to keep in mind when you're choosing the visual aspects of any image. Remember, design is just as much about communication as actual verbal language. So you want to make sure that your images that you use are relevant to the content and the transformation that you're promising. A lot of these platforms, especially Pinterest, they can tell what the content is based on the image. So, if the image is confusing, it's not going to keyword properly, and you might not get shown in as much search results as you're hoping. If you struggle with this stuff, using a template can be a great professional jumping-off point. It can save a ton of time and help you kind of start with a professional design, and then it's very easy to customize to your brand. So the next step of the funnel is going to be the actual lead magnet, and this is where we're going to try to capture that person and convert them into a consistent reader.

[00:06:12.050] - Kara
Somebody that comes back to our site, that follows us and reads our emails, and grows to know, like, and trust us. So, this is where we want to give them a lot of value, give them a quick win, and get them on our email list. You can do this really easily design-wise, using free programs. You don't have to use anything fancy. I like, Canva. I also use Adobe InDesign, but choose the platform that you feel comfortable with because what really matters is that it's done and out there. Set it up with your email service provider so that when somebody fills out the form, they put their name and email address, and it gets delivered to them automatically. So, tips for generating a lead magnet idea, try not to overthink it. It doesn't have to be super complicated. So a couple of things to think about when you're trying to generate that lead magnet idea is what problem does your paid offer solve? So if you have a paid offer or some kind of product, you can kind of work backwards from that and try to think about the problem that the paid offer solves. And then think about the first steps, the roadblocks, the questions, concerns, things like that, that somebody is going to have about your paid offer or even just your topic in general.

[00:07:26.300] - Kara
So where does my reader need to be in order to know that they even have this problem? Maybe somebody doesn't even know that they have the problem. They need some education first. What kind of information do they need prior to being ready to get that problem solved? So again, even if you don't have a paid offer, you can think about the general problem that your avatar or ideal audience has and kind of work backward from that as well. What's another problem they might have before being ready for the paid offer that I can solve? Okay, so that would be kind of like first steps. If you don't have a paid offer, again, you can think about your most popular posts. How can you expand on them? You can think about the problems your ideal reader has and how you can provide quick wins for them. So these are things I would just make a brainstorm list, start listing out all the different things. Consider your top posts, your top topics that get a lot of traffic and sign-ups already. Start there. Use that as a jumping-off point to create a lead magnet idea that will attract the right person.

[00:08:33.560] - Kara
So, it's all about attracting a very specific person that's going to be our avatar, okay? Now, the opt-in page and the opt-in form are going to be those entry points to your actual email list. So whether it be a dedicated page like you see right here, or a form on your website, whether it be your sidebar, your blog post, your footer, wherever you have that form, you want to be promoting that opt-in. Okay? So this would be the next step. You're going to want to create a form or create a page that you can send people to. Okay? So, you can also see in this video, I have a dedicated page, but I put visual images in my sidebar so that somebody clicks on them, they go over to the page. Okay? So, if they landed on a post that maybe they didn't connect with the lead magnet in the post, but the one in the sidebar grabs their attention, that's another way to do it. You want to make it as easy as humanly possible for someone to opt into your email list. So, some tips for this to maximize those sign-ups is to create an irresistible headline.

[00:09:40.880] - Kara
You want to be able to describe that freebie and grab their attention, promise a transformation, and really sell that freebie. No, it's not something that's going to make you money immediately, but it does have a lot of potential to make you money in terms of follow-up products. So, if you're catching the right person that's going to be interested in your paid offers, whether it be a tripwire, an affiliate product, a bigger product that you have, this is an essential step to making sure these people are the right fit. So you want to make sure that you're attracting the right person in your headline. Include visual elements, usually a mockup-style graphic of the lead magnet. You can see on the page here I had a little mockup of the actual planner right here, and I had a couple more on the page itself. You can get as creative as you want. Try not to give away actual content, but make sure they know exactly what it is. And you can do that really easily using a 3D style. Not everybody is super familiar with printables and things like that, but if you can kind of give it a visual, if you can display it in a visual way, it would go a long way with perceived value.

[00:10:56.560] - Kara
So, ensure the offer itself speaks to the pain points of your ideal audience. This is, again going back to we want to be attracting the right people. It doesn't matter if you think of some amazing lead magnet that gets tons of sign-ups if those aren't the right people for your email list. Okay? So it's all about attracting a specific person. Make sure the button on your opt-in page pops. If it's too blending into your brand colors, then it might not jump off the page as much. So you want to kind of experiment with different copy on the buttons and different colors of the buttons. And lastly, check it on your mobile device. So, this is something that is commonly forgotten, to really double check what your page looks like on a mobile device, especially when running ads of any kind, because people, nine times out of ten, they're searching Facebook and Pinterest on their phone. So, how it looks on your mobile device is going to be important. You're going to want to make sure that form is really close to the top of the page. You don't want them to have to scroll far to get to that form.

[00:12:06.070] - Kara
All right, so the next step in the funnel is a tripwire. So what this is, it's essentially a low-cost, quick-win type of product that's offered right after someone signs up for your email list. So what's going to happen is they're going to put their information into the form, then they're going to be directed to a thank you page that lets them know that the freebies on the way and offers them a special one-time offer. So again, we can see an example of what one of my tripwire pages looks like. Somebody clicks through, they buy a low-cost offer. Okay? So, what this does is one, if you're running ads, it can help you make that ad money back. So if you're running ads to grow your email list, this is going to be a great way to make that money back. And then that way it's not costing you anything to grow the email list, but you can grow it a lot faster because you're able to invest in those ads. Two, it's qualifying the leads that are coming onto our email list. Okay? So people that purchase the next step of your value ladder, which is basically just a list of your offers in terms of the smallest free offers to your bigger paid offers, and you can have different steps in between.

[00:13:18.900] - Kara
So, that's what makes it a value ladder. So, we're offering somebody a chance to get a really good discount, or thanking them for trusting us with their email address, we're offering them in exchange a special offer. Okay? So, the people that sign up for that, they are going to be more likely to be repeat customers because we're now going to get the chance to wow them with our paid value. Okay? So, it's qualifying the leads coming onto the email list, and it's also making sure that we're able to kind of promote our business via ads at, hopefully, no cost. Hopefully, we're at least breaking even with this, because then we can move them up the value ladder in our email funnel. Now, if you don't have a tripwire you can still wow them with value on your thank you page. So, if you don't have a tripwire or paid offer yet and you don't feel that you're ready to make one, you can create what I call a value-driven thank you page. So, if I am running ads to warm up for like a launch or a relaunch of some kind, but I don't have a tripwire for that specific product, that's okay because I know that I'm running those ads so that I can retarget the paid product later.

[00:14:41.850] - Kara
So I'm okay with just sending people to a value-driven thank you page. So, I want to wow them, I want to start building that relationship. And what a value-driven thank you page looks like usually for me, it's thanking the person for signing up. It's giving them the opportunity to connect with me on social platforms. And I also usually try to include a video training of some kind, some kind of another quick win in addition to the lead magnet that they signed up for. So I can just start throwing value at them and letting them know what kind of stuff I talk about, and the type of value that I'm able to deliver. Some tips for the value-driven thank you page like I mentioned before, kind of just doing a short story about yourself and your why. That's kind of establishing a connection, establishing that know, like, and trust for your new subscriber. Include a personal photo of yourself, a headshot, getting somebody familiar with you and what you look like. Include links to your best articles that people might find helpful. Create a favorite resources page that you can link to.

[00:15:50.320] - Kara
And this is great for education and value for your audience, but also it's a good spot for affiliate links. You can also link your favorite affiliate products directly on the thank you page via a recommendation tile, where they have the little graphics and things like that. And you can talk briefly about which each one is. And again, like I said, I like to link my social media profiles. You can link to your podcast, your YouTube channel, whatever you have going on just so that people are able to connect with you on different platforms. And then you can also, like I suggested, that I do for my value-driven thank you pages, make some kind of value video and embed it on the page. I did mine via Facebook and then that way when somebody watches it, they get put into that re-target audience of people that watch 3 seconds or more of the video. So, the next step in the funnel is going to be our welcome sequence. So, this is where we're going to start nurturing the new subscriber with a value-driven email sequence. So this is usually like two to three days of emails.

[00:16:59.770] - Kara
I like to include more freebies tips and personal information about myself to again, work on establishing that connection and getting the person to know, like, and trust me. So, now it's time to level this up. If you've gotten all of the steps up to this point, so you've got your freebie, your tripwire, you should at least be starting to generate some money with that, which is awesome. But now it's time to take it to the next step, and this is where we're going to come up with an actual product. Digital products are the way to go. They are amazing. You can monetize with affiliate products, but I have never been as successful with affiliate products as I have been with my own digital products. Everybody is different. Everyone's site is different. It can be different for you. This is what works for me and this is what I'm teaching with my topic, product design. So I love digital products and you're really just spending your time to make them. And then the beauty is that you can sell them over and over and over again without having to do much more work. I mean, you do have to put in some effort to keep your product updated and deal with customer service issues and things like that, but you're in control of all of it.

[00:18:18.270] - Kara
Unlike affiliate products, you are in control of the sales page, you're in control of the price, you are in control of whenever you run promotions. You're in control of how you treat your customer after they've purchased from you. You are in so much more of a position to help the audience that you worked really hard to build. So, that's why I'm so passionate about product design. So, once you feel established with an engaged audience that's super targeted, you are ready for product design. You don't need to wait for some magic number. If you feel you're ready, go for it. I like to start by surveying to see how my audience learns best, what types of products they like to purchase, that kind of thing.  What have they tried before? What didn't work for them? Why didn't it work for them? This is a lot of information that is helpful when it comes down to trying to plan out how we're going to solve this problem for them. So, again, some tips, things to ask yourself to generate that winning product idea. What are your people already asking for? What is the problem they need solved?

[00:19:24.670] - Kara
Why does it even matter to them that the problem gets solved? What types of things has your audience tried before? Why did it work? Why didn't it work? How can you improve it and make that better? And how can you get them over the roadblock that they're experiencing and get them to that final destination, that transformation, the place that they want to be? We're not talking like earth shattering, solve world hunger types of problems. It can be as simple as how can you get someone to finally stick to the meal plan. Whatever your audience is struggling with, you can find a unique way to solve it for them. Even if the idea itself has been done a million times before, no one's going to do it your way, and no one's going to present it the way that you would, okay? So don't put yourself down that, oh, well, I can't make a menu plan or whatever because it's been done a million times before. But maybe the way that you present it in your strategy for it is different enough where the person would actually see success, even though they tried it a million times before.

[00:20:33.530] - Kara
So, here's what I like to do when it actually comes down to designing it. Okay? So, before I even start designing, before I even open my computer well, I do have to open the computer to write it out, but before I open Canva or InDesign or whatever design program I'm using, I want the content written out. I like to also do an inspiration session. So, I like to go on Pinterest, Creative Market, things like that, and type in the idea, the topic, the type of product, and just start getting ideas for design, for presentation, for promotion ideas, and keep them in like a Trello board or whatever you use for organization. I like Trello. I use it for everything. This is not meant ever to copy somebody, but it's just meant to kind of get the creative wheel spinning. Okay? So, we can look at layouts and we can look at colors, and we can look at - okay, a lot of people are designing it this way. Maybe I don't want to do it that way, I want mine to stand out. We could take notes of what we like, what we don't like, why we like and don't like it.

[00:21:43.350] - Kara
It's a really good way to get the wheel spinning. So then, I'm going to map out my product on paper. So, I'm going to take out a paper, I'm going to take out a pencil with an eraser and start kind of mapping out where I want things to be. And that way, when I go over to Canva or InDesign or whatever, I have something to refer to. So I can just copy and paste the stuff that I've written out, put it into my design program, and lay it out the way that it is on my paper. It makes it so much easier. So, you can even do that. I use my own templates all the time, actually, because I've already designed it so I might as well. Saves a lot of time. But I still like to do this because then I can choose the template that I need that has the closest jumping-off point, and I can start there, and I cut out a lot of that process. I also want to make a decision before jumping into this about the colors and the fonts that I'm going to use and they're usually on brand.

[00:22:42.670] - Kara
The only time I've ever really gone off brand for a digital product of any kind has been a seasonal product. I like to choose the colors that go along with the season that I'm creating content for. So usually it's red and green, but I like the shades of the colors to be pretty complementary with my brand. So, I usually start with my brand colors and kind of tweak them until they get to where I want them to be. So then, the next step of your funnel is going to be actually creating the sales page design. So, once you've gotten your product, set up, created, and launched, it's time to automate those sales with the funnel. You can add the sales sequence to the end of your welcome value email. So, somebody has gone through your welcome sequence, you've established a connection. Hopefully, you've gotten them to reply to you. Maybe you started a dialog, you've helped them with something, a question, anything like that. You're starting to develop that relationship, and now we want to move them up that value ladder. So, we're going to offer them this next product. That's why you want to kind of create a separate sales page for that.

[00:23:54.990] - Kara
So, what I do with the sales page is, one, it has a unique code so I know that the people using the code either to get a discount or to get bonuses, that's specific to the email sequence. So, I know that they're coming in from the email sequence. So, sales are generated from that email sequence, and that way I'm able to calculate the conversions and work on it that way. So, I want this sales page to be completely separate from what somebody would see if they just went over to my teachable shop. Okay? Some visual elements you might want to include to increase conversions with that sales page is including stock photos, beautiful photos. Either it kind of visually represents the transformation. It can visually represent frustration, pain points, things like that. You can include product mockup images like we discussed with the lead magnets. Countdown timers are good. I always use a countdown timer for my tripwire sales pages. You can do testimonial graphics, videos. I love including videos on my sales pages. And it's not always just me talking at somebody. Sometimes I'm giving them a sneak peek of what the actual product is and things like that.

[00:25:13.890] - Kara
You can do a personal photo headshot, any other graphic that you might want to include. So, if you're offering a special offer, like a discount or a flash sale of some kind, you can include the graphic that'll say, 'Oh, special offer for new subscribers', or 'Special limited time offer', 'Special discount', that kind of thing. And then, when you run live flash sales or you're relaunching, stuff like that, you can kind of make a duplicate of that sales page and then swap out the graphics. So, it kind of saves time with all the other things that you'll need to do. So next, we're going to have the actual sales sequence. So, this is going to be added to the end of that value email so that we can automate those sales to be happening on a routine basis. Okay? So, you can experiment with what works for you. Maybe you want to offer a discount, maybe you want to offer exclusive bonuses. I do recommend that you have some kind of urgency. So, if you want to offer them a discount for a couple of days, if you want to offer them bonuses, that kind of thing, that's going to go away after a certain time is done,

[00:26:23.450] - Kara
you can do it that way. Always remember to continue providing value. Educate the person why this product is going to make a difference for them. Address any objections. Give people incentive to buy. Okay? Now, the last step is an optional step. You don't have to do it, but I do find this works really well on my funnel sales. Okay? So, what I do after I offer that product to the email list, the new person has now signed up for a freebie, they've been introduced to a tripwire, they've gone through a value sequence, and now they've been offered a product. If they buy that product, I have another product that I will offer them for a steep discount as a thank you for buying that previous product. It's usually highly related or a next best step. So, it's going to want to be something that makes sense to the person that they'll be like, 'Oh yeah, that's awesome, that's a great deal, I'll definitely grab it'. Maybe they were thinking about that they wanted it in the first place and now they get shown this offer for 50% off or whatever kind of incentive you want to give them to buy on that page, they're going to be super excited about that.

[00:27:44.300] - Kara
So, I do find that using the platforms that have one click upsell, like Teachable or Podia, where they give you the option to add an upsell to the confirmation page, that does not convert as well as actually redirecting someone to a dedicated upsell page. My dedicated upsell page looks very much like a tripwire page, just a little bit longer depending on the size of the product. It's going to have a countdown timer that redirects away from the page when the offer is expired. And I'm also going to include this button at the bottom that's going to continue them to their purchase. So, if they don't want to buy it, that's fine, but I don't want to make it really difficult for them to get into the product that they already purchased either. So, I'll just include that button at the bottom. If they've decided to purchase it, that's great. They've gone up another level in your value ladder. They've gotten a deal and you've gotten more income. So, if you've noticed that between the lead magnet design, the image, the entry point image designs, the product designs, all of that stuff, even the sales page design, design is a major common denominator in all of the different steps of a funnel.

[00:29:03.150] - Kara
So is product creation. So, again, that lead magnet, that tripwire, that product all falls under product creation. And I do have a free Product Creators Quickstart kit for everybody that watches this presentation, and Elizabeth is going to share with you how you can grab that for free.
