[00:00:00.000] - Liz Stapleton, Host
All right, guys, thanks for joining me for this session with Julie Chickery. I'm so excited to be here. Thank you so much, Julie, for doing this. How are you?

[00:00:08.650] - Julie Chickery
I'm wonderful, and thanks for having me. I'm excited. 

[00:00:12.400] - Liz
Yeah, I'm super pumped for your session because you're diving into... I feel like the tech side is never really covered that much. You get told, "Oh, use Yoast and use Akismet." And you're maybe told why, but you're not told, "Okay, what settings do I do? And what should I adjust? And why are they, how are those settings important?", and so that's what you're getting into, right? I'm super excited to see that.

[00:00:36.800] - Julie
Yeah, I always had people asking me, I want to start a blog, but I don't really know how, and I would look around for resources for them. And there's so many great resources about doing things like monetizing or why you should have a blog, but not the actual hands-on, "this is how you do it." And there are some free resources that'll get you started. But this course is really aimed, that I have, is really aimed towards people who don't really feel comfortable with that self-taught type of thing.

[00:01:04.350] - Liz
Yeah. So that's your course and we're not getting quite into that. But you're going to dig into plug-ins because it's a good point you made. I remember when I first started blogging, I had less than a clue of what I was doing.

[00:01:15.350] - Julie
Yeah.

[00:01:15.620] - Liz
And my brother was super computer savvy. And I was like, "How do you do a drop-down menu?" Or, "How do you do this?", and he'd go and try to do something. And I'm like, "There's no way every blogger out there is coding." Like there's gotta, and I was like, "Oh, there's these things called plug-ins. you know." So you're going to be digging into plug-ins with your presentation. I'm super excited and people can... You know, we'll talk afterwards. But why don't you go ahead and get started?

[00:01:41.420] - Julie
Yeah. So I'm going to talk about a couple of different aspects around plug-ins. First off, I'll cover some of the top plug-ins that you need to have, like you mentioned, Yoast, so obviously I'll be talking a little bit about things like search engine optimization and even table of contents. But I will also get into a little bit of the how-to so that people see also how do I even find a plug-in? How do I vet a plug-in? Because there's a million plug-ins out there for any one task that you might want to do. So how do I know if that is a good plug-in or not? And then how do I get that darn thing on my site? Whether I have a WordPress site or Squarespace site, where do these plug-ins go anyway? So I'll cover a little bit of all of that.

[00:02:25.830] - Liz
Awesome. Well, let's go ahead and get to it.

[00:02:27.310] - Julie
So are you ready to learn more about plug-ins? In this session, I'll start by explaining what plug-ins are and how they can help your blog. When used properly, plug-ins will allow you to customize your blog any way you want. After explaining a bit about plug-ins and what they can do for you, I'll talk about the differences between the free and premium plug-ins and explain when it might make sense to pay for those premium versions. Then I'll help you navigate the more than 55,000 plug-ins in the WordPress directory by showing you how to find and then assess them. I'll also make some recommendations of plug-ins that I think every blog needs, but I'll focus more on the type of plug-in and the functionality that is essential.

[00:03:07.470] - Julie
First, let's talk about what types of things plug-ins do. Your theme determines the overall look and feel of your blog, but plug-ins extend that. They are tools that expand what you can do with your WordPress site without having to manually write code. There is virtually no limit to what you can do with WordPress plug-ins. If you want to do it, there's probably a plug-in for it. For example, common plug-ins to back up your WordPress   site. They help optimize your posts for search engines. They compress images and help save space. They add social media sharing buttons and create forms quickly and easily. In a minute, we'll take a look at the WordPress directory, and you'll see just how many plug-ins there are, and many of them will be free. So you might be wondering, why would you want to pay for a plug-in? Well, there are several reasons. While there are thousands of plug-ins available for free from the plug-in directory, paid plug-ins provide additional support and documentation. They also provide regular updates, and they have developers that work on maintaining the security and the compatibility of those plug-ins with the latest version of WordPress, as well as with themes and other plug-ins. Now that you have a basic idea of how plug-ins can help, let's take a look at how to find and assess them. The WordPress directory is the starting point for most people. It has over 55,000 plug-ins available, which is great, except that this abundance also makes it difficult to find that perfect plug-in. What I will do throughout this session is introduce you to a plug-in type, then take you to the WordPress directory to help you find and assess the right one for your blog.

[00:04:40.450] - Julie
We'll start with backup plug-ins. These are so important because they protect your content. There is nothing worse than losing all your hard work to a server crash, website malfunction, or a hacker. That's why using a plug-in that performs at least some basic backup is so important. Here are some functions to look for in a good backup plug-in. Automatic backups that allow you to schedule how often you want these WordPress backups of your website files and your WordPress database. The ability to store your backups in a cloud service like Dropbox or Google Drive. And one-click restore buttons that are especially helpful if something happens. The directory is found at wordpress.org, and you simply toggle to plug-ins. Then you enter a search term, and this is going to help you find a plug-in that meets that need. In this case, we'll search for backups. I like finding plug-ins that offer both free and premium levels. That allows you to start using them for free with a good degree of certainty that they'll work well, because these free plug-ins are used as lead generation for the company's paid options. They want them to work well so that eventually, you'll want to purchase the advanced features that come with their premium versions. Now, we've searched on backups, and we'll see a very long list. Going back to the top of the page, just a few things that you'll see is the name of the plug-in, the number and stars of the review, a very brief description of what it does, who's created it, how many active installations there are. This lets you know how many times the plug-in is actually being used by others, and what version of WordPress it was tested in. So here you can see we have two million-plus active installations. That's great. This has really been tested out by a lot of people. Down here you see one that's only 30,000+ active installations. It doesn't necessarily mean that it's not a good plug-in, it just means that it hasn't been tested by as many people.

[00:06:34.260] - Julie
Now another one I want to show you is Jetpack. And the reason why I want to point this out is because Jetpack will come up in a lot of different plug-in searches. That's because it doesn't only do backups. It also does other things I'm going to talk about, like search engine optimization, social sharing, protection, backup security, and more. Jetpack is automatically installed on many of the different hosting companies' WordPress sites. You either have to choose to deactivate it and delete it from your installation or use it. It is used by quite a few people. There's five million-plus active installations, and it has been tested with the latest one. It doesn't have quite as many reviews. Let me just talk about a few pros and cons of using an all-in-one versus using one that's specialized. The good thing about an all-in-one is that you don't have to worry about compatibility between different plug-ins, and it might not slow down your site as much because it's only one plug-in. Although that does depend on the developer. Sometimes, even though it's just one, it can slow down your site, and I'll talk later about how to test for that. The drawback is that it might be stretched in too many different directions, and it might not be as effective as some that are made specifically to combat one issue. I'm not going to say that one is better than the other. If you go and read about it online, you'll find plenty of people talking and making an argument for each case. I use UpdraftPlus, so let's take a look at that one and see why I chose it. Once you click into a plug-in, you'll see four different tabs: details, reviews, support, and development. This is great because it gives you more information in each category. If you're having problems, when you'd come to support, you'll want to read reviews to see how well it's performing. And then you come over here and it just gives you at a glance some of the things that we saw on the front page. I always look at how recently it was updated. You don't want something that was updated six months or a year ago. You want to see that it's being updated regularly, which WordPress versions it works on, and which one it was tested up to, it needs to be the most current. Now, the great thing about UpdraftPlus is that it not only allows you to do automatic backups to the cloud, which almost every backup plug-in is going to allow you to do. But one thing that goes a step further is it has that restoration that I was talking about, so you can restore something very quickly. Almost all of the plug-ins that I'm going to show you here today have a video that very briefly explains what it does. And before I choose a plug-in, I always watch the video to get a little more information about it. Sometimes they even show what it looks like in the site as well.

[00:09:02.100] - Julie
Once you're writing blog posts, you're going to want people to come read them. If you'd like to get more visitors to your site from search engines, you'll want to consider a Search Engine Optimization plug-in. Some functions that these SEO plug-ins perform are Site Map Help. This really helps you create an updated XML site map for your website. It also helps with a state-of-the-art schema implementation, which helps search engines make sense of your site and increase the chance of those coveted, rich results. The great thing about the plug-in doing this is you don't really have to understand all the technology behind it, or even the technical terms. It will also help you optimize your posts for keywords, key phrases, and synonyms. The goal is to have a post ranked for a certain keyword or phrase, so you have to optimize for it. The phrase is more likely to be part of a sentence, so when optimizing your content for that key phrase, an SEO plug-in is a great help because it runs a check on your content to find out if you're using your key phrase enough, but not too much. If you want to write an article that is nice and easy to read, you're going to want to use synonyms in addition throughout the text, because repeating your exact focus key phrase actually impairs readability. Using synonyms is a great way to help users understand your copy better, and search engines will recognize these synonyms as well. They'll understand that your text is still on topic.

[00:10:21.810] - Julie
A plug-in can also help you optimize your meta description, which is primarily used for search engines to show a description of your page right under that search engine result. Tailoring and writing a descriptive meta description encourages users to click your results in the search engine, even if you're not necessarily ranking at the very top position. Another great function of an SEO plug-in is the analysis that shows you a checklist of items and determines if you're using them best. For example, it'll check the article for that focus keyphrase. It'll look for external and internal links, headers and subheaders, as well as post-length. And then it will provide you with an overall score to let you know what areas you need to improve upon. You want to make sure that you're writing easy to digest, engaging content for both visitors and search engines.

[00:11:07.900] - Julie
Plug-ins specifically look for sentence and paragraph length, and active and passive voice to provide a readability analysis for you. So let's take a look in the WordPress directory, and we'll search on SEO. Now, just as before, you're going to see a very long list of plug-ins. They'll show you the number of active installations and the reviews, as well as providing a small description. I use Yoast SEO, which actually has more than five million active installations. As you can see, Yoast SEO has been working since 2008. It's currently the number one WordPress SEO plug-in. You can see that it was last updated only three days ago, so they really stay on top of it. And that's because, again, like I mentioned before, this one has not only a free, but also a premium side to it. If we come down to what it does, you'll see it does help with title and meta description, even providing templates for you. Schema implementation, helping search engines make sense of your site, the XML site maps, full control over your site's breadcrumbs. And then there are some additional premium options. It tells you how it's going to help you write content by giving you that SEO analysis that I talked about, as well as the readability analysis. And then again, several premium options like automatic internal linking suggestions, so you don't have to remember to do it, will also help keep your site in perfect shape because it's going to help with things like tuning the engine of your website, so you can focus on great content, giving you cornerstone content and internal leaking features. Again, in each one of these categories, there's premium content, and you can get premium support if you purchase that. One thing that I like about Yoast SEO is that they have the Yoast Academy. I would definitely recommend starting out with the free version of that plug-in and signing up for their free WordPress training, WordPress for beginners. It's going to help you not only with setting up the site, but getting your SEO going right. And then you can take additional training if you want. You can also sign up for their newsletter, which I do, that gives you good tips, and they have a blog about Search Engine Optimization. All in all, it's a great free way to get started. And then as you learn more about SEO and you want more robust features, then it does provide the Premium plug-in to let you take it to the next step.

[00:13:32.610] - Julie
And now that we're thinking of search engines, let's talk about the importance of Google Analytics. Most every blogger at least looks at how many visitors they receive overall. But let's talk about why you should dig even deeper by taking a deeper look at identifying which specific organic words drive traffic to your site, you can take aims to increase it. Google Analytics plug-ins give you a simple way to connect your WordPress site to your Google Analytics account. With it, you can see how site visitors find your website and what they do while they're there. With this data, you're able to capitalize on what site visitors like to keep them coming back for more. So let's look at some features that you'll want in your Google Analytics plug-ins. One is the Dashboard Reports. You want to be able to see real-time statistics in an easy to read report found right in the dashboard of your WordPress site, so you don't have to leave it. Your stats will never be skewed if you have a universal tracking system. In other words, if your site visitors switch from a mobile device to desktop, you'll still get accurate data counts. You also want to automatically track clicks on your affiliate links, your banner ads, and other outbound links, and you can do that with link tracking. And finally, you want to identify content that readers want. Google Analytics can help you eliminate the guesswork when it comes to finding out what content your visitors are interested in. Great plug-ins provide content reports that show exactly which content gets the most visits so that you can analyze and optimize it for higher conversions. Let's take a look at the WordPress directory, and we'll search on Analytics. Now again, you're going to see the same type of list that we did with the backends and the SEO. This first one right here is the one I use. It's by MonsterInsights with two million-plus active installations. You can see it's more than many of the others. Let's take a click and see more. They actually kind of show you what it looks like in your WordPress dashboard. You can see that it was just updated two weeks ago, so they stay on top of it. And you can come over here and read reviews. I always like to read not only the highest star reviews, but the lowest star reviews as well, because I want to see those people that did have a problem with it. What was it that they didn't like about it? That will help me make a better assessment on whether it's the right plug-in for me. This tells you that they make it effortless to properly connect your WordPress site with your Google Analytics, so you can start making data-driven decisions to grow your business. Again, those reports are right inside your WordPress dashboard, so you don't have to go and learn Google. That's why not only small businesses, but big companies use it as well. And again, there's a video, which I always recommend that people watch. Below that, they talk about the ease in setting it up, as well as the different reports that you can see, so I just want to show you a couple because it is really some great functionality. There's an audience report that helps you get to know your visitors. So, not only seeing where they came from, but demographic reports as well. You can see age and gender, also behavior reports. You want to know what keywords that they were searching for and where they came from, and when they were on your site, did they link to other content that you had? You want to see which content gets the most visit, and also how long people are staying on each individual page. If you have e-commerce, you're going to want to know that as well. And a little later, we'll talk about forms, and this can give you more information on which forms people are filling out. I definitely think that MonsterInsights is a great Google Analytics plug-in for WordPress.

[00:16:58.950] - Julie
Every great blog has plenty of photographs, but did you know that images tend to take up the majority of your website's page weight? Without image optimization for speed and performance, your loading times will suffer. Some features to look for in image optimization plug-ins is something called lossless compression. This is when they strip unused data without affecting image quality. It can also have image resizing, where you set a max width and height, and large images will scale down as they're being compressed. You also want to be able to quickly locate images that are slowing down your site with different reports, as well as the ability to optimize images, even if they're not located in the Media Library. So let's take a look in the WordPress directory for an image optimization plug-in. Now, as you can see with these, there's not quite the volume of installations, 700,000; 40,000; 200,000. We're not seeing the multi-millions here. One of the reasons is because some bloggers,  actually, I should say many bloggers, actually optimize their images for size before they upload them to their blog. So I do that now. One of the great thing about these types of plug-ins, though, is it can help you after the fact. So if you didn't pre-optimize, if you didn't know about it and you had your blog for a number of months, and you already have images up there, and you don't want to go back to all them, you can use an image optimizer like Smush that will let you go back and bulk optimize. This one does actually have more than a million active installations. It is updated regularly, and you can see which version it works for. And the great thing is it does have the lossless compression that I talked about. It also has something called Lazy Load, which defers to off-screen images if you want. They also have the Bulk Smush, so optimizing up to 50 images at a time. So if you want to go back and retroactively optimize your images that are already uploaded to your blog. And many other features. A good thing to point out here is that it'll process all your files, which is PNG, JPEG, and GIF files. That's good to know because different bloggers have different preferences. I personally use JPEG for my blog. I don't have a photography website. I have a blog. I'm providing written content, and I want to supplement it with photographs. But these photographs aren't meant for people to download and hang up on their walls, so they don't need to be super large. That's why I use JPEG to begin with so that they're smaller before I even upload them to my site. It also helps you to preserve image quality because of the way that they actually reduce the file size. And there's a video here that explains that, and I definitely recommend, if you're considering this plug-in, that you watch the video. It will also compress them in any of the directory, and it lets you know that it is compatible with your favorite themes, builders, and media library plug-ins, because they have been around for a while.

[00:19:44.170] - Julie
Now, we all want our blog visitors to share our blog as well as our individual posts on social media. So let's make it easy for them with social media sharing buttons. Some of the features that you'll want to look for are things like theme design buttons, which give you the ability to select social media logos that will have a really uniform look across your entire website. Floating buttons are also a great approach. Static buttons are typically at the top of a blog post and at the bottom of a blog post. But many of your readers might come from a social engine search or a Pinterest search looking for just a specific answer, and they might browse through your blog and get halfway through, find the answer they want, and leave. Well, you still want to encourage them to share that, and a floating button follows them as they scroll down through the page. Another thing that encourages people to share is counters. By seeing that other people have shared on social media platforms like Facebook, Pinterest, Twitter, Instagram, it encourages them to do the same thing as well. Let's go to the directory and take a look at some social media sharing plug-ins. We'll search on Social Sharing. As you can see, again, there are a little bit smaller numbers, 200,000; 100,000. Now here we are back to Jetpack for WordPress. Remember we talked about this earlier? It's five million-plus active installations. It does a number of things. So if you had chosen that all in one, you wouldn't be searching for a separate social media sharing buttons, but it might not give you as many options with what you can do in the design and the floating buttons. So let's look over here at Social Media Share Buttons and Social Sharing Icons, which has 200,000 active installations. As you scroll down, again, there's a video and it tells you that it lets you share for email, Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, YouTube, and 200-plus other social media platforms. Who even knew there were that many? Now it tells you again that it's a free plug-in, but there's also a premium version, which, like I said, allows you to know that usually the free is pretty darn good because they're trying to convince you with that to buy their premium. The free also carries you through that learning curve and lets you decide if you're satisfied with that or if you want to go further. So I never say jump to the premium. I always say try out the free first and see how you like it. And at the end of this presentation, I'm going to specify some best practices and tests that you can do as you're trying the free version before you make your final decision. Now it gives you a list of all the different things you can do, like different designs that I talked about. Having several actions for one social media share icon so your Facebook can lead visitors to your Facebook page and give them the opportunity to like it, as well as opportunity for them to share on their social media sites. Also allows you to have those floating or sticking social media icons. Now notice it'll also let you sign up for email. We're going to talk about that very next slide. It is going to be about contact forms. So just hold that thought. You might want to use something specifically designed for that. One last thing that I do want to point out here, though, is that GDPR compliance is very important if you're operating a blog where you have visitors in Europe. So if you want to learn more about social media aspect of GDPR compliance, they actually have a really good page that gives you that information.

[00:22:52.140] - Julie
A contact form is one of the most important elements you need on your website. And using a good free form builder can actually skyrocket your website's growth. So what are some features that you want to look for in a form plug-in? Well, one might be templates, prebuilt templates that allow you to make it very simple to just get started right away. Later, if you want to have a visual builder that allows you to drag and drop and get a little more creative in your forms. But it absolutely has to be mobile-friendly, so that your forms will look great on all devices, whether it's mobile, tablet, laptop, or even desktop. Finally, you do want to have that email integration. So at some point, you're going to want to start building an email list, and choosing a plug-in that can integrate with your email marketing service will make things simpler all around. Let's go back to the directory and look at some forms plug-ins. As you can see, forms are very common. Here we have five million-plus active installations, three million-plus active installations. Again, you can also look at the number of reviews. This is the one that I use, which is by WPForms. It also has a free and premium version. It's mobile responsive, highly optimized for web and server performance. You can see it was last updated a week ago. Again, there's a video. The great thing about once you click on the video and then pause it is that you will get this thing that says "more videos". And check this out, "how to create multiple columns in your form layouts", "how to create a user registration form", "how to use 'and/or' conditionals in your form". What this is letting you know is that they have an actual YouTube channel that provides free support for their forms. When you go over to the YouTube channel, you can just click right here on the title. What it'll do is bring up their YouTube page. Then you can click on videos and you can actually see all of the videos they have, which is basically free support and free training. Who doesn't love that?

[00:24:50.200] - Julie
No one likes spam. But did you know that excessive spam comments can also hurt your website's rating with Google, as well as cause security problems? You can take control of that with an anti-spam plug-in. Some of the features that you'll want to look for in anti-spam plug-ins are the ability to automatically check all entries in a contact form and filter out the ones that look like spam. You also want them to be able to do the same thing with all the blog comments. You want to be able to have automatic options, so that you can set up a discard feature to outright block the worst spam. That'll save you disk space and it'll speed up your site, and the ability if you'd like to approve comments, so you can determine when and what type of comments you want to approve. Like maybe the first time an individual has ever posted a comment to your website, you have to approve it first. Then you can set a rule that after that, they're automatically approved. Let's go to the directory and search for some of these anti-spam plug-ins. Here you can see we have 200,000; 100,000, and here is Akismet. Akismet anti-spam, five million-plus active installations, is probably one of the most popular, and it's the one I happen to use. It shows you right up here with a quick visual what happens if, that visitors submit comments on your blog, or on your contact forms. It runs through Akismet, and then it tells you if it's spam. It does it automatically if you set up the rules that way so that you don't have to constantly go in there every day and delete out the spam. It will tell you again when it was last updated and what WordPress versions it works for. This tells you that Akismet checks your comments and contact form submissions against their global database of spam to prevent your site from publishing malicious content. Because when people put comments on your blog and it gets approved, then those links are there for your followers to click on. That's another reason why you don't want spam up there. You can automatically check it and filter it out, but it can also give you a status history if you want to go back and look at it. If you have moderators, you can see the number of approved comments for each one. Then again, the URL shown in the comment body, to reveal hidden or misleading links. Also, you're going to need to get an API key to use it. It's very simple. There's a tutorial when you do it inside WordPress, and the keys are free for personal blogs.

[00:26:58.140] - Julie
Plug-ins are great resources because they allow your site to do things it otherwise wouldn't be able to do. But the more plug-ins you have, the greater the risk of problems occurring within your site. And plug-ins can conflict with other plug-ins, WordPress, or even your theme. I want to cover some best practices for you to help you have the most success with your plug-ins. Since plug-ins have the potential to create security gaps in your site, you want to be sure the ones you choose have been properly vetted by knowledgeable developers who stand behind their work and professional support. That's one of the reasons why it's really great to use a plug-in that has both a free and a premium version because you know that they are making money from it, eventually, at least. So they're working hard to make both versions really good for you. In addition, each active plug-in does slow down your site by some amount. Imagine if it just slowed down the site by five milliseconds. If you had 20 active plug-ins, that means that every page would be a 10th of a second longer to load than if there were no plug-ins active, and it would become exponentially greater than that the more plug-ins you had. What you need to do is conduct speed tests. Before you install a plug-in, run a speed test on a site called pingdom.com. It's very easy. It'll give you an accurate reading. Then you can just write it down or take a screenshot. Install one plug-in and then run a speed test and check it again. You'll do that each time. If a plug-in adds significant amount of time to your speed site, then you're going to want to try to find a better plug-in. Another way to avoid these problems is to just not use too many plug-ins. Try to find ones that perform more than one function, but make sure they perform those functions well. If you get a large, bulky, all-in-one solution, but you only use it for one thing, it's still draining your site. What you want to do is prioritize. Now, this is one of the reasons why people pay for a premium plug-in because it typically has more robust features. Finally, you want to keep your plug-ins updated. The developers provide those updates not only to add new functionality, but also to patch security holes and to fix bugs, and to keep it updated with WordPress and your themes as well.

I hope that you found this presentation helpful. My goal over at BloggingTechMadeEasy, which can be found at bloggingtechmadeeasy.com is to show you just how easy it is to create and run a WordPress site. It is very easy to get overwhelmed with all of the technology that is required to run a blog, especially when you want to start monetizing and improving upon it. Well, I help you master those tools that you need to make your blog thrive. I do that through five modules, of four videos each, where I actually share my screen and walk you through each step of the process. What's included is WordPress basics, WordPress editing, easy graphic design, Pinterest technology, and finally, email management using Mailchimp. Each one of these lessons allows you to follow along and learn by doing. I provide helpful checklist to refer back to whenever needed. Just click "Register now" when you're ready to enroll in the course and it's priced at just $49. Thanks for attending my presentation and happy blogging.

I just want to say don't be afraid. Don't let that fear of technology hold you back. That's why I'm here to help. And I really just like to help people realize their dreams and show them. And once you, even through the little bit I shared with you right now, once you start playing around with things a little bit and aren't afraid, I really think you can go far with your blog. So thanks so much for joining me.
