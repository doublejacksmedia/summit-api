Okay, you built an email list, now what? So, I'm going to be talking about how to take back control of your email marketing in five steps. So, if email marketing has been on your to-do list, this session will give you clear, intangible strategies to clean, segment, and maximize your relationship with your subscribers. While you've built your list, you've maybe also neglected it.

[00:00:37.480] - Allea
So, as a result, maybe you're not sure who's on your list anymore. Maybe you're not sure what they're interested in. You have no clear segments. You think there's probably a lot of unengaged people who are costing you money every month and your open and clickt hrough rates aren't what they used to be. I am curious if any of these resonate with you, go ahead and drop them in the chat.

[00:00:57.750] - Allea
While this video is not live, I am here watching with you to answer your questions. So, do any of these resonate with you? If so, drop them in the chat. But this is why we are here today. In this session, I'm going to give you those five strategies for reviving and getting the most out of your email marketing.

[00:01:16.690] - Allea
First, I'd like to introduce myself. I'm Allea Grummert. I'm an email marketing strategist and conversion copywriter. I have a company called duett. I help online business owners, largely content creators like bloggers, make a lasting first impression with email subscribers through a welcome and nurture sequence.

[00:01:36.010] - Allea
So, I do that in order to engage readers, build brand loyalty, and optimize conversions for sales inside traffic. So, my background is action advertising and I got my start in online marketing when I started my personal finance blog called Ask Alley back in 2016. So, as I continued to learn the ropes of running a blog and creating content, it became really clear how email marketing is a sustainable and profitable way to connect with your audience long term. So, today, like I promise, I'm going to give you these strategies to help you take back control of your email list. What are they?

[00:02:12.430] - Allea
The first, establishing your brand purpose through a welcome sequence and promote your top content like blog posts, products and affiliates on autopilot. We're going to talk about segmenting your list for higher conversion rates and revenue. We're going to talk about cleaning up your list by removing those unengaged subscribers and ultimately create a consistent schedule for emailing your list. So, I am curious, which of these five strategies are you looking forward to? Which one stands out to you?

[00:02:44.220] - Allea
Which one are you most excited to learn about? Drop that in the comments. Let me know. Even if you only apply one of these things from today's session, just know that it's going to give you a much needed boost for your email marketing strategy. So, you don't have to do them all.

[00:02:58.560] - Allea
Even just one will be really impactful for what you're doing. We have a lot to cover though, so let's dive in. We want to create a clear picture of your brand, who you are, what you do, why this benefits your readers through an automated welcome sequence. What is a welcome sequence? Well, the welcome sequence is a proper immediate email welcome that connects subscribers with the heart of your brand and states what they should expect while being on your email list.

[00:03:30.340] - Allea
It's a really formal definition. I made it up myself. But ultimately, the welcome sequence is what subscribers will receive first, right after they join your email list, before they start getting your regular newsletters. It's automated, so you know that no matter how someone joins your list or when they join your list, they'll get this. And this sequence is anywhere from, it can be a simple one email welcome.

[00:03:54.420] - Allea
It could be three to five emails, anywhere in that range. But what it's doing is making your brand really, really clear in the eyes of your subscriber. Why is this important, a welcome sequence? Well, welcome sequence allows you to connect with new readers immediately when they're most interested in what you have to offer. It creates a valuable first impression.

[00:04:15.190] - Allea
It engages subscribers beyond them just getting their freebie and leaving. It also connects the dots for subscribers between where they are and where they could be by following along with you. And it also helps readers get acquainted with you, so they have context for what you'll do for them, why that matters, and what to look forward to receiving from you in the future. What should you include in your welcome sequence? First and foremost, make sure you're delivering your freebie.

[00:04:42.970] - Allea
Then I want you to introduce yourself. What is your mission? What will you help the subscriber do? What is your unique selling proposition? And why does this matter to the reader.

[00:04:53.970] - Allea
When they come to your site, what do you hope will change in their lives? And how are you going to be the person to help them experience that? So, what should you include in your welcome sequence? First of all, make sure you deliver the freebie if you've promised one. And then I want you to introduce yourself.

[00:05:09.300] - Allea
What's your mission? What will you help the subscriber do? What is your unique selling proposition and why does that matter to your reader? So, what are they coming looking for? What are they hoping for?

[00:05:21.220] - Allea
And how are you going to be the person that helps connect the dots for them? You can also share your top content. So, these could be blog posts, webinars, resources you want to make sure they have. Just wow the socks off of them and make them feel super welcome. I am curious if you want to drop in the chat, what's the number one freebie or content that you want every new subscriber to get from you?

[00:05:39.540] - Allea
What would make sure that they are like, heck yeah, this person knows what they're talking about and I want to keep learning from them. It also allows you to continue the connection, so you're able to cross promote. So, you're in your email marketing strategy, right? But you might also want them to follow you on TikTok or Instagram. This is a great place to include links for that.

[00:06:00.040] - Allea
And then we encourage them to follow you on other platforms as well. And once you write this, you can also ask your existing subscribers if they want your welcome sequence. You might not call it that, but say, hey, I created something new. That's a really great introduction to the kind of content you'll find on my site. If you'd like it, if you'd like to receive it, just click here and I'll get you at it.

[00:06:18.940] - Allea
It's that simple. Step Two. So your live broaddcast or newsletters send out your new content. But what if you could accomplish a similar thing, sending content to subscribers that's maybe older but still very valuable. You can actually create that similar experience through an automated nurture sequence. So, we're going to talk through why this is important and what you should actually send.

[00:06:43.390] - Allea
Nurturing your list is like a healthy pulse that keeps readers connected to you and your brand consistently. So, like I mentioned, your live broadcast or newsletter, that accomplishes on a regular basis. But now we're going to talk about how to make it automated. So, a nurture sequence is an automated email nurture sequence that sends out evergreen content to your new email subscribers, regardless of when they joined your list. I'm sharing this strategy as a way to send subscribers to your top blog content, affiliate promotions.

[00:07:13.620] - Allea
If you have a larger sales funnel, like you want to drive them to a webinar, or pitch a product, you can. And you can organize email content in either just one kind of catchall nurture sequence, or maybe you have two nurture sequences or four based on different verticals of the content you provide on your blog. We'll talk more about segmenting in a minute. But first, let's get back to your nurture sequence. These are awesome because they provide ongoing touches with your audience.

[00:07:39.940] - Allea
This way, new subscribers are regularly connected to your brand and your content. It's an opportunity to send consistent traffic back to your site and introduce them to top pages, posts, or products on your site, maybe category pages. Introduce the breadth of content that you have, and then you could also drill down into the depth of that content as well. It's a way for you to pitch products regularly.

[00:08:03.010] - Allea
This allows all new subscribers the opportunity to buy from you, or book a service, or call with you. And it keeps your audience warm and ready and primed for when you have a pitch or launch in the future. The last thing you want to do is wait until you have something to sell to them and reach out to your list. This is a way to stay connected with them, so that when you pitch something, it's not like, who's this person? Also, fun stat, nurtured leads actually make 47% larger purchases than those who are not nurtured.

[00:08:34.090] - Allea
So, it matters. So, I'm curious of all of these things, drop these at the chat. Which of these is most important to you? The ongoing touches, consistent traffic, pitching your services or products regularly, or keeping your audience warm? What should you include in this nurture sequence?

[00:08:52.870] - Allea
Let's dive down. It could be content largely that solves your readers biggest problems. If you were to be brand new to your site and people are coming with questions, what are those questions and how can you answer them through these emails? This could be your most popular content. Whether you find that out through Google Analytics or your YouTube videos with the most views, it could be your favorite content.

[00:09:14.290] - Allea
You're the expert. If you know that there are things on your site that, you're like, this would be so helpful to somebody. Or this is my favorite hack, or maybe it's part of your story. That's all important stuff that we can share with them in a nurture sequence. Then there's publicity or guest features. So, if you've been on a podcast or you wrote for a big magazine or a news source, you can include that here.

[00:09:38.250] - Allea
And what that does is it really lends to your credibility. You don't have to be braggy about it, but you can share it as a resource and in the minds of your readers, they're also going to see that as a credibility factor. Like this person knows what they're talking about. And like I mentioned, product pitches. So, these can be products of your own.

[00:09:54.460] - Allea
Or if you have affiliate partners that you want to pitch supporting that Amazon, you can't use Amazon affiliate links, but you could link to your Amazon storefront. You can also link to things like ButcherBox or depending on, like those bigger affiliates who don't have those kind of restraints on terms and conditions, you could pitch those. Step three, we're going to get a bit more advanced and discuss segmenting. We're going to talk about why segmenting your list of subscribers can actually lead to higher conversion rates and revenue. That's what I'm talking about.

[00:10:28.680] - Allea
First of all, what does it mean to segment? So, a segment is simply a group of subscribers organized based on a variety of settings. And those settings are typically tags. You could organize by like subscription day or if they've purchased something. But tags is what we're going to talk about.

[00:10:44.310] - Allea
Tagging, that's basically a way to track a subscriber's activity. So, how have they interacted with you? Have they clicked on a book a call link? Have they purchased something? Did they attend a webinar?

[00:10:55.090] - Allea
And then we're able to follow up with them on that. But what we're going to do is we're going to determine your segment based on these tags because it matters, like if they're a subscriber or if they click to say they're interested in something, that's all information we want to know, so we can send them really tailored information. These tools basically allow you to personalize the experience of each of your subscribers because it's based on whether they've interacted with you in a certain way or not. So, once you know a subscriber's preference or interest, you can send them a follow up sequence. So, a nurture sequence like what I just shared, or a sales funnel which just has a little bit of a different intention.

[00:11:36.340] - Allea
It's usually like a webinar of some sort, but either way, you want to make sure you're setting your content to the right people. If I type them in your list, we can make sure we are. It could be a nurture sequence like I mentioned, based on someone's interest or skill levels. Like for instance, I had a client who, they have a food blog, a really big food blog. And so, we segment their subscribers based on whether they are new to being a home cook or not.

[00:12:01.500] - Allea
If they're new, they get five additional ebooks that really educate them and get them excited to be in the kitchen and have the tools that they need, where everyone else just goes into a general nurture sequence. So, it's a way to create two different nurture sequences, same client, same email list, but they're getting a different experience. And like I mentioned, also a sales sequence to promote a specific, usually paid offer. By personalizing this followup, you're able to speak directly to the needs of each subscriber it's suitable for. So, if you imagine going back to that food blogging client, we're able to use really encouraging language in that beginner home cook sequence.

[00:12:37.480] - Allea
But if we use that in like a general nurture sequence, people might be like, please don't be kind of sending to me. [inaudible 00:12:41] around the blog. I know how to cut up a sweet potato. Whereas people are like, oh my goodness, I had no idea how to cut up an onion or a sweet potato. So that's what I mean by being able to personalize even the language in the emails because of what they've told you, that their skill level is where their interest is.

[00:12:58.710] - Allea
Why is it important to segment your list? I mentioned this but personalization attributes to higher conversion rates, that's higher click-throughs engagement and sales, as well as just a happier list of subscribers. And personalization just almost always performs better than generalized content. And actually, according to research for the Lyris Annual Email Optimizer Report, 39% of marketers who segmented their list had higher open rates, 28% had lower unsubscribe rates and 24% saw increased sales. So, in summary, happy subscribers open your emails, take action on your offers, and are just more favorably viewing your brand.

[00:13:39.990] - Allea
And that's what we want. So, how do you actually segment? And you're like, Allea, please don't just tell me to do this and not give me instructions. I got you. So, first, we're gonna get clear on your offer.

[00:13:50.660] - Allea
I say offer could be more than one, I'll explain. So, we need to start identifying what your offer is. You might not actually be selling a paid offer, but you might be. So, a paid offer would be something like a course, which looks more like a typical sales funnel, or if you have unpaid, it might be more like site traffic. And it's because you generate revenue through ads.

[00:14:13.500] - Allea
In summary, your offer could be a product, a digital course. It could be services. And like I mentioned, it could also be site traffic. So, things like blog posts, podcast, PDF resources, videos, things like that, in a way, is its own kind of offer, right? You're selling value.

[00:14:31.690] - Allea
So, I'm curious, if you want to comment below, what would you say is your offer? One thing to keep in mind, if you are focusing on site traffic, I want you to also keep in mind what content would you send to certain subscribers? So, this goes back to the blogging thing, right? They have beginners and more advanced folks.

[00:14:49.590] - Allea
I have another client who teaches on personal finance, so he's got investing, student loans, paying off debt, and earning more money. So, it's four different verticals, and as you can see, not all of those are super related. Somebody could test their student loan debt and not be interested in investing yet. So that in itself would be its own separate nurture sequence. Once you have your offer, what you know, what you're actually like selling, what are you going to send to them that lead them towards that offer?

[00:15:19.350] - Allea
So, you want to write your nurture sequence or sales model emails. These emails should encourage your readers to take action, and it should be something that takes them a step by step closer to learning more about your offer. That could look like them thinking about a topic related to your offer. It could be them registering for a webinar or clicking through to your site. But what steps can you lead them in to get them to do that action?

[00:15:42.300] - Allea
And it might not say, just come right out and say buy my thing, right? That's not really how it works. But how can you be getting them to think about it? Maybe taking action on reading a blog post related to a topic and then eventually down the line, you can pitch them on a paid offer. Before you can ask your list of self segments.,There are some techy things that we also need to address as well.

[00:16:01.750] - Allea
So, it's where you want to automate your sequence. Once you have your emails written, you really just want to create a tag for each of those nurture sequences, like beginner cook, general cook, something like that, or investing student loans, etc. And once you do that, you're going to set up an automation that adds that tag to a subscriber. And then once that tag is added, they get sent into that particular nurture sequence.

[00:16:26.590] - Allea
Then it's time to tell your list about it. Drop an email to your list and provide those subscribers with options to self-segment. Ask them, what are you most interested in? What can I send you information on next? And so, when they click it'll, add that tag, send them into their nurture sequence, and voila.

[00:16:44.440] - Allea
So, once you drop that email, make sure they have options to self-segment and then send that puppy out. I would say to fully implement this, I suggest you also add this email to your welcome sequence, so all new subscribers can get that kind of interaction. And then also, of course, send it to your existing subscribers as well. Step four is to clean up your list and remove your unengaged subscribers. So, if you've neglected your list for a while, there's a good chance there are some strangers on your list. So you don't know them, they might not remember you, and it's okay to let them go.

[00:17:17.100] - Allea
Why is it important to clean up your list? While your subscribers may have wanted your content at some point or another, they're no longer engaging for whatever reason. It doesn't mean that they didn't benefit from you while being on your list that whole time. It just means that they're not at that point anymore. But now these unengaged subscribers don't add any benefit to your community by being on your list.

[00:17:38.830] - Allea
They affect your data, like your open and click through rates and conversions, as well as your deliverability, like how efficiently your emails actually land in people's inboxes and not spam. They also impact with the cost of what you're paying for your email service provider. How do you find out, who these people are? Take a screenshot of this if you need to, but determine who your cold subscribers are. Either your email service platform will tell you, or you can go find out who hasn't clicked in an email in like 60 to 90 days.

[00:18:06.150] - Allea
Write a reengagement sequence. This could just be a simple two email sequence, but the goal being that you are trying to get them to click. If you can get them to click, they are engaged with you. And then you want to send just your cold subscribers through this new sequence, these two emails, and those at the end who didn't click anywhere at all, or any of your newer emails, they still haven't engaged with you.

[00:18:27.600] - Allea
It's good to go ahead and unsubscribe them. If you want, be sure to send yourself an export of that list in case you ever want to use it for any other reason. And then reuse the sequence every like, quarter or every six months, or even every year. However frequently, you would like to make sure you send people through this, it gives them an opportunity to engage with you one more time before they get removed. Allea, what do you put in this email sequence, I got you.

[00:18:52.350] - Allea
Ultimately, the goal is to reestablish a relationship with them, people who may have forgotten who you are and what you offer. So, I've got a few ideas for you here to share in these two, if not three, emails, I want you to reintroduce yourself. If your brand has changed or pivoted or your direction or niche has, make that really clear, and let them know. If you're not here for it, that's okay. You can unsubscribe.

[00:19:13.320] - Allea
But if you are here for it, stick around, more information is coming. Give them options to engage. So, instead of it just being a letter from you, link to things, so you could be linking to a free resource for training. Ask them if they need to update their email address and give them the link to do that, ask them to self-segment.

[00:19:31.000] - Allea
These are all great opportunities to get them clicking again. You can also explicitly state that you're cleaning up your list. And while you love emailing them, if they feel differently, it's okay to unsubscribe. Now, step five, much like blogging, emails produce better engagement when they're sent consistently. But if you're like a lot of bloggers, writing and sending your emails consistently is really hard to execute.

[00:19:58.110] - Allea
But I hope that this step will make the process easier for you. So, why does consistency matter? Well, email marketing allows you the time and space to create and maintain relationships with your readers over time. Regular emails help you and your brand stay top of mind because you keep showing up in their inbox. You'll maximize your resources by getting as many eyeballs as possible on your new content, right?

[00:20:21.730] - Allea
If your list is warm and you publish a blog post, you want people to see that, right? Email is a great way to do that. And then you need to be present with your subscribers between launches. So, if you're selling things, you can't just show up with a sale or a promotion and expect your list to jump at the opportunity and buy it, right. You're going to get more unsubscribed, especially if they don't remember who you are.

[00:20:40.120] - Allea
You might even get in their spam. So, what do you need in place to be able to do this? Decide. Decide what is consistent for you. Will this be two times a week?

[00:20:51.390] - Allea
Two times a month? When I was blogging on the side of my full-time job, it was two times a month. Now with my business, my goal is once a week. Sometimes it's more than that. But I'm curious.

[00:21:01.210] - Allea
I think this might be my last question. In the chat, go ahead and write down what is your commitment? What would consistent look like for you? You don't have to keep up with the Joneses, especially if you're new to blogging and you're like, I have a lot of other things to learn, and just make it a consistent pattern that will work for you. Then determine the topics you will write about in advance.

[00:21:21.750] - Allea
I use a content calendar and I also use like a content bank where I just put all of my ideas. So, QnAs that people ask on podcast, or if I'm at an event, I write down those things. And if I don't have blog posts about them, I go ahead and write them where I'll write emails about them and turn it into a blog post. That's my process. Then set aside time to write. So, I have time on my calendar for Thursday mornings to write next two Thursday's email. So, I give myself plenty of time to think on it to write.

[00:21:50.820] - Allea
And then I would also say, don't plan to like figure out what you're writing. Write the email, schedule it, and set it all out in one day. That doesn't work for a lot of people. So, if you're putting that pressure on yourself, kick it to the crew. And then lastly, I would say you can automate sending your new content through an RSS feed. If you're like, Allea, what's an RSS feed, look it up.

[00:22:11.530] - Allea
So, it will set out your brand new blog content to your subscribers, whatever days or the frequency that you want, without you having to write a new email each time,. So this is especially great if your schedule is packed and you're also creating content for your blog consistently. And it will get it into the hands of your readers and people who are excited about it, and that is what we want. Also, make it easier on yourself. Don't be afraid to keep your emails short and sweet as long as it's still valuable.

[00:22:40.830] - Allea
It's getting eyeballs on your content and it's providing value to your readers, and that is what is important. I don't want you to keep sending emails just because you haven't sent one in two weeks. Just go ahead and send the email, get those eyeballs out there and share valuable content with the people who've told you that they want it from you. Okay, we've reached the end. Those are all five steps.

[00:23:01.330] - Allea
If you have questions, if anything is lingering, go ahead and drop them in the chat here. You can always come back to it. Or if or when you join my email list, you're welcome to email me back. Just reply to any of those and it will land in my inbox. Then before you go, I do want to share about how I work with clients.

[00:23:19.240] - Allea
So, if you feel overwhelmed or excited about any of these five strategies, I want to support you. Whether like I said, overwhelmed or excited, you can feel both emotions too. But I work one on one with bloggers and content creators and just like them, I want to bring your email marketing to life. If your email marketing is not getting the results that you want or that you know are possible, we should talk. There are so many ways to strategize and position your content or product offers and share them with your subscribers.

[00:23:49.930] - Allea
So, for context, I work one on one with bloggers who have existing content that they're eager to share. They're excited about their message and how they can help their readers. They want to see a positive change in the lives of their readers. That's why they're sharing this valuable content. Some of them have a product or course, others just want to send more traffic to their list.

[00:24:08.700] - Allea
But we can promote things, whether it's content paid or unpaid, just as easily. So, my clients trust me to help them create a strategic sequence that builds relationships and brand loyalty with new subscribers and convert them towards higher traffic and sales. So, I love assisting my clients through this process, and I can help you do it too. So, when you and I work together, we would create a foundation for your email marketing. Whether that's a welcome sequence, an ongoing nurture sequence, or more than one, or a sales funnel with a webinar, any of those can be the foundation for how we get started.

[00:24:44.830] - Allea
And then from there, it's just onward growth. And of course, I also make sure that you feel set up and prepare to email your list consistently as you go back and set up your habits within your team or your own schedule. So, if you were curious about what's possible for your business and how I can help you get there, I would love it if you would book a discovery call with me. So, duett.co/call. There's no charge to hop on a call with me.
