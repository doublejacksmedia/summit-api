[00:00:03.650] - Rebekah Lara
Hello, and welcome to Sanity Saving Systems for Bloggers. My name is Rebekah Lara, and I'm honored to be here with you today. A little about me before we begin. I am a certified time hacker coach, the creator of the Time Freedom Simplified program, and an online business manager for one client. But most of all, and most important, I should say, is that I am a mom to three young ladies who all have multiple medical conditions and special needs. So the theme you might see here is that when it comes to having limited time, I've been there. I am there. And that's why the topic of time is so important to me. If you find yourself saying, I don't have time for, fill in the blank, then I am the person who wants to support you to create more time freedom for what matters most to you. So what can you expect today? I will be sharing strategies, advice, tips, ideas, just things that I have put into practice myself and with clients and in another person's six-figure business to help you create sanity-saving systems for your business. Plus, there will be time for you to take action and start creating your systems today.

[00:01:35.470] - Rebekah Lara
But before we begin, what is a system? This is really helpful to pause and get clear on the definition so that you know what we're talking about moving forward, because different people might use this term differently. When I speak of a system, it is a procedure that outlines how to do something in your business to achieve your goals or create a desired result. My goal and intent here is that the system not only outlines how you do something, but it also saves you mental energy and space so that you can free up your brain, declutter your brain to be more creative and strategic in your business and as a blogger. People who are writers and entrepreneurs need to have focused creative time in order to serve the clients and community best. The other thing I want you to consider are some thoughts to lean into and perhaps believe or practice believing that there is no right way to do this. Meaning there's not one singular way to create a system for you, your blog, or your business. There's only my way, meaning you, the individual, the blogger. There's only your way and the way that works best for you.

[00:03:05.280] - Rebekah Lara
If you say that back to yourself, there's only my way and the way that works best for me. And that this can be simple. What are the benefits of systems? Obviously, we want to improve organization within our business. This will help us save time. It allows for delegation of duties, whether it's now or in the future, if you bring on a virtual assistant or grow a team. You won't have to rely on your memory for how to do tasks, and this is especially helpful for things that maybe you don't do every day. It's just once a month or once a quarter. It ensures that efficiency is high and error is low, especially when we're thinking about relying on our memory or outsourcing any of these tasks in our business. And finally, it frees up your time to do more strategic work and revenue-generating tasks, and anything else that you find fun and enjoyable. The ultimate benefit is that it frees up your time for what matters most in your life. So whether that be finding the extra time in your day to blog or grow your business, or if that means being able to do those tasks that are important in your blog and business, while also being able to create quality time with your family, space and energy and time to pursue hobbies and connect with friends and extended family members.

[00:04:41.350] - Rebekah Lara
Whatever you find important. We want your business to make an impact and be successful while also freeing up your time to go live life. So what system will you create first? I have some ideas for some simple systems. This is not an all-inclusive list. It's just meant to help get your wheels turning and brainstorm where you want to begin. You do not need to do all of these at once. I will suggest a couple of times throughout this presentation that we just start with one or two, and from there, you can build upon it. So some ideas for starting are anything that you do repeatedly or recurring tasks such as content planning, creation, content posting, recording podcast episodes, It could also include emailing your community and so on. You can also think about tasks that you want to remember how to do, like I mentioned, things that you don't do all the time, every day, every week. Perhaps it could be something like how to pay your affiliates, how to edit a podcast or a video, how to run a workshop series or a webinar, like what are the steps? Another idea would be how to submit a presentation for a summit like this one, or if you're participating in a bundle, anything that might have multiple steps that the next time you go to do it, you want to remember how to do it without needing to reach teach yourself.

[00:06:16.640] - Rebekah Lara
And third, what task would you want to outsource, whether now or in the future? Even if you're not quite ready to outsource, those are some places to set up those systems first so that when you are ready, whether it be just time and energy or you're bringing in the income that will support a team member, you are ready to go and you don't need to set up that system for them to begin. So think about what you would outsource first. What is something that can be delegated? There are some things in your business that only you can do, like record the podcast episode, perhaps. But other things, like editing the podcast episode, could be delegated to a team member or even a contractor. Another question to ask is, what do you dislike doing? You don't need to keep doing those things that you don't like doing once you bring on a team member or a virtual assistant. So that is something you could set up a system for ahead of time and have it ready to go when you hire someone. And what are tasks that you don't need to do yourself, which I already mentioned.

[00:07:24.740] - Rebekah Lara
That's a big one. Those are the things we want to outsource first. So Demo time. Let's look at some simple systems that I have created and used in my business that you could perhaps gain some inspiration from, take it as a starting point to develop your own, and just get the wheels turning for what it could look like. I'm a visual learner, so I like to provide these examples so that people can picture what it would look like for them in their business, and they can take this and run with it. So the few ideas I will share with you today, again, not an all-inclusive list, just a starting point, but my first simple planning system, my Monday Map, Week at a glance, Finish it Friday, and at the end, I will be able to share with you the ultimate content bank. So my first simple planning system was just a simple notebook, like the one in this image. It was actually a bullet journal, and I just labeled the date, and I identified the top three things I wanted to do each day. This was way back, like during the pandemic, my daughter had a very critical illness and was still at home recovering and on multiple medical interventions, including a feeding tube and daily oxygen, and the list goes on, right?

[00:08:54.250] - Rebekah Lara
Plus, I had two younger children who were home during the pandemic, and they were all doing remote learning through their computers. So I needed a super simple system to keep me on track because I still wanted to start growing and building my business. And so I just had a simple notebook, a bullet journal that I didn't use like a typical bullet journal, but I just liked it because it was wide open. All I do is put the date. I made three checkboxes, and I would identify the top three things I wanted to do each day. They didn't have to be big things. They could be simple things such as publish one Instagram post, write 500 words for my blog, that post that I was working on that week, and pin two Pinterest pins. Those were the things I could sustain and manage at that time in my life. So that was my first simple system. Next, I'm going to share my screen and show you the other ideas that I have for you if you're ready to take it to a digital level.

[00:10:00.080] - Rebekah Lara
This is a screen share showing my Asana account, and this is where I choose to keep track of some of these systems. First one is the Monday Map, and this is something that I've used to help me map out my week. It is named Monday Map because I have it recur every Monday in Asana to remind me to do these things. I've created this checklist here in the subtask area where I remind myself how I'm going to schedule things. I remind myself to schedule free time first, whether that looks like exercise or hobbies or connecting with a friend or reading a book. I tried to do that first because If I wait until there's extra time, we all know how that goes. Then it just runs through the different things that I want to do. You could certainly customize this and put this in any tool that you want, whether it be Notion or Trello or a checklist checklist in Excel or Google Sheets, whatever. There's no right way to do this. It's just use the tool that is working well for you right now and create a checklist like this. This is how you remember to do those things that you want to do every week, to plan out your week in an intentional way.

[00:11:22.110] - Rebekah Lara
I have it set so that it recurs. Well, it was recurring. But in Asana, you can set it to recur on every Monday. And then you set this up once, and when you are done, you can click Complete, and it will, in a moment, repopulate here to the following Monday.

[00:11:43.690] - Rebekah Lara
There it is.

[00:11:45.910] - Rebekah Lara
Likewise, I do something similar on Fridays at the end of my work week. Again, this doesn't have to be on a Monday or Friday. It can be any day that you desire that works with your schedule. But for me, it's Fridays. So Finish it Friday. I set up, again, a recurring task on every Friday, set it to repeat so that every Friday it's going to have this template already set up, and I do different things to wrap up my week. I evaluate using these questions like what worked, what didn't work, what will I do differently? I can obviously update and change this at any time. I like to write notes about open items that popped up throughout the week or things I didn't complete. I always try to celebrate at least three things that went well. So again, there is a checklist down here at the bottom to help me remember to do all those things. I also have a space to check in with my one-to-one clients and do Voxer coaching with those clients on Fridays. And then I always try to check in with my subscriptions to see what's renewing, if I need to cancel anything or track business expenses.

[00:12:57.750] - Rebekah Lara
If I do this repeatedly every week, it starts to become a routine and it flows. I don't have to think about what I need to do at the end of the week. I have it all set up here to remind me so that I can clear up my mental space and energy for other things. The third system that I keep track of in Asana, and I've helped other clients set up, is Week at a Glance. Again, this is something you could certainly set up in a multiple different places, such as Trello, I'm sure, and Notion. You could even print a PDF version of a calendar and do it that way. But I like to group and theme my days. I try to consider my energy level, my weekly schedule with the family obligations and other things going on, and just group those like tasks or similar tasks together. That way, I can flow easier through these typical tasks, and I'm also honoring my energy. So for me, this is just one example, how I have these themes for each day. Again, it allows me to batch content, to be in the right head space to do these things without switching back and forth between wildly different tasks.

[00:14:21.800] - Rebekah Lara
Now, if that works for you, I encourage you to keep doing what you're doing. But if you want to set up a week at a glance, So that, again, you don't have to think about every Monday, what do I do? It's just like, Oh, okay, on Mondays, I'm going to do planning and training and develop some SOPs. I like my Mondays to be a little slower and not have to do client meetings. I'm coming off a weekend where I am managing the family obligations, household things. So my energy, I'm not exactly rested every weekend. So Monday is my day to move slower and build that rest into my Mondays so that on Tuesdays, I can do things for clients. I have the energy and space to do that in my schedule. So things like Coaching client meetings, email follow-ups, things like that. And then you get the idea. This is, again, just an example. You don't have to do it exactly this way. But that way, every week, I know my flow for how I'm getting work completed, and I'm grouping them into similar activities. You can notice here there's a content planning day so that you could work on blog posts or at least the editing.

[00:15:42.310] - Rebekah Lara
As a blogger, you might want to consider different days for doing rough draughts or editing or final publishing, things like that could be helpful as well.

[00:15:53.400] - Rebekah Lara
So now it's your turn. Consider this question. What system will you create first? Given the ideas shared and the demonstration, what system do you think would be most beneficial to you that you would like to start with? Start with a simple one. We don't want to overly complicate our first documented system. We want this to be an easy process for you. So I encourage you to post in the chat and let us know. Feel free to also add any questions or celebrations, things maybe you're already doing that you want to share with others. Likewise, you can always go into the summit Facebook group and post there as well. Next, decide where you want to document your systems. Start creating just a couple of systems in the beginning, right? Like I just shared, based on what you came up with in step one. Just start with one, maybe two. You can always add more for other tasks, procedures, and projects as time goes on. Consider this like a living, breathing library of procedures or policies or whatever word you want to use there that makes it easier for you to start documenting. Remember, there's no right way to do this.

[00:17:13.550] - Rebekah Lara
There's only your way and the way that works best for you. So some of the places you could document these systems are in Asana, like I shared, in Airtable, which I will show you a content bank that you can use to get started, or even in something as simple as Google Docs. Just use a tool that you are already familiar with and use in your business, and ask yourself if you can start documenting your systems in that location. Step three will be to list all your steps and plan out the system. So remember to think like a beginner when you're doing this. Include details that would help someone just getting started or who has never done this certain task or project before. So remember, the idea is to include lots of details, especially if you're going to in the future or your plan in the future is to hire a team member or virtual assistant. You want to start explaining it from step one. Ask yourself, as you're thinking about how to plan out your system, what is the easiest way I can do this? How can I make sure I maximize efficiency I simplify the process, and I optimize my time?

[00:18:33.300] - Rebekah Lara
Those are our goals. We don't want to overly complicate this. You could list out the steps, just one, two, three, or a checkbox, like you saw in some of my examples. You can also include videos or images. Those are really helpful, especially to help you jog your memory and also for future team members, so that it could replace a potential one-on-one training session. If you use something like a Loom video or Asana has native video capabilities right built in the tool, you can record your screen and share that link out or include that with the documented system in the Google Doc or in Airtable so that a new employee or even yourself, when you're going back to a task you haven't done in a while, can quickly watch that brief video and see in action how while you're doing things. Visuals are so helpful for not only the team members, but also for you. So tips for you. Document your systems as you create them. You don't need to set aside multiple days to do this. I like to encourage my clients to just do it as you go. So the next time you're editing a podcast episode, document the system.

[00:19:56.430] - Rebekah Lara
What do you do first, second, third, or at that time, record your screen. At a minimum, you could record your screen using something like Loom and at least save that link, and then maybe later go back and elaborate and come up with the steps as you finetune it. You don't need to do them all at once, right? This is a living, breathing library that is going to grow and evolve over time. You can always update. You can always add to them. So again, pause here for a moment and decide where do you want to document your systems? This shouldn't take you very long. I encourage you to use something, a tool that you're already using. The only additional tip I will give you is that doing it somewhere digital, if you plan to collaborate with a team member, a contractor, or a virtual assistant, will be very helpful, especially if they are not local to you. So once again, I encourage you to post that decision decision. We are starting to make these decisions so that you can keep taking these next steps and start creating your systems today. And that first step is making the decision.

[00:21:11.310] - Rebekah Lara
So post that here in the chat with any questions, celebrations, or head over to the Facebook group so that we can cheer you on or support you as you take this next step. And like I said, if you have any questions overall on any of these steps that I shared today to help you Create sanity-saving systems for your blogging business, post in the summit Facebook group. I will be there to help support you in the best way I can. As long as the summit is happening, I will be around. So Tag me, post there, post your celebrations, tell us what you're doing, and if you hit any challenges or roadblocks along the way, please post. And if you want to take it one step further, I am happy to provide the ultimate Content Bank for you. This is another system I've created for myself using Airtable to help me organize all of my content, whether it be blog posts, emails, social media content. You can use this ultimate content bank to go from scattered to organized using this done for you Airtable template to organize the content, batch it, repurpose your content to help save you time.

[00:22:29.140] - Rebekah Lara
So you You can click the button here on this summit page to download this free template and get started today with a quick video that will help you learn how to use this tool if you haven't yet already. It's been a pleasure and an honor to be here with you and supporting you to help you create sanity-saving systems. My goal is that you are able to create time, space, and energy for what matters most to you. And if I can help you in any other way, please head over to the Facebook group me know. Wishing you all the best with your simple system creation.
