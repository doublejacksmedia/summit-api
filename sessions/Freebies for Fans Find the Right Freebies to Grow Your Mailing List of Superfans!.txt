[00:00:09.400] - Liz Stapleton, Summit Host
All right, guys, I'm really excited for this session, we're here with Jennifer Maker, who I've been following, I think almost as long as I've been blogging definitely multiple years now. Jennifer, thank you so much for being here. I really appreciate it.

[00:00:21.760] - Jennifer Maker, jennifermaker.com
I'm super excited to do this with you, Liz. Thank you for inviting me to do this. 

[00:00:26.380] - Liz
Yes. In case anyone doesn't know you, can you just tell them a little bit about your background?

[00:00:32.630] - Jennifer
Yes, so my name is Jennifer and I run a craft blog, a DIY and craft blog called jennifermaker.com, and I started it just over four years ago because I was completely broke and needed something to do to figure out, to get myself out of my my hole of debt, basically. And I now it is it's gone really, really well. And these past four plus years and we get between five to seven million sessions per year.

[00:01:02.960] - Jennifer
And I have over a million subscribers, my mailing list and half a million subscribers on YouTube and all sorts of amazing things. I have a team now of 23 people and it's so amazing and awesome and cool and I love what I do. 

[00:01:21.170] - Liz
Yes.  So and you're great at what you do. I'm not going to lie, I've definitely. Watched some of your Cricut tutorials as I've learned a few Cricut tricks

[00:01:29.940] - Jennifer
You have a Cricut?

[00:01:30.920] - Liz
My sister does and I just buy my own vinyl and then she lets me use it.

[00:01:36.590] - Jennifer
That's cool.

[00:01:37.390] - Liz
Yeah, but obviously like a million email subscribers, like that is insane to think about how many that is. So we're here to talk about basically getting email subscribers, growing your list with the right offer or freebie.

[00:01:52.910] - Liz
How kind of might my first question I guess is how do you decide the format of your freebie?

[00:01:59.870] - Jennifer
So that depends entirely on your audience and your topic. And it took me, I would say, five months until I hit upon a freebie that my audience, my intended audience didn't really have one in the beginning. After all, none of us do in the beginning, the one that they really, really wanted, which in my case was essentially patterns for the crafts that I made. And once I figured that out and I realized how much they liked it, I just kept rinse  and repeating.

[00:02:28.160] - Jennifer
But that's not true of every niche and every topic. Even in my own topic of DIY and crafts, I have other freebies that I use other times. So what I do is I look at whatever it is I'm talking about and I think, "What do people really need to take the next step to implement whatever it is I'm teaching?" And it could be lots of things. If it's a project, then of course, having the pattern is super, super helpful.

[00:02:53.720] - Jennifer
But if it's a technique, then there's no pattern for that. It doesn't work the same way. So it could be a worksheet or a really short ebook or it could be like a mini course. So. Or an email challenge, right, there's so many different things that you could do. So I really just asked myself what what would they what would help them make this thing happen for them, whatever it is that they landed upon my blog in the first place for.

[00:03:20.640] - Jennifer
Right. So that's what I do. I just ask the question.

[00:03:24.620] - Liz
Sure.

[00:03:25.310] - Liz
And for yours, where it's really project specific, you probably do create a lot more freebies in terms of, like, for you.

[00:03:36.480] - Jennifer
Right.

[00:03:36.920] - Jennifer
So some people can get away with one killer freebie. That is basically their main topic. And they put that on all of their blog posts or their offers or whatever it is that they're doing. This is not limited to blog blogging at all. But in my case, what I discovered is that they really like patterns which are not difficult to create.

[00:03:57.080] - Jennifer
So I could just make a lot of patterns. So at this point, I have two hundred and seventy five of these patterns that I give away for free in their idea lead magnets for that, like, segment of what I do is that the only lead magnet I have. But it works really well. And if it works well, why wouldn't I just keep doing that?

[00:04:16.220] - Liz
Exactly.

[00:04:16.220] - Jennifer
So I do.

[00:04:17.830] - Liz
I don't want people being, "Oh my God, I have to go back and create freebie for every single post." Like, not necessarily, you know, do that at all.

[00:04:25.100] - Jennifer
No, really. You can have one killer freebie that does a great job for you. I just find that I mean and I have some freebies that I'll put on a lot of posts, like I have many courses and challenge that will go on a number of different posts. But for me and my niche, a pattern is like the best one to get people because they can't do the thing without the patterns.

[00:04:46.460] - Jennifer
So it's like a no brainer. They want that. Right. So yeah, I'm sure that I am at the far end of having, if there is a spectrum of how many freebies you have from one to like, I don't know, I'm at that far end with two hundred seventy I'm sure.

[00:05:02.840] - Liz
Yeah, but there was like a few years ago...The thing was they were called content upgrades and every single post you created a content upgrade. But I think it's really if you have like a graphic that makes sense. But otherwise, like one per category is probably...

[00:05:17.330] - Jennifer
Exactly one per category is a great way to do it.

[00:05:19.820] - Jennifer
Like, I kind of separate my content into ladder's. So I call them product ladders. Right. It sounds like really boring and everything, but like so there's my cricket product ladder and there's my sewing one. And I talk about blogging. So I have blogging and we're adding things as we go to. So if I were not in crafting, I would have freebies for those things and the freebies would eventually lead into the paid products. And, you know, you would lead your reader right through the whole thing.

[00:05:50.300] - Jennifer
So, yeah.

[00:05:52.400] - Liz
Yeah, I think I first heard that term when one of Russell Brunson's books or something like that,

[00:05:57.090] - Jennifer
I have no idea where I heard it from.

[00:05:58.730] - Jennifer
It's so funny how terms kind of, they just kind of sink into the community and so on will say it, you pick it up and then like a year later you realize that it was someone wrote a whole book about it.

[00:06:08.888] - Liz
Yeah. 

[00:06:08.960] - Jennifer
But you had no idea. That happens to me a lot. 

[00:06:12.710] - Liz
Yes. OK, so I want to touch on a couple of things you said. You said it took you five months to figure out what really worked so, what were you doing in those five months to figure it out?

[00:06:23.120] - Jennifer
I was, I had no freebies the first three months at all. I had no mailing list for the first three months because when I started my blog, I'm like, I do not want a mailing list that is like super nineties. Everyone hates email, especially me, and I'm not even going to go down that road. But of course, that's not reality. And I think I discovered that like somewhere like in the middle of my third month. And then, of course, I had to have a reason for them to want to join my mailing list, because I used to have, I had a business before this and I just had like a banner up on the page that said, "Hey, if you want my latest updates and whatever," and some people joined, but not very many.

[00:06:59.150] - Jennifer
And I can tell because I was comparing myself with other people in my niche, which was Disney travel, and because they would tell that every once in a while they'd say, I have 150,000 subscribers and I only had 50,000. And I'm like, well, what am I doing wrong? So what, I started my blog and I decided to start a mailing list. I knew that that alone just saying, do you want to join my mailing list would not be enough because of my past failure at it.

[00:07:26.480] - Jennifer
And so I decided, I actually, I got, I stumbled upon this by accident. I had a party planning thing for Minecraft up on my blog. And I had just put it up there and said, here's the PDF. You can download it if you want. And a lot of people were downloading it. So I decided to say, you can join my mailing list and in return I will give you access to my resource library that has this in it.

[00:07:55.850] - Jennifer
And it was like an overnight thing. And then they're like, "Yes, of course we'll do that. We want your stuff." So it was it was kind of an accident.

[00:08:05.120] - Liz
Yeah.

[00:08:05.420] - Jennifer
A happy accident, then. I realized that I work for growing a mailing list and then so I tried a couple of things after, after I started the list, which was around month four and they were fails for the most part. They were like, "Jere's 5 Tips on..." This thing, or "Here's how to make a messy Bandini hat."

[00:08:26.580] - Jennifer
And they didn't care at all. And then I bought a Cricut and, just for fun, it was going to be part of my blog post. And I made a file for it, like, right away because I've been a graphic designer for, like since the late 80s and I thought I should offer it to the people on my blog post, on my blog, because this is related to crafting, right? I didn't really, it wasn't an intentional thing, but I did it and I shared it in a Facebook group that I was in.

[00:08:55.450] - Jennifer
And I put it on to an option and they went crazy for it. And that's how I discovered that this was something that would work for my niche. So I just like threw spaghetti at the wall and something stuck.

[00:09:09.880] - Liz
Yeah.

[00:09:10.210] - Liz
And don't be afraid to do that and fail. You can always take it down.

[00:09:14.170] - Jennifer
 Oh my goodness, I fail so much. People have no idea how often I fail. What my fiancée says is that I fail up, so I just try to feel better and better each time until eventually other people call it a success, even if I'm not really like it's working, right?

[00:09:31.160] - Jennifer
Yeah. Eventually I'm like, OK, that's good enough.

[00:09:33.400] - Jennifer
That's a success to me.

[00:09:34.720] - Liz
Yes. Yes.

[00:09:36.500] - Jennifer
However, in fact, you can't be afraid to fail. You need to embrace failure. You need to make mistakes that you're going to like. You know, you're going to just totally burn and it's going to be horrible and you feel bad. But the next day you're going to get up and you're going to try again and you're going to get a little further that next time. 

[00:09:55.210] - Liz
Yeah. You learn so much more from failures than you do...

[00:09:57.670] - Jennifer
Absolutely.

[00:09:58.310] - Liz
Waiting, waiting, researching. Researching.

[00:10:00.290] - Jennifer
Oh, yeah. Yeah. Don't do that.

[00:10:02.650] - Liz
Yeah. Yeah

[00:10:03.460] - Jennifer
You've got to go there and try it.

[00:10:05.140] - Liz
OK, so you know, because we do, we've all had freebies flop. What do you do with them. Do you kind of stow them away and then sometimes, years later, they make themselves useful again? Do you take down the opt-in on your site?

[00:10:21.490] - Liz
What do you what do you do? You know there's probably a welcome sequence attached. It just it gets very busy real fast

[00:10:28.010] - Jennifer
Well, so, what I do is I keep most of my freebies in like a resource library that's because I have so many of them. So it's so much easier for me just to upload that file into that library and then people can go there to download it. Not all, but almost all are there. So if it doesn't do well, I do nothing.

[00:10:45.900] - Jennifer
I just move on to the next project. I don't spend any more time on it at all. I've only ever had one freebie that I, like, took down and it was a creativity challenge. And the only reason I took it down was because I was lazy and simply recycled everything and turned it into my craft room organization challenge with it, which was a success. So otherwise I would have done nothing with it. I would have just left it there. That was the email challenge.

[00:11:11.940] - Liz
Ok, gotcha.

[00:11:12.480] - Liz
OK, and then how, you know, you say that you obviously you can create your freebies very quickly. Well, some more quickly than others. Another e-mail challenge is going to take you a lot longer to create than a template, I would assume. How long do you think it's too long to spend on a freebie?

[00:11:34.320] - Jennifer
I don't think that question is so easy to answer because it depends on, like, the way you're going to use it. So if this is just a pattern, so that would be my lowest level of freebie, I personally wouldn't spend more than three to four hours on it.

[00:11:53.210] - Liz
OK

[00:11:53.820] - Jennifer
So that's probably the minimum I'll ever spend on something, which maybe seems like a lot to a lot of people, but I don't know. I work a lot and I love to work, so I'm not afraid of work at all.

[00:12:05.670] - Jennifer
And I really like I'm really big into doing a good job. It's very important to deliver a good product. But then I, on the farther end I have, like some, like, small e-books and oh well, actually I have a new opt-In that took a lot longer to make. I created a mini course that that was three videos. Each of the videos is one hour long, but it took me three full days to make them. And we're still editing the videos now.

[00:12:32.190] - Jennifer
I did that just a couple of weeks ago, so I would say that project, which probably took me a week to work to do, but it's a very important opt-in, it's the start of a funnel for our audience after they find us through a project, it teaches them how to use their cricket cutting machine. So it's really important that I do a great job on this because in a way, it's like advertising for how I'm able to teach them through a paid course.

[00:13:03.370] - Jennifer
So I don't want to go cheap on that and I want to do a really good job on that.

[00:13:07.990] - Jennifer
And so that's more involved, but I'll be able to use that for years.

[00:13:12.580] - Liz
Yeah.

[00:13:13.360] - Jennifer
Right. So it's OK.

[00:13:15.160] - Liz
Yes.

[00:13:15.730] - Liz
And with your templates, you probably have like a system in place of how you do it, which speed things along to...

[00:13:23.380] - Jennifer
I do. I do. I have processes in place for nearly everything, unless it's something that I've never done before, in which case, I just wing it. I figure it out as I go.

[00:13:30.610] - Liz
Story of my life.

[00:13:30.690] - Jennifer
Don't we all.

[00:13:30.740] - Liz
Yes, Yes. My VA  asked me a question. I was like, "I haven't figured that out yet. Don't you know, I'm just winging this." But yeah. So do you have any advice for developing those, like systems and processes when it comes to creating previews and getting them set up?

[00:13:54.670] - Jennifer
Well, so I wouldn't say I'm good at this because for the longest, like for, so I've been, I've had a blog for a little over four years now.

[00:14:04.090] - Jennifer
Half the time it was just me.  I didn't need to really have a process, something that will be written down. It was all in here. Right? So I just did it. And I'm a very fast worker, so I would just like blaze through it and it be done. And then when I started adding team members and creating and having other people help me, then of course I came upon a problem, which is they're not me to do this.

[00:14:27.880] - Jennifer
So we have been developing the process for other people to do this this whole time that we've been doing it. I think that, but everyone works differently. Some people love to have like a checklist. So, for example, every December, I do what I call upon templates where I have a new project, which means a new design and a new video every day for 25 days, the first 25 days of December, because that's what my audience is most active online.

[00:14:54.550] - Jennifer
So it's a way to get new people to me. And that's a lot of work to go from concept to edit video all in 24 hours.  Which I did do the year before last and the year before that. This year I had help, but so I had this long checklist of things and I would just make a checklist as I went along, adding things so that I could always just follow my checklist. So I think that would be the way to start is if you you start finding yourself making freebies that are similar is to create your checklist and then it helps you know what to take.

[00:15:30.850] - Jennifer
Really, it helps, you know, what not to forget to do, like hooking it up to your ESP, your Email Service Provider, so that it actually delivers to someone or putting it into your library or whatever it is you're going to do with delivery. Right? You don't want to go to all the work and then not actually get it out to people. Right? But yeah, a checklist is a great place to start.

[00:15:51.790] - Liz
OK, and do you, you know  you mentioned email service provider. Is that sort of the ideal way to deliver a freebie or do you do it on the Thank You page after they sign up? Is there an ideal way to deliver?

[00:16:04.240] - Jennifer
I don't think that there is. I think it completely depends on your topic and audience like before. So because I do it all the different ways.  When I, for just my patterns, I put them all into my library and they get the password to it when they join my mailing list as a perk. Right? So that's the main way I do it. But when I was making face masks at the start of the pandemic last year, that was a different audience that was looking for those.

[00:16:31.090] - Jennifer
They didn't want to go to my library and search two files. They wanted their file and they wanted to move on and make it. So I delivered it to them on the Thank You page and then also sent them an email with the link to it so they could download it right from the email. So they don't even have to come back to my blog because the intent there was different than it would be for a pattern. I just needed people to get the information and go on their way and if they kept liking my content, they would stay.

[00:16:58.240] - Jennifer
And if they didn't, they would go, yeah, that was that was what I wanted. There are times when you don't want to hold on to everybody who joins or comes into your orbit, because if they're really not interested in your content or it's a one off thing, you should, you should, you should let them go.

[00:17:13.120] - Liz
Yes. Yeah. Right back at the beginning of the beginning of our talk, you mentioned, you know, getting your intended audience. Right? And so the facemask people may not have been your intended audience. A lot of people were crafting facemasks that aren't crafty in general.

[00:17:34.030] - Jennifer
Because their work sources for them back in April, right?

[00:17:37.150] - Jennifer
Yeah. And so some of those people I would say they would be, if I were to guess, I'd say 15%-20% of those people have stayed with me and are totally interested in what I do. People, they were crafting or sewing or something, and the others have just gone off, which is good because I would have like two million subscribers instead of a million right now. And that's very expensive. But it's one thing a lot of people don't think about.

[00:18:01.650] - Jennifer
But my bill for email is over $4,000 a month. Now I get the money back, like, bajillion fold, not complaining. But you don't want to have a huge list just for the sake of saying, "Look at me, I have a giant list." If they're not your people, it's just a waste of your time and money.

[00:18:19.830] - Liz
 Yeah, you're not going to earn that money back.

[00:18:21.960] - Jennifer
Exactly.

[00:18:22.660] - Jennifer
Yeah. So that's, I think, that, and as I as my list grows, it's becoming more and more important that those people who aren't my people are encouraged to leave. So I encourage that often, actually. It sounds kind of heartless, but of course, if they want to stay, they can stay.

[00:18:40.850] - Liz
Yeah, but I think that even if you find a freebie that works, if it's not attracting your intended audience, then it's not really working for you.

[00:18:49.260] - Jennifer
Exactly. For example, you could hear me talking about making patterns and you could go over on to your blog and you can make this awesome pattern that, you know, people love. But if that's not the thing that you do on your blog and that's not the people that you, it's not like your direction. It's just like a thing that you could have done. It's not going to do you any good to have those people who got that pattern because you're not, you can't serve them with what you normally do.

[00:19:13.500] - Jennifer
And they're not going to be interested in the other things that you do. It just doesn't work that way. So focus is really a big deal, I think. Focusing on your audience and what they need and not being all over the map.

[00:19:27.630] - Liz
Yeah, I mean, even if you're sort of throwing spaghetti at the wall when you're evaluating it.  Realize, but, ok, is this attracting the right people?

[00:19:35.500] - Jennifer
Exactly. Right.

[00:19:37.020] - Liz
Because like that...

[00:19:38.400] - Jennifer
That party principle I mentioned for Minecraft, I no longer talk about kids parties. I don't talk about Minecraft, although I love that game. I don't do it. It's that part of what I do. So I no longer have an opt-in for that. I just give it to him. I'm like, here it is. You download it if you want.

[00:19:54.450] - Liz
Yeah. You don't have to make the audience anymore.

[00:19:57.840] - Jennifer
They can have it.

[00:19:58.790] - Liz
Yeah. Yeah, that's easy enough to just to give them a link. You don't have to make them signup for your email.

[00:20:03.960] - Jennifer
That's right.

[00:20:04.380] - Jennifer
You don't have to make them sign up for anything if you don't want. Yeah.

[00:20:07.500] - Liz
Yes. I think a lot of people don't think about that. OK, let me just kind of review my notes to see if there's anything I wanted to touch on. Again, I think you answered all my questions. I think that was it. I know you have something free for all of our attendees, an ebook of some sort?

[00:20:26.640] - Jennifer
Yeah. So I have a book on list building that talks about freebies and how you can use them. It like, lists, like, the different types of freebies, because I know, like, a lot of people when they hear me talk are like, I don't have patterns, I don't do crafts. And it's difficult to understand how this could relate to you. Right? But you, freebies can vary so much. They can be a coupon. They can be a library of resources, they can be an event.

[00:20:54.300] - Jennifer
It can be a Facebook group. There's actually so many different...

[00:20:57.660] - Liz
It can be a video. It can be a checklist.

[00:21:00.420] - Jennifer
Exactly. There's so many. A contest is another one, so long as it's really relevant to your topic, not just some, I'm going to give away an iPhone or something, but that's unless your blog is about iPhone, then that would be fine. But yeah. So the it's an e-book and I think I call this love introduction to list building.

[00:21:18.450] - Jennifer
That's the neighborhood. And it's a really good overview of how I came about to figure out how to do this and then how I implement it and the steps I take to implement it and make it work. And I've been doing the same thing this whole time. It's work. It works like gangbusters. I have to say, I just you just got to find the right freebie for your audience and then you either make that freebie more appealing and you just offer it to more people or you just make more freebies like it.

[00:21:45.510] - Jennifer
That's kind of how I. I see it.

[00:21:48.640] - Liz
Yeah, and I, I kind of want to add or say that stick with it. Right, because so many people get nowhere because they do shiny object syndrome. And so even though they found something that worked, they moved away from it. Actually I totally have been guilty of this, by the way. I'm not judging. You know, they moved away from it and then they're like, well, how come I'm not at fifty thousand subscribers or something?

[00:22:10.990] - Liz
And it's because you got too excited about something else instead of really focusing and growing that one thing that's working.

[00:22:16.750] - Jennifer
I couldn't agree more. I think that one of the reasons that I am successful is because I'm one of the most tenacious people I know. I am very stubborn and I don't give up easily. That's not always a good thing, by the way. But in this case, it actually really helps a lot that I will stick with something and try all the things I can think of until eventually, you know some things don't work. But I will like the blogging, my blogging as a whole.  I just stuck with it until I got to work and I just kept thinking push that square peg into the round hole until it just wasn't square anymore and it fit.

[00:22:52.640] - Liz
Yeah.

[00:22:54.370] - Jennifer
So not giving up is huge. Like seriously it's so huge.

[00:23:00.280] - Liz
Yeah. Ok.

And then the last thing on to touch on is you actually very kindly contributed something to our Pro-Pass. So for those that have the Pro-Pass, or thinking about getting the Pro-Pass, you should totally get it, because you're getting from Jennifer a really amazing course, if you would tell them about this.

[00:23:19.780] - Jennifer
Yes, it's my List Love Quick Start Course. So List Love is my method of doing what I do for getting email subscribers and I'm nurturing them and creating a relationship with people. So  let's get you all set up to do it.

And it's a video course. So it's like a regular full course. And I think it's awesome. I've been doing it for like three years and people have found a lot of success doing this. So it works.  You should try it.

[00:23:50.020] - Liz
Yes. So definitely grab your pro-pass and so you can get inside of that. Jennifer, again, thank you so much for being here. Any final words before we sign off?

[00:24:00.100] - Jennifer
I think that my mailing list is one of the biggest reasons why I am a seven figure, almost eight figure blogger. And if you think about all those zeros, that's way more than I ever thought was possible to do with blogging. The mailing list is the key to it. It was, that was the key to unlocking the revenue. Therefore, I really think it's very important that you make a mailing list no matter what you hear out there.

[00:24:28.180] - Jennifer
Whatever anyone says, take it. Trust me, I know what I'm saying here. Make the mailing list your priority. I make everything final to my mailing list. So my goal is always to get people onto my mailing list, not to grow my social media, not to get a bunch of likes, I don't know, or something. It's always to get them onto my mailing list. So if you make it a priority, it works.

[00:24:52.640] - Jennifer
That's my advice.

[00:24:53.710] - Liz
Yes.

[00:24:54.400] - Liz
So make it a priority. We have lots of sessions to help you earn money from your list once you have it or earn it as they join that sort of thing. Again, thank you so much. And guys, we'll catch up the next session.

[00:25:07.510] - Jennifer
Thank you.
