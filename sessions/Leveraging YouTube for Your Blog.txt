All right, guys, I'm really excited with the session with Breonna Queen, who is a video strategist and YouTuber. Breonna, thank you so much for joining us. I really appreciate you taking the time.

[00:00:20.740] - Breonna Queen, www.breonnaqueen.com
Thank you for having me.

[00:00:22.840] - Liz
In case anyone doesn't know you, you want to give them just a little bit on your b background and how you got to where you are.

[00:00:29.340] - Breonna
Yes, again, my name is Breonna Queen, I am in video strategist as well as a YouTuber, content creator. I started off just helping other businesses grow their online presence and I had a business reach out to me and say, "Hey, you want to be on YouTube?" So I started a YouTube channel just to help my client and my YouTube channel actually end up like I guess booming. And today I have over 85,000 subscribers, over three million views. I've been featured in like Own as well as HBO and Bus, all those great things. So, I really focus on like DIY type of videos like YouTube so I can really help you grow your visibility as well as your impact.

[00:01:08.730] - Liz
 Yeah, because I feel like a lot of people don't realize that YouTube is its own search engine.

[00:01:12.890] - Breonna
Yes.

[00:01:13.470] - Liz
So, there's a lot of opportunity for growth. So, if you're going to be creating content for our blog, why not use YouTube to help leverage your blog and everything? Okay, so when it comes to- how can YouTube really help your blog? I mean, we touched on it a little bit. It's a- it's a search engine. But how can you really kind of connect those two?

[00:01:33.040] - Breonna
So, I love adding YouTube videos to my blog post for Run, it's great for SEO. Now YouTube loves- not even YouTube Google because Google owns YouTube- Google loves, loves, loves videos and have a blog post and you have a video, you're more likely to rank higher than your competitor, who might also have a blog post the the same exact link as yours. Another great thing is it gives you double visibility because Google is the first biggest search engine and then YouTube second. So, if someone is typing out the best chicken noodle soup ever, they might discover your blog. They may discover your YouTube channel. When you combine those both together you get even more chance of somebody actually discovering you. So, I love adding my YouTube videos to my blog post. And then in the same breath, I love adding my blog post to my YouTube videos. So, I'll say on my YouTube video check out the blog post and I'll say in the blog post, check out the YouTube video, because people like to learn differently. So people like to learn like visual as in seeing and some like to learn visually as in reading. So, why not give the people both?

[00:02:35.290] - Liz
Yes, more opportunities. Okay, so what are- because YouTube is just like blogging is it's a learning curve. YouTube's kind of its own learning curve, too. What are some sort of like settings or things you can do to kind of set yourself up, right? I guess.

[00:02:52.750] - Breonna
So, when you're first starting your YouTube channel, I always tell people do not focus on subscribers like that is a vanity metric. Do not focus on that. Focus on really one becoming comfortable on camera. And just like you need a niche when you're blogging, you need a niche for your YouTube channel to. So, if you're really going to be leveraging YouTube for your blog, obviously you want to have the same exact niche. But really think about how can you put yourself out there in front of your audience so that you can really connect with them because blogging is all about building a community and so is having a YouTube channel.

[00:03:23.440] - Breonna
So I always tell people,  think about how can impact people via video, like with your blog post and really just build a community.

[00:03:33.040] - Liz
OK, so when you're and I kind of want to talk about the technical aspect of YouTube a little bit, because I think if you don't know what you're doing is a little confusing. I know like the first time I started publishing YouTube videos, I didn't know I could schedule them, so... So what are some things you need to pay attention to when you're getting ready to publish a video sort of just on the back end to make sure it does? Well, what are some things you can do?

[00:03:57.680] - Breonna
So the most important thing is your thumbnail. Your thumbnail is that picture that shows up when someone is searching. Are they going through their YouTube homepage? The thumbnail is so important. I find the best thumbnails are ones that feature your face. So you really want to focus on really great attention grabbing thumbnails where people are going to, like, stop scroll and say, "Oh, I'm going to click on this video right here." That's the one thing you will do. Second thing that's really important is your title, just like a title is super important for your blog post. Same thing for your YouTube video. So you want to have a YouTube title that's one going to let Google and YouTube know what the video's about, as well as let people know what it's about if they want to click on it. So, for example, you can have a title tag and it's called a time tag, just like blogging and you can have a title tag in. It is How to Make Chicken Noodle Soup. But in the title tag is the best chicken soup in the world. That one makes you want to be like, "Oh, is the best chicken noodle soup in the world. Let me click it." And it also lets YouTube know this is about chicken noodle soup. So, really think about how can you create title tags that make you want to click on it as well as like Google AdWords like what know  the video is about.  And the third thing is your description. The same way with a blog post you can have that content. Same with the YouTube channel. That little description like your name and what the video is about, it's basically another way to optimize your videos. So, focus on that as well. So, focus on the thumbnail up the title as well as a description. Inside of description just you  again want to again add what the video is about and how your audience can connect better with you because you create this amazing video. People like, "Oh my gosh, she's amazing." And they click on a description- give them something to do. Say, "Hey, follow my Instagram or follow my blog post." Give them a CTA in the video as well as inside a description.

[00:05:45.850] - Liz
And correct me if I'm wrong, but you can actually do like a default description, which you can use sort of as your outline to help make you remember all the things you need to include.

[00:05:53.590] - Breonna
Yes, you can.

[00:05:55.460] - Liz
Okay, I learned that last year from one of our YouTube sessions. Okay. So- and then the other thing I want to ask you about sort of on the back end, is there tags you can- how important are tags that you add or don't add or...?

[00:06:09.100] - Breonna
YouTube came out this year and they the tags are not that important. I think they still are. I'm currently testing it out; but this year YouTube said the tags are not as- they don't help with brand. That's what you need to know this year. So, that's why I really focusing on that title tag as well as that description if YouTube is prioritizing title tags- well tags this year.

[00:06:30.030] - Liz
Okay, got you. I just want to ask about that. Okay, and then once you've got the video, you've got your description, your awesome channel- the video art thumbnail. I can think of words I'm sure. What do you need to do after you hit publish to try to make it successful?

[00:06:48.250] - Breonna
So you want to promote your video on the platform as well as off the platform. So, the same with blogging, you tend to like- I know with me whenever I create a blog post, I always put on Pinterest like that is like you have to put a pin out. You don't need to. Create your YouTube video and and create pins on Pinterest for your YouTube video, post it on social media, like Facebook, like Instagram, like your blog. So, not an email. I think I may be wrong, but I'm pretty sure it's like sixty percent like that's the- people are more likely to click on an email if video is in the title. So, how many email that says, you know, I have a new video, especially if you don't create videos. If you do not create videos, and you let your email list know like, "Hey, guys, I'm doing a video now." I guarantee you're going to get some new clicks. So, like, really just promoted the same with your blog post from on your social media. And then on the platform, you want to obviously do the title tag and description. And then if you know people who are on YouTube, send a message, or send them a comment saying, "Hey, I love this video." Don't spam." Actually watch the video, say, "Hey, I love your video." I also created a video similar to this. Let me know what you think. So, just really just promote it any way you can the same with the blog post, but don't spammy. I always want to say that, don't be spammy.

[00:08:02.320] - Liz
Always be authentic and genuine; like you're going to get so much further away. People can tell when you're spam. Okay, so YouTube, if you're just getting started, you can't monetize YouTube the way you can a blog. I mean, you're not going to get a lot of money because not a lot of traffic. Right. But so- do you have any tips on sort of getting to the point where you can monetize and is there any instance where you wouldn't want to kind of turn on that monetization channel on YouTube?

[00:08:32.380] - Breonna
Right. So, I actually have like a program that's called, like YouTube coins. And it's literally how to make money on YouTube if you have a small channel, if you're not monetized. Because as someone who is monetized, I honestly do not make majority of my money with that. Majority of my money comes from digital products and digital services. So, you can have a brand-new spanking channel. If you have 10 subscribers, on a YouTube channel and you have a course that's a thousand dollars. In fact, people buy that that's $5000 dollars from 10 people on your list. So, I would say the best way to make money with YouTube, if you have a new channel, or a small channel is really just selling your services or products. If you want to be monetized. I know it was like a thousand people and 4000 watch time; they always change it. But you can't- you can't make that a goal. But I want to say, as someone who has ad revenue, it's not that much. You make a lot more money promoting your service or product...

[00:09:31.590] - Liz
It's like a bonus.

[00:09:33.420] - Breonna
Yes, and the thing is, you can't really control how much money you make with ads, because when covid hit a lot of- a lot of super CPMs, you drop. So you may have made $20 CPM. And then when that happened, you're now making like $5 CPM. So, also take effect that you don't have any control over that but your digital products and services. You don't have to drop the amount of money that you charge for that. So, I do want to also throw it out there that yes, you can make money with AdSense, if that's something you want to do. But again, maybe as a bonus focus on selling your products or services.

[00:10:05.910] - Liz
Okay, what about affiliate marketing with YouTube?

[00:10:10.310] - Breonna
Amazing, just like with the blogs. So, I think affiliate income is great if you are doing any type of educational or lifestyle. So, if you're doing cooking, then the best way to win money may be, oh, about this amazing- let's pretend this is a baking powder. Oh this baking powder is organic and then providing that down below and then also not interviews but reviews are a great way to make money with affiliate marketing as well. And that is where I find having a blog comes in handy, because if you're doing a blog post, that's all about reviewing a type of mascara, having a video where you go really in-depth and obviously, like, give people even more like initiatives to actually buy and click the link.

[00:10:55.910] - Liz
Yeah, no, because I know when I, when I search for like a review, I'll, I'll look at video and I'm like, yeah, let me see them actually walk through it. So, it's a matter of thinking about how you use YouTube as well. I think a lot of people lose sight of how. You know, just because as content creators, we use things differently, like we really do, we forget that people do things that we're like, "Why would they do that?" And they're like, "Oh, because they're not in this, you know? So, remembering that, Okay. Do you have any sort of like systems or sort of you always use a template? Do you have anything that helps kind of speed up the time YouTube can take because any type of content creation takes that quality takes time?

[00:11:40.780] - Breonna
Yeah. So, I only took a day and I record all of my content for the month. So, I take the day and I focus in my program. We record four videos in one day so we change our outfit for each video and that's it. And then I will edit the videos or have my editor edit the videos and then from there I'll have her take out little clips of the video and those are social media posts. Then also adding video to Ajay TV and adding that video to Facebook and add a little clip to Pinterest. So the great thing about YouTube is that you really can repurpose your content. And I also have a podcast, and my podcast is literally just the YouTube video and it's just the audio. So, you can take- and then you can also get it transcribed. So, you can pay rev.com and have them transcribe that YouTube video and then as a blog post. And, you know, just formatting it to where it reads like a blog post. Taking a video you can literally make it so many different pieces of content just from one video. So, it doesn't mean that- it does not take me that long to actually create content for my YouTube channel. In one day I throw out four videos, have those edited and then turn into a Podcast episode, turning to email, turn into Instagram post, Ajay TV post, and then make it into a blog post by transcribing it.

[00:12:59.400] - Liz
Okay. I do want to ask a different question. You said you pull out clips? Do you ever post the full video like on Instagram TV or Facebook or whatnot?

[00:13:07.890] - Breonna
Absolutely, because I don't focus on ad revenue and if you was trying to get paid through YouTube ads, then you probably would not vote for me. My main objective was making money through my services and products and affiliate marketing. So I absolutely add my entire video to Ajay TV and to Facebook. Because while I love YouTube  it's not our responsibility to build up other platforms.

[00:13:30.600] - Liz
Yes.

[00:13:30.730] - Breonna
If someone's on Ajay TV, they don't want to go to your- go to YouTube and watch the video. Just give it to them there. So, I definitely put my YouTube videos on all the other platforms and people actually watch it.

[00:13:40.720] - Liz
Yeah. Okay. I'm so terrible Instagram- it's really bad. So- so when you're uploading to Instagram TV, like, are you putting in like the YouTube link and it pulls from there or are you uploading the full video?

[00:13:55.580] - Breonna
I upload the full video. So, Facebook has Facebook creative space. You can Google that. I take thirty minutes and I take my YouTube videos, my schedule them for Ajay TV because the great- thank you. Instagram and Facebook- then you can actually schedule your videos. So, just like you can schedule your videos for YouTube. So, when I schedule my videos on YouTube, I'll schedule the same exact videos to my Ajay TV and then have a post on there as well as Facebook.

[00:14:20.670] - Liz
Okay, no, that makes sense. I was just curious because I know when you're doing like text content, you don't want to post the full thing because it messes with SEO. But video is different. And so I just want to clarify that. Okay, awesome. Make sure I've got sorry, I look at my notes, I take notes, I'm such a nerd. Okay, so you do schedule, do you as a one video a week, is it when you're growing, do you want to do more than that?

[00:14:48.600] - Breonna
Like, how do you decide what your publishing calendar is going to look like? I think it's your goal. If your goal is you're like, I want to have a 100,000 subscribers by the end of this year and I want to be a pro for you to do three videos and three videos a week like that's going to get you there faster. But for me, I do one a week, I don't have all this time dedicated to creating all these videos every single week.

[00:15:13.340] - Liz
Yeah.

[00:15:13.720] - Breonna
So, it all depends on your goals. If you just want to start a YouTube channel and you want to grow it into a community. You don't have to rush, especially if you're new. It's going to be really overwhelming. But I say at least do one a week. Try one a week, if not do twice, twice a month. I think that works when you're just getting started. Really Strafford one a week. And it has to be very high quality because when you're just creating videos, I got to do three videos out a week, you start to produce fluff and it doesn't really help. People are going to go "Ew! Yuk!" They're going to close out of it and they're not going to do anything with you. So, really, at least one week in it being high quality.

[00:15:48.510] - Liz
Does it need to be a certain length, like how long the video needs to be? Like you don't want fluff.

[00:15:54.120] - Breonna
Right. No. I think whatever- however long it takes you to to produce great- a great video, do it. If it takes you five minutes to talk about the benefit of this bottle, then, so be it. If it takes 20 minutes, then so be it. I always say it doesn't matter how long the video is, as long as you provide high quality content within the video.

[00:16:18.870] - Liz
Okay. Then when you're scheduling them out, is there a certain time of day that it's better to publish or does  that matter?

[00:16:26.440] - Breonna
It depends on your audience, like if your audience is entrepreneurs then you probably want to post two o'clock in the afternoon when they have the time where our mothers. If your target market is work, mothers who work there they're probably not going to watch your video at one o'clock in the afternoon, they're probably working. So, I think it depends on your audience. Think about what time will my audience be able to watch this video. If my audience is business owners and they may have the 11:00 a.m. time to watch it? If my audience is work, know professional mothers who have a corporate job at 1:00 p.m., it's not going to work for them. So, it really depends on your audience.

[00:17:02.260] - Liz
Okay. All right. Let me see if I have any other questions I really want to dive into. Is there is there anything we haven't covered that you're like people need to know this?

[00:17:14.800] - Breonna
Two things I want to call out. You do not need a fancy camera at the start. Most of us have a camera- a phone that has great quality, audio as well as visual. Use your phone when you're starting off. When I first started my YouTube channel I use my cracked iPhone four and I got my first 10,000 followers from a cracked iPhone four. So, do not feel like you have to have the best equipment to start. You really don't. Focus more on the quality of the content that you're producing over the camera quality. That's the firs thing I want to call that. And the second thing I want to call out and this is my final day is progress beats perfection. You can always improve a bad video. You can always improve bad audio. You can always make a video more interesting. You can always make a video more appealing.  What you cannot improve is a video that does not exist. So, I always aim for- it may not be perfect the second time, but you will get better. Progress beats perfection. Just do it. Do it anyway.

[00:18:10.480] - Liz
Yes, I'm always like, if you're not embarrassed by something you create a year ago, you're not growing.

[00:18:14.650] - Breonna
Right.

[00:18:15.730] - Liz
Done is better than perfect. Get it out there and that's how you're going to learn. I love that. Okay, so I know- I take notes, but then they're really messy. Okay, so I know you do have something for attendees. You can tell us a little bit about it?

[00:18:34.150] - Breonna
Yes. So, I have a resource gap and it is ten different documents. You get a YouTube and you get a little blocking check list. You get pretty much everything to like a beauty on camera guy. You get a decorative background guy. So, it's over ten different checklists, resources, printables to help you start your YouTube channel and grow your YouTube channel.

[00:18:56.800] - Liz
I'm going to need to go get that as well. So, the link to that is below to the right, if I'm setting us up correctly, is definitely on this page, Breonna. I mean, I know this was a super long, but I feel like I already learned so much. Thank you so much. Is there anything else you want to add or last minute tips or...?

[00:18:56.800] - Breonna
I think I hope that the session was helpful and you don't feel free to DM me on Instagram. I actually like Instagram DMs. You can find me on Breonna Queen. I like Instagram, YouTube. I am a friendly content creator. And most people you hit up and you never hear back, that's not me. So, feel free to write me on Instagram, YouTube, I'm on Facebook as well, or Pinterest. I like Pinterest too. And just say, "Hey, I discovered you from the Bloggers thing." You can say, "Hi, how are you doing." So yeah. Just say hi guys.

[00:19:49.860] - Liz
Yes. Thank you so much. Don't hesitate to reach out to her. She's awesome. She- I was so thankful she agreed to do Blogger Breakthrough Summit. Breonna again, thank you and I hope you have a good rest of your day. We'll catch you at the next session.

[00:20:02.070] - Breonna
Yes. Bye.
