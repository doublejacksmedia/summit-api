Welcome, everyone. Thank you for attending the Bloggers' Breakthrough Summit. My name is Sandra De Freitas, and today I'm going to go through how you, bloggers, can turn your expertise into membership sites. So what if you could have predictable revenue every single month without relying on ads, the algorithm changes, or sponsorships? What if I told you every month at the top of the month, you had $2,000 coming in, $5,000 coming in, $10,000 coming in? Would that be something that would have your attention? Would that be something that you would want ongoing? I'm going to say yes. My name is Sandra De Freitas. I've been an online entrepreneur for over 20 years. Since 2005, I've built, launched, managed, promoted, consulted on memberships. I did from the tech, to the behind the scenes, to in front of the scenes, for myself and for clients. I've been behind multiple six and seven-figure launches. I'm the creator of Engaged and Profitable Memberships. I am the host of memberships, launches, and Communities, the podcast and the group, and I'm the creator of Burnout Free Memberships. Something that I love to talk about is how to create a membership without that burnout feeling, without even getting close to burnout.

[00:01:26.150] - Sandra De Freitas
I'm also the host of a summit called Memberships: What's Working Now. I have created three memberships of my own, and another one I'm going to launch very soon. One is called Engaged Groups Membership. It's a membership that I use to help people launch, grow, manage, monetize, and engage their Facebook groups. It has been going strong since May of 2019. If you want to find out that information, you can go to my website, Engaged Groups, and there's an Everything tab, and you'll be able to take a look at that. Then we also have another one that I launched in 2024 called Engagement of Profitable Memberships. Here's where I help entrepreneurs with their memberships so that they don't burn out. They will have the content they need, all the resources they need, email templates, sales page templates, step by step spreadsheets to keep them organized. Everything that I use is in here. And then I also have a higher level membership called Emerald Elite. In here, I offer more customized help through not only a Facebook community, but also two group calls a month. And there's a VIP option where I offer support through voxer. Now, I am known for strategically planning launches, helping membership owners avoid burnout, making Memberships Sustainable, helping people create memberships with the content they already have.

[00:02:50.900] - Sandra De Freitas
And I have been told I'm the launch mom, and my clients also call me the Membership Fairie Godmother. I have been creating, love creating customized to to-do list for clients. So people tell me, What do I need to do next? And I'm like, Here's the next three things, the next five things. Go do them, come back and let me know when they're done. And then we just keep going. And I love doing that. And I wish someone would do that for me in my business. I encourage my clients to obtain recurring, reliable revenue month after month, year after year, because you never know what the economy is going to be like, and you never know how you're going to feel. So for some people, they have all the energy in the world, and they can continuously launch and get new sponsorships or get new brand ambassador stuff. But not everyone can do that. Not everyone has the energy for it. And sometimes when either you get sick or someone you love gets sick and you want to help take care of them, you need this predictable income month after month. I also love to make people laugh.

[00:03:48.190] - Sandra De Freitas
So let's get back to you. Have you ever wondered how to monetize your expertise as a blogger? Memberships are a very powerful revenue-generating tool. What if you could add another five figures to your annual revenue? What if I said to you, I can give you a membership idea and you can generate $10,000 more in the year or $10,000 more in the month? What if you didn't have to rely on display ads for your revenue? I know that things shift sometimes with how those ads are doing. And so what if you just had this predictability from a membership? What if you didn't have to hope for a sponsorship or influencer or brand ambassador opportunities? So with memberships, you have predictable money month after month. And once you sell it, once you will have this recurring revenue ongoing. You always have something to sell. And I love this. I love this for bloggers, especially. You have a lot of traffic coming into your site all the time. So why not use that to your advantage and have this membership where... Or have this membership where people can join anytime. And after reading a blog post or after reading a couple of blog posts, they're like, yes, I want more.

[00:05:01.870] - Sandra De Freitas
I want the detail. I want the DIY. I want everything from this. You also can provide a community for them that is different from the community that's just on your blog. So you could do a Facebook group, a Voxer group, a Slack group. I mean, there's so many options out there. What I love about this is you can have deeper connections with them, and they can have deeper connections with each other. It increases your credibility because now you're not just like... You're not just like a faceless blog. You are a human, and they have this credibility in your name just means more to them. Then if someone else, they could go to their membership and they have this relationship with them, if you didn't have a membership, they would have more of a, I don't want to say 2D relationship, but let's just say a 2D relationship as opposed to a 3D relationship. Your members can get together on Zoom, or they can watch a Facebook Live about you or your Facebook Live, or they can join you a Zoom. It doesn't have to be anything like what you're teaching. It could be something very fun and creative, like a holiday party or a spa night or a bring your favorite beverage night.

[00:06:09.830] - Sandra De Freitas
It increases trust and it's fantastic for research. If you're wondering What is the next blog that I need to put out there? What are the things that everyone wants to know about and need? It's one thing to ask them. It's another thing to experience it in your membership where they're going to be asking, How do I find this? How do I get this? How do I do A? How do I do B? Can you teach me how you do C? They will be telling you the content that they want, not only for the membership, but the content that they want to see in your blog. This is incredible research. And because they're closer to you, they will want to answer you. They will want to be helping you as well. They're going to want to see you succeed. So you will be providing exclusive content in the membership and providing more personalized experience. Now, when I say personalized, I don't mean you're providing an experience for every single person in your membership, but you're providing an experience for the whole group of the people in your membership. Let's identify your target audience. You probably already know this with your blog, but I want you to figure out what are your unique skills and what are you known for?

[00:07:18.730] - Sandra De Freitas
What are you known for? When people are asking you for help or your opinion, what are they asking you for? So my first coach, when I was trying to figure out what business was going to be, he had me email everyone I knew, friends, colleagues, neighbors, family, and say, If you were to pay me to solve a problem, what would that problem be? I had a variety of answers. Now, this goes back a long time ago, so none of those answers are even relevant right now because a lot has changed. But that gave me a jumping off point to know exactly where my business needs to go. So think about what people ask you about on your blog. What are the comments asking you for? What is your blog about and what are people asking about in the comments? In the comments, people might be asking something more specific, whether they're asking them in the blog comments or your social media comments, but they're asking for something a little bit more specific. Think about that and we could Use that to help build your membership. Market research to identify your target audience. Now, a target audience is specific.

[00:08:21.320] - Sandra De Freitas
It is not just women. We want to know who are these people? One of the things that you could identify with is who do you love working with the most. I mean, I love working with people who have a sense of humor. I can't just say that in my ads. I can't just whatever. But I know that if I bring out my sense of humor, they're going to be more attracted to that and they're going to be coming in. I know I need to elevate that in my life, bringing those fun people. But who do you love working with outside of that? Do you love working with corporate women or work-at-home moms or millennials? Who are those people? What do they need? And really, who do you identify with the most? And something I would like to look at is like... Let me go back one. Who were you before? Before you became who you are now, before you became this expert in this subject matter. Who were you before? Where were you struggling? What were you needing? What did you hope was out there that wasn't out there? And is that your membership? What did you hope was out there to help you?

[00:09:27.110] - Sandra De Freitas
What could it help you? Fast forward your success, but it wasn't out there. And so you can create that membership for those people. Now, you know your audience and who they're made up of. But I want you to look back like when you weren't a successful blogger, when you weren't this social media or this blogging expert, this subject matter spirit. How would you identify yourself? And these are a couple of things you can look at. What were the problems you were facing? What were your interests? What were your demographics? What was your age? So I have a client who teaches people how to dress. And this is not like she teaches them how to dress. Fashionably dress. And it's not necessarily on just really, really expensive, fashionable brands. She will look at many other brands and she will bring things to people so that they can not only, when they're looking at their wardrobe, they're finding products that work in many different ways. They're very versatile, very sustainable. And so she does this for people. She started blogging just on fashion, and now she has a membership where she's helping people pick up their wardrobes one season at a time.

[00:10:36.530] - Sandra De Freitas
One of the things she does is, I'm going to go into this a little later, but one of the things she does is she creates this like guide, the seasonal guide. And so the seasonal guide is almost... Picture like a magazine. And then she links over to all the stores where they can get those things. So she makes it super easy. What do I love about that? It saves them time, money, energy, and brain power. We're going to go to that in a second. So a niche is important because it helps your membership stand out. It attracts the dedicated members, and it builds a community that feels unique and exclusive, which also increases your loyalty, your engagement, and the value for everyone. So let's go into a membership model for bloggers. This is what I identify as being the best one for bloggers. There are other models, like an audio-only model or an audit model, where you're doing audits all the time. They may not be suitable for what you do. I mean, if you loved audio, you wouldn't be blogging, you would be doing audio, but you like typing and writing better. Yes, I could be wrong.

[00:11:45.430] - Sandra De Freitas
Let me know. But with a publisher model, it's actually a pretty easy model to put out there. So you typically deliver four pieces of content a month. I wouldn't do less than three, and I wouldn't do more than four. So I like to say I like to schedule out content for my publisher model memberships as once a week. So every Tuesday, things will go out. Now, some months have multiple Tuesdays, have five Tuesdays in the month. We just don't do anything for that last Tuesday. So think of four pieces that you can put out every month. One is released each week and it's the same deliverables each month. So if you're doing, like my client, well, she does a guide every quarter, but every month there is a Q&A, and every month there's a call with an expert. It's not like some months there's Q&A's and some months there's calls with experts. The members know to expect the same type of deliverable every single month. For example, you might have a training video, you might have a template, could be as simple as a Google Doc, you can have step-by-step instructions, easy for you to say, like a PDF, a video, or a checklist.

[00:12:57.550] - Sandra De Freitas
A Q&A is a really easy one to do. You don't even need to prepare. You could have people submit questions ahead of time, whether in a post in your community or a form that they fill out. This is especially good if you don't want to do your Q&A live, you could ask people for questions, record it, and then post it into your membership. So what to offer in your publisher membership. So I want you to ask yourself, what questions are you being asked over and over again? What are people wanting and needing from you that are above and beyond your blog? How can you shortcut people's success? So when they're looking at what you're creating and what you're doing for them, how can you shortcut their success? So for my client, she, instead of telling them what they need is black pants and beige pants and maybe a black and beige purse, she actually goes out and she finds those items and links to them so they don't have to spend their time researching and looking for the in style of those black pants, those beige pants and that black and beige purse. She gets it to them really quickly.

[00:14:08.620] - Sandra De Freitas
Okay. Can you save people time, money, energy, or brainpower? This is the key to a successful membership. If in the sales page of your membership, you say that by using your strategies, you can save them three hours of time a month. Amazing. If If you say, I'm going to... My client saves them time by trying to figure out what to wear all the time. She actually puts together outfits and shows them exactly how. So it's less time, less things that they have to think about. If you can save them money. In my Engaged Groups membership, I offer at least 12 posts, so captions and images that they could use in their Facebook group to keep engagement going. That is saving them time. If they try to figure out and put together these posts every month, It would probably take them... It takes me about an hour to come up with the content, and then I have someone creating the images for me, and that's another hour or two. So I'm saving them three hours a month. I'm also saving them the brainpower from figuring it out what to put. And you know what? If they didn't have those, it's likely they wouldn't even put engaging posts in their Facebook groups.

[00:15:22.570] - Sandra De Freitas
Isn't that interesting? They probably wouldn't even put engaging posts in their Facebook group because it would get to the point where they're like, I don't feel like doing this. I don't know what to put. I don't want to spend three hours on this. So it actually saves them the time, the brainpower. And they're also saving the money. So if they were going to hire someone to do this for them every single month, that would be money that they would have to spend. Does it Saving them energy? Absolutely. It saves them from trying to even think or not even putting that on their to-do list is a great thing. Look at your subject matter. Where can you help people save one or all four of these? Time. Where are you saving them time? How can you shortcut their success? How can you save them money? And so for some of you, you might be very modest about this. And maybe you need to talk to a friend, a sister, a colleague, what have you, and be like, This is what I'm going to put out there as a membership. Do you think it saves you time, money, energy, or brainpower?

[00:16:21.810] - Sandra De Freitas
Really just say that because you may not see... You're so expert in this that you don't even see how you're saving them these four things, but they will see it. And guess what? You put this on your sales page and people will be flocking to it. Just amazing because if you can save them any of these four things, nobody wants more on their to-do list. Nobody wants to spend more money on something. Nobody wants to spend more time on something. And they rather use their brainpower for other things. So this is key. So what to offer in your publisher membership? What are you known for? What are you known for? So what do you want to be known for? And what comes easily to you, but is a struggle for others? I think this is the question for all the bloggers. What comes so easily to you, but is a struggle for others? Outside of writing, Writing is a struggle for me. It is a struggle for me. But all the bloggers are great writers or you're good enough to be a blogger. I could not be a blogger. I've tried. But what in your subject matter comes so easily to you, but is a struggle for others.

[00:17:30.300] - Sandra De Freitas
If you're not sure what this is, go ask a friend, go ask a colleague, what is it that I do that you wish you could do faster or you wish you could do, period. And they will tell you exactly what that is. Okay, next, you've got, if you don't know what to offer, you could ask them. So there are times where we have opportunities where people can ask me questions. So you can see three years ago, I arrived in an appointment 30 minutes early and I was like, okay, what am I going to do now for the next 30 minutes? I don't even know how I arrived. It was not intentional. I had it in my calendar for a certain time and they're like, oh, you're really early. I'm like, oh, okay. So I just put it in my calendar wrong. So I thought, okay, I'm 30 minutes early for an appointment. I thought, I do a Q&A or ask me anything. What can I help you with? What questions can I answer for you? What I love about this is that the questions people asked were things that I didn't think about. There were things that I wouldn't have considered that they were even thinking about.

[00:18:28.700] - Sandra De Freitas
Because when we're experts, we're so high up the, I want to say the ladder, the mountain, that we haven't looked back and we forget what it's like for someone who's beginning or intermediate. So these are great if you don't know. Okay, what content do you give your readers that you could give an upgrade to? So for instance, if you have a blog about for teachers, could you give those teachers lesson plans every month? If you already have some products that you sell, there are a lot of teachers that have blogs, and then they sell things on... They sell the templates or the Google Docs or the Google presentations. Can those be part of your membership? Here are some ideas. You've got step-by-step tutorials, video demonstrations, behind-the-scenes. I love a good behind-the-scenes. Look, if you're a teacher and you show behind the scenes of how you set up your classroom, all the new teachers wouldn't want to see that. If you're a teacher and you're setting up for Halloween, all the teachers want to see your ideas for that. Oh, my goodness. Would they not love behind the scenes? Everyone loves it. Why? Because there's always something in there that we never thought of that we see you do.

[00:19:44.790] - Sandra De Freitas
It's eye-opening to us. It's like, wow, I can't believe you do it that way. Or behind the scenes of how you prep something on a Google Doc or on a spreadsheet. I can't tell you how many times I've done that and people are like, I didn't know that was a function personality, or that was an easy way to format that, or I didn't know you could do that in a Google Sheet. Behind the scenes are fantastic for that. Also, people are nosy. They want to know what you're doing behind the scenes. But behind the scenes are fantastic. You can offer a behind the scenes in your membership. Amazing. Sometimes this behind the scenes could just be like, what's going on in your life or how the blog is doing or what content you're coming up with. Maybe they get a sneak peek as to what is coming up in the blog. If you wanted to, you could do audits or feedback. So My client who does, she has a fashion blog and then she has a fashion membership, they actually have people submit outfits. They take pictures of their outfit and then they provide audits or feedback, whichever word you want to use.

[00:20:45.060] - Sandra De Freitas
And they do it in a very nice, kind way. This is not like a, do you remember the show, what not to wear? It is very kind. And so they might say, Hey, you might want to try a necklace with that, or you might want to try smaller earrings, or whatever it might be. But they provide audits and feedback. I absolutely love that because there is nothing like getting that personalized attention, but also everyone else can learn from it as well. You've got your Q&A, probably one of the easiest ones that you could offer. Remember, pick four of these. Do it with me. Let's say you do a baking or a recipe blog. There are times where I'm just like, I wish I could just watch them create it from beginning to end. Show me how you're doing it. And yes, there's a lot of YouTube videos out there. But if this was a community event and you could ask questions. So for instance, those of us with food intolerances could say, Hey, is there another substitute for this flour or even this gluten-free flour because I can't have this in it, they can answer it right then and there.

[00:21:52.810] - Sandra De Freitas
Or you, as the expert, will answer it right then and there. It is just a fantastic way. So people could actually bake with you at the same time or cook with you at the same time. Or if you do art, they can do the art with you at the same time. And that is a huge community builder. That is a fantastic thing. By the way, some of these you may not be able to do every month, but you could add them as bonuses to your membership When you feel like you want to connect with your audience more, you want to amp up the engagement, or perhaps you want to amp up retention, which is the thing, too. Yes? All right. Now you might think, well, do I didn't even have any content? Search your Google Drive. Go to Google. I went in to my Google Drive and I just searched up membership. I had all these different things that I had put together. I forgot about different ways. I went in and I would take this content and then I would upgrade it. If you've got a Facebook group or one that you're very active in, or even one that has your target people in it, I want you to go in there.

[00:22:54.180] - Sandra De Freitas
In the search bar, I want you to click or type in your subject matter and then the word question. Now, you You could also just put in your keyword, and then I could take that and be like, I could easily come up with answers to this. I could easily create a step-by-step guide or a do it with me or what have you. So you could also search Facebook itself. So if you go into Facebook on the top left, you'll see this. What I like to do is I like to take it a step further and I post from and I say your groups and your pages. So these are all the groups that I'm in, whether I'm the owner of them or just in them. And pages. I will look at what are people asking about in terms of all this content. And sometimes I'll even find my own answers. And then ask your people. When I was creating my membership, Engaged groups membership, back in May 2019, I asked this question, I'm wanting to put in a membership. Here are my ideas, here are the deliverables. What would you like? And then I had a lot of answers, and I took the top one there, and I made that my membership.

[00:24:00.030] - Sandra De Freitas
So I had templates, things that they should do every single month. May 23rd, I went live and I revealed my membership. Now, if you think you need to wait so you have everything polished and ready to go, I will tell you you don't. And let me tell you how I know this. My hair is messy. This shirt is so cold and wrinkly. I launched this membership. Within five minutes, I had eight people join me. And by the end of the week, I had 97 people join this membership. I kept the cost low because I wanted to really fill it with a bunch of people. I wanted to get feedback. I wanted to get testimonials. I wanted to get them results. I wanted to get them talking about it. And that's exactly what we did. So remember, May seventh, I was asking for ideas. May 23rd, I launched it in 16 days. It wasn't pretty. And in fact, I said to them, the content will start going live June first, and we did it. So some promotion ideas for you. You can create your own ad on your blog. You can email your list if you've got one.

[00:24:58.810] - Sandra De Freitas
Create multiple blog posts that would drive people to the membership. So I know you know how to do that. And you can also host a Zoom or a live community call to announce it. Just be like, Hey, we don't get together. We should get together. Why don't you come to my call? And you can say, Bring your favorite beverage, bring your favorite whatever hat, whatever you want to do, bring your favorite baking good, whatever is related to your blog, and let's get together. And you can tell them all about it. Say, People have been asking me for the step by step on this. People have have been asking me how I do this. People have been asking me how it takes me five minutes to plan my year or whatever it might be and say, How would you like to do that? I'm going to save you time, money, energy, and brainpower. Would you like to come and join us. So point people to your membership at the end of each blog post. You could do that too. Of course, it all depends on what your arrangements are with brand ambassador stuff, sponsorship stuff, and ads.

[00:25:58.680] - Sandra De Freitas
But these are just and then add a membership or shop button on your blog. I know this sounds obvious, but it's something we forget about. So add it to your menu bar. Next steps. Ask your audience what it needs. Create a list of upgrade experiences, the content you have, questions. Promote it. Deliverable ideas. Okay, so here are some ideas for you. We've got audits. I've talked about this one before. Challenges. You can do a monthly challenge. You can do a quarterly challenge if you wanted to offer it as a bonus. You can do checklist for them. Everyone loves a quick checklist. Great for them. A community. I always mark my community as a bonus because if someone doesn't want to join the community, it's fine. You can create some done for you services. I've seen people do this for teacher planning for teachers. All done for them. You can have guest coaches or guest speakers as one of your deliverables. You've got templates that you can create for them, webinar slides, lesson plans, business plans, project plans, you name it. Would you like more than 80 membership deliverables? I'm giving them to you for free.

[00:27:03.570] - Sandra De Freitas
Normally, I sell this as $9. Is that part of one of my main courses? This is called Structure and Style. The Structure and Style course is the starter course to build a membership. So if you're thinking about building a membership, I highly recommend you go and grab that. In fact, when you sign up for this, you will get $100 off the structure and style course. Let's go into pricing. I want you to make this price a no-brainer. I can talk about pricing, but everyone in every industry is going to be different. I want you to think about your pricing. But what I want you to do is make it a really easy yes, especially the beginning, especially the very first launch. So if it's $20 a month, is that going to make or break them? I want you to think about is also the pricing for the year. So you can offer a monthly, annual. If you're not sure you want to do this for an entire year, do not offer an annual. You could offer quarterly, but you have monthly and you have annual. What I do is I take the monthly plan and I multiply by 10 to get the annual.

[00:28:01.410] - Sandra De Freitas
So it's for those who can't do math in your sales page, I'll say it's like getting two months free, and that's really easy for people to calculate. So for founding members, because they're early adopters and they're coming in with either little or no content already available, give them the best rate. So whatever you think you want your membership to be, maybe lower it down a little bit just for the founding members, just for the first group of people to come in. And you could say the first hundred or the first hundred before February first or February first or the first hundred, whatever comes first. That's up to you. But I always like to give them a bit of a price discount. Why is that? Well, they're coming in. There's very little content for them to begin with. They're taking a chance on you. They are going to provide feedback to make your membership better. They're going to provide the testimonials to make your membership better, and they're going to need this incentive to join. They're going to start telling people about this. The better it is, the more people you can get in, Just like I did for my membership, my membership was like $25 a month or $250 for the year.

[00:29:05.130] - Sandra De Freitas
It is double that price now, but I kept it low for a reason because I really wanted a bunch of people in. Here's what we went over. We went over memberships, how they're a powerful revenue rating tool. There's benefits to it, lots of benefits. We went over your target market, the publisher model for bloggers, what to offer, looking at the content you have, looking at the content you create, and pricing. So turning your expertise Get into a membership site can be a game changer for your blogging career. Embrace the opportunity to monetize your knowledge, build a loyal community, and create sustainable income stream. If you want to come and follow me, go to engagedgroups.com/group. That I'll take you to our Facebook group. And there is a freebie for you in there. If you enter your email address, only your email address, it'll give you the tech stack that I use for my business. It'll give you ways to engage a free group and ways to engage your paid members. And you can also have a listen to my podcast, and engagedgroups.com/podcast. I would love to see you in both of these. Bye for now.
