[00:00:00.000] - Liz Stapleton, Host
All right, guys. I'm very excited about this conversation with sought-after business consultant Danielle Levy. She helps online business owners expand with clarity and efficiency after her experience in the traditional business world, Danielle took her marketing expertise and systems acumen to consulting and guiding entrepreneurs toward becoming the CEOs they were meant to be. Danielle, thank you so much for joining us and being part of this year's Summit.

[00:00:36.270] - Danielle Levy
Thank you for having me. It's such a thrill, so thank you.

[00:00:39.530] - Liz
Yeah, so we're going to be talking about why every business needs an ICE plan. Let's start with what is an ICE plan?

[00:00:46.000] - Danielle
Sure. So ICE stands for "In Case of Emergency." And I would give the additional context, not only does every business need an ICE plan, every household needs an ICE plan also. But yes, we will have this conversation in the context of businesses. I would also elaborate on that even though ICE is emergency, it's a vacation plan. It's a, "What if this happens plan?" It's a, "yes, but I already have this in place, it will give me more flexibility later plan."

[00:01:17.320] - Liz
I'm sick when I'm not planning to be, plan.

[00:01:20.930] - Danielle
Exactly. I think the connotation with this conversation is that something scary is going to happen and it gets people's adrenaline going, and people don't want to think about it and all that stuff. But also I would really encourage people to think about the possibility and the freedom that comes with just taking the time to get this stuff in order.

[00:01:43.600] - Liz
Yes. Okay, because I feel like it can encompass so much, how do you even go about starting to create one and figuring out what one looks like for you and your business?

[00:01:54.880] - Danielle
Yeah, I think there's a couple of ways to do it. If you're in the throes of business and you're like, "I can't even deal with this," and it's the last thing you want to be thinking about, it can be as simple as creating a folder in your inbox of, "Oh, I know this has something to do with my ICE plan. I don't really know what yet, but let me just store it there. Or that this piece of mail came in, let me shove it in an envelope." That's the bare-bones, very passive approach to it, but at least you're thinking about it, it's aware.

[00:02:32.900] - Danielle
If you're like me, and this is because it has to be routine for me, not because I'm any more on top of it than anybody else. I'm a freaking mess in all parts of my personal and business life. I work it in as part of my ritual. Every month I do my P&L for my business, and as part of that, it's review. There's literally a hyperlink that goes right to my ICE plan that says, "Did you review this?" Then it's just a very organic process.

[00:03:05.430] - Danielle
I also take —we have a long weekend coming up here. I will set aside relaxing time. What else have I changed in my business that can I fold in? Where it's like low-pressure, dedicated, uninterrupted client time to really bring things together. I would say it's —I don't think it's anyone's favorite thing to look forward to in a business, but think about past habits that you've had in your business like, "I have to file my taxes or I have to go through this massive RFP," or whatever that mindset is that you get in when you have to do the thing that seems so big and scary, even if it's not really, that's where you want to get yourself to.

[00:03:45.180] - Liz
Okay so,  you say you have a thing where it's like review your ICE plan. What is your ICE plan? Give us some examples of what goes into an ICE plan. What does it look like?

[00:03:55.320] - Danielle
Sure. And so first of all, on my website, there are ICE plans. So the way that I think about it is I take my business apart. There's three parts to my business. There's the front of the house, sales, marketing, visibility, my social media accounts, etc. There's the house, which are my offers, anything that makes me money in the business. And then the back of the house is operations, legal, finance, team, all that stuff that keeps the business going.

[00:04:29.710] - Danielle
That's how I break my business apart. I think about my business in terms of what blind spots exist "that if this thing happened, what would be the follow-up?"

[00:04:41.920] - Danielle
The example that I give, and I think this is a convenient example because you have a little friend there with you right now. I was in a multimillion-dollar launch for a client of mine, and our tech VA's furry friend passed away mid-launch. I am a pet owner. My kids, my pets, they're on that same wavelength. But the level of AWOL that this person took as a result of that loss was not anything like I had ever seen before and put the entire launch at risk. And the problem was, this was the problem with the business. One, the tech VA was the only person that had one set of login credentials that we needed because we had created it not too long ago. And two, the owner of the business could not figure out how to log into her website so that we could change a couple of things. I see the cringe that you're making. Had there been an ICE plan...

[00:05:43.930] - Liz
No, it happens.

[00:05:45.540] - Danielle
It happens, right? Yeah. It would have been like, "This is your host. Here's how you get to the password." We would have thought about who else needs access other than this tech VA, who again, I'm not meaning to sound cold, it was just like, "Go grieve your cat. But by the way, this launch has to still happen."

[00:06:06.380] - Danielle
Had there been a little more planning in that situation, had we not realized there was this blind spot in the business of this particular tech VA that had a little bit too much control, a lot of the anxiety would have just been a non-issue. It's an example that never has to happen again, but those are the kinds of things that —when I think about putting together an ICE plan, it's what's the thing am I not planning for, that if it happens? What's my risk tolerance for if this thing happens, how am I going to respond to it?

[00:06:38.110] - Liz
It's almost like a place to house all the information so that if something falls out, you have the information to give someone to pull in.

[00:06:47.150] - Danielle
Exactly.

[00:06:47.940] - Liz
Okay.

[00:06:48.830] - Danielle
Exactly. And also in the same regard, most of us got into business or work for ourselves for a certain amount of either time freedom or money freedom, or whatever the "is" that we're looking for. I can step away for vacation and my right-hand person has a copy of my ICE plan, I cannot be bothered. And that's really nice.

[00:07:10.390] - Liz
Yeah. No. Okay. I like that. All right. So if you  —this is like a completely new concept to you or to people in our audience, where would you suggest they start in creating one? Where is a good starting place?

[00:07:25.410] - Danielle
Gather what you have. And that can be when you go to pay your monthly invoices. Who are you paying? "Okay, I'm paying these people on my team. I'm paying for these types of softwares." Really just work very organically to just start gathering. And it's one of those things that once you start doing it and you figure out what your system is, it all just flows together. And I feel like it, for me, it's become a bit of a game. Like, "Ooh, this thing came up or this thing went away. How is my ICE plan doing?" So, just the most important thing I feel like is get started and to be thinking about it. Because unfortunately, in that case of that launch that I described, you don't want to ever go, "Oh, shoot. I wish I had an ICE plan." If you're going, "Oh, shoot. I wish I had an ICE plan," then it's too late. It's not too late...It's...

[00:08:28.810] - Liz
A lot harder and a lot more stressful.

[00:08:30.010] - Danielle
A lot harder.

[00:08:31.340] - Liz
Okay. What are some maybe mistakes you've seen people make in creating ICE plans? Maybe overdoing it, not doing enough, or not being able to find things? What are the mistakes and how can they be avoided?

[00:08:47.190] - Danielle
Sure. I actually think the biggest mistake is not specifically related to the ICE plan. I think the mistake is, as businesses are successful and there's money coming in, there's not enough points that people pause and realize, "This business is more than I thought it would be," or "Oh my gosh, look at all of these assets that I have created." It's that snowball of how businesses grow. It never feels like a good time to say, "Oh, I need an ICE plan now."

[00:09:25.080] - Danielle
Unfortunately, I've seen it where you stop thinking about —all of us are so passionate about our businesses and our clients' businesses, but not pausing to say, "Whoa, I'm not protecting my intellectual property."

[00:09:41.240] - Danielle
I was working for one of the biggest funnel strategists there is, and one of her students, and she sells her course to thousands and thousands of students every time she opens cart, actually took her website and did a space (??) — she just ripped it off. This funnel strategist was like, "Well, I don't have anything to protect against that." This massive business, bigger than I could ever dream, and there was no IP protection.

[00:10:12.620] - Danielle
It's less about doing the ICE plan the wrong way, and more realizing as this unfolds and as my business grows, and as I come into who I am as a business owner, and what I'm doing for my clients, really taking the time to go, "Oh, wow, this is a real thing." And the cost of, if this goes south of what that's going to —it's not having that light bulb moment of, "What do I need to do to protect this?" I think that's a mistake.

[00:10:44.160] - Liz
So yeah, if you guys missed the legal sessions. Those happen typically day one, I'm not sure what day we're airing this one, but upgrade or go back and watch them if they're still available, depending on when this session is airing. But the legal sessions, this is why we have them.

[00:11:03.440] - Danielle
And you know what? A lot of people, it's not even because they didn't have time to do the thing. Most people, unless you get your legal experts involved or your operations, your HR, whoever those people are, you don't even understand what your blind spots are until you get the expert involved and then you go, "Oh, wow, I better do something about this." So, it's that awareness of where you're at, how fast time goes, how much we're creating on a day-to-day business that to not just be so in the business, but actually to come up for air and say, "How am I....."

[00:11:42.390] - Liz
See the forest through the trees.

[00:11:44.570] - Danielle
Yeah.

[00:11:45.470] - Liz
Yeah. Working on the business rather than in it, it's yeah, which takes practice. It's a skill that you have to develop just like anything else. I don't think it comes naturally to anybody.

[00:11:54.670] - Danielle
No.

[00:11:55.950] - Liz
Just keep that in mind if you're struggling with it. Okay, so we've touched on a few real-world examples. You mentioned Tech VA or whatever. Let's do some more. Let's dive deep, I guess, in terms of like, who am I paying? We've got, how do you log into things? What are some other elements that would go into an ICE plan that you think? I think I see a lot of people that plan a maternity leave, and maybe don't call it an ICE plan, but same idea. So let's get some more examples going.

[00:12:34.740] - Danielle
Thinking about the idea of —I don't know if you're familiar with Rocket Fuel and Visionaries and Integrators and that concept? Just that whole idea of, as CEOs really, I think there's this huge mentality of stepping away from the business, having team members that you trust, everyone being in their zone, which I am all for. But at the same time, I don't think you want that gap to get so large that you don't know what's happening in your business. I'll give you an example that I fell into.

[00:13:17.880] - Danielle
Just before we started recording, we were having a chat, and I was talking about my right hand. I was quite literally in a situation where my calendar links got all messed up. I'm embarrassed to say it. I didn't know what the scheduling plan looked like. I was so used to, "I'm doing all these visionary things. I've got my right hand, the businesses." And when push came to shove and I had to move a simple appointment on my own calendar, I couldn't figure out how to do it. And these particular meetings were critical meetings that I needed to show up and be my best self.

[00:13:50.030] - Danielle
So all of us and any of us can step into these things. So, it's understanding I think, how to be informed and to know if I'm not informed, how can I become informed quickly while still really empowering teams and team members to be in their day-to-day, most productive spots.

[00:14:12.090] - Liz
Okay. How do you keep an ICE plan organized? How would you go about organizing it? So, yes, you've got all the information that people can step in, figure it out, but how do you —it could potentially be a lot of information and trying to then sift through it. Do you have any advice on that?

[00:14:34.920] - Danielle
I heard a couple of different —if I don't answer your question, just let me know and I'll go at it again. So for the purposes of conversation, go to my website, look at the physical examples of how these are laid out. I think that visual will be really helpful for people to say, "This isn't that hard to organize this."

[00:14:56.200] - Danielle
Go take a look. There's plenty of ICE plans out there if folks aren't a fan of mine. In terms of the physical organization of it, there are examples available. In terms of sifting through the information, my feeling is, when in doubt include it. You don't know what you don't know and what you're going to need, and then break it down based on —in the same way, use your P&L as the guide. "Okay, these are my software costs every month. What is rolled up in this number? Okay, I know I'm spending" —I'm making up a number here, "$1,000 on software. Okay, what are all of the pieces that are rolling up to that number? Oh, do I know what those logins are? Do I know what I'm paying for that? Oh, wait, I'm paying for that thing and we don't even use it anymore. Get rid of that one." It's an audit for the rest of your business and how things are working. If there's any outliers like, "What does this piece of software do?" or "I don't know what this does?" that should be the flag that goes off like, "Let me investigate this a little bit more," because I think ICE plans are a great way to keep your business in check and keep your audit tight.

[00:16:09.970] - Liz
Okay. Where do you suggest your ICE plan live? So that you have access to it, potentially other people have access to it. Like, where does it live and how does it stay up to date?

[00:16:23.920] - Danielle
Sure. So in terms of access, I'm going to keep it real. My right-hand person has access to it, and my dad has access to it, and that's it. You don't want—you want to make sure —you don't want it floating everywhere. I have it locked up in a secure, like this set of passwords will get you to this folder, will get you to that folder, type thing. Because again, you don't want it to be in the wrong hands either. Right? Configure it in a way that makes sense to you. If it's you don't want to include your passwords and your passwords are in DashLane or LastPass, or wherever we keep your passwords, that's cool, too. It just has to be a logical; somebody from the outside comes in, how do they know how to navigate through your business to get the snapshot of it?

[00:17:22.140] - Danielle
In terms of updating it, like I said, I review it every month when I do my P&L. A lot of folks do quarterly or H1, H2 annual planning. I think the ritual is the most important. You don't want it to be like that pesky doctor's appointment that you put off, you put off and then you're like, "Wait a minute. It's been three years since I've been here. What do you mean? How could that much time have passed?" That's not what you want. So it's the ritual of how do I feel like I'm in a really good place to make sure that it is up to date?

[00:17:55.120] - Liz
I feel a little bit of tact because I am overdue for scheduling a doctor's appointment by a month, not three years, because I have to find a new doctor. Okay. No, I like that. Is there any aspect of creating an ICE plan for business that we haven't covered or that you feel like, "Please take note of this and do this?"

[00:18:20.830] - Danielle
I would say do what you can as often as you can. It's never going to be perfect. Don't wait for that opportunity where I have a whole day dedicated to my ICE plan. Let me tell you that day is not coming that you're like, "Let me work on my ICE plan." It also is something that you have to have patience with. "Oh, I know I have insurance. I don't know who the provider is, or I have the provider, but I don't know the policy number." It's just something that you just want to keep chipping away at. Like all of our businesses, this is how we got here. Don't be afraid to involve your team. "Hey, this is our tech stack." Have your team member, "I need these six pieces of information." Or go to your bookkeeper and say, "Hey, I noticed this was my software cost, or this was my team cost. Can you give me a breakdown of those invoices?" Just incorporate it into your mindset.

[00:19:22.290] - Liz
Yeah. No, and I will say even if you manage to set aside a day, you're going to get to that day and you're going to completely miss things because it's not at the top of mind, or you're not able to brainstorm it. So unless you had kept a list of everything you need to actually gather that day, it's not going to be a very successful day regardless. Okay, last question I want to ask is an ICE plan versus SOPs in your business. Difference, how they work together, how they don't, like because it's— ICE plan is sounding a little bit like an SOP to me.

[00:19:55.340] - Danielle
I can see that I hadn't actually ever considered that, but keep in mind your SOP or your SOP vault is accessible to your team. This is not accessible to your team. And quite frankly, if God forbid something were to happen to me, and I needed my dad who has a copy of my ICE plan to step into my business, my dad isn't going to know what to do with 99% of the SOPs in my business. My dad needs to know this is my right-hand person. She knows how to get in touch with all of my clients. She knows how to clear my calendar. She knows how to get to this particular piece of software that needs to get paid for. So it's one step removed from the SOPs of your business. So yes, is it an SOP for my dad to follow about my business? Yes, but it's more...

[00:21:03.170] - Liz
It's the forest versus trees SOP.

[00:21:06.120] - Danielle
Exactly. And it's the glue of how do we get things done. "Okay, this person is my website host. This is the phone number. This is the website. This is the account number." Then my dad can go contact my tech VA and my marketing person, and they have the tools that they need to do their job, which normally I wouldn't give them that much access to my business. Does that make sense?

[00:21:33.460] - Liz
Yeah. No, that does make sense. I like that distinction. All right. Now I need to put together an ICE plan for my business is what I'm learning. I thought I was behind on SOPs, which I am. But now I'm like, "Well dang it, I really should have this together."  Which is something I thought about, because I'm like, my family, and this is probably going to be true for most bloggers and online business owners, they don't totally understand what I do in general. They're like, "What do you do? How do you make money? What? What?" And so having some details that if something happened, they could handle some things for me.

[00:22:12.440] - Danielle
And if I could just add the difference of —and my poor dad, he's not actually —he doesn't even know I'm having this conversation about him. If I am not available and my clients can't get a hold of me, that puts my business at risk. If they get an email from my dad or my assistant or whoever it's going to be that says, "Danielle is fine. She had an appendicitis. She'll be back in three days." That simple piece of communication is the difference in my client's business and me potentially having a huge financial loss.

[00:22:48.460] - Liz
Yeah. Like communication is key. With the Summit, I'm juggling a lot of speakers. And I'm like, "Look, if you have to change something," you're like, "Hey, my kid got sick, I can't record." I'm like, "Okay, cool. Kids come first. Absolutely. Totally understand that." But just making that communication as opposed to radio silence and I'm following up and I'm following up and I'm following up and I'm not getting anything, that drives me crazy. So yes. Okay. And I think you have something for attendees or you want them to follow you on social or share?

[00:23:23.870] - Danielle
Yeah. So I think the easiest thing to do is, my website is danielleclevy.com. I'm on Instagram. I respond to every message that comes in. It's @danielle_c_levy.

[00:23:39.400] - Liz
And that'll be link below.

[00:23:42.130] - Danielle
Yes. I am so grateful for the community that has gotten me to this point in my career and in my business that if people have questions about anything that I've said or that they're wondering about, I'm just going to answer them. I get excited to talk about this stuff, and I get excited for people to be really successful in what they're doing because you don't know what you don't know. Anything that people need, I can't stress enough, just ask me. Just ask you. You've got an incredible lineup of speakers here. I'm positive that the feeling is mutual across the board.

[00:24:19.800] - Liz
Yes, absolutely. And then I think you've got something for the "Speaker Bonus Bundle" or is that undecided yet?

[00:24:28.340] - Danielle
I'm not saying it's undecided. It's a big surprise.

[00:24:30.780] - Liz
Okay, let's call it that. And if you guys have the upgrade, definitely do that. And I'll have information on what is in there below this video.

[00:24:38.610] - Danielle
That would be perfect. Thank you.

[00:24:40.300] - Liz
All right, Danielle, thank you so much. This was such a helpful conversation. I learned a lot and I'm sure everyone watching did as well.

[00:24:46.920] - Danielle
Yes, thank you for having me. I really appreciate it.
