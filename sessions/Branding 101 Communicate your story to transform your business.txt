Liz Stapleton [00:00:00]:
Alright, guys. I'm really excited for this session with Melanie from My Billie Designs. Melanie, thank you so much for taking the time.

Melanie Lea [00:00:06]:
Thank you. I'm so excited.

Liz Stapleton [00:00:08]:
Yes. Because it's not the first time we worked together, so I'm really thrilled that you agreed to be part of the summit because you're so good at what you do. Can you you're gonna be talking about branding. Can you give us a little bit about your background and then kinda give us the highlights of what we're gonna learn in your session?

Melanie Lea [00:00:23]:
Yeah. Absolutely. So I'm kind of like the designer that became a designer because I was figuring out how to do it myself, which is why I think this is perfect for this audience because I know that, we're gonna be specifically talking about like branding and design and that can be really complicated whenever you try to like start learning the technical stuff. And it's like, I'm gonna, I'm gonna throw all of this stuff at you from the DIY perspective of just like, let's make this nice and easy and approachable. So like I said, I'm a self taught designer. I started my business in 2012. It kinda just happened to me. I actually started as a Blogger and then my business evolved and grew from that.

Melanie Lea [00:01:05]:
So that's another reason why the summit is so cool because I really do believe in the power of blogging. So in this presentation today, we're gonna be talking about what a brand even is. There are things that people definitely think of when they hear the word brand, like your logos and your colors. And we're gonna take it a little bit deeper and kinda layer on the information so that it all really, really makes sense and feels actually doable. You're gonna learn kind of like the principles of branding, and then we're gonna go through some fun exercises so that you can kind of reflect on the prompts and think about how they apply to you. And you're gonna be able to kinda like write down your notes and, personalize this content to you as we go. So this is very interactive. It's very fun.

Melanie Lea [00:01:46]:
I do this workshop live and people love it. They go nuts about it. So I'm hoping that this is just the most information packed thing that you find today and that it really, really helps you uncover a lot about your brand essentials.

Liz Stapleton [00:02:00]:
I'm super excited because I I I feel like the great thing about this Summit is I, oh, I knew I need all these sessions too. I'm gonna be like, oh, because I I I DIY it. Right? And I you know, it doesn't come naturally to me, so I'm session. I know I'm sure I've got a lot of work to do on my branding, so let's let's go ahead and dig in.

Melanie Lea [00:02:19]:
Yeah. Okay. Let's go. Hey, guys. I'm so excited to talk to you about branding 101. My main goal for you after this training is to understand how you can communicate your story to transform your business or your blog. You might be like me and starting with a blog and wanna turn that into a business. So I wanna help you make so much sense out of all of your ideas and bring clarity to the design and branding that you do for your blog or your business.

Melanie Lea [00:02:47]:
So before we begin, I've got a digital worksheet. There should be a link to it below. I'm gonna let you know whenever there's times in this training where I want you to fill out things. This is gonna be very workshop oriented. We are gonna be working through things as the presentation goes along. I'm gonna kinda present ideas to you. I want you to reflect on them and think about how they apply to you and what your unique spin on that is. You'll be able to fill it out.

Melanie Lea [00:03:13]:
And then at the end of the presentation, you'll have this amazing little worksheet that you can go to, and it's gonna summarize all of the big ideas that you have and give you a direction you can go in for your branding and for your design. The main things that I wanna go over with you are what is branding exactly? There are a lot of misconceptions about branding. It can be kind of a confusing thing if you don't live in the design world, and I totally get it. We're gonna go over some common misconceptions so that we can totally clear it up and you can have a better idea of what a brand is, and then that will help you form the plan later on in this workshop. So the second thing we're gonna go over is how to form your brand foundation. Most people, they skip this step and then they feel very shaky in their branding. They don't feel very confident in what they're putting out into the world. So we're gonna eliminate that for you by coming up with your brand foundation.

Melanie Lea [00:04:08]:
This is gonna make sure everything that you do in your blog or your business or your brand feels like you, it's gonna help you feel more confident. Then we're gonna take that foundation, and we're gonna turn it into a plan. So I'm gonna tell you some very, kinda like some basics about fonts and colors and photography, and we're gonna come up with a plan for you during this training. And then lastly, I wanna talk to you about how to build brand consistency because that could be something that's a little tough for people. And I wanna make sure that you feel as confident as possible with your brand and with your blog. Okay. So let's go over what is branding exactly. There are 2 big common branding misconceptions that we're gonna go over.

Melanie Lea [00:04:53]:
So the first one is that branding is just your logo or just your visuals. So let's take a look at this example here. When you look at this, you think, okay, there's a logo. It's kinda got this quirky, layout. There's this bright red pattern. I'm seeing the colors. It's kinda bright and punchy, but soft at the same time. It feels a little classic.

Melanie Lea [00:05:17]:
You see the different specific visual elements, like the colors and the fonts and the layout, the pattern, that kinda thing. And what most people don't understand is that this isn't your brand. These are just the visual elements that someone's come up with to personify your brand. So let's take a deeper look into this. So we're gonna kinda go over the umbrella of what a brand is. You can think of this is kinda like the big overarching thing that a brand is, and then there are layers underneath it. So the overall thing about your brand is how people perceive you. It's not about your colors.

Melanie Lea [00:05:55]:
It's not about your fonts. It's not about your logo. It is about the perception of your blog brand or business. Now branding, that is when you bring elements together in an intentional way so that you can build out that reputation and help your audience make better consumer decisions around your blog or your brand. And when I say bring elements together, there are Right specific types of elements that I want you to think about that come together to form this reputation. So the first one is your brand identity. This is the visual attributes that are gonna create the look and the feel of your brand. So this is, like, the fonts, the colors, your logo patterns, other graphic elements.

Melanie Lea [00:06:36]:
So we go back to this example. I thought about the reputation that I wanted this brand to build and what I wanted people to think about them. So we've got a quirky kinda layout for the logo, but we're using classic fonts, a really pretty handwritten script. We've got this bright punchy red pattern, but we've also got kind of like a softer cream color and a softer purple color. The person that would connect with this brand probably has a very high taste level. They like nicer things, but they are also quirky and fun. These are the visual elements that I use to personify that. So we've got our visual elements, and then we've also got our brand messaging.

Melanie Lea [00:07:18]:
This is a very, very huge, big important thing with branding. Most people think it's all about the colors and the fonts and the logo, but your brand messaging is way more important for building a very intentional reputation because visuals attract people, but how you talk about your business and how you make people feel through your messaging is what actually engages loyalty and keeps people coming back. So your brand messaging is really important. This is your brand's voice and your narrative. It's what fosters loyalty and connection between you and your audience. And, yes, we are breaking all of this down. I'm gonna help you make sense of all of this so that you have an actual plan. We're gonna spend a lot of time during this workshop going through your worksheet and making this personalized to you.

Melanie Lea [00:08:06]:
Saying your brand is just visuals is like saying a human is just their physical appearance. This would be like saying that you are just your beautiful blue eyes when really you're a whole person underneath your blue eyes. You have, feelings and you have hobbies and interests and things that make you quirky. We can't just focus our branding on the visuals. We have to pay attention to what makes your brand unique. Just like there are things about you that make you unique that have nothing to do with your physical appearance. So that's the brand foundation that we're gonna form in just a little bit. Now one more misconception I wanna go over is that people think that your brand is all about what you like as the person behind the brand.

Melanie Lea [00:08:51]:
People think, okay, I like this so my brand needs to personify this. I see this all the time with my clients. You need to embrace turning people away. This is something that people get really, really scared about. They they want it to feel like them and then they also want to appeal to everybody. But what happens with a brand that, tries to attract everyone and talk to everyone and make literally everyone like them is a brand that is super forgettable. So you need to embrace turning people away, and you also need to think about your audience and prioritize what they will want to see over what you want to see. Okay.

Melanie Lea [00:09:29]:
So now that you've got a better idea of what a brand even is, we can form your brand foundation. This is where the training's gonna get a lot of fun because we're gonna personalize this stuff to you, and you're gonna come up with a plan. So I want you to think of the layers of a brand kind of like an upside down heart. We're gonna be building this in layers. And getting the layers in the correct order is gonna be very, very important because that's gonna help you build a solid foundation for your brand. You kinda build the bottom step, and then once that's built out, the next layer is easier to execute, and then the next layer is even easier to execute. So this is gonna make everything feel way easier for you. So you can write this down in your worksheet.

Melanie Lea [00:10:14]:
The first thing that you need to form is your brand core. These are gonna be things like the the qualities and the values that make you and your brand super unique. After that, you can think about your audience. This is gonna be really important because we wanna create a brand that attracts the specific audience that you want to bring into your blog or your brand. Then we can go over your messaging. That's that narrative that we were talking about. That's your story. That's the thing that's gonna actually help people, feel like they're home with your brand.

Melanie Lea [00:10:50]:
They're gonna feel like you just completely understand them because you got your messaging right. Then once all of that is figured out, you can think about your visual elements. Like I said earlier, most people think that your logos and your colors and your fonts and your patterns and your photos are the most important things. But you can see here that this is actually 4th on the priority list. We need to worry about the brand core, your audience, and your messaging first. And then once you've got all of those nailed down, we can focus on your visual elements. And you want to do this because most people try to start with visual elements and they don't have anything that gives them direction or flow with what their visual elements need to actually be. Most people have too many ideas.

Melanie Lea [00:11:34]:
They don't know how to make sense of it, and it's because they're skipping these first three things that would help them navigate which direction to go. Okay. So after you've got these four things down, then you can focus on your marketing. Most people think, oh my gosh, I've gotta, like, get my marketing figured out. I've gotta figure out, like, how am I gonna promote my blog? How am I gonna promote my brand? And you're really kinda putting the cart in front of the horse. You need to figure out all of these other things underneath it first, and then your marketing becomes so much easier. Okay. So I'm really excited to dive into this.

Melanie Lea [00:12:08]:
1st, we're gonna get really, really clear on your brand core. So in the worksheet, what I want you to do is I want you to write out your mission. I want you to figure out what is your purpose. I also want you to think about your goals. Where do you wanna be in 1 to 5 years? You're kind of in this right now, but what's the longer term plan? What's everything look like 1 year from now, 2 years from now, 3 years from now? I want you to sit and I want you to think about these. Then, what is your vision for your blog? What do you wanna represent in your industry and in your niche? Then you can think about your actual values. So what's important to you? These are gonna be things that once you think about them, it's gonna help you form a clearer picture for what to do next. So think about what your mission is, what your goals are over the next few years, the vision that you have, and then your values.

Melanie Lea [00:13:03]:
I do have a quiz that will help you kinda uncover a lot of this and help you implement what we're talking about today a little bit more deeply. It's a brand personality quiz. And once you take the quiz and opt into the follow-up email sequence, I'm gonna help you really, really come up with your list of core values and just take this training a little bit further and show you how to work it into your messaging and your design and your audience. So be sure to take advantage of that. But for now, just kind of quickly write out some of the things that, revolve around your mission and goals and vision and values, and then we'll keep going. Next is figuring out what is your brand personality. So what do you wanna be known for? And I these questions might seem a little bit redundant, kind of, want to keep asking you questions that help you go a little bit deeper and figure out the different angles that you can kind of come from to make your brand very special and unique.

Melanie Lea [00:13:59]:
So I wanna just keep drilling down and asking questions that get you thinking. So think about what do you wanna be known for? How do you want others to describe you? Do you see how these revolve around the reputation you wanna build? We wanna be very, very intentional about that reputation because it's gonna make everything else so much easier later on. And then I also want you to think about how do you wanna make someone feel? So me for my own brand, what I wanna be known for is how I make people feel. I want them to feel like they are seen and heard and understood. I want my brand to feel very approachable. So when someone interacts with me, they feel like they know me. Those are very intentional things that I bring to my business and I bring to my brand because that's the reputation I wanna build. I want people to feel like I'm kinda like your online BFF.

Melanie Lea [00:14:49]:
That's that's how I want people to feel. So that's what I wanna be known for is that I'm easy to talk to and and be around and hear from and there's just like a comfort level to my brand. That's what I want for people. I would want others to describe me as funny, positive, vibrant. That's a big one. I want people to feel like I'm just full of life and energy, and I want people to kinda get some of that from me. I want them to be able to use some of that energy and apply it to their own business. And I'm hoping that this is how you guys feel too.

Melanie Lea [00:15:22]:
I hope you feel energized to work on your brand. That's very intentional. Everything I do, I'm coming to it with this sense of I need to give people energy so that they can feel more empowered and excited about what they're doing and more capable of doing what they're trying to with design. So that's just kind of a little behind the scenes. This is something that I'm very intentional about and it's the energy that I bring to my business and my brand. It's not about the colors. It's not about the fonts. It's how I'm talking to you.

Melanie Lea [00:15:50]:
It's how I'm presenting this information. It's how I'm coming to the party. So think of these things for your own brand. What do you wanna be known for? How do you want others to describe you? And how do you wanna make someone feel? All of these things are gonna be the most important aspect for building out your reputation and therefore your brand. Once we get these figured out, we're gonna be able to move to the colors and the messaging and the fonts and all of that stuff. But for now, think of these, write these down on the worksheet, really, really get clear on the feelings that you want someone to have and the reputation that you wanna build. Then we can do a really fun exercise. So this is something that will guide everything else that we're doing so concretely.

Melanie Lea [00:16:32]:
You're gonna have a list of brand buzzwords that everything else gets filtered through and is gonna help you have so much clarity in what you're doing. We're gonna create a list of words that pretty much sum up what your brand is all about. So go to your worksheet. And what I want you to do is I want you to think of, things that you want your audience to feel or think about you. So you can go to some of the answers that you've already written and look for words that keep popping up. So for me, mine would be empowered, optimism, vibrancy. I want you to think of what it is that your audience going to think or feel about you, and I want you to list out all of those words here. And something that I love to do is come up with, like, 20 at one time.

Melanie Lea [00:17:22]:
You're not gonna have enough time to right now, so just get the beginning, buzzwords listed out, and then you can build off of it after this workshop. But write out, like, 20 things. Make that your goal. Just to brain dump a bunch of things that you want people to feel or think about you. You can also write words and qualities that are are important to you as a person, as the individual behind your brand or your blog. So go ahead and list off those things. For me, it could be, community, optimism, innovation, vibrancy, energy, family, creativity. Just kinda thinking of things that are really important to me and my audience off of the the top of my head here.

Melanie Lea [00:18:02]:
So I want you to brain dump all of that in the first space in the worksheet. And then what I want you to do is I want you to spend some time really thinking about the 3 most important ones, and I want you to write those in the 3 spaces below that. So you might have some things that are kind of redundant. Like earlier, I mentioned innovation and I mentioned creativity. Those are kinda similar. So maybe I knock out creativity and innovation would be my main buzz buzzword. Maybe I wrote family and community, but for my business, maybe community is what's actually more important than family. So that would go out below.

Melanie Lea [00:18:41]:
It kind of forces you to get clear on what it is that you wanna represent. Like, all of these things that you've written down feel important. They feel like they're a part of you, but I'm I'm wanting you to kind of prioritize things. What are the most important ones? So write out all of your brain your buzzwords, brain dump those, try to get at least 20. And then I want you to spend some time prioritizing what is the most important and putting the 3 most important ones in the section below that. So after we get your brand buzzwords figured out, next I want you to get really really clear on your audience. Now this is an important part of the equation because your audience determines how your visuals will be executed. So let's go over an example.

Melanie Lea [00:19:27]:
I hope this helps it make more sense. Let's say that part of your brand personality is being cute. Well, let's take a look at all of these different examples of how you could personify cute. We've got pink. We've got sparkly. We've got this feminine, kind of photo in the top left. We've got a cute little dog. We've got florals.

Melanie Lea [00:19:47]:
We've got, bright feminine pastries. We've got little baby elements with the doll and the duckies. We've got a teacup and some figurines that a grandma might think cute. There are so many different ways that you could take one buzzword, and this is just one example of that, using the word cute. And depending on who you're trying to market to or who you're trying to attract to your brand, you might wanna execute that in a totally different way. So it's really, really important to get clear on your audience. So next, I want you to think, who is your audience? So going back to the worksheet, I want you to write out the age range of your audience. And this can be very very specific, very narrow, or it can be a broad age range.

Melanie Lea [00:20:31]:
So for me and my course students, I've had people enroll who are as young as 18 and as old as in their mid fifties or mid sixties. So it's okay if it's broad, but think about who these people are and what their age is. Next, I want you to think about their gender Are they male, female, non binary? You can write that out here Then we start to get into more specific things. So the next thing you can think about is where are they at in their life or business? If they are young adults, are they single young adults? Are they starting families? Do they already have a few kids? If they're in college, you can write that. Like, what are the things that they're juggling? What are the things that they care about? So think about what stage in life life or business that your person is in, and then I want you to start thinking about how you can kinda connect with them on a deeper level. If you can think about their hobbies or their interests, it's gonna help you, as you're, like, talking to them, they're gonna feel seen and heard. They're gonna think this person really gets me. They understand what I care about.

Melanie Lea [00:21:39]:
So that's why we write out what their hobbies and interests are. Do they like working out? Do they love hanging out by the pool? Are they into crafting? Are they multi passionate people with lots of hobbies and interests? Really, really think about that because that's gonna kinda help you understand quirks about them and help them feel seen and heard whenever you're talking because you're gonna be able to weave these, like, interests into what you're doing in your messaging. And it's going to help people go, wow this person really gets me, the next think you can think about is, where do they buy clothes? I like thinking about these kinds of questions because it helps me understand, the taste level and priorities of people. So if someone's buying something from J. Crew, that's gonna be a lot different from someone who's buying clothes from Kmart or Walmart. Nothing is wrong or right. It's just honing in on the individual that you're trying to attract to your brand. And it's gonna help you understand, their budgets and where they're at in life and the things that they're interested in in a deeper, kind of more specific way.

Melanie Lea [00:22:48]:
So I like asking this question because it can be really, really helpful for just understanding the priorities and the way that your person thinks. So other questions like that are what publications do they read, where do they buy groceries, what social media do they use, and how are they using each one. So publications, that's gonna help you understand how you can develop your writing style. So are they reading the New York Times, or are they reading Cosmopolitan Magazine? Are they reading Refinery 29, or are they going to, Buzzfeed? So think about what publications they're reading, what kind of tone are they used to hearing from those, and that can help you figure out how you can develop your tone and your messaging later on. So groceries, that's kinda the same thing with where do they buy clothes. Are they buying groceries from Whole Foods or Walmart? Or both. You know, it could be both. Figuring out these quest the answers to these questions are just gonna help you get to know your person on a deeper level.

Melanie Lea [00:23:53]:
Now here's a really important thing. What social media are they using? This is gonna help you figure out where you need to show up as a brand. Where do you need to be so that you can be seen? So figure out what social media they're using, and then how are they using each one? So if they are hanging out on Pinterest, what are they using it for? How are they using it? Are they trying to find recipes? Are they trying to buy products? Are they trying to get inspired? Are they researching? Are they on Facebook? If they're on Facebook, how are they using it? Are they in Facebook Groups? Are they they are just sharing personal stuff and they don't they don't do groups at all? Do they talk a lot through Messenger? Is that something that you need to incorporate into your marketing strategy? So think about what social media your people are on, and then how are they using it. And you can figure these things out by talking to them. So figure out who it is that you kinda wanna wanna be attracting. This might be someone that's already in your audience or someone that you know, and you can interview them, and you can ask them these questions. So after you figure out your audience, it's time to form a plan. We are gonna turn the foundational work that you've built into a plan.

Melanie Lea [00:25:05]:
This is where it's gonna get really, really real. The first thing that we can do is we can develop your messaging and tone. So think about how are you gonna be talk about your offerings, or how are you gonna talk about your blog or your brand? How will you talk about your projects and customers or your audience? What if someone has an issue with you? What kind of vibe are you gonna bring to the table when you're dealing with that? We can't just think about the positive things. We need to think about real life situations. If someone has a mean comment about content that you created, how are you gonna respond to them? This is part of your messaging. You can also think about what if you mess up on something and you're in the wrong. Say that you have a brand collaboration that you, like, mess up on something, you forgot to promote it in the very specific way that you agreed to. You maybe you messed up on something.

Melanie Lea [00:25:57]:
How are you gonna come to the table and fix it? What energy are you gonna bring to it that keeps you in line with what your brand is all about? So think about these things in your worksheet and write them out. After you've got a good idea of how you want your messaging and tone to be built out, we can develop your visual guidelines. So this is where most people go to in their minds whenever they think about branding is the visual guidelines. So now after we've done all of this prep work, we can finally dig into this. And I've got a lot of really good resources that are gonna help you flesh this out after this workshop. So let's kinda go over those. The first thing that I want you to think about is developing your color guidelines. Your brand's color scheme should play into the emotions that you want your target customer to associate with your brand.

Melanie Lea [00:26:49]:
So the big things that we wanna focus on right now are the emotions that you want your brand to give to your target audience. So I want you to go back to the work sheet, and I want you to think of those brand buzzwords. I want you to think about the audience that you are specifically trying to target through your Blogger, and come up with colors that are going to personify those things. So let's go over some quick stats about color and why this is so important to get really bright and to spend some good time thinking about. It takes point 5 seconds to halt someone's attention on a shelf or a display, and this does translate to being online also. Obviously, your blog is not gonna be on a shelf, but you can see it does not take much at all to to grab somebody's attention. 80% of what we assimilate through our senses is visual, which is also why color is so important. That is such a quick indicator.

Melanie Lea [00:27:50]:
It helps us just kinda process things quickly because we all have these preconceived thoughts and judgments around color. 90% of people feel that color can assist in attracting in attracting new customers. 90 seconds is how long it takes to make a subconscious decision about a person or a product. 62 to 90% of people think that their judgment is influenced by color alone. And 85% of consumers feel that color is the primary factor when choosing a product. Color increases brand recognition by 80%. This is why we're kinda starting with color when we're building out our brand plan. Because as you can see from all of these stats, getting your colors correct in your brand is gonna be really important for attracting the right people, stopping them in their tracks, and making them go, oh, I need to pay attention to this.

Melanie Lea [00:28:48]:
This is something that resonates with me. So that's why we kinda needed to do the work on the front end first. Once you understand who your customer is and what they wanna see, it's gonna be so much easier to create colors and fonts and all of the visual stuff that is gonna be attractive to them and help them relate to your brand and your blog. So this was research conducted by Colorcom. So you can go to colorcom.com/research/whycolormatters if you want to learn more stats and nerd out over this. Different colors are gonna have different emotional connections inherently tied to them. Here are some of the common conceptions. Red, people tend to associate that with being bold, passionate.

Melanie Lea [00:29:32]:
They associate it with love, strength, urgency, action, impulsivity, orange. People tend to associate that with happiness, friendliness, being an affordable option. So like Home Depot, their brand color is orange. You think of Home Depot and you think this is gonna be a more budget friendly option. People also associate warmth, cheeriness, energy. All of these things can be associated with the color orange. For yellow, that can be optimism, warmth, playfulness, creativity, youthfulness, confidence. Black can be associated with luxury, control, authority, edginess, mystery.

Melanie Lea [00:30:11]:
It can feel more formal. It can feel more sophisticated. Brown, that could be more security, wealth, help you feel more down to earth. It can give this sense of duty or comfort or protection. Green tends to be associated with freshness, health, luck, wealth, nature. It can be very relaxing. Blue can actually also be very relaxing too. People tend to associate that with being conservative or honest, secure, calm, trusting, productive.

Melanie Lea [00:30:41]:
Violet, imagination, royalty, creativity. Purple or violet can fill upscale. It can feel calming. It can help you feel more successful. And then white, people tend to associate that color with, being cool, complete, clean, innocent, maybe growth, maybe it gives this feeling of freshness, purity, openness. It depends on what type of tone or shade you use within these. Like, a dark royal blue is going to feel conservative, but obviously, this bright punchy blue does not feel conservative at all. This one has more energy to it.

Melanie Lea [00:31:20]:
It's a brighter, more saturated blue. So your tones and your shades really, really matter, which is why I've left a link for you to my blog post about colors, and how to create a color system for your business. So I've got this ultimate guide to creating a color system for your website, and it goes into a lot of information about color theory. It's gonna help you kinda come up with your color scheme here. For the most part, right now, I just want you to be thinking about those emotional connections, but come here so that you can learn a little bit more about color and get into, more information that's gonna help you come up with colors for your brand. So in your worksheet, what I want you to do is just Right off the bat, what are some colors that you think would work for your brand? For me, I want to feel empowering. I want to feel vibrant. I want to feel cheerful.

Melanie Lea [00:32:16]:
So I use a lot of coral, which is like a mix between red and orange. I have this kind of purply magenta color that I use. I also use a lot of white. I want there to be a lot of white space. So just go ahead and write out, I don't know, 1 to 3 or 4 colors that you think would make a good fit for your brand, and then you can research it after the training. Then once you have your colors kinda set out, I wanna show you how you can create a simple color system using these colors. So most people go, great. These are the colors that I want for my brand, but what am I supposed to do with this? So I've created a rule.

Melanie Lea [00:32:54]:
It's called the 60, 30, 10 rule, where you take your colors and you create a system for them. So you are gonna pick 1 to 2 dominant colors, and you're gonna use these 60% of the time. Then you can think of 1 to 2 secondary colors, and you will use these 30% of the time. So half the amount of time that you use the dominant colors. And then you can think of 1 to 2 accent colors that you use very, very sparingly, 10% of the time. So maybe you have 1 or 2 accent colors, and you use these on your blog for your buttons, so that they really, really stand out. So that as someone's scrolling through a blog page or any page on your website, those buttons are gonna stand out from everything else on the page and help someone take action with you. It's gonna be an accent color.

Melanie Lea [00:33:44]:
Like I said, go to that blog post. It's gonna give you examples and help you make a lot more sense of this information. Unfortunately, we've got we got so much time during this presentation, but I wanna give you stuff that you can really sink your teeth into and learn more about at your own pace afterwards. So after we think of your color guidelines, we can think of your font guidelines next. So let's go into some common font families. There are 3 that we're gonna talk about. The first one is serifs. So you can see from here, these have the little notches on the end.

Melanie Lea [00:34:20]:
Serifs tend to be associated with, classic brands. They feel more upscale sometimes. They can form more premium. They can also feel more traditional. So serifs have the little notches on them. Then there are sans serifs. So these don't have the notches. They tend to feel more minimal and clean and simple.

Melanie Lea [00:34:44]:
People use these a lot for, like, tech or for modern brands. And then there are scripts. These are gonna be like your handwritten or cursive fonts. So I want you to think about what you want your brand to feel like. Do you want it to feel more classic? Do you want it to feel high end? Do you want it to feel more modern? Do you want to have this handwritten effect that feels, more elegant or more down to earth? There's so many variations with the script font family that they can feel tons of different ways depending on the script that you that you pick, and actually that's true for all of the font families. So I've got a blog post that gives you different font pairings. I focus on serif and sans serif fonts. My personal opinion is that script fonts can fill dated very, very fast.

Melanie Lea [00:35:36]:
People tend to get tired of looking at the same script font after a certain amount of years. So I personally like to focus on using serif and sans serif fonts because they're more classic and timeless, and you don't tend to get tired of looking at them. That is just my personal opinion. You need to live your life and do what feels right for you. But do go to that blog post that is in your worksheet because that's gonna give you examples of font pairings that you can use in your brand, and it's gonna tell you a little bit more about how to pick them for yourself. Then what I want you to do is I want you to write out what types of font families are you going to use for your brand. So pick serif, sans serif, Right. You can mix and match them.

Melanie Lea [00:36:20]:
Just pick 1 to 2 types of families, and then you can go to websites like dafonts.com or fontsquirrel.com or Google fonts. And you can search for these specific font families. So you can say, I wanna look at serifs, and you just look through all of the serifs, and you figure out which one feels good for you. You can say, I'm gonna look at sans serif fonts, and just look at that font family and find fonts that feel good for you. And like I said, I do have a blog post that that gives you font pairings that are all free. They all use Google Fonts. So that's a free way to get fonts. So for right now, just pick, what do I want? Serif, sans serif, or script.

Melanie Lea [00:36:59]:
You can pick 1 or 2. Write that down in your work sheet, and then we are gonna talk about how to create a system using your fonts. So something that you can do is you can look at this basic paragraph structure. So what we see on lots of websites or blogs is a subheading, a headline, your body text, and then a call to action. So I don't know if you guys have ever noticed this, but this pops up everywhere online. You kinda got this basic structure. What we can do is we can plug fonts into these, different elements that you use consistently. It's a system.

Melanie Lea [00:37:36]:
So you can say, I wanna use this one specific font for my subheading, one for my headline, one for my body text, and then one for my call to action. So there's the basic structure and then the sample structure kinda shows you what it might look like on an actual website. The next thing I wanna talk about is hierarchy. The first example all the way to the left. This is no hierarchy. This is just using the exact same font. You use it for your head, your subheading, your headline, your body text, your call to action, it all kind of gets lost. Your your eye doesn't go to anything specific because it all looks the same.

Melanie Lea [00:38:11]:
Now, you go to this middle example, and we've started to shake things up a little bit. So we've got our subheading. It's all caps. It's kind of italicized, so it looks a little bit different. The headline where it says brand identity package, that's a larger font. It's thicker. It's in all caps. It stands out a little bit.

Melanie Lea [00:38:30]:
Our body text, it's a little bit smaller. You definitely don't go to that first. You're going to the headlines first. So that's kind of what you want to happen. You want that to be something that people go to maybe 2nd or 3rd. You want them to read the headlines first. And then the get the deets, the call to action, that's also been stylized. It's all caps, so it stands out a little bit, but we can make this stronger.

Melanie Lea [00:38:53]:
We can also use color to, create awesome hierarchy. So we can take those colors that we created in our color system earlier and plug them into your font system so that they become more effective and draw people to the right parts that you want them to see. So you can see in the awesome hierarchy, we've added color to the headline, so now it stands out a lot more. And then we've also added color to the call to action. We've created a button that is also this kind of, like, brighter color so it stands out. So I just wanted to show you a quick example of how you can use fonts and color to create hierarchy and help people digest information on your blog or your website or even on your social media. So if all of this is confusing, make sure to go to that blog post that I've linked up to in the worksheet. It's gonna help you work through this a little bit more and give you some more information and context.

Melanie Lea [00:39:46]:
So what I want you to do in your worksheet is I want you to think about what fonts you can use for your subheading, for your headline, for your body text, and for your call to action. I've got some links for you in the worksheet. That's gonna help you come up with what your actual fonts are. And then once you have those fonts picked out, I want you to plug them into a system and then I want you to use those consistently to build out brand consistency for yourself. The next thing we're gonna go over is outlining your photography style. There are those brand buzzwords that we created earlier. What you can do is you can get really, really focused on what those brand buzzwords are and then research photography styles that relate to them. So you can see here I've got some examples.

Melanie Lea [00:40:32]:
There's pretty, fun, bold, nostalgic, moody, minimal, editorial, calm. Your photo editing style is going to influence the feel of it. So you can see here in the bold, we've got these bright saturated colors. There's lots of contrast with the moody. There's a lot of darker tones. It's black and white which I think lends itself really well to moodiness. With minimal, you can see there's not a lot of crazy colors going on. It's black and white with this pop of green.

Melanie Lea [00:41:06]:
With calm, we've got these more subdued kind of desaturated tones. Same same thing for where it says nostalgic. Those are not bright punchy colors. We're using very calming muted tones. So you can think of your brand buzzwords and then start searching out photography styles that align with those words. In the worksheet, I've got some kinda starter words that might help you kinda hone in on what your brand's photography style is. Highlight the ones that resonate most with you, or there's space for you to write your own. What I want you to do is I want you to highlight or make bigger the 3 or so that really, really call out to you that you say, I want these things to personify my photography style.

Melanie Lea [00:41:50]:
And then you can go to a site like Pinterest, and you can search out photos that have that similar style. And you can create a board, and you can see how all of these things that are filtered through your brand buzzwords, how do they look together? And what types of photography, styles could you use in your business? You could then recreate photos. You could take photos yourself and buy filters that, help you edit them in the style that you want. You can hire a photographer and say, great. Here's my my Pinterest board that I created. This is the style that I'm going for, and give it to them. And then they can create photos for you that have that same style. But that'll give you a good place to start.

Melanie Lea [00:42:31]:
So go to the blog post that I've linked up to in the worksheet, and that's gonna give you some more information with this step. And it's really gonna help tie everything together because, remember, people use visuals to process information, and having a photography style that is really, really specific to the brand personality that you wanna convey is gonna help people know very, very quickly if they are in the right place or not, if they are gonna connect to what you're saying and what you're all about. So spend some good time figuring out your brand photography style. Now the last thing I wanna talk about after we've got all of these elements kinda figured out, after we've built your your foundation, your brand plan, after we've thought about your colors and your fonts and your photography, building consistency into your brand is going to be really, really important. So I've got some tips for you. The first one is to stick to your color, font, photography, and messaging guidelines. I want you to do the work and think about it now so that you don't have to think about it later. You don't have to switch things up.

Melanie Lea [00:43:34]:
You've already done the work. You know that your colors and your fonts and your messaging, it's in line with your brand. Now you just need to stick to it. So that's really, really important. I also want you to create a list of words that you use in normal conversation with friends and family. Oftentimes, we can have a disconnect between our personal lives and our brands because we think we need to sound more professional, or we can kinda get tripped up with the bigness of the Internet, and so we can get self conscious about ourselves and we think, oh my God, I don't know what to say or I sound stupid. So what I like to do is I like to think of words and phrases that I use in my real life with my friends and with my family and with my real life interactions. I call these Melanie isms.

Melanie Lea [00:44:21]:
It helps me whenever I'm creating social media content or blog posts or if I'm writing a script for a video. I have these list of words that I can make sure are sprinkled throughout whatever I'm writing or saying that it's gonna build consistency over time. Like, something that I say, quite often is boom. So I'll say, like, oh my god. I just dominated this steak dinner. Boom. Or if I'm doing, like, a a tutorial, I'll say, here's step 1. Here's step 2.

Melanie Lea [00:44:53]:
Here's step 3. Boom, you got your finished product. So that's just a tiny little thing that is so me in real life that I can infuse into my online personality. So that over time, as people kind of, see content from me, over time, they they start to just feel like they know me. I'm an infusing personality, and And it helps me show up more consistently because I'm tuning into myself and how I act and sound in real life, and it just kinda helps me bring more focus to what I'm saying for my brand and my business. And then, also, stick to your values and your brand personality. So we did all of that work coming up with what you wanna be known for, and what your vision and your goals are, and your brand buzzwords, and how you wanna sound. Stick to those.

Melanie Lea [00:45:41]:
Come up with 3 brand buzzwords, and filter everything you do through those three things that you said are most important to personify what your brand is all about. Stick to those so that as you show up, it's easier. For me, I want to be optimistic. I wanna be energetic, and I wanna be empowering. So whenever I'm coming up with content or going to a networking event or hopping on a call with someone, I wanna personify those three things always, a 100% of the time. If there's an issue or I did something wrong, I still wanna stick to those three values. I still wanna show up, optimistically. I still wanna show up with good energy.

Melanie Lea [00:46:25]:
So stick to those values, and you're going to see consistency in your brand over time. So that's it for today. I hope that this training and the worksheet and all of the blog posts that I've left for you are helpful. Be sure to check out the brand personality quiz. That's gonna help you make a lot more sense of all the ideas swimming around in your head. It's gonna help you reach a little bit more clarity. So thank you so much. I hope this was helpful for you, and I really, really appreciate your time today.

Melanie Lea [00:46:53]:
If you want to reach out to me on Instagram, I'm at my billie designs. Billie is billie. I would love to know what your colors are, what your fonts are, or what you think about this training.

Liz Stapleton [00:47:06]:
Okay. That was fantastic. I have a long list of things to do now.

Melanie Lea [00:47:12]:
May think. Good. That's always but not that I want to give people a lot of stuff to do, but I want this to be really, really actionable and for you to get a lot out of this. So that's amazing to hear. Thank you.

Liz Stapleton [00:47:21]:
Well, the idea is to like, if you do this right first well, not first time, but after this, you shouldn't have to really do much going forward. So it's kinda one and done. It's not like a repeat. But we have system sessions that will help you guys figure out the stuff that's repeatable, that you have to do. But I know you have a great free offer for for the attendees. Can you tell us a little bit about it?

Melanie Lea [00:47:42]:
Yeah. So if you haven't taken it yet, I created this brand personality quiz and that's something that you can sign up for. It's just I think like 6 questions and it helps you get started with what we talked about today. Like, I I feel like we can tend to have a lot of ideas, and it's hard to make sense of it. And so this is something that will kinda do an assessment for you and help you figure out that starting point for what your brand personality is. And then if you want the emails that come with it, then I'll help you work that into like your, your brand personality, like your voice and tone and your messaging and, and getting in touch with how you can use this information to actually grow your brand instead of just like figure out what colors you like and how your personality feels to you. Like I want this to be actionable and, for you to be able to kinda create and grow from it. So, yeah, the brand personality quizzes is awesome.

Melanie Lea [00:48:37]:
I definitely recommend you guys do that if you're wanting to take this a little bit further.

Liz Stapleton [00:48:41]:
Yeah. So it kinda sounds like a little bit more hand holding on some of the content you learned today. So if you are, like, overwhelmed with all the stuff you learned, which hope hopefully I mean, we've got some really clear steps that I'm excited about. But, you know, if you want just a little more hand holding, definitely go take that quiz. It'll help you a lot. Yeah. Melanie is amazing, so definitely go check her check out her site and content. You're sure to sure to learn even more.

Liz Stapleton [00:49:07]:
Melanie, thank you again so much for being present. I really appreciate it.

Melanie Lea [00:49:10]:
Thank you guys so much. Thank you, Liz. It's been a lot of fun, and I hope you have a wonderful day.
