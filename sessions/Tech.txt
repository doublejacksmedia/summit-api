[00:00:03.200] - Liz Stapleton, Host
All right guys, I'm super excited for this session because I think it is just so important. Very warm welcome to Bev Feldman, who is a ConvertKit consultant and email automation strategist who believes in bringing in and treating your subscribers with trust and respect. Thank you so much for joining us, Bev. Welcome.

[00:00:30.340] - Bev Feldman
Thanks. Excited to be here.

[00:00:34.170] - Liz
Yeah, so we're going to be talking about email automations, which are basically the magic sauce of email marketing, but can become overwhelming and disorganized super-fast. So let's maybe start, and I think we're going to just tailor this conversation in terms of ConvertKit, not that it doesn't apply, but as far as the language we're going to use. Let's start by digging in. Can you explain some of the different kinds of automations you can use and why they're important, why you should be using them?

[00:01:08.790] - Bev
Yeah, I think people watching this might know on a very basic level, having some sort of welcome sequence that when people sign up for your email list, they automatically get welcomed into your world. And to me I think that's really important, because people when they sign up for your email list, they're excited. That is the best time to get them engaged. You know that regardless of what you have going on in your life, that at the very least, new subscribers will be automatically welcomed into your world and you'll help them to decide if this is a good fit.

[00:01:44.910] - Liz
Yes, and then that's the simplest I think, automation. And then from there it can get more complicated.

[00:01:52.420] - Bev
Oh, yes, it can.

[00:01:54.640] - Liz
So with rules and tagging and all this stuff, let's talk about — because one of the things I really hesitated to do for a long time was to delete an outdated automation. What are your thoughts in terms of — because we're going to dig more into organizing and best practices. What are your thoughts on cleaning out automations and how often should you do it? What should that look like? Should you not do it?

[00:02:22.250] - Bev
Yeah, well, so I'm of the opinion that at the very least if you have some way to keep things organized, I think about with ConvertKit at least, you're limited in how you can organize things. I, for myself, have done this thing. If there's an automation that I'm like, well I don't want to get rid of it completely I'll put a Z or something. That way when it's listed alphabetically, it's at the bottom. It's out of the way, and I'm not scrolling through trying to find what I need. But in terms of thinking about, should I delete this automation or not? My suggestion would be is to, before you do that to actually look at that automation and see what brings people into that automation and what that automation might trigger. Because I've seen instances where people are like, well, I don't need this thing. Actually, you deleted a very important step. We want to be really mindful, and that's why I always recommend, regardless of you're doing, testing out things. Before you put anything new into the world, you want to make sure everything is working the way you want it to. The other thing I'll note about that is that I've seen people say, when you're looking at tags saying, oh, I don't need these tags, I'm just going to delete a bunch. Then you go look at your automation and suddenly you have null, you're like, shoot, I just deleted something that I might have possibly needed, but now I don't know because it just shows up as basically a blank. I always recommend when it comes to things like tags, and I do think it's good practice to clean up those as well just because it can get unwieldy very quickly, is to check where those tags are being used. So looking at your automations, looking at your rules, and making sure before you delete anything that it is not being tied to something else.

[00:04:23.570] - Liz
Yes, and I have hundreds of tags, I swear. It's crazy.

[00:04:29.840] - Bev
Yeah. Oh, and fun fact, ConvertKit now actually limits it to 100 for newer. So I don't know when they made that switch.

[00:04:36.650] - Liz
Oh my gosh, I'd be screwed!

[00:04:39.480] - Bev
Well, I think I've seen people who had very, very long lists. It would take a very long time to load. And I think maybe they actually did fix that, so it wasn't taking such a long time. But yeah, I think it forces people who are newer to using ConvertKit to be really mindful about what information they're tracking.

[00:04:58.670] - Liz
Yeah. Wow. I didn't know that. I can't imagine. Well, part of the reason I have so many is because I am housing two different sites in one ConvertKit account because the audiences overlap a lot. So it just makes sense. I used to have three and didn't overlap, and that was even messier. Okay, so how would you suggest people get started in trying to clean up and organize their ConvertKit account? And I'm happy to share my screen if that's going to be helpful for you to point things out, so I can blur personal information and stuff.

[00:05:42.160] - Bev
It's totally up to you. So, what I've done for some clients is created — I'm going to just preface this by saying it's very tedious because there's no good way to export your list of tags besides doing it manually, is create a spreadsheet basically of what information you have. I'll say that this — I don't necessarily think everyone needs to do this. If you have a very simple, straightforward setup in your backend where it's basically someone signs up for your freebie and they go into a welcome sequence and that's it, then I don't think you need to keep it. You don't necessarily need to do this. But for those of us who have more complex things going on in the backend, having a spreadsheet where you're tracking basically every single tag that you've gotten there and what rules and automations those links trigger, and also where else those are being used. I've done this for my clients so that they could have a full picture of what things are using, and then it enables us to say, okay, well, it looks like this tag, for example, has maybe two people. It's not in any rules or automations. Maybe we can consider deleting it and maybe taking this information, do you actually need it? Can we combine it with something else versus some tags, like we talked about, might be tied to a lot of rules and automations, and you want to be really careful before you get rid of that. I would start with that before you're going to clean anything up, is to just check and see where they are connected. Actually, I have a fun little trick for this. So, if you're on ConvertKit and you go to your visual automations page, and I think depending if you're your Mac or Windows, I'm a Mac user so I know if I do, I'm looking at my keyboard, it's Command-F. I will type in the name of that tag, and then it highlights all the instances where that tag is being used. So I can look and see. Oh, okay. I can either say, Oh, this rule is not being used anywhere. Oh, this tag is being used in these automations. Same thing with rules, like going into your rules page, doing a Control-F, seeing where those tags are being used in your list of rules as well.

[00:08:15.850] - Liz
Let's give some visual aspect to this. So, this is like rules and I can see how doing Control-Find or Command- F for us Mac users would be super easy here. Are you saying that works in automations also?

[00:08:35.130] - Bev
Yeah, do the same thing.

[00:08:37.120] - Liz
So if I go to my visual automations?

[00:08:40.270] - Bev
Yep. Oh, you know what? In this case, because I have it set up — Yeah, if you have it set up like that, you can actually see what's in them.

[00:08:55.670] - Liz
Okay. So if I did —  Oh, it means I need to know one of my tags. Well, I could just do that. Right. So the BBS welcome.  No, that's interesting. Oh, I know what I can do. BBS. Okay, so it'll search through the names of the automations, but not necessarily the tags in it, is that...?

[00:09:29.640] - Bev
It should. You have to have the exact tag name. But when I've done it, it has pulled up. So for example, you see how that...

[00:09:38.010] - Liz
Oh yeah, no you're right. It's highlighting right here. You're totally right. I just can't type.

[00:09:42.800] - Bev
It's very subtle.

[00:09:44.000] - Liz
It is.

[00:09:45.720] - Bev
Yeah, but then you can see that tag GDPR, or that might not necessarily just be a tag, but you'll see it's in there.

[00:09:53.530] - Liz
Yeah, it's a sequence in that instance, but same idea, right? Okay, that was just because I was like, I know this isn't the name of it — need to think about the term. Okay, so I learn something new, and I'm betting it doesn't do it. Okay, does it still do it?

[00:10:12.380] - Bev
I don't know. It's funny. I never put my ConvertKit, I'd never looked at ConvertKit in that view. It's always the like —I forgot you could even have that option because I never think to do it.

[00:10:24.480] - Liz
Yeah. And you can see. So a few years ago, I did an hour call with an email strategist, similar to what you do. And you can see some of my stuff is actually named really well.

[00:10:37.650] - Bev
Oh, yeah. I was going to comment on that. I was going to give you — I've noticed that.

[00:10:45.600] - Liz
I mean, that's not always been the case. So here's my tags. Some of them. So you get down, so you've got all the one site and then the other site, and then you get down to not nearly as well named. I learned that doing the date in 'Flash Sale' doesn't really help me, so I stopped naming them that way.

[00:11:08.710] - Bev
So, this is an instance where I'd say, well, do you need that information still?

[00:11:13.270] - Liz
Probably not. Probably not the really poorly named ones. Or I need to go back and look at them and rename them. But yeah, you can see I have tons and tons of tags.

[00:11:23.790] - Bev
And sometimes there's instances, especially for people like you who are running summits, and during the summit, you need to get granular about the information. But when the summit's over, there's a lot of information that you might not need to know. Obviously, you want to know who attended, who did the paid thing, the paid version of things.

[00:11:46.970] - Liz
But who clicked on this particular link on this particular day that leads to an offer that's no longer available, maybe less so.

[00:11:56.340] - Bev
Yeah. And so this is one of those instances where I'd say — because what I do with clients is so tailored to their business, their business model, what they sell, how they sell. And this would be an instance where I'd say, well, we should create an SOP [a Standard Operating Procedure] that here's the list of things you do when the summit's over, including the things you can delete from your ConvertKit account, or combine once the event is over.

[00:12:22.190] - Liz
Are they archived? I think it will do. I know you can archive forms. I don't know if it lets you archive other things.

[00:12:27.450] - Bev
No, it doesn't. Unfortunately, the only option is to delete an automation.

[00:12:31.170] - Liz
Let me see, I cleaned out my list. I wish ConvertKit would let you organize things into folders and make life so much easier. But would you like to suggest a similar naming convention? Or is there something else you tend to recommend?

[00:13:02.730] - Bev
From what I can see, I feel like your naming convention, it would be something I'd recommend. How you have it set up is great. I think the naming conventions should always be something that makes sense to you as a business owner, so that when you look at it, you're like, okay, these are all for the Blogger Breakthrough Summit and you can see all that information right there, versus if it was just membership waitlist, that doesn't get as granular. It might not give you enough information.

[00:13:37.660] - Liz
Yeah, and then so you're saying, and I should really do this, I was through this. So if you want to put together a spreadsheet, you could have everything. An Airtable would be great for this, too. I could see if you're not super Google Sheet-savvy and list everything and then connect them, you can reference other things. Is that what you were talking about? Or do you do this differently?

[00:14:02.060] - Bev
No, I mean, this is pretty much what I would do. I would say what the tag is called, and then I'll put the links directly to any automations or rules that they're connected to. Certainly, there's other software out there that could probably allow you to map out that flow better than a Google spreadsheet would. But for the purposes of what I'm trying to help my clients with it, I don't think we need to get that fancy.

[00:14:29.840] - Liz
Yeah, you can end up in the weeds so quickly. I'm going to go ahead and stop sharing my screen. Because it does. It starts with the welcome sequence, and then you add an upsell, and then you add, oh, well, did they buy the tripwire right after they opted in? And so does that need to take them to a different welcome sequence? And need to do the product onboarding sequence? And do they want to go do those at the same time? How many emails are they going to be getting? It could spiral real quick.

[00:15:01.610] - Bev
Oh my gosh, yeah. And then suddenly you've got subscribers somehow going through eight different email sequences at once. And that's what we're trying to avoid. It's about finding that balance where the people in your email list are getting the things that they sign up for without also being inundated with a bazillion emails from you, especially if they're new to your world and then they're going to be more likely to unsubscribe because you're like, well, I did not sign up to get 20 emails from Liz today.

[00:15:27.880] - Liz
Yes. Okay, so how do you recommend people go in and try to figure out what is happening if they haven't managed to organize from the get-go? Which if that's you, just know that's most people, don't feel bad.

[00:15:45.000] - Bev
Exactly. So I actually have a five-step framework. It's five pillars, five email automation pillars. The first one happens to be organized, and that's all things like tags, tags and segments, and in the case of ConvertKit, also custom fields. If you're using another email marketing software, might be groups or lists. So start by going through that. That's the first step is like what tags are you using? Where could you be using them better? Which ones can you possibly get rid of? So, that would be the first step.

[00:16:20.960] - Bev
The next step is the next pillar, is the opt-in pillar, and that's looking at what's the flow when someone signs up for your email list. So, for example, when I'm testing things out for my clients, I will sign up for all the freebies that I can find so I can see what's going on as a subscriber, like what's actually happening? And then I can also track it in the backend of ConvertKit. And if I see if someone, for example, signs up for multiple freebies and I see that they're suddenly being pulled into a bunch of automations, that's something we want to look at.

[00:17:00.400] - Bev
And then the next step is, offer. So, this is then looking through what happens where you're giving opportunities to sell your things within your emails. For example, if someone signs up for your freebie, what happens next? When are you selling your things, basically?

[00:17:23.700] - Liz
I just want to add just a quick tip. If you have a gmail account, even if it's the one linked to your thing, you can do — for mine, it's like hello@elizabethstapleton.com. I do like hello plus test one.

[00:17:35.560] - Bev
Yes.

[00:17:36.210] - Liz
And I see what happens, and if it's not what I expect, I'm like, hello plus test2, test17, which I get up there when I'm doing summit stuff, guys, because I do a lot of testing and stuff still sometimes I don't catch it. Test1234. So that you know what you did to make it work, versus if it's not acting how you're expecting. So, that is such a useful tip to be able to test things.

[00:18:05.640] - Bev
Yeah, and that's exactly what I do when I sign up for my clients opt-ins. I'll have one, I'll use a different email address for each opt-in so that in my inbox I can track to see what emails are coming to each one. I'll also use one email address where I sign up for all of them as well, because I want to check each thing individually, as well as what happens if I sign up for a bunch of things at once.

[00:18:29.510] - Liz
Yes. And then every once in a while I go in and I delete the amount of test emails I have in my ConvertKit account.

[00:18:36.090] - Bev
Yes, you definitely want to do that.

[00:18:37.510] - Liz
It should be a lot. But it's great because then you can do things like if you want to send a broadcast and no one's in that been tagged with who you want to send it to yet because it's a different broadcast, I always just be like that one and I have a segment of test. So there's always something in there. So that's just quick little tip there. Okay, so I'll let you get back to once you go through testing what your next pillar is.

[00:19:07.990] - Bev
Yeah. So the offers, I was on the offer, that one is actually less related to automations and cleaning things up, but the next one is the onboard automation. So what happens if someone actually buys something? Are people, are subscribers being tagged properly to identify that they purchased that thing? If they're in an automation that's promoting it, are they being pulled out of that automation? So, it's basically making sure they get the information they need, as well as being pulled out of anything else that wouldn't make sense at that point. And then I'll also add in this step, that your emails might not actually necessarily be coming through ConvertKit. I've worked with clients who use Kajabi and ConvertKit. Sometimes our onboarding emails happen through Kajabi, or maybe the example of someone booking a call, your emails, those emails might be coming through Acuity or Calendly. As long as that there's some way that you're onboarding your clients, or people who book calls and that they're being identified within ConvertKit, those are the two most important things.

[00:20:15.410] - Bev
And then the last step is actually the last pillar, is optimize. So that's next level, right? You've cleaned everything up. Where are opportunities to really improve on the things that you already have set up? To give a really concrete example, I was working with a client to do an email automation audit, and she had really great engagement rates, really good open rates and her click-through rates were really high. And she came to me because she wanted to use her email to do more selling. But when I looked at her click-through rates and what she was at, what her subscribers are actually clicking on, I noticed people are clicking on the links to the free things, but not the link so much to book a call with you. So how can we make some adjustments there? So, really this step is really digging deeper into what you have. So it's less focus on cleaning things up, but more about optimizing what you already have set up.

[00:21:11.070] - Liz
Sure. Okay, so one thing I wanted to ask based on what you were saying earlier is how to best use tags, because a tag versus a form can both kick off an automation. And it would be great to be like, oh yeah, I'm just going to use forms because then tags are very specific set of information. But then you use tools that will let you apply it to a form or a tag, but not both. So any tips regarding what different ways to use tags to benefit your email marketing efforts?

[00:21:51.180] - Bev
Yeah, that's a great question. Well, first, one thing to keep in mind with ConvertKit is a form will only trigger an automation once. So if you have someone signing up for the same form more than once and you need them to get whatever follow-up emails every time they sign up, you actually would have to do it as a tag. And you would have to not only have the tag trigger it, you would have to have the tag removed immediately. I have tags that are more like admin tags that the whole purpose of them is just to move people through things. Usually, it's basically someone would be tagged and then immediately have that tag removed. So, if it's something like you need — if someone signs up for some opt-in on your website and you need them to get some follow-up emails, then you'll need to use a tag. If it's just they sign up for your freebie and then go down some welcome sequence, and they're only going to get the welcome sequence once at that point, it doesn't really—  it's personal preference on how you set it up. I think, I personally like to track all of the various freebies I have.

[00:23:05.460] - Bev
So even though I have a form for an opt-in, I like to have a tag just because sometimes there might be different ways people are signing up for the same thing. So theoretically, I could have two different forms that are for the same freebie. It's still helpful for me to see who has actually signed up for that freebie. Personally, I recommend having tags for those. I recommend having tags for things like 'interest' as it relates to you as a business owner. For an example, because I work with ConvertKit, business owners on ConvertKit, it's helpful for me to know when people sign up for my website, are you currently using ConvertKit? Do you use something else? Do you use nothing? Are you using something else and thinking about switching to ConvertKit? So that provides me really helpful information. I think having some interest-level tag is really important because it can allow you to better segment your audience later on.

[00:24:11.480] - Bev
And if you don't mind I would like to just talk about segmentation a little bit more and how it applies to deliverability. It's like my favorite. If we're working to grow our email list, it's important to make sure our emails are actually showing up in people's inboxes. So I think people talk a lot about segmentation, and they're like, yeah, segmentation is good. But a lot of times people like, well, what does that actually mean? So first of all, it means cleaning up your email list. And I know you said you just did that.

[00:24:43.610] - Liz
Well, I cleaned out cold subscribers.

[00:24:45.850] - Bev
Yes, exactly. Not just like deleting people willy-nilly. And I know sometimes it can feel like, oh, I work so hard to get these subscribers. Why would I want to delete them? But yeah.

[00:24:58.190] - Liz
I got over that a long time ago. But when you're first starting out, yes. Every unsubscribe hurts, and then actually actively getting rid of people can be hard. You will get past it. It's good for you.

[00:25:09.570] - Bev
Yeah, and you probably noticed your email engagement goes up right after you remove your cold subscribers or you try to re-engage them. So, the other piece to the segmentation is sending people relevant information to them. So for example, if I wanted to send an email to people who are interested in switching to ConvertKit, it'd be weird to email everyone on my list that because presumably a lot of those people already are on ConvertKit. So because I've collected this information at the beginning, I can send a more tailored email to those people, which will help with engagement, which will help with my emails overall showing up in people's inboxes.

[00:25:53.460] - Liz
Yeah. And I'm going to just share my screen real quick of the benefit of cleaning out your list, just very quickly. Guys, this is when I log in to ConvertKit. This is my account. 85% of my subscribers are five stars of engagement within the last 30 days. Which means I have almost 50% average open rate on anything I send. Some stuff is higher, but I feel like the lowest I ever get is 42%, maybe 40%. It's because a couple of times a year, I'll clean up my list.

[00:26:30.100] - Bev
I'm ruthless about doing it with my own email list. I do it way more than I think anyone necessarily needs to. 

[00:26:39.230] - Liz
And I've got re-engagement. I give them an option to stay here, but if you're not going to be doing anything, I'm not going to be paying for you to be on my list. It doesn't mean you have to buy, but if you're not even going to engage.

[00:26:55.520] - Bev
Exactly.

[00:26:57.520] - Liz
Yeah, sorry. I just wanted to be like, this is what it looks like when you regularly clean out your list.

[00:27:03.120] - Bev
Yeah. It's very important.

[00:27:05.700] - Liz
And other people have even better stats than I do, obviously, but I'm pretty happy that I can almost always count on at least 40% of people opening my email.

[00:27:15.710] - Bev
Yeah. Actually, since we're talking about stats, and I'd like to, and you probably know this, but just for anyone watching to point out that open rates, we have to take with a grain of salt. They're not super accurate. However, I like to look at open rates instead of looking at like, oh yeah, this is my open rates. Rather, I look at it in context. So if I look at my last 10 emails, for example, and my open rates tend to be in a range. If I saw an email that either had an exception that was higher than I normally see or lower, that would be a signal to me like, oh, this email had a really high open rate. What about it was so engaging? Or oh, this one really tanked and was way lower than my other emails. Like why? What could I have done differently? So while we can't take open rates without any — in that sense, like the other kind ...

[00:28:13.940] - Liz
But it's an average. The first email you send someone when they're expecting something from you is going to have a higher-than-average open rate, and then it all averages out. So, it's always understand — I was a math major so I know you can make stats work however, which way you want but just having a range that you expect, like I expect my open rate to show somewhere between 42% and 50% for an average broadcast, not counting sequences, not counting things like that. So just knowing where you're at and don't like, guys, if it's 30%, that's still good. Again, these aren't super accurate, like just making sure that you have some people opening your email is important. 

[00:29:02.120] - Bev
I think it's helpful to look and see not only who's opening it, but who's clicking on it? What are people clicking on? 

[00:29:12.300] - Liz
Okay, so back to segmentation. Sorry, I just wanted to — you talked about cleaning out your list. I'm like, look, guys, this is why you do it, is so that — because the higher engagement you have for your list, I think, is where you were headed, the better deliverability. 

[00:29:27.910] - Bev
Yes, and so we want to make sure that our emails that we worked really hard to write and the list that we've worked hard to grow, that those people are actually getting those emails and they're not ending up in people's spam folders. 

[00:29:42.310] - Liz
So I think we are running out of time, unfortunately. Anyway, so any final tips, any final words you want to make sure people know about keeping their email marketing service organized and working for them?

[00:29:59.720] - Bev
Yeah, I would say that maybe— I know it's not fun, and I'm sure there's other things you'd rather be working on in your business. But making a point either like I said, if you have an event coming up, making sure that part of the process afterwards that you are going and getting rid of the things you don't actually need anymore. And then on top of that, making a point periodically to really look through what's going on back there. See do I still need this automation? Or there are ones you turned off, can you get rid of those? What tags can you get rid of or combine? But again, not just willy-nilly. Just so that when you go inside, everything makes sense to you. Because that's the whole point, is that things are clear, they make sense to you, and you know that the right emails are going out to the right people, because when you start to make things really complicated, then that's where you can run into trouble.

[00:30:59.080] - Liz
Yeah, and just regularly review stuff just like you would. I always am like, every once in a while, at least once a quarter, go look at your site in the incognito window and you'll discover things. And same thing with your sequences. I have a recurring task to go review sequences. And I went, and I was like, oh, this will be a quick thing to check off my list. And for some reason, the first two emails have disappeared because glitches happened, or at some point it didn't save or whatever. And I was like, oh my God, how many people have been getting a blank email? Fortunately, it wasn't many. But I was like, oh, and I was like, where can I find the older version? Which ConvertKit support is super helpful. We got it there. But stuff happens, so go make sure things are continuing to work.

[00:31:41.700] - Bev
Yeah, and especially because your email list is one of your most important assets as a business owner, which is why I think it's important to invest the time in it. 

[00:31:50.950] - Liz
Okay, so where can people learn more about you? What do you have for them? What's, share all the things?

[00:31:56.530] - Bev
Yeah. So I have a free audio training called ""Fix Your Flow: Get the right emails to the right people."" I dive a little deeper into the five email automation pillars that we talked about. So you can download that. And because we have also talked a lot about tags, and I know people can get very confused and overwhelmed with tags versus segments. I have a guide that helps walk you through the process of what information do you need to know, what information don't you need, and if should it be a tag, a segment, or custom field?

[00:32:34.120] - Liz
That's awesome. Yeah, because custom fields I'm just learning. I've been on ConvertKit for years and years. I'm just really getting into custom fields.

[00:32:42.490] - Bev
One of those untapped — ConvertKit doesn't talk about it a lot, but it can be such a powerful tool, especially if you have a lot of tags. Some things actually work better as custom fields.

[00:32:54.020] - Liz
Yes, and I'm sure I'm missing a lot there. So I dig more into that and check that out. I think you also have something for our ""Inside the Speaker"" bonus bundle?

[00:33:02.690] - Bev
Yeah. Oh, that was that subscriber strategy.

[00:33:04.240] - Liz
Oh, that's the subscriber. Okay. I'm making sure we're clear what's what.

[00:33:08.130] - Bev
Yeah, I got the ""Fix Your Flow"" audio training that's free for everyone, and then the ""Subscriber Strategy"" workbook for the...

[00:33:15.990] - Liz
Inside the Speaker Bonus Bundle. Okay, awesome. Thank you so much again for sharing your knowledge. I learned new things. I'm sure people watching did too.

[00:33:26.300] - Bev
Thanks, Liz.

**Transcript:**
[00:00:09.390] - Liz Stapleton, Summit Host
All right, guys, I'm excited for today's session with Cousette, who is going to be talking to us about WordPress Maintenance and we'll get into that. But Cousette, welcome and thank you. If you wanted to share a little bit about your background.

[00:00:21.450] - Cousette Hoover, techiemamma.com
Yeah, for sure. I, I tell people that I'm just kind of the techie. My business name is Techie Mama and that just came about because I was a new mom and I still love tech, so hey, why not? And that has evolved into different things. But before I was a mom, I was always a tech person. I grew up in Silicon Valley. We moved to the Austin area. So I say that we move from Silicon Valley to Silicon Hills.

[00:00:51.960] - Cousette
And then my favorite little claim to fame is that God and Steve Jobs kind of worked out so that the first iPhone came out on my birthday.

[00:01:01.260] - Liz
Oh, very nice.

[00:01:05.400] - Cousette
But besides the more professional credentials, I have a background in computer science. I've been doing WordPress for 12+ years. I worked at the university teaching. I got into a lot of teaching and doing educational technology. So teaching faculty and also pre service teachers how to integrate technology into their classrooms. And that's where I really fell in love.And and I love what I do and I love my little ones, of course.

[00:01:34.830] - Liz
I mean, educational technology... Right now is essential. So...

[00:01:42.540] - Cousette
Yes, and it's not going away. So, you know, I get back to it in five years or so. It's still going to be there.

[00:01:50.190] - Liz
So let's talk about WordPress Maintenance, because I feel like there are a gazillion tutorials out there on how to start a blog. I have one evenn, you know, on like how to set up the hosting and install Wordpress, but that's, OK, great. There's not a lot of information on maintaining it.

[00:02:07.890] - Liz
I mean, a lot of hosts will push automatic updates to WordPress, but then there's plugins and themes and all sorts of other stuff. So what what is... I guess my first question is, what do you see people not doing that they should be doing?

[00:02:24.900] - Cousette
For sure, so I think one major thing is to keep up with the updates, to keep up with security issues.. There... One thing that is great about WordPress is that it powers so much of the web. But the flip side of that is that hackers also really love WordPress because with one system, they can get into a lot of sites, small and huge. And so once there's a security issue, 1. usually the plugin developers are very good at patching it and getting it to work again.

[00:03:06.750] - Cousette
But once there's a security issue, you need to go and find that update or you need to find another plugin that will work.

[00:03:14.580] - Cousette
Another thing I see a lot of people doing is just going and downloading either whatever they were recommended from some YouTube post or blog post or something like that, and maybe not checking on the date of it and still downloading that plugin. And when I go to the site to look at it, I see plugins that are over two years old that haven't been updated and WordPress now puts on the plugin page, ""this hasn't been updated in over two years."" you know, watch out.

[00:03:46.860] - Liz
Like years ago, maybe it was recommended, but now not so much. It's an old and SEO has kept it up or whatever.

[00:03:53.650] - Cousette
Right. And that's the problem. You know, it's a... It's a double edged sword. There's so much information online that is so wonderful. But, you know, the person that put up their ""how to start a blog"" and put up this awesome plugin may not be keeping that up and so may not even realize that it's outdated.

[00:04:15.330] - Liz
I should totally go back and check my tutorial. Now that I'm thinking about it...

[00:04:22.080] - Cousette
And one plugin gets a lot of recommendations and become really popular. And what I try and do is not necessarily always go for, like the little man, but I try and try out a whole bunch of plugins and kind of not just go with the one that's always recommended, but but look at the features and look at the different things. And a lot of times, like one may fit really well for one site, but another one may have a feature that someone else really wants.

[00:04:54.280] - Cousette
And so it just kind of learning a little bit more of like how to read the feature set and how I look up different plugins and kind of figure out what works best for your site.

[00:05:03.590] - Liz
Right. So some follow up questions from what you just said. How do you find out about security issues, because people don't necessarily like to advertise that there's security issues. I mean, they do send out e-mail, but are you getting emails on plugins?

[00:05:17.740] - Liz
You know, it's how do you find out about those?

[00:05:20.190] - Cousette
There's a couple of really good websites and a couple of really good plug ins that kind of help you keep track of everything. And going blank on the website that I check most often Sucrui, I believe, is one that keeps up a long list of plugin Boolen vulnerabilities. And if it's been updated and I also just searching Google searching or plugin vulnerabilities and WordPress.org, I believe has also a list....

[00:05:53.010] - Liz
So maybe setting like a Google alert or something.

[00:05:56.070] - Cousette
One more time?

[00:05:56.850] - Liz
Maybe setting like a Google alert for like WordPress security.

[00:05:59.790] - Cousette
Yeah, exactly. Yeah, I know there's a couple that have like a daily newsletter. Also, just go into your site on a regular basis. I'm in my site daily. I'm sure a lot of bloggers are. But if you're not, then make sure you're going in about, at least once a month or so and just checking the updates and seeing if there's an update.

[00:06:27.540] - Liz
Yeah, and I know there are several security plugins. Wordfence is a popular one. I believe so. Securi too, I think.

[00:06:37.620] - Cousette
Yes, it's a great. Yes, it's a plugin as well. So those focus not only on the plugins, but also on just kind of making the WordPress install a little stronger.

[00:06:48.940] - Cousette
So like a big thing, not so often anymore. But back in the day when you installed WordPress, the main admin user, the login was ""admin"". And so hackers could figure out, OK, I got a login. Now I just have to figure out what the password is. And so that sense has changed. And a lot of people recommend, you know, to set up your name or whatever as that first person,

[00:07:20.060] - Liz
In the admin role. Yeah, don't just use Admin it's kind of like using a password of ""1234""

[00:07:26.120] - Cousette
Exactly.

[00:07:28.620] - Liz
OK, so security plugins can help you keep an eye on things and help protect your site, even if other plug ins have some vulnerabilities. One of the other questions I had, is how would you recommend kind of researching a plugin that's recommended that, you know, is it just by the date? Is it like how do you kind of pick and choose?

[00:07:51.960] - Liz
Like you said, some features are good for one site but not for another. And then it's easy to have plugin overwhelm and have tons of plugins. You know, that a lot will repeat the same thing. So how do you research sort of whether you need a plug in or whether something you already have to do it or. Yeah,

[00:08:11.250] - Cousette
For sure, there's a lot plugins that do a lot of different things and you don't necessarily need an additional plugin for things.

[00:08:20.750] - Cousette
And what I do first is just search for the functionality.

[00:08:25.140] - Cousette
So let's say I want a SEO plugin. So I search WordPress ""SEO plugins"" and I'll get a million blog posts of different reviews. I look for the ones that are doing kind of comparisons and not just a specific one like Yoast or something like that. And so I'll get a blog post that has five different ones. I'll read through kind of what they say, the prices and stuff like that. That usually gives me a good idea if I read a couple of different blog posts of kind of what direction I want to take, the other things that you can do is if it's a plugin in the WordPress repository. Look at the reviews. Look at how many reviews it has. Is it five stars, a four star, and look at the actual comments of what they're saying. And then I think something that a lot of people don't do is look at how many open tickets there are. So there's a whole ticketing system within the WordPress repository for the plugins. See, are they being answered or are there tons of tickets still open and not closed? Are they active?

[00:09:42.560] - Cousette
And then watch for just when was the last update date? Are they keeping up with the or has it been several years since they updated it and so forth? Most plugins should be updating probably once, big plug  ins should be updating like at least once a month or so, once every two months or so. Especially with big WordPress core updates.

[00:10:13.340] - Cousette
A lot of times that will change the functionality of things and then the plugins have to update as well. So.

[00:10:23.610] - Liz
All right,

[00:10:24.090] - Cousette
So just a combination of all those things and having a feature set that you want,

[00:10:31.260] - Liz
So once it's recommended to you, kind of do your homework on it. And and I would say, because I've made this mistake where I have multiple plugins that do the same thing, like you might already have something installed and maybe that's not the reason you installed it, but it has that functionality too.

[00:10:46.210] - Cousette
Right, exactly. Yeah. Like a lot of SEO plugins will do all of your social media connections, like the Pinterest connection and stuff like that. And will connect analytics for you or have a place to put in that snippet and stuff like that. So but then another tutorial that you read tells you that you have to install like header footer code managers like that to put in the code.

[00:11:11.100] - Cousette
And but it was already in this other plugin so you don't necessarily have to do that.

[00:11:18.630] - Liz
OK, so I want to talk and ask you about free versus paid plugins, because obviously there's tons of free ones and you can really get by with free ones. I think paid ones tend to be updated more, is my kind of understanding. I've definitely used some paid plugins in the past. I'm not sure from using any paid ones right now.

[00:11:37.260] - Liz
But so kind of especially when a plugin has a free versus paid version...

[00:11:43.470] - Cousette
Right.

[00:11:43.980] - Liz
I feel like people need, they feel like they need the paid version, but not necessarily. So how do you kind of figure that out?

[00:11:51.000] - Cousette
Yeah, I look at the... I look first for plug ins are in the repository because I think that's always a good place to start. The whole kind of mission of WordPress is to be open source and to be a community driven. And so if the plugin developers are somehow in the repository, you know that that's kind of part of their mission as well, which I always like. Whereas if they're just going on to marketplaces like envoto or something like that, then they're kind of not so much part of that mission.

[00:12:24.960] - Cousette
And then the other thing is I usually just install the free version and just see kind of what....

[00:12:34.500] - Liz
How it works,

[00:12:35.400] - Cousette
What features are there, and look at the paid version of the features. I really don't have that many paid plugins. It takes a lot for me to do a paid plugin, very specific functionality like my LMS (Learning Management System) plugin. That's a paid plugin I'm using LearnDash, um a membership plugin. I would probably get a paid version...

[00:12:59.910] - Liz
Stuff like that, where it's I think for product sales type of stuff. That makes sense.

[00:13:04.060] - Cousette
Yeah, that's true. WooCommerce, the core is free and then there's a lot of add ons that are paid.

[00:13:12.810] - Liz
I mean there's that's a whole that's a whole rabbit hole we could go down. I do want to because you keep mentioning the repository and I feel like some people may not know what you're referring to when you say that. That's when you go into the plugin section in WordPress and you go to like Add New and you search is that what we're referring to?

[00:13:32.430] - Cousette
Yes.

[00:13:32.510] - Liz
I just want to make sure that was clear....

[00:13:33.540] - Cousette
It's that directory of plugins and there's also a website on WordPress.org  that has that full directory as well as that you can search on WordPress.org. And both of those places are known as the repository.

[00:13:49.080] - Liz
OK, I just wanted to make sure that, yeah, we cleared that up because I feel like some people who are new at this could be confused by that language. OK, so when you're choosing plugins, paid or free, you're looking at kind of when they were last updated. But I know sometimes you don't always want to install the update right away because there can be bugs. So how do you know when to run those updates on your themes on your plugins? Because you want to keep your site up to date. And again, I think WordPress is usually automatically updated by your host but the other stuff themes, you know, because I'll see, I pay someone to deal with that for me, but it can be don't update yet because there's a bug and they have to fix it, so. How do you decide when you're updating and when you're not?

[00:14:37.130] - Cousette
For sure, there's no magic way to decide. I think the magic word is ""back up"", back up, back up, back up.

[00:14:46.310] - Cousette
If your host has a way to do a staging site, definitely do the updates on the staging site, test it out. That's why it's nice to pay someone to do it, because they can do all of that for you.

[00:15:01.700] - Cousette
But back up, try and update on the staging site, if you don't have a staging site then make sure you have a good backup and just go one by one and test it out. And I think most hosts will install the security updates for WordPress core. I don't know if they'll do the major update. So like when Gutenberg came out.

[00:15:27.410] - Liz
Yeah. I mean, it kind of depends. Like sometimes I get a message from my host saying they push the update and sometimes they don't. And I resisted the Gutenberg update for quite a while. Before I finally made the change.

[00:15:37.750] - Cousette
A lot of people did it.

[00:15:41.900] - Liz
Change is hard

[00:15:44.600] - Cousette
Change is hard, it is, it's so hard.

[00:15:47.330] - Liz
But let's talk backups for a second. Right, because so there's a lot of different ways to do that. But one thing you don't want to do, from my understanding, is you don't want to back up to your host because that'll eat up all your space...

[00:16:00.890] - Cousette
For sure.

[00:16:01.850] - Liz
So how... What kind of backups recommendation do you recommend and then... You know, where, what kind of ...How would you set it up? How would you recommend people do that if they can't afford to pay someone the kind of have a daily backup system?

[00:16:17.570] - Cousette
There's a lot of options, all from like do it yourself, very low cost to to kind of more of a service that will do it for you.

[00:16:30.050] - Cousette
One of my favorite services that will do it for you is called BlogVault, and I believe they're about like $8 a month or something like that. I wish I could afford them for my business side of things, for all of my clients, but they're really nice. They have a really nice dashboard where you can set up backups. They backup automatically, they take care of the space. So you're not backing up to your host. And they also have a way to do a staging site so you can have like a temporary staging site on their systems.

[00:17:08.180] - Cousette
So that's kind of one of the more paid versions. Jetpack also has a really nice one. It's within the Jetpack kind of ecosystem..

[00:17:17.360] - Liz
Jetpack is kind of heavy on your site, though, isn't it?

[00:17:20.120] - Cousette
It is. It's one of those things that you can weigh if you're using Jetpack. Like a lot of the features of Jetpack, it can replace a lot of those plugins. And then it's not so bad, if that's the only thing that you have, but it can be a little slow. You can also turn a lot of features off and only turn on the features that you really want to use. So if you're like, I really just want backups to be taken care of, you can just turn on that feature and nothing else.

[00:17:53.900] - Cousette
So it's it's definitely a thing to weigh, but it's definitely not necessarily a fully bad thing. Just depends what else you have, because Jetpack will take care of a SEO, will take care of analytics, will take care of a lot of things if you want it to.

[00:18:11.890] - Liz
So and I think is Updrafts plus another is another option?

[00:18:19.280] - Cousette
Updraft is another option.There's a lot of options like Updraft and BackupWP, BackWPup. I think I always want to say, pup, because I know that... All of those are kind of more of a do it yourself.

[00:18:39.230] - Cousette
And that's where you have to be careful to not choose your host as the place to back it up for a couple of different reasons. One, yeah, it will take down all your space very quickly, but two, if your backup is on your host, then if the host blows up, then your backup is gone too, for lack of a better way... if something happened... The hurricane hits your host, then you know...

[00:19:06.860] - Liz
And sometimes accessing a backup from a host is a little harder.

[00:19:10.100] - Cousette
Yeah, for sure. For sure. So with updraft or backWPup, you can set up like Dropbox or all of these kind of cloud services. I recently set up... It's a little bit more back and forth, a little bit more of a setup. But it's a one time thing. I set up Amazon AWS space and that is very cost effective. I have something like 20 different sites backed up there and it's like two bucks a month. So it's it's a really great way because I kept running out of space on Dropbox and different things and they're not really set up for like big backups like that, whereas AWS is just kind of the content space.

[00:19:56.810] - Cousette
So yeah, there's a lot of different options, just depends on how much you want to do it yourself. And then if you get kind of a care plan or maintenance package as a service, I don't know about you, but like I offer the backups as part of my services.

[00:20:15.390] - Liz
Yeah. mine does as well.

[00:20:17.540] - Cousette
So it's a lot of those will do that as well. So then you don't have to worry about maintenance or backups. Yeah, they take care of it all.

[00:20:28.160] - Liz
And if you are DIY-ing it of course do a backup before you do updates. But to set up just a regular monthly backup, weekly backup?

[00:20:38.090] - Cousette
I would do at least a weekly backup and check with your host too, some hosts, actually do backup for you and some will backup off site so you can also check with your host. WP Engine is a great one that will backup offsite. They do daily backups and then you can do kind of what I call like on demand backup. So right before you do an update or something like that.

[00:21:08.240] - Cousette
But a lot of hosts will just back up on their own servers and so then you lose that...

[00:21:14.450] - Liz
It's not as helpful as having... Having it yourself. It's kind of like the the whole like you don't own your social media, but you own your email list type of thing.

[00:21:22.960] - Cousette
Yes, yes.

[00:21:26.270] - Liz
All right. And let me just review. See if I have any other follow up questions based on what we chatted about, I think those are my questions wrapping up. I know you do have something for attendee's. Do you want to tell us about it?

[00:21:45.710] - Cousette
Yes. So I have an awesome checklist of what you should be doing on your blog daily, weekly and monthly for maintenance. So some of the things that we talked about, like doing backups, doing updates and tips and tricks on how to do that and have a nice, easy checklist to to get that done. And so the headache of knowing what to do and when to do it is gone.

[00:22:10.970] - Liz
Yes, that sounds awesome. Definitely. Check that out, because if you're not maintaining your WordPress, not paying someone like Cousette or one of our other experts, and you do need to make sure you have a system in place and this checklist is a great way to get started until you can afford to pay someone to do for you. And I think you also have something for those that buy the Pro Pass. What what can they get inside the Pro Pass from you?

[00:22:39.470] - Cousette
Yes. So really related with this topic altogether. If you buy the Pro Pass, I have a course called Life After Blog Setup because there's a lot of life after you set up your blog. And that covers everything from how to do backups, even a backup on AWS, how to set up security, how to maintain security and plugin updates and so forth, and takes you step by step through all those things. So it would be a really great way to learn how to do it yourself.

[00:23:15.080] - Liz
OK, yes. So if you don't have the Pro Pass, definitely check that out. And if you purcahsed the All Access Pass and you're like, I want the Pro Pass, just shoot us an email support@elizabethstapleton.com. We'll give you a discount for the price difference of what you already paid versus what it costs now. Cousette, thank you so much for doing this. This was, I think, a lot of really valuable information that people don't always think about or realize is important. So thank you again.

[00:23:40.790] - Cousette
For sure.

[00:23:42.240] - Liz
All right. Have a good rest of your day. Everyone go check out. Go get that checklist. The link is below. I think it's to the right. I really need to figure this out because each time I record, I'm like it's on the page, I swear.

[00:23:53.810] - Liz
But in that way, anyway, it is on the page of the link. But or you could just go to techiemama.com/BBS21. So if you're having trouble finding the link on the page, go there, get your checklist and say hi to Cousette.

Welcome to the Blogger Breakthrough Summit in our session today. I'm so excited to be here. In today's presentation, we are going to go over seven secrets to super charge your blog for success.

[00:00:28.010] - Cousett
Before we get started, a little bit about me, welcome to the Techie Mama world. 40 some years ago, I was born in Silicon Valley that pretty much made me a tech girl from day one. I made it official around 2003 with a degree in Computer science and have been designing, developing and teaching technology ever since. Before kids, I was a dissertation away from a PhD in educational technology.

[00:00:55.160] - Cousett
Now I'm on a mission to empower mompreneurs to automate, build and scale their businesses. I started Techie Mama as a small blog with a newborn in tow. Since then, it has grown and flourished into so much more. I have two incredible just as tech loving boys who are six and four already. My husband is invested in the Opensource online tech community as a WordPress core developer and a senior engineer at his company.

[00:01:25.440] - Cousett
We live in Silicon Hills or the Austin, Texas area. You can dive more into the Techie Mama world on social at Techie Mama or by joining our BFF community. Scan the QR code to get all of the details. Nobody wants to go to a slow site. If the site doesn't rank in Google, traffic will be low.

[00:01:50.210] - Cousett
So, the more traffic will show Google that the website is not only usable, but it also answers the right questions.

[00:02:00.790] - Cousett
Let's dive into these three. First up, we have SEO. SEO stands for Search Engine Optimization. Winning the game of SEO comes down to attracting traffic to your site based on what someone is searching for using Google or any other search engine. But really, it's Google.

[00:02:20.660] - Cousett
There are two flavors of SEO, on-page SEO and off-page SEO. They refer to where things are optimized. On-page SEO is all about what a visitor experiences as they visit your page. This includes what you write, how it's organized, how it's presented, how it's formatted and the overall user experience, including site speed. Off-page SEO is everything outside of your site, building authority with backlinks, social media, brand mentions, and any other activities that happen away from your site.

[00:02:59.890] - Cousett
SEO is a huge topic, but some things to consider right away to get started include knowing and targeting your primary and secondary keywords, writing quality original content, formatting the content. So that it's easy for search engines to consume and understand, using things like featured snippets and other schemas, optimizing your page titles and meta descriptions, and using short descriptive URLs.

[00:03:32.810] - Cousett
Next up, we have traffic. There are many ways to bring more traffic to your site. These are some of the best tried and tested. As you consider these though, make sure you don't tackle all at once. To see the benefit and track the results, try out one at a time.

[00:03:49.690] - Cousett
So, first up, create amazing, share-worthy content. Again, we have the content. Content is king, it's the center of all. Share your content on social media, build your email list.

[00:04:05.550] - Cousett
So, if content is king, then email list is queen, if not more. It is hand in hand the two most powerful things I think for a blogger. Guest posting. So, guest posting involves posting your articles or your expertise on someone else's blog and also, possibly having someone else post on yours. It's a back and forth share of content and information and it gives Google a chance to see, hey, this person is an expert in what they're talking about because they're being featured on other sites and it builds authority and backlinks and trust with both Google and others as they're searching for you. Participate in online forums, reference others, collaborate with other content creators.

[00:04:58.300] - Cousett
I really, really enjoy this one. Collaborating with others in summits and bundles, I think is a great way to grow your email list, to build authority, and to just grow your community. Advertise, comment on blogs and create various forms of content. This last one as well, I think is super important. We all consume and prefer to consume content in different ways. When someone may enjoy reading and reads very quickly and consumes the information in a written format very quickly, someone else may enjoy hearing it and listening to it through an audiobook or through an audio feed. And whereas someone else may be very visual and may really like to see a video about it.

[00:05:46.090] - Cousett
So, having different forms of content also helps to reuse your content, repurpose your content, and also reaches out to a broader audience.

[00:05:58.760] - Cousett
Next up, we have my favorite quote or kind of factoid about speed. So, a one second delay in page load time yields 11% fewer views, 16% decrease in customer satisfaction, and a 7% loss in conversions. This is huge. And speed is a huge issue and a huge kind of topic that you need to think about as a blogger, and so someone that gets very technical very quickly. So, depending on your platform and whether it's a self-hosted WordPress site or something else, you might have more or less control on all the factors that affect page speed. Some of the tips to get started and just some general rules of thumb when you're thinking about page speed is doing things like making sure all of your JavaScript and CSS files are external to your main site, as many things external as possible, so it's not loading down your page load. Using caching systems.

[00:07:11.310] - Cousett
Avoid resizing images in HTML, so making sure that your images are the right size and the right resolution for viewing on the web. Our phones these days take amazing photos, but they can pretty much be photos that can be hung up on a wall. The resolution is so incredible and so huge, it's definitely not something that's meant to be viewed online. So, make sure that you're resizing these and that you're resizing it away from your website before you upload it to your website. Hand in hand with resizing is using new file formats for images such as WebP and others that are optimized specifically for the web and optimized specifically to be, to have a good speed, a good page load on the web.

[00:08:08.590] - Cousett
And lastly, don't use images to display text. This is kind of an older habit of sites to do kind of a fancy button or something like that and use an image. But nowadays we really need to focus on text, just being text and not weighing down the site by using images where they're not necessary. The overarching idea here is what do you need on your site to convey your message and what is extra? So, think about little kind of extra fancy things on your site, like maybe image slider, or image gallery, or a chat feature, or something that's dynamically loaded.

[00:08:56.080] - Cousett
All of these little things are usually JavaScript that's loaded and all of that weighs down the site. Some of them, you may say, hey, a lot of people chat with me, and so that's something that I'm not willing to say no to. But others, like, maybe an image gallery or slider, you may say, well, it's a fancy little thing but it doesn't really need to be there. I can just put one thing there instead of having it cycled through. Same with popups and various things like that.

[00:09:33.790] - Cousett
So, think about what is necessary and what is extra or superfluous for your site and for conveying your message. Last but not least, we did not talk about ads and ad networks for passive income, but it's a popular option. I don't recommend it early on because you need to have so much traffic for it to make any kind of dent in your income. But the other flip side to that is that those ads also weighed on your site a lot. So, the more ads that you have popping up and showing up across the page, that's all going to add load time to your site and you want to really avoid that.

[00:10:18.340] - Cousett
So, think about those things, and think about what you can kind of remove to kind of slim down your site. And when it comes down to it, especially if you have a WordPress site where you have a lot of control over a lot of these things, if it's too much to handle on your own, if it's too technical, search out a developer that might be able to help, that might be able to kind of really dive into some of the issues. Another thing with WordPress sites, we'll talk about this in the next slide, but all hosting companies are not made equal. So, if your site is really slow and you're thinking there's not really that much going on, think about your host, and whether it might not be the host that is not optimized for websites. There's a lot that goes on for hosting a website.

[00:11:13.920] - Cousett
And the more sites that they can host on a server, the more, the cheaper it is for them to, you know, host each one and the cheaper rates that they can pass on to the customer. But what that does is it really divides their resources and way too many customers. And each individual site gets only a sliver of the total resources, which ends up meaning that there's a big effect on page speed.

[00:11:49.840] - Cousett
Alright. So, last up, we have our last secret for our blogging supercharge tips is a combination of maintenance topics and a few extra things that can add to the depth and breadth of your blog. So, first, for some maintenance tips, this is especially talking for those who have self-hosted WordPress sites where you have a lot more control and a lot more responsibility for maintenance than if it's hosted with another platform like Square Space or Wix, or so many others out there. WordPress is what I know, WordPress is what I've done for 10-15 years.

[00:12:34.390] - Cousett
And so, WordPress is what I can talk about a lot. Some of these things may relate to other platforms and some may not. But I couldn't tell you what relates to what. So, for self-hosted WordPress sites, you want to make sure to keep up with security. WordPress powers close to 36% of the web and hackers love to try and break into sites. So, keeping up with the security of your site by making sure your host value security, your site itself is secure from hackers. It's really, really important.

[00:13:14.660] - Cousett
Pick a good hosting company. So, we kind of started talking about this, there are so many options for WordPress sites out there when it comes to hosting, they are not all created equal. And a solid host will be the difference many times between a slow site, a secure site and good support, and not having those things. Keep up with SSL certificates. So, making sure that your site is secure with an SSL certificate, is super important. Years ago, Google decided to take secure sites into account when ranking, and now it's so hard to find a site that's not secure. You want to look for the padlock that is in the top left hand corner of the address bar. It does require a little bit of maintenance sometimes.

[00:14:02.800] - Cousett
If you have a certificate that renews and it doesn't auto-renew by the host, then you might have to go and click a button, so that it renews. It's not much, but it is something that you have to remember to go to. Your host should for sure offer certificates free of charge. If they don't, then consider changing hosts. Certificates are available free of charge.

[00:14:28.690] - Cousett
They used to be more complex to create, and so they cost. Now they are completely free. There's many options for certificates to be free and if your host isn't on top of that, then it may be time to consider changing hosts. Using strong and secure passwords, this is so important in today's world where so much of our information is out there. Making sure you have access to a password manager and can create secure passwords, it's super important for your site and for your data.

[00:15:04.240] - Cousett
If you can enhance security with two-factor authentication, it's just a bonus. It's so important to use strong passwords and not to share passwords and to do everything you can to kind of maintain your data, because it can be hacked so easily and it can cause so many issues so easily. Maintaining backups on your host and off your host. A couple of years ago, there was a hosting company, they decided one day, for whatever reason, to just completely shut down and not inform their customers at all about it. So, overnight, they shut down their social media accounts, they shut down their email, they shut down their support networks, and they shut down their website, and they shut down the websites of all of their customers.

[00:15:57.360] - Cousett
They woke up the next morning and found out that all of their content, all of their business, all of their web presence on their website was gone. The host no longer existed. The host did not respond to inquiries. The backups were on the host, and it was gone. Another scenario was someone who woke up, found out that their site was gone, that their business data was gone, that their content was gone.

[00:16:27.110] - Cousett
But they knew that they had backups easily accessible on Dropbox or Google Drive or AWS. They went to the next host and said, hey, my site's down. I need a new host. Here's my backup. Can you get me back up and running?

[00:16:44.910] - Cousett
And within hours, maybe less, they were back up and running and set to go. So, having backups off-site of your host is so important. It's so important to have it on your computer, on Dropbox, wherever you want to put it. Basically, content that you're not really going to touch until you need it. So, you just need some space out there, space on the backup drive, space somewhere to put it until that day that you need it.

[00:17:18.490] - Cousett
These next few things are just additional things that you can build around your blog to additionally have income sources, create community, and expand your reach and expertise. All right. Our action steps. So, what will your first secret be that you want to kind of attack to supercharge your blog? And then second, similar but a little different, what secret do you think will help your blog the most at your current stage?

[00:17:49.120] - Cousett
So, do you think that speed is an issue, site speed is an issue? Do you think that your SEO could be improved a lot? What do you think will make the most impact on your blog at your current stage? And this may be similar to your item for number one, or maybe completely different, so.

[00:18:11.360] - Cousett
What I want you to do here is just think of just one or two things of all this content. We covered a lot in the time that we have together. There's so much content here and there's so much to consider and there are so many topics to dive deeper into because we just skim the surface on all of these. So, think about just one thing that you want to do. One thing that is going to be your first action step, your first secret that you're going to tackle, and move forward with that and then go to the next one.

[00:18:43.770] - Cousett
And don't be afraid to ask for help and ask for what others have done because you may get some answers that way.

[00:18:55.090] - Cousett
But overall, just don't try to do too many things at once. It gets overwhelming very quickly. So, pick one thing and move forward with it. All right. So, some of my favorite things and resources, you know that I'm tech girl, techie mama, and I love to test different tools. I love to break tools and use them to their capacity.

[00:19:22.390] - Cousett
And my preferences change a lot as the technology changes. And I'm looking for that silver bullet that will do the task I wanted to do in the exact way that I wanted to do. So, I usually qualify my recommendations with my current favorites because things can change so quickly. So, let's dive in here. Currently, Google Domains is my preference to register domains.

[00:19:47.920] - Cousett
It's super slick, it's super straightforward, and the prices don't fluctuate, they're just solid. If for whatever reason, the extension that you're looking to purchase is not available on Google Domains, Hover and Namecheap are also some great options for registering domains. Google workspace also is amazing for email and the whole Google suite on your domain. It builds authority, it builds kind of your expertise and your presence to have that branded email address. And Google workspace is a great way to acquire that. For these next couple are for self-hosted WordPress sites, so for hosting Flywheel iss my choice because they're great for beginners, they have amazing support and features and they're fairly affordable in comparison to others.

[00:20:53.660] - Cousett
And then also Elementor Pro is great for landing pages as a builder. Bloomberg, the built-in builder in WordPress, is also super flexible and it's just amazing how it's growing and changing the world of things as we are experiencing it. Elementor can have some issues with speed. It can weigh down your site. So, I really, really recommend that you keep it as landing page builder and do not do any blog posts or normal pages with Elementor.

[00:21:35.890] - Cousett
ConvertKit is my current tool for email marketing and currently happy with it. It's great for beginners. I want to say that I tried so many and ConvertKit was the first one where things started clicking as far as automation and segmenting and doing some different things. They have a great ecommerce built-in and some great tools, and they're great for bloggers and creators. And Thrive Cart, my business wouldn't be where it is today without Thrive Cart. After so many trial and errors to have a shopping cart, to have ecommerce presence on my site.

[00:22:16.990] - Cousett
It never equal to what has been revolutionized in my sales with Thrive Cart. Convert box is also amazing and incredibly powerful for your lead magnets, for offering personalized offers, for kind of knowing your visitors and knowing which offers they've seen, which ones they haven't, and offering them the right things at the right time, so you can segment your different visitors in a good way. And then last but not least, the super popular Shopify. This is definitely a new venture in my business, but it is trusted for ecommerce by so many and it is a solid option for creating any type of storefront. I'm really enjoying my experience with Shopify and it also has features of email marketing and blogging.

[00:23:09.600] - Cousett
So, if you're looking at doing something that is ecommerce first, it's definitely a solid option for including those other things. Or if you're just adding a storefront to your blog, then it can definitely be on a subdomain or a different domain and be kind of linked together. Lastly, I have a gift for you. I hope you enjoy. It is at Go.Techie.Mom/BBSgift, and you can scan the QR code or type in that URL and get it. It's a treasure chest of a whole bunch of different resources and checklists of all of these different topics to help you along on this journey.

[00:23:54.260] - Cousett

And I hope you have a great rest of your day.

**Transcript:**
Liz Stapleton [00:00:00]:
All right, guys, I am super excited about this next session with Grayson Bell from Imark Interactive. Welcome, Grayson.

Grayson Bell [00:00:06]:
Happy to be here.

Liz Stapleton [00:00:08]:
Yes, I really appreciate it. I know I, like, hounded you into doing it. I'm like, we could do it as a Q&A. Please just do it because everyone learns from you.

Grayson Bell [00:00:15]:
Well, I mean, you know me for a long time. I'm not a very good presentation guy, but I'll talk to you all day long about WordPress, yeah.

Liz Stapleton [00:00:21]:
And, I mean, your knowledge is just every little thing. I'm like Grayson and is this okay?

Grayson Bell [00:00:27]:
All the things.

Liz Stapleton [00:00:28]:
All the things. So can you tell us a little bit about your background? Because you are, in my mind, the WordPress guru go to. But how did you get there?

Grayson Bell [00:00:40]:
So I paid a lot of people. I'm just kidding. I didn't pay a lot of people. So I've actually been working in WordPress since early 2004. So basically a year after it was launched, I started so many blogs, I can't even imagine how bad they are they were, but I basically have taught myself how to do WordPress over the years. And then I got into a financial blogger community, Fincon, and people started asking me questions about WordPress because I built my own site and built all these others, and then it kind of just snowballed from not a I'm not a developer by trade. I basically self taught, but I have a lot of years of experience.

Liz Stapleton [00:01:26]:
Yeah, you've never not been able to give me an answer when I have a question, that's for sure. And just a fun little background story. Fincon one year was held on Halloween. So there was a big Halloween costume party and a huge group of people I don't even know. Was there, like, 50 I don't even know.

Grayson Bell [00:01:47]:
I think they were 30, 35 a lot.

Liz Stapleton [00:01:50]:
But they were wearing, like, I'm the Grayson Bell of and what they were an expert in, because being the grace and bell of is considered being the expert, the go to person.

Grayson Bell [00:02:00]:
That was one of the coolest things that I've ever been a part well, actually, I wasn't really a part of it. It was kind of like a surprise, but when your group of your peers think highly of you enough that they put you on shirts, and they kind of still kind of do that, I think somebody the other day in the Fincon group said, I want to be the Grayson Bell of YouTube videos.

Liz Stapleton [00:02:20]:
Nice.

Grayson Bell [00:02:21]:
I was like, hey, it still works.

Liz Stapleton [00:02:24]:
Yeah. So really excited to ask you questions because you do know through Imark Interactive, your company, you help a lot of blogger with WordPress tech support, and so you've seen a lot of mistakes people have made. You've seen a lot of what good and bad things to do. It took me three years to listen to you on some things, but I got there eventually the first thing I kind of want to touch on, because even five years in, I still talk to you about it. Hosting. Thoughts on hosting and picking the right host would be, let's just go there.

Grayson Bell [00:03:01]:
All right, so I'm going to go there. I'm going to go in It. People know me, I'm pretty honest and upfront. I'm not a big fan of several hosts, and there are many reasons for it, but anything GoDaddy related, anything EIG related, which is our big friends at Bluehost, HostGator, Small Orange, and 65 others or something like that. Not a big fan of these companies. The reason why they have very low prices and the reason why is because they stuff a lot of people on servers. They don't really follow the trends on new technology, and they really just offshore all their support and everything. Kind of not a good model. What they do is they buy up hosts and usually you'll see the host kind of fall apart after they buy them up. Like, Bluehost used to be a great host before EIG bought them. I think in 2012 it was I was actually on HostGator for eight years. I was on HostGator. They got bought out in 2013 and servers were down for over a week yeah. When they were trying to migrate them over. So I'm not a big fan. I will say a caveat is that there's no perfect host for everybody. I can give you recommendations all day long, and it might work for a ton of people, but one person might have a bad experience or it might not work for them, and that's okay. The beauty of hosting is that typically you can move a lot of hosts.

Liz Stapleton [00:04:28]:
Will move it for you.

Grayson Bell [00:04:29]:
Yeah, the good hosts will move your site for you, basically for free. They'll pull your site over and then basically get it running. And if there's any issues, typically the good ones will give you support for it. Others, like GoDaddy, will charge you for such experiences. So it's nice. So for hosts, you want, here are some things that I look for. You want a host that has solid state hard drives because that's just really what it's all about nowadays. Those are very fast HostGator, and all those others still use very old school hard drives. And there's a reason why, because it's cheap. You want a host that has data centers where your people are living or going to your site. So if you are in the UK and all of your visitors are in the US. Or most of your visitors in the US. You don't want a server in the UK. The distance between the server and the person does make a difference. So you want somebody that has servers in several locations. Most good hosts have at least three or four, so you can be across different parts. If you want to try to get one. In the central US. If most of your visitors are in the US. You're going to be able to span both sides. So it kind of works. Then you want one that's proactive in regards to security malware, some of them will do scans for you and stuff like that. And they see scans, they'll kind of say, hey, you got malware. Some of them will charge you to clean it, some of them will not, and they'll just do it for you. But really it comes down to price for a lot of people. Most starting out and getting started probably don't want to pay more than $10. And you can still find some pretty good hosts that are under $10. But the $2.95 shared hosting. Yeah. So shared hosting is basically option. Yeah, shared hosting is what most people are going to start out with, and that's perfectly okay. There's nothing wrong with starting out with shared hosting. And I know some people that stayed on shared hosting probably way longer than they should have, but they didn't really have any problems. But once I started getting more and more visitors, you typically have to move off and pay higher fees. Now if I think about it this way, if you're paying higher fees and you have a lot more traffic, that's a good thing. It's not bad that you have to go pay more for hosting. You shouldn't be upset about that. That's part of the business you're growing. Yeah. So you also want to look to see what kind of support they have. If it's live chat over the phone or email, some people want over the phone. I'm not a big over the phone type guy because I know when I do support for people, it could take me quite a while to figure out what's going on. And you just sitting on the phone. It's just awkward. It just gets a little awkward. Live chat and email typically are a little bit better. I know some companies like Big Scoots that's very responsive on email. Some others can take 24 hours to get back to you on email. It really just depends on your own personal preferences on that.

Liz Stapleton [00:07:37]:
Things to look out for, for sure.

Grayson Bell [00:07:38]:
Yeah, so, I mean, there's so much some companies that I recommend, SiteGround is still one of them. Name hero is one of them.

Liz Stapleton [00:07:48]:
Namecheap is great for getting your domains though.

Grayson Bell [00:07:50]:
Namecheap is awesome for getting your domains. Yes, you get free privacy. They are pretty cheap. I do not recommend them for hosting. They do have that, it's just not very good. Recommend Big Scoots when you get onto higher levels, 80,000, 100,000 plus I don't really recommend their shared hosting that much. It's not as good as Sitegrounds or the name Heroes. If you need to get into other services like virtual private servers, VPs, you'll hear that a lot. Things like Cloudways are really good. Flywheel is still really good. WP Engine is good but expensive. It's probably one of the most expensive hosts out there. Liquid Web is very good too. They have really great support and different plans, but they're really not made for beginner shared host. They don't do any shared hosting. So theirs is all cloud or VPs or dedicated. So those are some good companies. There are so many others out there. But you're going to pay a if you want some of the ones that a lot of people recommend, you're typically going to be paying more than $5 a month.

Liz Stapleton [00:09:00]:
Yeah, but the value of making sure your site doesn't go down, you have that support, there's good cause for it. And I think knowing that can be something intimidating. Look at until you realize that good hosts will move you so you don't.

Grayson Bell [00:09:13]:
Yeah, I'll also put a caveat out there that never ever rely on host backups for your site. Ever. It doesn't matter if they include it in there, like WP Engine includes theirs in there. Many others say, hey, we provide 30 days of backups in 15 years. I can't count the number of times where I've seen whole servers get corrupted and their backups get wiped out. Stuff happens. These things, it's hardware, it goes bad and you are sitting there holding with nothing. You have nothing left because you didn't have your own backups. So I just want to put that out there because I say that every time I talk to people, please, no.

Liz Stapleton [00:09:53]:
These are the things we want to know.

Grayson Bell [00:09:54]:
Please have your own backups.

Liz Stapleton [00:09:56]:
What would you recommend for doing backups? A certain plugin or anything in particular? I'm one of your monthly customers. I think I get backups, right?

Grayson Bell [00:10:03]:
Yeah. So you get daily backups through Blog Vault, which is a paid service. And typically we have another redundant one, which is WP Time Capsule is what we use. That is a paid service. But as an agency, we get a little bit better deal. Most people I recommend when you're first starting out is Updraft Plus, which is a great one. But what you want to do, and the very important thing is when you set it up, you want to make sure that it's putting the backups off site. Either.

Liz Stapleton [00:10:32]:
Google drive, it'll completely blow.

Grayson Bell [00:10:35]:
Yeah. So what happens when Updraft Plus and a lot of backup plugins run, they just store those files on your server. So you're basically copying your website over and over and over again. And so it fills up your disk space, which when you have a host that has solid state hard drives, that disk space costs a lot more money. So they don't give you as much. Like a Blue host for their lowest plan will give you like 100GB. Or some of them say unmetered. They don't say unlimited anymore. Now they say unmetered because the cost for disk space on really bad hard drives is super cheap. Problem is that you're going to start slowing your site down because you're storing these. So you need to make sure that you push them off to a Dropbox or a Google Drive. Never click the email button in Updraft Plus. Nothing can email you a site. It can't zip up a file and email you the site. A lot of people, we get a lot of tickets that come in, they're like, I ran out of disk space and I'm like it's because it's trying to email you a four gig zip file may have done that. I don't know why they even have that option to be honest. It's a terrible option, but don't click that. So I usually typically recommend if you're technical enough and you know how to set up Amazon S three, that's probably going to be the cheapest option. But it is not easy to set up. It takes some knowledge and nothing in Amazon on the technical side is easy to set up.

Liz Stapleton [00:12:11]:
Sounds about right.

Grayson Bell [00:12:12]:
Yeah, but I would recommend either. Typically Dropbox is usually the best. Google Drive works because it's free. But it does have a lot of communication problems with Updraft Plus. It doesn't communicate that it actually finished the download of the backup. So when it doesn't communicate back to Updraft Plus, updraft just keeps storing stuff on the server instead of taking them. Really, I think that's an issue with Google. But there's so many good to know, good to know.

Liz Stapleton [00:12:41]:
So besides not backing up and stuff, what are some of the issues you see come up the most or the biggest mistakes people make that you have to fix or help them with?

Grayson Bell [00:12:52]:
So I'll go with the elephant in the room that everybody's talking about right now. Sight speed. Everyone is wanting to kill some site speed. Everyone's like got to have a fast site, got to have a fast site. And yes, that's very important. There are several things in site speed that you should not be doing and a lot of these themes out there have them on there and it looks pretty and everyone's so excited about it. But don't put sliders on your site. Sliders are terrible for site speed. And to be honest, I think there was a study like several years ago that nobody interacts after the first slide. People just scroll, no one sits there and is watching a slider and going, oh this is nice. People don't really do that anymore. And the impact sliders have compared to what people see. Just take it off, just take the slider off, get rid of it, it'll be better, you don't need it. Another thing are my favorite Instagram widgets. Everybody loves to put a good Instagram widget on their site. Here's two reasons why I don't like that. One, all those images have to load when the page loads because you're loading them off of Instagram's CDN. You're not loading them from your own site so you can't control how Instagram runs their cache and all that other kind of stuff you have to pull all the images. And sometimes it doesn't show the thumbnails, it shows the full size image. So each image and usually people put like eight across or maybe like four or five, whatever, each image might be like 800 pixels wide. You're like trying to load all these images and you're like, why is my site so slow? Instagram widgets. Here's another thing. You don't want to take people off your site unless you specifically want to grow Instagram. Don't use it. You don't want people moving away from your site unless there's Instagram to get.

Liz Stapleton [00:14:46]:
People to your site.

Grayson Bell [00:14:48]:
Yeah, people typically go the other direction. The only reason why you want people to leave your site is through affiliate links, email, landing page newsletter or something like that. And typically you don't want to lose your site or maybe an external link that you put on for an advertiser or something like that. You don't want people to leave your site. You want them to get the information and maybe hit up a couple of affiliate links along the way. Or maybe they'll click on an ad. But really, people don't do that anymore either.

Liz Stapleton [00:15:16]:
An accident.

Grayson Bell [00:15:17]:
Yeah. The other things really bad. The Pinterest board widgets, we see those a lot. So you can go on Pinterest and you can say like, I think there's a section in there you can create a widget.

Liz Stapleton [00:15:28]:
Yeah. Yeah.

Grayson Bell [00:15:30]:
So the big problem with those is that a lot of times we see the same one with the Twitter ones. We see that when you have to scroll through them, it's got like a vertical scroll bar just on the widget. And there are like 90 images. Well, 90 of those images have to load during the page load. That's bad.

Liz Stapleton [00:15:49]:
I actually have never made that mistake. I've made most of them, but that one I haven't done.

Grayson Bell [00:15:56]:
That's a real bad one. So we typically tell people here's a little trick that I'll tell people. If you really want those widgets on your site, here's what you do, is you put them on your site and then you take a screenshot of the widget and make it an image so it doesn't really change. But people don't know, like, people that are just new to your site don't know that. So then you put it down as just an image and not an actual, like, the widget. And then you just link it to your profile. You link it to your Pinterest profile or your Facebook profile, or your really? Instead of loading all these scripts and all this JavaScript and all this stuff for these widgets and all the images, you're just loading one image from your own site.

Liz Stapleton [00:16:39]:
Okay. Yeah.

Grayson Bell [00:16:40]:
So if you really have to have these but most of the time, once I show people the site speed differences from just taking those few items off, they're like, oh wow, so that's a big one. I'll say the other. Well, it could be related to site speed. But images don't take images from your phone and put it on your website. When we take a snapshot with an iPhone or an Android, you're talking like four to twelve megabytes in file size. These are big images. These could be like 3500 pixels wide by whatever the orientation is. And they're generally a lot of people just like to load those right up into WordPress and just keep on going. That's not a good idea. The reason is that your site now has to load these bad boys. And if you've ever gone to a site and you're sitting there watching and you're seeing the image, slowly load it's because it's huge. It's just massive. So what you want to do is you want to put it in some program. Some people use photoshop. There's a free one that's like Photoshop is called GIMP. I use pickmonkey. Some people use Canva, doesn't matter. Resize these bad boys down and get them to a size that makes sense for you. Some people, if you want portrait, make a size that works for you. If you want landscape, make that size. And then I typically run mine through short pixel to compress. So a lot of times you can get an image that even if resize, might be 500 KB in size. And you want to try to aim for 150 or less. 150 KB or less? 100 and less if you can get it. Because here's the caveat. Every page that you have on your site, you want to have it to be less than two megabytes in full size. That's every element loading on the page. And if you want to know a tool to check that, you can go to tools. Pingdom Pingdom.com. Tools.Pingdom.com. It'll give you a load time. That load time is mostly BS, but it'll give you the full page size. So this is really good to check some of your popular posts. It's really good to check your home page and where people are kind of going. So run that through. You want to be two megabytes or less. The smaller it is, the better. Because here's the deal. Everyone's going on mobile these days. We're mobile friendly, we're mobile first. There are only a couple of sites that I've ever been across that really had more desktop users than they had mobile. So you're talking about someone on a mobile network trying to load a 1012. I've seen up to 60 megabyte pages. I was blown away when I saw the 60 megabyte page. I was like, well, no wonder why it's slow.

Liz Stapleton [00:19:38]:
I'm like, what are all mine?

Grayson Bell [00:19:43]:
You would know if it was 60 megabytes. You'd be sitting there like, anything on here? And so the smaller it is, the faster it's going to load. So you want to try to get everything below two megabytes. A lot of people aim for one and less. That can get really hard, especially for recipe blogger. I know there's a lot of them out there. It can be really hard when you have high quality Pinterest images.

Liz Stapleton [00:20:07]:
Yeah.

Grayson Bell [00:20:08]:
So that could be a little bit difficult, but just never upload them from your phone or upload them from a stock photography site. Like deposit photos. Don't just take it and just throw it up there. It's going to be the worst experience you can ever have because you'll have to go fix all of them later down the road. Another thing that I will say, and that's a lot of stuff that's kind of like shared, it does not matter the number of plugins that you have on your site. The number is irrelevant.

Liz Stapleton [00:20:41]:
Plugin itself?

Grayson Bell [00:20:42]:
Yes. There is no magical number. If you're doing 40, don't go running and going like and just adding plugins after plugin after plugin. Because a lot of times what people do is they start duplicating functionality and they'll all be active. That's a problem. But if you need those plugins to run your site, run them. Like one of my sites has over 65 active plugins on it because it has ecommerce on there. And when you start getting Ecommerce, you have to like text and all this other kind of stuff. The thing is that not every plugin runs on the front end. It just is an admin type thing. So it only affects the back end. So the number of plugins is really irrelevant. I see a lot of information out there that's like, you got to keep it below 20 or ten, which is.

Liz Stapleton [00:21:31]:
Probably a good rule of thumb, but it kind of depends on what plugins you're using because you could have 20. But if one of them is Jetpack, which takes a lot of space, so it kind of depends which that was actually one of the questions I also wanted to ask you is how do you kind of evaluate your plugins? Know what's good, decide what to use?

Grayson Bell [00:21:54]:
So looking at what's good, typically I say, you know, go in a Facebook group and ask some people, see what they use, and then go check the WordPress repository and see the number of downloads when it was last updated, and check the ratings. They all have ratings on there. So that's a good way to see it. And if you're really concerned about something, install it, check it out, see how your site runs and kind of go from there without just like experience. It's kind of just hard to go like, this is the best plugin.

Liz Stapleton [00:22:33]:
Yeah. And remember to clear your cache so.

Grayson Bell [00:22:35]:
That you can actually see yes, cache. A lot of people forget that. So one of the things that we use all the time is in Google Chrome. It's incognito, it's cashless browser, no cookies. Safari, it's private browsing. And I think Firefox is also private and I think Edge, but I don't really know anybody that uses Edge.

Liz Stapleton [00:22:55]:
I didn't know what that was.

Grayson Bell [00:22:57]:
That was the new version of Internet Explorer.

Liz Stapleton [00:23:00]:
Oh, that's right. I think I did read something about that. Okay. Windows, I think, but yeah, incognito window, for sure. Because I remember the first time I had a caching issue, it turned out like I had six weeks of content that wasn't pulling in, just wasn't showing up my blog feed. And I was like, had someone be like, what post are you talking about? I don't see it here. And I was like and then I went to an incognito and I was.

Grayson Bell [00:23:24]:
Like, oh, yeah, caching is probably the number one issue that we come across, okay. Because browsers cache some crazy stuff, and we're all doing I have right now 86 tabs open across two browsers. I have 86 tabs open.

Liz Stapleton [00:23:46]:
Wow, you're worse than me.

Grayson Bell [00:23:48]:
Well, that's only two browsers. I have a Firefox browser up, too, that has a couple on there. Yeah, I'm pretty bad. I'm pretty bad. But caching can be pretty bad. So one thing I do recommend is, which a lot of people do not do, is actually log out of your WordPress site and shut it down every once in a while. Like, shut down your browser, log out of your WordPress site. Because what happens is those cookies can sometimes just get corrupted. They start building on top of each other, and then that's when people see issues, especially if a lot of times you have no idea if a host is updating something in the background and that's going to change something. Or you've updated plugins and you kind of just kind of just keep going, and you're like, well, this isn't working, right? Check incognito, log in, see if things are working. If things are working, clear your browser cache.

Liz Stapleton [00:24:44]:
No, that's a great point. Yeah. When that initial thing happened with the six weeks of content, when I was actually posting like twice a week, too, I was like, Are you kidding me? Right? What plugin do you typically recommend in terms of? Because otherwise I wouldn't know how to clear my cache if there wasn't, like, a little button that says Clear Cache.

Grayson Bell [00:25:09]:
For, um, well, typically most hosts don't like, they might have server caching, but your website needs other caching on top of it for a paid one. It's WP rocket all the way. We love that plugin for a free one. WP Fastest Cache is really good, really easy to set up, works really well. I do not recommend W three total cash. It takes a lot of knowledge in order to set that up correctly, and we typically see a lot of issues with it. So scrap it all together and go with a WP Fastest Cache. Or if you want to go paid, WP Rocket is the one that we use for customers and stuff like that. But, yeah, those will typically have something above that says, like, Clear Cache or Delete Cache or whatever, and you'll want to do that. They're supposed to clear when you post, but that doesn't always happen. Like technology.

Liz Stapleton [00:26:09]:
I usually get a notification, too. Anytime I add or deactivate a plugin or something, they're like, hey, you changed plugin stuff. Clear the cache.

Grayson Bell [00:26:16]:
Yeah, WP rocket does that. It's like, hey, something's changed. Clear the cache. And basically that just dumps the cache. So you kind of see everything and do what you did, but do it regularly. Check incognito, check your site incognito, see what other incognito you're seeing, what your readers see.

Liz Stapleton [00:26:35]:
Yeah, I also like to look at it incognito on mobile.

Grayson Bell [00:26:39]:
Yes, that is also possible and also a good way to do it so you can do the same thing in each incognito. I would say one of the besides the speed and the images and the hosting, the main thing that we see are just people just not running a backup before they do their updates and it comes crashing down. It's really hard to fix something when you don't have a backup. It takes a lot of time to rebuild. Be very careful with the page builders. I love a good page builder, but a page builder is for a page. Try not to use page builders in posts if at all possible, because over time and I've seen this happen more and more, you typically write more posts than pages. So if your page builder breaks or isn't compatible with the next version of WordPress or Gutenberg, all of your posts are now screwed up and you're going to have to go manually. Go fix them. A I'll say it. It's time to embrace Gutenberg. If you haven't already. Like, if you're scared of Gutenberg, don't be. It's really not that frightening. I've been using it for well over a year.

Liz Stapleton [00:28:01]:
Yeah, I finally made the switch. I'm still getting used to it. So quick question, because I totally did it today.

Grayson Bell [00:28:07]:
Quick answer.

Liz Stapleton [00:28:08]:
I had a really long blog post. I was like, you know what would be great? It's in gutenberg blocks. I translated it all, whatever. Convert to blocks, what's called. And I was like, you know, table contents would be awesome. So I did go to with Elementor and I just added table contents at the top.

Grayson Bell [00:28:25]:
Oh, that's fine.

Liz Stapleton [00:28:26]:
Cool. Okay. That's a page builder. So yeah, I'm new to Elementor too.

Grayson Bell [00:28:30]:
So I'm figuring out how much am there's. I know Gutenberg is adding a table of contents eventually. It actually might be in the plugin now. And the plugin is like a couple versions behind of what WordPress shows you. There's a lot more features in the plugin than there are on your actual WordPress. But yeah, table of contents are awesome. If you want just a plugin to do Table of Contents, easy table of Contents. Basically, it's just a short code and it'll pick up all of your you get to pick if you want it to pick up, like the H2, h3, or H4. Typically. You should not be using H4 unless you got some weird lists, but you basically can just put that short code right at the top and it'll just pick up all those it's really nice. Yoast also has some really nice they don't have table contents, but they have FAQs.

Liz Stapleton [00:29:25]:
Okay.

Grayson Bell [00:29:26]:
And one other structured element which is really nice for Google.

Liz Stapleton [00:29:30]:
Yeah.

Grayson Bell [00:29:31]:
If you do any FAQs and stuff like that, it'll structure all the schema appropriately. So that's really nice. If you use a it's just an extra block down the be. Don't be scared of gutenberg. Give it a try. If you have Classic Editor, the plugin there's a setting in there. So if you go to settings writing and then you'll see in there where it says allow users to switch hit. Yes. When you do that, it'll default to Classic, but then there'll be a little sidebar piece that says Switch to Block Editor. And block editor is gutenberg. So you can try it on new posts or you can just try it on like a draft post. It doesn't really matter. Just play with it a little bit. Most people, most not everybody, but most people, once they try it and get a hang of it, they really like.

Liz Stapleton [00:30:17]:
Yeah, yeah, no, I agree with that. It just takes a little bit of work. And I didn't manually went through all of my posts and converted them to blocks because I was like, you know what? Eventually this isn't going to work. That it's like Classic and it's going to blow something.

Grayson Bell [00:30:31]:
Well, yeah, they say that the Classic Editor block is going to stay around for a long time. I don't foresee that actually going away anytime soon, but if you're doing some content edits and it's in Classic block.

Liz Stapleton [00:30:46]:
Yeah, which is kind of what I did.

Grayson Bell [00:30:47]:
Click it and switch it. I think it's like two button clicks to blow that whole thing up into block. It's really nice.

Liz Stapleton [00:30:56]:
Yeah, because I was moving away from a certain page builder at the same time. So I was like, steep learning curve.

Grayson Bell [00:31:00]:
Let's move away from something and then.

Liz Stapleton [00:31:03]:
Not go back to what I knew before and try something new.

Grayson Bell [00:31:07]:
You're basically changing everything at one time.

Liz Stapleton [00:31:09]:
Yes, I'm a go getter like that.

Grayson Bell [00:31:13]:
You're jumping all in 100%.

Liz Stapleton [00:31:15]:
I am. And then like, my home page was hideous. And so for another session, I was like, oh, I have to redo my home page. It's hideous. It'll be a great example. And then we went there and I was like, oh, it's even worse than I thought. Images aren't working. This is awful. Great.

Grayson Bell [00:31:27]:
Yeah, it's a fun yeah.

Liz Stapleton [00:31:31]:
Okay, so you and your Facebook group and your blog and your courses are obviously all great resources, but if you are DIYing, if you're not a customer of Imark Interactive or another company also should totally be a company of customer of Imark Interactive.

Grayson Bell [00:31:47]:
Yes, you should.

Liz Stapleton [00:31:48]:
I'm not an affiliate, guys. I'm just like it's. Awesome.

Grayson Bell [00:31:52]:
Thank you.

Liz Stapleton [00:31:56]:
What are some good resources when you're DIYing this? Because I DIYed for a long time and I definitely screwed up a lot.

Grayson Bell [00:32:03]:
Well, YouTube could be your best friend. YouTube has so much stuff out there. Wpbeginner.com, really great. That site's been around for so long. They have so many. To be honest, there's a lot of paid courses out there and there's some good courses, but if you're trying to bootstrap this and get it together, I think YouTube is probably going to be your best friend. I have a free course that teaches you kind of the technical aspects of it. It's completely free. You don't have to pay anything that's at courses imarkinteractive.com. And it kind of teaches you how.

Liz Stapleton [00:32:50]:
To use WordPress, orients you to WordPress. Because I had zero clue when I was starting. It took me a long time to figure it out. It was before your course existed. So basically it's all your fault. It took me that long, but it took me six months to figure out how to do a drop down menu.

Grayson Bell [00:33:04]:
Oh, yeah, kidding.

Liz Stapleton [00:33:05]:
It's not hard. You just move it over. But there's nothing to tell you that that's true.

Grayson Bell [00:33:12]:
So WordPress is the most used CMS out there. But it is not easy. I'm not going to sugarcoat it. It's not easy. Anybody that tells you you'll have a blog in five minutes, yes, you can have a website in five minutes. There's nothing on it and it's not set up. So you could typically, if you sat down on a Saturday morning and worked all the way through Sunday, night. You could have a WordPress website done and live. Don't expect this to be like, I'm going to click a button. It's going to be over. Everything's going to be in there for you. It doesn't really happen that way now with the page builders and the themes. And it's a lot easier. When I started, everything was the same color. You could pick four different colors. Everything was the same layout. And if you didn't know how to code, nothing happened. It was just like an online diary. It's gone a long way. But don't feel discouraged when you can't get something immediately. Google it. Hit up YouTube. Get on Facebook groups. So many Facebook groups for blogs or.

Liz Stapleton [00:34:24]:
Blogging in general for this summit.

Grayson Bell [00:34:27]:
Yeah, and just ask questions. There's typically people like, I'm on a ton of Facebook groups and if I get tagged or if I'm around and I see it, I'll typically answer it for just like a question of like, what do I do here? Or why am I getting this error? It's a steep learning curve, but once you figure it out, typically you kind of just keep on moving. And I will say this, too many people focus too much on the design part first. Here's the thing. If people are coming to your mobile site, no one cares about the design. You need a logo and a menu and content. Content don't care about. Like, all this stuff could be changed at any point in time. I've seen people just harp on the design and they never launched it. It took like seven months to launch their site. And I'm like, you could have been pushing content and marketing that content. Because my philosophy is it's 20% creating, 80% marketing.

Liz Stapleton [00:35:33]:
Absolutely.

Grayson Bell [00:35:36]:
Most people do it. The opposite is they spend so much time on creating the content and they spend no time on marketing it, putting out social media, trying to get backlinks to it, none of that kind of stuff. And that's the complete wrong way of doing it if you want to succeed in this.

Liz Stapleton [00:35:54]:
And I would also say design is important, but I wouldn't make it the first thing you do because you're going to see a lot of other stuff. You're going to spend forever on the design and then like, two months later, be like, nope, just do something real basic and simple. Move on. Get content out. Chances are no one's looking at your site that much right now anyway. When you've got a handle on that and you're getting traffic, you can work on the design some more. You could even hire it out. And like you said, what the design looks like on mobile, totally different.

Grayson Bell [00:36:31]:
I see too many people getting stuck in it. I also see a lot of people going full all in and hiring designers for $4,000 sites and they have no traffic. And I'm like, this is a bit much. You don't have to go New York Times type stuff. You don't have to go that deep when you're first starting out. If you build it, they will come type scenario when your site is remember, you are a part of billions of other sites. I can't even remember the last time I think the last time I saw something, it was like four or 5 million blogs are started per day or something. It might be more than that, but like some astronomical and you're just one of them of the millions that are out there. So you have to fight for everything that you are going to get. It's a good fight, but it's a long fight. And blogger is a long term game. Don't expect explosions of traffic immediately. You might be able to do that on Pinterest, but for a Google type scenario, that doesn't really happen. But yeah, don't put out like a 1997 type site where it's looking like pretty bad, but don't spend hours and hours and hours trying to make sure that this color is perfect.

Liz Stapleton [00:37:44]:
It's never going to be perfect.

Grayson Bell [00:37:45]:
Pixels. Yeah. And don't be afraid of doing redesigns because I can't even tell you how many times I've redesigned one of my blogs. I think it's 18 or 19 over the past eight years.

Liz Stapleton [00:37:56]:
Yeah, maybe more tons. If you want a good laugh, go to was it the web archive?

Grayson Bell [00:38:03]:
Wayback Machine?

Liz Stapleton [00:38:04]:
Wayback machine. Yeah.

Grayson Bell [00:38:06]:
I love that.

Liz Stapleton [00:38:07]:
Yeah, if you put it in my very first blog, it was under different names. Less Debt, More Wine, My personal finance site was the first one and it was originally called Friday Night Shenanigans.

Grayson Bell [00:38:15]:
Yeah, I remember.

Liz Stapleton [00:38:16]:
And if you do Wayback Machine and look for if you want a good laugh at how terrible a website looks and you could probably do that with most of your bloggers if you're like, oh, it looks so bad. You're like, no, you're going to be ashamed of your first design, too. Don't worry about it. Move on.

Grayson Bell [00:38:31]:
Yeah, you should feel pretty lucky now. There's so many nice themes out there that can get you started looking good. When you and I started, wasn't really like that. It was either magazine type layout or basically like blog roll layout. That's all it was. And threw a logo up there and called it a day. I do love looking back at the Wayback Machine sometimes. It's really nice.

Liz Stapleton [00:38:54]:
It's good for a laugh, for sure. It's like, I do it and I'm like, oh, that's so bad.

Grayson Bell [00:39:02]:
It's pretty funny. I like it. One thing that I do want to mention, every site, every site that you have, it should have some type of security set up on it. I recommend WordPress. It's free. But a lot of people you do not realize the amount of hacking that happens in WordPress because WordPress is the most popular CMS in the world. So it gets brute force attacked often.

Liz Stapleton [00:39:26]:
Okay? Yeah.

Grayson Bell [00:39:27]:
So even just the simplest security setup like WordPress will help tremendously. And never, ever use the username admin. Never use it. It is still the most used admin username out there. It's utterly terrible and you will almost be guaranteed to get hacked if you use admin. That's one of the things that I dislike about our friends at Bluehost. When you use their WordPress installer, it uses admin as the username gotcha. So if you do use the Bluehost WordPress installer, please just go in. Once you log in for the first time, create a new admin user with a completely different username and password, log out of the admin that you just did, and then log into the new one. And then you can delete the admin user. It's a little complicated, but you're not allowed to change usernames in WordPress without knowing some.

Liz Stapleton [00:40:26]:
And then the other thing, I feel like when you're starting, and I'm sure there's people here that aren't just starting, but may have done, this is the default permalink structure in WordPress, which I got a WordPress for dummies book from the library when I started and so I actually did this right. But nice. The default permalink structure includes the date, right?

Grayson Bell [00:40:51]:
Well, actually it depends on the installer.

Liz Stapleton [00:40:54]:
Okay.

Grayson Bell [00:40:54]:
It depends on the installer they use. So it's funny, some of them actually include index PHP, then the date some of them will be the default Permalink structure, which is the database ID. Just a question mark, but yeah, typically it'll be Month and Name. Month and name. Or sometimes I see Day and Name and you just don't want dates in your URLs. So you want post name? So immediately, right when you get started, go in there and click it.

Liz Stapleton [00:41:31]:
You're going to have to redirect everything.

Grayson Bell [00:41:33]:
Yes. Do not do this if you've already started. So there is a sequence of events that you have to follow. If you've already started, you have to do a database backup first. Most important, then you have to do a redirect on the server. Now if you don't know how to do this, we do this fairly cheaply. But there's a site. I think if you just google yoast, permalink helper.

Liz Stapleton [00:42:01]:
Okay.

Grayson Bell [00:42:02]:
Yoast permalink helper. You can put in your domain.

Liz Stapleton [00:42:08]:
What.

Grayson Bell [00:42:08]:
Your current Permalink structure is and then you basically hit Go and it'll give you the redirect code to push it to postname it's only to push it to Post Name, though. So if you want to change it from Day and Name to Month and Name, which I don't know why you want to do that, it won't do that for you. But you can do that. And then you have to put that in what they call the HT Access file on your host. Now if you're not comfortable doing this, please do not edit this file.

Liz Stapleton [00:42:37]:
Have access to your Cpanel.

Grayson Bell [00:42:39]:
Yeah. Your Cpanel over. Some hosts don't even have Cpanel anymore. They use just FTP, which makes it a little bit harder. But if you do not know what you're doing, do not touch this site.

Liz Stapleton [00:42:51]:
Names, which is I'm sure, a similar process. I was like, I don't even want to I was like, Grayson, please.

Grayson Bell [00:42:57]:
Yeah, that is part of just some people, they just like learning so they can go in and go for it. But if you're going to go into Cpanel and edit the HT Access file, please just download it first before you edit it so you can re upload it again. If something gets messed up, then the.

Liz Stapleton [00:43:18]:
Site will only be down for the broken their site.

Grayson Bell [00:43:20]:
Yeah, we see that all the time. I'm like, well, did you take a backup of the file? No, we'll see. That would have just solved this completely. You could just re upload it. So taking a couple of seconds, right click it and see panel, hit Download and call it a day. But yeah, you have to do that. And then basically you go back into WordPress and you click into the Permalink section, hit Post Name, and then hit Update. And it'll basically update. And that new redirect code will basically force everybody from the old one to the new one. And you only have to do that if you've already been posting.

Liz Stapleton [00:44:00]:
And if you see big bloggers that have that in their permalink, it's probably because they've been there for forever and they were huge. But that makes a difference for SEO and different things.

Grayson Bell [00:44:10]:
Yeah. So if you've been around for a long, long time, which a lot of people have, I know a couple of people that still have dates in their URLs. They just don't want to rock the boat. They get really good traffic, and they just don't want to rock the boat. And that's completely understandable because making the change can rock the boat temporarily. Majority of the times it's a good change because really, though, it doesn't directly affect SEO with that, it gives you the ability to republish. And that is really where the SEO value is. You can republish without it changing the permal, the URL, because if you have dates and you republish, it switches the URL.

Liz Stapleton [00:44:52]:
Yeah. And then your old one doesn't work.

Grayson Bell [00:44:55]:
A lot of people just don't like.

Liz Stapleton [00:44:56]:
If you don't have time to come up with new content, and you're like, let me just quickly update an old post and republish that baby.

Grayson Bell [00:45:04]:
So I'll be completely upfront. My personal finance blog, I haven't written on it in over two years, and I just republish old content after changing it quite a bit. And the site still does good traffic, hasn't been hit by any of the Google algorithm updates, and still makes money. And I haven't added new content in two years. So republishing does have a good effect.

Liz Stapleton [00:45:31]:
Yeah. So helps keep it fresh. Yeah. My personal finance, I haven't even touched in really a year. I mean, not even republishing. So I need to go in and work.

Grayson Bell [00:45:40]:
Yeah, I don't do it that often. I'll go in maybe twice a year and be like, oh, it's Christmas time. Let's throw some holiday content up there. That's about it. There's nothing fancy. I typically like to try to republish the articles that do well in Google to tell Google, hey, this is still fresh, and if something changes in there, you want to make sure it's updated, because if it's still bringing traffic, takes you like, 10-15 minutes of your time.

Liz Stapleton [00:46:07]:
Totally.

Grayson Bell [00:46:08]:
Yeah.

Liz Stapleton [00:46:08]:
All right. Any final words for everyone?

Grayson Bell [00:46:14]:
Have fun. I think blogging is fun. Too many people take us so seriously that it becomes a job for them, and then they hate it. Don't get overwhelmed with all the technical stuff that happens in WordPress. It can be overwhelming. Go at a pace that's comfortable for you. Don't pull your hair out. Some of my friends that I know, they like to call ugly crying. If you're ugly crying over a problem in WordPress, you need to go step back and maybe go outside or go do something really enjoyable. Take some time away.

Liz Stapleton [00:46:55]:
It'll be here when you come back.

Grayson Bell [00:46:56]:
Yeah. You should not be crying over something that your blog is doing or something like that. So just have fun. Take your time. Blogging is a long game. I think Liz and I both know that people that were doing this in 2008, 2009, a lot of those people aren't around anymore. If you can have longevity and keep through the process, you're typically going to be a lot better off than others. Because I think the last time I saw the statistic, it was 50% of bloggers all burn out after the first six months.

Liz Stapleton [00:47:29]:
Yeah. I feel like if you make a.

Grayson Bell [00:47:31]:
Pass might be more.

Liz Stapleton [00:47:31]:
You're making it long term.

Grayson Bell [00:47:36]:
Treat your blog like a business from the beginning. Immediately from the beginning, treat it like a business. Don't treat it like a hobby. Because if you treat it like a hobby and you want it to be a business, you won't make the payments to gain knowledge. Or we see this a lot and somebody spent like 6 hours trying to fix something and then they gave up and paid us and we had it fixed in like 20 minutes. The minimal amount of still value your time, put an hourly rate on your time and still value it. If it's taking you 6 hours to do something where you can pay somebody to do it in so much less time and you can move on, don't be afraid to do that. Yes, it's money, but your time is still valuable. You're away from your family. Or some people like to do this on the side of their job.

Liz Stapleton [00:48:32]:
Life is about more than just blogging about life. You're supposed to live life some too.

Grayson Bell [00:48:37]:
100%. As you know, you can go down the blogging rabbit hole real quick and you end up coming out with cheetos on your shirt. Haven't been out of your basement for three days. Yeah, I checked the mail. I'm not going to lie. I do it sometimes. I work in my basement, so I have no idea besides looking at the clock. I have no idea if it's sunny outside. I have no idea if it's raining.

Liz Stapleton [00:49:03]:
Yeah, I hardly check the weather. I'm like, I don't go outside that often.

Grayson Bell [00:49:06]:
Yeah, go check the mail once in a while or like that. Don't be afraid of the technical worries. Everyone can get through it.

Liz Stapleton [00:49:18]:
Yeah. And definitely go to Imark interactive, the links below if you want to kind of receive updates and stuff on WordPress. And he's always on top of it if there's some sort of plugin, uh, been infected or whatever.

Grayson Bell [00:49:35]:
We're most active in our Facebook group blogging on Wordpress. Can you pay for WordPress groups now? I think they charge for those. And some people I don't. Mine's free. I don't know. We don't do that here nor there. It's free, but we try to keep the people in there. I vet every person that comes in there, so I don't let spammers get in my group. Sometimes they'll get by me. I try to look at every profile, but it's hard. But my group is pretty clean in that regard. People will flag it, and I'll get them out really quick. So I'll post updates in there if I see plugin issues.

Liz Stapleton [00:50:17]:
I think the link to your Facebook group because I think it's in this page, but if you take the free.

Grayson Bell [00:50:22]:
Courses, too yes, it's all over there. I think in every module, it's like, hey, have you joined the Facebook group yet? Definitely recommend it. It's the easiest way for me to communicate with everybody as quickly as possible because we all love our Facebook.

Liz Stapleton [00:50:41]:
Yeah, honestly, I've been on it since 2005.

Grayson Bell [00:50:45]:
Yeah, I remember when I had to use my college email to get on there. That's when it was just, like, a nicer AOL instant.

Liz Stapleton [00:50:58]:
It was great because I went to school in Massachusetts, right? So all the Massachusetts schools were on real early, and it had, like, your classes on there, so then you could see who was in your classes. It was the Facebook. And you'd be like, hey, you want to get together and work on this problem set? It was so much less creepy then.

Grayson Bell [00:51:15]:
Yeah, it was so much less creepy. Weren't little kids on there? Weren't your parents on there?

Liz Stapleton [00:51:20]:
You were limited to, like, seven?

Grayson Bell [00:51:25]:
Yeah, it was so much better back then. There were no ads.

Liz Stapleton [00:51:33]:
All right, Grayson, thank you so much for taking the time. I hope everyone learned a ton some great information. And just thank you for your generosity and your time.

Grayson Bell [00:51:42]:
Oh, you're most welcome. I had a pleasure doing it.

**Transcript:**
[00:00:09.460] - Liz Stapleton, Summit Host
We're here today with Grayson Bell, who was one of our fantastic speakers last year. I think he had the most upvoted talk last year, most popular talk. I forget the exact language. I should really know what it was, it was my Summit. But he's awesome. He's a WordPress guru. Grayson, thank you so much for agreeing to do this again. I know I hounded you.

[00:00:25.980] - Grayson Bell, imarkinteractive.com
Ah, you're welcome. It's, it's my pleasure. And I believe you are correct. The most up. I'll take it.

[00:00:31.570] - Liz
So today we're going to be talking about site speed because it is a huge thing, I feel like Google focuses on it more and more. I say Google, but because it's really the search engine we're all talking about when we say search engine optimization. So what are some of the, you know, one of the things I want to touch on or ask you about is the role page builders and theme's play into site speed. And if you can kind of tell us mistakes made there.

[00:00:53.530] - Grayson
Yeah.

[00:00:53.890] - Grayson
So, you know, the huge benefits of WordPress is that you can use anything to build your site. One tool will work for somebody. It won't work for somebody else. Page builders like Elementor or Divi and others, they're great to give somebody a drag and drop type of setup, but they do come at a cost for site speed. It was, we're building a sites speed course, and it was actually eye opening because I actually use Elementor on our site just to make some landing pages and stuff like that.

[00:01:22.300] - Grayson
There was one time I was just testing it. I took the the page that I built in Elementor and I, and I put it, just in Gutenburg, the default editor with a plug in called Kaden's Blocks, which just kind of extends the editor. It's free. It's a really good extra blocks, I guess you call it, extender. Just has some extra things and stuff like that. And it was amazing with no optimization. It was it went the page went from like fifty five in Google's page speed insights to like a ninety five.

[00:01:54.430] - Grayson
I mean just, just with that. And it took, I mean that page was pretty easy because it was just a simple FAQ, you know.

[00:02:00.490] - Grayson
But that's really like it was eye open. I kind of knew the impact of Elementor. We do a lot of site speed optimizations.

[00:02:08.140] - Liz
Yeah.

[00:02:08.710] - Grayson
And the thing about it is, is you have to really gauge the ROI for yourself.

[00:02:14.380] - Grayson
Right? Like if you want to create some landing pages and you don't have the time to try to finagle Gutenberg.

[00:02:21.670] - Liz
Yeah.

[00:02:21.970] - Grayson
Use a page builder. It's OK.

[00:02:23.920] - Grayson
Yeah, but I wouldn't use it to build your entire site. That's where a lot of people are getting stuck right now, is they're using ElementorPro or even Divi to build all of the elements, headers, footers, sidebars, all this kind of stuff. This just adds a ton of extra CSS and JavaScript to your page. And those are two of the biggest things that cause slowdowns and page speed. So use it sparingly if you want to use it.

[00:02:50.800] - Grayson
I think Gutenberg is slowly getting extended much better and making it easier to build pages with it.

[00:02:57.610] - Grayson
But page builders still have their place. Themes on the other hand, goodness gracious there...

[00:03:06.670] - Liz
I know there's a million out there, but..

[00:03:08.330] - Grayson
I mean, if you go to if you go to if you go to like Theme Forest and you find these themes that say they have like six hundred and fifty demos as a part of it, run away and run away quickly when you have something like that, it looks visually appealing. But these things are utterly terrible for speed. They usually include tons of sliders. Everything is built with a page builder, all that kind of stuff.

[00:03:30.040] - Grayson
So you have to you really have to come up with a happy medium between design and speed.

[00:03:36.910] - Grayson
There are a couple of designers that I know that can do both, but you're going to pay a lot of money for a site like that.

[00:03:43.870] - Grayson
It's not like you're going to just take a theme and go like I'm going through a caching plugin and it'll fix it all. It's not really true. There's only a couple of themes that we actually even use these days. Kadence is one of them, which is free, Astra also free, Generate Press free, some Genesis Power themes, Child themes excuse me.

[00:04:06.400] - Grayson
Genesis is a framework, all of these have paid add ons that you can get extra features and stuff like that. But really we're seeing lately that most people are going minimalistic in their pages design and then really it kind of makes sense because you think about it, most people are mobile now like for ours I think 70 percent of the people that come to our site is mobile. So really all these grandiose designs don't really show up well on mobile. A lot of times you have to remove some things and stuff like that.

[00:04:33.970] - Grayson
So these people that are paying thousands and thousands of dollars for a like a beautiful looking desktop site, you don't really get to see all that on mobile. And people don't really care.

[00:04:44.050] - Liz
Yeah,

[00:04:44.920] - Grayson
You know, people want to get, they're, they're for the content. They want whatever they're getting there, maybe a printable whatever it is.

[00:04:49.990] - Liz
Yeah.

[00:04:50.560] - Grayson
That's just what they want. And I think people are finally starting to realize that design, although it has its place, it's not nearly as important as getting people what they want.

[00:05:00.460] - Liz
Yeah.

[00:05:00.910] - Grayson
Quickly, I mean, look at Google site. It's as simple as it can be, really. Theme's if you have a really good theme, that's like the framework, that's like the foundation to your house, if you have a really good foundation, you can build upon it and have a really nice house or website.

[00:05:17.490] - Grayson
So that's kind of how I look at it.

[00:05:19.140] - Grayson
If you have a really poorly coded one, you're just going to run into issues. Like it's, you can't really fix it. You just have to put bandaids on it until you move.

[00:05:30.420] - Liz
Yeah. And I will say as a side note, because I am one of your monthly WordPress support customers, is that you include access to some premium themes.

[00:05:40.260] - Grayson
We do. We do. And I think we're actually going to start Kadence as well. I think we're going to be adding Kadence here soon as well.

[00:05:47.780] - Liz
I don't know, I've been pretty happy with Generate Press since I since I got..

[00:05:50.370] - Grayson
No,I love Generate Press, Generate Press is awesome Kadence is like the new person on the new kid on the block. And we're actually testing it. And I really like it because it really extends Gutenberg very well.

[00:06:02.130] - Grayson
But the new version of Generate Press, I think it's 3.0, also does a very good job. But it's more it's a little bit more advanced for for General Press if you want to do some other things.

[00:06:14.340] - Grayson
But it's a great, very light theme.

[00:06:16.950] - Liz
So what are sort of the besides, like theme and page builders, what are some common mistakes you see people make? I know images is, is one, caching. What?

[00:06:27.720] - Grayson
Yeah. So images is probably priority number one that we see. I think we, we might have talked about in the last time we had.

[00:06:35.220] - Liz
We did a little bit. Yeah.

[00:06:35.970] - Grayson
Yeah. That's really the biggest because people just take images from their phone and they just slap them right into WordPress and that's a no, no. You are expecting somebody that is trying to load this big ol' image. It's just one element has to load all the other elements as well. So you want to do some proper optimization of your images up front...

[00:06:56.160] - Liz
Before you load them onto your site

[00:06:57.540] - Grayson
Yes, before you load them on their site.

[00:06:59.190] - Grayson
I typically recommend that, but if you already have a ton of stuff on your site, then you can use a plug in like ShortPixel to optimize what you've already put on there. It's a paid, it's a paid plug in. It's technically free, but it's really paid  because you have to buy credits for it. But yeah,

[00:07:15.780] - Liz
It's super affordable though.

[00:07:15.780] - Grayson
It's Yeah. It's super cheap. Yeah.

[00:07:20.080] - Liz
Occasionally they do lifetime stuff.

[00:07:22.530] - Grayson
Yeah. Yeah. So yeah. Appsumo does some lifetime stuff sometimes but that's a way to do it if you have a ton of images.

[00:07:30.930] - Grayson
But really and on top of that people have really started putting way too many images in posts. I know that people love to get like all the side shots and really it's like a food blogger type thing.

[00:07:45.300] - Grayson
Food bloggers feel...

[00:07:45.960] - Liz
Like there's certain niches where it's kind of required.

[00:07:48.920] - Grayson
Yeah, like you have to, but I was on like this, it was like this SEO for bloggers webinar and they made a really good point.

[00:07:56.550] - Grayson
You don't need to give everybody every angle of a shot, give them, you know, maybe four or five. Because the problem is, is that break... You're not breaking....

[00:08:05.910] - Grayson
You're breaking up things too much in text with images and they can't get the content they're looking for. Most people in a recipe world are looking for the recipe.

[00:08:15.000] - Grayson
Yeah, they don't need thirty seven process shots.

[00:08:17.640] - Liz
I mean we know they have to write that stuff for Google, but...

[00:08:18.630] - Grayson
They don't need thirty seven process images and going like, oh this is exactly how you do it.

[00:08:24.750] - Grayson
And that was like really eye opening because these people, that's all they focus on is like food bloggers, but it also kind of works in the DIY niche. You don't need all of those process shots, pick ones that make sense, but you don't need a left, right, center upward downward. You don't need.

[00:08:39.540] - Liz
Yeah, what about video then in that sense? You know?.

[00:08:42.360] - Grayson
Yeah. So video is great. Yeah. So great video, was great in regards to 1. It's really good for SEO, but 2. It also keeps you on your page longer. The caveat to that, if you just embed YouTube video from somewhere else, that really has an impact on site speed, even though YouTube is technically pretty fast, it has to, it has to load all those assets up before it gives it off. So there are some really nice plug ins that can lazy load video.

[00:09:11.610] - Grayson
I think lazy load for video is one of them and that's free. Basically what it does if you use if you take an embed code from YouTube, use Gutenberg and you put it in like a YouTube block, it will lazy load that.

[00:09:23.880] - Liz
Basically it won't load the assets until someone's I think scrolls down to the spot.

[00:09:28.950] - Grayson
Yeah, it's like 50 or 100 pixels above it. It'll start loading those those items. So basically the first view of the site is not like slowed down by those things. But video, very good to have. I think it's an all around good idea if you're going to, if you do YouTube videos. Yeah. But they do have an impact so you really do have to lazy load them.

[00:09:50.790] - Grayson
Another item, plug ins.

[00:09:52.920] - Grayson
When I say that...

[00:09:53.980] - Liz
I remember when you were like, seriously Liz?

[00:09:55.920] - Grayson
Yeah. When I say plug ins, what I mean is a there's a common misconception that the number of plug ins affects the speed. That's not technically true. It's what they, it's, it's what they do, not, how many you have. So you can have a fast site with 50, 60 plug ins, as long as they're well coded and stuff like that, especially if you're thinking about e-commerce and something like that, you're going to need.

[00:10:18.600] - Grayson
And not every plugin affects the front end. They only load when you run it back and cut things so you can have, use the number of plug ins that you need to get the features that you want.

[00:10:29.460] - Grayson
Like that's what WordPress is about, right? The thing is, most people double up or triple up on the same type of plug in. We see it with caching plug ins. We see like six or seven backup plug ins. We see multiple image optimization plug ins, like and then you just have plug ins that haven't been updated in six or seven years. It's probably time to get rid of those.

[00:10:50.820] - Grayson
Like there's a fine line between knowing that a plug and still kind of works, even though it hasn't been updated in a while. But like six or seven years is a long time. You probably should just dump that, time to get rid of that. We do a lot of plug in audits and that's typically what we find are really outdated plug ins that are never going to be updated again. And really those affect the site not being able to run on the latest version of PHP or the new version of WordPress 5.5.1, which it is right now.

[00:11:20.180] - Liz
I have no idea what version is. I just let you take care of it.

[00:11:23.760] - Grayson
Yeah, I mean, the new version is 5.5.1, but PHP is 7.4 and almost every host has it now. I think, I think everyone

[00:11:34.380] - Liz
And when this airs, it might be different really.

[00:11:36.660] - Grayson
If you're going to do like a plug in audit, you really want to just look to see what you need or do, are you using all of those things?

[00:11:43.830] - Grayson
A good way to tell is, you know, is just deactivate it and go look at your site like, you know, like a reader would.

[00:11:51.000] - Grayson
If you, if you don't, if you..

[00:11:52.800] - Liz
Which is something you should do occasionally anyway, I think a lot of us forget sometimes to actually go look in an incognito window. I had a period where for six weeks my posts weren't showing to people, but I would see them and I didn't know it until, you know, and it was like a caching issue and it got fixed quickly.

[00:12:09.060] - Grayson
That's definitely a big one. I definitely would recommend that. Just I mean, even if it's another browser that you don't use regularly, Incognito or another browser, just open it up.

[00:12:17.640] - Grayson
That also, because here's the thing, you are not typically cached as an admin, so you are most likely going to see things slower as well because you are an uncashed visitor when you're already logged in. So your readers might see something much faster. And that's typically what we see is a lot of people are like, oh, you know, I didn't even know this was broken. I'm like, did you ever check your site on your phone or something else?

[00:12:43.200] - Grayson
Just check it when you're not logged in,

[00:12:44.970] - Liz
Like create like a recurring task. And whatever your project management tool, like every week or every other week or once a month, go in and do a solid, like a look around of your site to see if something's broken.

[00:12:54.810] - Grayson
Yeah, just just look around. I mean, it works out pretty well. So like do that when you're when you want to look over plug ins and see what you need outside of plug ins. I think the other big factor are external, just external elements.

[00:13:07.830] - Grayson
A lot of people put on a bunch of tracking scripts, things like heat map testing, big ones like Instagram feeds, Pinterest feeds, Facebook widgets.

[00:13:18.990] - Grayson
You know, we found that I think people get a false sense that those are providing them some type of benefit, because really, if you think about it, what you're doing is you're taking somebody off your site that you can control, either make them a visitor, make them a subscriber.

[00:13:34.110] - Liz
You have affiliate links or products links directly on there

[00:13:35.920] - Grayson
Sell them something you're taking to somewhere, one that you can't control you've now lost them to. This what happens, you're going to push somebody to Facebook and you think they're going to come right back? No, they're going to go down in the in

[00:13:46.920] - Liz
The Facebook rabbit hole

[00:13:48.090] - Grayson
Deep hole of Facebook or Instagram. They're not going to just check, like, two images and then come back to your site. That just doesn't happen. I mean, they're going to leave and they're going to be gone.

[00:13:57.870] - Grayson
So really, those items don't really increase your visitor count. And really, it's very hard to make money that way. Like, you can't it's not a it's not a money.

[00:14:05.430] - Grayson
You can't monetize those platforms as well as you can monetize your own stuff.

[00:14:09.390] - Grayson
Yeah. So we just say, hey, just get rid of them. You don't need them. And most people who do Instagram feeds, if you think about it when they're on mobile, those are all the way down the bottom.

[00:14:18.450] - Grayson
Who even goes down the footer anymore?

[00:14:21.210] - Grayson
It just, it just really doesn't happen. Most people go to

[00:14:24.300] - Liz
Unless they're specifically looking for something that's traditionally in the footer. They're not going there.

[00:14:27.990] - Grayson
Yeah, like, yeah, that's rare.

[00:14:29.970] - Grayson
It might be really only bloggers, I think, go down in the footer these days,

[00:14:33.750] - Liz
They're like, where's the contact button, where's the legal button.

[00:14:36.390] - Grayson
Unless you're. Yeah. Unless you're looking for something specific, you just, people just don't go there, whenever they get the information that they're looking for. That could be at the top of the post middle or bottom or read the comments. They don't really typically go any further than that. Just get these things off of your site.

[00:14:51.390] - Grayson
But also, all these tracking scripts, ones that are really bad are email opt-ins. Typically when you're doing embedding from, let's say, Convertkit, Flowdesk, it doesn't matter which one you do. But if you're embedding these things, these all have to call to those servers to get the information.

[00:15:07.420] - Liz
You mean like their plug in?

[00:15:08.950] - Grayson
So the plug-in is typically better, yes, or you can use a plug in like like convertpro or mail opt in or something where it actually just connects to the API instead of having to pull all the JavaScript through. So basically, you're pulling it from your server instead of getting it from theirs. Those do have an impact. But again, when it comes down to site speed, it's basically an ROI for you. What makes sense?

[00:15:31.000] - Grayson
Don't just don't chase a score. Chase usability. What, what, you actually want your customers to get out of your site. Too many people, just chase the score.

[00:15:39.400] - Grayson
Newsflash, Google doesn't use the score that know

[00:15:44.710] - Liz
They're, what they're looking at how long the users on there, whether it's answering the question. Yeah, yeah. The speed plays a factor, but not everything. So a couple of follow up questions on that. So embeds from like email marketing, does the same kind of apply in terms of like embeds from sales tools, whether it be, you know, embedding like a Podia checkout or a Thrivecart checkout or something like that, does that kind of go along the same lines?

[00:16:11.950] - Grayson
Yeah, if you see the embed just be wrapped in basically it's a script wrapper. You might just see a script at the front and closing script. That's, that's going to be a third party external script.

[00:16:25.070] - Grayson
Again, if you're just doing it on one page or two pages, don't worry about that.

[00:16:30.850] - Grayson
But if that's something that's going to go in like your header and across the entire site, think about it for a little bit before you put it in the push elements that come out and push notifications.

[00:16:39.490] - Grayson
OK, those are those are terrible for for sites.

[00:16:43.420] - Grayson
They, they just have...

[00:16:46.170] - Liz
Do them on one page or sales page or something?

[00:16:47.980] - Liz
Yeah. I mean, I don't even really know how effective they are, to be honest. I know we add them for a lot of people and then like a couple of months later, we take them off just because it's hard to gauge how much money you make from pushing out those things to people's mobile phones.

[00:17:03.460] - Grayson
So, you know, really, you've got to, as again..

[00:17:07.600] - Liz
ROI

[00:17:07.670] - Grayson
You have to measure for your own your own purpose.

[00:17:11.170] - Liz
Are there any you'd recommend staying away from as they currently stand, knowing they could change?

[00:17:16.750] - Grayson
Themes?

[00:17:17.890] - Liz
Sure. Any and all?

[00:17:20.920] - Grayson
Avada, Enfold, uh and those are.

[00:17:25.610] - Liz
Yeah, I've heard Divi because like Divi is really hard to move away from.

[00:17:28.540] - Grayson
Well so is, so is Avada, so is enfold, so is Thrive Themes. I thought Thrive theme builder which now uses like basically their architect thing.

[00:17:38.860] - Grayson
Because the thing is really only Elementor and Beaver Builder are the ones that don't use short codes everywhere.

[00:17:47.060] - Grayson
OK, so when you now the page won't look the same if you disable them, but at least the content will be readable by a human. When you disable Divi or Avada or stuff like that and you use their, their builders, you have basically all you'll see is short codes everywhere. So a person that can't read code will look at and be like, I'm just going to move on. This page is broken. Yeah. You don't have that same effect with Elementor or BeaverBuilder.

[00:18:15.710] - Grayson
That's why that's the only two page builders we recommend if you're going to use one. All right. There's a lot of things we don't recommend.

[00:18:22.870] - Liz
Yeah. Yeah, you can't go. Yeah, but I know I was just curious. One question I have is what difference does hosting make? In terms of your site speed?

[00:18:32.170] - Grayson
That's a pretty good one, so hosting is kind of like a people believe that the host is like one of the most important. It's really actually not. You can get a really great score on a host like Bluehost and stuff like that. But really, where it affects you the most is an initial connection speed, which does have a play in actual like real load times.

[00:18:52.870] - Grayson
Again, the score can be, scores can be manipulated pretty well if you're if you get really advanced with it, like you can do a really good manipulation of a score that doesn't really change how it really looks to somebody going to it. And when you have an initial connection speed that slow, you're going to feel it as a as a human being and actually like looking at the site and where it really comes into play in a big time as a blogger is when you're in the admin doing all your work, when you have a slow host, all of that stuff is just going to be slow.

[00:19:21.610] - Grayson
The saving, the moving from page to page, the editing, all that kind of stuff is slow.

[00:19:25.810] - Grayson
So if you think about it, you are now wasting more time sitting there trying to wait for to add a plug in, or a page to save. On a faster host and a host that may be in the cloud or has all the newer technology. Things are going to be a lot snappier, if you will. A lot snappier. I have I have a customer. We're moving over to a cloud host from Bluehost.

[00:19:50.380] - Grayson
And even though the score change, we were we were able to show her that her basically load time in Chrome was 50 percent better. So we dropped the load time in Chrome, especially in the admin by 50%. That's a big difference. And so you think about along with the theme framework, if you have a good host that has fast servers, you don't have to worry about that initial connection speed.

[00:20:17.050] - Grayson
You just got it. It's there. It's done. And elements can roll through a little bit quicker. Doesn't necessarily affect the score unless your host is utterly terrible and very slow. GoDaddy, one of the worst.

[00:20:32.800] - Liz
Tell us how you really feel.

[00:20:33.850] - Grayson
You can you can see that and feel that in score and then you can see that in the scores. But it's really a real load time for people is where hosting comes into play.

[00:20:44.020] - Liz
So we keep talking about score and some people may not realize, but that is what you're kind of referencing when you say that. So let's take a second to explain that.

[00:20:53.770] - Grayson
Yeah.

[00:20:54.250] - Liz
For those that may not know.

[00:20:55.600] - Grayson
So there are multiple testing tools, but really most people, when they talk about site speed score, it's a Google Page Speed Insight's, which uses their lighthouse system.

[00:21:07.690] - Grayson
So basically they've created this score. And this is it's been around for a while, but they've evolved it over time to add different elements into it. It's out of a out of a hundred and basically 100 out of 100 is like you have the best optimization that you possibly can.

[00:21:23.530] - Liz
You probably have nothing on your site.

[00:21:24.670] - Grayson
And yeah, you can't get one hundred at one hundred if you have like literally nothing on the site.

[00:21:29.530] - Liz
Yeah.

[00:21:30.940] - Grayson
But there's so basically they put it in three brackets, red, orange and green along with a number. And I can't remember, I think, I think red goes up to thirty five from thirty five to seventy or excuse me 80 and then 90 and above is green. We get a lot of people there like I want my site to be green which is ninety and above. And what these, what these scores are basically just how well you have optimized based off of what Google thinks, what Google thinks a great optimization techniques are.

[00:22:06.670] - Liz
Yeah.

[00:22:07.270] - Grayson
Again, these scores can be manipulated by doing some really advanced coding, but that doesn't really mean that your site is fast persay. It's just saying, hey, it looks like it is.

[00:22:17.690] - Liz
Yeah.

[00:22:19.710] - Grayson
Yeah. So really, I tell people. I think it's always good to have, you can use that as a guide and Google Page Speed Insights does really well to tell you what's what's causing you problems.

[00:22:33.270] - Liz
Yeah.

[00:22:34.140] - Grayson
Not everything is fixable. Google even flags its own Google analytics scripts. So, like, you have to just come up with going. You just have to accept it. Yeah, you have to accept it. Use common sense. Some people will go to the extreme to get in that green and really

[00:22:50.040] - Liz
To the detriment of their site and what they're actually trying to do.

[00:22:52.200] - Grayson
Yeah. They start stripping everything away and all that kind of stuff. Just focusing on this score.

[00:22:57.240] - Grayson
And that's where I usually tell people, you know, like, you're literally just wasting time. I think I was looking through this Facebook thread the other day and somebody spent six hours trying to get their score from a eighty eight to a 90, like six hours.

[00:23:10.890] - Grayson
That little difference of a jump does nothing like there is literally no difference in site speed, real site speed from a 88 to a 90 like nothing, like you just wasted six, let's say

[00:23:22.650] - Liz
From a 40 to a 90, sure, spend six hours.

[00:23:25.500] - Grayson
Yeah.

[00:23:25.850] - Grayson
Like there's a difference, you know, like it's you have to think about your time, you know, like as a service provider, if I was going to spend six hours to do a two point jump, that would be a huge waste of time.

[00:23:37.350] - Liz
Yeah.

[00:23:38.040] - Grayson
And you know, like that's billable hours that I've now lost just to, just to do that, just to chase an arbitrary number. So...

[00:23:45.120] - Liz
It's also something because I feel like that the person that did that is what we would call a perfectionist. Yep. Which is something that holds a lot of bloggers back, like just you just done is better than perfect. You can always change things later like move on.

[00:23:58.480] - Grayson
Yeah. Nothing is ever done. Nothing is ever done on your blog. It's kind of like, I mean if you if you have ever owned a house, they tell you whenever you're done fixing it up is when you sell it, you know, like that's is what it is. Nothing is ever done. And when you actually get to that point, you sell it. It's the same thing with a blog. The design will never be done. You know, a perfect blog post will never be done.

[00:24:21.150] - Grayson
Like it's literally an evolving like creature that you have to just keep going and going and going. Don't be a perfectionist when it comes to site speed. Don't be greedy when it comes to site speed. Literally, we've done well over a thousand optimizations in the past year. And I can tell you unequivocally that moving from a 70 to a 90 does nothing for you in regards to it affecting the way that Google ranks your site. You're not going to get any extra traffic.

[00:24:52.650] - Grayson
Now, maybe it'll be slightly faster for a reader and that might please them. But the ROI that you get for moving from a 70 to a 90 is minimal. I typically say, hey, if you're in the red, move it up, let's get it in, let's get in the orange. Because really, orange is more than acceptable, because if you think about orange goes all the way up to eighty nine.

[00:25:14.760] - Liz
Yeah.

[00:25:15.150] - Grayson
And like, like just focus on doing, and that's the thing, too many people focus on thinking that Google is going to rank them better when their speed is fast. And that's not technically true. And that actually came out in a webmaster video on YouTube and said the same thing. What, what speed does is it gives the reader a better experience. And that in turn gives you better conversions, more money, better onload like they stay on their, a lower bounce rate.

[00:25:46.200] - Grayson
All these things then affect Google's. Site speed is technically what they call a tiebreaker. So that means if you are one and two and your number two and everything else is equal, everything else out of there are 200 plus ranking things. If you are slightly faster, you would leapfrog up to number one, focus in on it for a reader. That's where you want to get it. It doesn't matter. Don't think about what Google wants

[00:26:11.070] - Liz
Don't write for algorithms, write for people.

[00:26:13.680] - Grayson
Yes. And I think a lot of people mess that up because they do. They focus purely on keyword research and used Yoast one hundred percent saying like you need you know, you're not doing a passive voice. Avoid all of this kind of stuff we've gotten away from writing how humans read.

[00:26:30.000] - Grayson
And actually Google's got a lot smarter with realizing that people have gone away from writing.

[00:26:30.000] - Grayson
And so they're like, it's common, it's common misconceptions and stuff that we actually put in our course specifically about that information and kind of showing, you know, the differences and stuff like that. But just focus on optimizing the whole picture. That's what you should be doing.

[00:26:49.200] - Liz
So one last question, because I think we're going to run out of time, ads?

[00:26:53.010] - Grayson
It's OK. I'll try. I'll do this quickly.

[00:26:55.380] - Liz
That's like my question. Ads, ads?

[00:26:57.870] - Grayson
All right.

[00:26:58.170] - Grayson
So ads do have an impact on site speed. There are services, are companies that do well with optimizing them, Mediavine, Adthrive. Those are the two that really do a really good job with optimizing their ads for mobile and desktop. And really, when I say optimizing all it is, is a way to show you that the score is higher.

[00:27:22.260] - Grayson
I actually did. I actually did it today for a customer, because when you when you do the ad optimization through AdThrive or Mediavine, often it can have an impact on your RPM or your revenue. It can have a, it could be slight, but for some niches, it's really big. They lose 25, 30 percent. And that's a lot of money. Yeah, but really in the in the grand scheme of things. So today I had one site showing seventeen on mobile.

[00:27:52.100] - Grayson
You defer the ads or optimize the ads, it goes up to about 70. That's that big of a jump. Yeah. Just deferring ads and what different ads means is basically ads don't load in the first view.

[00:28:02.690] - Liz
It's like lazy loading them.

[00:28:03.800] - Grayson
Yeah it's lazy loading them. It doesn't go through their auction, which that's where it creates all the crazy calls out to all these servers.

[00:28:10.520] - Grayson
But when you actually load the site and do a speed test on it, which is, you can do inside of chrome, there was literally a 0.1 second difference between it with ads and without ads.0.1. Yeah, that was, that was it, like it was it was 1.3 seconds without without ads and 1.4 seconds with ads.

[00:28:35.690] - Grayson
That was how fast the content,

[00:28:37.350] - Liz
And if it's going to be a twenty five percent change I just keep the...

[00:28:40.250] - Grayson
Yeah. So that's where like and and that's the thing.

[00:28:43.580] - Grayson
Those are you have to realize that because if you're, if you're chasing a score you're going to go defer the ads. And for a lot of people it doesn't affect R.P.M. These are just things that you have to test. Yeah, but for Adsense, Monumetric, ezoic, shemedia, media.net, all these other things.

[00:29:01.820] - Liz
Defer em.

[00:29:03.230] - Grayson
You can't they don't provide it.

[00:29:05.000] - Grayson
They don't provide it, in our site speed course, we actually built a couple of scripts that will do it for you. We did it for the monumetric, Adsense, and I believe shemedia. Just because customers have asked for it. Ezoic. You can't do anything with it because they run all their stuff through their own servers and CDN and all that kind of stuff.

[00:29:22.800] - Liz
Yeah.

[00:29:23.390] - Grayson
And they will charge you. I think it's twenty dollars per month if you want to do their fast, fast ads or something like that. Yes. It's crazy amount of money and I disagree with it. In our course we're showing some ways that you can actually defer them I think you can actually now in the newer version of WpRocket, you can kind of come up with a way to defer these ads just with WpRocket.

[00:29:46.650] - Grayson
So we're, we're putting that in the course as well after we do some more testing. We've done it with the three. But really the two networks that are the best out there are Mediavine and AdThrive. But they have a high threshold. And I think what, Mediavine just push theirs to a 50,000?

[00:30:02.750] - Liz
50,000 session's not pageviews.

[00:30:04.430] - Grayson
Sessions. Yeah. So you're just right.

[00:30:06.020] - Liz
AdThrive is 100,000 pageviews.

[00:30:07.700] - Grayson
Yeah. So AdThrive hasn't changed in a while. But the other ones I think come in at 10,000. Either way, you just have to, it's all about testing. Ads will have an effect, it really depends on how well they do their code and how well they load all these ads. Sometimes it will be to a detriment. I don't know if you've ever been on a website, especially on mobile, where you have ads running and then video, videos start rolling and stuff, and it destroys like your phone's processor.

[00:30:38.050] - Grayson
I understand the point of having ads because you need to make money, especially for a lot of niches. They don't have affiliate marketing, but goodness gracious, you are destroying the user experience, pushing all this stuff in at one time. You got pop ups going, you have push engage happening, you know, like all this kind of stuff.

[00:30:54.040] - Liz
Like, yeah, so so think about user experience, what you want user experience, users to experience, as well as what you're trying to accomplish, because chasing the score to the point where you're not accomplishing your goal of getting subscribers or sales or affiliate clicks or whatever.

[00:31:09.730] - Grayson
Yep.

[00:31:10.270] - Liz
Like what's the point? Oh your sites faster? It ranks better? Great, it doesn't make any money. So the fact that you have more traffic, is that helping you?

[00:31:17.110] - Grayson
I would say really the only, only where it works, you want like the fastest site possible is probably affiliate where you're just doing affiliate links inside of content. There's no opt-ins, nothing else. It's basically just getting them there with that information and out. So your bounce rate will still be really high because you've achieved your goal. They've got them out to an affiliate link.

[00:31:38.500] - Grayson
So really, if you're not doing some all around strategy, which I don't think just doing a hundred percent affiliate is really a great idea for any business. Come up with a well-rounded strategy for whatever your site is. Just because one site does this doesn't mean you have to do it.

[00:31:50.950] - Liz
All right. Any final words before we sign off? I know they should absolutely check out your speed site course, we'll talk about that in a second. Any final words before we get to that?

[00:31:59.950] - Grayson
Just site speed in general. Don't don't make changes during your high traffic times.

[00:32:05.530] - Grayson
I think that's a really big one.

[00:32:07.330] - Grayson
A lot of people, you know, if you're really big in the fourth quarter or you start doing a lot of traffic, fourth quarter, please, please don't make the changes and do it when you're lower and slower.

[00:32:16.300] - Grayson
And, you know, if you are also really low, you don't have a lot of traffic, then you really don't have too much to worry about. You can just kind of roll right into it. But you don't also don't be afraid to make changes. This is what, this is what being on the web is about. It's about progressing and changing with the times. And just because the theme looks really great doesn't mean that it's well coded. One great tip that I will say is that look at the theme demo.

[00:32:40.870] - Grayson
Most places have a theme demo and run it through Google Pagespeed Insights and see what it does.

[00:32:45.790] - Liz
There you go.

[00:32:46.600] - Grayson
Don't worry about a like if you see something called like server, improve server response time, don't focus on that because that's not your server, that's theirs. But look at all the other things that come up. That will tell you how well a site is already optimized for you. So if it's poorly optimized, don't go for it.

[00:33:07.990] - Liz
Yeah.

[00:33:08.560] - Grayson
Move on.

[00:33:09.100] - Liz
All right. Yeah. So Grayson Bell, iMarkinteractive, as you can tell, he knows this stuff. Definitely check out his site speed course. I'm going to have to go check it out. The link to that is on the page. Anything else you want to say about it?

[00:33:22.060] - Grayson
I'm super excited about it. It's been something that's been in the works for a long time. We are constantly adding new stuff like even though it's not launched, I'm still adding more stuff and more stuff.

[00:33:33.670] - Liz
By the time this airs, it  will have launched.

[00:33:34.910] - Grayson
Yeah, yeah. By this time this airs, it will be launched. But there's just there's a lot of information there and I try to make it as easy as possible for you to follow. But if you don't know me, I'm very giving in the advice that I give and you'll have access to to me, my team in the Facebook group as well that, that comes with as a part of this course. So, you know, if you're worried about site speed, I would definitely recommend you check it out.

[00:34:03.190] - Grayson
It's at your own pace so you can just go your flow.

[00:34:08.650] - Liz
All right. Awesome. Thank you again. I really appreciate it.

[00:34:12.100] - Grayson
You are most welcome.

[00:00:13.250] - Liz, Host
Alright, guys. Our next speaker, I feel like doesn't actually need an introduction. This is his third time speaking at the summit. His sessions always get tons and tons of views. He is the go to WordPress guru in most blogging circles. I definitely pay him to be my go to every month, and I'm glad to do it. I'm excited to welcome back Grayson Bell from I Mark Interactive. Grayson, welcome back. Thanks for joining us again.

[00:00:39.580] - Grayson Bell
Thank you for having me. I'm excited to be back. These days, it's excited just to talk to people.

[00:00:45.640] - Liz, Host
Right.

[00:00:46.360] - Grayson Bell
So any way that I can, I'm in.

[00:00:49.390] - Liz, Host
Alright. So, we're going to be primarily talking to site speed and Google updates today because site speed always gets hurt on and people stress about it, sometimes more than they should and sometimes not enough. And then Google updates. One is rolling out right now. We can talk about those in general because they do happen regularly. So, what would you like to start with first?

[00:01:14.370] - Grayson Bell
Well, since we talk about site speed, let's talk about Google updates first.

[00:01:18.610] - Liz, Host
Okay.

[00:01:19.890] - Grayson Bell
So, yeah, there's one rolling out right now. This is a core update. Now, this year, 2021, Google, I think, was just like a, I mean it, they just went on some crazy bender of updates. You know I've been doing this since 2004. I've never seen this many updates, at least significant ones. Right? So, a lot of people think that when you have a core update and they drop some traffic, they automatically think there's something wrong with their website or there's a technical issue.

[00:01:54.020] - Grayson Bell
And I believe John Mueller, who's one of the search advocates for Google, came out and said, Actually, rarely is it a technical issue for a core update, because if you have a technical issue on your site, it'll typically manifest itself immediately inside of your Google search console or something like that. You'll see traffic drop immediately if there's a technical issue. Core updates in general are relevancy issues or content. So, basically, they find that your content, whatever that piece was, might not be as relevant as whomever went ahead of you.

[00:02:32.470] - Grayson Bell
Right. So, one of the things that we kind of like, try to tell people is one don't panic. If it's a core update, it usually takes several weeks for it to fluctuate out. Right. So, you might see a swing up or down and then it might normalize or even come back. So, don't just start going and making a bunch of changes. There's literally no point in doing that. It's like chasing your tail. I mean, you have no idea what you're actually going after. And in general, when there's a core update that happens. If you make changes to your content or to your site, most likely, you're not going to see an immediate turnaround.

[00:03:15.070] - Grayson Bell
That's just not really how core updates work. Even though Google does a lot of updates, you could be waiting until the next core update, depending on how much work you have to actually put in, right. So, we kind of just want people to.

[00:03:35.950] - Liz, Host
Sit tight.

[00:03:36.580] - Grayson Bell
Yeah, sit tight. Put the brakes on a little bit. These updates are happening a lot, and Google is getting very good at making sure they're pinning down what they call basically search intent. What they feel the searcher is actually trying to say when they're typing into the Google search box.

[00:03:57.070] - Grayson Bell
And a lot of times, especially, a lot of people got hit really hard in the July, the June and July ones this year. Also, during that time was the core web vitals update, which wasn't the same thing. A lot of people correlate them. They're not. They're two different ones. So, these were big ones. They got hit because what Google found out is that a lot of sites were ranking for keywords that in actuality, they really shouldn't have been ranking for like, oh, yeah. This really wasn't as relevant as we thought it was.

[00:04:33.070] - Grayson Bell
So, what they do is they basically don't deindex you. They just drop you down. It could be a couple of positions. And those couple of positions can really depending on where it is really hurt your search traffic. So, for example, I have a personal finance blog that I really don't write on anymore. I mean, I haven't read it on five years.

[00:04:54.440] - Liz, Host
We're both pretty bad about it.

[00:04:57.190] - Grayson Bell
Yeah.

[00:04:57.520] - Liz, Host
I'm resurrecting mine, but yeah.

[00:04:58.690] - Grayson Bell
I mean I'm actually playing around with trying to separate some new things. I'm going through a content audit because I started my personal finance blog in 2012. And I've had it for a long time, but I haven't written on it since 2016.

[00:05:13.470] - Grayson Bell
So, it's not fresh. There's a lot of bad content on there, because, I mean as you know, back in 2012 and 2013, you could do sponsored posts all day long and not the good sponsored posts. The stuff you shouldn't have been doing at the time. At that time, it wasn't a thing like you could just do it, right.

[00:05:31.650] - Liz, Host
Yeah.

[00:05:32.950] - Grayson Bell
Well, a lot of that stuff is still on there that needs to go. So I'm going through a content. But what happened in one of Google's updates and in the July update, we were ranking for a keyword term that really we should have been ranking for. It was like a locational term, like it was something near me. And I'm like, why are we even ranking for this? But we were getting a ton of traffic from it. But then Google realized why the heck are we ranking this guy?

[00:06:04.130] - Grayson Bell
So, I mean we went from like number eight to eleven. So, we got pushed off the first page and that dropped our traffic because that was actually one of our leading keyword terms. Because, again, haven't written on the five years. It was just kind of just running on autopilot. And it was slowly trickling down because you don't write on it for a long time, but just moving those couple of spots and you wouldn't think that you would have a lot of traffic on number eight. But eight compared to eleven when you're on now page two.

[00:06:35.590] - Grayson Bell
It's a big amount of traffic. So, there isn't really anything I could do about that, because we should have never been ranking for that term in the first place. So, it's kind of like, all right, well, let's go find some other low hanging fruit terms that we can probably incorporate into that post that might get us back some other you know.

[00:06:56.940] - Liz, Host
Traffic that's more relevant.

[00:06:58.130] - Grayson Bell
Yeah, more relevant that actually goes, oh, yeah, this works out. But you know, unfortunately, you know I didn't even start doing the content on until last month, and I don't expect any of the changes that I made, which aren't really significant to take effect in this new core update because I haven't done anything.

[00:07:17.920] - Liz, Host
Yeah.

[00:07:18.560] - Grayson Bell
But I would imagine when Google does their next update, which will probably be you know in another couple three or four months. It's usually around the time when they kind of push them through. But maybe if we make a number of significant changes, we make the content better, easy to read. Don't fill your site with a bunch of junk and stuff like that, then it might make a difference.

[00:07:39.940] - Liz, Host
Yes. So, I want to touch on a couple of things you said. So, we obviously said as a core update rolls out, put the breaks on. Don't go making a bunch of changes. That doesn't mean stop publishing content, though.

[00:07:50.710] - Grayson Bell
Correct.

[00:07:51.560] - Liz, Host
Just to be clear, it doesn't mean you just stop working on your blog. It just means don't make a bunch of changes and stuff already there.

[00:07:58.030] - Grayson Bell
Right.

[00:07:58.800] - Liz, Host
Okay. And then I did, because they are different. If you wouldn't mind delving in a little bit to these core updates versus the core web vital updates, since people do get confused.

[00:08:13.030] - Grayson Bell
Yeah. Yeah, I mean Google didn't do a great job with naming, naming conventions. So, core web vitals is their metrics that they revolve around more of the user experience and speed. It's all kind of like this combined thing. And core web also has Https security, mobile friendliness, no interstitial bad ads or anything that are popping up in people's faces and stuff like that. So, people hear core web browser and all they think is speed, but it's actually multiple facets hooked together. So, core web browser released itself into the world in June of this year 2021, and it was slow rolled. So, even though they released it in June, they slow rolled it out all the way until the end of August.

[00:09:04.250] - Grayson Bell
But really what we've seen so far, and we've talked to a lot of people. We've talked to a lot of SEO people as well. The really core Web models updates didn't really do much for traffic. It didn't significantly increase traffic. It didn't significantly decrease traffic. And I think Google indicated this would be the case. But what happened is there was just a bunch of hysteria in a lot of groups. A lot of things people were saying if you don't get this fixed, your site is basically going to be worthless enough.

[00:09:35.140] - Liz, Host
Yeah. There's a lot of fear mongering. There's always someone who's doing a fear mongering around that kind of thing.

[00:09:40.340] - Grayson Bell
Yeah. And a lot of it is people selling their services to try to fix it kind of stuff. But the thing is that there were people. I mean, I know some people that were charging you thousands of dollars to do core web vital fixes. The problem was that most sites wouldn't see a positive ROI in that. Right. We did a couple of tests with some customers of ours. Instead of fixing core web vitals or passing it, we focused on just making the user experience better, bigger fonts, making it easier to read, dealing with accessibility issues.

[00:10:16.810] - Grayson Bell
So, color combinations. A lot of people do really like colors. And if you have vision impairment and stuff like that, it's just really hard to read, right. So, we want to make those things easier. So, a lot of people made some really good changes of cleaning up their sites, and it was good. They might not have passed core web vitals, but what happened in doing so is that they actually not only cleaned up their sites, but they focused entirely on making their content better. And those people that did that, we did a small group of like 50 sites that just focused on that.

[00:10:52.600] - Grayson Bell
And then we did another group. Well, actually, like almost all of our customers, we worked on core web vitals in some sense. But then we started realizing that it really wasn't that big of a deal. The people that focused on the content were gangbusters in the updates. They were up 40 plus percent. I think we averaged, I think it was average 35%, but somewhere up 40. It was great. Now, when core web vitals came out, almost nothing. It might sound like a 1% for somebody, but we really saw nobody like fall down because of it.

[00:11:30.890] - Grayson Bell
So if you see your traffic declining, it's most likely not core web vitals. Don't get into a battle of trying to get into fixing core web vitals. Now, again, user experience is great for customers or readers or whoever. If you have ecommerce store, the faster your site is, it's going to be better, right? They'll get through even if you just have ads, the faster site loads. Technically, the more ads that can show, so you can make more. So, it's good as an all around part of the picture.

[00:12:01.450] - Grayson Bell
But if you're just focusing on core web vitals because you think your traffic is declining or it's going to decline, that's the wrong mindset to have.

[00:12:10.420] - Liz, Host
So, it's coming back really to content user experience.

[00:12:13.970] - Grayson Bell
It always is content. It's always content content. Content, content, content, I don't know how many times we have to say it, but I mean it's content. Again, focus on these other small things, but don't harp on things. I think it was all 2020 almost. And in the early 2021, everyone focused 100% on core web vitals. I saw a lot of messages on Facebook where people basically lost a bunch of traffic because they stopped even publishing content because they were focusing so hard on getting passing corporate vitals. They just stopped doing anything else on their site.

[00:12:50.610] - Grayson Bell
And that's really just. I mean, that's not the way to do it.

[00:12:55.230] - Liz, Host
No, it's amazing. That what just being consistent with creating content will do if you do nothing else.

[00:13:02.190] - Grayson Bell
Yeah. Good content. Right.

[00:13:03.740] - Liz, Host
Well, good content.

[00:13:05.870] - Grayson Bell
They'll just pump out like junk content. But good content that answers questions. Right. That answers a question or some type of intent. Yeah.

[00:13:17.490] - Liz, Host
Okay. I want to ask you some specifics of some things you said about user experience of just quick changes and fixes bigger fonts. What size fonts should people be using?

[00:13:26.280] - Grayson Bell
So, most people are between 18 and 21. Now this seems huge and 21 really can be. It really depends on the font style that you have.

[00:13:35.520] - Liz, Host
Okay.

[00:13:36.220] - Grayson Bell
So, I know a lot of people love to use Google fonts and stuff like that. We don't recommend it. The reason is that one Google fonts tend to be they do cause site speed issues. It has to load a font from Google and all that kind of stuff. We usually typically just recommend system fonts, and if you have a good theme, a lot of them allow you to just turn on a system font.

[00:14:00.280] - Grayson Bell
And all the system font is a font that is pre installed on your Reader's computer, and that's their default font. So if you don't specify a font, it's going to lay back to that. Most of them are like aerial Helvetica type layout. Now, the good thing about this is that readers are used to it.

[00:14:22.610] - Liz, Host
Yeah.

[00:14:24.870] - Grayson Bell
They don't have to sit there and squint to try to read your stuff. And here's one key thing not only for site speed, but also it's some of the things that I've talked to accessibility people they really harp on stop using script fonts. They are not only very hard to read. Typically, they're not big enough to actually somebody can read them, but also you have people with bad vision can't read it, and then you have script fonts are terrible for speed. I mean, just utterly terrible for speed because they're often very big font files that have to be downloaded.

[00:15:01.810] - Grayson Bell
So, I know people love their font styles and all this branding and all that kind of stuff. But you got to think one thing. And we've done several stuff talking with our readers and stuff like that. People don't care about your fonts they don't care about. They just want to read the content. They're not there to look at the design and style, especially on mobile. Although you can't really see a lot of that kind of stuff anyway, right.

[00:15:25.410] - Liz, Host
Unless it's blocking the content.

[00:15:27.870] - Grayson Bell
Right.

[00:15:29.130] - Liz, Host
I tried to go read a post today from my phone and I was like, you have 17 pop ups, and I don't see the exit button. I'm out of here.

[00:15:37.150] - Liz, Host
Yeah, that's a little bit different, but yeah.

[00:15:39.230] - Grayson Bell
But that is another thing, but yeah, like we try to tell people you have to be very careful with the items that you're adding onto your site, especially if you think. Ad networks are notorious for this kind of stuff. It doesn't matter what ad network is. If you think about it this way, they want to add more stuff. They want you to add more stuff to your site, so you can make more money, because that's how they make more money. But oftentimes it really destroys the user experience.

[00:16:08.330] - Liz, Host
Yeah.

[00:16:10.110] - Grayson Bell
I mean I know that we all have to get paid for our work, and there's nothing wrong with that. But there needs to be a happy medium between the two. Like, don't just keep turning on everything these companies tell you to turn on, because there is an underlying factor that they're like, oh, yeah, if they do this, they're going to make more money. But we make more money. It shouldn't always be about how much money you make. You should also think about.

[00:16:33.190] - Liz, Host
Long term sustainability.

[00:16:35.680] - Grayson Bell
Yes. Long term sustainability. Readers aren't going to come back to you and go, oh, yeah, this is a great site. It has really great information. Oh, wait. I can't read any of it.

[00:16:46.240] - Liz, Host
Yeah. And then the other thing I want to ask about specifically, I know this isn't like your area of expertise, but I'm sure it's something that you're dealing with a lot, and I'm seeing it come up more and more is accessibility issues. And using colors that are not contrasting enough make it difficult to read. So, yeah. What sort of quick things could you tell someone to do to make the site more accessible if you could.

[00:17:15.610] - Grayson Bell
Yeah. So, font size is a big one. Font size is a big one. You can even have a really good color. And typically most sites have a white background. You're going to want to have a dark font, either a pure black or even a really really dark gray. But if you go any lighter than that, you will have issues. Now, you can have a pink, but it's got to be a dark pink. It ends up being almost purple sometimes.

[00:17:42.790] - Liz, Host
Yeah.

[00:17:43.390] - Grayson Bell
A lot of people don't really realize it. There's a free tool. It's called Wave.webAIM.org, that you can put your home page. You have to put single posts or pages in, right.

[00:18:00.040] - Liz, Host
Yeah.

[00:18:00.260] - Grayson Bell
And it'll tell you if there's contrast issues. A lot of times you just don't realize because you are following your own branding, right. But your branding doesn't work with accessibility.

[00:18:10.660] - Liz, Host
Yeah. And you need to think of it not just a because it's the right thing to do. But be like, there are laws. I've seen a lot of people lately get sued over accessibility issues, so.

[00:18:24.990] - Grayson Bell
Yeah, so

[00:18:25.320] - Liz, Host
Different session on accessibility.

[00:18:26.250] - Grayson Bell
Yeah. I mean I'm no lawyer. We don't even actually like a lot of people ask us to do accessibility out. We won't do them because we can't be specifically responsible for saying, hey, you're now accessible because actually, I don't believe you can even be 100% accessible based on the current rules and regulations. Because it's almost like literally, I think somebody said it's like a unicorn to be 100%.

[00:18:54.720] - Liz, Host
Yeah. And those guidelines and stuff, like most things, the government aren't really up to date with the technology in a lot of ways, too. But that's also part of the thing is the tools that are being used to make sites accessible to people are different. You know the technology for that slow to adapt and change as well.

[00:19:16.850] - Grayson Bell
Yeah. I heard that they're coming up with a new one supposed to be soon. I don't even know what it's called, but new regulation or something like that or new guidelines, new guidelines. So, I mean, these tools, we're going to be chasing ourselves, really.

[00:19:31.930] - Liz, Host
Yeah.

[00:19:32.310] - Grayson Bell
But if you think about it, you know the accessibility thing is a weird one because these rules have been around for a very long time, and they haven't changed. But nobody really paid attention to them because I really don't think the government really understands knows how to handle websites or blogs in general.

[00:19:51.050] - Liz, Host
Yeah.

[00:19:51.660] - Grayson Bell
Right. It was only really built for physical places, restaurants, or even at the time, government websites.

[00:20:00.520] - Liz, Host
Yeah. Yeah.

[00:20:01.030] - Grayson Bell
It wasn't built for blogs and just bloggers, like, just regular content people. I get it a little bit more if you're selling if you're doing e commerce.

[00:20:11.220] - Liz, Host
Yeah.

[00:20:11.770] - Grayson Bell
Right. But I don't, I get that you should be as accessible as possible. I don't like the lawsuits. I mean, who does really? But I don't like that.

[00:20:23.010] - Liz, Host
Yeah. Okay. So we are running short on time. So, I do want to touch on a little bit of site speed. What are some things you want to make sure you know are working well, but aren't going to take a lot of time to improve on. Right. Like what's the low hanging fruit with site speed?

[00:20:44.950] - Grayson Bell
Low hanging fruit is opposite. The first one is always images. Images, images, images like image. People are, it doesn't matter notorious for uploading very large images. Never take something off your cell phone or your camera directly or even out of, like, Photoshop, and put it right into WordPress. That's a no-no. The aim that we go for and there's no rhyme or reason behind it. It's just literally you know basically off the total amount of page size. We try to tell people try not to get anything bigger than 150 KB per image in file size.

[00:21:26.770] - Grayson Bell
Now. Dimensionally, that can be a large world of sizes, right.

[00:21:33.050] - Liz, Host
Yeah.

[00:21:34.690] - Grayson Bell
We typically upload images that are 1200 pixels wide. Google's a fan of that for their Discover. And they'll use those as their sometimes the featured snippets 1200 pixels wide. You can do anything that's either like 1200 X 800 or even 1200 by 15 or 1700 if you like the Pinterest style layouts. But 1200 wide is what we go for. And that also gives you the ability to do we call future proofing is where you don't have to worry about having to change your images every time you change your theme.

[00:22:10.580] - Grayson Bell
So, images. You want to get those really optimized. There are several free tools that you can use. Squoosh is one. It's from Google. Short pixel is one. You don't even have to really pay for it. If you don't want to, you can actually load your images up on their own website and then download them before you upload. They have the plugin that you can pay for credits that will optimize your images.

[00:22:35.550] - Liz, Host
I think it includes, like 103 credits a month as well.

[00:22:38.210] - Grayson Bell
Credits, yes. But that's not images. It's just credits, so you can run through pretty easily

[00:22:42.910] - Liz, Host
Depending on how much you're publishing.

[00:22:44.540] - Grayson Bell
Yeah, but if you do images, is typically the biggest one, you want to not only resize down if you're uploading 3000 Pixel images, that's a no no. And also focus on the file size. Ads are always going to be an issue. It doesn't matter who you have. I mean, yes, like the Mediavines and the ad drives have optimized their code a lot better than most, but a lot of bloggers can't get on there.

[00:23:12.890] - Grayson Bell
So, if you have ads, you're probably going to see site speed tests show as poor. That doesn't mean that you can't pass core web vitals, and that doesn't mean that you can't be fast. That just looks terrible in a speed test, right?

[00:23:24.980] - Liz, Host
Yeah. Yeah, like, If you're in orange, don't freak out too much. If you're in red, do a little work.

[00:23:31.390] - Grayson Bell
Do some work. Do some work. orange is really not like, you going from orange to green really doesn't do anything.

[00:23:35.670] - Liz, Host
No.

[00:23:36.140] - Grayson Bell
And again, for site speed scores do not matter. Google's never used these scores. They've literally built this tool to show you how well you might be doing in optimal conditions. They literally just introduced a new update to it two days ago. I think it's actually a little bit harder to understand because they put the core web vials part up first. So, if you're failing, it just says fail. And so it looks like, oh, my god, I'm doing terrible. So, we're updating this in our site speed course because it doesn't look that great.

[00:24:08.810] - Grayson Bell
Like when you look at you're like, oh god.

[00:24:11.530] - Liz, Host
Are you talking about page speed insights?

[00:24:13.600] - Grayson Bell
Yes, yes.

[00:24:14.340] - Liz, Host
Yeah.

[00:24:14.540] - Grayson Bell
So, Google's Page Speed Insights, they changed it. They even changed the URL. So, it goes to like, their web Dev thing. So, yeah, images and then go through a plug in on it. Really a lot of times over the years. We just add plugins and maybe used it once and didn't realize that we were doing it. Getting rid of this stuff can get rid of stuff that might be loading on the front end. Page builder are typically a no no. I don't recommend page builder. You can use them if you want to do, like sales pages and stuff like that, but never put your post in them.

[00:24:44.260] - Grayson Bell
Don't build a whole website with them and stuff like that. And then really, we have found one of the best ROIs. Now this is more work, but the best ROI is a theme change. And that goes from depending on what theme you have, right? That's going from maybe a really big heavy theme to something that is clean and fast and well-coded. So, there's literally only two that we typically recommend, and that is generate press and cadence. Those are the two. They're both free. They do have a pro add on if you wanted more features, but by and far the two best that we use and recommend.

[00:25:26.120] - Grayson Bell
Ashford is pretty good too. I like Kadence more. And there I mean there are some other ones that might be okay, but those are the ones that we are typically moving most people over to. So, if you're going from a really heavy theme to a really fast theme that in itself typically will fix a lot of your problems.

[00:25:46.570] - Liz, Host
I just want to add if you're not sure if you have a heavy theme, I think one of the tips you gave last year it was really good is go to the theme demo site and run that through page speed insights, and see what it's coming up with. Right? Like, it's not going to be the exact same as your site, but it'll give you an idea.

[00:26:02.760] - Grayson Bell
Yeah. 100%. Like, we typically will run a demo through and you can kind of see the heft if you will. If they are built on Page Builder, I would just niche it immediately. I would just say this is not, there's a lot, majority of themes on, like theme forest, which is a really big theme. Marketplace, are almost always built on either Elementor, WP Page Builder I think it's called now, used to be called Visual Composer.

[00:26:33.380] - Liz, Host
Yeah.

[00:26:33.770] - Grayson Bell
Whatever it is. And those are really the two big ones that they build on.

[00:26:38.180] - Grayson Bell
Then you have Divi. I've never been a really big fan of Divi.

[00:26:44.260] - Liz, Host
Divi hard to leave.

[00:26:45.000] - Grayson Bell
Divi is hard to leave because they use like, a short code mess everywhere. They have made some really big changes this past year that have made it a little bit faster. But even though it's faster, we see a lot of bugs in it. A lot of pages end up just loading with blank content on it because their new method does this weird stuff to it. So, it's not 100%. And really, it's really just a pain to leave.

[00:27:08.990] - Grayson Bell
It really is. It's a huge pain to leave. I've never been a fan of Debbie. A lot of people use it, though, but usually when they leave it and they go like something with cadence and just pure, like Gutenberg. They are like, oh, wow, this is so much different. If you're really big into sales pages, maybe something like lead pages off. The site for your sales pages might be a better option, I believe. Well, actually, I know you can use, like, the lead pages plugin that you can make the sales page look like it's on your domain.

[00:27:40.170] - Grayson Bell
A lot of people do that.

[00:27:42.130] - Liz, Host
Okay. Yeah.

[00:27:42.490] - Grayson Bell
Lead pages obviously is a fee, but if you're doing lead pages correctly or sales pages correctly, you should be making enough money to count on that.

[00:27:51.440] - Liz, Host
You should be getting enough investment. Yeah.

[00:27:53.590] - Grayson Bell
Yeah, so.

[00:27:53.950] - Liz, Host
I will say. And I don't know if this has changed. I spent a long time since I use lead pages, but for their lead boxes and whatever. Those were short code. So,, just be careful with that.

[00:28:05.860] - Grayson Bell
Yes, they still do have those. I guess I was just referring to the landing page.

[00:28:13.150] - Liz, Host
To the landing page. I just, I just, you know, I feel like a lot of people can then, it's just as hard to leave.

[00:28:18.250] - Grayson Bell
I guess here's one of my biggest points since I know we're running short on time is really don't obsess so much about site speed. I have seen so many people over the past year get rid of everything in order to have a fast site, but then you have no opt ins. You have no sales conversions unless you're running just pure ads, but that should never be your main focus. Ad should always be a secondary or tertiary focus. You should never focus just purely on ad revenue.

[00:28:51.190] - Liz, Host
It's like bonus money.

[00:28:53.290] - Grayson Bell
Yeah, it should be mailbox money if you will. Right, like you should still have things that are going to make you money, affiliate conversions, all this kind of stuff. So, you have to understand that there needs to be a happy medium between the two. Don't just go wiping everything out because a fast site that makes you no money is worthless to you. And this is you know stuff I harp on with my customers all the time when they're just focusing 100% on sites. Be. I said, you guys need to remember that you take these things away.

[00:29:26.150] - Grayson Bell
You're going to lose revenue in some sort of fashion. You're not going to have opt ins anymore. So, you're going to have not be able to get people on your email list and sell them X, Y, and Z, so don't go crazy over. It's not that big of a factor. It does help in the grand scheme of things. It's a good part of the puzzle, but it's not the main piece. It should never be the main piece.

[00:29:48.410] - Liz, Host
Yes. Alright. I like it. Those were kind of final words, but any other final words? Is there anything anywhere you want to send attendees to check something out or?

[00:30:01.430] - Grayson Bell
We do have our site B course. We are updating it. We're actually going to be moving platforms in the beginning of the year. So, we have our site B course, which teaches you a lot of this stuff teaches you how to use specific plugins and stuff like that to optimize your site and all that kind of stuff. You can go to imrinteractive.com/site-speed-course. Those are dashes in between each word at the end of that one. It will teach you all the things you need to know, basically on how to handle site speed, and it really gives you a good view of what your site is actually doing.

[00:30:32.650] - Grayson Bell
I think that's the big thing that a lot of people that have taken it have noticed is, wow, I didn't know all these things affected my site this much. I was just putting them in because someone told me to put them in.

[00:30:43.850] - Liz, Host
Yeah. And then I think if you are super super new to blogging because we do end up with a lot of attendees, I think you still have your free WordPress course, right, wich will.

[00:30:52.760] - Grayson Bell
Still have the free WordPress course. I'm actually redoing that completely when we go to learn because it is old. It is old, and I don't really update it that much, but it is free. So, I mean.

[00:31:04.160] - Liz, Host
Yeah.

[00:31:05.490] - Grayson Bell
But I am revamping it to be like all on the new editor and all that kind of stuff. But WordPress is doing a big update in December, so I'm kind of waiting for a lot of the big portions to.

[00:31:16.830] - Liz, Host
We'll see kind of where it's at the summit starts January 31st, hopefully.

[00:31:20.230] - Grayson Bell
Yeah. I'm hoping that I have the course out by then.

[00:31:25.300] - Grayson Bell
It just depends on how much stuff I can get done between when they release it in December.

[00:31:32.610] - Liz, Host
We'll have the links below for both those things. Obviously, Grayson knows his stuff. He's always my go to person. Grayson, thanks again for joining us.

[00:31:43.510] - Grayson Bell
You are welcome. It was a pleasure.

**Transcript:**
[00:00:00.000] - Liz Stapleton, Host
All right, guys, thanks for joining me for this session with Julie Chickery. I'm so excited to be here. Thank you so much, Julie, for doing this. How are you?

[00:00:08.650] - Julie Chickery
I'm wonderful, and thanks for having me. I'm excited. 

[00:00:12.400] - Liz
Yeah, I'm super pumped for your session because you're diving into... I feel like the tech side is never really covered that much. You get told, ""Oh, use Yoast and use Akismet."" And you're maybe told why, but you're not told, ""Okay, what settings do I do? And what should I adjust? And why are they, how are those settings important?"", and so that's what you're getting into, right? I'm super excited to see that.

[00:00:36.800] - Julie
Yeah, I always had people asking me, I want to start a blog, but I don't really know how, and I would look around for resources for them. And there's so many great resources about doing things like monetizing or why you should have a blog, but not the actual hands-on, ""this is how you do it."" And there are some free resources that'll get you started. But this course is really aimed, that I have, is really aimed towards people who don't really feel comfortable with that self-taught type of thing.

[00:01:04.350] - Liz
Yeah. So that's your course and we're not getting quite into that. But you're going to dig into plug-ins because it's a good point you made. I remember when I first started blogging, I had less than a clue of what I was doing.

[00:01:15.350] - Julie
Yeah.

[00:01:15.620] - Liz
And my brother was super computer savvy. And I was like, ""How do you do a drop-down menu?"" Or, ""How do you do this?"", and he'd go and try to do something. And I'm like, ""There's no way every blogger out there is coding."" Like there's gotta, and I was like, ""Oh, there's these things called plug-ins. you know."" So you're going to be digging into plug-ins with your presentation. I'm super excited and people can... You know, we'll talk afterwards. But why don't you go ahead and get started?

[00:01:41.420] - Julie
Yeah. So I'm going to talk about a couple of different aspects around plug-ins. First off, I'll cover some of the top plug-ins that you need to have, like you mentioned, Yoast, so obviously I'll be talking a little bit about things like search engine optimization and even table of contents. But I will also get into a little bit of the how-to so that people see also how do I even find a plug-in? How do I vet a plug-in? Because there's a million plug-ins out there for any one task that you might want to do. So how do I know if that is a good plug-in or not? And then how do I get that darn thing on my site? Whether I have a WordPress site or Squarespace site, where do these plug-ins go anyway? So I'll cover a little bit of all of that.

[00:02:25.830] - Liz
Awesome. Well, let's go ahead and get to it.

[00:02:27.310] - Julie
So are you ready to learn more about plug-ins? In this session, I'll start by explaining what plug-ins are and how they can help your blog. When used properly, plug-ins will allow you to customize your blog any way you want. After explaining a bit about plug-ins and what they can do for you, I'll talk about the differences between the free and premium plug-ins and explain when it might make sense to pay for those premium versions. Then I'll help you navigate the more than 55,000 plug-ins in the WordPress directory by showing you how to find and then assess them. I'll also make some recommendations of plug-ins that I think every blog needs, but I'll focus more on the type of plug-in and the functionality that is essential.

[00:03:07.470] - Julie
First, let's talk about what types of things plug-ins do. Your theme determines the overall look and feel of your blog, but plug-ins extend that. They are tools that expand what you can do with your WordPress site without having to manually write code. There is virtually no limit to what you can do with WordPress plug-ins. If you want to do it, there's probably a plug-in for it. For example, common plug-ins to back up your WordPress   site. They help optimize your posts for search engines. They compress images and help save space. They add social media sharing buttons and create forms quickly and easily. In a minute, we'll take a look at the WordPress directory, and you'll see just how many plug-ins there are, and many of them will be free. So you might be wondering, why would you want to pay for a plug-in? Well, there are several reasons. While there are thousands of plug-ins available for free from the plug-in directory, paid plug-ins provide additional support and documentation. They also provide regular updates, and they have developers that work on maintaining the security and the compatibility of those plug-ins with the latest version of WordPress, as well as with themes and other plug-ins. Now that you have a basic idea of how plug-ins can help, let's take a look at how to find and assess them. The WordPress directory is the starting point for most people. It has over 55,000 plug-ins available, which is great, except that this abundance also makes it difficult to find that perfect plug-in. What I will do throughout this session is introduce you to a plug-in type, then take you to the WordPress directory to help you find and assess the right one for your blog.

[00:04:40.450] - Julie
We'll start with backup plug-ins. These are so important because they protect your content. There is nothing worse than losing all your hard work to a server crash, website malfunction, or a hacker. That's why using a plug-in that performs at least some basic backup is so important. Here are some functions to look for in a good backup plug-in. Automatic backups that allow you to schedule how often you want these WordPress backups of your website files and your WordPress database. The ability to store your backups in a cloud service like Dropbox or Google Drive. And one-click restore buttons that are especially helpful if something happens. The directory is found at wordpress.org, and you simply toggle to plug-ins. Then you enter a search term, and this is going to help you find a plug-in that meets that need. In this case, we'll search for backups. I like finding plug-ins that offer both free and premium levels. That allows you to start using them for free with a good degree of certainty that they'll work well, because these free plug-ins are used as lead generation for the company's paid options. They want them to work well so that eventually, you'll want to purchase the advanced features that come with their premium versions. Now, we've searched on backups, and we'll see a very long list. Going back to the top of the page, just a few things that you'll see is the name of the plug-in, the number and stars of the review, a very brief description of what it does, who's created it, how many active installations there are. This lets you know how many times the plug-in is actually being used by others, and what version of WordPress it was tested in. So here you can see we have two million-plus active installations. That's great. This has really been tested out by a lot of people. Down here you see one that's only 30,000+ active installations. It doesn't necessarily mean that it's not a good plug-in, it just means that it hasn't been tested by as many people.

[00:06:34.260] - Julie
Now another one I want to show you is Jetpack. And the reason why I want to point this out is because Jetpack will come up in a lot of different plug-in searches. That's because it doesn't only do backups. It also does other things I'm going to talk about, like search engine optimization, social sharing, protection, backup security, and more. Jetpack is automatically installed on many of the different hosting companies' WordPress sites. You either have to choose to deactivate it and delete it from your installation or use it. It is used by quite a few people. There's five million-plus active installations, and it has been tested with the latest one. It doesn't have quite as many reviews. Let me just talk about a few pros and cons of using an all-in-one versus using one that's specialized. The good thing about an all-in-one is that you don't have to worry about compatibility between different plug-ins, and it might not slow down your site as much because it's only one plug-in. Although that does depend on the developer. Sometimes, even though it's just one, it can slow down your site, and I'll talk later about how to test for that. The drawback is that it might be stretched in too many different directions, and it might not be as effective as some that are made specifically to combat one issue. I'm not going to say that one is better than the other. If you go and read about it online, you'll find plenty of people talking and making an argument for each case. I use UpdraftPlus, so let's take a look at that one and see why I chose it. Once you click into a plug-in, you'll see four different tabs: details, reviews, support, and development. This is great because it gives you more information in each category. If you're having problems, when you'd come to support, you'll want to read reviews to see how well it's performing. And then you come over here and it just gives you at a glance some of the things that we saw on the front page. I always look at how recently it was updated. You don't want something that was updated six months or a year ago. You want to see that it's being updated regularly, which WordPress versions it works on, and which one it was tested up to, it needs to be the most current. Now, the great thing about UpdraftPlus is that it not only allows you to do automatic backups to the cloud, which almost every backup plug-in is going to allow you to do. But one thing that goes a step further is it has that restoration that I was talking about, so you can restore something very quickly. Almost all of the plug-ins that I'm going to show you here today have a video that very briefly explains what it does. And before I choose a plug-in, I always watch the video to get a little more information about it. Sometimes they even show what it looks like in the site as well.

[00:09:02.100] - Julie
Once you're writing blog posts, you're going to want people to come read them. If you'd like to get more visitors to your site from search engines, you'll want to consider a Search Engine Optimization plug-in. Some functions that these SEO plug-ins perform are Site Map Help. This really helps you create an updated XML site map for your website. It also helps with a state-of-the-art schema implementation, which helps search engines make sense of your site and increase the chance of those coveted, rich results. The great thing about the plug-in doing this is you don't really have to understand all the technology behind it, or even the technical terms. It will also help you optimize your posts for keywords, key phrases, and synonyms. The goal is to have a post ranked for a certain keyword or phrase, so you have to optimize for it. The phrase is more likely to be part of a sentence, so when optimizing your content for that key phrase, an SEO plug-in is a great help because it runs a check on your content to find out if you're using your key phrase enough, but not too much. If you want to write an article that is nice and easy to read, you're going to want to use synonyms in addition throughout the text, because repeating your exact focus key phrase actually impairs readability. Using synonyms is a great way to help users understand your copy better, and search engines will recognize these synonyms as well. They'll understand that your text is still on topic.

[00:10:21.810] - Julie
A plug-in can also help you optimize your meta description, which is primarily used for search engines to show a description of your page right under that search engine result. Tailoring and writing a descriptive meta description encourages users to click your results in the search engine, even if you're not necessarily ranking at the very top position. Another great function of an SEO plug-in is the analysis that shows you a checklist of items and determines if you're using them best. For example, it'll check the article for that focus keyphrase. It'll look for external and internal links, headers and subheaders, as well as post-length. And then it will provide you with an overall score to let you know what areas you need to improve upon. You want to make sure that you're writing easy to digest, engaging content for both visitors and search engines.

[00:11:07.900] - Julie
Plug-ins specifically look for sentence and paragraph length, and active and passive voice to provide a readability analysis for you. So let's take a look in the WordPress directory, and we'll search on SEO. Now, just as before, you're going to see a very long list of plug-ins. They'll show you the number of active installations and the reviews, as well as providing a small description. I use Yoast SEO, which actually has more than five million active installations. As you can see, Yoast SEO has been working since 2008. It's currently the number one WordPress SEO plug-in. You can see that it was last updated only three days ago, so they really stay on top of it. And that's because, again, like I mentioned before, this one has not only a free, but also a premium side to it. If we come down to what it does, you'll see it does help with title and meta description, even providing templates for you. Schema implementation, helping search engines make sense of your site, the XML site maps, full control over your site's breadcrumbs. And then there are some additional premium options. It tells you how it's going to help you write content by giving you that SEO analysis that I talked about, as well as the readability analysis. And then again, several premium options like automatic internal linking suggestions, so you don't have to remember to do it, will also help keep your site in perfect shape because it's going to help with things like tuning the engine of your website, so you can focus on great content, giving you cornerstone content and internal leaking features. Again, in each one of these categories, there's premium content, and you can get premium support if you purchase that. One thing that I like about Yoast SEO is that they have the Yoast Academy. I would definitely recommend starting out with the free version of that plug-in and signing up for their free WordPress training, WordPress for beginners. It's going to help you not only with setting up the site, but getting your SEO going right. And then you can take additional training if you want. You can also sign up for their newsletter, which I do, that gives you good tips, and they have a blog about Search Engine Optimization. All in all, it's a great free way to get started. And then as you learn more about SEO and you want more robust features, then it does provide the Premium plug-in to let you take it to the next step.

[00:13:32.610] - Julie
And now that we're thinking of search engines, let's talk about the importance of Google Analytics. Most every blogger at least looks at how many visitors they receive overall. But let's talk about why you should dig even deeper by taking a deeper look at identifying which specific organic words drive traffic to your site, you can take aims to increase it. Google Analytics plug-ins give you a simple way to connect your WordPress site to your Google Analytics account. With it, you can see how site visitors find your website and what they do while they're there. With this data, you're able to capitalize on what site visitors like to keep them coming back for more. So let's look at some features that you'll want in your Google Analytics plug-ins. One is the Dashboard Reports. You want to be able to see real-time statistics in an easy to read report found right in the dashboard of your WordPress site, so you don't have to leave it. Your stats will never be skewed if you have a universal tracking system. In other words, if your site visitors switch from a mobile device to desktop, you'll still get accurate data counts. You also want to automatically track clicks on your affiliate links, your banner ads, and other outbound links, and you can do that with link tracking. And finally, you want to identify content that readers want. Google Analytics can help you eliminate the guesswork when it comes to finding out what content your visitors are interested in. Great plug-ins provide content reports that show exactly which content gets the most visits so that you can analyze and optimize it for higher conversions. Let's take a look at the WordPress directory, and we'll search on Analytics. Now again, you're going to see the same type of list that we did with the backends and the SEO. This first one right here is the one I use. It's by MonsterInsights with two million-plus active installations. You can see it's more than many of the others. Let's take a click and see more. They actually kind of show you what it looks like in your WordPress dashboard. You can see that it was just updated two weeks ago, so they stay on top of it. And you can come over here and read reviews. I always like to read not only the highest star reviews, but the lowest star reviews as well, because I want to see those people that did have a problem with it. What was it that they didn't like about it? That will help me make a better assessment on whether it's the right plug-in for me. This tells you that they make it effortless to properly connect your WordPress site with your Google Analytics, so you can start making data-driven decisions to grow your business. Again, those reports are right inside your WordPress dashboard, so you don't have to go and learn Google. That's why not only small businesses, but big companies use it as well. And again, there's a video, which I always recommend that people watch. Below that, they talk about the ease in setting it up, as well as the different reports that you can see, so I just want to show you a couple because it is really some great functionality. There's an audience report that helps you get to know your visitors. So, not only seeing where they came from, but demographic reports as well. You can see age and gender, also behavior reports. You want to know what keywords that they were searching for and where they came from, and when they were on your site, did they link to other content that you had? You want to see which content gets the most visit, and also how long people are staying on each individual page. If you have e-commerce, you're going to want to know that as well. And a little later, we'll talk about forms, and this can give you more information on which forms people are filling out. I definitely think that MonsterInsights is a great Google Analytics plug-in for WordPress.

[00:16:58.950] - Julie
Every great blog has plenty of photographs, but did you know that images tend to take up the majority of your website's page weight? Without image optimization for speed and performance, your loading times will suffer. Some features to look for in image optimization plug-ins is something called lossless compression. This is when they strip unused data without affecting image quality. It can also have image resizing, where you set a max width and height, and large images will scale down as they're being compressed. You also want to be able to quickly locate images that are slowing down your site with different reports, as well as the ability to optimize images, even if they're not located in the Media Library. So let's take a look in the WordPress directory for an image optimization plug-in. Now, as you can see with these, there's not quite the volume of installations, 700,000; 40,000; 200,000. We're not seeing the multi-millions here. One of the reasons is because some bloggers,  actually, I should say many bloggers, actually optimize their images for size before they upload them to their blog. So I do that now. One of the great thing about these types of plug-ins, though, is it can help you after the fact. So if you didn't pre-optimize, if you didn't know about it and you had your blog for a number of months, and you already have images up there, and you don't want to go back to all them, you can use an image optimizer like Smush that will let you go back and bulk optimize. This one does actually have more than a million active installations. It is updated regularly, and you can see which version it works for. And the great thing is it does have the lossless compression that I talked about. It also has something called Lazy Load, which defers to off-screen images if you want. They also have the Bulk Smush, so optimizing up to 50 images at a time. So if you want to go back and retroactively optimize your images that are already uploaded to your blog. And many other features. A good thing to point out here is that it'll process all your files, which is PNG, JPEG, and GIF files. That's good to know because different bloggers have different preferences. I personally use JPEG for my blog. I don't have a photography website. I have a blog. I'm providing written content, and I want to supplement it with photographs. But these photographs aren't meant for people to download and hang up on their walls, so they don't need to be super large. That's why I use JPEG to begin with so that they're smaller before I even upload them to my site. It also helps you to preserve image quality because of the way that they actually reduce the file size. And there's a video here that explains that, and I definitely recommend, if you're considering this plug-in, that you watch the video. It will also compress them in any of the directory, and it lets you know that it is compatible with your favorite themes, builders, and media library plug-ins, because they have been around for a while.

Now, we all want our blog visitors to share our blog as well as our individual posts on social media. So let's make it easy for them with social media sharing buttons. Some of the features that you'll want to look for are things like theme design buttons, which give you the ability to select social media logos that will have a really uniform look across your entire website. Floating buttons are also a great approach. Static buttons are typically at the top of a blog post and at the bottom of a blog post. But many of your readers might come from a social engine search or a Pinterest search looking for just a specific answer, and they might browse through your blog and get halfway through, find the answer they want, and leave. Well, you still want to encourage them to share that, and a floating button follows them as they scroll down through the page. Another thing that encourages people to share is counters. By seeing that other people have shared on social media platforms like Facebook, Pinterest, Twitter, Instagram, it encourages them to do the same thing as well. Let's go to the directory and take a look at some social media sharing plug-ins. We'll search on Social Sharing. As you can see, again, there are a little bit smaller numbers, 200,000; 100,000. Now here we are back to Jetpack for WordPress. Remember we talked about this earlier? It's five million-plus active installations. It does a number of things. So if you had chosen that all in one, you wouldn't be searching for a separate social media sharing buttons, but it might not give you as many options with what you can do in the design and the floating buttons. So let's look over here at Social Media Share Buttons and Social Sharing Icons, which has 200,000 active installations. As you scroll down, again, there's a video and it tells you that it lets you share for email, Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, YouTube, and 200-plus other social media platforms. Who even knew there were that many? Now it tells you again that it's a free plug-in, but there's also a premium version, which, like I said, allows you to know that usually the free is pretty darn good because they're trying to convince you with that to buy their premium. The free also carries you through that learning curve and lets you decide if you're satisfied with that or if you want to go further. So I never say jump to the premium. I always say try out the free first and see how you like it. And at the end of this presentation, I'm going to specify some best practices and tests that you can do as you're trying the free version before you make your final decision. Now it gives you a list of all the different things you can do, like different designs that I talked about. Having several actions for one social media share icon so your Facebook can lead visitors to your Facebook page and give them the opportunity to like it, as well as opportunity for them to share on their social media sites. Also allows you to have those floating or sticking social media icons. Now notice it'll also let you sign up for email. We're going to talk about that very next slide. It is going to be about contact forms. So just hold that thought. You might want to use something specifically designed for that. One last thing that I do want to point out here, though, is that GDPR compliance is very important if you're operating a blog where you have visitors in Europe. So if you want to learn more about social media aspect of GDPR compliance, they actually have a really good page that gives you that information.

[00:22:52.140] - Julie
A contact form is one of the most important elements you need on your website. And using a good free form builder can actually skyrocket your website's growth. So what are some features that you want to look for in a form plug-in? Well, one might be templates, prebuilt templates that allow you to make it very simple to just get started right away. Later, if you want to have a visual builder that allows you to drag and drop and get a little more creative in your forms. But it absolutely has to be mobile-friendly, so that your forms will look great on all devices, whether it's mobile, tablet, laptop, or even desktop. Finally, you do want to have that email integration. So at some point, you're going to want to start building an email list, and choosing a plug-in that can integrate with your email marketing service will make things simpler all around. Let's go back to the directory and look at some forms plug-ins. As you can see, forms are very common. Here we have five million-plus active installations, three million-plus active installations. Again, you can also look at the number of reviews. This is the one that I use, which is by WPForms. It also has a free and premium version. It's mobile responsive, highly optimized for web and server performance. You can see it was last updated a week ago. Again, there's a video. The great thing about once you click on the video and then pause it is that you will get this thing that says ""more videos"". And check this out, ""how to create multiple columns in your form layouts"", ""how to create a user registration form"", ""how to use 'and/or' conditionals in your form"". What this is letting you know is that they have an actual YouTube channel that provides free support for their forms. When you go over to the YouTube channel, you can just click right here on the title. What it'll do is bring up their YouTube page. Then you can click on videos and you can actually see all of the videos they have, which is basically free support and free training. Who doesn't love that?

[00:24:50.200] - Julie
No one likes spam. But did you know that excessive spam comments can also hurt your website's rating with Google, as well as cause security problems? You can take control of that with an anti-spam plug-in. Some of the features that you'll want to look for in anti-spam plug-ins are the ability to automatically check all entries in a contact form and filter out the ones that look like spam. You also want them to be able to do the same thing with all the blog comments. You want to be able to have automatic options, so that you can set up a discard feature to outright block the worst spam. That'll save you disk space and it'll speed up your site, and the ability if you'd like to approve comments, so you can determine when and what type of comments you want to approve. Like maybe the first time an individual has ever posted a comment to your website, you have to approve it first. Then you can set a rule that after that, they're automatically approved. Let's go to the directory and search for some of these anti-spam plug-ins. Here you can see we have 200,000; 100,000, and here is Akismet. Akismet anti-spam, five million-plus active installations, is probably one of the most popular, and it's the one I happen to use. It shows you right up here with a quick visual what happens if, that visitors submit comments on your blog, or on your contact forms. It runs through Akismet, and then it tells you if it's spam. It does it automatically if you set up the rules that way so that you don't have to constantly go in there every day and delete out the spam. It will tell you again when it was last updated and what WordPress versions it works for. This tells you that Akismet checks your comments and contact form submissions against their global database of spam to prevent your site from publishing malicious content. Because when people put comments on your blog and it gets approved, then those links are there for your followers to click on. That's another reason why you don't want spam up there. You can automatically check it and filter it out, but it can also give you a status history if you want to go back and look at it. If you have moderators, you can see the number of approved comments for each one. Then again, the URL shown in the comment body, to reveal hidden or misleading links. Also, you're going to need to get an API key to use it. It's very simple. There's a tutorial when you do it inside WordPress, and the keys are free for personal blogs.

[00:26:58.140] - Julie
Plug-ins are great resources because they allow your site to do things it otherwise wouldn't be able to do. But the more plug-ins you have, the greater the risk of problems occurring within your site. And plug-ins can conflict with other plug-ins, WordPress, or even your theme. I want to cover some best practices for you to help you have the most success with your plug-ins. Since plug-ins have the potential to create security gaps in your site, you want to be sure the ones you choose have been properly vetted by knowledgeable developers who stand behind their work and professional support. That's one of the reasons why it's really great to use a plug-in that has both a free and a premium version because you know that they are making money from it, eventually, at least. So they're working hard to make both versions really good for you. In addition, each active plug-in does slow down your site by some amount. Imagine if it just slowed down the site by five milliseconds. If you had 20 active plug-ins, that means that every page would be a 10th of a second longer to load than if there were no plug-ins active, and it would become exponentially greater than that the more plug-ins you had. What you need to do is conduct speed tests. Before you install a plug-in, run a speed test on a site called pingdom.com. It's very easy. It'll give you an accurate reading. Then you can just write it down or take a screenshot. Install one plug-in and then run a speed test and check it again. You'll do that each time. If a plug-in adds significant amount of time to your speed site, then you're going to want to try to find a better plug-in. Another way to avoid these problems is to just not use too many plug-ins. Try to find ones that perform more than one function, but make sure they perform those functions well. If you get a large, bulky, all-in-one solution, but you only use it for one thing, it's still draining your site. What you want to do is prioritize. Now, this is one of the reasons why people pay for a premium plug-in because it typically has more robust features. Finally, you want to keep your plug-ins updated. The developers provide those updates not only to add new functionality, but also to patch security holes and to fix bugs, and to keep it updated with WordPress and your themes as well.

[00:00:03.650] - Kristen Doyle
Hey there, and welcome to 4 Website Mistakes That are Costing you Readers and Revenue. The reality is that you have less than 10 seconds to convince a visitor to your website that they are in the right place, and you could be losing readers and revenue without even realizing it. My name is Kristen Doyle, and I'm a web designer and a business coach who helps business owners like you build websites that attract and engage readers ultimately boosting your blog's revenue potential. I'm also the host of the Savvy Seller podcast, and I am passionate about helping people build a business that works around your lifestyle. Let's start by imagining for just a second that your blog is a physical store, and each visitor represents a potential reader or subscriber. Imagine that conversation that you would have with someone who walked in your front door for the very first time. What are those questions you would ask them? What would you tell them about yourself and your business? What would that conversation look and feel like? If your website were a brick and mortar business like we see in this picture, your homepage would be that conversation. For a lot of bloggers, it might currently sound a little bit like this.

[00:01:44.180] - Kristen Doyle
Hey, Welcome to my blog. You can read my posts, shop, or learn about me. I write about a lot of different categories. Here are my blog posts, and here is some stuff you can buy from me. Go ahead and get on my email list so I can contact you. Let me tell you all about myself. Okay, bye. In reality, there are four basic questions that every website needs to answer with a few variations here and there, depending on your specific business. But for most businesses, the first thing people need to know when they get to your website is who do you serve? They're thinking to themselves, Do I belong here? You also need to answer the question of how you can help them or how you can solve a problem or a pain point that they have. Your visitors also need to know that you know what you're talking about. You have to answer the question of why they should trust you. And then last but not least, how can they keep learning from you or support your work, whether that is by subscribing, buying your products, exploring your posts, whatever that might look like.

[00:03:09.180] - Kristen Doyle
And unfortunately, a lot of websites don't answer these questions very clearly if they answer them at all. And of course, this is a totally fake site that I made up because I would never throw anyone's real website under the proverbial bus. But if you are looking at this site and feeling like If your site might be making some of these mistakes and it might not be answering those four questions, then you are in the right place. Because our goals today are to spot those hidden website mistakes that could be turning people a way and to show you how you can make your website work harder for you by focusing on what your visitors need most. You'll walk away with actionable tips that you can implement today to create a site that turns more of your visitors into loyal readers and increases your blog's revenue. When someone new lands on your site for the first time, the last thing you want is for them to end up scratching their head and not sure what you're all about. That is why, Mistake number 1 is wasted space above the fold. Above the fold refers to that space that people can see on your website before they ever start to scroll.

[00:04:33.870] - Kristen Doyle
It actually comes from an old newspaper term, referring to what you can see on top of a stack of newspapers above the fold when they were stacked in those paper boxes and people only had the top half of the page to decide if they wanted to purchase that paper or not. See, the statistics show us that you only have a few seconds to make that first impression before someone clicks away from your site. And most often, they make that split-second decision before they ever start to scroll. In our bad website example, there is a huge hero section here, and you can't see anything else until you start to scroll down the page. A vague welcome message like, Welcome to my blog, doesn't give readers any real sense of what they will find on this website or why they should keep reading. Within seconds, your audience should know exactly what your blog offers and how it's relevant to them. Then this Learn More button doesn't really entice visitors to actually click on anything because it isn't clear what they are going to be clicking over to. You have to give them a clear path to follow.

[00:05:52.620] - Kristen Doyle
Using this generic stock photo doesn't add any personality or purpose to your homepage. In fact, stock photos like these can make your blog feel impersonal or forgettable. You want to use an image that matches your content, something like a kitchen scene if you're a food blogger or a family photo if your site focuses on parenting. When you're thinking about your above-the-fold space, make sure you're looking at your site on your laptop, but also on your phone. Over 50% of users are viewing websites sites from their phones, and that number goes up every single time a new study is done. And a lot of times that above the fold space shows even less content on a mobile device than it does on a desktop or laptop. So make sure it's looking good both places. So here are some things that you can try instead. When someone lands on your site, let them know three things right away before they scroll. The first one is that they are in the right place. Having your name, your logo, even a photo of you right here front and center lets people know that they have landed on the site they think they have.

[00:07:16.450] - Kristen Doyle
And an added bonus of having your photo here is it also helps make your site feel a little more personal. You also need to identify who you serve and how you help them right up front and center. Specifically, what problem can you help people solve or can you solve for them? And then make sure you're giving them a clear call to action, a clear first step, a place for them to get started. As a blogger, getting on your email list might be the most important thing for them to do, so put a great opt-in there. Above all, when you are on this hero section, be thinking about your audience plus the problem plus the solution that you offer with a clear call to action. Have you ever been to the Cheese Factory? I remember the first time I ever ate there. They handed me this 20-page, spiral-bound book for a menu, and it was so overwhelming. It took me forever to decide what I wanted. And to be honest, I probably made a panicked decision and just spit out the first thing that came to mind when the server came over to get my order.

[00:08:39.420] - Kristen Doyle
I took a look when I was grabbing this picture, and their website says they have over 250 menu items. Well, there is a term for that overwhelmed that I felt, and it turns out it's something most people experience. It's called decision paralysis. Simply put, it means that when people are given too many choices, we are more likely to walk away than to actually make any choice at all. That is why, Mistake number 2 is options overwhelm. There are dozens of clickable things on our fake homepage. The reality is that most people are only going to click one of them. Because once they do, they're now on a whole different page of your website. They're not nearly as likely to come back to the homepage to click something else as they are to either continue reading that page, click a link on that page to something else on your site, or just walk away from your site completely. The mistake here is treating your website like a table of contents and trying to throw everything on there like the giant cheesecake factory menu. The biggest culprits here are having way too many menu links, too many blog post categories, and just generally trying to show everything on just one page.

[00:10:12.920] - Kristen Doyle
The questions to ask yourself are how can you simplify things? What is it that you most want or need visitors to see and to do from this page? And then simplify your page to the point that everything on the page is pointing to that next step, whatever it is. Here are some practical action steps for this. Start by cleaning up the main menu at the top. Decide which links are most important to keep at the top, and then put the rest of them in the footer navigation, especially those links you know people will look for if they need them, things like your contact page, your privacy policy and terms of use. Another thing I really, really recommend doing is unless growing your social media following is the main thing that is making you money, and if it is, that's great. But if that's not you, then I would highly recommend that you move those social media links out of your header and down into the footer of your site. Because when people click on social media links, you are just inviting them to to get distracted and to forget all about you and your blog because now they're watching reels or they are scrolling other content, mindlessly not thinking about coming back to your website anymore.

[00:11:45.920] - Kristen Doyle
When it comes to what options you give people on the homepage, think less is more. Instead of bombarding visitors with every possible link or all of your blog categories, give them a clear starting point. In this section, we have highlighted three specific posts that are relevant and helpful for the target audience. Things like easy recipes, decluttering tips, family travel planning. When it comes to your blog's categories, highlight the ones that are most important. See, when visitors land on your page, they're probably scanning to see if your blog covers topics they're interested in. So instead of trying to list dozens of topics or cover everything all in one place, pick four or five key topics that best represent the focus of your blog. And while you're at it, be sure that you give those topics names that make it clear how they relate to your audience. For example, here In this screenshot, we have changed the generic travel tips to traveling with kids, recipes to kid friendly recipes, because that's the focus of this fake blog that I made up. A common mistake people make is thinking making that showing more options will make your site appeal to more readers.

[00:13:05.570] - Kristen Doyle
But just like the Cheesecake Factory, too many choices can just be overwhelming. So when you highlight a few key categories, specific posts, you are creating a much more inviting site that encourages readers to explore instead of leaving them feeling overwhelmed or feeling that decision paralysis. Now, I am sure we all have at least one friend who always makes it all about them. When it comes to your website, you do not want to be that person. See, your website visitors don't care about you until they have a reason to. So mistake number three is making the whole page all about you. See, it is easy to fall into the trap of sharing lots of personal details because we think it makes us relatable. But remember, most of all the time, visitors are coming to your blog to find solutions or inspiration for themselves not to hear your life story. It can be tempting to treat your blog like a journal or a diary where you talk about your personal journey and every step that led you to where you are now. But readers usually don't care that much about the backstory unless it directly relates to their own life or provides them with some actionable steps.

[00:14:28.450] - Kristen Doyle
Now, this one might hurt a little bit, but it's true. When it comes to your homepage, your visitors are the most important person, not you. It should be all about your reader and what they are going to get from your content. Let's talk about how to flip the script and make it all about your readers instead of you. In the Hero section, since your headline is the first thing people see, it needs to make a really great great first impression. Skip the generic, Welcome to my blog, and use a headline that highlights the main focus of your content. In this case, we're using tips, recipes, and travel hacks for families on the go. This immediately lets visitors know that they are in the right place. A quick intro beneath your headline can really go a long way in making readers feel at home, too. So instead of talking about yourself, try a sentence or two that shares what they will get out of your content. And then give readers a clear next step that is enticing and relevant. Instead of the Bland Learn More button, go for an email opt-in with something special that they will really want.

[00:15:45.010] - Kristen Doyle
The big thing to remember here is that your Hero section is your chance to connect right away with visitors. So you really want this part of your site to say, Hey, I get you, and I've got exactly what you need. Rephrase your section headings from generic titles to more specific phrases that give readers an idea of how each thing will help them or what they will get out of it. Ask yourself, if a reader only read this heading, would they understand why it is worth their time? Writing clear benefits-focused headings can really be the difference between readers scrolling on or actually clicking to explore more of this content. Every piece of content on your homepage, and really your website in general, should answer the simple question of, Why should my readers care about about this. When you keep the focus on your readers needs, it's a great way to ensure your blog doesn't feel self-centered, and instead it feels like a special resource that you created just for them. The About section is where you have an opportunity to show your visitors that you get their challenges and that you're here to help. So instead of listing out a bunch of hobbies or random facts, focus on those shared experiences or struggles that you have with them.

[00:17:22.530] - Kristen Doyle
Give them a reason to stick around by explaining how your blog can make their life easier or more fun or less stressful, highlighting those ways that you can help them. And keep your text relatable and warm. For example, in our updated website here for Busy Moms, it says, I know how challenging it can be to juggle a busy life, which is why I created this space for practical advice that fits right into your routine. Make sure you are writing like you're speaking to a friend who could really use your help, being empathetic and relatable all all the way through your copy. All right, last but not least, if the web is a big game of hide and seek, then you want to be the first one getting found, never the last. So that is why, Mistake number 4 is for getting about search engine optimization. And that's just the process of getting your pages to rank well in search. Your section headings and your button text can help search engines understand your content. Instead of using generic labels like blog or shop, use more descriptive, keyword-rich phrases that tell both your search engines and your readers what's inside.

[00:18:42.550] - Kristen Doyle
They're more likely to get clicked on that way, but they're also better for SEO. Seo details like titles, meta descriptions, and alt tags might feel small and unimportant, but either leaving them blank or just set to whatever the default is really is a missed opportunity. If your page is about travel tips for families, you want to make sure that your SEO details use those keywords. Most bloggers are actually more likely to get new readers through searches for specific blog posts than they are through your homepage in general. So make sure you're optimizing every post and every page on your website for search. Let's talk about how to do that. You'll want to start by finding relevant comment keywords on a website like Uber Suggest. Type in a few phrases related to your content. For this website, we might search family recipes or travel hacks for moms, and see what people are actually searching for in the Uber Suggest results. Then use those keywords throughout the text on the page. But remember, it should never feel forced or like you're just shoving keywords in. Your content should always read smoothly for real people, not just for search engines.

[00:20:05.890] - Kristen Doyle
When it comes to your blog post, make sure that you are using your main keyword, that most important one for each post, in your page title, in the link, your image file names, the alt text, and in your meta description, as well as incorporating them into the page copy or the text on the page. If you aren't sure exactly what all of those are, just go poking around your website a little because you'll see places to set all of those no matter your website platform. But if you are on WordPress, then I highly recommend you add the Rank Math plugin to help prompt you. Rank Math gives you a little side panel like the one you see here that really helps you know which things you've already done well and which things you still need to work on. As you complete those tasks, those red Xs will turn into green checks and your score will go up. And this is an that you're doing everything right to rank in Google. All right, let's recap those four mistakes that you might be making on your website. Mistake number one is not being clear about who you serve and how you help them above the fold before they ever start to scroll.

[00:21:21.530] - Kristen Doyle
And don't forget that you have to give them that one action step for how they can get started in that hero section as well. Then, Mistake number 2 is throwing everything at your visitors instead of honing in on the things that are most important. What you want to do instead is keep things more streamlined and really guide your visitors to their next step instead of throwing everything at them and making them decide what they should be clicking on. Mistake number 3 is making it all about you instead of focusing on how you are here to help your readers. And then, Mistake 4 is forgetting about optimizing for search. Well, if you are feeling like you've got a lot of work to do on your website, then I would like to share something special that I've made for you. It's my free guide to optimizing your blog's homepage, and it will walk you right through a conversion-optimized framework for your homepage that will fix all of these mistakes and then some, so that your site is resonating better with your visitors and performing better than ever. You can grab this free guide at KristenDoyle.co/homepage. If you have questions about anything I've shared today, I would love to connect with you.

[00:22:50.040] - Kristen Doyle
I always like to hear what changes you're making, how you're improving your website, or like I said, to help answer any questions that you might have. The best place to reach me is on Instagram at KristenDoyle.co. You can find more tips like these on my website at KristenDoyle.co, and in my weekly podcast, The Savvy Seller, which is on all of the podcast platforms. I hope you found these tips helpful, and I cannot wait to see how you are improving your website. Keep in mind that even small changes can lead to big results. So don't get overwhelmed.

Hey it’s Liz Stapleton here, your host of the Blogger Breakthrough Summit, I'm super excited for you to see this session, especially if you are a brand new blogger and maybe all you have managed to do is go through hosting and installing WordPress. And now you look at the WordPress dashboard. I don't know what to do or if you haven't started your blog yet and you're nervous about it, this is a great session to help you get an understanding and just familiarize yourself the platform, because I remember when I first started with WordPress, it was.

[00:00:38.940] - Liz
I had a really hard time like the learning curve, so steep, so I'm so glad that Lisa was willing to do the session to orient you to the Wordpress Dashboard, so you know where stuffs at and how to do things and some really important settings and stuff that you should set up from the start. So without further ado, I'll go ahead and let Lisa take it away

[00:00:57.180] - Lisa van der Velde, sassyboss.co/
Hi, I’m Lisa from SassyBoss . Welcome to the Blogger Breakthrough Summit. What I'm going to talk about today is the WordPress Dashboard.

[00:01:06.030] - Lisa
. I know a lot of people are struggling with WordPress. I definitely was when I first started out, and that's why I thought it would be a good idea to just walk you through the dashboard, have a look at a few things and make you feel more comfortable and confident in using WordPress. OK, so the things I'm going to talk about is one setting that you really need to set up for your blog. I'm going to show you how to create a menu, the difference between pages and posts.

[00:01:33.990] - Lisa
' And we might even have time to look at themes or plugins. So let's get started and have a look. OK, so here in the WordPress Dashboard, this is the backend of your site. So when you first log into WordPress, this is where you end up on the left. Here's your menu. So here you can do things like media folder. You can upload your images, you can create new blog posts, new pages, and check out your comments, on your appearance where you can upload your themes, customize things in theme, add widgets, create menus, edit your theme, can use that plugins over here.

[00:02:19.040] - Lisa
You can set up the users, here are some tools that don't think anyone really uses that much here. Here's settings and then here below might end up a few plugins that you have installed so you can click on them and go to the settings. OK, so the first thing I want to show you is a setting that is really important to set up because it's I'll just show you it's a permalink setting over here. You go to permalink and if you scroll down a bit, you can see the settings over here that you can choose from.

[00:02:55.680] - Lisa
"" So your permalink is you url with what comes behind your domain name. So the first part of your permalink is your domain name. And then the second part is your page name or your blog post. So to get that you want to end up, you want to click this site post name so your post name will end up behind your domain name. If you don't do that, if you choose one of these other ones, you might end up with the date in the URL.

[00:03:26.910] - Lisa
And this is not so good. You don't want that because if you have all the blog post, your your post is going to look outdated when it's strong, like this might be from twenty seventeen or something, then it will look really old. Plus also if you have your blog post name in your URL, it is good for your SEO because you blog post title often has keywords in it which will help your search engine optimization. So this is one of the first things you got to do and it's important to do this before you launch a blog, because if you do this, if you change, if you want to change it after you launch a blog, you end up changing your URL, which will change the link to your posts, which will break links and you don't want broken links.

[00:04:20.040] - Lisa
 So it's very important to select post name like sometimes already selected, but sometimes one of these other ones is selected. So it's important to change, to post name at the bottom. Here you click save changes and then you have that one set up properly. OK, so another good thing to do before you launch your blog is install plugins when you go to the menu over here and click on plugins.

[00:04:52.830] - Lisa
So a plugin is basically some functionality you can add to your WordPress site, like things like functionality or security, things like that.

[00:05:07.320] - Lisa
OK, so sometimes when you go first to your plugins, you already have a few installed. WordPress sometimes comes with jetpack or Hello Dolly, things like that installed. Delete hello Dolly and Jetpack, because that is not really necessary and jetpack is really big and bloated and it will slow down your site. So I'd just recommend deleting that one. So I have a few other ones installed here. I got Smosh to reduce my image sizes. I got a backup plug in to back up my site, got a security plug in, wordfence is good.

[00:05:46.170] - Lisa
Or you can use Ithemes security is a really good one too and I have a plugin so I highly recommend using not too many plugins, but only using things that you really need. Definitely a backup one and a security one. So if you want to add a new plug in, you can just click here “add new” and if you know the name of the plugin, you can search for it. Nothing, no. All right, in the search bar here, you can type the name of the plugin that you're looking for.

[00:06:20.140] - Lisa
You can find a plugin and then you can click install now and then it will give you a button to activate now and that will activate the plugin. Then often you have to go to the settings of your plugin to set everything up, how you like it, and that's how you install the plug in. OK, another thing to look at is wordpress themes over here. I'll show you where you can install a theme. Appearance themes. OK, here is your themes folder, and it will include the latest.

[00:07:01.030] - Lisa
 Well, this is a 2019 theme that WordPress every year gives you any theme. And here is a theme that I'm going to activate enfold. It's a really good theme. You can get it at what's it called. I theme forest, to get that theme forest. And envatomarket, I think it's called. Yeah. So you can get the enfold theme. It's really highly rated theme, a very flexible. You can do a lot of different things with it.

[00:07:37.600] - Lisa
Like for instance, you can choose the menu at the top or the side or your header. This is pretty much anything is possible with this theme. So yeah, look it up. I highly recommend enfold. They also have really great support, so if you ever stuck with anything like even just questions for customizing your theme, yeah, they give you a lot of support to answer all your questions. And they have a huge database already with a lot of questions that are already answered.

[00:08:09.110] - Lisa
 So you always find what you're looking for. So that's really important to look for when you buy a premium theme. It's important that it comes from a legitimate source that it has like four or five star rating, high ratings ones, and that people are very positive about it and that it has great support because you want to be able to have a theme that gets updated regularly and that they keep looking after because that's important for your security of your blog.

[00:08:39.950] - Lisa
And just to help you out, OK? To show you the difference between WordPress without a theme or the free thing that comes with or a pro theme, I might show you the difference, actually, because that's always good to see. So if I go to the front end of the site. By clicking on the business name, that's not my business, but I'm just looking for someone else. It's not doing it... OK, so this is what the site looks like with the twenty nineteen WordPress theme, very basic, very plain.

[00:09:21.880] - Lisa
This is a blog post. It's not a static page. I can show you how to set that up as well to have a static page. And let's go activate enfold and see how different that is. Go back to the backend, go to appearance, themes. And enfold and click activate. OK, well, think I have to wait a minute and be more patient. OK, so it's right away it goes opens the enfold settings, so here are some settings I actually have this installed earlier, so I already uploaded the logo  and a favicon.

[00:10:24.270] - Lisa
Let's go to the front end and see the difference. OK, so the logo will show up your homepage, sample Page, these are sample pages, sidebar. And here is a footer and there is not one section footer. So this is this is a blog post, sample blog post. So as you can see, the page looks so much different already. I did set up these colors earlier already. So that's a little bit on... But as you can see, it looks a lot different.

[00:11:03.960] - Lisa
OK, so I'll go. What I want to do now is show you how to set up the page. Let's go back to the back then. OK, let's add a page, over here you click add new. It's a bit slow, OK, so this is what your WordPress dashboard would normally look like without a theme, you’d add your home page title or whatever contact page or whatever you want to make, you add the title here. But if you have a theme installed with enfold, you get the advanced layout editor and you can click on that and use the editor.

[00:11:52.970] - Lisa
It's I like it better because it's easier to use. OK, so here I'm going to name my. Some reason it's not working. OK, I'm just going to call this page home, it’s the homepage and I'm going to publish it. There's no need to add anything to the picture. It's just one example. OK, then I go back here. No. And over here, you can see my homepage. And if I go back to the front end.

[00:12:36.440] - Lisa
My homepage is in the menu. This was the original home page that did not show up in pages, but this is my new page. And as you can see, this page is empty, so now I want to get rid of this original page. I can do it in the settings. I'll show you how. You go to see it is in settings, settings, reading. And here is your home page display so you can choose to have your blog as your home page or a static page.

[00:13:24.540] - Lisa
I want to have a static page as my home page, because on the page you can have more information than just a blog. A blog post, only show your blog posts, on a static page, you can add maybe a little bit about you or you can add services that you offer or maybe a product that you offer or maybe an email sign up form. So I prefer to have a static page as the homepage and then you can select which page that would be.

[00:13:52.860] - Lisa
And there is my page that I just created and click home, go down to the bottom. Save changes. OK, now let's have a look at the front end. OK, so now you can see that the blog is no longer there, so this is my home page. The menu still shows a sample page and another home page so we can fix this up in menus.

[00:14:27.490] - Lisa
You can go here and go down to menus or you can go to appearance in the backend. And if you go to the backend, appearance menus from the front end, you can quickly do it like this. OK, so here's your menus. Main menu is your main menu on the site, but it hasn't been set up yet, so I'll go set that up. On the left, you can see the pages that are available to add to your menu.

[00:14:58.840] - Lisa
So here is just a sample page if I click view. There's the home page that I just created and there that sample page. You can also post to your menu portfolio items, custom links, categories, formats and portfolio categories. I won't need any of that. Now, normally a menu is just pages that you created. So you'll find them in here. And if you can't see them, then go view all. OK, so I'm going to add my home page to the menu.

[00:15:31.670] - Lisa
OK, so there it is and there is an about me, if I want to add a contact page first, I'd have to go to pages and to create a contact page and then it will show up here and I can add it to the menu and like this. And if you want to have a submenu, you simply pull it to the side. OK, so I'm just going to put that one like that, so these two pages should appear in my menu on the home page now.

[00:16:07.990] - Lisa
So you have to set it as your enfold main menu over here. So the menu. And when I go to the front page. There's my home page and my about my page. OK, so this is how you set up your menu and your pages basically create a new page, then add it to your menu. Oh, one more thing I'll show you is back in pages. How easy it is to lay out a page with enfold as well.

[00:16:49.220] - Lisa
So if you have this home page and want to edit it. So you have all these elements here, so normally you have start with a page it shows you you layout elements, which is like basically blocks that you put your content into so you can choose a full block, a half a block that takes up half a page or a third of the page or two thirds or a quarter down to a fifth of the page. So you can make columns with this, which is great, because just in the normal workplace, I'm sure you didn't used to be able to do it.

[00:17:35.460] - Lisa
I'm not sure if you can now because of how you use the moment for a while, but it's definitely really makes it really easy. Layouts on your pages. You might not use columns on your blog posts, but on the pages, it's definitely handy. So, like, for instance, you could just drag this into your page and have a column you can on this column and then you have three columns in the page. If you go to content elements, you can drop content elements into your columns.

[00:18:06.940] - Lisa
So like you want to heading for your heading there and then you want some checks on there that you grab some text and put your text under that. And like, say you want. Seperaters are good to use for white space you can add a bit of white space between text and letters or images and things like that. Buttons are always handy. let's see.. Portfolio, which you can add images so you can have a blog post? Yeah, just a little digital displays blog post, you know, in a little area testimonials.

[00:18:52.580] - Lisa
You can submenu somewhere, you can use here. MailChimp, sign up, I use my lot, so I actually installed a plugin on my blog to have my mailerlite sign up forms with that. Yeah. Oh, social sharing buttons, comments, sections. So these are all things you can just drag into your columns over here. So it makes it really easy to build your site. What, for instance, we can quickly look at the front end if I just drop something now let's just follow through here and let's drop for....

[00:19:38.130] - Lisa
But we have to remember here. But let's just accept that and have look. Might not show too much because most ....[inaudible] let's have a look. So the portfolio, the what was it? My images didn't show up because I didn't have images, but this is the remember. What was it? No area that you can. Have a team member who is a team member so you'd add a photo to that, and then you'd add a bit of text about one here or here.

[00:20:31.090] - Lisa
You have a headline and then your text. So you can see that it has divided it in three columns. And, yeah, it's just a really easy way to build your blog with columns and column sections as well. I could show you the column sections. In the layout elements is also cross sections, so I can call a section there and you it [inaudible 00:21:06] . So you can edit it there and you can choose from so that I change the background color.

[00:21:15.120] - Lisa
Let's just pick a color here. Well, that will be a bit whiter. And then.... [inaudible 00:21:28] Now it has a color section, and then you have these three things that. All right. There you go, you have a color section you can use to divide something, you can make the color section higher as well, so you can put something in that and then have a different color section below that or color sections or just be this background to divide the component, which is a great way to do that.

[00:22:05.280] - Lisa
I'll show you how I've done that in my other site, like in my authors.

[00:22:11.640] - Liz
What's there to enforce? Well, I have no comment scrion here. And [inaudible 00:22:22]  I have that, look, this is a color section. And then it's white. I have color sections on these pages. That is a color section, then I have a white section with just a column in the middle, and then I have a color section, you can see diagonal lines as well. So that's a big color section, and there the color section finishes and a whole white section, so that's how you can use the color section.

[00:23:04.720] - Lisa
So it's this is quite ugly, but you get the idea anyway. So it's it's a great way to be able build a site. It makes it really easy to design it as long as, you know, you have good branding set up for your blog and you have the colors ready to go down on this and your colors and and work quite quickly like that. So I highly recommend enfold or there's other good things available as well. But often a premium theme is just so much better, so much easier to work with.

[00:23:36.880] - Lisa
It makes your whole design process so much easier. So yeah, definitely something to think about. OK, well, this was my whole WordPress dashboard tutorial, I hope you enjoyed it if you want to do a full blown course, I have a seven day email course. You can sign up with the link. There is a link somewhere that is not that might be a link to my blog planner, which is which will have a link to my course from the blog planner and get started with that and then sign up to my email course if you want to get walked through how to set up your own blog and what to do. And yeah, I just want to wish you all the best with your blog. Lots of luck. And if you have any questions, you can email me at any time on hi@sassyboss.co. Once you join my blog planner or course you'll get my emails and you can reply to those emails any time as well if you have any questions. And yeah, I hope you can conquer WordPress.

[00:24:45.830] - Lisa
All the best.

**Transcript:**
[00:00:00.100] - Liz Stapleton, Host
All right, guys. I'm super excited you guys are joining us with Pete from Do You Even Blog. He is, as he just said, a Elementor Master. We're going to talk about all things Elementor and Page Builders are within Pete. Welcome.

[00:00:15.030] - Pete McPherson
Thank you for having me. First of all, I'm excited to talk about my favorite tool ever, and just in general, excited to be here. So thanks, Liz. Yeah.

[00:00:23.680] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Because when you start blogging, there's obviously a lot of tech overwhelm, even the... Just even just getting a theme set up. But after you've been at it for a while, you reach the point where you need something to make pretty pages, not necessarily for blog post, although sometimes depending, but landing pages and sales pages and all that. And so then you start digging into page builders, and it's a whole other level of overwhelm. Yeah, totally. And which ones are good. Now I love Thrive themes products, but they were slowing down my sight, so I've been moving away from them. It's hard to force myself to learn a new tool. So that's one solution out there. But some of the others, I don't know how familiar are with them, just touch on them. I think there's Divi, Beaver Builder, and then Elementor. I think those are the main ones. Any thoughts on those before we- Yes.

[00:01:24.710] - Pete McPherson
Absolutely. So before we talk about anything specific, I want to tell people what Elementor is and what it is not. Think of a knife. You have a nice kitchen knife, and it's a chef's knife. It's a really great knife. It's for a very specific thing. But I would not use it to be able to screw in something into a socket or screws or it's not a hammer, it is a knife. Elementor is more like one of those sweet Swiss Army knives where you open it up and all the little prongs come out. You can use it for your theme. You can use it for a landing page or a sales page. You can use it for just a new header across your site. You can use it for just one widget in a blog post or on the sidebar or here, or there or anywhere. It doesn't matter. It is like a Swiss Army knife. But the good news is you only have to learn how to use the software Elementor once. And it is a little tricky. It's not super beginner friendly.

[00:02:21.570] - Liz Stapleton, Host
But once you learn that- I'm not a beginner. I tried using it last week. I was like, I can't get it to look at my watch.

[00:02:26.640] - Pete McPherson
There is that learning curve, totally. But once you have that, oh, man, you realize it is so versatile and powerful. You can use it for a bunch of different stuff. So Beaver Builder, I haven't used it in over two years now. It worked really well when I used it, but it was still a little limited, and it's not an Elementor. I was like, whatever. I wasn't very impressed with it. Divi, I tell everybody in my membership community, every blogger that I can get my hands on, don't use Divi ever, period. If you do, you're doing yourself a major disservice. It slows down your site, and it has since the day they created it. The code behind the scenes is very heavy. It's terrible. The worst part is that Divi does not want you to leave Divi. If you were to change your theme, if you were to uninstall it, it is a huge pain. In fact, there are WordPress plugins out there specifically built for all the people who have been like, This is a nightmare. How do I leave Divi? Now that's good news. There are people making plugins for it. But that should also be a very clear sign of don't use Divi.

[00:03:29.820] - Pete McPherson
It is slow. It has the same learning curve Elementor as. It just takes over your entire WordPress site. And if you ever want to leave, it's a disaster. Those are my thoughts on all the other page builders. Those are the biggest ones. There are maybe a few more.

[00:03:42.860] - Liz Stapleton, Host
There's tons of other stuff in there. And I mean, I love Thrive. I really love Thrive. It breaks my heart that it slowed down my sight that I'm making the choice that speed is better over the things it can do. And so then I asked Grayson, who's another speaker at the summit. I was like, What do you recommend? Because he is a WordPress guru, right? And he helps people fix sites and stuff. He's like, Elementor or Beaver Builder in terms of weighing down your site. I was.

[00:04:08.860] - Pete McPherson
Like, okay, Elementor- I agree with them 100 %.

[00:04:10.920] - Liz Stapleton, Host
-looking at it. And the great thing about Elementor is it's free. I mean, there is a paid version, a pro version that comes with more stuff, but there's free. So if you want to dive into, I don't know if you use the free or paid version. Paid. Okay. But can you get by with just the free version?

[00:04:32.530] - Pete McPherson
I would argue no. Yes, you can still use it. But so many of the different elements, think about widgets, the different elements are pro only. And it's not like it's $50 a month or $30 a month, it's $50 a year, which is just ludacriously affordable. You go look at other plugins, like a membership site plugin or something like that. They're all like $250 a year, $350 a year. You get up there. $50 a year is a steal for what the plugin is. Again, it's just because of the elements. If you don't want to use the theme builder, which is also pro-only, you can't use a form, like a form, like an email often or a contact form or anything, a pop-ups, again, pro-only. You can use it, but it's limited. It is. But the pro version is $50 a year.

[00:05:22.250] - Liz Stapleton, Host
It's not a huge cost. It's not a huge cost. Okay.

[00:05:27.200] - Pete McPherson
Avoid eating out for a week or avoid eating out lunches for a week and it's paid for for an entire year.

[00:05:33.570] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Make one affiliate sale.

[00:05:35.010] - Pete McPherson
That's right. Totally.

[00:05:37.360] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Your ad revenue for a month or something. It can pay for itself. It pays for itself. Yeah. Okay. So let's go ahead and dive into it then, because this is an action-oriented summit. We're not just selling things to people or anything. We want them to learn and take action. And also because I clearly don't know how to use Elementor something, I'm totally taking advantage of the session. If you want to go ahead and share your screen so we can dig in, look at the basics and what you need to know to get started with it.

[00:06:08.160] - Pete McPherson
Okay. So as I teach Elementor I thought it might be cool. This just occurred to me five seconds ago. Is there any specific landing page, maybe a short opt in page or something that we could build here in order to illustrate things? But after we're done here, Liz, I can actually just export it as a template, and anybody watching this can just import it and just go.

[00:06:28.330] - Liz Stapleton, Host
You want to do that? Yeah, let's do that. That's what I want to do.

[00:06:32.740] - Pete McPherson
Okay. So first of all, I think it's like $150 a year, and it's unlimited sites or 1,000 sites or something like that, by the way.

[00:06:42.780] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Like an agency version.

[00:06:44.210] - Pete McPherson
Of Elementar? Yeah, versus what I have and all my students, I just give them a license for free, and I have 250 websites, like using my license. Anyways. So a few things right off the bat. Like I said, this is like the utility night. This is like the Jack of all trades. You can use this for a ton of stuff. I want to show people the super fancy stuff first, and then we're going to just.

[00:07:08.270] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Dive in. Maybe the problem was I was using the free version, not the paid. This could be it.

[00:07:12.280] - Pete McPherson
It could be. So I want to talk about templates first, and then I'll show you how to use the plugin. Just give me two minutes here for a few things. So they have something called theme builder. What this is, it's not a WordPress theme. I just want everybody to know that. Elementor is not a WordPress theme. It is a page builder. Or more specifically, I would argue an element builder. Headers, footers, sidebars, widgets, titles, blog post, images, video, anything. All the different elements of a WordPress site, you can customize all that through Elementor. They have something called theme builder, which will allow you to create something, an element, whatever that is, and apply it across your entire site. So let's say you had Studio Press theme. You have a Studio Press theme or you have some other WordPress thing that you don't really like. You don't want to replace that.

[00:08:01.990] - Liz Stapleton, Host
But.

[00:08:02.660] - Pete McPherson
That footer, I just wish I could do this with the footer. You can come into theme builder and create headers, footers, single, which is like a single blog post template, for example. I do use Elementor across my team just because I'm a super nerd. You don't have to do that. All of my archive pages, which is what this is, slash blog slash podcast, this is built with Elementor. And you have and categories. Those are also archive pages. They all look exactly like this. All of my blog post are done in Elementor, designed in Elementor. When I edit this post, I edit it just like anybody does. On the back end of the WordPress.

[00:08:45.270] - Liz Stapleton, Host
It looks like this. Like Google. Yeah, totally.

[00:08:48.430] - Pete McPherson
But I have Elementor styling that page through a... It's called Single. What they immediately did is a single blog post, single page, whatever that is. Header, same thing. This is in Elementor. It's across my entire site. Footer, same thing. This is just Elementor, it's across my entire site. So that's what theme builder is. You can pick and choose which elements you want to use, et cetera, et cetera. That's the advanced stuff. I want to come back now and talk about that.

[00:09:13.880] - Liz Stapleton, Host
No, it's laying the land. I feel like the better I understand the bigger picture, the more I can find the zero in and figure things out. So I appreciate that. Cool.

[00:09:21.690] - Pete McPherson
I'm also going to talk really fast because I want to cover a lot of ground, and I assume people can stop this video and go back. So that's why I'm going to be blazing through this. So the best way to illustrate this, for the most part... Oh, I'm sorry, one more thing on templates. You also can do just normal little templates, like stuff you want to reuse over and over again. For example, I created a table of contents element, like a widget. Yesterday I was actually making a YouTube video, so I created this. It's super boring. This is literally what the element looks like out of the box. I have one that's customized. Why don't I just show you that one? Sorry. Anyways, so you can come in here and create little elements. It looks really funky right now, but this looks good when you actually insert it in a blog post.

[00:10:07.590] - Liz Stapleton, Host
And.

[00:10:08.050] - Pete McPherson
Just save them for later. I designed it, I made it purple. I added little pizza icons or what, which is really goofy looking. But now whenever I want to add that to a blog post, I could just find the template and insert it. I'll show you how to do that in a second, but just so.

[00:10:23.500] - Liz Stapleton, Host
You know. It's very much like the way Thrive is built, too. It is. Okay, yeah.

[00:10:27.960] - Pete McPherson
Very similar.

[00:10:29.740] - Liz Stapleton, Host
I say to someone who just moved over to Gutenberg four months ago. I'm like, from Classic Editor Thrive to Gutenberg and Block. It's just a little learning curve.

[00:10:41.960] - Pete McPherson
That's a lot. It's a lot of learning curves. That's multiple learning curves.

[00:10:45.460] - Liz Stapleton, Host
That looks good on the side, the table of contents.

[00:10:48.430] - Pete McPherson
Yeah. So I literally built this as a little template first, and then I just inserted it. I just dragged and dropped, which I'll show you in a second.

[00:10:55.450] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Yeah.

[00:10:56.140] - Pete McPherson
All right. So let's go super basic here, Liz. There are a few different ways to do this. I'm going to add a new page. My cat is over here, clawing at the door. It's locked in the room with me. Poor cat. I'm going to say this test landing page. You'll see this edit with Elementor button up here. If you don't have Gutenberg, it'll be right here in the center or somewhere.

[00:11:19.350] - Liz Stapleton, Host
At Gutenberg, though, guys, just do it. Just rip the bandaid off and go. It's actually not that bad. You just go convert to blocks.

[00:11:27.290] - Pete McPherson
It's not that bad.

[00:11:28.750] - Liz Stapleton, Host
It's the page building stuff that I'm struggling with.

[00:11:32.100] - Pete McPherson
The page building stuff. So we're going to do two things then.

[00:11:36.310] - Liz Stapleton, Host
So much so that the Summit affiliate page and everything, I built that entire site Thrive because I was like, I don't know how to use it. I've got templates. I'm going to pay for this later where I have to build it again, but for right now. All right.

[00:11:50.760] - Pete McPherson
So two things, and then we'll actually use Elementor. Ignored this. I was doing this yesterday. This is a test blog post, obviously. And let's say if somebody already has one written that they published a year ago and they want to add an opt-in form or they want to add some social share icons to the bottom, you could still do that with Elementor. It may not be ideal, but you could still do that. That edit with Elementor button is always going to be there. Let's just open that up and see what it looks like. This is going to be a blank page starting from fresh over here, but we'll come back to that. All right, so here's our thing. This is the way it's currently being displayed in the theme. You can see that this appears down here. This is the basic blank spot. Add something here that you'll always see whenever you are in an Elementor builder. That's what this is. This is the Elementor builder. If you wanted to add something to the end of a blog post, I just want to show that to you. You can still hit the Edit with Elementor, and you can put it down here, etc, etc.

[00:12:51.960] - Liz Stapleton, Host
That's still possible. That's like a WordPress blog that's in there.

[00:12:55.020] - Pete McPherson
Okay. So lesson one, this throws so many people off. It's absolutely astounding, excuse me. Learning just how to get around and what the heck is going on. So I want to talk about this menu first. Obviously, the big publish button. You can also save draft.

[00:13:11.930] - Liz Stapleton, Host
You.

[00:13:12.480] - Pete McPherson
Can save this entire page as a template. These are mostly pretty self-explanatory.

[00:13:17.090] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Let me just ask a question. Once you save it as a template, are you then able to update that template? Yeah, of course.

[00:13:23.600] - Pete McPherson
Totally. You'll notice in the WordPress dashboard, right where we were, it said templates over here, you can just find one and click Edit with Elementor. Okay.

[00:13:33.950] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Got you.

[00:13:37.260] - Pete McPherson
Navigator is this little guy right here. There's nothing on our page yet, but this is actually pretty handy for moving stuff around like dragging and dropping. We'll show you maybe that in a second. Responsive mode, so you can see what it looks like on mobile or tablet and desktop. This also allows you to edit specifically for mobile, tablet, or desktop. I'll show you what that means in just a second. That's where you find that. This is a revision history. It's going to show you all the changes we haven't made any yet. Settings, this one's important. Everybody's going to be clicking this button because of this. Page layout. This is really important. Everybody gets tripped up by this. Default is exactly the way your theme shows a post or a page, whichever one you're doing. We just created a page right here. Default is how your theme shows it. That's important. Elementor canvas is like blank canvas. You can remember it like that. It's literally going to take away all of our theme elements. No header, no footer, nothing. This is what we're going to be using to build a little short landing page. Okay.

[00:14:39.740] - Pete McPherson
And Elementor full width is exactly what it sounds like. It's full width, but it still has your header and your footer. Okay. So many people don't change it from default, and they're like, How do I get things over here? Over here and over here. That's why. That's why. If you're using whatever your theme is prescribing as a post for a page. So that's important. Hide title, whatever, featured image. You can also just do this from the back end of WordPress. Change the featured image like normal, status, draft, that stuff.

[00:15:13.170] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Yeah, that's the typical editing the document type stuff.

[00:15:17.440] - Pete McPherson
Totally. So this settings button, very important just for the page layout. Okay, let's talk about these two really quick. This is the elements. You click that button, you'll always see the big list of stuff that you can drag and drop. There's a little login element. You can always delete that. Now you see what I did right there, right-click. This is important. If you hover... Actually, I'm skipping that. I'm sorry. I get excited when you stop. You can always find the elements here. You can always search. Excuse me. You can find global elements, which are elements that you can place anywhere on your site and update them once they're all tied together.

[00:15:58.980] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Yeah.

[00:16:00.690] - Pete McPherson
It's pretty self-explanatory, but it takes a little bit of trickery to get used to. Yeah.

[00:16:04.340] - Liz Stapleton, Host
In my head, I'm like, oh, that's the Thrive symbol. So I'm just translating everything so I can learn the new one.

[00:16:09.610] - Pete McPherson
For example, you'll see how I have a global opt-in form that I've designed once. I've set it up once with my... I've integrated it with Active Campaign for my email service provider, and now I can put this in my Twitter, on blog post, on the sidebar, and it'll just be one. And I don't have to update all of those. I can just update the one global widget, and it applies those updates across wherever I have it. Okay, so click this button, you can access all the elements. Clicking this button gets you a few global settings, default colors, default fonts. It's pretty self-explanatory. This automatically has all Google fonts in there, I believe. You can also upload custom fonts. I'm not going to get into that today. Default colors.

[00:16:58.070] - Liz Stapleton, Host
I wouldn't recommend it because that's just one more thing on your site.

[00:17:02.950] - Pete McPherson
I think a lot of.

[00:17:03.610] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Those are fonts. I feel like.

[00:17:04.630] - Pete McPherson
Google fonts are so many. Oh, Google fonts. Yeah, Google fonts.

[00:17:07.580] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Are- Yeah, I would totally would use Google fonts. I want to upload additional because I'm like, you don't need to add more things like that to your site.

[00:17:14.420] - Pete McPherson
Well, that's what I've been doing just because it's faster, but I'm actually getting away from that, believe it or not. Anyways, another video, another video, another time. Okay, the three types of building blocks. If Elementor is a page builder, using blocks or different sections, whatever you want to call it, there are three hierarchies. The top one would be a section. This right here, hang on, let's go to page layout canvas, is a section. And then you have columns and then you have the individual elements. And you can edit settings for each of those. Let me show you what I mean. It came with a default section. This is like a big section. You can click this to drag it. You can actually click this to add another section, by the way. Let's go with a two-column section. You can do it again. These are sections. These are the big overarching things which you can put stuff into these are sections. You can also click that plus sign to add another one as well. Click the X to close that. You can obviously click the X to delete it. Again, this is like a drag and drop.

[00:18:20.190] - Pete McPherson
You can move it around. But the most important thing is the right-click. All the settings are accessed via right-click now.

[00:18:27.920] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Oh.

[00:18:29.040] - Pete McPherson
Yeah, or not all of them, but that's how you access the settings. One more thing. You'll notice when I click on this... Well, actually, you can't tell right now. Let's put a little element in here so you can tell. This area right here where I access how to edit the actual content and the design and stuff like that, it changes. I click on this section, it says, Edit section. If I click on this column right here where I'm clicking, Edit column. If I click on this little text, edit element, whatever this is, edit text editor. Okay. As you click around on these, this is what columns look like, the black things right here. You can edit those columns. This is important, trying to figure out how do I change the background color of just this column right here? How do I add another column? I could right-click and edit the column settings. There's one called Add New Column. How do I edit the settings on this text editor? You click in there and here are the others right here. You're going to right-click on there, Edit Text Editor, duplicate, copy, save as a global, etc, etc.

[00:19:39.260] - Pete McPherson
So sections, the biggest, broad things, columns are what's next? Every section has a column. If I added a new one right here, it has one column, as you can see, section column, and then the individual elements, whatever you throw in there. Let's throw a button in this one. Okay. There we go. Let's go over the three remaining things, and then we're done. This is all the behind the scenes, how to edit stuff, and then we'll actually start making some changes here. Content, obviously, that's where you change the content. That should be pretty self-explanatory, but there you go. You can change the way buttons look, the size of the buttons, the alignment where it links to the text join our thingy, the type, the learning button, the little success button, different icons, icon spacing, button idea, a crazy amount of stuff you can do, but primarily it's having to do with the content, what the thing is. Style is the way it looks. Changing the content, changing the way the content looks. Again, pretty self-explanatory, but there you go. And the more people play around with Elementor... I'm going to add another thing. I click that right there.

[00:20:53.400] - Pete McPherson
Let's add in a... I don't even know what the heck this is, how it forms. Just drag it in here. There we are. The more people start playing around with these and editing different elements, they'll realize that most of the settings are actually the same. Once you get used to this, you'll be able to go for styling all sorts of things that much quicker. Most of the settings are the same. Some elements have different aspects, but most of it's the same. -yeah. -advanced are... Is that what it sounds like? Margin and padding. I don't know how deep you want me to go into CSS.

[00:21:26.390] - Liz Stapleton, Host
-margin is outside, padding is inside.

[00:21:28.630] - Pete McPherson
That's absolutely right. So if I go to this column right here, let's make things different colors. I'm going to go change the background. Background type, classic color, red. Let's make this other one green just so you can see what the heck is going on here. This is beautiful. I love the way this is turned out. Not really. Let's say you want a more padding. Margin and padding, by the way, some of this maybe you'll use eventually if you're super advanced, but margin and padding, people actually use a great deal, and so they need to know it.

[00:22:04.470] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Yeah. You want to create white space, I mean, it's orange space in this case, but you typically don't want the copy or the content to be super white on the page. So you think those can.

[00:22:14.730] - Pete McPherson
Really help adjust things. I'm going to change the background color of this column, not the section, but the column to white. There we go. Obviously, margin would be making the entire thing push in. If I can just highlight this and delete it, all these links, by the way, you can click that and do individual stuff like that. If you just hit delete, it'll actually reset it. I wish there was a button for that. They would put a reset button, but they don't. So they go. Padding is going to keep the white border where it is and just push the rest of this stuff in. There we go. Yeah, margin outside, padding inside. Good job, Liz. Perfect.

[00:22:59.360] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Five years blogging, man.

[00:23:01.190] - Pete McPherson
I know. So what else? Other than this, it might just be helpful. Again, the big things are knowing your page layout and what the heck you're doing there. This is a blank canvas. This is with a.

[00:23:16.280] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Header- I think you even have an Elementor course, if I remember correctly.

[00:23:20.380] - Pete McPherson
I do.

[00:23:21.110] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Yeah. I think I even have it. I need to just take it because it's part of a bundle. Anyway.

[00:23:25.360] - Pete McPherson
So, yeah, this obviously one of the most important things, sections, that's the big chunks you can always access it.

[00:23:34.140] - Liz Stapleton, Host
The hierarchy is important.

[00:23:36.150] - Pete McPherson
Yeah. You can right-click and access some stuff right here. Plus sign as new. X deletes, obviously. Columns are another thing. You can also add a new column right here. There is a dragging thing for columns if you want to make something wider.

[00:23:53.010] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Pretty handy. I think my problem is I was on the free version. I can even share my screen just so people can see the difference a little bit if they want to. I might add that in after or something.

[00:24:04.550] - Pete McPherson
Okay. And then the individual elements accessed by clicking in there or clicking the little box in the right corner. Columns, left hand box, elements, right-hand blue box. I don't know why, but there it is. Okay. So you tell me, Liz, how we're doing on time, and if there's anything specific, would you like me to just quickly build out a page that looks decent so people can see what I'm doing and how I'm.

[00:24:33.840] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Doing it? Yeah. Let's just quickly build a squeeze page. We already got half the elements we need on here.

[00:24:38.190] - Pete McPherson
Okay. Well, I'm going from scratch. This is hitting something on me. Okay. Sure.

[00:24:43.290] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Let's build out a squeeze page, which if anyone doesn't know, it's perfect for the canvas layout because the idea is they either do what you want on the page or they leave.

[00:24:54.020] - Pete McPherson
I'm literally just going to copy one. How about this one? Sure. That looks good. Sort of, right?

[00:25:03.530] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Yeah.

[00:25:04.370] - Pete McPherson
Can we just... Oh, wait. Okay. Cool. Okay, well, this is- Does it make tables like that? This is a pop-up. Let's just pretend this was a page for now. I'm going to add one huge section. I'm going to change the height to be fit to screen. That's going to make it like... You can see it changed to the height of my screen. And if I were on mobile, it would change it to the height of my screen. That's how you make a big Jumbo. They call it Jumbo drawn. I'm just going to do it this way. Let's go and change the background color. Let's put a site title. They have these, by the way, which aren't edited right here, but they just pull from your WordPress site, site logo and site title. When I put this in here, it should just say, Do You Even Blog okay, it did. I thought that really worked. Let's go with... That's the wrong thing I'm editing. Let's edit this section. Background type. Let's get a nice color for now. We can always add an image as well by dragging something right here. What if we just do like...

[00:26:15.560] - Pete McPherson
That works. I don't know how this is going to look, by the way, but I don't know. People could change this, though, in the template. When I export this, obviously, please don't use me looking like an idiot on.

[00:26:27.550] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Your thing. Yeah, it'll look funny. It'll look like you didn't do it. Yeah.

[00:26:32.940] - Pete McPherson
I always use no repeat just because I don't want the image to repeat. Sometimes it does some different size screens. You don't have to do that. Size, I wanted to cover the entire page like that. It was zoomed in by default. I'm going to go change it to be like this. Okay. All right. If I didn't want to do fit the screen, I could also do minimum height, which you can set exactly what it sounds like. A minimum height. A child was banging in my door. Let's go with the screen. I also want to do full width. At the moment, you can't really see it, but it's not actually stretching to the very edge of the page. We can see it on the video. No, it still looks like it is right now. But either way, you can do stretch section, and that actually pulls it out to the very edge of the page.

[00:27:25.010] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Okay.

[00:27:26.030] - Pete McPherson
And also, you'll notice that this - I.

[00:27:27.360] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Think the thing when it's known, I was trying to do my page, I guess.

[00:27:30.480] - Pete McPherson
Yeah, and it's helpful to learn each of these and how they can be manipulated. You also see how wide this column is right here. That's because the content width is boxed. If I choose full width, it's going to stretch this out to the edge of the page as well. Okay. I am just going to keep it boxed for now. You can also change... This is really narrow. Let me change it to pretty far out there. Okay, that looks pretty good. So let's add... Let's go back on. I like this section over here. This column over here is nice. I don't think I'm going to do it at the very top of the page. Logo, I'm just going to keep my name. Let's add in this stuff over here in this column. So it looks like a headline, a heading. We'll add that below it and then a paragraph. We're about to go back and make all this look a little bit better. Then there was a button, View Details, that is button right here. Drag it in. We'll say I'm having trouble dragging, which does happen, by the way, that's where the Navigator comes into play.

[00:28:43.790] - Pete McPherson
You can also just hit Command I or Control I, but you can also find it to the button right here. So this Navigator is not working.

[00:28:52.380] - Liz Stapleton, Host
But it'll just list all the elements you could drag them in the Navigator if you want. Yeah.

[00:28:56.300] - Pete McPherson
This has been the case as of this week, by the way. I've never noticed it's.

[00:29:00.420] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Happening until- It might be an update needed of.

[00:29:02.710] - Pete McPherson
Some sort. It could be. Apologies, folks.

[00:29:05.510] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Anyways- By the time they see this, hopefully, it'll be fixed.

[00:29:08.710] - Pete McPherson
Yeah. Let's make some of this look a little bit better. So site title, I clicked on this, by the way, I came in a file, text color, all right, typography. I'm going to bump the font size down a little bit just like that. Now, this is an important part. What about on mobile? This is a heading. I'm going to make this look like a really big heading. I'm going to change the color to white as well. Make it look like a big heading. I'm not talking about major, babe. I love big fonts. Do something like that. That looks good. This obviously is going to be white, too. Yeah, we could actually do a white background if we want a darker text. I'm not going to do that right now, but people could do that. Let's drag this up a little bit under here. There we go. All right, All this stuff is viewable. Let's change the color of the button, by the way. What was view details? Let's do that. View details. I'm going to leave the link blank. Let's do a pretty edit style. Coming over here to background color.

[00:30:20.040] - Liz Stapleton, Host
-farm is good, I think. -yeah.

[00:30:22.020] - Pete McPherson
Let's do a little bit. I don't know. Text color, I'm going to make that dark details. It'd be cool if you can pull that purple. Anyways, it doesn't matter. All right, we're on our way. What about mobile? This is important because I don't want people to miss this. A few different things you could do here. There was this responsive mobile button down here. Right now, this is probably not optimal, obviously. Tablet, same thing. It's cutting off half my thing or whatever. I want people to know this. When you edit things on mobile or tablet or whatever, you're just editing on mobile or tablet or whatever. You will see, if I'm going to change this headline size, you'll see this little icon right here. Okay. By the way, you can also click this and go back to tablet, desktop.

[00:31:18.880] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Okay.

[00:31:19.490] - Pete McPherson
As I'm editing this font size and I'm like, Okay, I want it like this big. You could just click over here to mobile and then, Oh, I want it that big on mobile. It's pretty handy, and it hasn't changed a thing on desktop.

[00:31:37.110] - Liz Stapleton, Host
That's.

[00:31:37.520] - Pete McPherson
Just worth noting. Again, you could just come down to mobile and then just edit everything as usual. Like that size, I want it to be a little bit smaller, 14. By the way, you can also change things like alignment. Anywhere you see this little icon and you can change the way it looks, you can change that setting just for that device size. Okay, got you. So I want this to be aligned center on mobile, just mobile. It's not going to change the alignment on desktop. It's still way over there. Center. And what about this too? Center. And what about this too? Again, you don't have to do this, but you could. Again, you see that little icon, you know it's able to do that. So you could just make everything centered on mobile if you wanted to. There, it's not going to change. Let me go back here. Boom, there we go. Okay. All right, so let's just complete our little exercise here. I'm actually going to go back to my section settings, change my content width a little bit less, bring that in right there. And I'm going to add another column here. I'm going to add another column.

[00:32:48.810] - Pete McPherson
Let's make it a little bit like that maybe. That looks pretty good right there. So I'm going to introduce you to one. Oh, here's another trick. Save it. Save stuff. Saving is good. It doesn't save automatically, which is frustrating.

[00:33:02.980] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Oh, that's a great. Yeah. Always work on saving.

[00:33:06.000] - Pete McPherson
That's.

[00:33:08.430] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Built into us as kids because we're used to...

[00:33:11.730] - Pete McPherson
Google Docs.

[00:33:13.310] - Liz Stapleton, Host
I just don't know how easy they have it with automatic save.

[00:33:18.470] - Pete McPherson
It's true. All right. So we talked about sections, columns, and elements being the only three hierarchies. I'm about to throw a wrench at you. There is an element called intersection. Okay. Basically, they made this because people were complaining like, I want another section within a section. I want columns within columns. On this column right here, I want more columns. I want columns within column. So they made this called intersection. I'm going to drag this over here just like an element, and it added another section. So now I can make more columns. Basically just to get you columns within columns, that stuff. It's pretty handy, actually. So I am going to just throw that in. I'm going to put everything in this intersection for now. What was the... Join us now. They got a little headline area right there. Let's just throw that up.

[00:34:14.250] - Pete McPherson
Cool. And let's make that centered. Join us today. Let's make the... There we go. Now we get a little bit advanced here at Liz. So they have theirs underneath their background. There are a million gillion different ways you could do this in Elementor that's part of the problem. People could do this different ways.

[00:34:36.570] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Yeah, people think differently. You do it different ways.

[00:34:39.200] - Pete McPherson
Yeah. So you could actually update the background under Advanced, background just for this element. I'm going to just try that for a second. Let's see what this is like. You could do that. And you could make it maybe a little bit more padding in there. You could do it that way, and then you could add something underneath. I'm actually going to undo this and try to background.

[00:35:04.170] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Let's just.

[00:35:05.260] - Pete McPherson
Click that. There we go. It's at an intersection. I'm just going to leave it in that intersection and change that settings. Let's go style, background. Actually, what is this color? Let's just grab this color. Let me go in here, copy and paste this code down here. I don't know if there's a dropper function. I don't think there is. Anyways, I don't know. There we go. And say I wanted to make this heading text color dark. I want to.

[00:35:37.680] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Challenge you to see just how fast you can do this.

[00:35:41.180] - Pete McPherson
Do what?

[00:35:42.170] - Liz Stapleton, Host
I want to see how fast you can do this. It's like, right.

[00:35:45.740] - Pete McPherson
Okay, so I got that. Why don't we... I'm trying to think here. Let's just duplicate this. What are we trying to do? A form. Okay, so let's remove this guy and drag in a little form. All right. This intersection, I'm going to change the background to off white like they had it. I think it was almost white. It's like right there, something like that. All right, we're getting there. This isn't bad. If you click away, by the way, you can actually preview what it looks like. Yeah. There we go. That's not bad. So what have I got? I got a bunch of different things right here. You can see there's more spacing up here. You can also see this cool little arrow thing. We could totally do that. I'm going to go back to this intersection. It's called a shape divider. There we go, shape divider. Bottom, let's do a arrow. I think I got it the wrong way. Arrow. Okay, there you go. I guess some of this is like playing around with. That's totally not it. Oh, man.

[00:36:59.580] - Liz Stapleton, Host
No, you're You just need to do the width, not the height.

[00:37:03.210] - Pete McPherson
It's true. But as you can see, it was actually changing the... Here, I'll show you.

[00:37:07.250] - Liz Stapleton, Host
No, it's okay. It's good. We've got a wrap up.

[00:37:12.060] - Pete McPherson
It's pushing the white thing.

[00:37:15.380] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Got you.

[00:37:16.820] - Pete McPherson
Yeah, I'm sure I could fix that.

[00:37:18.520] - Liz Stapleton, Host
This is where different brands do different things. I would do that and then add padding, but everyone does things a little differently.

[00:37:24.050] - Pete McPherson
Everybody does two things differently. That is a very important part. What I would probably do is come down to this section, the one below it, and add another shape divided to the top. Top. Arrow. Is it actually coming through? I can't see. It is. It's just looking very odd. So shape divider, color, maybe a little bit taller. Not that tall. A little wider. I guess it's hard to see. Okay, well-.

[00:38:01.840] - Liz Stapleton, Host
We get the idea. You can always tweak and play around with things, and you usually will. Remember, when you tweak and play around to tweak the mobile to check it there. Totally. That's always very important. But I think you pretty much... Because then you just do a shape and a wire at the bottom to do a zig-ag. Yeah.

[00:38:17.620] - Pete McPherson
Another thing I'm going to.

[00:38:18.460] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Do- you can move the page in 15 minutes or so.

[00:38:21.950] - Pete McPherson
Totally. Another thing I'm going to do is just add a little bit more padding to this intersection just to really open up space like this. Yeah. Same thing with this down here. You could also do it to the column, which is generally where I start instead of intersections. But since we have them, let's just try it this way. Padding, let's just bump it up. I would probably make those the same padding, by the way. I'm going to actually get rid of the labels on this form. I just clicked on the form, get rid of this label. Now we're looking good. Let's edit a few things here. Column rows gap, spread it out just a little bit. Yeah.

[00:39:00.510] - Liz Stapleton, Host
And so I think you said you're going to export this, and we will include it in the Summit for people to get. And definitely, I mean, Do You Even Blog is just an excellent resource. Any final piece of advice, words, I could get if you were offering a preview besides this. I think it's plenty, but anything else you would add?

[00:39:22.120] - Pete McPherson
I don't think so. Again, everybody goes through the learning curve of learning everything that I just did. But they're not paying me... Let me to say this. It's such a versatile and powerful tool. It just goes with every WordPress theme, every WordPress website. You can use it as much or as little as you want to. It's so versatile. Just don't use Divi. That's my party.

[00:39:44.740] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Don't use Divi. Please, don't use. I'm like, okay, maybe I could actually use Elementor now, and I might need to go upgrade. And I'll post it. I'll just add it in five minutes be like, this is what the free version looks like, guys. And this is probably why I was struggling just so I can compare the two. I feel like seeing a list of features is hard to really visualize what that difference is. So thank you again. I really appreciate it. This is amazing. It looks really good. And everyone follow all his links and stuff below. And thank you again. I appreciate it.

[00:40:18.850] - Pete McPherson
You're welcome, Liz. I hope everybody gets a lot out of this. Any questions are also welcome to email me, technical questions on Elementor, pete@doyouevenblog.Com. Happy to hear from you.

[00:40:28.390] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Awesome. Yeah, definitely talk to him, guys. It's great. All right, guys. So when I did the session recording with Pete, I mentioned that I would just quickly show you what the free version looks like, because I definitely struggle with it. I don't know if some of the tips Pete taught me will help. But this is just a page, just like a test page, we're going to call it. I'm going to hit edit with Elementor. Let's see how it goes now that I've learned a little bit. But that way you can see what elements are available and what aren't. So let's see. Okay. It's already going a lot better. Let's make it a color. All right. Then the section. I'm just going to try to quickly build the same layout that you did. And I think there's a button. I don't know what that looks like. Color. Pink. Something. All right, and then, going to add a column. This is already going so much better for me, guys. I don't know if you've tried to use an Elementor before, but kudos, Pete. You're awesome. So this is just the free version. Obviously, it doesn't have as many elements.

[00:42:59.760] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Elements. I don't think there's a form element here. Let me check. Well, I knew ConvertKit form, so it works. There's global, I have obviously done that, but let's do...

[00:43:44.900] - Liz Stapleton, Host
It's possible I'm missing it or I just didn't do an intersection. I don't know if I did something right. I don't see how to do the arrow, but maybe that's where I need it. Let's try to put this here. Let's delete that column. Because I may be in the section there or so. I need to get the motion there. Maybe that's a paid thing, I'm thinking of this. Okay. I mean, never done this, I don't know what I'm doing. So it's going to be fun. Okay, so it's not going to actually show up. So this is different from the, I want to be able to see just how pretty or not pretty it looks. Just in terms of the portion. And then I have a little bit of a flower. I'm just going to try to get the flower. I'm just going to try to get the flower. I'm just going to try to get the flower. Yeah. So it's hard to see. So that's the free version. It doesn't give you as many of the elements, so it can't make it quite as nice as Pete's version. But I did just want to show you what the free version looks like.

[00:45:45.910] - Liz Stapleton, Host
There is a lot here. But if you want to really do exactly what you want on your site, then you probably do want to go with the Pro version. I'm also not delayed or anything because I'm just learning about this myself. I'm just curious. Sure. I'm going to go to. Yeah. Yeah. So hopefully that helps.

[00:00:12.760] - Rebekah
Hello and welcome to Master Your Content Organization Using Airtable.

[00:00:18.580] - Rebekah
I'm Rebekah Lara, and I'm honored to be here with you today. Thank you to Liz for hosting this amazing summit, and I can't wait to help you master all of your content in one simple tool. I'm Rebekah Lara. I'm a certified life coach and creator of the Time to Thrive program. I'm also an online business manager and most importantly, the mom to three girls. As you see here, who all happen to have some extra needs. S,o I share that with you because.

[00:00:48.190] - Rebekah
I want you to know that my business was born out of a necessity to keep things simple for myself, because I had become a full-time caregiver and parent to my daughters. When we realized that as each was born, they had a host of medical challenges and diagnoses. It became even more important when my oldest daughter went into acute liver failure, which resulted in multiple organ failure. She was in a medically induced coma for four weeks, and in the hospital for a total of 74 days.

[00:01:28.060] - Rebekah
But even after she was released home to us, I became her full-time caregiver. And I also started my business shortly after that. And it evolved over time, but in the process, I had to learn how to completely streamline my business to make it run in the simplest, easiest way possible, so that I could be present, not only for my daughters and all of their needs. And as my oldest was recovering, it took her about three and a half years to get to the point where she did not need an intense level of care each day.

[00:02:11.590] - Rebekah
So, even though I am, I shouldn't say even though, now I am happy to say that she has recovered to a point where she lives life almost the same way as her peers and classmates do. But even so, all three of my girls still have chronic medical conditions.

[00:02:31.480] - Rebekah
So, I spent a lot of my time taking them to doctors' appointments and specialists and therapies and all the things that they need to support them in the best way possible. But I still have a strong desire to have my own business, to be a career-driven woman. And I love showing up for my community and teaching them how to do this for themselves as well.

[00:02:54.510] - Rebekah
Because I know that each and every one of you has your own set of challenges in life, maybe with your own medical conditions or loved ones, maybe a caregiver, or going through some other difficult life circumstance. It happens to each and every one of us. And I want you to be prepared in the best way possible to handle those challenges and still allow your business to keep running alongside life and all that it throws your way.

[00:03:26.890] - Rebekah
So, before we get started, I want to ask you a couple simple questions that will help bring awareness to where you currently are in your business in life and how this tool can help you too. So, tell me, are you tired of spending hours at your computer and still not getting anything done? Tell me in the chat, share with all of us, where are you currently? Are you fed up with this as well? And if you can relate to any of my story and maybe you have some other outside life circumstances that prevent you from spending hours and hours at your computer, I get you. And if you do have that limited time, you don't want to be spending it searching and looking for content and trying to figure out the best way to repurpose and recycle what you've already created, those assets you've already created in your business. Likewise, are you tired of trying to keep track of all this content across multiple platforms? You may be sharing this content out on social media platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, Twitter, you name it.

[00:04:43.600] - Rebekah
There are so many options, right? On top of that, you probably have an email list and potentially some other places you share content like, podcasts or YouTube, blog posts, the list goes on. Tell us in the chat if you are tired of trying to keep track of this and you end up feeling like you have information spread out all over the place and you spend all your time trying to find it instead of actually repurposing it and reusing it in the best way possible.

[00:05:18.110] - Rebekah
So, if you can relate to anything I've shared so far, I would love to introduce you to one of my favorite tools, Airtable. In my opinion, this is a great place to organize all of your digital content. Not only content in the term of like blog posts and social media posts and podcast episodes, but Airtable can really be used across your whole entire business to organize your expenses and keep track of subscriptions, logins, optins, products, blog posts like everything that you use in your business can be organized and housed within your table, so that you have a one stop place to find everything that you need for your business.

[00:06:11.340] - Rebekah
And you can save a ton of time searching for this information. So, we are going to talk about some of these quick benefits, which I've kind of already mentioned, but I want you to really understand why I love this tool so much and why I think it can help you and your business as well. Now I'm going to demonstrate for you right now how you can get started with it once you click on the link and create your own free account, by the way, in Airtable, in order to use this.

[00:06:41.790] - Rebekah
Most of my clients and myself for a very long time used just the free version of Airtable to do everything that I'm going to show you. You can upgrade for additional features, but to get started, I recommend just signing up for a free Airtable account. It's all you really need to begin using this super valuable tool. Okay, so here we are. Once you click on the link, you will be brought to a page that looks just like this. And you'll notice in the right-hand corner, it will say sign-up and you'll want to click there. If you don't already have an Airtable account, again, free version, perfectly fine.

[00:07:21.010] - Rebekah
And you will sign up, get your free account and open this link, so that you have this template here. It should prompt you to make a copy. It usually will say something like copy base or allow you to save a copy into your own workspace. So, I'm going to hop over to my example version of this same template. Content bank is what we call it. By the way, you can customize anything I show you here in Airtable, rename it, change the colors, delete and add to it. So that is the good news. You don't have to use it exactly as is. But I'm going to show you how I set it up for you, so that you can get started. These are suggestions for how I've used it and my clients use it. But again, I want to encourage you to take this and tweak it and make it work best for you. So, you'll notice up at the top, I'm going to give you a quick tour here. You'll have all of these tabs already set up for you. The content bank, optins, products, and so on. We're going to click through each of these quickly and show you a quick tour of how you can use this.

[00:08:29.830] - Rebekah
But the thing I love about Airtable is that it is kind of like an Excel or similar Google Sheets kind of software, but it's kind of like amped up and has more power to sort and group and track and find things easily, which is why I love it. It has even more capabilities beyond that. You can create calendar views and forms and collect data from other people. It's really super helpful. So, right here in the content bank is where you can store all of your content. So, I like to kind of think of this as my bank that I'm going to go to and find the content over and over again, so I can repurpose it for different places such as Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, podcast, blog posts, and so on.

[00:09:24.640] - Speaker 2
Once you create the content, you store it here, so you can access it over and over again and you can take it and tweak it to fit each platform in the best way for that platform. But you won't have to start from scratch. So, here in the content bank, you'll notice I have different categories set up. So, one category for my business might be Asana tips.

[00:09:45.550] - Rebekah
This is another digital tool that I love, Asana. And so, I may create multiple pieces of content about how to use Asana. So here is my example. I put the main topic here, the date it was published. I can even link directly to a URL here, to a Google sheet, to the actual published URL, like if it was a blog post, for example. Keep track of the categories here, which by the way, you can have more than one category. And you can set these up by customizing the field here.

[00:10:18.210] - Rebekah
So, you can edit the field, change the name, add more of the categories down here, even customize the colors, and so on. Once again, in my upgraded product that I offered in the VIP pass here, you can learn how to customize this even more. Moving forward here, you can keep track of where you are sharing this out, and so you can keep track of did I share this to Facebook or Instagram yet? And so, you don't have to try to mentally keep track of these things. So, if there are related posts, you can find them here and link to them, so you know that you have shared it in a related post.

[00:11:04.000] - Rebekah
You can keep track of URL when you shared it on Facebook or Instagram, even if you shared it as part of an optin or product, affiliate program, newsletter or social media. All of these by the way, are linked records. When you see this little symbol here, it means it's linking to these other tabs or they're called records, and it's like a hyperlink. So, when I click here, it will open up directly into this other tab and it will show you where you saved it or shared it out on social media, which is the beauty of Airtable.

[00:11:41.520] - Rebekah
So, all this information is linked together, easy to find. And the second tab here is where you can keep track of all of your optins. This is super helpful if you have multiple optins or lead magnets and you can connect them to that content. So, you'll notice here, when you click on something like this and you open it up, it is showing you this information in the other tab. It's like a window into the tab. And notice this white line here links back and shows you where it's pulling the information. So, this is not a copy of that information, it's just a viewport into it.

[00:12:21.510] - Rebekah
So, you can see it in multiple ways. But the information is the same, it's not duplicate, it is the actual information that you put in over here in the content bank. So, if you had an optin that was related to how to use Asana, you might link it here, save all of this other information like a landing page wire, if you have that connected to your optin notes you want to keep for yourself, and so on. The next tab is products. So, maybe you sell products or services that are related to this content and maybe you post a blog post, right?

[00:13:03.010] - Rebekah
A lot of us are bloggers here. So, you might have a blog post related to Asana tips, but you also have a product that you're selling that is related to the same thing. So, you can keep track of those products here, what platform you might sell it in. Again, you can customize these by the way, once you get into here, the date you created it, and so on, always sharing and linking to the other fields, which we're going to get to next. So, the next one is email marketing.

[00:13:31.600] - Rebekah
So in other words, these are the emails or newsletters that you send out to your list. And in some cases, you are promoting a free lead magnet or a product or service that you offer. So you can keep track of each of those emails if you desire, with the date, the subject line, the link to the content. So, this is helpful by the way, you don't have to rewrite things. If you already wrote a blog post about how to use Asana, you just click on that every time you add something to this bank over here, it's going to show up in this list linked to content banks. So, when I click the plus sign, all of them will show up here.

[00:14:12.070] - Rebekah
So, as you have 50-100 blog posts, for example, they're all going to show up here and you can either search for them by typing in some keywords here and those will pop up, or you can go through the list and click on them. Once you do that, it's here. And then notice like if you have a Google Doc or a URL to the actual published post, you can click on them here and copy that text that you already wrote to use for your email newsletter or email that you're sending out. So, you don't have to rewrite everything. You can take and repurpose things you've already written. You can save attachments and graphics here by uploading them directly.

[00:14:53.920] - Rebekah
This is really helpful because in Airtable, you can upload them and then download them again. So, it's kind of a nice storage system. If there is a graphic that you sent out in the email that you might want to reuse on social media for example. So, once you save it here, you can download it again. Then you can even keep track of analytics and other information about your emails if that is helpful to you.

[00:15:19.290] - Rebekah
If something is not helpful to you, by the way, you don't care how many people you sent it to. For example, you click on these arrows throughout Airtable and it gives you this menu. You can go in and delete or hide fields. You can duplicate or insert new fields to add on to this. Similar to the other tabs, this is for affiliate program. So, if you're promoting someone else's program, it relates to your content. You can keep track of all of that here again linking to that previously written content that you stored in your bank. And then the final tab here is social media. This is general here. And I wrote month one because you can duplicate this by clicking on the arrow like I said, and clicking duplicate table. So, duplicating table is going to, excuse me, it's going to duplicate this entire thing for you, so you can keep track month by month. So, this might be for January 2023, and then you might duplicate it and make one for February, March, and so on. And you can rename your tables at any time. So, you can come in here and rename this as January 2023 or whatever you desire, and it will save it here.

[00:16:37.080] - Rebekah
And then in here, you can plan out your social media. I go into this further and more trainings that I have on social media planning and getting organized in Airtable. But the quick way to think about it is that you can type your caption right here in this box. If you want to expand the record, you click on these arrows and it opens it up in a larger window. And you'll see, you can type your whole caption here in this box as much as you want to write.

[00:17:06.810] - Rebekah
And then within that, you can either look at this information here in this card view or across the grid view. It doesn't matter. It's the same information, but you can link to that content. So, if you wrote a blog post now you want to capture some of that text, copy it and use it here for your Facebook caption. You can do that easily. Keep track of the date that you plan to publish this on Facebook, the graphics you're going to use, you can keep track of the status. So, maybe it's something that's a draft and you're working on or it's ready, or you've already published or scheduled it out.

[00:17:43.750] - Rebekah
You can keep track of the different types of content and again, the different platforms. So, if I create something for Facebook and I want to do something very similar on Instagram, I can click on this box and right-click with my mouse to get the duplicate record and then notice it made a copy here of everything that's the same. But I want to put this on Instagram instead. So, if I change the platform to Instagram, it will automatically sort it down here. I can open this up, notice it made a copy, and I can you know  add hashtags or tweak this, so that it fits the Instagram platform better. But most of my caption will already be written. I don't have to start from scratch. And then from there, you can you know create a schedule to publish out, whether it be the same day or next week or in three days, whatever it might be. You can keep track of that here with these dates, and you can even view it in a calendar view. So, notice here it shows you how many posts are going out on the 15th of August in the past or in the future.

[00:18:51.640] - Rebekah
You can drag and drop things to reorder when things are going out. It's a very handy tool and really easy to customize. So that was a quick tour of Airtable. I hope you found it to be incredibly valuable tool. I know that it saved me and my clients a ton of time in streamlining our systems and allowing us to find, track, sort, and repurpose our content to make our business run in the easiest, simplest way possible.
