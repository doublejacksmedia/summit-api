Hi, everyone. I am so excited to be part of Liz's Blogger Breakthrough Summit this year. I've been an attendee for the past few, and I feel like it's one of the best-organized and best-run online summits out there, especially since we've had to pivot to everything being online. Hi. My name is Gina Lincicum.

[00:00:30.760] - Gina
I'm from Connect and Learn blogging community, and today we're talking about the secrets of PLR. Now, before we get started, I would love for you to take a second and go in the chat box and let me know if you've ever heard of the term PLR, because as I go around teaching about it, I find more and more people have no idea what it is. But don't worry, you'll know what it is before you're done with our session today. So, let me go ahead and get my slides going here and we'll get started. All right, so like I said, my name is Gina.

[00:01:03.850] - Gina
I'm from Connect and Learn blogging community. I'm actually part of a partnership. My partner, Michelle Borocious and I have been coaching, and we were holding retreats for a while in person before everything happened, and now we do everything online just like everybody else. So, we've both been blogging for a very long time. We consider ourselves blogging dinosaurs.

[00:01:26.590] - Gina
We started back in, I think, 2008, 2009. We've been through all of the changes. We both make fulltime incomes from our blogs. We both have multiple blogs, and then we do other things. We also run teams.

[00:01:41.110] - Gina
So, when we talk about what the secrets are, that's what we're trying to get you to see, is how you can level up and make more money, put out more content, which will help you make more money. This is one of our secrets of how we do it. We both used PLR in our own businesses over the years, and we are so excited to teach you how to use it because we think it's really going to help you work smarter, not harder. All right, so before we get started, you might want to take a deep breath, give yourself a stretch. You might want to grab some tea or beverage.

[00:02:16.050] - Gina
You can always hit pause if you're watching the replay. This is a short class. You might want to take a couple of notes, but we do have a worksheet for you when we're done. And as Liz always says, go ahead and turn off your phone or flip it over, close those other tabs. It's a short class.

[00:02:32.440] - Gina
I really want you to get the most out of it. All right, so let's get started. After this class, I've got three goals for you, basically, I want you to know what the three types of done-for-you content are. So, you're creating content right now in your business and for your blog.

[00:02:47.740] - Gina
And you might not know that there's done-for-you content out there that you can purchase and use just the way it is. That's news to a lot of people. We're going to talk about that. Then we're going to focus in on one of those three, which is PLR, and I want to make sure you understand what it is when you're doing this session. Last, we'll talk about how to adapt it and use it in your business.

[00:03:10.410] - Gina
All right? The whole point here is for you to create more content, so you can earn more money. So, let's get started.

[00:03:20.210] - Gina
All right. First, we're going to talk about done-for-you content. One of the things we find as we're teaching about this is a lot of bloggers don't realize that the big guys out there, the big bloggers making big bucks, are not working alone. First of all, they probably have a team, but they're also purchasing some content. It's not possible for a single person to run a giant empire and be publishing every single day and making all kinds of money. It takes a lot.

[00:03:49.240] - Gina
And so, what a lot of people do is purchase content. Now, I guess I'm like a medium person. I purchase content too. So, there's other reasons to purchase content. You can have it published faster, obviously, if it's already done.

[00:04:02.770] - Gina
Let's say I want to write one article a week and purchase four. Well, then I could publish five articles a week, and that would be great for my site. The other reason that I do it personally is I've been blogging for almost 15 years. I am really tired of some of the things I do. I used to do recipes.

[00:04:20.100] - Gina
I had little kids. I would have to keep everybody's little paws off the food, make sure the lighting was perfect. Nobody could eat dinner till I was done taking pictures and making sure everything looked good. Then Pinterest came out and everybody's photography went up a couple of notches. Not mine.

[00:04:36.880] - Gina
I decided to outsource my recipes. So, now I purchase all those photos already done for me and the recipe, and all I have to do is write the blog post around it. So, for me, it doesn't just save time of having to go to the store, get the ingredients, make the food, photograph the food, edit the photographs, and all of that. It just shows up in my email and I take it and use it. And the blog post goes up relatively quickly.

[00:05:04.810] - Gina
So that's one of the reasons I do it. Another good reason to buy content would be if your audience and you have a mismatch. What I mean is, I know a lot of people who started blogs when their kids were little, maybe your blog is about preschool activities, you know, arts and crafts activities. Well, now it's 15 years later and your kids are in college and you don't have any little hands around the house to take pictures of doing projects.

[00:05:27.720] - Gina
Why don't you hire someone or buy some of this done-for-you content from someone that does have little kids who is doing these projects for somebody who's currently doing preschool and they know what is current with all the trends in preschool learning. You can own a blog that has an audience that is very different than who you are. That's totally fine. You might want to consider some done for you content. All right?

[00:05:52.200] - Gina
So, there's three types of done-for-you content. Let me show you some examples. So, first of all, I keep mentioning the recipes. There's something called exclusive content. Exclusive content is when you buy something and you're the only one who has it.

[00:06:10.170] - Gina
So, someone writes an article for you because you ask them to write an article, you know Ten Ways Busy Moms Can Do Selfcare. They write the article for you. It's bespoke, and you're the only person who has it that's exclusive. Now, that tends to be expensive, especially if it's things with photographs like crafts and recipes, like this one, right? If I was the only person to get this soup recipe, this would cost a certain amount of money.

[00:06:38.040] - Gina
And I will share some places where you can see what the prices are like, they're all over the place because that's how the market works. But just remember, you're the only person who has it. So, you can use it the way it is, but it will cost you. I like to purchase the type of content that's called semi-exclusive content. Now, semi-exclusive content tends to go out to three, four, five, or six people total.

[00:07:02.400] - Gina
So, for example, I purchased this particular soup, this 15 bean soup, from someone who was selling five copies of this recipe. So, there are five bloggers who have this particular recipe that we bought from the same person. All right. The good news is it's semi-exclusive, which means there's not a hundred of them out there. There's just these five. We have different photos for the finished products.

[00:07:27.220] - Gina
And here I have made a pin out of this one. I have got the one that has the white bowls. I've got the white towel with the painted background and the cutting board. So, the person who does my recipes, when she sells to five people, she does five different photo shoots for the finished food. So, everybody's will look different.

[00:07:49.440] - Gina
So, if you go and you find the other person, I don't even know who it is, the other four people who bought this recipe, it's not going to look the same as mine because the photos will be different. Now, the one thing that is usually the same is the ingredients shot. So, all five of us have this ingredients shot. You can use it or not use it, that's up to you. She also tends to share the process photos because you're obviously only making the recipe the one time.

[00:08:15.150] - Gina
So, there's not really a good way to do five separate ways. So, I tend to use my process photos in my slideshow videos and in idea pins. I don't tend to put those in my article. So, again, down here is another example of a finished photo that nobody else has. I have this one with a striped towel looking at it from the top.

[00:08:36.160] - Gina
The other thing you can do is take these photos just like you would with stock photos and do some editing. You can crop them however you'd like, you can turn them into pins, you can do collage. There's all kinds of things you can do with Canva, Pick monkey, whatever your editing system is for your photos. Alright? And the other thing I bought along with these beautiful finished photos is the actual recipe.

[00:08:58.770] - Gina
So, here's the recipe, it's in my recipe card. And then I think I have another pin. Here we go. I've got another pin down here where I put in one of the process images and then a finished image. All right, so that's a good example of semi-exclusive content.

[00:09:14.520] - Gina
The other kinds of semi-exclusive content that I've seen a lot of recently are graphics like hand puppets for little kids or craft like a wreath for a holiday, right? It's really nice if you are not a crafty person that you can publish that type of content just by purchasing it from somebody who is really good at it. And you don't have to be good at all the things, you don't have to be good at photography and be good at making the craft and be good at editing the photos and the writing. All right? You can just pick the part that you like to do, you can pick the part that you're good at and you can outsource the rest.

[00:09:51.520] - Gina
Alright? When you are looking at making more money with your business, you want to be working less time. And that's one of the ways you'll do it is with that kind of outsourcing. All right, let's go back to our slides. So, I shared all three kinds.

[00:10:04.690] - Gina
Exclusive, remember, is the most expensive because you're the only person who has it. The other kind of exclusive content that you may see are things like listicles. I've seen virtual assistants selling things like 20 great Valentine's Day gifts for moms. You're the only person who gets that. So, you can go ahead and use that just the way it is.

[00:10:26.850] - Gina
If you get semi-exclusive content, you will want to change it up a little bit like I showed you with the recipe. And then last but not least, we have PLR, the thing we're here for today. It stands for private label rights and we're going to dive into that in just a second. Before we do that, could you please go in the chat box and let me know how would using done-for-you content help you? I would love to know.

[00:10:57.010] - Gina
Thank you so much. All right, let's dig into PLR. So, what is it? Let's start with the word rights. Private label rights just means that the seller gets to determine how the buyer uses their products, right?

[00:11:12.450] - Gina
So, if I sell you a recipe and a bunch of photos, I get to tell you what you can do with it. Now, in my case, when I sell PLR, I say you can do anything you want with it except sell it again as PLR. So, you couldn't buy something from my PLR store and then go sell it to 500 people. It's the only thing you can't do. But you can take it, put your own name on it.

[00:11:35.900] - Gina
You can put it into an ebook. You can use it as a blog post. You can use it in your email newsletters. You could use it for a challenge that you do with your followers. You could chop it up and turn it into social media posts.

[00:11:48.260] - Gina
There's a lot of things that you can do with this PLR content that's already done for you. I typically see articles that are PLR, but we are starting to see more and more recipes, crafts, things like that that really do take people a lot of time. PLR doesn't cost as much as semi-exclusive and exclusive content. That's what's so great about it. We're talking like under $10.

[00:12:13.500] - Gina
We sell PLR articles for 3 to $4. Think about the amount of time that saves you. You get a 750 word article ready to go for 3 or $4. It's also a great way if you're not an expert on something. So, you're not an expert on camping, but you need some camping articles for your blog because your readers are asking for them.

[00:12:34.710] - Gina
You can purchase those. All right, so where to find it? I'm going to share lots and lots of ways at the end of where to find PLR. But just so you know, if you Google PLR, you're going to find tons and tons of old stuff. PLR has been around for a very long time.

[00:12:49.950] - Gina
So, just remember, the big difference for PLR is the price, which is really low, and the exclusivity, which is you know as many as they can sell, typically. That's the downside in a way. And we're going to talk in the next section about what to do about that, so it's not a downside.

[00:13:09.460] - Gina
Here's my favorite metaphor for teaching people about PLR. So, let's say you go to the store and you buy a white T-shirt. Now you probably pulled it off the rack and there were probably 20 other of that same T-shirt on the rack, right? Well, you're going to buy that T-shirt. You can take it home and you can wear it.

[00:13:25.620] - Gina
And it's fine. It's totally functional. It's maybe a little boring, whatever. Maybe that's your style. Cool.

[00:13:32.130] - Gina
But like this arrow here, you're going to add a little bit of you. Maybe at work you want to throw on like a classic blazer and some trousers. And you're going to dress it up and it's going to work in a professional setting. Maybe you're going to throw on a denim vest and some funky pants, and you're going to go out with your friends to brunch. Or maybe it's going to go under a cardigan with a scarf, you kow.

[00:13:54.110] - Gina
It's just going to be like your teacher look for today. Whatever your personal style is, you're going to add it to the white T-shirt. So that means that even though there are those 20 T-shirts and how many stores are selling white T-shirts out there, right? There's thousands of people out there wearing white T-shirts today, but you wouldn't know that they're all the same white T-shirt because of the presentation, because everybody's adding their own style and flair. And that's what you're going to do with PLR to make it your own.

[00:14:22.960] - Gina
Here's our PLR store. Just want to give you some examples. This happens to be our home category, and let me talk to you about spinning it for your own style. So, let's say you want to purchase pantry organizing tips. This is an article that would work for lots of different niches.

[00:14:39.570] - Gina
So, if you were a minimalist, you might add in some information about how to keep your pantry organizing minimal. You don't want to be overflowing. You don't want it to be disorganized. You might even put in a principle or something like that. But if you're a blogger who deals with preppers, you're going to have a completely different take on this.

[00:15:00.240] - Gina
And you're going to be talking about shelving, and you're going to have your affiliate links in there for all of the things that you can buy to hold your cans and all of that kind of thing, right? And then if you're a food blog, you might use this in a different way also. So, depending on where your niche is, it could be very different. Let me give you another example. The storage tips for small bedrooms.

[00:15:22.460] - Gina
If you blog for older people, maybe empty nesters who are downsizing their home, you're going to come at this with a slightly different angle than somebody who runs a blog for college kids who decorate their dorm room, right? Those are very small bedrooms. They can use the same information that's in this article. You're just gonna gear it differently for your audience. So that part is really important.

[00:15:48.310] - Gina
Anytime you buy PLR, you don't want to use it the way it is. You can technically use it the way it is, but we really recommend that you don't do that because then it's like that white T-shirt. It's boring and plain in it, and you're going to find it somewhere else on the Internet. All right? So, in step three here, we're going to talk about all the ways that you can change up PLR. And when you download the worksheet when you're done here, we have all the steps on there for you as well.

[00:16:14.430] - Gina
Right? Before we hop into the next section. We could just take a second, if you could hop over to that chat box and let me know what's your content niche. When I do this presentation live, it's really fun to take somebody's niche right there who's in the audience and figure out how to spin some of the PLR that we're using for examples.

[00:16:32.310] - Gina
I'm going to do the best I can just with the examples that I have. I am going to be here in the chat with you while you're watching this live, and I'm also in the Facebook group if you end up having questions or you're trying to figure out how to make PLR work for your niche. All right. So, let's head into this next section. This is really the most important thing. So, once you get that white T-shirt, once you buy that piece of PLR, what are you going to do with it?

[00:16:56.130] - Gina
There's so many things you can do with it. It's not just blog posts, okay? Once you buy a piece of PLR, it is yours. You own it. Let's say you bought it from me.

[00:17:05.160] - Gina
It's not going to have my name on it. You don't put my name as the author. You put your name as the author. You are going to use it however you'd like. You can chop it up, let's say it's ten ways to reorganize your pantry.

[00:17:18.740] - Gina
You could make that into a ten day email challenge, and you could take each paragraph and send one every day to your followers, so that they canva complete this challenge. Or you could take those ten steps and turn it into a digital product, like a worksheet or an ebook that you can sell. You can totally do that with PLR. You can also use it for a full blog post. Obviously, one of the best ways to use PLR is for comparison and reviews.

[00:17:45.840] - Gina
In order for your articles to be found on Google, you know, they need to have a great word count. We start our articles at 750. We're aiming for you to add enough to get them to a thousand. Some people like their stuff even longer, so you can buy PLR to help bulk up with quality, some of your blog posts that you have. You can take parts of PLR, break it up, and do those cute little images that people put up on Instagram, you know, with the quotes.

[00:18:11.000] - Gina
You can use them for Facebook shares. You can use them for video scripts or podcast outlines. I've even seen people purchase PLR because they blog in another language, and so they take the English version, and then they just translate it, and it becomes a new blog post for them. It's also a really easy way to get optins, so not the text so much, but you can purchase PLR that's printable, like I said, like checklists, like a budget checklist or a 2023 calendar or something like that. There's a lot of PLR out there, okay?

[00:18:43.620] - Gina
There's videos, there's lots and lots of text articles. There are all kinds of things that you can purchase. So, let's go ahead and show you an example. I'm going to go back here to our store and we're going to pick on this article over here the Ten Best Accessories for Your Instant Pot. This happens to be our best seller, so I thought I would use it as an example of how you can adapt and use this.

[00:19:08.610] - Gina
So, here we go. I am in a Google Doc just to make it easier. Obviously, you canva do this in WordPress if that's how you're doing it. So this is what it looks like when you get it. It is just an article.

[00:19:20.010] - Gina
It's got the ten things here, the steamer basket, the silicone tipped tongs, so obviously, the first thing that you want to do is put your affiliate links in here. Listicles are a fabulous way to use PLR because you get your intro paragraph. You've got your descriptions right here. It saves you so much time.

[00:19:39.410] - Gina
You just go in here and whoever you're selling for, you put your affiliate links in there. Don't forget to add your disclosure. I like to throw that in there too. So that's one of the main things you can do to add to this PLR. Another thing that's super easy to do is change the number.

[00:19:54.950] - Gina
Maybe you read through here and you disagree with some of them. You could knock this down to seven accessories. Maybe you're that minimalist blogger I mentioned before. Maybe you're going to say you really only need three. But here's ten.

[00:20:06.840] - Gina
The other thing you can do is double it. Maybe you have other accessories that you recommend. You're going to go ahead and follow this structure, find your accessories that you like, and go ahead and put your one or two sentence description and you're going to change this to 20 best accessories. That's a really easy way to change it. While we're up here at the title, let's talk about keywords.

[00:20:28.830] - Gina
So, the first thing you'll want to do when you buy the PLR is figure out what your keywords are going to be because you're going to want to change this title. If everybody buys this and publishes it as Ten Best Accessories for Your Instant Pot, then there's a whole bunch of those out there. Now, that's not the end of the world. I mean, think about how many chocolate chip cookie recipes are out on the internet, for goodness sake. And they're all called chocolate chip cookie recipes.

[00:20:52.580] - Gina
But let's say you are a, like I said, a minimalist blogger. You're going to be coming at this article from a different point of view than somebody who is like my audience, which is super busy moms that just need to get dinner on the table. So, maybe our instant pot focus is going to be like dump it in and go. So, it's funny because for me, I would probably write more about the accessories that just make things go faster for you. Like I don't know that I think it's on here, the.

[00:21:23.430] - Gina
Oh, yeah, the cheesecake pan. I know there's tons of food bloggers that do lots of recipes about how to make cheesecake in your instant pot. That doesn't work for my audience. That is just too much trouble and it's too fancy. I would take that off this list because it just doesn't fit my particular audience.

[00:21:40.360] - Gina
And then that would knock this down to nine. So that's a change. Whatever your keywords are, if mine is going to be the most, now I'm having trouble thinking of it, the most necessary instant pot accessories. Or this could be a gift guide for people who love their instant pot, you know those people that are out there, right?

[00:22:02.340] - Gina
You want to figure out what your keywords are and you want to make sure you put your keywords in this opening paragraph. That's the main way that Google will not consider this duplicate content with somebody else who happens to buy and publish this article. What I tend to do personally is just get rid of the whole intro because I don't want to use it and I write my own IN my own voice. And that way I know that Google will not see this as duplicate content. Alright, so another thing that you can do in something like this, that's a listicle that's really easy, is just move the paragraphs around.

[00:22:33.470] - Gina
Why don't you you know put them in order of what you think is the most important. Or you could put them in order of what they cost. That would be another option. You put them in alphabetical order. This article doesn't happen to have any H2s, which are really important for your SEO.

[00:22:49.520] - Gina
So that would be another thing that you can do. Maybe down here, I can do. Let's see my top accessories and I'm going to make this in H2. You know how it works in WordPress, right? Then over here, I'm going to put in my affiliate link.

[00:23:10.290] - Gina
That's going to make it be underlined. All right. And I can read through this and just briefly see if it sounds like me. This really doesn't take very long. I can just scan through here and see if there's anything I want to add.

[00:23:24.360] - Gina
The main thing I would suggest when you're adding to PLR is put some personal experience in there. So, if I've used, which I have, I've used silicone tipped tongs. It's the only way my kids will use the instant pot because it's so darn hot. So, I might throw a line in there about that why I think that's a really important thing that you have because it's the easiest way to get your hardboiled eggs out of there, right? Another way to make this very much your own is to add some images.

[00:23:52.950] - Gina
So, maybe since I do have silicone tipped tongs at home. I will take a picture of my own with my own instant pot and throw that picture in here. Even if you end up using stock images with your PLR, there's lots of ways that you can edit the stock images, which now that I think about it, they're just like PLR, right? They go out to the masses, they're all over the internet. But there are ways that you can edit those stock images to look different than other people's.

[00:24:17.030] - Gina
Alright. So, another thing that you want to do is, like I said, add the word count. If there's not a conclusion, oh, here's a conclusion paragraph. You want to add things like related articles. Let's see, I would probably do something like my top five instant pot recipes.

[00:24:36.740] - Gina
This would be another H2, because you want to make sure that you're linking to your other content, right? This is already going to make it different than somebody else's. And now I'm going to go ahead and put in my recipes that are on my blog that are like the easiest ones. I'm going to put those right here and link to those. So, not only are you adding text and bulking up your article for SEO, you're also interlinking to related topics on your blog, which is also really good for SEO.

[00:25:04.940] - Gina
And then don't forget about external links. So, typically, I would do that. Let's say it's a recipe. I might put it somewhere else I might talk about. Let's see, let me look through here.

[00:25:16.610] - Gina
I've got a friend who does only instant pot on her blog and maybe she, let's see, where's a good one.

[00:25:28.140] - Gina
Like I don't have a tempered glass lid. So, if she's got a recipe that shows the lid, then it might be a really good place to link to one of her. This versatile lid has three great uses and then it's for slow cooking like this beef stew. And I can link out to her. So that's a great way to do it.

[00:25:49.360] - Gina
I said I would get rid of this one. You can get rid of paragraphs. We are going to give you a worksheet that has all these tips. I just wanted to share that it doesn't take too much time, especially once you get in the hang of it, when you're buying PLR. Don't forget to add your images.

[00:26:05.270] - Gina
Let's see, you can again, this is if it's a blog post, this doesn't have to be a blog post. You could purchase this and you could put some of these into an email that you send out when people are cooking for the holidays. And you're going to say, hey, you need these top three things and you can just cut and paste these right into your email. These would also be great little shares on social media. Like you could put that in a Facebook post or in your Facebook group and go ahead and put your affiliate link.

You could also take this whole thing and make it an outline for you to do a short form video on Instagram or TikTok, reels, YouTube, whatever it is. You know, on YouTube, you can put all of your links underneath. You could link all ten of these items and you could just talk through this article. This gives it to you.

[00:26:57.260] - Gina
You don't have to think too hard. You can just show pictures like slides or whatever it is you do for your YouTube videos. We've given you the script right here. Alright? So that's another way to use it.

[00:27:09.180] - Gina
Let me make sure I've covered all the things here. I tend to focus on how to use them as blog posts because that's how I tend to use them to save me the most time. But there are obviously lots of other ways. All right. Let's go back here.

[00:27:23.790] - Gina
All right. We highly suggest that you don't use PLR the way it is. And that's because somebody will, I guarantee it. Somebody will cut and paste it exactly the way it is. And you don't want to have duplicate content like them.

[00:27:38.670] - Gina
So, we're sharing our system for easily adapting the PLR and that's what we consider our secrets. Our worksheet is going to have the ten things that you absolutely need to change to make it your own. Once you get the hang of it, it really doesn't take that long and you can get really good at taking these three and four dollar articles and turning them into ready to go blog posts. Alright. So, now that you know about done-for-you content and you know a little more about PLR, here's what you can do next. Look ahead on your content calendar.

[00:28:11.340] - Gina
It's the beginning of the year still. You're looking ahead at what you're going to be publishing and what type of PLR would help you. Are you going to be looking for blog posts? Are you looking to beef up your email newsletters this year? Are you looking to put out a digital product in the next couple of months?

[00:28:27.750] - Gina
Do you need more graphics? Do you need printables? What are the different things that you need as you look at your content calendar for the year? Try to identify what kind of thing you're looking for, so then you can search for that relevant quality PLR. The worksheet that we give you has over twelve fabulous places where you can get high-quality PLR that we recommend.

[00:28:47.660] - Gina
Obviously, we will be on that list too. And then the last, you're going to take that worksheet and adapt the piece of content to work for your niche, your audience, and your voice. So, remember, even though multiple people can buy that same done-for-you content, it comes out as a different result. All right, I am here for questions. I am also in the Facebook group and in the chat.

[00:29:09.840] - Gina
If you're watching this live, if you are watching the replay, I hope you'll come over to the Facebook Group. You're going to get our worksheet. If you sign up for our emails that give you the top tips for using PLR, what we think you should always change, we are always happy to help. We've got our email at the bottom of that worksheet. If you feel really stuck because you can't figure out what kind of PLR would work for your niche and your audience, we would love to help you.

[00:29:33.870] - Gina
You can just send us an email or contact us in the Facebook Group. All right. The other thing that you get as a special bonus from us is when you download the worksheet, you'll get a code for a free piece of PLR content from our shop, the shortcut PLR Content Shop. Michelle and I made this because we wanted lifestyle bloggers like us to have access to very high-quality, done-for-you content they could use on their blogs. Everything that we have runs between 3 and $7.

[00:30:03.900] - Gina
You're going to pick one thing for free. Again, if you don't have any idea which one would work for you, we would be happy to make some suggestions. Plus, we're going to give you lots and lots of links to other people that we know are selling high-quality PLR. It's the same kind of thing. It's recipes, crafts, printables, all kinds of text articles.

[00:30:24.920] - Gina
You will find blog articles if you're a travel blogger, a parenting blogger, pet blogger. There's something for everybody. Everybody sells slightly different things. We will help you find what you need.

[00:30:37.190] - Gina
We really will. Thank you so much for being here. I am really excited to help you learn how to use PLR and I hope everybody will sign up for our email, so you'll find out when we have new PLR. And I'm really excited to see you in the Facebook Group. Thanks so much for being here.
