Hey there. Are you worried about getting a scary letter from the IRS or from the government in the mail when you start your new blogging business? Well, fear not, because today I am here to give you that Finance 101, that tax 101 manual that you wish you would have gotten in the mail instead when you start your new blog and you're working to make money from it. We're going to fix that fear and that overwhelm and that confusion and that mystery together today. Hey there. My name is Janet LeBlanc. I'm the founder of a business called Paper + Spark. I'm a CPA that provides financial education and bookkeeping resources for creative entrepreneurs, artists, makers, and bloggers like yourself. And today, I'm thrilled to chat with you about Finance 101, particularly for new bloggers. So, for baby bloggers who are just starting their blogging journey and their new business journey, I know that there is a lot of confusion and overwhelm on this topic out there, or maybe just a lack of information. And it's not the sexiest topic I will admit. It's probably not the most fun thing you're going to learn about during the summit, but it is really necessary.

[00:01:26.910] - Janet
And I'm going to make it quick. I'm going to break it down in plain English. And I can guarantee the best part is that once you learn this stuff, you're going to feel so much better. It's not rocket science. It's easier than we think it is. So, we're going to learn all about getting those financial ducks in a row for your new business, whether you've even considered a business or not. And we're going to feel more confident so that you can move on to writing, marketing, and making a whole lot of money with your blog. Right? Sound good? Let's go. So, let's figure this out. Is your blog even a business? What do I have to do or be or how much money do I have to make in order to actually be considered a business? So, again, I'm a CPA here in the US, so, a lot of the tax rules that I'm going to be talking about today are going to be related to the US only. Keep that in mind if you're located outside of the US. But here we have something called the IRS, the Internal Revenue Service. They're the people that are in charge of our federal income taxes, both for you on a personal level and your business.

[00:02:33.770] - Janet
And in the eyes of the IRS, it's all about your intent when it comes to running that blog or doing that online activity. Are you running that activity with the reasonable expectation of earning a profit? You don't actually have to be earning a profit yet. You don't have to hit a certain sales or net income threshold before you're considered a business. Again, in the eyes of the IRS, they're really just concerned about your intent. So, if you're here today learning about blogging, setting up your blog - maybe you're already blogging, maybe you're running ads on your site or trying to make affiliate income, or you're considering having printables or digital products on your blog - if you're running that website with the goal of making a profit, then you are considered a business and you want to be acting accordingly. There's not a sales threshold we need to hit, like I said. So, I really encourage you to treat it like a business because it probably is from day one, and that's what we're going to talk about today. And I'll also mention that even if you're doing this activity and you don't have the reasonable expectation of earning a profit, and you're considering this like a hobby and not a business, guess what? We still have to report hobby income for tax purposes. We don't get to just fly under the radar if we don't consider it a business. So, either way, you want to be prepared to deal with these tax responsibilities.

[00:04:08.390] - Janet
When I say I want you to get your blogging biz legit, what do I mean? I mean operating legally from a government perspective. That means the local, state, and federal government. We have different things going on at different levels. That means knowing what to expect at tax time. When is the tax deadline? What forms do I need to be prepared to file? Who do they go to? There's, again, different things we have to be aware of. Keeping your business stuff, and by that, I usually mean your business funds, your business money, separate from your personal stuff, and running your business like a business. That's really all about having that business mentality, making smart decisions, taking time to look at what's going on behind the scenes of your business, and not just operating willy-nilly. So, this is your basic Finance 101 checklist. I'm going to have a really detailed free checklist for you to download at the end of my presentation today, but sum it up that these are like the financial cornerstones you want to be prepared to deal with when you're getting your new blog business legit.

[00:05:19.850] - Janet
We want a business bank account. We want a bookkeeping system for our blog. We may need a state sales tax permit if what we're selling is subject to sales tax if you're selling some product. I'll talk about that more later. You'll probably need a "doing business as", it's a DBA or an assumed name license with your local county or city. You may want to go ahead and register for a free EIN, that's Employer Identification Number, with the IRS. That basically replaces your Social Security Number when it comes to all things business paperwork. And you want to know when your different financial deadlines are and what reports you need to file. I'm going to dive into most of these things in more detail, but this is the overall concept you want to be ready to tackle. So, let's talk about banking. You want to have a separate bank account for your blog. Why? A few reasons. It just makes doing your books easier. So, when you go update your blog's books, you don't want to have to be crawling through personal and business transactions in one place. That takes a really long time to sort through stuff.

[00:06:38.720] - Janet
You want to have all your business transactions in just one easier place. In the unlikely event you ever do get audited by the government, it also makes the audit process a lot smoother for both you and the auditor, and we always want to be in an auditor's good graces. It helps you make better financial decisions. So, I can log into my business bank account at any time and see how much money I have in the account. If I'm funding the business and co-mingling the personal and business money in one account, it's hard for me to see how much the business is making. If I'm at a profit or loss or not, I'm going to accidentally pay for things out of my personal funds, that sort of thing. It's also just often the legit business thing to do. If you are going to register as an LLC, you definitely are required to have a separate business bank account. If you're going to be a sole proprietor, then it's not necessarily legally required of you to have a separate business account, but I still highly, highly recommend it. In this day and age, there are plenty of free online business checking account options like Bluevine or Novo. So, there's really nothing holding you back from opening that business checking account for your blog.

[00:07:51.830] - Janet
Let's move on to Bookkeeping. So, Bookkeeping is just a fancy word for keeping track of your transactions in some sort of system, the ins and outs of money in your business, your sales, and your expenses. Bookkeeping is logging those sales and expenses every month, ideally, in some sort of system. There's no best system for me to recommend. The best system for you is whatever clicks best with how your brain works. Because the most important thing with the Bookkeeping system is that we keep it updated consistently. I see so many entrepreneurs wait until the end of the year to update their books, or the week before the tax deadline to update their books. It's a really stressful process, and you are missing out on deductions, because there's no way you can remember everything that happened over the past year and have receipts for all of that stuff if you're stressed for time doing it right before the deadline. So, pick a Bookkeeping system that works well for how your brain works. You understand it. You can visually see everything you need to do. You understand how to use it and update it consistently.

[00:09:03.780] - Janet
Set up those healthy habits. Like I said, I would aim to update your business books once a month is a good goal. And set up some system around keeping your digital and physical paperwork. By that, I really mean your receipts, your invoices, organized. If you do happen to decide to sell physical inventory as part of your blog business, like if you're going to sell shirts or something or prints for instance, you want to make sure that your Bookkeeping system, whatever you choose, also allows you to track physical inventory and cost of goods sold. Not all easy, simple, newbie Bookkeeping systems do that, so I just want to point that out in case it applies to you. Bookkeeping allows us to see where our different streams of revenue are coming from. So, as bloggers, you're very likely going to have different arms of your business. You're going to have money coming in from different places. You may be having ad income, influencer income, or affiliate income. You may have digital downloads that you're selling. You may be working with brands and having collaborations, so you want to be able to record all the different streams of income and easily see how each arm of your business is doing.

[00:10:19.970] - Janet
That means we've got to be tracking it in our Bookkeeping system. A good Bookkeeping system and keeping it up to date allows you to know where you want to focus your time and energy, and you can pivot and tweak your business model when necessary. If we don't have this data, we just can't make the best decisions. We're relying on our feelings or our emotions instead of the actual data, and sometimes our feelings may betray us, but the numbers don't lie. Right? And you want to have those totals, the margins, the KPIs, the good metrics in order to make smart decisions for how to run your blog and use your time wisely. A good Bookkeeping system is also really important for keeping track of your deductions. We don't always have a lot of expenses as bloggers. If you're not selling physical products, it may be harder for you to get as many deductions as you want to get at tax time. So, keeping track of your books consistently really means that you are going to be able to maximize taking all the deductions that you actually qualified for throughout the year. And by deduction, I mean a business expense.

[00:11:29.840] - Janet
So, when you're updating your books, you want to make sure you always remember to track your business expenses. Those are things that are ordinary and necessary in the course of running your blogging business. So, that could be things like the education and training that you're signing up for here today, if you buy the VIP pass, for instance. It could be your website and domain fees. If you're paying for your domain; if you're paying for web hosting, your cloud hosting; if you're paying for any other sorts of training; if you're paying for marketing or advertising like Google ads perhaps; if you have credit card processing fees that you pay when your customer buys a digital download from you, these are all things that we can deduct as business expenses. Keywords that we're looking for for a tax deduction or a business expense that we record in our books are ordinary and necessary for running your business. Okay. That's what the IRS is looking for. It has to be an ordinary and necessary expense. So, I know sometimes, especially with blogging, things can get a little fuzzy with buying food for recipes or buying clothes for modeling on Instagram.

[00:12:43.400] - Janet
Ordinary and necessary in the course of running your business is the filter that you want to pass all those expense questions through. A good Bookkeeping system means that you'll have those numbers that you need at year-end to do your taxes. Here are a couple of Bookkeeping options that are popular for bloggers. We've got QuickBooks Self-Employed. We have Paper + Spark Spreadsheets, that's my business, so I'm a little bit biased. Some people use Wave, which is another software option, or you can even DIY, open Google Sheets and track your sales and expenses in there yourself. At the local level, the one thing that you may need to look into at the local level is a "doing business as" or a fictitious name permit. We call this either a DBA, a fictitious name permit, or an assumed name permit or license. Different areas will call it different things. This is basically a registration that tells the public, notifies the public and the government that you are running a business under a name that's different than your legal name. So, if I ran a business that was just called janetleblanc.com, that's my name, then I don't necessarily need a DBA.

[00:13:58.480] - Janet
But I run a business called Paper and Spark. So, if your blog name, your brand or business name is different than your legal name, you're guilty or the local government body where you are, likely requires you to have this DBA, fictitious name permit just to let everyone know that your business is actually you, even though it has a different name. This may be something that you need to look into to check off your list in getting legit.

[00:14:27.860] - Janet
Let's move on to taxes. So, these are state and federal-level taxes here. The main type of tax we need to be prepared to deal with is income tax, and income tax is at the federal level with the IRS. And if your state has income taxes, then you also are going to be dealing with income tax at the state level. As part of income taxes, you may also owe self-employment tax. This is like the equivalent of what your employer, if you have a regular day job, would withhold from your paycheck each payroll period. This is our version because we don't have payroll as self-employed people, so we pay that as self-employment tax instead.

[00:15:11.430] - Janet
We have income tax on our net income, so that's sales minus expenses. I'll dive into this in detail in a second. Estimated quarterly taxes is if you are going to prepay your income tax bill, so only if you expect you're going to owe. And then totally different animal here, we have sales tax. So, sales taxes are governed by your state's Department of Revenue. Not every state has sales taxes. But if you do have sales tax, it's usually only going to be applicable to your business if you're selling products. Physical products, 98% of the time, are subject to sales tax. Digital products are subject to sales tax in about 50% of the states here in the US. So, if you're not selling any sort of physical or digital product, if your income is mostly going to be affiliate, advertising, influencer, brand collabs, that sort of thing with your blog, then you probably don't need to worry about sales taxes at all. If you're going to be selling digital downloads, you need to figure out if digital products are subject to sales tax in your state or not. If you're going to be selling physical products, then most likely you definitely need to deal with sales tax and get your sales tax permit.

[00:16:34.580] - Janet
I have more resources about sales taxes on my website. It's really complicated, so I don't want to dive deep into that topic here in order to keep it brief and brain-friendly for today. So, if you have more questions about sales tax in your business, feel free to reach out. Let's talk about income taxes, though, specifically, Federal Income Tax. So, we've established that you're a business if you are running your blog with the intent or the reasonable expectation to make a profit. If you're a sole provider, which you default to when you are a single person running a business, there's not a partnership, or if you're a single member LLC - you got that LLC registration, which you generally don't need to do as a baby business - but in case you already have, then you're going to be wanting to fill out the Schedule C at tax time. Schedule C is the tax form that you want to be prepared to deal with to report income taxes for your blog. It goes with your personal tax form, the Form 1040, and it's due on April 15th with your personal taxes. So, It's not a separate thing that you file apart from your personal taxes, or you and your family or you and your spouse's taxes. It goes with that.

[00:17:50.710] - Janet
The Schedule C is a two-page form. I encourage you to Google it, print it out, look at it, get friendly with it. If you see it now, then it's easier to do your books each month because you have a better idea of what you're going to be asked to report on that form. Those are the things that you need to be tracking each month so that you have the year-end totals to go here on the Schedule C. We could dive in-depth into each line on the Schedule C, but I'm going to give a brief overview again. Look at it on your own when you have time. It boils down to basically reporting your sales. So, all those different revenue streams we talked about, those are going to be your income in part one of the Schedule C. And then you get to subtract out all your expenses, those business deductions. So, you want to see what type of things they're asking for: advertising, office supplies, professional services, all sorts of things. You can look here and see what sort of deductions you want to be tracking. And then later on, we subtract the expenses from the income you reported.

[00:19:03.940] - Janet
And the net result is either a net profit, meaning you made money, or a net loss, meaning you spent more than you made. The end result of that calculation, that net profit or loss, will travel over to your personal Form 1040. It's going to get added to any other income you make. Or if you're reporting married filing jointly with a spouse, it will get added to their income as well. So, your blog isn't going to be taxed in a vacuum all by itself. It gets added to and lumped in with whatever's going on in your personal finances as well. I mentioned that we have sometimes a debate between, is my blog a business or is it a hobby? I just wanted to point out this form, the Schedule One, also goes with your Form 1040. If you're considering your activity a business, then that Schedule C net profit or loss will travel over here to line three. They do change the line numbers every few years, so don't be alarmed if 2023, 2024 ends up looking different. And then you put your hobby sales. If you don't consider yourself a business and you're not filling out that Schedule C, you still have to report those hobby sales over here on what is currently line through 8J.

[00:20:26.370] - Janet
But the trick with the hobby sales is you don't get to subtract your deductions, okay? So, it's not super beneficial to treat yourself like a hobby. You want to be considering yourself a business so that you can subtract those expenses. And then you just put the net result here on part one. All this gets added together if you have anything else to report here, and it travels from line 10 over to your main Form 1040, where again, it's going to get lumped in with your personal financial situation. So, that is a broad overview of the basic steps to getting your financial ducks in a row for a new blog business. We want to be prepared to deal with that Schedule C at tax time, that's the biggest thing. We want to be keeping track of our numbers and our bookkeeping system year-round so that we know what to report. You may need to get that local level DBA, "doing business as" license. You may need to get a sales tax permit with your state. Those are basically the big things, and getting that bank account. I think a lot of times we have this question mark of how do I officially become a business?  Do I need to register, fill out some paperwork?

[00:21:41.680] - Janet
When we start selling online or making affiliate income online with that intent to make a profit, you default to being a sole proprietorship, if there's one of you. If you're doing it or you're doing someone else like a partnership, you would default to being a partnership. But that's usually not the case for blogging, right? So, I just want you to know, there are not necessarily hoops you need to jump through other than the ones I've mentioned to officially be considered a business. Bottom line, when you start making money online, the federal government wants to know about it. They want their piece of the pie. No surprise there. So, don't necessarily think you can fly under the radar until some magical event or threshold happens. This is what you need to be prepared to deal with from the beginning. What are some things we can do to make this easier? Get that Bookkeeping system and possibly an inventory system set up. Start doing that research now so that you can start tracking those numbers in a system that works for you. Get educated on what we need to track and record throughout the year.

[00:22:58.920] - Janet
Look at that tax form. If you're not filing the Schedule C, figure out whatever form you are going to be filing and get familiar with it now, not a week before it's due. That's going to be really stressful for you. Set yourself up for healthy Bookkeeping habits. That may be making checklists, sending alerts on your calendar or in your phone on the first of each month to go update your bookkeeping system. Bribing yourself - 'Once I update my books, I can get a massage' - or whatever you're easily motivated by. Save throughout the year for your tax bill, if applicable. So ,if you think you're going to owe at tax time, you want to be setting that money aside throughout the year, so you're not hit with any surprise bills, and get proactive. Anything that I touched on today that felt confusing to you, write it down. Make a plan for how you're going to get that question answered. Hopefully, it doesn't involve just like going down a Google or Facebook forum rabbit hole. Reach out to an accountant, or you're welcome to reach out to me. I think we have a Facebook group that we can chat in for this summit.
