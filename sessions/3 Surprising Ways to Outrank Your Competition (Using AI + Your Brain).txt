Hi, everyone. Welcome to the Blogger Breakthrough Summit. I am super excited to be here today. I'm Niki Robinson of Post by Ghost. Today, we're going to talk about three surprising ways to outrank your competition using AI plus your brain. Let's get started. The first way that you're going to outrank your competition is to understand what's happening with Google and LLMs lately. And I know it's been a mess, but bear with me and I'll explain where we are and where we're going. So I think it's important to note that Google is still the largest traffic referrer on the Web. Let me show you what I mean. So looking at this chart, we can see that Google refers 64% of all traffic on the Web. So I just want you to get your head around that because what I'm saying here is that Google is the Web's largest traffic referrer of anything, like any other platform, any other social media, any other thing. Google is what is going to be driving the most traffic. So you might be seeing that this chart from SparkToro is from January of 2024, and now we're at a year later. How has this changed?

[00:01:19.480] - Niki Robinson
That is a great question. We don't have specific numbers yet, but there's a lot of things that we can tell very easily right now. First of all, let's just look at the timeline. Chatgpt was November of 2022. Then we had, let's see, Perplexity in December of 2022. Perplexity AI is an AI search engine. Yes, it has been around that long. Then we have, let's see, Microsoft Copilot, which was like Bing Chat, which was February of 2023. Then we've got ChatGPT with Bing, which was September of 2023, and Gemini, which is also Google was December of 2023. What I'm saying is that AI, Large Language Model, Search Engine results have actually been a thing for a year before this chart was even made. Then also now, as we are here later, we just had the release of ChatGPT Search, which was October 2024. What we're seeing is, yeah, people are diversifying. People are using these AI, LLM, integrated search tools. But what I'm saying is the adoption rate has not been as quick and as effective as they want you to believe. Plus, Google has dominated the scene for 20 years. It's going to take a while for Google to be replaced by something else.

[00:02:48.290] - Niki Robinson
I'm saying this now because I didn't think this necessarily a year ago. I thought this was going to look a lot different, but Google has shown that it has the staying power. The reason that I'm pointing this out is because Google guidelines still hold true for a lot of the best stuff that's going to rank. I know we're all very frustrated with how things are going right now, but what I want to tell you is you're not actually competing against Google. You're actually competing against all these really crappy AI-generated content sites that have popped up. So the proportional share of your traffic might have gone down, but the traffic is still coming from Google. So we need to get back on the board and we need to make sure that we are still showing up in Google, but also that we're showing up for all these other AI search engines, including AI overviews, including ChatGPT search, and all of that stuff. So what I am saying is that it's all still search. No matter what people are using, if they're going to alternative search engines because they're not happy with Google, they're still using search engines, right?

[00:03:48.010] - Niki Robinson
I think we just need to keep that in perspective and also just keep in perspective what tools people are using and the fact that they're still using them to get to websites. So let's look at some examples. So granted, some of this information This is anecdotal because it's coming from me, but I have been testing different traffic patterns and paths for lots of our clients, as well as major sites and stuff like that over the last couple of years. And here's what we're seeing, okay? So this is one site that I wanted to use as an example. I'm not going to tell you who it is, but anyway, what you can see is a few things. So here we have 2023 views and users. Here we have 2024 views and users. What you're going to see, search traffic, one and a half. This is actually, I should point out that this is a range within the last three months, basically. 2023, we've got 1.5 million, and then 2024, we've got 1.2 million. You can see that there's some search traffic that has gone away. However, let's look at the numbers here. If we just look at the percentage of traffic that only came from Google, out of all the search traffic, the traffic that came from Google search was 96% in 2023.

[00:05:03.790] - Niki Robinson
In 2024, it was 95%. What this tells us, and this is a number that I've repeated across a number of experiments, is that Google is still the lion's share of search, and that includes these AI search tools and such. While AI overviews in Google are still experimental and they're still playing with those things, there's still a bunch of core updates that have just happened and that are coming, I'm still telling you that Google rules the roost, and it probably will for a while. One interesting thing that you can also see with traffic patterns is what has come in from tools like ChatGPT, Perplexity, and some of the other things that I mentioned, realizing also that Gemini is still Google. In 2023, we've got one person who showed up from some large language model. 2024, we're seeing an uptick. Totally cool. That's definitely what I've been seeing. Cross the board. However, this is This is not a massive amount of people proportionate to the amount of traffic that we're getting here. This is not a... This is a... This is one email to your list. I mean, this is nothing, basically, is what I'm saying. So these tools are coming on the scene.

[00:06:15.480] - Niki Robinson
They're definitely being used. They're definitely going to have more adoption. But right now, Google still rules the roost. So one thing I'll also say is despite the fact that this site had a downtick in search, in 2023, 56% of all traffic to this site came from Google. In 2024, 54%. So again, despite the downtick and what have you, we're still looking at a massive amount of traffic that comes to this site from Google. So whenever we can make Google happy, we still want to do that. Now, I have said for a really long time that Google's guidelines are definitely what Google aspires to be, not what Google is. If you caught my talk last year, I'm pretty sure I said that. I probably said it the year before, too. The thing is, is those guidelines still hold true. But But we can also use large language models to figure out how Google is thinking about things and therefore how to show up more frequently when our users are looking for our content. Google's algorithm is a little bit of a runaway thing right now. It is a black box. Google has never known or understood exactly how it works, but nevertheless, they're still trying to figure out better ways to show real content to real users who want it instead of AI-generated crap.

[00:07:29.950] - Niki Robinson
This is going to be a long process. Let me just give you some options about things you can do to mitigate the large language model situation and where we are right now. Raptive, the Ad Network, formerly Ad Thrive, has an article here that's quite helpful about how to manually block common AI crawlers. However, they did get a few things wrong, and I want to address that. Also, this person has the same name spelling as me, but it is not me, so just FYI. Okay, so here's this section that says how it works. Basically, in your robots file, which is the file that tells Google what to look at on your website, and other crawling bots, it tells them what to look at and what they can look at and what they can't, you want to rule out these user agents that are crawling your site so that they can use your content to train large language models. There's a few problems with this if you haven't moved on it yet. One, all of these models trained on content that was out there without telling us how to do this in the first place. Basically, if you have had a site that has been out there for a while, it is highly likely that your content has already been used to train models and there's nothing you can do about that.

[00:08:45.050] - Niki Robinson
The other reason that this is not super great is because, yeah, you can disallow these different specific bots, but if anybody else generates any other bot to train any other model, which will certainly happen and is already happening, if your site is on the Internet, it can be crawled, scraped, and used to generate AI content. So essentially, I'm not sure that this is actually even that useful because the other side of it, too, is that your robot's file is a suggestion. All of these things are still indexable. This is just saying, Hey, if you could just not, that would be great. But it doesn't mean that these bots actually have to follow these rules. The other thing is that we want to be careful that we don't disallow something, meaning block them from the website, site if they're going to play into some of these other AI search models. What you're going to see down here in this article is an explanation of what these different user agent bots are that crawl your site and then absorb your content into their large language model. What you're going to notice here is this, which I found very interesting.

[00:09:53.370] - Niki Robinson
Chatgpt bot. You can block ChatGPT from using your content for their large language models by putting this disallow command in there for the ChatGPT bot. However, you're going to look at this here. It says, ChatGPT bot also includes ChatGPT user, which is necessary for a site to appear in Open AI's web-enabled searches. But the traffic from this source is currently so minimal that we still recommend blocking this user agent. Because we are just on the cusp of ChatGPT releasing search, despite the fact that these AI search engines have existed for a long time, ChatGPT search may prove to be one of the more popular ones. Right now, I'm torn. I don't like that these large language models have absorbed all of our content and are using it to plagiarize our good stuff and make crap. I hate that. My team has written thousands and thousands and thousands and thousands of articles, and they are all really good and they've been stolen. That said, I don't I want to reduce the possibility of showing up in search wherever. But there's another interesting part here. So what I did was I took a look at a Raptive site that had and currently still has these things blocked in their robots file.

[00:11:18.260] - Niki Robinson
They're blocking everything here. It's set up pretty much exactly like this. I went on to ChatGPT search, and I searched for things that were on this website. And not exactly to my surprise, but many of the things that are on this website showed up, even though they have this ChatGPT bot blocked. So I went to take a deeper dive and to figure out what's going on there. So in this case, I actually asked ChatGPT, and it gave me an answer that actually made a lot of sense. So the red line, that is the Raptive site that has the ChatGPT bot blocked. So I said, Hey, this site has the bot blocked. Why does it show up here? Meaning in ChatGPT search. It says it's configured its robot file to disallow certain kinds of web crawers, including those used by ChatGPT. This means that ChatGPT's web Crawler ChatGPT bot is instructed not to access or index the site's content. However, ChatGPT can still provide information about the site through other means. User inputs, so if anybody wants to share your information or if they're doing competitor research and they plop your stuff into the model to do that, which is some of the stuff that I'm going to show you how to do, then your stuff has already been absorbed into the model and there's nothing you can do about that.

[00:12:38.090] - Niki Robinson
Then additionally, this publicly available data, item number 2 here, it includes a wide range of publicly available information up to September of 2021. If their content was accessible on the internet before this date, it may be part of the model's knowledge base. Basically, that means there's a window of time in which the AI model was still absorbed absorbing the content well past September of 2021. Basically, if you put these commands into your robots. Txt, it's not going to retroactively remove you from any of these search engines. If you're still deciding on it, it's like, I don't know what the point is anymore because basically we only knew how to do this after it was too late. It's pointless, honestly. If you're blocking this bot, you are blocking showing up in the recently released ChatGPT search. I just think that blocking yourself from any search engine is going to give you worse results than if you actually participate. The other somewhat ironic part of this as well is that when you block your site and your content from large language models, it means that the large language models do not train on your content, which means that the same large language models that help Google determine which content is the best then will not be trained on your content and how you put words together.

[00:13:59.340] - Niki Robinson
Just something to think about. However, the jury is still a little bit out on this, so you can use your own thoughts, opinions, and experiences. It is up to you. That is my take. I just want to make sure you all have the full picture. Number two way that you can outrank your competition on search is to use ChatGPT to group keywords and create outlines. I'm going to show you a couple of ways that I've been doing it. However, I'd like to make a point, and that is that ChatGPT can be finicky, and sometimes you have to play around with it to get it to do the right thing. Sometimes you can give it the exact same prompt over and over, and it is going to give you different results every time. That's why you want to be really specific with your prompting. I'm going to give you some ideas, and you can expand upon them as you please. What I like to say about ChatGPT is that 60% of the time it works every time. This is an Anchorman quote. Moving on. Here's a couple of things that you can do to help with your content creation using ChatGPT.

[00:15:01.960] - Niki Robinson
Here I have an example from a manufacturing client. Essentially, this is a really simple prompt, but what ended up happening was we did a ton of keyword research, we did a ton of competitor research, and we found this giant glob of keywords that we want to rank for. Essentially, now my task here is to take all these keywords and break them down into an ideation, into what are we going to write about? What are the big buckets? When I look at these keywords, what are the big buckets of things that we want to talk about? So essentially here I said, I'm going to give you a big glob of keywords, and I want you to sort it into the specific categories that I'm going to provide. So essentially I have, here's my glob of keywords, and then I have, here's the categories that I want them to fit in, and then it's going to break down the keywords into the buckets that I provided. So the other thing about this is that you don't have to provide the buckets. You could also tell it like, Hey, I have a glob of keywords. Can you please bucket into groups, into specific topics?

[00:16:03.990] - Niki Robinson
In this case, I gave it the buckets, and then it grouped the keywords accordingly, and it told me actually if there weren't any keywords that were applicable to any specific category. Then I also told it to plop the remaining keywords in an other bucket if they don't fit into the categories. This works pretty well. Similarly, we can basically give it a bucket of our competitor keywords and ask to give us, tell us what the competitor is writing about the most so that then we can take over those rankings. And so in this case, just uploading a plain old spreadsheet. This is just a list of keywords from a specific website. I just uploaded this document. You can do that in ChatGPT by using the little attached file here. I just plopped that in here. I said, I'm going to give you a file with competitor keywords. I need you to break out the specific recipe ideas. So now I'm going to show you how ChatGPT can help you outline your content as well. Unsurprisingly, I am not really pro-AI content. It's going to sound formulaic. If you don't know how to tell ChatGPT how to write your content, it will come out as poorly as whatever you put in.

[00:17:19.630] - Niki Robinson
If you're not putting in something good, that means that you need to go back and work on your writing anyway. I frequently say use ChatGPT to help you explore topics, to help you group ideas is to help you outline. But when it comes to writing, if you want content that's going to give you traction, it needs to be more unique than the content that ChatGPT produces. I'm going to step by step show you how to form an outline using your competitor's content. So right now I'm on Martha Stewart. I can only hope to establish as much domain authority as her. However, I looked at this, How to prune your orchids, and I'm taking a look at this content and I'm going, you know what? I think I can do better than this. I have more information to share about this than is shared here, and I think I can add more to this conversation and not just regurgitate what someone else has done, which is essentially what ChatGPT does when it writes something. Okay, I'm going to show you step-by-step how to do this. I'm a huge fan of Keywords Everywhere. This is the Chrome extension that you can grab to try it.

[00:18:23.480] - Niki Robinson
The thing is, is Keywords Everywhere is no longer free. However, it is really, really cheap. Basically, the stats are something like the average person spends $10 a year, so it's definitely worth it. What I want to do to start planning my orchid post and get my brain going is I want to look at what this post is already ranking for. To do that, I'm going to use my Chrome extension and I'm going to click this Organic Ranking Keywords by URL, and that is going to give me this list of keywords that this post ranks for. There's a lot of good high volume keywords in here. This looks like a really good opportunity for content creation. All I'm going to do is download this as an Excel file, which you can do simply by clicking the button here, and that ends up as a spreadsheet like this. Now, I didn't touch this spreadsheet at all. All I did was give it to ChatGPT with a few instructions. Here's what that looked like. I did this a second ago and it didn't save the graphic, but I'll explain that in a second. But basically it says, Hi, I'm going to upload a list of keywords and I'd like you to help me generate an outline for a post on the topic.

[00:19:28.030] - Niki Robinson
This is just the... Again, I used the attach file. It's literally just the spreadsheet I just showed you. I uploaded it. Then, and again, this is the 60% of the time. It works every time. In this case, it actually did parse out the keywords from the list that have the most potential. And then it asked me, do you want to focus on one of these or do you want to write it about everything? Well, to compete, I want to write about everything. I want this to be a comprehensive long form guide. I literally said that and then it gave me the outline. So here's the outline. Introduction, Orchid Anatomy, essential tools, how to prune, pruning techniques, best timing, troubleshooting, long term care, FAQ, conclusion. Oh my gosh, does AI love conclusion? That's another obvious trait of AI content is a lot of the time at the end, the H2 will be conclusion. No one does that. Here's the thing. This is going to help you incorporate all those keywords. This is going to help you jog your brain and organize your thoughts to try to get it together. You do not have to follow this exactly.

[00:20:38.190] - Niki Robinson
You may or may not include every piece of this, but this is giving you a pretty comprehensive overview of how you can write a piece of content, use those keywords, and do a more in-depth guide than Martha did. Our last and number three way that you can outrank your competition is to supercharge your keyword research with Google's predictive text and topical maps. Let's dive in. Okay, so let's say I'm searching for Anchorman, the movie. So I search for Anchorman. Hit Enter, and I've got Anchorman. I've got information about the movie. I've got the cast. I've got watch the movie. I've got reviews. I have all this information right here. Great. Cool. Now, let's say that I'm like, oh, yeah, Christina Applegate was in that. I want to learn more about her. The thing is, is once I go up here and start typing in Christina Applegate, I just put in the letter C-H and it brought up Christina Applegate right away. And the reason for this is because it knew I had just searched Anchorman. There are tons of other Christine, Christina's, etc. Lots of other C-H names, as you can see here. The first one it shows me is Christina Applegate.

[00:21:45.630] - Niki Robinson
Similarly, if I go to Will, Will Farrow is showing up. So what I'm saying is that you might be hearing things about topical maps in SEO. Well, what Google's predictive text is telling you is that it's telling you that it knows that these entities are related to each other. And whenever you can draw those parallels between your entities, meaning interlink them really good with good anchor text, that is playing into Google's model and helping Google understand how your text is related, as well as helping you show up and search for related types of content. Look at this. I put in best. What comes up first? Best comedy movies, best comedies, best Anchorman quotes, best comedies on Netflix, Will Farrell. All this stuff is giving us like, this is the next phase of what we want to write about here. We want to connect all these dots. I was just talking about topical maps. This is another strategy that you can use that basically plays upon the same technology that autofill Google's predictive text to give you a map of all the topics that you want to talk about within your blogging niche. In this case, please provide a topical map for topics related to Anchorman, the movie.

[00:23:02.120] - Niki Robinson
You can see right here, Creating a topical map for Anchorman, The Legend of Ron Burgany, involves breaking down themes, characters, settings, and related cultural impact points. This will provide a structure for potential articles, blog posts, and SEO-rich content. Here's a detailed topical map. And truly, this is like the simplest prompt I've probably ever written. Sometimes that's all you need. When we look at this, let's say I'm doing a niche site and it is only about Anchor Man, this is going to give me a map of all of the topics that ChatGPT and therefore other large language models understand as interrelated. Each of these things are entities. The noun, each thing that composes this topical map is a related entity. That is like, for example, when I went to search for then C. H. Christina, the first Christina that shows up is Christina Applegate. It's because Google knows that this content is related. When you play the same game with your content, it means that large language models, which is how Google operates, will understand your content, how it's interrelated, and therefore pull you up on rank. Here, look at all these things that we have to write about.

[00:24:09.330] - Niki Robinson
These could individually, easily be their own articles. We've got main topics, We want to do the plot. We want to talk about the characters, quotes and catch phrases. Each of these, that's an individual blog post. Themes. We can talk about the themes of all of these different things in the movie. We can make a unique blog post for each one of these and interrelate it with the other content. Behind the scenes, production and filming, etc. Cultural impact, lasting legacy, sequel, related media, pop culture and parody opportunities, audience and fan engagement, and then it actually plopped some SEO-driven questions and ideas. If you are looking for something that ChatGPT does not provide on your first shot, again, it's a conversation, so just ask for it. Say, Do you have any other SEO-driven questions and ideas? It's probably going spit something out. This plays into your internal linking structure as well. Anchor text is the blue underlined highlighted text that links to another page. This is a great example of how they've connected their topics together. What we have is the anchor text for this link is important to your plant's health. What you want your anchor text to be is basically a short, keyword-rich summary of where that person is going to go if they click the link.

[00:25:27.390] - Niki Robinson
If I hover on here, I can see that this goes to common house plant problems and what to do about them. So related to plant health, you are telling Google that you have content that is related to this because it's related to plant health. You're giving it a specific map to show that these two pieces of content are related and you're bridging that divide with the anchor text. You can see lots of other examples on this page, New York Botanical Garden. That is an off-site link, but very effective. This is a good backlink for New York Botanical Garden because you're getting it from a high authority domain like marthasteward.com, and it's going to link to the main homepage website of the New York Botanical Garden with this very rich anchor text that explains exactly what it is. This is literally the perfect backlink. Most importantly, though, we really want to give our readers a clue where they're going, and that is going to help Google connect the dots. Again, your anchor text is your bridge between your entities that's going to help Google and users to navigate your content better. Because good anchor text and internal link structure are truly ways to supercharge how you rank on Google.

[00:26:37.980] - Niki Robinson
Thank you all so much for joining me. I'm Niki Robinson from Post by Ghost. It's been a pleasure to speak at the Blogger Breakthrough Summit, and I look forward to speaking with all of you sometime soon. Thanks.
