Liz Stapleton [00:00:00]:
Alright, guys.

Liz Stapleton [00:00:00]:
We're here with Jen from Jen Williams Agency. I'm super excited for the session because she's gonna be talking about systems for your business. Welcome. Thank you.

Jen Williams [00:00:09]:
Hi. Thanks for having me. So to give you, really quick what we're gonna be going over today, Basically, we wanna talk about the very basics of the system. So everyone here is you need system. You know, you hear that you need automation, you need process. What does it actually look like when you're at the stage when you're ready for it? Because there's hundreds and hundreds of options when it comes to systems. So what are the ones to focus on in the beginning that actually propel you for growth and are sustainable for scalability? Because there's a lot of them that are really cheap in the beginning, but then you can't use them later on because then you spend hours switching over platforms or whatever it may be. So we're gonna focus on the 2 different versions of systems and what are the actual best softwares to use when you're just starting out and to propel you for growth.

Liz Stapleton [00:00:57]:
That's awesome. Yeah. Because I feel like when you're, you know, attending summits like this Right taking blogging courses or whatever, you always you learn something, and then it just adds to your to do list, And it gets longer

Liz Stapleton [00:01:08]:
and longer.

Jen Williams [00:01:09]:
Exactly.

Liz Stapleton [00:01:10]:
You don't systemize. Like, there's no way you're gonna you're just gonna end up burnout, and we don't want that. So I'm really excited for your presentation. I can't wait to watch. Let's go ahead and dive in.

Jen Williams [00:01:20]:
Hello. I'm really glad you're here with us today. So today, we're gonna be talking about building systems for business growth. And let's go ahead and jump straight in so you can maximize your time today. So everything we're gonna be talking about today, who I am and maybe why you should listen to me, what systems are. So when you hear the word system, what are we actually referring to? How to scale your business, so scaling versus actual growth and what the difference is. Growing with software because you need automation and delegation and all that to be able to actually scale. How to choose the right tools because there's a million of them out there, and we all hear they're all right.

Jen Williams [00:01:59]:
So how do you choose the ones that are actually best for you? What processes have to do with systems and how they can actually help? And then what are just some insider tips that I've gained through all these years of using them that can help you so you can bypass that and jump straight into using them like a pro. So let's go ahead and jump in. So this is me. I'm Jen Williams. I'm the CEO of Jen Williams Agency. We are an operations firm, and so I consider myself an operations authority. I have been doing this for quite a while now. I have a bachelor's in business administration, a project management professional certification, and I'm also certified in by the American Marketing Association.

Jen Williams [00:02:39]:
And I am personally on a mission to completely eradicate burnout from business. I am obsessed with owning my own company. I love it. I knew I wanted to be an entrepreneur from day 1. But if you don't know exactly how to run the operations, the back end, the behind the scenes stuff, it can be completely overwhelming. And we live in a a world right now that really promotes this hustle, the hustle nation as we call it. And you can get completely burned out if you were out there hustling every single day. And so there's this other side of the world, the the entrepreneur world that is completely bypassed.

Jen Williams [00:03:17]:
And that's what do we do to prevent burn out. So it's kinda what we're gonna talk about today in regards to systems because that's mainly why we use them, to make everything behind the scenes, run nice and smooth, operate nicely so that you can go ahead about your business. You can focus on the activities that bring in revenue, that keep you in your zone of genius, but then also keep your company really profitable and running smoothly. So I actually spent 9 years in the corporate world. I was climbing the ladder, and the corporate world is just not for me. I was doing really good things in my career, but inside was very, very miserable. And I kept thinking I just need to change my circumstances. All I need to change is the department, and I need to change the company I'm with.

Jen Williams [00:04:05]:
I need to change my job title. And so I would move around. I spent between the 9 years with 2 different corporations, both very large corporations, and I was miserable in every single role I had. I was really good, and I got really good reviews, but I was completely miserable. So I went ahead and took the jump, the leap, and I went ahead and opened my own operations firm. And luckily, within 3 weeks, I was making full time income and replaced it because I had done all the prep work in regards to the education piece. I knew my material really well. I hadn't really done a whole lot of prep work for my actual business because I kinda just left.

Jen Williams [00:04:43]:
I kinda just took a big leap of faith. And so within 3 weeks, I was able to turn that around because my how I use systems, because I had everything in place, and I was able to get that full time income replaced within 3 weeks. So I had a really good, circumstance there and was able to really propel my business starting from the ground. I am a very, very big believer in work life balance. I absolutely love working, but I don't wanna work all day long. I love many other things. I love my family. I love reading.

Jen Williams [00:05:14]:
I love my hobbies. Many other things. I don't love just work. And if you only work if you only do one task, it might be okay for a while, and you might be able to keep chugging along for a while. But there's gonna be a point where you completely burn out no matter how much you enjoy that task. I'm a big believer in managing your work life balance because if you don't, it's gonna manage you. It's gonna control you. And so I am very passionate about this.

Jen Williams [00:05:41]:
And when I joined into this entrepreneurship world, I kinda noticed that a lot of people skated over that part. They really just promoted this hustle every day, hustle every day. And I'm just not that's not how I wanna operate, and I really wanna help other people learn to operate their company in a way that makes sense for them so they can be healthy too. And so that's why I started operations firm. That's where it all really came from and so I wanna talk today about what actually is ops. When I say the word operations, a lot of times people will look at me like, okay. But what actually is that? So it's all the stuff that has to do with running your business in the back end. So, generally, people start a company because they have one really good zone of genius.

Jen Williams [00:06:26]:
There's one thing you're really good at. Our example here, we'll use massage therapist. So someone who I have a couple clients who are massage therapists and they are really, really, really good at what they do. All the pieces that go into the back end of running a massage therapy business, they don't really know so much. And so they kinda just wing it. And maybe they'll Google some things. They're getting by and but things aren't there's not really systems. There's not really processes.

Jen Williams [00:06:52]:
That's where we come in and we kinda implement those. We also focus on a scaling strategy. And we'll talk about what the difference between scaling and growth is in just a moment, but not all business models are meant to be scaled. Not all companies, not all small businesses can scale the way they're set up. Yeah. You can change things. You implement. But not all of them are currently operating on a manner that allows them to scale.

Jen Williams [00:07:15]:
And I think that's a misconception because a lot of people think they are set up to scale, and all they have to do is increase revenue, and that's all it is. We'll talk about that in just a second. The biggest thing we do with operations is set up processes, implement systems, and create automation. And that's kinda like the the magic trifecta as those three things together that really creates really simple, nicely operating operations. So first, I wanna talk about systems. When I say the word systems, there's kind of 2 different versions that I'm talking to that people generally mean. The first one, you're talking about software applications. They are kinda like the building blocks behind the scenes.

Jen Williams [00:07:57]:
They're the things that run all the data. They're gonna be the pieces that run the automation. They kinda keep everything flowing and keep everything organized. The other type of system is in reference to creating processes. So So a system in reference to repeating the same thing over and over in the same manner so that it's efficient. That's the type of assess system that I'm referring to, and we will come back to that in a bit here. So using systems to scale. So what the heck do I mean when I say scale versus growth? So a lot of people under the assumption scaling just means increasing revenue, and that's not true.

Jen Williams [00:08:39]:
So you can have a company that increases revenue, but when you were operating on a basis of trading your time for money and so we go back to our masseuse example. She can only have so many clients per day. She can only have so many per clients per week. Even though she can increase her revenue, she's kinda capped at scaling. So she has to adapt a scaling model. And so a scaling model in that case would be maybe building out a team. That's a scalable model. Maybe you're gonna add in additional services that can be like group programs.

Jen Williams [00:09:14]:
That's a scaling model. And you're gonna add in a course on how other masseuses can open their own company. That's a scale model. So there's quite a few different options, but recognizing that just trading more of your time for money is not a scalable option. You're gonna be capped eventually. And so that's why the very first thing we do is we determine a scalable model to kinda shift things a little bit so that the company is scalable. So when we apply these systems, it can actually help you scale, not just increase your revenue. And when I'm talking about scaling large and systems, we we wanna make sure that any software you choose and any systems you create, so any process you create are scalable also.

Jen Williams [00:10:01]:
So you only wanna choose things that can actually grow with you. There are definitely a few exceptions. When you're first starting out, I think there's some things that will you will do that you recognize you're gonna come back and redo once you're at a certain growth. But mainly the the big things that you wanna do at the very beginning to help prevent all that time wasted later. And so the first one, so you definitely wanna have software that can help you scale. And then you also really wanna make sure that your business is based on your personality type. And I know that's not a common thing to kinda hear, but it really helps prevent that burnout. Because if you have chosen a business model that you have been told is successful, that it completely goes against how you operate inside your head and your personality type, you are gonna burn out even quicker and that company is gonna completely fail.

Jen Williams [00:10:56]:
And you're gonna be stuck at a frustrating point. Like, I thought this was supposed to be successful. What happened? You know? And so to help prevent that burnout, I highly, highly recommend everyone take a moment to kinda evaluate if the scaling model you've chosen really represents your personality. And that's kinda one thing we go through with clients. We make sure that they have chosen a scaling model that works well with them, that can run long term, is not gonna burn them out just by being present. So a good example is, a group coaching program. So let's say you're the type of person who gets really, really, really exhausted with people, and there's definitely, you know, strong introverts. I'm I'm a strong introvert.

Jen Williams [00:11:43]:
If you have to manage how much exposure you have to people every day so you can manage your energy inside your body, well, a program where you are back to back meetings with people is not gonna be it. So So maybe your program needs to look a little bit different rather than 1 on 1 work. Maybe it's a group, so you're exposed to if you're doing a group call where there's 50 people on the call versus a 1 on 1 call or something like that. You know what I mean? There's a lot of different manners, but you just need to take it into and make sure you're thinking about that. What is your actual personality type? Is the model you're choosing going with it or against it? Because a lot of people, I'll hear them say things like, oh, I can fake it for a little bit or I think it'll be okay. It's not really congruent with who I am, but I think I can handle that a little bit. And then I'll in the rest of my time, I'll do something I enjoy. Well, that'll work for a while, but it really will lead to burnout in the long run.

Jen Williams [00:12:42]:
So if you can stop now and choose now a model that works for your personality type, it can be much better for the long run. And so going back to the software options, when you're using systems to scale, there is so many software options and every single software pitches themselves as the only one you need and the number one in their category. And everyone talks about the soft current software they're using is amazing. So it kinda gives you this endless sea of options, and it becomes very overwhelming. You don't know which ones you should actually focus on, let alone which companies, which categories. I think that's a big one. A lot of people get so wrapped up in, should I go with Trello? Should I go with Asana? I never stop and think, do I need a product manager? You know? So is my company one that actually needs this type of category of software? And we kinda get that a little bit because we come from a we're in a world where everyone's pitching us the cure. Everyone's pitching their system is the the best system, and that is great.

Jen Williams [00:13:54]:
You can get a lot of information that way. However, it implies that everything is needed, and that's definitely not the case. So we definitely want to manage what is actually needed, what's needed for you, and what's best for your situation. So when I am working with someone and they are in the kind of the beginning stages, they have seen growth, they've seen revenue, and now they're really starting to kick it up in gear, they know they need systems. There's generally 3 places I recommend they start. I always say, ignore everything else, go with these 3 to begin with. These are the ones that are gonna help your business grow. These are the ones that are gonna help you scale, and you're gonna see the growth most growth with these.

Jen Williams [00:14:35]:
So first one is your business management software. This one is going to be the one that you send proposals with, that you can sign contracts, and you can send invoices with that generally has some sort of CMR built in, that generally has, some sort of project management task management, and we'll go through that in just a moment. The next one is a project management software. This is gonna be your task management working with the team, and the last one is your CRM. This is where be where you track all your leads and all your clients and all your future leads. And so let's go ahead and dive in and talk about the first one, the business management software. So the first system regarding your company, like I said, is business management software. What are what actually is that? It's gonna be a software that generally has more than one function to it.

Jen Williams [00:15:29]:
And the reason I recommend this from people who are first starting is because it's a really good base to start with that is very simple. It puts everything in one place. You don't need to learn 15 different softwares. You need to learn 1, and then I'll take care of a wide variety of stuff. Like I said, a lot of them have task management built in. Some even have project management built in, which is really great. They're gonna have some way to track your leads and your clients. Some of them have a client dashboard.

Jen Williams [00:15:58]:
Your clients can log in. You're gonna be able to send proposals, sign contracts. Some even allow accounting built in. Basically, it's a software that has a lot of different functions for small businesses. Some really good examples are Plutio. I absolutely love Plutio. It's the one I use myself. I really like them because they have not only task management, but a really robust project manager built in.

Jen Williams [00:16:23]:
So I actually don't need a separate project manager because Plutio has that built in. Not all of them do have that built in, but that is one that does. And I really highly recommend that Plutio. 17 hats and Dubsado are also amazing. They have a lot more features than Plutio, but the downside is they don't really have that robust project manager. But if you just need task management and what the difference is is project management is more for teams where you're delegating. Task manager is just a list of things you need to do. Those are really amazing options, and those have really robust options like, client dashboards, and they do have some automation built into not really robust but some, and so it's really awesome.

Jen Williams [00:17:09]:
I know Dubsado now has, like, forms built in and a scheduler. And so it really brings everything in one place and can make managing your business very simple. So rather than trying to figure out a software to do my accounting, a software to do my invoicing, a software to sign contracts, a software to send, my task management, It combines it all in one place and makes your life and your operations so much more simple. It also sets you up for growth because once you're at the stage where you're ready for a team, everything's nicely organized. They can easily hop in, and you can train them easier because you're only training them on one software. As you do grow, you will probably eventually need something more robust. And what I mean by that is when you have a software that offers all those different things, they are not going to be generally, they are not the best at every single thing they do. So a good example so Dubsado does proposals.

Jen Williams [00:18:11]:
They do amazing proposals. Those are definitely what you need in the beginning. But if you have a sales heavy company or you are sending tons of proposals every week, you're probably gonna wanna eventually move on to a proposal only software that offers 100 and 100 of features and and automations, stuff like that. But you don't need that until you are making way more revenue. You don't even need to touch that. You will probably have, like, a team of 10. You'll probably be making over 500,000 a year before you need that, stuff like that. Because a business major software is definitely gonna suit your needs for now and as you scale up.

Jen Williams [00:18:50]:
But I do want to rep I like to do mention it to people that you will eventually need a more robust one, And that's kinda what leads me into the next 2 recommendations, kind of setting you up for that. So and I also wanna recommend or mention, it's not just about cost when you're comparing them. So when you're trying to figure out which one, it's not just about pricing, but about the features they offer and about how much time it saves you. Because the back end of your company is it takes a lot to run everything. They say, generally, for every hour of client work you have, you have an hour of back end. So if you were doing 20 hours of client work a week, plan on 20 hours of back end a week also. It can get very overwhelming. And so when you have a nice system set up, that can really help decrease the amount of hours you're having to throw into that.

Jen Williams [00:19:40]:
So that leads us to the next one. When you have start to build out a more team a bigger team, so you've gotten revenue and you've gotten to the stage or you're kinda focusing more on, like, the revenue generating stuff, now you're building a team, you are definitely gonna need a project management software. If you go with, business management that have, like, Plutio where you have that project manager built in, that's great. But if you do not have one, now you're gonna be at the stage where you kinda wanna start looking for project management software. Some people set this up from the very beginning, and that's absolutely great, definitely worthwhile. So some common ones are, like, ClickUp, Teamwork, and Monday. These are my 3 favorite that I recommend. Out of those 3, Teamwork is my absolute favorite.

Jen Williams [00:20:24]:
Teamwork is very robustly built. They really it's user focused when they were building it, and you can really tell, the way they have the landing pages and the dashboards and all that was really thought out with the user in mind. It makes very logical sense, you know, where to click and how to send stuff to other team members, and they have a lot of integrations from other like like Google Drive and Dropbox and all that. It makes it very seamless. It makes delegating work very quickly. It makes organizing projects really easy. There's a lot of templates you can use. There's built in automation.

Jen Williams [00:21:04]:
It just makes everything very smooth. Makes running a team very, very efficient. So one so couple things you wanna look for in a project manager, you obviously want task management. You wanna be able to sign projects and tasks. But even more importantly, you wanna look at your ability to communicate. You wanna be able to communicate on a task level, so you wanna be able to make comments on the task. You wanna be able to communicate on a team level, so maybe, like, a conversation or, like, a Slack or chat type feature, stuff like that, which Teamwork also has. You wanna be able to include lots of your own content in it, so you don't wanna be limited to how many, like, projects you have.

Jen Williams [00:21:49]:
And you also want to be able to handle a lot of different variety. And so what I mean by that is you don't wanna pick a software where it's really good for client work but not good for external work, stuff like marketing, stuff like that. So a really good project manager allows you to combine both of them and has it set up for both. And then your next piece of software that you're definitely gonna wanna have and wanna develop is a CRM, a customer relationship management software. And so I highly, highly recommend HubSpot, Zoho, or Capsule. Zoho and HubSpot are amazing and you can do so much with them, but very overwhelming. So if you want something that is really, really good and very simple to use, I highly suggest starting with Capsule. Capsule integrates with a lot of other companies, softwares, have a lot of features, but it's quick to learn.

Jen Williams [00:22:46]:
It's very easy to learn. And so, basically, why you want this is so you wanna be able to very easily manage every time you're communicating with your clients, with your leads, with people on social media before you get to leads, you know, stuff like that. And it's really important that you are managing these and that you have a system set up because you wanna be able to not automate your responses but automate the quality control. Because without that quality control piece, stuff falls through the cracks and you get terrible client experiences, and it can really hurt your company in the long run. So it's not just for the sales process, which it is very useful for the sales process, but also for the client experience process. Now when you're first starting out and you're using a business management software like 17 Hats, Dubsado, and even Plutio, they do all have some CRM built in, and it's definitely fine from the beginning. Once you have a lot of leads and once you have a lot of clients coming in, you want a more robust CRM because you wanna be able to manage them all efficiently. You don't have to be doing a lot of leg work yourself.

Jen Williams [00:24:02]:
So there are quite a few other options for softwares. But like I said, these are the 3 I recommend starting with. And of the 3, I recommend starting with the business management software. That's really, really gonna change your company around. It's gonna completely clean up all the back end stuff. It's gonna make it a lot more simple because you're all doing it in one place. And then once you get to the point where you have a bigger team, you have more sales, you need the other softwares, move on to project management and CRM. And those are the 3 you should be focusing on.

Jen Williams [00:24:32]:
Those are gonna be your biggest bang for your buck. Those are the ones you wanna invest your money in, stuff like that. Maybe use the free versions for anything else that you need, but these are the 3 that are gonna be worthwhile to spend money on. So how do you choose the one that works for you? So it is kind of a scary experience. This is the number one thing I hear from clients is I just don't know what to choose. And so I do wanna walk through a few things to help you choose the right tools for your company. So first off, I want you to list out what features you need ahead of time because I will tell you this. There's gonna be tons of features that you don't need.

Jen Williams [00:25:10]:
There's gonna be when you're doing your research, you're gonna come across a lot of other stuff and you're gonna get sidetracked because it seems awesome that it has this cool feature. But if you don't need that feature, you are gonna completely waste your money on it, your time on it, and your time is better spent with other revenue producing tasks rather than using it buying and using a software that you didn't even need that certain feature for. So I always suggest start with a list of actual features you need. Then head over to g2.com. They have really amazing side by side comparison. So you can look at the different software tools and see which ones have those features and kinda compare pricing and features from there. Like, again, I said don't get too distracted by features that you don't need. They will hurt you in the long run.

Jen Williams [00:26:03]:
You can think ahead. If so, maybe you're at a point where maybe you're not even sending proposals yet. Your company is brand new, and you're not really even handling that yet. But you probably you know your company is gonna be heading to that very soon. We'll work that into the consideration too because you don't wanna take the time to set this up and then a week later, oh, now you need that feature. So and the last one is always make sure they have automation because like I said, automation is gonna be what saves you in the long run. It's gonna save you all this time. Make sure they have automation because not all of them do.

Jen Williams [00:26:36]:
And so it is a key function that you definitely need if you want it to be scalable. Now if you are a company of 1 and you are very, very happy not choosing a scaling model, then that's a 100% okay, a lot of freelancers are that model where they aren't really trying to adapt a scaling model, they're just growing their revenue and they're very happy, that would be a really good example where maybe automation isn't a 100% needed. It still could be beneficial, but not a 100% as needed. So remember when we were talking about that other type of system and I was talking about systems as processes? I wanna come back and briefly talk about that. So why is it important that you create processes? Processes are what saves you time in the end. And, basically, a process is anything that you do repeatedly in a set format. Anything that you repeat more than once and you're gonna do the same way each time. You've thus created a process.

Jen Williams [00:27:36]:
And so why is that important? Well, it's important to do it the same way each time for quality control, for efficiency, and to kinda work out the kinks in the system to work out if there's anything wrong with that process. And if you haven't documented it or you haven't at least acknowledged it's done the the same way, it can be really hard to work out those kinks, and that's kind of where those bottlenecks come in. That's where you get the frustrations from customers or you're frustrated and kinda leads to burnout is having basically, like, organization for all the tasks you do is a good way to look at it. So I do recommend creating your processes, and I recommend documenting them. And there can be a couple different ways you can actually type out all your processes on, like, a word document. But even an easier way is just to record yourself doing them and then using that as a reference guide makes it a lot easier. So like I said, processes can really help with streamlining because there's a kind of a magical thing that happens once you start the documenting process. It's kinda like when you're teaching someone else, you recognize you you see that from a different angle and you recognize the the pitfalls, the error the errors and stuff like that.

Jen Williams [00:28:58]:
And so it helps you create a more efficient process naturally by just the act of documentation. It helps create consistency. So especially anything that has to do with clients, that's always where I suggest starting with process creation is anything that has to do with clients. Because when you've created a process the same way of doing the task, you create consistency, and you can now deliver value to your clients on a consistent basis. So everyone's getting the same level of quality from you. I do highly recommend creating your processes even if you are a company of 1 because what happens is once you grow and you are you have the team members and a team underneath you, you're suddenly at the stage of business where you're so busy you don't have time to create those processes. So right now when you're a company of 1, it's very easy to go ahead and stop and use them and create them then. So I do recommend creating them at that point.

Jen Williams [00:29:55]:
I I do wanna go through a few tips that I have that I've learned over the years. I've created hundreds and hundreds of process for people. So kinda and I set up software for people. This is kinda the tips I kinda wanna go over. So first, I always recommend write down a list of all the tasks you do each day. Take all those tasks that you've done, group them together in function. These are what I call departments, and a lot of people are like, I'm just a company of 1. I don't have departments, but you do.

Jen Williams [00:30:24]:
Accounting, marketing, management, stuff like that. So divide them into your functions. Assign all the tasks that are in those functions priority. And so it can be as simple as an we just follow a stoplight procedure. So, you know, stop red, green go, slow, which is medium for us is yellow, and that makes it very easy to see. So you see red things, you know, stop. Green, you know to go. Yellow, kind of in the middle, you know, stuff like that.

So assign it all a priority. You can use a couple different prioritization systems, but that's the one stoplight method is kinda the one I like the best. Go and download an SOP template. There's tons of them out there for free. I have one on my website. There's other great ones also. And then create processes for all those tasks you have listed. I know it seems very overwhelming when you have that giant list, but just start one at a time and you'll fly through it.

Jen Williams [00:31:23]:
And then take them and create a catalog for easy reference. One tip I like to have to make is to, like I said, use video if you don't want to. So what I do, I know I'm already going to be doing the task. I will record myself doing it and then boom, use that as my documentation. It's a video SOP because it's already I I didn't have take any extra time to go ahead and produce that, and now it's already available. It's already recorded as an SOP for me. And so that is all of our building systems for business growth. I hope that really helps you learn what systems that you need, especially at what stage your business and what's right for you and how to go ahead and research what's right for you.

Jen Williams [00:32:10]:
And then also the other type of system, we're talking about process and why they're important and how to actually create them.

Liz Stapleton [00:32:17]:
Okay. That was fantastic, Jen. Thank you so much for sharing those tools and resources in terms of building out those systems. I know you do have a great free offer for everyone attending. Do you wanna tell them a little bit about it?

Jen Williams [00:32:31]:
Yeah. I still have a membership. It's absolutely free. It's called Change More Lives and we focus on getting your business scaled with its right strategy and planning processes and the organization behind the scenes. And we really focus on people who are really, really passionate about what they do and they're ready to spread their message, but they're kinda capped at that 1 on 1 client work. And so now they're ready to broaden their horizons and really expand into ways that scale beyond that 1 on 1 work and really wanna get in there and help as many people as possible. That's why we call it change more lives because we're really focused on reaching more people with your message.

Liz Stapleton [00:33:09]:
That's amazing. And it's it's a free membership, guys. Definitely go check it out. Go get it. The link is below the video. Jen, thank you so much. This is fantastic. I'm so glad.

Jen Williams [00:33:19]:
Thank for having me.

Liz Stapleton [00:33:21]:
Yes. So yeah. And and guys, remember, you know, you can always rewatch this for the next 24 hours. You can get lifetime access with the All Access Pass.
