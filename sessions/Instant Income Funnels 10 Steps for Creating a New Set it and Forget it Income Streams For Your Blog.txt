[00:00:09.200] - Kim Anderson, kimandersonconsulting.com
Hi and welcome to my presentation, so you may be wondering, who the heck is this chick if you've never met me before? My name is Kim Anderson from KimAndersenConsulting.com, and I have a six figure online business. I am a thrifty lifestyle blogger, Podcaster ,online business coach and traditionally published book author. I've been doing online business since 2013 and in 2017 my blog business made enough money that my husband quit his electrical engineering career. He is now bootstrapping a nano brewery in our small town.

[00:00:34.500] - Kim
In addition to all these things, I also have twins. They were born in 2016 and are growing and growing and growing, as well as my eight year old, very energetic son. So I definitely have my hands full as people like to point out on a regular basis. In this presentation, I just want to go through these 10 steps, like step by step. Hopefully this will be very actionable for you when we get through this presentation.

[00:00:59.820] - Kim
And I'm hoping some of you guys have some great aha moments that help you be able to create a new stream of passive income or more than one on your blog. So let's talk about step one. So step one is to understand the warm up process funnels, which is what we're talking about today, are the marketing strategy that helps you compel someone to take the action you want them to take. And in most cases, there are three types of someones that we're going to be dealing with as bloggers, and that is cold, warm and hot audiences.

[00:01:29.580] - Kim
And there may be a multitude of actions that we would like this people to take on a regular basis from likes, to followers, to subscribes, to sign ups, getting them to join our tribe or buy something. These are all things that we can try to get people to do. But today, we're going to focus on a funnel that gives every new subscriber the chance to buy a physical or digital product from you, which is very exciting. Let's talk about cold audiences to get started.

[00:01:56.310] - Kim
So these are people who come to your blog who may have no idea who you are. They may just kind of stumbled upon, like maybe your YouTube channel. Maybe they just landed on your website. They just found you on Instagram. Basically, they just learn that you exist and they don't know if they like you yet. And I made a note here under our little snowy friend that says these people are the hardest to get to take an action because you haven't really established a relationship with them yet.

[00:02:24.390] - Kim
Our next group is the warm audience, these are people who have probably heard about you potentially from someone else, maybe they've seen some of your content and they like it and they may have stumbled on you and stumbled upon you on Pinterest. And they're kind of navigating your Web site, looking around or reading your about me page, whatever it is.

[00:02:42.660] - Kim
But they at least like you, and they at least feel like they know of you at this point. So there is my note here under Mr. Smiley Friend, is that it's easier to get these people taking action because they may already like you and feel like they know of you.

[00:02:57.720] - Kim
Our last audience is hot audiences. These are true fans. These people love your content. They follow you.

[00:03:04.110] - Kim
They comment on all your videos or feeds, they actually like you. And they may feel like they may feel like they actually know you. And most importantly, they feel like they can trust you. And trust really is that game changer and getting people to buy what is that we are selling.

[00:03:19.680] - Kim
So I made a note under our super fan over here that these people are the easiest to get to take an action because they, like, know and trust you already. And I really like these are the kind of people that we want to cultivate, but we can't always control that variable on our websites. We will at all times have cold, warm and hot audiences visiting us and we have no control over that. But as we go into this process of better understanding how we're working towards getting someone to take the action we want them to take, I want to walk you through this as like a prerequisite, because it's something that you should always keep in mind.

[00:03:54.960] - Kim
Ultimately, we want to take our audience members from cold to hot, so I have this little pretend little funnel over here and you can see I've got the cold guy, the warm guy and hot guy.

[00:04:04.200] - Kim
And ultimately we're trying to get them to get them at this bottom point so they'll make some decision. So when we talk about like a really simple funnel for growing your email list and keeping it warm, you may have been familiar with this simple funnel that you may or may not be already running on your own blog.

[00:04:23.150] - Kim
So basically, a person watches, reads or listens to your content and that content is usually free value that you're giving away. And at some point in that content, you're going to call them to action, asking them to sign up for an email list, plus a freebie. This is also free value.

[00:04:42.580] - Kim
Then they sign up and in most cases, a lot of people will set up a welcome sequence, and so they'll send a three email welcome sequence to help them get that the audience to get to know you and also to deliver maybe some more high value freebies to continue to warm these people up.

[00:04:57.690] - Kim
And then we follow up with these people by sending weekly communications to keep the list warm until you're ready to sell something, so that's kind of a traditional little funnel where our goal is to get people to take the action of signing up for our email list so that we can stay in communication with them. But for today, we're going to really be focusing on this funnel, a simple impulse offer email funnel for increased passive income from your own products.

[00:05:21.120] - Kim
So the way this would work is a person watches, reads or listens to your content again for your value. You call them, take an action. Hey, sign up for my email list, get my freebie and other free value. Except now they sign up and they are redirected to an opportunity to buy one of your products or a bundle of your products at 50 to 80 percent off. Hopefully 2.35% or more will buy your impulse offer. So this is the funnel that we're going to be discussing today.

[00:05:49.690] - Kim
This is the 10 steps we're going to walk through and try to talk about how to build one of these out. And then hopefully when you're done, you'll be able to go build the process for yourself, whether you already have one set up or not. Maybe it's time to set up another. OK, step two is to decide on a freebie and product upsell. So, OK, so impulse offers give you the chance to sell something to every single new subscriber on autopilot, which is why I love them.

[00:06:13.610] - Kim
There's no launching involved. It's literally like you have an opportunity with every single new person who subscribes to your list to make a sale and is completely passive. And so in this section, I really want to talk about six types of freebies. I want to talk about the multitude of products that you could sell just to kind of get the ball and the ideas rolling for you here. So usually when I teach this concept, people will ask me, OK, if I'm going to make a freebie, I'm going to make a product.

[00:06:42.260] - Kim
Which one do I make first? So it kind of is that chicken and egg scenario I kind of laugh about here. So you can see that we've got our upsell and we've got our offer being our freebie.

[00:06:52.760] - Kim
And so I tell people honestly, like really it's a process of figuring out what's going to work best for you. And sometimes people will create their product and then they'll pull a freebie out of the product or they'll think of a freebie that is connected with that product and that's easier for them. And then some people need to start with the freebie and then create the product off of the freebie. So to be honest with you, it doesn't really matter. The key is for you to just pick one kind of work through that process on your own.

[00:07:26.180] - Kim
OK, let's talk about the five types of email freebies.

[00:07:30.170] - Kim
There's obviously way more than this, but for the purposes of what we're going to be learning today, I'm just going to cover these five main types so you can have a site wide offer, a category specific offer, post specific offer, challenges or topic specific offers, since I'm going to break each of these down really quick. A site wide offer is one general offer geared towards your ideal audience on every single page of your website. Category specific freebies is one freebie or offer related to each category that you write about.

[00:08:04.830] - Kim
So if you have a WordPress website or any Web site and you let's say you have four categories that you write about all the time, you would be able to create a specific freebie geared towards each category and then have that freebie appear only in the content related to that category. Then you've got post specific offers. So this is one freebie offer related to the content of the article that you wrote, and I think sometimes these are some of the warmest offers that you can make.

[00:08:35.880] - Kim
And you may see the highest conversion rates on these because they're so specific to that particular article that you're writing. And if that's the case, it's probably a good idea for you to evaluate in your process of picking what's going to be the post that you basically monetize in this fashion, would be the one that has significant traffic. So you want to look at the ones that are already getting good, decent traffic or regular traffic, especially from like Google and things like that, because in that article, you're probably providing some sort of informational solution that people are looking for and having an offer in there, plus the upsell.

[00:09:11.320] - Kim
May be a high converting opportunity for you, but those are just things take into consideration. Like, obviously, you know, don't go looking for like your lowest traffic post. And then spend a bunch of time building out a product for that, look for the ones that are already doing well. Next, is challenges, a time a set time period or measurable finish line to accomplish something, and you can do this in so many different niches. They'll, they'll all usually work, and what I've seen a lot of people do with challenges related to freebies and products is it might be like a seven day challenge or a 30 day challenge.

[00:09:45.920] - Kim
And then people actually package up all the materials they've created for the challenge over the course of the seven days or the 31 days.

[00:09:54.260] - Kim
And they sell that as their upsell. Like, you don't have to wait for all the information to come out through email, like you can get it all in this one thing, plus this workbook.

[00:10:03.050] - Kim
So that works for some situations. Then there's topic specific offers. This is offering something related to a specific topic that you write about.

[00:10:11.090] - Kim
And how is it different from categories? I sort of think about this as being almost like subcategories. So it's just more specific to the topics that you might write about. So if you write about let's say you write about fitness, maybe that's, like one of your favorite topics under fitness to write about is kettlebell exercises. And so kettlebell exercise might be the topic that you may make your freebie based on the product that you sell. People would based on, be based on kettlebell.

[00:10:34.430] - Kim
So it's just more specific. OK, so if you're thinking like, I got to come up with some freebie ideas, the key here usually is to keep it simple. And there's a lot of people online.

[00:10:45.040] - Kim
I teach a lot of different things about freebies and what to give away and how much value to give away. And everybody kind of has different philosophies on how that works. But in my experience as a blogger, keeping it simple is best. Something like a plans library. I've seen people do before is like if you're into design or woodworking or furniture making or something. SVGs for those crafty people who are doing cricket, silhouette machines. Checklists, printable tutorials, mini e-books, mini courses, it could be a workbook Eguide, printable planner, quick win type items, challenges, PDFs, videos, lists, anything that can be kind of done for you.

[00:11:25.280] - Kim
So like, you know, if you can provide them with the items that they need or should do or some schedule to follow or something along those lines where you're providing it sort of done. So products or services that you can offer are e-books, merch, Physical Products, Commission work, online courses, trainings, printable plans, online workshops, events, templates, anything again, done for you. So if you're making some sort of product like let's say you're in the fitness industry and you want to make a exercise plan that is available like a 30 day exercise plan or a 30 day meal plan where people don't even have to think about it, it's just completely done.

[00:12:07.800] - Kim
So the question is, how do you brainstorm your products and freebie offer like this kind of some of the questions that I get from people is like, how do I kind of figure out what I'm going to do? And so I want to kind of give you some ideas of how to get the ball rolling to figure out what you're going to do for your own blog.

[00:12:23.030] - Kim
So when you think about number one, what's the problem that your audience is dealing with, like when you think about whatever whatever freebie offer you're thinking about doing, whether it's in post or across your website or whatever, get to the root of the problem that you're going to be able to solve. And then. Try to create a product that provides a solution to the problem. And then the next thing you want to ask is, well, if I got, if I know their problem and I know this product is the solution, really, what's the best format for me to deliver this particular solution to the audience that I have?

[00:13:01.450] - Kim
So rule number one, make sure that your freebie connects logically to your products and you would think this would be a no brainer.

[00:13:08.440] - Kim
But I've seen a lot of people who are sort of like slapping the stuff together because they just want to get it up and see how it does.

[00:13:14.680] - Kim
But there's an important process here where your freebie needs to make sense for the upsell so you don't want to have a freebie that is like, you know, the mom's, mom soccer van cleaning guide and then the upsell to a mini plan or something like that, unless it's like specifically geared towards like the soccer moms mini plan, like it needs to have some sort of logical connection.

[00:13:41.790] - Kim
You know, if you're going to give away like, you're going to do a checklist, maybe the upsell is the for like the full set of, like, checklist associated with something.

[00:13:51.960] - Kim
Maybe if you're going to give away like a cheat sheet, maybe the upsell is like a mini e-book that explains all the concepts on the sheet and how to implement them. But like those concepts should connect. You don't want to have a bunch of random freebies with a bunch of random things, because when someone gives you their email address in exchange for that freebie, they're indicating that they're interested in whatever that freebie is doing for them. And so the next logical step is to give them another solution to that problem they've just told you they have by opting in with their email address.

[00:14:26.460] - Kim
Rule number two is make sure that your product is in a format that makes sense for your audience. I don't, this is such a hard one because, again, there's so much information online coming from all kinds of different people who have so many different business models about like what's working.

[00:14:42.300] - Kim
And so one of my biggest frustrations in the blogging world, especially with all I mean, I've coached over 400 people and this is kind of one of those things I see constantly is there's people who are like, OK, this guru is saying this is the new way to make money online or this is the modern, like this is the today way to make money.

[00:15:00.240] - Kim
So, for example, people will go out and they'll create membership sites or something because that's the new big thing. And when they launch into their list, they get zero sales and they get very frustrated. But it was because they didn't take a step back and ask, is my particular audience interested or going or willing to pay for our membership? And that's like a super important question to ask yourself, as well as courses like if you, for example, have an audience of busy, busy professionals, for example, whether it's men or women, and you're trying to deliver your product in a way that they'll be able to consume it, it might be easier for those people to consume something that is in audio format that they can complete, like while they're commuting or on the bus or, you know, on train or whatever it may be like.

[00:15:46.500] - Kim
Really think about your target audience and what do they have time for? How do you make that easier for them? So for me, and my particular audience thirty little mom, I've shifted into more PDF based things because they can open as PDF wherever they are, carpool line, sitting around the house and they're on their phone and they can open them and they can read them versus women who just don't, you know, they have kids at home or whatever and they don't really have time to watch a ten minute video. So video is not going to be effective for them. Whereas, you know, like if you are a person in a more DIY niche and your audience wants to see your how to videos, you know, like that's what they're there for, like they need to see you do that project and some video would be more effective for them.

[00:16:30.030] - Kim
But it's very important for you to consider what format makes sense for your audience so that you actually make sales. Step number three is to make your freebie and your products. All right. There's so many different ways that you can make your freebie and your product these days and so many tools that make it so much easier.

[00:16:30.030] - Kim
So you've got programs like Canva, Stencil, Google Docs, YouTube, where you can, you know, upload your video and make it private and then be able to share it in an email or PDF or link in the PDF, password protected pages or an online school platform. So to create pretty looking PDFs and printables, I really encourage you guys to get into a program that helps you make professional looking things, the current programs out there that a lot of people use and are familiar with our Canva, PicMonkey's come a long way over the years to try to compete with Canva, in my opinion.

[00:17:19.650] - Kim
I still like Canva a lot of people already have Adobe, so they just use the Adobe Design programs and stuff. And then they're Stencil, which is sort of another version of like Canva.

[00:17:31.710] - Kim
But these are just options. So I have this image here where you can kind of see like the different things you can do, in particular just to make a note.

[00:17:41.820] - Kim
These this the screenshots that you see is templates made by Kara Fidd from simplifying DIY design, but she makes these awesome templates that you can change out and switch out. So that is her work and I want to make sure she gets credit for the designs and stuff.

[00:17:59.650] - Kim
So the next thing you can consider doing is create pro looking courses, and I personally think a lot of people use teachable, Kajabi and Podia are also two other options. But, you know, if creating courses is what you want to do, you have the option to be able to build those on a platform like these.

[00:18:19.050] - Kim
The next step is to make the offers look good and make the titles compelling, so I think it's really important to create better looking product covers. Again, you can use programs like Canva and Stencil. If you're really proficient with Adobe and you're in into design, you can make a lot of different things that way. I don't know Adobe as well, so I just default to my Ecover maker because it helps make these 3D looking images that have the bindings on them or computer screens or anything else.

[00:18:49.950] - Kim
Like it's just a easy program and it's inexpensive.

[00:18:52.620] - Kim
It's like $4.95 a download. And they also have free options too. So spend time making sure that your PDF documents cover image is compelling because that is what people are often making a decision based on.

[00:19:10.230] - Kim
The next thing is to avoid white noise titles, and my best example of this is home binder. So if you look on the left, this is a pretty white noise thing, a home binder. Yay, so exciting. So to encourage you guys to use power words, use transformational words and consider using time frames when it's appropriate. So you can see how I take in this white noise title of home binder and tried to make it more transform transformational by calling it the Bad Ass Mom's Guide to Total Home Management in thirty five minutes, which is a lot more compelling than home binder, because there's a bit of a promise or there's a bit of an expectation to that title.

[00:19:48.210] - Kim
And obviously you want to be able to deliver on whatever you title it.

[00:19:52.140] - Kim
But it's a much more compelling offer when you spend time on the title of your product. Step five is to set up your payment and delivery. This is one of those interesting processes which is different for pretty much every platform that you use, but in general, sort of the process in case you're new to selling online and you've never really done it before. I think this is one of those areas people get very confused about how things work. And it just again, it depends on the program that you're using.

[00:20:22.930] - Kim
But for a lot of people in my circles of blogging, this is sort of the the way things work.

[00:20:30.820] - Kim
You will get a product and delivery software so you can see that you've got our shopping cart and checkout because that's what we need for the consumer to be able to use. And that usually, that shopping cart and checkout has a way to deliver. That's why it kind of runs along the bottom, because this piece is connected to get it right. So you've got your checkout and then your delivery truck on the other side. And then I've got this thing down here that has a little packaging.

[00:20:57.910] - Kim
It says, these delivery softwares will charge you a small fee, your monthly subscription fee. And some of the examples of the ones that are most commonly used in my blogging community is sendowl shopify, Leadpages, teachable, thinkific, ThriveCart. So these are some of the major product delivery options out there. And once you get them set up, you will have to connect them to a secure payment processor.

[00:21:22.960] - Kim
And some of the most popular ones that are the most widely used ones are Stripe, Square and PayPal. And I made a note. So there's a little Pacman here that says two and a half to three and a half percent fee for each transaction. And I think a lot of people get concerned about these fees and stuff. But if you're creating digital products, I joke about basically we sell invisible things.

[00:21:44.740] - Kim
There's not a lot of margins when it comes to PDF and things like that because you're not having to print it, package it, ship it or anything. Right. Like there is somebody else kind of doing that for you and so for me, for the convenience of being able to process those payments securely and know that consumers information is being kept safe by Stripe's, Square, PayPal and I don't have to worry about that on my end or my responsibility of keeping that information safe, I will pay these fees.

[00:22:17.770] - Kim
And I will set these things up. So this is just kind of an idea of how that works. So once you get that secure processor in there, people go to their shopping cart, which is connected to the secure payment processor, which is then delivered by your product delivery software.

[00:22:33.220] - Kim
Step six is to write your welcome and delivery email sequence. So obviously when someone gets a freebie or purchases something, you need to be able to deliver that thing to them.

[00:22:44.770] - Kim
Some people with freebies opt to have them delivered in the first email of the welcome series because it gets the person to open the email.

[00:22:54.160] - Kim
And getting people to engage with your email when it comes into their inbox helps to make sure that your, your, your email gets in their inbox again. And in the future, like it sort of tells you know whatever their email service provider is, "hey, this person engaged with email and must not be spam." So that's why a lot of times in my welcome sequence, my very first email is delivering the freebie because I want them to go open that, whereas I've seen a lot of people who, when they deliver their freebie, do it on a thank you page or something like that.

[00:23:24.340] - Kim
I want people to go into that email.

[00:23:24.340] - Kim
I don't want to give them the freebie immediately on the thank you page because I need them to check that email to make sure that I am being able to email them again in the future and that I'm not going to spam. So this is an example, email, welcome sequence, if you never created one, this is just an example. There are a million ways you could do this, but this is just something to kind of get your brain going.

[00:23:49.180] - Kim
In this case. I've got email one as a greeting, you know, delivering the freebie and telling them what they can expect from you and what's in it for them and the information about you. And I usually ask them to hit reply and say hi or answer a question, because, again, this helps to create engagement inside of those e-mail delivery services in hopes that that continues to help us get into their inbox on a regular basis.

[00:24:13.990] - Kim
Email number two, two days later, could be a quick email that you give something of value away for free, a video or a printable or something like that. Email number three, which can be five days after email. Number one would be a quickie, another quick email with another value add item like a freebie or a video or training or something along those lines.

[00:24:32.620] - Kim
And then email number four, you can add them to the weekly email announcements, set up an RSS feed, and so you're ready to email them with more personal note. But this is sort of just a general email welcome sequence that you can set up.

[00:24:46.550] - Kim
Step seven is to create your landing pages so there is different kinds of landing pages, if you're not familiar with what they are. You can create landing pages for your freebie as well as landing pages for your upsell. So I want to talk briefly about the benefits of landing pages, in case you're not familiar with them, landing pages are a little bit different than just regular pages that you would build in Gutenberg. So if you were to create a page in Gutenberg, unless you've got a little bit of coding background when you hit publish on that page, you're probably still going to have your menu at the top and your logo or whatever you have going on at the top of your page.

[00:25:24.170] - Kim
And landing pages are supposed to be very minimal, distraction free. So you can get rid of those menus and stuff. They're supposed to give a direct call to action.

[00:25:35.780] - Kim
You should be able to keep it simple, like when you're especially when you're doing the freebies with the blanks for the name and email, visible send pins, and you can send pins and people directly to landing pages, Mailerlite and Convertkit, even have a built-In landing page templates now. But the key part of this is no matter how you get your landing pages, whether you're using your own email service or whatever, that, you know, these are going to be very distraction free.

[00:26:03.800] - Kim
Like it's very focused on getting that person to take the action without distraction. No ads, none of that. So here's an example of one of the ones that was in Convertkit. OK, so a lot of people say, well, how do I build these landing pages, right? So there's a lot of different ways you can do it.

[00:26:22.600] - Kim
Like I said, you might be a little bit more clunky and harder to work with to get it to be really minimal and without distraction, because you're going to have to you know, you have to go in and make sure that your pop ups are off and things like that. Landing page plugins come like come in different brands like Elementor or beaverbuilder or Thrive and you know, the names of the companies or the products that are out there for plugins that basically just put a pretty landing page kind of over like an overlay is what I think about it, like digitally, like a digital overlay of a page on your website.

[00:26:56.560] - Kim
And so instead of it having the menu and stuff, these plugins are page builders, and you can do some drag and drop. And they also have like premade themes, like where people have made nice looking landing pages and you can basically use those templates and those landing page templates and you can change out the titles and you can change out the fonts and colors in the background, like you can fully customize it. But the templates are nice, because it kind of gives you a framework to start with and then you can put your own things on there.

Email marketing services like Convertkit could also have landing pages. Like I mentioned before, a lot of the shops and schools like thinkific and Teachable and Kajabi and Podia have landing pages now and then there's the external option, which is Leadpages, which typically is a more expensive one. And I've heard of things like Clickfunnels and things like that. So there's just a lot of options out there and it really just depends on your personal goals and your budget.

[00:27:50.560] - Kim
So you'll be wondering what's so special about an impulse sales page, right? So that's what we're talking about today in particular. And honestly, it usually starts with a thank you and expectations set. So you say, hey, thank you so much for subscribing. That's on the way to the inbox for you right now. So that you're you're letting them know like, hey, like what you signed up for is happening right now. And then it makes a very direct quick offer with a significant discount.

[00:28:16.050] - Kim
The offer being whatever the product is that you're giving away at a significant discount and usually has a buy now button and a countdown timer at 10 to 12 minutes, again, it's an impulse offer. It should have a picture and information about you, it can have testimonials and that, you know, that's kind of up to you. Whether or not you've got testimonials yet for your product, it doesn't have to. I think that the picture and information about you in this case is important.

[00:28:39.970] - Kim
And no, it's not a full sales page. Remember, this is an impulse offer. So whereas a full sales page, you're really having to take a cold audience and really warm them up because the price point on the product is higher or something like that, you know, that would that would include like doing a little bit more copywriting, a little bit more compelling copy, you know, testimonials, really communicating what's in it for them, because you are trying to, you know, take, get people take that action and that action is going to require a lot of trust.

[00:29:12.520] - Kim
But in this case, there's an impulse sale which requires some trust, but not the same as what it would be for a full sales page, because this product is a discount. Like it's like just like at the grocery store, those impulse purchases that you make at the candy bars or the magazines, you know, this is you getting that chance. And you may have seen this if you've ever ordered anything from like Vistaprint or something like when you go to check out, there's just a little bit much because they're like offer, offer, offer, offer, get this for discount, you know, get a pen with a logo on it or whatever.

[00:29:38.470] - Kim
Important variable number one about these impulse sales pages is that you do want to create a sense of urgency. You can do this using countdown timers. You know, the sale ends at this date. Last call emails, whatever it may be. So then you got to start thinking about your sales copy. And if you're not really familiar with this or this is something that you're kind of weak in, I highly recommend Kate Doster's programs because she's really good at copywriting.

[00:30:04.660] - Kim
But the number one thing is tell your audience about the problem that you know they have. So you want to identify that and you want to be able to tell them that what you have to offer then solves that problem. And on the sales page, you want to help them understand what life is going to continue to look like.

[00:30:18.130] - Kim
Without that, hopefully you know, it's going to probably suck and then help them understand what life will look like when they do have it. Which is going to be amazing. And then you ask them to buy now and find a way to add urgency and or scarcity. So that's a very simplified version. But this is kind of what we're trying to communicate as quickly as possible on this upsell. I mean, on this upsell or impulse offer page. So step eight is to set up the funnel in your email marketing service.

[00:30:43.870] - Kim
Email marketing post opt in redirects, is kind of where you get this done. And so this is a picture from inside of Convertkit, and if you use Convertkit the key in an email email marketing product is when you're creating your opt in your form, whatever they want to call it in that software is that you need to look for what happens when a visitor subscribes to the page or to the form. And in this case, you need it,  like in this case I've changed it on Convertkit to redirect to an external page.

[00:31:11.110] - Kim
And that's where I'm going to post the url of the sales page that I previously created and published.

[00:31:18.950] - Kim
Then you need to set up an automation usually with this, and so this is inside of Convertkit. So you can see that in this, the first two red squares of the top are my forms. And these are two different forms that I have in my website that both go to the same email sequence.

[00:31:33.530] - Kim
But you want to get these set up and turn that thing on so that when someone opts into your form or onto your page, it triggers for that email sequence to go out on autopilot because this is where we start getting into the passive autopilot income.

[00:31:48.260] - Kim
Step 10 is to wait, watch, document, tweak and test.

[00:31:51.170] - Kim
Which I know is a lot in one step, but it's really about tweaking, testing, tweaking, testing. So the next question people usually ask me is like, how do I know if this is working?

[00:31:59.570] - Kim
And, you know, it's important to know that you're not going to get a sale each time somebody pops in your email list. So if you have this set up to where you have this impulse offer, not every single person who subscribes to your email list is going to take that impulse offer, their just not, because going to depend on variables like copy, it's going to depend on how warm your audience is and if they want that thing.

[00:32:21.500] - Kim
So as a target, the industry kind of standard of percentages is 2.35% or more conversions. And that means it's probably like an effective sales page and you're around the average mark, if you can get five to 10 percent, that's even better. That's really good. That's a good indicator that you've created something that is connecting with your freebie and also connecting with your audience. So I feel like, well, how do I calculate that information?

[00:32:46.730] - Kim
To be able to calculate your conversion rate on pretty much anything that you're testing, is the total action. So what does those actions that you want those people to take? So if it's purchase, that's the action. If it's subscribed, that's the action divided by the total number of people that saw that offer. So you could go into Google Analytics, for example, and look and see how many people were on that landing page versus the number of people who actually purchased.

[00:33:10.880] - Kim
And that starts to give you a conversion rate, information that you can use to make decisions about how well things are going for you and if you need to tweak or make changes.

[00:33:20.160] - Kim
So your challenge after listening to this talk is to set up a strategic freebie, plus a trip wire or impulse offer, there's a different name for these things on your site in the next 12 weeks on your blog. And you may be like 12 weeks! I don't need 12 weeks, but you'll be surprised if you don't already have a product available like you may need to make a product and that can take some time, even if it's a small thing to get all those pieces in place.

[00:33:44.610] - Kim
Because you have to remember, this was a 10 step process where you have to come up with it. You know, you have to make it.

[00:33:44.610] - Kim
You have to connect all the pieces of the payment processor and get all uploaded, get the sales page made, make your welcome series. Like there's a lot of pieces of this puzzle and you'll give yourself time to work on it, whether it's six weeks or 12 weeks and give yourself a little bit of a deadline. You can be making passive income in a very short period of time on total autopilot. So I'd love for you to see if you can create an instant source of new income that was not there before.

[00:34:15.390] - Kim
That happens while you sleep.

[00:34:18.050] - Kim
So if you guys have enjoyed this talk and you know right now, which I'm guessing because this is like a 30 minute presentation, that there was a lot of information that was presented that you may have gotten some ideas or some aha moments.

[00:34:30.110] - Kim
But you know that you probably need to revisit the information when you're sitting down and can really focus and think through these things. I want to give you guys some free cheat sheets for this challenge that I laid out for you. So I made the special pack to help make sure that you can take your knowledge from today's workshop and put it to work. So this is my step by step impulse offer cheatsheets, which you should be able to get in my presentation area, like there's maybe a button or something that has a link to these freebies that are here.

[00:34:58.640] - Kim
Thank you guys so much for your attention and your time. And whatever you do, just keep blogging.
