Hey there, blogging breakthrough people. It's Nadalie Bardo, your Pinterest. coach here. I'm really excited that you joined.

[00:00:20.030] - Nadalie
This is my favorite training ever. It's going to make Pinterest super simple and clear for you. Driving traffic to your blog or your business or your shop will never be easier. So, how about we start the class? This is the crazy simple way to get loads of Pinterest traffic. Ready to stop stressing out about finding more leads for your business. To quit worrying about how to actually get more traffic?

[00:00:51.170] - Nadalie
To create a crazy simple strategy for increasing traffic, subscribers and sales. Well, let's be honest, those are the three things we care about most. If so, let's do it. So, hey, all. I'm Nadalie Bardo.

[00:01:07.360] - Nadalie
I'm here to help you launch and level up your traffic with Pinterest. As a Pinterest coach, I'm dedicated to helping blogs, businesses, and brands just like yours achieve their goals of more traffic, more subscribers, and more sales with Pinterest. So, what if you could 3X your traffic? How about 5X it in just a few months? You can with Pinterest if you know how.

[00:01:35.870] - Nadalie
This is just a snapshot of the potential power of Pinterest. This is the day I started pinning everything changed for me. Maybe you think right now that Pinterest is a social media site. You might not know that Pinterest is a visual search engine and that there are over 5 billion monthly searches on Pinterest and over 400 million active monthly users on Pinterest. But did you know that Pinterest users are more likely to purchase from you than users on other platforms?

[00:02:10.930] - Nadalie
Or that 75% of weekly Pinterest users say they're always shopping? Okay, that's the mindset of Pinterest users and that Pinterest searches are seasonally driven and that the simplest way to get traffic is by making your content timely, or that your success on Pinterest starts before you even create a pin. Did you know that? There are two types of content you can create. On one hand, we've got nevergreen. You've heard of evergreen content?

[00:02:44.240] - Nadalie
To me, it's never green content, doesn't really bring you that much money. That gets a low but steady search volume. So, search volume just refers to the average monthly number of users who are searching for a particular keyword versus steaming hot seasonal content that gets a massive boost in search volume because so many people are searching for these answers at the exact same time. So, let me know, which type of content are you creating for your business or for your blog?

[00:03:15.390] - Nadalie
Nevergreen or seasonal? Have you been making only nevergreen content? Are you missing out on this massive source of monthly traffic? If you're feeling like this right now, don't worry. The solution is simple. You're going to know the season you're in, know what people are interested in and when, and then create it right?

[00:03:40.700] - Nadalie
If we break down any Pinterest strategy, this is the core of it. And you're going to get pinning. So, what does this look like? How do you plan for this? You're going to pin by the seasons of your main audience, which is likely the USA.

[00:03:55.360] - Nadalie
So, for example, I'm based in Canada, but the majority of my audience is from the US. Where is your audience from? You're going to pin based on their seasons. So, we got winter, December to February, spring, March to May, summer, June to August, and autumn or fall, September to November. You know the seasons, right?

[00:04:16.980] - Nadalie
But with one major catch, you're going to start pinning 45 days before. So, if we're talking Thanksgiving, that's October 12. Christmas, November 10, New Year's, November 16. Valentine's Day, January 1st, Easter, February 23rd. So, these are those major US holidays, right?

[00:04:39.530] - Nadalie
You're going to count backwards 45 days, back it up. So, even better, if you can do 60 to 90 days ahead of time, this is going to help you to get more traffic. So, if we're just looking at those holidays, you can see right here, we are just going to back it up 60 or 90 days. So, here's an example. You know we'll take you all the way to the end of the year.

[00:05:04.450] - Nadalie
New Year's Eve is December 31st. So, let's count back 45, 60, and 90 days. So, here's just a calendar. We've got December 31, which is our big day. We'll count backwards 45 days, takes us to November 16th. We'll count back more 60 days, November 1st. And then 90 days brings us to October 2nd. So, here's just a look at a trend graph. In case you've never seen one before, I always say it's your new best friend.

[00:05:36.040] - Nadalie
This trend graph is showing you when particular keyword traffic spikes, right? So, you can access this with a Pinterest business account that's free of charge. You click on analytics and then trends, and this is where it takes you. So right here, this is 45 days out, November 16th We can see if we go over to Google trends, which is the OG trends tool, which is around long before Pinterest trends came about.

[00:06:02.480] - Nadalie
If you can't find information on your keyword in Pinterest trends, I encourage you to check out Google trends because they line up almost perfectly. So, this is the trend that we see in Pinterest. And now I'm going to flip over to Google, and you can see that it pretty much starts taking off on the same day, 45 days out. Okay, right here. So, you might be wondering, why so early?

[00:06:25.560] - Nadalie
Why 45 or more days? Okay, it can take three plus weeks for your pins to be indexed. That means three plus weeks for Pinterest to categorize your pins, and three plus weeks for your Pin to even be found in search. So, let's take a look at that. Let's take a closer look at that New Year's Eve. So, I've laid out all the days for you. We've got the big day, 45 60, 90 days out. Okay? Right here.

[00:06:55.500] - Nadalie
Consider this the time it takes to be indexed. So, what would happen if you waited too late to publish this content? Right? This is our big day. If you waited too late, you would completely miss all the traffic for this holiday.

[00:07:11.680] - Nadalie
That's why we want to get started ideally, 60 to 90 days before, you don't want to miss the traffic. Okay? This is why it's so important to get started early. You get started early to get all the traffic.

[00:07:25.670] - Nadalie
You get the take off, the peak and the fall, as opposed to missing it all. So, quick pop quiz to make sure you've been paying attention. I want you to point to the screen when you should get started with this keyword. Okay? So when would you get started? I'll give you a few more seconds to decide.

[00:07:44.930] - Nadalie
Are you pointing okay. Right here, that's where you should get started. 90 days out, ideally. Okay, remember, time to be indexed. So, you might be wondering, is this just for holidays?

[00:07:56.960] - Nadalie
Like, what if I can't think of holiday content? It's not relevant to my business, right? You got to think trendy instead. Trends come and go. You got to think timely instead.

[00:08:09.300] - Nadalie
All right? So ask yourself questions like, what would my customers be interested in during this month? March, April, May, June, July, August, September? Dive deep into these months. What's going on in their lives?

[00:08:22.930] - Nadalie
What challenges, problems, questions, or concerns would they have in insert season here? Okay. I want you to think about it. Think about what they need. What are the solutions you have? So, when we're thinking trendy and timely content, there's always a best time to promote a certain piece of content.

[00:08:43.180] - Nadalie
And when I use the word content, it could be a blog post, a product, a pin, a podcast episode, a video, whatever it is you're creating. You just have to figure out when that is. That's why these trend graphs are so helpful. So, you can check tools like Pinterest trends, pinterest 100, Pinterest Predicts, Google trends, or your analytics. It's just not your first year of business.

[00:09:08.750] - Nadalie
What were people interested in a year ago? You have the data. Are you using it? Check your Pinterest, check your Google and your Tailwind analytics if you're using it. What were people interested in and when?

[00:09:23.810] - Nadalie
When, you got to figure out this. When is the best time to share this content? And what will Pinners be interested in on X date? Then you can do your research, and you can plan. You can plan ahead.

[00:09:35.080] - Nadalie
You can plan the whole year of content. So, let's go through those steps. Step one, you're going to choose your keyword phrase. So, select a relevant keyword phrase that's three to five words in length and in season in the next 60 to 90 days. We want to go after a phrase because that you can actually rank for and be found in search results.

[00:09:55.550] - Nadalie
For example, if you are just going to search business, it's a keyword, but it's more or less just a word. There's millions of results, but if you're doing how to start a business with no money, that's a phrase you can rank for. So, for example, I'm typing in spring, you can see some things come up in Pinterest trends. Also using the search bar, you'll see my search query results also have some search volumes right beside it. That's because I have the keywords everywhere plugin installed.

[00:10:24.970] - Nadalie
It shows you the search volume for Google in any search bar. So, this also shows up data for like YouTube and on Amazon. So, it's very helpful. Also you can check out Google trends. So, you want to remember, even nevergreen keywords are most likely seasonal.

[00:10:41.380] - Nadalie
You could think, oh no, there's no way this is a seasonal keyword. But you do your research and you realize that almost every keyword has a spike. So, for example, start a business. This peaks in January. There are so many keywords that have peaks where you think, okay, this would be any time of year, this is relevant.

[00:10:59.130] - Nadalie
But you want to time yourself with these waves, so you can get that huge boost, that boost of traffic that trickles into subscribers and sales and ad income and affiliate income and all that good stuff. Okay? It's a seasonal keyword phrase. So, step two, you're going to go create your content. Remember, content refers to anything you're creating, blog posts, products, podcast episode.

[00:11:22.310] - Nadalie
So, you're going to write a blog post, film a YouTube video, record a podcast episode, or create a product page and hit publish. You're going to add your main keyword phrase to your content's, title, link and image. So, we've got right here, ways to find your purpose in life, title, link, and also your image. I also just cut all my feature images and make those as my pin. That's just a way to streamline my image creation.

[00:11:49.750] - Nadalie
I suggest you do something similar. And then remember when we're using these keywords, you can also search and see right down below all the results that come up for these types of keywords. So ,here are just some examples of the type of content that you can be creating. Get creative, right? You can create blog posts, list-type posts, videos. There's so much you can do for any type of keyword.

[00:12:15.590] - Nadalie
So, for example, here are some examples of content that was created for that keyword of business. It can be an image pin, it could be a video pin, right? You can have shorter pins, longer pins. There's so many types of pins you can create. And speaking of pins, you're going to design multiple pins per post or per link.

[00:12:34.800] - Nadalie
So, create three to five pinterest pins with your keyword phrase front and center. Make them different and distinct. So, for example, here's a static pin. You could also create video pins. You can also make idea pins.

[00:12:48.130] - Nadalie
These are the types of pins. They're like carousels. You can click through them. They've got multiple pages. So, these are three styles of pins you can create.

[00:12:57.420] - Nadalie
And here are some other examples, static, video, and then an idea pin. Okay? So don't just create one type or style of Pin. Make sure you're making use of all of the tools that are available to you.

[00:13:09.840] - Nadalie
And this is just another form of pin. So, you might be wondering, it's not a lot of work, Nadalie like I don't know if I want to do all that. But here's a pro tip. Use canva pin templates that convert.

[00:13:20.260] - Nadalie
This is going to save you so much time and make it easier. So, save time by creating and customized pins in an easy to use graphic design tool like canva. Get started for free. You don't need to pay anything, especially if you're creating your own images like photos and videos. You don't need to use their stock library. You can just upload your own images.

[00:13:42.910] - Nadalie
So, don't start from scratch with every pin. Just swap in the new text and update the images anytime you're creating content. So, for example, here are some of Carly's pins. One post, second post, third post. Okay? They're the same templates.

[00:14:00.480] - Nadalie
She just changes the text and updates the images. Here are a few more examples. Right. Kayla over at writing from nowhere. These are her pin templates.

[00:14:09.030] - Nadalie
All she does is update the images and change the text. This is how you save time. So, you have your pins. Now it's time for step four, you're going to save those pins to Pinterest.

[00:14:20.220] - Nadalie
So, you're going to add your pins to Pinterest in real time or schedule them with a tool like Tailwind. So, be sure to SEO your pin titles and descriptions with your chosen keyword phrase. Remember that keyword phrase we found? So you're going to add it to the title, add it to your description, add it to your website link. We did that.

[00:14:39.360] - Nadalie
Add it to your image and to your alt text, which is simply, in case the image doesn't load or they're using a screen reader, you know visually impaired is able to understand what your content is about, and you're going to save that to a relevant board. So, this is a post on meditation. It's saved to a meditation and mindfulness board. We're checking all the boxes, helping Pinterest to understand what our content is about.

[00:15:02.430] - Nadalie
But here's a warning. I encourage you to wait seven days or more to save the same link to Pinterest again. So, yes, we designed multiple pins. But wait a week before you share that same link again. Just allow your pins that space to breathe.

[00:15:17.910] - Nadalie
So, maybe on week one, you put this pin, and then week two, and then week three, we're leading all the way up to spring. Week four, week five. Here are just some pins that I've created for one piece of content over the years. Week seven, here's another. Week eight, every year, I just design new pin templates.

[00:15:36.070] - Nadalie
And then you continue pinning until the big day. That's it. And then you rinse and repeat with every season. So, say you created seasonal content for this year. Next year, update it and keep sharing it with new pins.

[00:15:49.540] - Nadalie
You're going to update posts and build on your content yearly. Create content for the seasons. This is how you're going to grow. Not sure where to start? How about we brainstorm some ideas together?

[00:16:00.980] - Nadalie
So, let's talk about the big ones. The big niches, or as Pinterest calls them, categories of content. So if you're in blog or business, you could do spring cleaning your biz, surviving summer slumps we all know what that is, right?

[00:16:14.980] - Nadalie
Back to school promotions or back to business, right? That's huge in September. Black Friday deals, huge for business. Holiday deals and promotions.

[00:16:24.210] - Nadalie
How to run them, what the best ones are. You do lifestyle and home decor. Spring cleaning and decluttering. Summer parties and barbecues. Back to school is huge.

[00:16:34.800] - Nadalie
Thanksgiving or football, it's a whole subculture. And the holiday season is crazy, right? If you're in food and drink, you can do recipes for birthdays, weddings, or Halloween, kitchen gadgets for holidays. You can do easy recipes or five ingredient recipes, traditional recipes for insert season here.

[00:16:54.760] - Nadalie
Shopping list ideas, nobody wants to think about what they need to buy. Make it easy for them if you're in event planning. Easter traditions, summer dinner party ideas, even barbecues, back to school events, holiday parties, engagement parties ideas. You know engagements are huge in the new year.

[00:17:15.470] - Nadalie
Fashion and beauty. You could do spring, summer, winter or fall trends. You can do prom and graduation, also, really big topic what to wear to holiday. There's a holiday every month.

[00:17:26.430] - Nadalie
Must haves for holiday or events. Once again, there's one every month. You can do hair, nails or makeup tips for insert season here. If you're an art and DIY, you can do make your own festive item.

[00:17:38.520] - Nadalie
For some reason, there's like a wreath for every season. It's so hot. Gardening in the spring, summer arts and crafts, back to school in the fall, thanksgiving projects, right?

[00:17:50.020] - Nadalie
Art and DIY. Finances, spring clean your finances, finances for the new year. All those finances keywords spike in January.

[00:17:58.260] - Nadalie
Saving up for summer vacations, road trips, those types of ideas. Paying for events, weddings, anniversaries, baptisms, whatever. Think about it. Graduation, holiday parties on a budget.

[00:18:10.990] - Nadalie
So, you might be wondering, does seasonal content really make a difference? Like does this work? Can pinterest traffic be that crazy simple? I have receipts, as they say. So here's just a look at multiple events where seasonal traffic has spiked my business.

[00:18:29.040] - Nadalie
Okay, so you can see these big spikes. That's seasonal content. So, you see it over on Pinterest. It ripples to my subscribers. It ripples to my income, right?

[00:18:41.580] - Nadalie
These all line up perfectly. And it goes beyond pinterest traffic. I get a huge spike in Google organic search traffic. These all line up identically. And it's not just for the big day.

[00:18:53.600] - Nadalie
You get a spike in the lead up, the big day and the fall off. And imagine if you had a spike every single month. And here's just another snapshot, some more spikes in my traffic. If you could 3x, 5x or 10x your traffic and your subscribers and your sales along with them.

[00:19:14.190] - Nadalie
Here's just another snapshot of a few months, spikes, spikes, spikes. But before you go, if you got questions about what to do and what not to do on Pinterest, not quite ready to take on Pinterest. Feeling like this? I got you.

[00:19:28.810] - Nadalie
So hold up. Here's a few simple rules to follow, what not to do. Okay? Rule number one, do not repent the same pin. Create a fresh pin, optimize it to the nine, pin it to the best boards, then move on. Go create a new pin.

[00:19:44.130] - Nadalie
Do not repin. Rule two, no need to use group boards. This is no longer a beneficial strategy. Save your time and energy. Focus on your own boards.

[00:19:55.560] - Nadalie
Rule three quit focusing on other people's pins so much. It's all about you, all about your content, your front and center. Rule four, do not skip SEO steps. Okay? SEO is important.

[00:20:09.360] - Nadalie
We started with choosing our keyword. Make sure you check every box and take it all the way to when you hit save or pin on pinterest. Rule five, do not do too much at once. Take it slow, okay? Don't save 100 pins in a day.

[00:20:23.590] - Nadalie
You might set off some spam alerts, and you don't want to make sure that, you know your account doesn't end up in Pinterest's bad graces, okay? So avoid doing that, okay? Feeling a little better. Anything else? Well, I'm glad you asked.

[00:20:39.920] - Nadalie
Here's what to do. Keep things positive is rule number one. Okay? So, negative topics, hateful topics, you know, things like politics do not belong on pinterest. It's not a place to argue.

[00:20:54.570] - Nadalie
It is a place to inspire. Okay? Keep things positive. Two, fresh pIns only, right? We're not repinning. 

[00:21:03.960] - Nadalie
We're creating new pins for our content. So, focus on keeping it fresh. And your freshest piece of pin, your freshest piece of pin, your freshest pin is going to be linking to your freshest content, which just means new content, right? So keep creating new links to be successful on pinterest, you need to have multiple links.

[00:21:25.350] - Nadalie
And rule three, design different pins. Your pin should all not look identical, okay? It can be come across as spammy if every single pin is just slightly different. So, just design different pins. Experiment.

[00:21:39.570] - Nadalie
Rule four, just be consistent. Get started. Keep showing up. Keep going. No taking your foot off the gas.

[00:21:48.040] - Nadalie
And even if that means just pinning one pin a day, start with that, commit to that, and stay consistent with that. Rule five, set realistic expectations for yourself. Okay? Pinterest is a long term strategy. Yes, you can 3X to your traffic with seasonal content.

[00:22:05.260] - Nadalie
It works, okay? But understand that there might be a learning curve, that it might not hit a home run the first time you do it, but you just got to stay consistent with it and just set realistic expectations for yourself and just commit. It's a long-term strategy and see it through. Okay. So, Pinterest, you'll definitely most likely see results in a few months. Things should start head in the positive direction.

[00:22:32.290] - Nadalie
But remember, your success all is determined by the keywords you choose. And just want to make sure you're checking every box for seasonal content. Are you feeling more confident right now? I hope so. I hope that little pep talk has helped you have the courage to get started.

[00:22:48.390] - Nadalie
Are you ready to get started? Here's one more bit of encouragement. Okay, you're feeling ready? Thumbs up. Here's just another snapshot of what happened.
