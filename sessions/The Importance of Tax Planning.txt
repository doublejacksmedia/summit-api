Hello. Hello. Welcome to today's presentation. I'm going to be talking to you guys today about one of my favorite subjects, and that is taxes. And more specifically, how you can pay less money in taxes, which I don't know, I think it's probably everybody's favorite subject at this point.

[00:00:30.810] - Kesha
My name is Kesha Jantae. I am an income tax strategist, and what that means is I help small business women keep more of their hard earned money in their own pockets and out of uncle Sam's hands. And I do that through comprehensive tax plans that are full of tax strategies that are proven to help you save money on taxes. And that's exactly what we're going to be talking about today. We're going to be going over the importance of tax planning, what it is, why you need it and how it can help you save money on taxes.

[00:01:00.400] - Kesha
In case you've never heard of this concept of tax planning, I want to go over exactly what that means first. Simply put, tax planning is strategically making sure that you're paying the least amount of money in taxes possible on the income that you earn throughout the year. And I do want to emphasize that we're talking about legally reducing your tax bill, not making stuff up, but actual legal opportunities that are available to you in the tax code. And the tax code doesn't require anybody to pay more money in taxes than they actually have to.

[00:01:33.660] - Kesha
There's so many opportunities in the code for people to legally reduce their tax bill, but the problem is that the average taxpayer probably has absolutely no idea what's in the tax code, let alone what you know the opportunities are that are available to them.

[00:01:52.410] - Kesha
And when you are filing your tax return and not taking advantage of all the opportunities that are available to you, the government doesn't write you a cheque and send you a love letter at the end of the year saying, hey, you sent us a little bit too much money. Absolutely not. They're going to keep it, and they're not even going to say thank you. Now, there are opportunities in the tax code for all different kinds of taxpayers. Whether you are low income, high net worth, a business owner, a student, a parent, a homeowner, an investor, it doesn't matter.

[00:02:24.430] - Kesha
You are probably going to find something in the tax code that's going to be able to reduce your tax liability. But if I'm being honest, some of the biggest and best opportunities are really reserved for business owners and as bloggers and YouTubers and Instagrammers and influencers and content creators in general, a lot of you are actually running a business. Some of you may already know that because you've been in the game quite a while, but some of you might be fairly new enough that you don't feel right calling yourself a small business owner just yet, even though you actually are.

[00:02:58.250] - Kesha
And even if you don't think you are, I can tell you one person that definitely thinks you are, and that's everybody's favorite uncle, uncle Sam. And if we know one thing about uncle Sam, we know uncle Sam wants his cut.

[00:03:12.340] - Kesha
And when it comes to small business owners and taxes, small business owners are usually paying a huge chunk of their profits in taxes. We know that bigger companies typically pay a much smaller percentage of their profits and income tax. We hear about it every year. And actually, within the next couple of weeks, we'll probably start seeing some headlines about it as these companies start releasing their financials from their year end. And reporters start digging through the financials so that they can scoop something.

[00:03:43.000] - Kesha
We'll start seeing headlines like company A made billion dollars worth of profits and pay no income tax. Right. We hear every year. We see it every year. We talk about it every year.

[00:03:56.610] - Kesha
But that lets me know that there is a disconnect between the small business owners such as you and me and the big business owners because as a business owner, you have access to the same strategy that the big guys use. And I'm not saying that Amazon's tax strategies are going to necessarily all work for you, but some of them might. And of course, if they do work for you, they might be on a smaller scale. But at the end of the day, you still have access to those strategies.

[00:04:28.830] - Kesha
Now, there are a couple of reasons why you, as a small business owner, are paying proportionately more money in income taxes on your profits than a bigger company would be.

[00:04:39.790] - Kesha
But what it all boils down to is that one of you doesn't have a plan, and it's not the multi billion dollar company, right. And I'm more specifically talking about a tax plan. Now, some people may have never heard of the concept of a tax plan. So, yes, these are real things that actually exist. And a tax plan is a set of strategies that is going to help you strategically reduce your tax liability so that you can meet the goals in your business.

[00:05:09.610] - Kesha
And frankly, in your life now, most people that are going into business, regardless of the industry, are doing so because they have an ultimate goal of generating some kind of income. And I will say that's from personal experience, I don't know anybody personally that went into business, so they can lose money. I didn't. None of my friends did. Nobody that I know went into business specifically to lose money.

[00:05:32.330] - Kesha
So, I think it's safe to say that most, if not, all of the people that go into business, they do so because they're trying to generate some kind of cash flow. They're trying to generate an income. Now the why they're trying to generate income, this person to person. You might want to put your kids through college, you might want to buy a house, you might want to pay off your debt.

[00:05:54.610] - Kesha
You might want to travel the world. You might want to retire your husband or retire your parents or get back to your community. Whatever it is that you're trying to do, you know that's your why. But at the end of the day, the whole purpose of starting this business is so that you can generate money so that you can fulfill your why. So, doesn't it suck that when you do all of this hard work to generate this income, you got to give most of it over to the IRS at the end of the day. In business and really in life, there are two ways that you can increase your cash flow.

[00:06:27.450] - Kesha
The first one is to make more money, grow your revenue, increase your income if you will. And there's so many ways that you can do that. You can sell ad space on your blog. You can do more sponsored posts. You can charge more for the sponsored posts that you are doing.

[00:06:42.410] - Kesha
You can do both of those things, right? You could sell more products through affiliate links. You can create your own products on courses, your own membership programs. You can do so many things, even down to just being more visible so that you can increase your audience and your following so that you can command higher prices with those products that you're trying to sell on the back end. And you should definitely be doing all of those things, regardless of what I'm going to say next.

[00:07:09.300] - Kesha
You should absolutely be increasing your following, increasing your audience, doing some kind of ad or promo or sponsored post or something like that. You should absolutely be doing that. But a couple of things you have to think about when you are trying to increase your cash flow through just making more money is that one, it's not guaranteed. You're not guaranteed to get a sponsorship deal.

[00:07:34.970] - Kesha
You're not guaranteed to actually make money through affiliate links. People might see your content, or they might even click on the link that they might not necessarily buy. So that's one thing you have to think about is it's not guaranteed. So, you're going to be putting a lot of work upfront into trying to increase your income, and it's not always going to be a guaranteed payoff. And the second thing is that it might take some time for it to happen.

[00:08:01.960] - Kesha
So, yeah, while you're focusing on increasing your following on social media or increasing your list for your blog or increasing your page views, those numbers are not automatically going to turn into revenue. So, you might actually spend some time doing all of those things and then the payoff happens later. So, there's something to think about with increasing your income or increasing your cash flow by making more money. The second way to increase your cash flow is to spend less money. So, the first one was to make more money.

[00:08:36.470] - Kesha
The second one is to spend less money. You can do this by renegotiating the cost that you have to pay out to run your business. So, maybe instead of having a photographer take your photos every week, you may cut that down to every other week or once a month, and you learn how to take your own photos. Maybe you can cut back on the events that you attend. Maybe you can lay off some of your staff if you have people on your team, you know there's so many things you can do or you can look into tax planning.

[00:09:12.310] - Kesha
Tax expense is one of the biggest annual expenses that small businesses have. Remember, small businesses like mine and yours, on average, are spending a bigger percentage of our profits and income tax expense than some of our huge corporation counterparts. So, when it comes to increasing your cash flow, tax planning helps you spend less money because tax planning helps you reduce your tax burden. And that is by spending your money strategically. So, you don't necessarily have to go super lean.

[00:09:45.520] - Kesha
You just have to put your money in the right spot. So, you might not necessarily have to cut your photographer back from every week to once a quarter. Maybe you can do every other week or every month as long as you have some other things in place, like tax planning that's going to help you reduce your overall expenses so that you can increase your cash flow. Okay, so now that we've talked about what tax planning is and why it's important, tell me if this sounds familiar to you, let me know if this is you.

[00:10:15.710] - Kesha
So, right now we are in tax season. Tax season runs from the beginning of January to the middle of April, and in a normal year when we don't have all of that going on outside, tax day is around the 15th of April.

[00:10:30.230] - Kesha
Okay, so tell me if this is you. So, January comes and goes. February comes and goes. Now we're in March, and you haven't even considered pulling your paperwork together to give to your tax professionals so that they can get started on your tax return. And then April 1st gets here and you're all of a sudden starting to grab all of your paperwork and all of your documents, whatever you can to drop off to your tax professional or to upload to their portal because you got an email that told you that they need this information by a certain date.

[00:11:05.730] - Kesha
If you wanted your tax return to be filed on time. And then on April 15, they give you a call or they send you an email and they say you owe X amount of dollars. Or they might say this is whatever your refund is going to be. And now you're grumbling because even though you weren't really sure what was going on with your financial information or your financial situation because you didn't really keep up with your numbers throughout the year. I'm talking to you and you. You just knew that you weren't going to have to pay any money, or you knew that your refund was going to be higher than what it is.

[00:11:41.260] - Kesha
And not even that.

[00:11:42.410] - Kesha
You just knew it like it's not even that you just knew it. You already spent the money. So, then you ask that question that every tax professional loves to hear on April 15 or whatever the deadline day is leaning. Or you get real serious on the phone and you say, okay, so what can I do to lower that number? And that's if you owe, obviously, or if you're getting a refund, you might say, So how can we make that number higher? It's like music to my ears.

[00:12:17.440] - Kesha
I love getting that on deadline day from a customer, from a client. The truth of the matter is, if you're waiting for a tax to find tax savings, you are entirely too late. Because other than a handful of tax revisions and possibly being a little bit more organized that you can find more deductions, the things that you would have needed to do in order to save money on your 2021 tax return would have needed to be implemented in 2021. There's very little that you can do once the clock strikes twelve on New Year's Day.

[00:12:53.910] - Kesha
That's going to move the needle on your tax return. For the most part, you can only correctly record what you've done already, so we can make sure that you've captured all of your deductions.

[00:13:04.190] - Kesha
But we can't switch income from taxable to non taxable. For example, proper tax planning strategies need to be implemented early for you to get the biggest benefit from them. So, right now in January is the perfect time to start thinking about how you're going to reduce your tax liability for 2022. Right? January 2022.

[00:13:27.180] - Kesha
We're going to see what we need to do for the rest of the year. So that when January of 2023 comes, we have done what we need to do to reduce our tax liability. And not only do these strategies need to be implemented early, they need to be reviewed regularly to make sure that the strategies that you have implemented are still in line with your goals and your business. So, here's the thing. Here's the issue that causes many small businesses to overpay in tax year over year.

[00:13:57.880] - Kesha
I call it the reactive tax mindset. So, this is how the reactive tax mindset works. You make money, that's step one. You made $100, right? You had an ad, you did a sponsored post, and I know some of you all are like grumbling when I say $100 for a sponsor post, but if, for example, purposes, so, just roll with me.

[00:14:18.300] - Kesha
Okay, so you sold a sponsor post. You sold an ad, you've done product through an affiliate link or something. You've made $100. Okay. And as soon as you get that $100, you automatically set aside 30% for taxes.

[00:14:32.740] - Kesha
Some of you are, some of you are not. Some of you all are still kind of winging it. But for this purposes, we're going to say that you set aside that 30%. So, you set aside $30 for taxes. Now you might actually be paying that money in estimated taxes every quarter, or you might just be setting aside in a bank account.

[00:14:51.400] - Kesha
You might just be putting it under your mattress. At the end of the day, you set aside $30 for taxes from that $100. So now you have $70 left and you're able to use it to reinvest into the business, or you might just take it out of the business and pay yourself with it. And then when tax time comes around, you do your tax return and maybe your actual taxes that you owed on that $100 is less. And so, you're able to get some of that money back, and you're excited because you got money back.

[00:15:18.780] - Kesha
You set aside this amount of money, you didn't have to actually pay that much. So, now you can go on vacation or you can pad your savings account, or you can do whatever you want us to do with that money. Does that sound like you? It sounds like a lot of my clients, right? It sounds like a lot of people that I know. The problem is when we're in the reactive tax mindset, we may set aside some money, but we don't really spend the rest of the money in a strategic way that's going to help us reduce our tax liability even further.

[00:15:46.810] - Kesha
We kind of just want to make sure we set aside enough money so that we don't have to give the IRS even more money in April. And that's the extent of our concern with taxes until April comes around, and we see our tax bill. There is a solution to the reactive tax mindset, and it's what I call the Proactive tax strategy. And this is how the Proactive tax strategy works.

[00:16:09.450] - Kesha
Step one is still earning $100. So, you still did whatever work you did to make that $100. This time instead of paying taxes, first, you have a plan. So, you strategically put that money in its designated place. And of course, I do not mean that you're going to physically take a dollar and physically put it somewhere.

[00:16:27.560] - Kesha
But you have a plan that you're going to stick to, and that plan is going to tell you how to spend the money so that it reduces your taxable income and your tax liability. And I want to emphasize that we're doing this strategically, which means I'm not telling you to go run out and buy something that you don't need just so you can reduce your tax liability. And I know you all have seen it. I know you all have seen people get to the end of December and start asking, what are you spending your money on?

[00:16:53.940] - Kesha
Because I need to reduce my income.

[00:16:55.720] - Kesha
But I'm not paying all these taxes I'm going to buy it, too, even though they don't need it. That is not what tax planning is all about. Tax planning is about spending your money strategically. So, I'm sure that some of you are starting to do some head math and thinking this seems a little expensive. I don't know if I'm going to be able to afford to pay somebody to do this for me.

[00:17:17.540] - Kesha
And to that I say you know you're going to spend the money anyway. Remember, the tax plan is designed to help you reduce your tax liability. So, if you're sticking to the plan, then the tax savings will justify the cost of the plan itself. Now, some of you are probably thinking, hey, I have a tax lady. I have a tax guy.

[00:17:36.410] - Kesha
I have a tax person, and she or they are amazing at what  they do. And if there was any opportunities out there available for them, for me, then they would have definitely caught them by now, and we would absolutely be taking advantage of them. And that might be the case in some instances, but in my experience, it's not the case across the board. And that is for a couple of different reasons. So, first of all, most taxpayers only see their tax professional once a year.

[00:18:03.710] - Kesha
And as we talked about earlier, that's usually at the last minute in a rush, trying to beat the deadline. And if you're only seeing your tax professional once a year, nine times out of ten, they probably don't have the time or the information needed for your business in order to be able to provide you with a you know personalized tax plan that's really going to provide you with strategies that you could use to reduce your tax liability. Sure, they might be able to give you some blank strategies, like put money into a retirement account.

[00:18:32.690] - Kesha
Maybe consider doing this, maybe consider doing that, but they don't have the time to go through all the projections that's really needed and the research that's really needed to see what qualify or what you qualify for in your business. And those basic tax strategies are, you know they're great.

[00:18:50.200] 
I'm not knocking them at all. They definitely have value, and they would absolutely be included in a comprehensive tax plan if they make sense for the business. But in order to get the biggest bang for your buck, in order to get the best benefit out of having a tax plan, you really have to dig deep into the details of the business and just knowing that you have a business and what you sell in your business, whether it be you know I'm a mommy blogger and I do affiliate links or I'm a mommy blogger, and I do sponsor post like, that's not really enough information for a tax professional like me to be able to give you a comprehensive tax plan.

[00:19:28.840] - Kesha
I need to know way more details about your business than just what kind of business you have.

[00:19:34.540] - Kesha
So, that brings me to my second point, which is there's so much more information and more detail that goes into building a comprehensive tax plan than what your regular tax professional might have. They'll know whether you're married, they'll know what your spouse does for a living, or at least they you know who your spouse's employer is. They'll know if you have kids, they'll know how old those kids are. They'll know if you're a homeowner, if you're an investor, they'll know all of those things. But we take all of that stuff when we're doing tax planning and we dig deeper, we get deep, right.

[00:20:06.320] - Kesha
It's not just are you married and does your spouse have a job? Now we start thinking about, okay, you're married. Your spouse has a job. But how could we turn some of this income that you're earning that's taxable to you and you know hire your spouse in some capacity in your business to actually do work? Remember, we're talking about legal stuff here.

[00:20:28.410] - Kesha
So how can we hire them to actually do some work in your business and pay them in a non taxable manner so that you're still earning the same amount of money. You're still paying the same bills that you would normally pay. But now we turn some of that income from taxable to non taxable, same with your kids. What kind of interest and what kind of skills do they have that we could use in our business and make them employees and actually have them do some work and shift some income from our much higher tax bracket down to their much lower tax bracket.

[00:20:59.020] - Kesha
So, you know, when you have kids, you're paying for the basic parental stuff, but then you also pay for all that extra stuff on top of it.

[00:21:05.100] - Kesha
Right? You have to close them. You have to feed them. You have to show to them. But you're also buying them a car, possibly paying for the gas for that car, paying for the insurance for that car, buying them Iphones, Ipads and Apple watches or whatever the Android version of those things are.

[00:21:21.610] - Kesha
You are paying for PlayStation and Xboxes and you know makeup and all kinds of extra stuff for your children. So you're spending all this extra money and you're usually not able to get a tax deduction for it. But if your child has those skills or those interests that you might be able to use in your business and you bring them on as employees and you pay them as employees, and maybe now they can take the salary that they're making. And they can buy that stuff themselves, same money that you would have been spending anyway.

[00:21:51.270] - Kesha
But now they're paying for it out of their own money, and you get a deduction for on your tax return. So, in addition to getting information about your family, we'd also get more information about you know your plans for the future, your goals and again, not just in your business, but also in your life, something that you might not even think would apply to your business.

[00:22:10.940] - Kesha
To be able to reduce your tax liability might actually have some opportunities. So we could be having a conversation. And I could you know just ask, hey, what are your plans for the future? It could be anything. It doesn't have to be specifically related to business.

[00:22:23.850] - Kesha
And you can go, hey, I'm thinking about buying a house out in California that we could use as a vacation home once a year. I just really liked the area, and you know I want to have something that we can call ours out there. Now, in your head, that's not at all related to your business. So, in my head, I might say, let's see how we can take this second home that is not related to your business and see how we could generate some additional tax deductions for the business, not generate any additional taxable income, and thereby reduce your tax liability.

[00:22:58.290] - Kesha
And again, this is completely legal if you qualify for something that's called the Augusta Rule, which basically means that you can rent your home out up to 14 days throughout the tax year and not pay any income tax on the proceeds or rental income.

[00:23:14.070] - Kesha
So, you might be thinking, but, okay, how can I use that to reduce my business income? Well, your business can rent out your home, your second home for up to 14 days during the year. You can do it for business meetings, client retreats, whatever you know whatever you want to use it for specifically for your business. And on the personal side, you don't have to recognize income. But on the business side, you can take a deduction for it.

[00:23:38.820] - Kesha
So, you're literally not actually spending any money like it's not leaving your house, but you're paying less tax on that deduction. So that is not for everybody. So, don't go out and say, Well, Kesha said I could do this. You really need to talk to somebody to make sure that that works for you. But that's just an example of what could be.

[00:23:55.800] - Kesha
So, if you're still not convinced, I want to share a couple of examples that I have seen help people save a lot of money on their taxes. Now, keep in mind that these are examples. Numbers vary, situations vary, outcomes vary, but at the very least, you'll be able to see how tax strategies can actually, you know help somebody reduce their taxable income. So one of the first things that probably every tax planner goes over with potential clients, new clients, recurring clients is business entity optimization. And basically, we're going to look at what your business entity is, whether you are a sole proprietor, a partnership, and S Corporation or C Corporation or taxed as one of those because you might be an LLC.

[00:24:38.680] - Kesha
But LLC don't exist for tax purposes. LLC are taxed as one of those other four. So, we're going to look at how your business is taxed. And we're going to see if you might benefit from being a different type of business entity, your business entity really determines how much money you're going to pay in taxes on your profits. So, if you're a sole proprietor, all of your business profits are going to be added to your regular income, and you're going to pay regular income tax plus self employment tax, which is 15.3% on that income.

[00:25:10.180] - Kesha
And that's even if you don't take any money out of the business, whatever your profits are, at the end of the day, you're going to pay income tax and self employment tax. And depending on how much other income you have, your federal tax rate can be pretty high. So that's sole proprietor, the other one is partnership, and partnership is basically tax the same as sole proprietor. It's just that you have more than one owner, so the pockets are going to be split, and that's a general. There's so many different kinds of partnerships.

[00:25:37.600] - Kesha
I'm specifically talking about a general partnership, which is kind of the default type of partnership. It's taxed in the same way as a sole proprietor. But you're only taxed on your portion of the profits instead of all the profits. S corporations are taxed a little bit differently. They do flow through to your personal return.

[00:25:55.590] - Kesha
But you're only paying income tax on the actual profits of the business. And with C corporations, the company itself pays taxes at a flat tax rate, which is currently 21%. And then if you take any money out of the business, then you're going to pay whatever your regular dividend income tax rate is. So, again, whatever business entity you have is going to determine how much tax you have to pay. So, a sole proprietor that nets $100,000 in their business, is going to be paying a different amount of tax than somebody who owns an S Corporation or C Corporation that nets the same amount of money.

[00:26:28.720] - Kesha
So, you'll come to us, we'll look at your business entity. We'll run some numbers and we will determine you know whether the entity that you have now is right or whether you should switch to something else. So, let's walk through an example of how business entity optimization can actually save you money on your tax return. So, for this example, we have a blogger who's pretty popular because she is a single millennial living in a big city, and her whole platform is about millennial dating in a big city. So, she talks about her first dates, her last dates and everything in between.

[00:27:00.800] - Kesha
She started this back in 2020. She didn't have any other income in 2020, so she really wanted to get into the blogging space. So, she worked really hard. She was really focused and she grew her following and she was able to get sponsorship and sell some ads on her blog, do some affiliate marketing. And after all of that, because she was so focused, she was able to generate a net profit after all of her expenses of $80,000 in profit because that's a really easy number for me to be able to do this calculation for this example.

[00:27:32.010] - Kesha
Now what she didn't do was set up her business formally because she just got into it in 2020. So, she didn't really want to do anything permanent. She just wanted to kind of see how it went. So, she was out here operating as a sole proprietorship. Now as a single person with no kids, generating $80,000 from a sole proprietorship, she had to pay $18,000 in income tax on that income in 2020.

[00:27:58.880] - Kesha
So, after she wrote that check to the IRS, she swore that she was going to talk to a tax professional to see what she needed to do so that she can reduce her tax liability for 2021 because she did not want to pay that kind of money to the IRS again. So, then she booked a consultation with a tax strategist much like myself, and they sat down, got all her information, asked her some questions about you know where she plans to go in the business, where income expectations are for the year, and took them back to the bat cave, punched some numbers, did some research, and found out that it really would be best for her if she was to change her business from in sole proprietorship over to an S Corporation and pay herself a reasonable salary so that she could really maximize her tax savings.

[00:28:41.730] - Kesha
So that's exactly what she did. She set herself up as an S Corporation for 2021. She paid herself a salary, which was about $30,000 because that's what this tax strategist told her would help really maximize her tax savings.

[00:28:53.910] - Kesha
And she continues to work hard and focus in 2021. And she did roughly the same kind of business that she did in 2020. So, this year, instead of her profit being $80,000 from her business, she's going to pay herself a salary of $30,000, and then her profit is going to be about $48,000. The difference, you know it doesn't equal up to $80,000 anymore because she's paying herself as an employee, she does have to pay payroll taxes. That's an additional deduction.

[00:29:21.520] - Kesha
But making that change with her business from a sole proprietorship over to an S Corporation and pay herself a salary, she's able to reduce her tax liability from $18,000 all the way down to $10,000. So, she's able to save really about $6,000 when you take into account the extra payroll tax that she has to pay. But that's still a decent amount of tax savings just for changing your business from a sole proprietorship to an S Corporation. So, for the second example, we're going to stick with our millennial dating blogger friend and just take it a step further.

[00:29:54.680] - Kesha
So, back when she met with her tax strategies, they not only told her to switch her business over to an S Corporation, they also told her to consider putting money into a retirement account because not only is she saving for retirement.

[00:30:08.120] - Kesha
She's also able to get a deduction for the money that she contributes to her retirement account. So, she does exactly that. Remember, she's already set up her business as an S Corporation. So, now she's going to work with the proper people to set up a 401K for herself and make contributions. So she decides that she wants to do the maximum elective deferral, which is $19,500 in 2021, and that is going to come out of the $30,000 of wages that she paid herself.

[00:30:34.780] - Kesha
So, at the end of the day when she filed her tax return, she's going to show the $48,000 of profit from her business, but she's only going to show $10,500 worth of wages from her business in a W two, that's going to drop her tax liability down to $5,797. That's another almost $4,300 drop just from putting money into a retirement account. So, you would just for the $2,000 that she has to pay in payroll tax because she had to set herself up as an employee. She's saving about $10,000 in taxes just from switching her business from a sole proprietorship to an S Corporation and then putting money into a retirement account.

[00:31:17.410] - Kesha
And because she's the employee and the employer, she can actually put a little bit more money into her retirement account by matching as the employer, she can match her employee contribution.

[00:31:27.830] - Kesha
So, for this last example, we're going to stick with our single millennial dating blogger friend and take it even a step further back. When she met with her income tax strategy, she mentioned that one of her family members passed and left her with a house and it's in like a neighboring town. So, it's not too far. But she really likes the hustle and bustle of the big city, and the house is like a small town, so she doesn't want to move out there. But she also doesn't want to sell it.

[00:31:53.100] - Kesha
I'm not really sure if she wants to be rental thing like a long term rental. She doesn't really want to be a landlord, and she doesn't really want to deal with the headache of Airbnb right now. So, she's not really sure what she wants to do with the house. So, at this point, it's just sitting empty and she's not really sure where it's going to go next. So that's when the Strategist told her about the Augusta rule, and we talked about that a little bit earlier.

[00:32:15.640] - Kesha
So, what she could do is rent her house out to her business for business related purpose. Like, I mean, I don't know, a photoshoot, a networking event, a meet and greet, something related to do with her blog. And she could pay herself from her business to rent the house out. And the money that she paying to herself from her business is a tax deduction on her business side. But because she's not going over the 14 days, she does not have to pick up that income on her personal side.

[00:32:46.560] - Kesha
So, in this particular instance, the house is in an area that rents for, let's say $300 a night. It's like a really niche, super nice area, very touristy. People love to come and hang out and do all these things. So, she's renting it out for $300 a night. Again, obviously, these are just examples.

[00:33:03.050] - Kesha
So, things will change depending on where you are. But she can rent the house out for $300 a night to a you know  third party. So, she decides to have a photo shoot there once a month. So that's twelve and then maybe one time in the spring and then one time again in the fall. She has some kind of networking event.

[00:33:26.380] - Kesha
So that's 14 days that she is using the house for her business and she's renting it out to her business for $300 per night during that time frame. So that's a $4,200 of income that she's moving from her business over to her personal side, and she doesn't have to pay tax on it. But she's getting that $4,200 deduction on her business. Having that extra deduction is going to reduce her tax liability by another almost $1,000. So, it brings her tax liability down to about $4,800.

[00:33:59.560] - Kesha
So, remember, she started at $18,000 in taxes that she had to pay for 2020 because she had $80,000 worth of income on a sole proprietorship. So she switched that business over to an S Corporation. She paid herself a salary. She put money into her retirement account and she rented out this extra house that she just happens to have to herself and is able to meet the Augusta rule. And that dropped her tax liability from $18,000 in 2020 down to about $4,900 in 2021.

[00:34:29.780] - Kesha
And she made the same money. She still made $80,000 in profit. But she moved that $80,000 in a way so that it maximized her tax saving. So, she didn't need to run out at the end of the year and buy a whole bunch of stuff that she didn't actually need. All she had to do was stick to her plan.

[00:34:46.880] - Kesha
And the best thing about it is that as long as the tax laws don't change too drastically, she's going to be able to see these tax savings year over year over year. Now, I made up our single millennial dating blogger friend, so any resemblance to a real person is seriously just a coincidence. But that doesn't mean that these strategies are not out there for you. Your situation is going to be different. Your circumstances are different.

[00:35:11.920] - Kesha
So, the strategies that you employ might be different. But the point is that there are strategies out there for you to be able to maximize your tax savings and stop paying the IRS more money than you have to. Earlier in the presentation, I mentioned that when people go into business, ultimately, it's because they're trying to make some kind of money. But the reason that they're wanting to make money varies from person to person. So, personally, for me, I'm trying to be somebody's rich Auntie that's always on a plane somewhere, traveling to exotic land, buying a whole bunch of gifts and bringing them back to my nephews and you know supporting my community and giving back to charity and doing all those things.

[00:35:49.950] - Kesha
But ultimately, I want to be somebody's rich Auntie, that's number one. Okay, but yours may be different from that. It probably is different from that. So, what I want you to do, if you feel so inclined to share is go to the comments and type in your ultimate Why?

[00:36:04.520] - Kesha
When it boils down to it, what is it that you want to be able to do? Why are you doing this logging thing as a business in the first place? And then once you have that written down or thought of in your head, if you don't want to share, I want you to think about our single millennial dating blogging friend who, by making a couple of tweaks in her business, was able to save $10,000 a year in her business. And I want you to think about what an additional $10,000 a year can do for you.

[00:36:39.510] - Kesha
Notice I didn't say for your business, but what can it do for you?

[00:36:43.920] - Kesha
