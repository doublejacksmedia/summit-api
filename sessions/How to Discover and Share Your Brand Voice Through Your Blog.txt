Hey, friends, and welcome to today's presentation all about how to discover and share your brand voice through your blog. I am super excited to jump into today's topic. It's some of my favorite things to talk about when it comes to branding and your brand voice, and specifically how you can share that with your audience, so that you can make deeper connections. Before we dive into the actual body of this presentation, I would love to meet you in the chat. So, as we get started, if you would introduce yourself, tell me your favorite food and the name of your blog in the chat as we kind of dive in.

[00:00:46.800] - Madison
So, as a quick introduction to who I am and kind of why I have this passion for knowing your brand voice. My name is Madison Weatherill. I am the CEO and founder of Grace and Vine Studios. And over there, we specialize in building custom brands and websites for bloggers who are looking to take their business to the next level and who are looking to increase their impact through their blogging experience and through the connections that they make with their audience. I am also a food blogger.

[00:01:13.900] - Madison
I have been doing both web design and food blogging for the last seven years or so. And I'm also a home school mama to a thre. I have three boys, seven four and a half, and a three month old baby. And then I live in Arizona where I cannot get enough sunshine and outdoor time. So that's just a little bit about me, so that you kind of know who I am and why this is an important topic to me.

[00:01:36.370] - Madison
This is something that I work with my clients constantly, or work with my clients on this constantly. And since 2015, when I kind of took this business as my full-time career, I've worked with hundreds of bloggers and been able to really help them to define their brand and define their brand voice. So, defining your brand can help you to do quite a few things and it's a really important foundational piece to your blogging experience and specifically to your blogging success. So, one of the things that defining your brand can do is it can help you to plan your content easier because you are not just trying to figure out what to post, you know, in terms, like there's thousands of things that you could talk about and could write articles on or write blog posts on. And so, when you know your brand, you know your brand voice and you know specifically who you're speaking to, it really helps to narrow down that focus and helps you to more easily plan your content.

[00:02:32.060] - Madison
It also helps you to rank more consistently on Google when Google understands what your blog is all about, and it's not just a hodgepodge of all kinds of different topics. It helps you to make deeper connections with your audience and to really serve them well. And finally, it helps you to have a clearer direction for the trajectory in general of your blog through strategic goal setting. Those are just a few of the things that having a really defined brand can really help to streamline in terms of, you know, what it will do for you in your blogging. So, in the comments, I would love for you guys to post an emoji.

[00:03:09.730] - Madison
Whatever your favorite emoji is, if that's something that you feel like you want for your blog, if you would like to have more clear direction, deeper connections with your audience, and of course, ranking higher on Google and seeing more traffic come to your website. I would love to see what emojis you guys are putting in the chat, because I'm sure that we can all agree that's something that we want for our blogging journey. So, when you think about branding, or when anyone thinks about branding, there are really two sides to branding that you have to consider. Now, the visual side of branding is what most people think of when they think of branding, which is things like your fonts, your colors, and even your logo itself. But there's also the other side of branding, which is the strategic side of your brand.

[00:03:54.880] - Madison
And this is the side that I really love to focus on with my clients and that I love to help other bloggers to figure out. So, the strategic side is the things about your brand, like your niche, your ideal audience, and specifically what their pain points are, and then finally your brand voice. Now, a lot of people try to approach that visual side of their branding first before they consider the strategy side. And often that strategy side comes painstakingly later in their blogging journey as they start to figure things out and kind of learn the hard way. Now, one of the things that makes Grace and Vine Studios unique is our approach to strategy and how we really tackle that first.

[00:04:35.720] - Madison
So, today, you're going to get a little taste of what that is like to really approach things from a strategic perspective first. And we're going to chat about one of the biggest parts of your branding on that strategy side, which is your brand voice. So, what is brand voice and why does it matter for this journey? Brand voice is really the language that you use regularly to describe your content or describe your blog. It could be the way that you specifically describe food or talk about food if you're a recipe blogger.

[00:05:09.100] - Madison
It could be the way that you approach a craft or DIY project, or it could be the types of specific travel content that you share. It really doesn't matter what niche you are in, you have a brand voice and it's really important for you to hone in on that, so that your readers can understand what your blog is all about. Now, in our fast-paced world where we are constantly being bombarded with information, we have started to believe that as bloggers and content creators, that our brand voice isn't important and that our readers don't really care about it, but that simply is not true. Our readers are moving at a very fast pace and often they may miss our brand voice if we are not clear and intentional about it and if we don't repeat it often enough.

[00:05:54.240] - Madison
But our brand voice really does matter and our readers will be interested when they realize that it is something that helps them in the long run. So, really, it comes down to making sure that we're approaching brand voice from the right perspective. When we think about our reader first and how our brand and our blog specifically can guide them through the struggle that they are having, we can tap into the really powerful side of brand voice where it is no longer about you as the content creator, but it's about your readers and how they see themselves in your brand. I'm going to repeat that because it's something that is really important to shift your perspective on when you think about brand voice. When we think about our reader first, we are able to sort of step aside and let the struggle that our reader has be the focus of our content.

[00:06:44.870] - Madison
That is going to help us to tap into brand voice and help our readers to see themselves in our brand, which is ultimately what's going to make them care about what we are talking about. Even if you are in a super crowded niche like food blogging, there is space for your brand voice. Even if you're monetized with ads, or you're trying to rank higher on Google, or even if you are sort of an anonymous blogger and you don't really have sort of that personal side of your brand, your brand voice is really important. There is a space for all of these tactics for focusing on SEO and monetization and even not being the face and the front and center person in your brand. There's still a place for your brand voice because it helps you to differentiate what is unique about your blog specifically.

[00:07:38.610] - Madison
So, when it comes to your brand voice, to recap a couple of things, your brand voice distinguishes you from other bloggers who talk about the same type of content, or the other bloggers in your niche. It helps your readers to understand what your blog is about, even if they're moving super fast and they're being bombarded with lots of information, and it helps your biggest fans or even your family to understand what you do and to share about your brand for you. This is really key when we start to create a brand that is recognizable by other people and they can share it for us. Every single blog and every single one of you here, regardless of the size of your blog, can benefit from tapping into your brand voice and sharing it with your readers.

[00:08:22.580] - Madison
It's not enough for us to just know our brand voice, we also have to get comfortable with sharing it with our readers. And we're going to talk about that here in a few minutes. So, the first part of this process of figuring out what your brand voice is and sharing it is that you have to start by understanding your audience. In the chat, I would love to hear how many of you feel like you know who your audience is. Give me a number between one and four to tell me how much you feel like you know your audience.

[00:08:51.550] - Madison
One being no clue who your audience is, and four being you feel like you know them, like they're your best friend. So, something to understand about knowing your audience and understanding who they are is that it's not just about knowing demographic information. Demographic information like their gender or their age or their occupation, those things are really helpful for visualizing your audience and having a person in your head as you are writing your content. But when I'm talking about understanding your audience, I am saying that this is something that happens when you really understand them on a deeper level than just gender, and age, and occupation.

[00:09:30.470] - Madison
You want to understand things like what are their fears? What desires do they have for their life? How do they spend their time? What do they wish they had more time for? These types of facts about your audience are things that tap into the emotional side of their lives and these are the things that are going to help you to make those deeper connections and again, get your audience to care about what you are talking about.

[00:09:56.030] - Madison
So, how do we find out this information? This seems like a gold mine of information, but how do we know this stuff about our audience? Well, the easiest way to figure this out is to ask them and to talk to them about it. I didn't mention this in my introduction, I forgot to say this, but I have a podcast where I talk about all of these types of strategy, tips and tricks for bloggers, specifically. And the podcast is called The Vine Podcast.

[00:10:23.020] - Madison
But I have an entire episode about out the tools that you can use to get to know your audience. And I'm going to put the link in the chat for you guys. Just go ahead and open this in a new tab and you can listen to it later if you're interested in getting to know your audience on this deeper level. But just to go over a couple of the tools that are really helpful for unlocking this information. The first is using something like social media and the tools that we already have built into social media.

[00:10:47.150] - Madison
I'm going to talk about Instagram specifically, but a lot of these could also apply to another platform if your audience is really active on another platform. Instagram stories is a great way for you to be able to make these connections and ask questions to your audience. You can do things but like just sharing behind the scenes, stories or information in your Instagram stories about the specific struggles that you think your audience may have and seeing what type of feedback and engagement you get from that content. You can also use things like Instagram polls, or a questions box to get your readers to engage and to ask them questions. My advice for you on this is don't make this a super open-ended or really deep philosophical type of question unless your audience is really engaged already.

[00:11:35.860] - Madison
You want to start with small things here, and you may even have to just get your audience to engage with you on social media first before you start digging into their questions more specifically to get to know them. So, maybe you just post some funny polls or some questions about what things are on your dinner menu this week, things that are going to be really easy for them to answer before you get into some of these deeper questions. Another way that you can tap into this information is through your email marketing. Now, whether you have five people on your email list or 5000 people on your email list, this is something that you can utilize. And it's as simple as just putting a question at the bottom of the emails that you're already sending to your email list and just asking them, hey, what are you struggling with with X?

[00:12:20.240] - Madison
It could be, what are you struggling with with planning your meals for this week? What are you struggling with with eating healthy? What are you struggling with when it comes to creating DIY projects? Whatever it is that is your topic that you focus on, ask them specifically what their struggle is and let them share with you as candidly as they want to. Finally, you can focus on having real life conversations with people.

[00:12:43.890] - Madison
You can use Instagram or Facebook or email marketing for those conversations, but you can also talk to people in your real life who feel like they fit the mold of your ideal reader. So, if you have a neighbor or a cousin or a friend who you feel like struggles with the same things your audience struggles with, take them out to coffee and ask them a few questions about your content to see how you can better serve people who are like that particular person that you are interviewing. Once you understand what your audience is struggling with, then you can figure out how your brand provides a solution for that struggle. This is not often something that is different from what you're already doing. All you're figuring out is the language around how they describe their struggle and how your brand can provide that solution.

[00:13:30.130] - Madison
So, it isn't necessarily that you're going to have to do a 180 and pivot your content completely, you might just find new words to describe the struggles that they're having with getting dinner on the table, making DIY projects on a budget, traveling on a budget, whatever it is that your content is. You might just find different language that your readers are already using to describe the things that you're creating for them already.

[00:13:54.570] - Madison
So, in the chat, I would love to hear some of the struggles that you guys think your audience has and that you help your audience to overcome. This may not be something you know 100% for certain, but this is going to help everybody else start to think about what they might be helping their readers with. And I would love to see the different things that you feel like you're helping your readers struggle with. So, here are some other key parts of your brand voice that you can figure out. And to better help you define this brand voice, I have created a free download to help guide you through this entire process.

[00:14:29.720] - Madison
So, to really dig into a lot of the things that we're covering at a really high level right now. This free download is going to help you to dig deeper and answer these questions, and you can download it with the button below, or you can go to my website, graceandvinestudios.com/voice, where you can download it there. But some of those other key parts of your brand voice are things like what is your story? Most importantly, why is this struggle that your audience has relevant and important to you? If it's something that your audience struggles with, chances are maybe you've struggled with it in the past too, and you have overcome it.

[00:15:04.040] - Madison
Or maybe you are just one step further on that journey to overcoming it than your audience is. Whatever it is, there's something about this that is important for your readers and important to you, and you want to make that connection with them on that personal level. What are some ways that you solve problems for your readers? Maybe it is the specific content that you share, maybe it is another resource that you share through your website, or through a podcast, or something like that.

[00:15:30.480] - Madison
What are the specific ways that you're going to help your readers with this problem? Thinking about what your niche is now, it's really important to go a few layers deep. When it comes to your niche. Your niche is not just travel or food or lifestyle or DIY. I always tell our clients that when you think about your niche, you want to go three layers deep.

[00:15:50.730] - Madison
So, the ones I just mentioned travel, food, lifestyle, or DIY, that's the top level, what specific type of content within that niche do you share? Do you share a specific type of travel content, a specific type of recipes? That's your second layer. Your third layer is if I were to line up all of your competitors side by side, everybody that's in that sub niche of healthy recipes or travel, you know, budget travel.

[00:16:16.440] - Madison
If I lined all of you guys up, what would make you different? That is your niche, and that's what you want to focus on figuring out when it comes to your brand voice. And then lastly, kind of touched on this just now, but how does your brand different from others in your niche? Maybe what values do you have that make you different? What other types of content that you share that might be different?

[00:16:37.900] - Madison
There's something unique about you and your brand and why you are the person to help your reader, and that's what you really need to hone in on when it comes to your brand voice. Now, something to understand about your brand voice is that you have to share it and share it often. The more you share this and the more you talk about the unique parts of your brand, the more your ideal readers are going to connect with you and your brand. I always describe this as, you know, everybody who's coming to your blog. If you have specifically a lot of traffic from Google or even Pinterest, even social media, if you have a lot of people that are coming to your blog, you're going to have a bigger circle of sort of everybody who comes to your blog.

[00:17:17.940] - Madison
And then within that circle is this smaller, intimate circle of your ideal readers. Those are the people that you are going to help the most through your content, and those are the people that you want to attract to your blog the most. Your brand is not supposed to be for everyone, and it's really hard to come to terms with that. But if you want to truly help your audience in their struggles, you have to be okay with repelling some people from your brand. For example, if you're a DIY blogger who's focused on projects using a cricut machine, you don't need people coming to your site who don't have a cricut machine or who aren't interested in that type of content.

[00:17:54.470] - Madison
If you are a full sugar, full butter, kind of dessert blogger, you don't want people looking for whole 30 recipes coming to your website. It isn't a match. And so, think about it in that way when you know, you know that specific struggle your audience has, the people who don't have that struggle, or who on the opposite side of the spectrum, you don't need them coming to your blog because you are not the person to help them. There's another blog out there who can help them. So, really quickly, let's talk about five places where you can share this brand voice once you have really unlocked what that brand voice is for your blog, specifically.

[00:18:31.730] - Madison
I have a lot of podcast episodes that talk about each of these pages and each of these places more specifically. So, again, if you're interested in hearing more about this, I would really encourage you to check out the podcast where I can go a little bit deeper than what we're going to cover today. But the first is your homepage. So, as a blogger, your homepage is a really, really important hub for people who are discovering your brand and who are trying to figure out what your brand is all about. Your home page is often the second place that somebody comes to when they come to your blog.

[00:19:00.370] - Madison
They're going to start on a blog post specifically, and if they land on your homepage, it's because they are curious. So, your homepage is really like the gold standard of a place for you to utilize that brand voice and connect with your ideal reader. On your home page, you can look for places like your about section where you can really talk about you as the blogger, your reader, and who you can help and really put that into a really nice about section. It's also in the different types of content and categories that you display on your home page that at a glance, someone can start to understand what your blog is all about and also having a really strategic and aligned freebie that is aligned with that brand voice. And that struggle for your audience is going to be a great way to help people understand.

[00:19:46.410] - Madison
The second place that you can focus on is your about page. Now, this page is often really misunderstood as a spot to kind of put a biography of yourself, but your about page is really a place where your brand voice can shine. This page should be more about your ideal reader and their struggle and how you can help them than it is a biography for you as a blogger. This about page should really help your reader to understand your brand and how they fit into it. Now, in your actual blog post and like the content that you are writing, you have so many opportunities to be able to use this brand voice strategically.

[00:20:24.910] - Madison
This isn't a place for you to just go on and on about, you know, the history behind the recipe or why your grandmother made it or anything like that, which I know there have been so many different memes about food bloggers talking like that in the past. But this is really a place where you can shine as the expert and shine as somebody who is helping your reader with their struggle. Share helpful tips that really align with that struggle and helping your readers with. A couple of examples of this might be a section of your blog post that talks about how to make this recipe a balanced meal, how to make this project on a budget, or how to save on travel costs. For each of you who is watching this presentation, these sections should look different because your brand is different.

[00:21:08.620] - Madison
This is not a place where you should just copy and paste a section from another blog because your blog is unique and you have a unique way that you can help your readers in their struggle. Another way that you might incorporate this into your content is by sharing the why behind the project or the recipe or the article. But again, you want to align this with the struggle that your reader has to help them be excited about this content. This isn't supposed to be just a random story that you share. You can also share this type of information on social media. So, regularly relate to your audience and their struggles by showing up on your social media platform of choice and showing behind the scenes or extra tips or real life examples of how your expertise helps you to overcome the same struggles that they are having.

[00:21:58.070] - Madison
You can also focus on this in your email marketing, which we touched on a little bit earlier. Similarly to the different examples I've already shared, your email marketing is a place where you really can make those connections and share your brand voice. People on your email list are already excited about what you have to offer because they're on your email list and they've already sort of raised their hand that they want to be a part of your brand. So, this is your chance to solidify that messaging and the connection that you have with them.

[00:22:27.310] - Madison
So, as we wrap up, I want to cover a couple of action steps for you guys as we wrap up. I really want to make sure that you guys download the freebies, so that you can focus on solidifying your brand voice. In this presentation, I really covered why your brand voice is really important in a few of the high level ways that you can start discovering that. But this freebie is really going to go deeper than I can go in this presentation time. So, I really, really want you guys to go, either click the button below this video or go to graceanvinestudios.com/voice, I'll put that in the chat as well to get that freebie.

[00:22:59.990] - Madison
And then carve out some time in the next couple of days or weeks where you can really focus and dig deep on this information. I would love to answer any questions that you guys have about brand voice or where to use it on your blogs in the chat or in the Facebook group after this presentation. And then finally, if you enjoyed this conversation and you would like to learn more about discovering your brand voice and really stepping up to support your audience and their struggles, then again, I would encourage you to check out my podcast, the vine podcast, wherever you listen to podcasts.

[00:23:31.910] - Madison
Or you can also go and connect with me over on Instagram at Grace and vine. And then finally, if you are a blogger who is looking to take your blog to the next level in this new year and you would like a strategic partner in figuring that out, I would love to chat with you and see if it would be a good fit to work together on your branding or your website design.
