[00:00:13.490] - Interviewer
All right, guys. I'm super excited about our next speaker. She has used her blog to pay off and get out of $238,000 worth of debt, which is just mind-blowing to me. I need to do that, I have a lot of student loans. And she has been consistently earning over $20,000 a month while blogging at the Flooring Girl for nearly three years now. So please welcome Debbie Gartner. Debbie, thank you so much for being here. Welcome.

[00:00:36.590] - Debbie
Oh, thank you. My pleasure. I'm finally getting to do something here and meeting you. So it's my honor. Thank you.

[00:00:43.430] - Interviewer
I know I'm so excited. Like we were saying before we hit record, like we've been circling each other for years. So I'm so thrilled that you're part of this podcast this year.

[00:00:50.870] - Debbie
Thank you. 

[00:00:52.190] - Interviewer
All right. So we are going to be talking about Amazon affiliate marketing, which is a bit of a bear because there's so many rules to it and they'll kick you out and all this stuff. So let's start with just when should people be starting on Amazon? And if they've already maybe started, how can they make sure they get those required sales and not get kicked out?

[00:01:13.130] - Debbie
Sure. Okay, so in my opinion, people should really start joining Amazon, the program after they've done maybe about ten articles or so. You see everything, as you know, with blogging takes a while, a while to get traffic and traction. But usually by the time you've written ten articles, even if they think, you can get there because you already have a teensy bit of traffic, but it will give you enough time to get those three sales in six months or 180 days. So that's what Amazon recommends. And that's what I recommend.

[00:01:49.310] - Debbie
Now, can you apply before? Absolutely. I have seen them accept people even before they started their blog. But as soon as you start, your  timeline starts and there are plenty of people, as I'm sure you know, they say I'm going to start a blog and they do something and then they don't really start, they get tripped up on what's my blog name, the design, all the stuff that... I mean, the blog name matters, but the design really does not matter much at all. But people can spend a month on that, which is waste of time.

[00:02:22.490] - Debbie
You got to get in there and get going. So after ten articles, you should be able to, in my opinion, you should be able to easily make three sales within that time period within the six months from that point in time. 

[00:02:40.190] - Interviewer
Okay, so if those ten articles, for example, and obviously you're going to keep writing, how many are sort of focused on, would you go back and have them focus on sharing Amazon links?

[00:02:49.430] - Debbie
Oh, good question. I guess I would say whenever it's relevant. So when I first started my blog, so I started back in 2010. But this blog on 2011. I didn't know anything about Monetizing at all. I'm glad. So, I had all these articles that were not written for Amazon, not written for Monetizing. I used to have a shop-at-home  flooring business, and I wanted people for that. So all my articles were created with that objective in mind. Just help people who are looking for flooring nearby ideally. Educate them on what they needed to know enough so that they would call me.

[00:03:35.290] - Debbie
But then that was irrelevant to monetizing years later. So I went back and I actually went and edited many of my articles and put links in there when they made sense. And that is the whole key. We are blogging... How do I say this? It's not exactly... The customer doesn't care about us. They're not here to help us make money. We are here to help them with whatever it is. And if we can make money in the process because we've helped them, we've given them the right answer.

[00:04:08.410] - Debbie
Then by default, we end up making some money. So later what I ended up doing once I learned stuff is I would do articles that were more intentional with better buyer intent so that they could buy something. So everything is going to start with your target customer and your niche. So I write about flooring and painting, and I'm not going to write about I don't know what's the best bike to buy is. It's completely irrelevant or whatever else. You have to do what's relevant to you. So I would then write articles about flooring.

[00:04:45.670] - Debbie
And by the way, people don't generally buy that much flooring online. So it was another problem that I had. But when people would buy flooring or get their floors finished , they need to know how to clean and maintain their floors, right? They think about all the steps, like right before purchase or right after a purchase, what they're going to need. And then you write articles about that. Generally just putting in affiliate links or affiliate ads of any sort, whether it's an Amazon or somewhere else.

[00:05:20.350] - Debbie
It won't work. People are there to read the article, not to read the ads. And so if I just plug in some of those things, like, I forget what they call them widgets or whatever the heck. They're like, oh, do this for bounty, it's generally not relevant. Or if I put something on there about web hosting, which, of course, is completely unrelated to my blog, my home décor customers won't even know what hosting is, let alone need it. They'll be like, why are you talking to me about religion or whatever? They won't to understand it.

[00:05:56.470] - Debbie
So it's wasted space. Everything has to be relevant to them. So I'd say if you already wrote articles where it makes sense to put them in, not as an ad but within the text of what you have already written, then go for it and do it. Then going forward, try to be more intentional with the articles that you write. So you think about buyer intent or something that they are about to go and do if that makes any sense, solving a problem. So all my blog posts originally were, what's a problem that my customers actually have.

[00:06:36.130] - Debbie
And I had the benefit of actually meeting with thousands of customers in their home. So I get the same question over and over again. So for me, it would be like dark versus light hardwood flooring. What's better? Why, what cost less? All those things? Those are all individual questions in there. And then if I had that article, then I might go back and be like, okay, well, dark floors are a little bit harder to maintain, right? So what can I do to make them easier to maintain. So clean every so often.

[00:07:10.030] - Debbie
Use this cleaner. Use spell pads, whatever. That's kind of my approach on everything. 

[00:07:17.770] - Interviewer
Okay, so one question I have because Amazon is infamous in that you can't do any link cloaking, and there's specific rules about where you can put your links. So how do you kind of manage all your various Amazon affiliate links? I know there are different tools out there, but some really aren't ideal for Amazon. So how do you go about doing that? Because you can end up with hundreds, if not thousands of Amazon links because Amazon has everything. How do you sort of manage and keep that organized.

[00:07:47.050] - Debbie
Right, right. Good question. So they do have a lot of rules. And my simple answer to the rules is read the rules five times, like three is not enough. Read them, any questions you have, ask. You can always get with them on chat. Just make sure you're not breaking any of the rules. Link cloaking is not allowed, to using things like Pretty links or other things. Anything that camouflages the link is not allowed. So I just never use those. And really you don't need to because a regular person on your site is just going to see the words that are highlighted and click on the anchor text of the link there.

[00:08:22.750] - Debbie
So it's not a big deal. But the other part of the question which I think you may be getting at is how do I actually track where my sales are coming from? So, I can take that learning to improve because that is so important. I mean, with everything that we're doing, it's so important to track and improve. Just like we look at Google Analytics, we want to know which articles are doing better. So in Amazon, they have tracking IDs, and you can use those. It's free.

[00:08:50.710] - Debbie
It doesn't cost anything. And that really is the best place to use tracking IDs so that you can learn. Now you can go crazy over these links or you can take a more simple approach, which is what I do because I don't really care usually. Each specific link on the page I want to know which are the pages that are doing well because they always say with market, don't just do it for the sake of doing it, but do it for the sake of an action that you will take or decision you will make, right?

[00:09:23.650] - Debbie
So the way I do it is I have generally a different tracking ID for each article that I write, and I just make it an obvious one, so I won't forget it. So if I wrote about dark versus light hardwood flooring, I would use a tracking idea like dark versus light. Just very obvious. And then I would do that. I would use every link in that post to use that same tracking ID. That tracks within Amazon, so now every time I go into Amazon to look at how well I'm doing, I look at it and sort it by tracking ID from highest to lowest.

[00:10:06.910] - Debbie
So I know everything. Like how much money I made, which you won't find with any external program, which is the most important thing. How much money, how many clicks I am getting. What's my conversion rate, what's working. So, I generally do that. Then when I try some new things, which I do from time to time, I may use a different tracking ID and make it similar. So I know it's from the same post, but I did a word that will be obvious to me. That's what I do.

[00:10:37.150] - Debbie
And then I can track everything and see, okay, did that idea work? Because if that idea worked, then I will write another post and use that same approach. But use the original tracking ID. There used to be a limit where you can only do 100 tracking IDs, but they changed that several years ago. So you can use as many as you want, but don't use too many or you will confuse yourself, and then it doesn't become actionable. 

[00:11:07.330] - Interviewer
All right, can I share my screen? And can you walk me through creating a tracking ID? Because I'm looking, I'm like, oh, yeah. I can select a tracking ID, but I have no idea how to create one. I clearly don't make much of Amazon personally. But I can give it a try.

[00:11:20.170] - Debbie
Sure. Okay.

[00:11:20.830] - Interviewer
Let me share my screen. Can you see my screen?

[00:11:24.910] - Debbie
Yeah.

[00:11:27.010] - Interviewer
So I see now when I go here, I can try...

[00:11:29.650] - Debbie
Yeah, that's it. So on my screen, it's on the right side. But anyway, where you just were, go there.

[00:11:39.890] - Interviewer
Oh, to here?

[00:11:39.940] - Debbie
And tracking ID. And so... oh wait.

[00:11:44.310] - Interviewer
To create a tracking ID.

[00:11:45.570] - Debbie
To create one.

[00:11:46.410] - Debbie
It's by your email address. Yeah. So it is on the upper right. So your email address is like a little downward arrow. So now you can just create one for your page and there's like a super little glitch, which I'll show you in a second. You have to ignore it. But create the tracking ID. It'll be Dash-20 no matter what, because we're in the US. It's different by country.  Create. And it says congratulations, which is good. Sometimes it will say, sorry that one is already taken and it will give you three choices.

[00:12:25.930] - Debbie
And usually for me, the first choice is exactly what I just Typed in. So I don't know why it has that glitch, so you just have to ignore it. But now you have it. And now if you were to go into Amazon, it should be there in the menu. Although it is possible you need to do another page.

[00:12:44.350] - Interviewer
Like a little refresh.

[00:12:46.150] - Debbie
Yeah, you probably need to do that, but it would just be there.

[00:12:54.050] - Interviewer
Check that out, guys.

[00:12:55.610] - Debbie
Yeah, that's all you do. Oh, by the way, I don't do the short links that are there. So I changed it to be a full length, and there's a few reasons for that. One of them is because sometimes the short lengths, there's a glitch and it doesn't always work, and I want to make as much money as possible. Secondly, it's way easier when you have it this way because the link is... Or sorry, the tracking ID is in there. And so let's say I wanted to change it, or let's say I have a section where I have the same thing I use over and over.

[00:13:31.310] - Debbie
Like, these products might be good. If you have hardwood floors, let's say I have four links in there, then I can go and I can copy that into my next article. And then I can just do a search and replace on Microsoft Word and then have it changed to whatever the tracking ID is for that post.

[00:13:50.210] - Interviewer
Well, I've just learned something new.

[00:13:53.750] - Debbie
By the way, if you ever sell a blog to, this is very helpful because you can change all the tracking IDs, even if you forgot. I mean, I have an Amazon course where I show a little hack for that if you forgot to do it. So someone can go and do it in, I don't know, 30 seconds or so for each page. So when I bought a blog, I had someone do that for me and she's like, wow, I didn't realize that was available.

[00:14:18.830] - Interviewer
Yeah, genius.

[00:14:19.550] - Debbie
Definitely helps.

[00:14:19.790] - Interviewer
I like it.

[00:14:21.170] - Debbie
Good.

[00:14:21.950] - Interviewer
I'll stop sharing my screen so we can get back to it.

[00:14:25.190] - Interviewer
All right, so using the tracking IDs to kind of actually see what pages are performing and how they're performing. I have a lot of work to do to. Now go back and edit things. Thank you. So, how do you kind of make sure you're getting consistent commissions? Because, yes, you want your minimum three to keep your account active. But is there something you do to make sure that you're getting consistent commissions?

[00:14:50.910] - Debbie
So usually things are pretty consistent for me because one of the keys to doing well on affiliate marketing and Amazon in particular, is doing well on SEO. And I've always done SEO. So I learned that, like, 2010 to 2012. So because the traffic is generally consistent, my commissions are consistent as well. Now, that doesn't mean 100%. So for me, I do like home décor, right. So home décor is pretty steady, like taking the whole pandemic, putting that aside. But generally throughout the year, it's pretty consistent from January until the weekend before Thanksgiving, and then everything kind of drops because people are worried about the holidays.

[00:15:39.870] - Debbie
They get a Christmas tree. They're not going to do more home décor. They're certainly not going to do flooring work once that tree is in there, right. So it goes down every year that time until December 26. So, I was looking forward to the day after from an income perspective, the day after Christmas because everything goes back up and then life is back to normal. It goes down for another couple of days around the first or the 31st, and then goes back up. Because the traffic is consistent, so are the Commission. Now, I do have some seasonal items, so I have a few that I've written a few years ago on Christmas, and they obviously do not do that well during most of the year. Although I start seeing sales generally a little bit in July and August, but those will really go up all of November and December, even past the 25th, because people go back for their after Christmas sales and get good prices. So that's usually good then. And I have a few other items that may peak a little bit in the spring, and it all depends on what it is that you write about.

[00:16:53.550] - Debbie
But I always look at those things as supplements, so that will keep building over time. But for most of my stuff, I try to do evergreen content, so it's usually pretty consistent. 

[00:17:06.630] - Interviewer
All right, so we have a couple of follow up questions to that. First, if you ever do a post that isn't going to have an Amazon link, I mean, they'll probably have a different affiliate link, but just out of curiosity.

[00:17:16.530] - Debbie
So Amazon is only one of my affiliates. They're the first one that I did really well with, and I often or usually make $4,000 to $5,000 a month on that. But everything is more starts with what's good for the customer. And then if Amazon is appropriate, I use Amazon. But I also do really well with Reward Style, which is another program which I really love, because once you're in that, you have access to all the programs. Amazon is great because there's so much stuff on Amazon, right.

[00:17:54.150] - Debbie
And people buy from Amazon all the time. If they buy one item, but if they have ten others in their cart, I can also earn money on that as well. But Reward Style is also great, because when I'm in there, I have access to all the programs. So it works really well. But it all is what is relevant. So if you're asking, do I write articles without affiliate links at all? Yeah, I probably have a few, but that all depends on your strategy. So my approach is, I'd rather do articles that can at least have some affiliate stuff in there, even if the main focus is somewhere else.

[00:18:36.810] - Debbie
But I like to get kind of a two for one because traffic is good. It's not the beyond the end all, it's like step one, right? It's only step one. There's so much more you need to do after. You can actually earn a lot more on affiliate marketing than you can on ads. And you can do products too. So I try to do more that will help me there now that I've been doing this for a while. So I only earn about $5,000-$6,000 a month on ads.

[00:19:10.350] - Debbie
But on affiliate marketing, I earn more like $18,000 a month on average. So I try to do stuff that will get me primarily affiliate stuff and secondarily ads. I don't flutter those posts with ads.

[00:19:30.150] - Interviewer
All right I mean, kind of guesstimating here. What would you say? What percentage of your posts have an Amazon affiliate link in them, like 80% 90%?

[00:19:40.580] - Debbie
I don't know. Probably, I would guess maybe 80% to 90%, but most of my money is only coming from, I don't know. Let's call it 20 articles or something like that. 

[00:19:58.470] - Interviewer
Sure, sure. I think some people maybe only have Amazon links in, like 5% of their posts, and then they're wondering whether not making more. So just kind of want to kind of point that out that it could... Obviously, the more you put out there, the more likely you'll get a click.

[00:20:13.410] - Debbie
Right, if you're asking me how many articles have any affiliate link.

[00:20:17.550] - Interviewer
Oh, I would hope that's closer to 100.

[00:20:20.310] - Debbie
Yeah, I would guess maybe 95%. i may not be correct, but it's directionally correct. Sure.

[00:20:29.610] - Interviewer
My other question is because you've mentioned SEO. So a lot of people forget that affiliate marketing, there's a marketing piece to it. It sounds like you're primarily doing SEO, but do you ever do kind of additional marketing for your affiliate marketing? And how do you go about using SEO for marketing?

[00:20:48.690] - Speaker 2
Right, so I grew up on SEO. Pinterest came much later, second to me, I just consider that supplemental and SEO traffic is much more reliable. So basically, with affiliate marketing in general, there are three main or the three, in my opinion, best ways to earn affiliate commissions. They are one, SEO because people are searching with intent to either buy or figure out something, so they're much more likely to buy. The second one is email. Now, email won't really work for Amazon because you're not allowed to use Amazon links in there.

[00:21:26.850] - Debbie
But in general, it can work, especially when you have a loyal audience as well as when your list grows. But just having a large list is pointless. But anyway, that can really work and can eventually become your number one source. I mean, it may take you a while to get there, but it can. And then the third one is video. So video, especially YouTube, will act like a search engine so it can be the same thing. People can actually search on YouTube or they can search on Google or wherever.

[00:22:00.330] - Debbie
And often those videos will come up. So those would be the three areas I'd focus on. When it comes to Amazon, I'd really only focus on number one and number three, but I know those can work wonders for your business. So definitely think about that. I do very well on affiliate marketing, and from my email list, I probably make a good... Let me think for a second. So I know I make more than $10,000 a month from my email list, but I don't know the exact breakout of my products versus affiliate commissions, but I would venture to guess that at this point now, I probably make more on affiliate commissions than I do on my own products, but they both do really well that way.

[00:22:48.030] - Interviewer
So let's talk about really quickly. You mentioned SEO because there's an intent there. What kind of intent? I mean, you want them to be in the space to buy, not just trying to figure out what's out there. How do you kind of figure that out? Is there an SEO tool you use or just a strategy in general?

[00:23:07.710] - Debbie
Yeah. so I just use the strategy in general. And I will also say people won't want to hear this, but sometimes I just use my gut to do it because I've been in this business for a long time, so I know what my customers ask for, because some of the SEO tools will not give you all the right information. And I go more for a long tail search. But if I had to choose a place, like the best place is probably [unclear], depending on how you prefer to say it.

[00:23:41.730] - Debbie
So I go after very long tail stuff and or what seems to be most relevant to my particular audience. So, I use a method where I just look at the ones that have the lowest competition and which I think will lead to good sales. So you can follow different formulas. And I have some of this in my Amazon course too. But like the best X for Y. So I just go back to bikes because I randomly talked about that before, but I wouldn't just say the best bikes, right?

[00:24:16.950] - Debbie
Like that's too broad and vague. And who's even going to search for that? But I might say, like, what are the best bikes for young kids or little girls? Like the more specific I can get or for mountain bike riding, whatever. But be specific. So not just one of the best bikes, but what are the best X for Y? Another method I use is alternatives for things. So you could take a big brand that's well known that people might search for in that category. And like I'm looking at my refrigerator now.

[00:24:55.530] - Debbie
So like, what's a big brand for refrigerators that might be expensive. You get the idea. 

[00:25:01.530] - Interviewer
You'd be like, Whirlpool alternatives that are the best or something.

[00:25:05.130] - Debbie
Right, so you might say alternatives to Whirlpool or Whirlpool hot tub. I mean, whatever it is that you're writing about, that's the idea. So take something that people want, but a whole bunch of them may not be able to afford, and you're going to give them alternatives that will get them their desired benefit, but at a price point, that may make sense for them, because lots of people will price shop and they want a good value. Most people don't want cheap, they want a good value. So they want something that is good, doesn't suck but for less money. Is that make sense?

[00:25:41.130] - Interviewer
It's not about the lowest cost. I miss the best value for the lowest cost.

[00:25:44.310] - Debbie
Exactly, exactly

[00:25:47.770] - Interviewer
And then I just want to say we did touch on that. Like Amazon isn't the only affiliate marketing in town.

[00:25:53.470] - Interviewer
Diversify as you said, as you may have seen on my screen, Amazon is nowhere near my business. If amazon isn't fit for your audience, don't stress it.

[00:26:08.990] - Debbie
That's right. Amazon is not right for everybody at all, and every niche is not. If physical products are right for your audience or right for that blog post, then Amazon is probably a good bet because their conversion rate is so much higher than other equivalent retailers. So most retail products believe it or not, have a 1% conversion, which sounds like it sucks, but it is a fact of life. So you need to remember that. This is why you need lots of volume, okay? About 1% versus Amazon when you're doing well, not stellar, but when you're doing well on Amazon, you should be able to get 8% to 10% conversion. I personally usually get 10% to 12%, but 8% to 10% is a good place to shoot for. But if you just do the math, even though Amazon Commission may appear to be lower than some places, and by the way, often they're not when you do apples to apples comparison. Because if you look at this on Walmart or versus whatever, they're usually not that different when you do that. But anyway, pretend that they were, right? You would need the other place to be paying you eight times as much commission just to be equal with Amazon.

[00:27:27.110] - Debbie
Amazon converts well, because people trust Amazon, they can get other stuff on Amazon. Most people have a credit card already stored on Amazon. They make it easy to buy. Yeah, they're good at upsells. I mean, so many reasons. So when people say get off Amazon because of low commissions, that to me is not valid. If they say, go to other places in addition to Amazon. Yes. Or if Amazon or retail products are not relevant to you, your blog or your audience, yes. Don't feel like you have to do Amazon, like diversify.

[00:28:04.430] - Debbie
So I would guess that Amazon at this point is probably like 20% to 25% of my affiliates, and affiliates are one of my largest contribution right now. They're not even all that I make. I generally make, you know, I don't know, $25,000 to $30,000 in profit. Obviously, my revenue is higher because I have costs in there, but I always measure things on profit, and that's only part of it. So it's a percent of a percent. You need to think about this, like the stock market. Like I'm not just going to buy GE or whatever.

[00:28:42.950] - Debbie
I'm going to have a variety of stocks because some will go up, some will go down. I'm going to then get mutual funds or index funds. And then I'm also going to have difference in asset allocation. It's like bonds versus mutual funds or stocks or versus real estate. And what's your situation? How old are you? How long until? 

[00:29:04.250] - Interviewer
Yeah, what's your risk tolerance?

[00:29:06.350] - Debbie
Exactly.

[00:29:07.430] - Interviewer
Okay, so we're running out of time. I know you have a free guide for everyone. You want to tell them about that?

[00:29:15.890] - Debbie
Oh, yeah. So I have a guide for Amazon specifically. Although some of the tips will actually apply to all networks, so just bear that in mind because I do well in affiliate marketing in general. But it's seven tips to improve your Amazon commissions, and I'm giving that away for free. So you guys can have that. And I hope it's helpful.
