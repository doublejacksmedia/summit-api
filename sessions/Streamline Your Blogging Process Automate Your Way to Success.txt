Hello, hello, and welcome to the next presentation in the Blogger Breakthrough Summit. I am going to be specifically talking about automations for blogging today. That is the more technical aspect of trying to take some of the repetitiveness out of the blogging process so that you can end up putting out more content and focusing on creating quality stuff, instead of having to repetitively copy and paste things from one place to another. So yeah, this is probably going to be a more technical presentation, but don't worry, I'm going to take you through it step by step, but please don't zone out before we've even started.

[00:00:57.810] - Jessica
Right, first things first, I want to introduce myself. I'm Jess. I mostly work with business owners that are stuck in the messy middle of growing their business. I do that by solving their tech challenges, their systems challenges, so that they can stop putting out dumpster fires every single day and instead focus on bringing their ideas for their business to life. I call myself mostly a tech and systems implementer because that's what I do. I go and build things for people so that just stuff runs smoothly. However, whenever I'm working with people in the very long term, I have a lot of conversations with them around things like content, marketing, advertising, funnels. So yeah, it's not limited only to your tech setup. I've been doing this since 2016, which now seems a very long time ago. In that time, I've probably built out hundreds of different funnels, courses, membership sites, checkouts, email automations, project management setups, and whatnot. That's been most of what I've been doing.

[00:02:03.750] - Jessica
And then most recently I was fractional CTO and CMO for a seven-figure coaching business. So they had about 15 team members, and I've mostly been focused on the digital product funnels. So working with the copywriter and the designer to optimize and run split tests on all of the different funnels. So that's what I've recently spent my time doing. Right now you may end up seeing yourself as a blogger. However, I see you as an entrepreneur that's ready to make things happen. And that's how I'm going to be speaking to you today because I want you to put your, "I'm running a business" hat on instead of just thinking about, oh yeah, I can do this little blog thing on the side, because it takes way more than that.

[00:02:54.410] - Jessica
On a personal note, I suspect that I am an ADHD human. I have no way of verifying that where I currently live, but it is what it is. I grew up in Germany, lived in the UK for 11 years, and I've been in Albania for the last four years. I am mostly fueled by coffee. I've got my trusty coffee with me right now. When I'm not working, I'm currently nerding out a little bit on learning Python for data science because I'm interested in the whole AI thing, but I don't have the tech foundation to explore this more, so that's why I'm doing a lot of courses on the side at the moment. Overall, I love tech, I love systems, I love automation, and I love data so that we can make better business decisions, and that is how my brain works.

[00:03:48.760] - Jessica
What are we going to be covering today? I want to talk about systems and automation for blogging. The thing that I want to make really, really clear is that I am 100% tool-agnostic in my work. It's not that people haven't told me for the last seven years that, "Oh, Jess, you must specialize into using just one software, and then you can be known as the industry expert for that specific software." Today's training is probably the reason why I refuse to do that. It really comes down to the fact that tools are just tools, and they are to be used to serve a purpose for people. I really want to be sure that whenever I'm recommending something to you or whenever I'm setting something up for you, I recommend you use stuff that lets you implement your process in a way that it works for you, your business, your team members, your brain, and everything. I can't do that if I limit the choices of tools or software that I work with. That's something that I want to say from the beginning.

[00:05:00.900] - Jessica
Most things I'm going to say today are applicable no matter which tool you're choosing to use. I want us to focus more on the process and the idea behind what I'm talking about today rather than click here, click here, click here, click here because that changes every two weeks, to be honest. One of the first pieces of advice that new business owners are often given is when you are out of time, just hire a VA, and I 100% disagree. My first recommendation is that you look at your process and you check if it's actually as efficient as it possibly could be and then you look into, do you need to be doing all of those things or can you drop any of the things that you're currently doing? Then you're going to look at which part of the process can I automate so that no human has to waste their time copying things from A to B. And the things that are then remaining, they are the ones that I would outsource to somebody else if I have the funds to do so, okay? So my first piece of advice is actually to stop doing shit that doesn't get you any results. My second piece of advice is to automate the rest and then to hand off whatever can't be automated. Now basically, by the end of this presentation, I want you to understand how can I look at my blogging process and, what are my options for automating this process as much as possible.

[00:06:29.280] - Jessica
My starting pointer, whenever I talk about automations, whenever I talk about tools, when I talk about software, is that this is not about the tool. It's about you having a system that works for you and then finding the perfect tools to make that happen for you. That's why it's called a tool, okay? And using a tool or not using a tool does not make you successful. So just because a famous person here that you follow uses ThriveCart to sell their offers, that doesn't mean that you need to be using ThriveCart. It means that maybe it's a good product or it means that it's too expensive for you. It is not worth it for you. So please don't chase after shiny objects. This is something particularly I find in the digital content product space is something super common. Hey, there's a shiny new platform that does X. "I don't even do that in my business, but maybe I should sign up for it," alright? And that is not the way that anything is going to work out for you, right? So none of the trainings that I provide require you to use a exact specific type of tool. They are just all options, and you're going to need to pick the one that most suits you and your business, and what you want to automate.

[00:07:54.050] - Jessica
Now to me, there are three steps that you're going to go through when it comes to leveraging automation for your blogging process. The first thing that you have to do is you actually need a solid process that works before you're going to automate anything. The second thing is that you then need to develop a plan for actually being able to implement automation. The third thing you're going to do is to build out your system, test it, and then review it. I'm going to talk you through these three steps, and then I'm actually going to record a screen share, and I'll talk you through how I am going to be revamping some of my blogging process, which I've had on my list to do for the longest time. I'm going to set it all up, and I'm going to show you how it works, and then I'm going to show you how to set up the automation and how much of it can actually be done without me having to manually do anything, okay? Then I'll give you some action steps and also a way in which you can get more support.

[00:08:59.450] - Jessica
Let's kick it off. I talked about process, and I said that before you can automate anything in life, you need an actual process that works. That, unfortunately, requires you to do the thing manually many, many, many, many, many, many times. The next time that you publish new content on your blog, I want you to simple way, take pen and paper and write down. First I do this, then I do this, then I go here, then I make this. Then I download this file. Then I upload this here. Then I write this here. Then I put this here. I want you to write it all down from start to finish. Then once you've documented and written it down somewhere, I want you to actually look at this process because sometimes we do things in an order that doesn't make sense, and then we end up having to touch the same thing three times. So, do the task manually for a while, then document the process, and then work on making it really, really, really efficient. And that is the way in which I review any kind of process, particularly if there's multiple people involved. And then once it's working and you're sure that it is literally the leanest, thinnest process that it could be, it has the least number of steps, it has the least number of tool switches, only then you're going to be ready to actually look at automating and iterating on this process because a process is never final. Ideally, I would say once every three to six months, particularly if it's something you do a lot, you're going to want to review that process because tools change, systems change, things get updated. There could be a better way for you to be doing the thing that you're doing. To be honest, if you're publishing five, six, seven, eight posts or more a week and you shave 10 minutes off of the time that it takes to make that post happen, every week you're going to get an hour or more of your time back because there's 10 minutes you're not spending on nonsense, okay?

[00:11:10.460] - Jessica
Processes don't just get created once they get created, and then they get reviewed regularly and updated. If you don't know what you need to do, then you can't automate it. If you are listening to this right now and you're very new to blogging and you don't really know what you're doing yet and, you keep forgetting to do some of the things and then you have to come back to it a week later, what you need is you need a process that works. If you're at that stage, close this presentation. I think there's going to be an availability to purchase access to these presentations after, if I remember correctly, buy that and then come back to this in a little while because right now you need to focus on getting a process that works and you don't need to hear about automation because it'll fill your brain with stuff you're not ready for and this information will not go away. You can look it up again in three months time.

[00:12:04.580] - Jessica
Let's say you have your process. You are sure that this is like smooth AF from start to finish. There's no waste of time, no unnecessary tool switching. It is lean, lean, lean. Then next we're going to want to develop our plan for actually automating this process that you've written down. You need to look at all of the options out there for building automations that accommodate as much of your process as it currently is as possible. You're going to end up using some tools like, for example, Zapier or make.com, which used to be called, I think, Integromat. What you can and can't automate is entirely dependent on your tech stack. For example, if you write all of your content in Notion and you've chosen Zapier to connect Notion to WordPress, for example, then you're going to be limited in the data that you can send automatically from Notion to WordPress without having to copy and paste it. That is because Zapier is extremely slow with updating the API integrations. So if you are a heavy Notion user, then you're not going to want to sign up for Zapier, you're going to want to sign up for make.com because make.com has a way better integration with Notion. If you, however, do all of your blogging and you write all of your posts in your Google Drive account, then you're perfectly fine to use Zapier because there isn't any challenge with the integration with Google Docs because it's been running for years and years and years and years and a gazillion people use it. So it's a really good integration.

[00:13:54.580] - Jessica
So depending on the tools that you use in your blogging process, you're going to want to choose an automation software that actually works really well with those specific tools that you are using. And then once you have that picked, you want to try and automate as much of that as possible. And here's my honest recommendation. A lot of people get stuck when it comes to growing and optimizing their business because they are married to one specific tool. They love ConvertKit as an email service provider so much that come hell or high water, they will stick with ConvertKit. Even if there's another platform out there that does what they specifically need for their blog, for their business, it does that one million times better, faster, more reliably, more efficiently, whatever, they will still stick with ConvertKit and bang their head against the wall instead of just switching providers.

[00:14:53.880] - Jessica
My best recommendation is if you're currently handling your blogging process in a project management software that's really hard to integrate with anything else, switch flipping project management softwares to something else because there isn't anything that you can't figure out. It is an investment of maybe two, three hours to move your existing stuff from one project management software to another. But that allows you to access better quality automations, and therefore it is time you are not spending on manually doing things, or paying a virtual assistant to do instead of you. So not switching tools a lot of times can cost you a lot of money, and it's money you're basically throwing right out the window and you could be investing that into other things, okay? Then the last step, once we know what exactly the process is, we know which tools we can and can't use to automate it, the next step is to actually build out your system. As I said, sometimes the system that you can build is limited by your tools, and you should always consider changing it because it will help you in the long term to just turn this into a more successful venture.

[00:16:10.580] - Jessica
Now I'm going to actually go into a screen share on how I build out a system. I'm going to show you an example, very short process that I would like to have flowing and I would like to automate. Whenever I set up a new blog post in Notion, where I usually only note down the title of the post that I'm going to write, I want to automatically create a new Google Doc in a specific folder that is called 'Drafts,' and I want the title from Notion to be moved into that Google Doc automatically so that I don't have to create it. Then I'm going to write the content inside this Google Doc, manually. When I move that Google Doc to another folder called 'Final', then I want that content of that Google Doc to be sent to WordPress automatically, right? Then once the post is published, I would like to send this to my social media scheduler. I use Metricool, and in Metricool they have a feature called 'Autolists.' As soon as I've published a blog post, I would like it to automatically be added to one of my auto lists, all right?

[00:17:20.850] - Jessica
This is an example process.This is a very shortened version of all of the steps that go into writing a blog post. But this endless copying and pasting from one place to another, it always means that stuff goes missing and it's a lot of manual effort that I don't think I should have to be doing. I'm going to show you how to hopefully get all of this done and stay within the time limit of this lovely presentation. The first thing that I need to make sure that I have set up is in my Google Drive, I'm going to need a 'Blog folder' and I'm going to need the 'Drafts' and the 'Final' subfolder in here so that I'm ready to go. I also need to have my Notion database where I write down the ideas for new blog posts ready to go. I have that already because I currently use Notion to write all this stuff down.

[00:18:08.560] - Jessica
Then the next thing I'm going to need is I'm going to need an automation tool. In this case, I use Zapier already, so I'm just going to show you how to set this up in Zapier. But as I said, you could use make.com as well, particularly if you're using Notion to actually write your full blog posts and you want to continue to do that, you don't want to switch to Google Drive, then for sure you're going to want to use make.com, not Zapier. You're just going to go on the big button up here that says, "Create a Zap." Now, what is a Zap? A Zap is simply a connection between two tools that wouldn't usually be talking to each other. The way that a Zap works is that it always has a trigger and an action. "When this happens, do that." In this case, when I add a new database entry in Notion, then create a Google Doc in the folder called Drafts. This is basically the connection from this to this is the first step or the first Zap that we're going to set up. You can either write up here in this box. This works sometimes and not other times. I'm just going to manually set this up. The first app that triggers this whole process starting is Notion. Now I'm going to have to choose an event. In this case, I would say maybe it's going to be a new database item."Continue." My Notion account's already connected. If yours is not, there'll be a button here that says, "Connect" and then a pop-up will open and you just have to connect your account. Continue the trigger. Here, I need to choose the database that I would like to use. Here's my content repository, which is what I use in my template to store all of my content. Now it's found the database, it's going to test the trigger and it's going to make sure that it finds whatever item. This is actually going to be a blog post. That works fine. "Continue with selected record." Now the place where I want the action to take place is Google Docs. I'm going to select Google Docs and I would like it to "Create document from Text." "Continue, continue." Again, if your account isn't connected, you're going to have to connect your account. The document name is actually going to be the same as the Title of my Notion database entry. I'm just going to click on Title and it will dynamically pull in the title automatically from Notion. The document content for me is actually going to be blank, but blank isn't an option. I have to actually put something in the document. I'm just going to put the title in there again at the top of the document. Then I have to select the folder. "Here, Folder." Okay, so blog is here. And then inside Blog, I have the folder 'Drafts.' This is where I wanted to create this fresh Google Doc so I can work in it." Continue." Now it's going to ask you to test the action. You're going to say test step. If we now go into Google Drive and this is all worked, then we should find a document in there. It says, "A document was sent to Google Docs one second ago." Go in here, 'Drafts' and yes, here is the actual document that it's just created. And inside the document, we just have the title again because we couldn't leave it blank, right? This is now in my 'Drafts' folder and this is ready to go automatically for me to write my content into. This Zap now, where we would click 'Publish' up here, and then it's basically ready to go.

[00:22:13.480] - Jessica
Now I'm just going to go back out of here. We're going to press "Create Zap" again. Now the next step in my process, this is now done. When I create a new blog post in Notion, it automatically creates a Google Doc in a folder called 'Drafts.' Now, what I want to do is when I move that Google Doc to the folder called 'Final,' I want this to automatically create a draft post in WordPress so that I no longer have to copy and paste content into WordPress. So the trigger this time is Google Docs because that's where the action that I'm going to manually trigger actually happens. I'm going to say, "New document in folder" because I'm going to move that document to another folder. Whenever Zapier finds that I've added a new document into this Google folder that I'm going to select now, which is the 'Final' folder, because that's where I will move the document to. Whenever it finds a new document in the folder called 'Final,' it's going to test the trigger now. It won't find the document in there because at the moment the folder is empty, so I'm just going to skip the test. Then I wanted to perform an action and this action should take place in WordPress because that's where I go with my finished post and I wanted to create a post, "continue," I've already connected my WordPress account, if you haven't then you need to connect it. We're going to create a 'Post' and the 'Title' should be the title of the document. The 'Content' of the post in WordPress should be content of the actual document. The 'Excerpt' I haven't written, and I manually put that, the 'Author' is always going to be me. Then the 'Comment Status' for me is going to be open. The 'Format' is standard, it is non-sticky. 'Categories' and stuff I will set up later on and the 'Status' is going to be draft. "Okay, continue."  Now we're going to test this specific step with the document that it's found before. Now if we navigate to 'Posts' over here in WordPress, I should find that here is the Google Doc that I have created, and it is basically already uploaded in WordPress as a draft.

[00:25:02.350] - Jessica
Now I think I'm going to be pretty much coming up on time. Just to save some time, I pre-prepared this. Our last step is whenever a new post is published in WordPress, I want to add that post to an Autolist in Metricall, which is how I regularly recycle my blog content on social media. The event in WordPress is 'New Post' and the trigger is whenever the 'Post Status' is changed to 'Publish' because that's when it's live on the website. Then we go over here and we select 'Add Post to Autolist' in Metricall, which is my social media scheduler and it's awesome. You have to select the brand. I have two in my account because I have two different brands, so I select my one. I select my list, which is creatively called 'My blog posts.' Then as the post content, I'm just going to put in the excerpt from the blog post itself. Actually, yeah, I should probably after "read the full post here" link. Then you could attach media, but when you put the link on Facebook, it'll automatically pull the featured image, so I don't really need to do anything about that. "Continue, test step."  We'll send to Metricool and then go to Autolists over here and then on my blog posts — Yep, here it is.

[00:26:37.650] - Jessica
Okay, so as we all know, many people attend trainings every single day and buy courses and whatnot, and then they do nothing. So, what I want you to do is develop your process, one that literally is smooth AF from start through to finish, document it, then open a Zapier account, play around and see what are the different tech tools that you're using and what options come up in the list in Zapier.

[00:27:05.690] - Jessica
Then I want you to set up your automations and I want you to test them carefully and then make sure that everything works as you would want it to work. And then I want you to set a date on the calendar in six months time where you are going to review your blogging processes again, because technological development happens at absolute record pace right now. And I want you to make sure that you're using a process that is literally the most efficient it could be right now. And for that, unfortunately, you're going to have to keep coming back and reiterate on your process.

[00:27:39.400] - Jessica
Now, what if you need more support? So, sometimes when we look at something, it seems like something we can do, and then four or five, six days later, we've sat down and we've started the process ourselves and we are completely stuck. In that case, I can help. So many of the things that might take you weeks to figure out, I already know how to do, and I can do and I'll do it in a couple of hours and it usually doesn't take me near as long as clients think that I'm going to take to finish it.

[00:28:07.530] - Jessica
I actually offer Tech VIP days as well as day rates for ongoing clients. I don't work on retainer anymore at all. I actually really don't like retainers. So, if ever you feel stuck, you feel overwhelmed, you have something that you want to set up just once, then reach out to me anytime because I might be able to do it in two hours, four hours, or if you're building a really big funnel, I might need a full day for it. You can always reach me via DM, and usually just searching my name, Jessica Dornieden will get you there, or you can check it out at jessicadornieden.com/tech-vip-day.

[00:28:51.610] - Jessica
So don't feel like you have to struggle with this alone. There are so many people who really don't like the tech and who've learned to use it just fine, and I know that you can too. That's really it from me with automations for blogging, and I hope that this was useful, and I wish you a lot, lot, lot more fun with all the other presentations yet to come. Bye.
