Aisha Preece [00:00:12]:\
Hello, everybody. Welcome. Welcome. Welcome. Thank you so much for coming to my presentation, how to overcome procrastination and self doubt with your blog. My name is Aisha Preece, and I just want to apologize in advance if I sound stuffy. I've got a bit of a flu, a cold, so you might hear a bit of a bit of, coughing, but we'll we'll we'll we'll roll with it. Okay.\
\
Aisha Preece [00:00:34]:\
So welcome. Welcome. Welcome. Your time is so valuable. Let's get to it. So let me just quickly explain who I am because many of you may not know. You might be new to the Blogger Breakthrough Summit. I've I've, presented on the Blogger Breakthrough Summit of the last 3 years, and this is my 4th year.\
\
Aisha Preece [00:00:51]:\
It's a truly a privilege and an honor. I love Liz's summit. She adds value to so many of you. So thank you for having me, Liz. Thank you all for being here. So for those that don't know me, unfortunately, in October 2019, my best friend passed away suddenly. And it was a real wake up call for me because she was so young, so beautiful, so talented. And I decided that, you know, life's too short as we all have these realizations.\
\
Aisha Preece [00:01:17]:\
And I decided to change chase my dream of making an actual income from blogging. Because everyone talks about, I'm gonna be a blogger. I'm gonna be a blogger. But actually, can I actually earn from this blog? And I wanted to make that into a reality. But the truth is, and I know many of you will face this, it took me ages to have a breakthrough. You know, I went through the pain of I have no idea what I'm doing. I'm I'm taking all this action. I'm not taking action.\
\
Aisha Preece [00:01:41]:\
I'm procrastinating, but even the action I'm taking, I don't know if it's right. And it took me a lifetime and a half to have a breakthrough, but I did have a breakthrough. And I'll share in a moment how you can have a breakthrough. And once I had that breakthrough, I qualified for Mediavine, the lucrative advertising network, and I scaled my my, traffic on my my first blog to over 200,000 pages a month. So that's 2 of 2 of visitors. That's quite a lot. And, on top after that, I had a momentum, and I just decided to set up, so, 5 5 additional blogs, so 6 in total. And I hired a team.\
\
Aisha Preece [00:02:18]:\
I I I scaled, and my income grew to a point where it was more than my wildest dreams. So I grew I didn't grow up with much money. And so to me, it was a total different lifestyle change. Obviously, I didn't wanna get into lifestyle inflation, but I had more money than I ever ever dreamed of, and it was so, so exhilarating. And, you know, when you know, we think that the high is gonna be high forever. Right? But, unfortunately, I hit a slump after growing and saving and all this income and, you know, getting the success of blogging, getting interviewed on multiple podcasts. I hit a slump because in life, what goes up will go down, will go what goes down will come up. Life is cyclical.\
\
Aisha Preece [00:02:57]:\
Okay? And, unfortunately, as some of you will will know, the Google you know, there were Google updates that hit my site and that really knocked my confidence. And, unfortunately, someone who I really trusted, there was a friend in the blogging industry who also copied my courses. That was really tough on me. I lost my confidence, and I started to feel imposter syndrome again. I know I felt it at the beginning. I overcame it, and then I felt it again. And I just had no energy and motivation, to work on my blogs, and they began to drop. Quite honestly, I wanted to give up, and I thought that maybe blogging wasn't for me.\
\
Aisha Preece [00:03:32]:\
I wasn't cut out for it. And I just thought I don't deserve to teach. I I don't I'm not I'm not worthy of it. Anyway, after a full year of this going through going going through this, I got my head back into the right place, thankfully. And I'm gonna share a few actionable strategies that have really helped me, get my head right so I could continue blogging. And so, also, you can continue blogging too. Now having a strong mindset, we're gonna need it in many parts of our life, but when we're talking about blogging, you're gonna need it especially at the beginning. Because there's no university of blogging.\
\
Aisha Preece [00:04:09]:\
Right? You wanna study law, you go to a law school. You wanna study medicine, there's a guide, there's a path. There is a university of blogging, so it's very confusing and overwhelming. And this is when your mind needs to be the strongest. Number 2 is when things go right and then suddenly they go wrong, that's when you also need a strong mindset to get you through the bad times, to get you through the bad times, to go through the good times again. And so transforming my mindset has changed my life and allowed me to blog now for many, many years and, hopefully, for many years more. And, hopefully, it's gonna change yours too. Now if I keep looking right, it's kind of looking at the watch.\
\
Aisha Preece [00:04:44]:\
I don't wanna waste your time. I wanna make sure that this presentation is succinct and, it's in the time, you know, within the time duration. So quickly before I begin, I know that there's so many things that take up your time 24 hours a day. For one moment, I'm gonna ask you just put your phone, turn it around, get dedicate yourself. You got 5, 25 minutes left. Give yourself the gift of 25 minutes of just learning. Okay? Don't get distracted. Put your phone away.\
\
Aisha Preece [00:05:12]:\
Tell yourself, I'm gonna give myself 25 minutes a day to focus and really get my head right. You've got have you done that yet? Put your phone away, turn it around, put it on mute. Done? Cool. Let's move on. Now first things first, I want you to ask yourself, because you're at this Blogger Breakthrough Summit, what is the real reason your blog is not successful? What is the real reason that you're here today? Because I actually never understood the importance of a strong well trained mindset. I used to think, like, it was 0, like, eat, pray, love. Like, I didn't have time. I was like, give me the strategy.\
\
Aisha Preece [00:05:44]:\
Give me the strategy. I wanna know. Tell me what to do. I was like, I don't have time to sit around and journal and think of my thoughts. I don't have that luxury because time equals money. And that genuinely is the thought the the thought process I had before I changed the way I think. Because but here's the reality. Your blogging isn't successful generally due to two reasons.\
\
Aisha Preece [00:06:08]:\
1, you don't have the right strategy, and you'll learn that strategy. I know there's so many courses and trainings in this Blogger Breakthrough Summit that teaches you strategy. And I've taught strategy the last 3 years in the Blogger Breakthrough Summit, but I realized often we could have all the strategy on the course in the world, but we don't implement. Why? Because of our mindset. We think, oh, I don't have time. I procrastinate. I don't have motivation. I have impostor syndrome, and that's where the execution, the lack of execution comes in.\
\
Aisha Preece [00:06:39]:\
People think it's because of strategy and not the right strategy. You I'm sure many of you have bought expensive courses, but they haven't been implemented. Why? Because of your mind. I don't think I'm good enough. I don't think my writing's good enough. No one's gonna read my blog. I'm not getting the results, so this must mean I'm a failure. Execution is a hugely overlooked reason as to why your blog isn't succeeding.\
\
Aisha Preece [00:07:00]:\
And I'm saying this as somebody that has been blogging for a long time that runs 6 blogs. Okay? Now, unfortunately, we don't understand the cost of a of a weak mindset of not working on our mind. We say, I have time, I have money. I have time, I have money to work on my mind. If you do not, if you have all the strategy in the world, it won't make a difference if you second guess yourself. Oh, should I write this or should I write that? Should I do this strategy? Should I do that strategy? If you don't have any time or energy to work on your blog, that's all also to do with mindset. That's also to do with how you manage your mind. If you just don't have the motivation, oh, I don't feel like doing it.\
\
Aisha Preece [00:07:37]:\
You know, you could have the best strategy in the world, but if you don't feel like implementing it, nothing will happen. You could spend days working on one blog, trying to perfect it, overanalyzing, getting overwhelmed. Again, this has to do with mindset. This has nothing to do with strategy. And, also, a huge thing I know, bloggers, beginner, advanced, meet in, you know, intermediate, all of us face this feeling of comparisonitis. There's always someone out there who seems to be better than you, Okay? Who is doing better than you? And that stops us in our tracks. We're like, why do I even bother when everything I do is just not good enough? Okay? So if we didn't have any of this, then we will be able to be so much further with our blogs, and our blogs will be able to succeed. Right? Now I just wanna make sure the sound is on.\
\
Aisha Preece [00:08:23]:\
Okay? Yeah. The sound's on. Alright. So now if we move on to the next slide So the real reason so here's the thing. Right? The thoughts that we have in our mind become our actions, and so the thoughts you have are gonna actually change your life. And you've probably heard this again and again that sometimes we need reminders. Right? Like, you're gonna be going through so many courses and trainings today and tomorrow and on the Blogger Breakthrough Summit, but allow one of them to be about how to implement and execute with your mind. Okay? How can you have better, more productive, empowering thoughts? How can you have that? You train your mind.\
\
Aisha Preece [00:09:06]:\
You know, when we wanna we wanna lose weight, we wanna get 6 packs, we wanna go have abs, we go to the gym, we get a personal trainer. So why don't you get a personal trainer for your mind? Why don't we get training to improve the health of our minds? And I watched a documentary on f 1, Formula 1, and a lot of them, a lot of professional sports sportsmen and sportswomen, they have personal trainers for the mind because they understand how important they could have all the stress in the world physically, but mentally, if you're blocked, you will not get anywhere. Okay? So that's what I'm gonna teach you today. So let's talk about procrastination. So today, we're gonna talk about procrastination and self doubt. Now what are you gonna do if you feel like you're procrastinating? Again, let me just check the time to see how much time we have. Okay? So yeah. Okay.\
\
Aisha Preece [00:09:53]:\
So I'm just 10 minutes in. So first of all, let's just say you're procrastinating today. You're like, right. I'm procrastinating. I'm just taking so long. I want you to write down on your little notepad now. Why are you why are you procrastinating? There's a root reason, and we may not realize what it is. Is it that the thing that you're trying to do is actually really tough and you don't know how to do it? Because if that's the problem, then strategy will help you.\
\
Aisha Preece [00:10:17]:\
Like, it's it's the fact that it scares you and it overwhelms you because you're like, man, I don't know how to do this. It's too tough. That is what is procrastinating you. Okay. We've got ran to got to the root issue. Isn't you procrastinating because you think, man, I should do this, but, actually, I don't really wanna do it? Are you procrastinating because you're so worried that, oh, man, if I try this, if I feel a little dumb. So I I give the example of my YouTube channel. Right? I have procrastinated my YouTube channel from the beginning of time.\
\
Aisha Preece [00:10:48]:\
I run 6 blogs, social media channels, email marketing, email list for all of them. But the one thing I keep on procrastinating is my YouTube channel. Even though I know that it would you know, I think it would do well. I could help support my audience in a in a more long form content way. But I realized I was procrastinating, 1, because I didn't have the skill, like, the video editing skills. Number 2, I was procrastinating because I felt like I ought to have a YouTube channel, but, actually, the other things that I enjoyed and were bringing me more value were my Instagram, my email list, my actual blogs. And so write down what is the reason you're procrastinating. Let's get to the bottom of it.\
\
Aisha Preece [00:11:27]:\
You know, write it down. Number 2, here's a reality you may not wanna hear. I don't like to hear this reality. And someone told me this, and they said, if you procrastinate, it means that it's not as important as you think it is, and you are prioritizing something else that's more important. Because if you really wanted to make time, you would. I said, if you really wanted to make time, you would. And so for me, I had to ask myself, if I'm procrastinating my YouTube channel to work on my blogs, am I okay with that choice? If you're procrastinating something because you're on social media, because you're making time to go for trips with your friends, you're you're or you're making time for other things, if it's a conscious choice and you think that thing is more valuable, okay. Make peace with it.\
\
Aisha Preece [00:12:16]:\
But often, we are procrastinating mindlessly, not realizing that we are prioritizing other people, other things that don't fulfill our needs. Okay? And so are you okay with that? Are you okay with the fact that you are procrastinating on your goal because and you you can audit your time today. What have I done this whole day today? And instead of the thing that you wanna do, have you got on Instagram? Have you watched Netflix? Are you okay in 5, 10 years knowing you didn't achieve your goal with the fact that you decided to watch Netflix and go on on Instagram? Are you okay with that? And if you're okay with that, make peace with it. If you're not okay with it, it means that clearly Netflix and Instagram and social media are more important to you. And if so, why? Why are you making your boss more important than your personal goals? Why are you making other things more important? So the what is more important, if you truly think that thing you're procrastinating is a goal of yours, what is more important than that, and why is it more important? Ask yourself that because I had to ask myself, and I was really shocked by the answer. And number 3 is, let's just say you decided, alright. I've got I've got a mind mind flash. You know? News flash, I've decided that I don't wanna watch I'm not gonna watch Netflix every single night.\
\
Aisha Preece [00:13:31]:\
I'm gonna doomscroll. I'm gonna make I'm gonna make time. Cool. Okay. Let's let's go with that momentum and say, alright. The thing that you want to work on, don't be afraid to minimize the goal because I find I have too many goals and eventually end up getting nothing done. If you have 5, whittle it down to 2. If you have 2, whittle it down to 1.\
\
Aisha Preece [00:13:54]:\
Less is better when it comes to trying to execute because it prevents overwhelm. And then if you decide, okay. This is the goal I want. Break it down. Okay. I wanna get $2,000 for my blog. Okay. How is that gonna happen? I need to increase the traffic, and I need to monetize the traffic.\
\
Aisha Preece [00:14:12]:\
Okay. Step 1, how do I increase the traffic? What strategy? Am I gonna use Pinterest? Am I gonna use Google? Am I gonna use it? What are the strategies you're gonna use to increase traffic? Break it down further. Oh, I'm gonna use, Pinterest. Okay. What are the things I need to do to to ensure ensure that Pinterest gets traffic? Step 1, I need to write the blog post. Step 2, I need to create pin no. Step 1, I need to find you keyword research. Then I need to write the blog post, then I need to create pins.\
\
Aisha Preece [00:14:40]:\
See these break it down break it down. Okay. You broke it down. Now you've got the what, you've got the how, when are you gonna do it? Because if you do not allocate the thing, the task, and if you don't see those tasks in your schedule, they will not happen. Here's that is here's a relative. You say, oh, I'm gonna write a blog post. I'm gonna write a blog post. I'm gonna write a blog post.\
\
Aisha Preece [00:15:02]:\
But you do not see, I'm gonna write a blog post on Thursday after dinner. You if you don't visualize it and you don't see it, you don't carve out that time, it will not get done. And so for me, I have to I have, like, a calendar oh, you can't really see it. But I have a calendar Monday to Friday to Monday to Sunday, and I say, okay. Today, I'm gonna do this. So tomorrow, I'm gonna do that. You have to carve out the time to to work on the task that you've just broken down. So you say, alright, keyword research.\
\
Aisha Preece [00:15:31]:\
I'm gonna find 5 new topics for Pinterest. Okay. When are you gonna do that? So what you have right? When are you gonna do it? I'm gonna do it, after dinner tomorrow, and so I'm gonna maybe one day, I'm gonna skip the gym instead of going more often. I know it's not good for your health, but if it's a temporary thing, after dinner, I'm gonna give myself one hour, and I'm gonna do find find 5 new topics. Alright. Schedule that in. Boom. Done.\
\
Aisha Preece [00:15:59]:\
You hand in, you can tick it off. What are you doing? How are you doing it? When are you doing it? And when you when you already plan your every Sunday, I plan my week. Every Sunday, I look at the week ahead and say, what am I doing and when am I doing it? I write the list of things I need to do, then then I input those tasks in the week. So if I don't if I don't see it, it doesn't happen. If it's there so, you know, wake up in the morning and I straight away, boom, I need to work on this, this, and this. This is what I've allocated for the day. The tasks that I wanna do. Not the goal.\
\
Aisha Preece [00:16:28]:\
The tasks that are gonna bring me to the goal. So it makes it more actionable. Okay? So now let's just say you've you've another thing that's gonna help with procrastination is you know your distractions. Cut we know we know our distractions. For me, people distract me. I love I love chatting. Right? So I love talking to people. My family and my family live near, my husband.\
\
Aisha Preece [00:16:51]:\
I find the best way for me to get lots of lots of work done and focus on my tasks is I just have to get up earlier. I know it's not easy, but, like, I'll get up at 6 AM or sometimes 5:30. Not every day. I can't do that. And then some of you superwomen and supermen can do that, but I can't. And I know. Excuse me. On the days or the weeks that are pretty busy, I just get up early and say, no one disturb me.\
\
Aisha Preece [00:17:15]:\
It's quiet. Minimize distractions. You need to put yourself in a position where it's easy. If your phone is distracting you, put your phone in another room. If it's your kids that are distracting you. Okay? How are you going to plan for 1 hour, get your partner to look after 1 hour, get your family to look after 1 hour, book a babysitter if you can afford it. You need to minimize the distractions so you can really focus on that task. You know what those distractions are.\
\
Aisha Preece [00:17:39]:\
Okay? And so for me, people distract me. So what I do is I get up super early when when no one's up. Okay? Now another thing that really helps me with procrastination is accepting that 80% is better than nothing. For example, right, this presentation, I'm quite sick. I have a renovation going on, and I kept on procrastination. I said, I'll do it tomorrow because there'll be less noise. I'll do it tomorrow. I'll feel better.\
\
Aisha Preece [00:18:06]:\
And I said, you know what? I'd rather show up and teach something that's valuable, hopefully valuable for you. And it'll I show up coughing. I show up snotty with a bit of noise in the background. They're not show up at all. Sometimes you just gotta show up, and 80% is better than nothing at all. Okay? So if you wanna do some keyword research, hey. Listen. If you come up with 3 keywords instead of 5, no problem.\
\
Aisha Preece [00:18:28]:\
Something is better than nothing. Okay? So I want you to show up regardless of if if it's you show up ugly, show up lazy, show up snotty. 80% or even 20% is better than nothing. Okay? Now here's a reality that people don't talk about. Right? They think once you start, it's gonna you know, think you're gonna get in the state flow. Or is it what's it called? You guys know better. Put in the chat. It's called the flow, the state of flow or whatever.\
\
Aisha Preece [00:18:55]:\
Every single time I try something new or a task that's quite challenging, it is extremely painful. And I get angry. I'm like, this is painful. Like, even creating this presentation, I felt a bit of overwhelm and impostor syndrome. I was like, oh, I don't know if I'm teaching the right thing. It's painful to go through that, but I want you to work through those steps and have a tolerance to pain. If this feels painful, this feels uncomfortable, I'm doing it even if it feels uncomfortable. Okay? And so if you don't really know how to write a blog post, you feel like your blog post is a bit shitty, you feel, you know, you're you're it's it's like you're overwhelmed.\
\
Aisha Preece [00:19:32]:\
I want you to work through the painful stuff. It's painful. It's uncomfortable. We accept it, but we continue taking action. It's meant to feel like that. And then like a muscle, you know, when you work at the gym, the first few times are very painful. Right? Your muscles hurting. And after a while, your muscles get used to it.\
\
Aisha Preece [00:19:49]:\
You get into the flow of things. It's exactly the same with any task that you're working on. Now and the price that I told you, to make those break those tasks down as much as possible. So remember how we said, I you wanna earn $2,000 a month, so we're gonna break it down. Traffic times monetization equals income. Alright. We're gonna break it down further. Traffic.\
\
Aisha Preece [00:20:09]:\
Okay. How we're gonna get the traffic? Maybe Pinterest. How we're gonna get the Pinterest traffic? We move backwards. So let's just say you did 5 new keywords. Take that. Give us a pat on the back. Make these tasks small so you can reward yourself along the way. Don't just reward yourself for the result.\
\
Aisha Preece [00:20:28]:\
Reward yourself for taking action because the actions are gonna bring us results. Often, we measure ourselves with results, don't we? We're like, what how do I achieve this? I wanna achieve why. I don't measure myself with results. I measure myself with actions. How many actions have I taken today? When I look at my to do list at the end of the week, I don't say, did I achieve x? I say, did I do x? Did I finish the task that I said that I was set out to do? Because if you do the actions, the results will naturally come. And then what happen is you will get momentum. Once you've gone through the pain and you keep on going through, you will get momentum. And once you have momentum, it's really hard to stop you.\
\
Aisha Preece [00:21:07]:\
Okay? So now you're just at the point now you're procrastinating. I want you to I want you to work through it. I want you to work through the pain. I want you to break it down, and I want you to carve out time and work through the painful actions, and suddenly you'll get momentum. Okay? Now the second thing I'm gonna teach you today is self doubt and, self doubt. Okay? So what happens is another big thing that stops us from succeeding in our blogs is we feel imposter syndrome, and we feel, I don't feel I'm good enough to write this. I don't feel I'm good enough to teach this. I don't think I know enough to create this digital product.\
\
Aisha Preece [00:21:45]:\
I don't feel I know enough to write this top content. And this is basically imposter syndrome and self doubt. Now I've got the reality check for you guys and goals. Okay? You do not need to be the the most knowledgeable to teach. You just need to be 1 step ahead, and I'm gonna give you a practical example. Okay? Now I've said this before, and if you follow my Instagram, I've said I've said this before where I'm actually quite terrified to have children. I don't have children right now. I have I have a cat.\
\
Aisha Preece [00:22:14]:\
You know, she's my child. But the thought of having children actually terrifies me because I'm like, how am I gonna take care of a child when I can't even take care of myself? Okay? But the thing is, if I was to ever have a kid or want to have a kid, I might do, you know, I would rather learn from a mom who is just a new mom in the trenches learning and implementing there's somebody who's a doctor, who's got it all figured out, perfect life. I just I'm gonna learn from somebody who's just right ahead of me, who's in the trenches, learns, has actionable strategies. Similarly, for blogging, if I say, oh, I'm making $1,000,000 a month for my blogs. I have a huge team. You know, I I'm I wanna have it all figured out. I think I'd be quite unrelatable, but you know I'm running these 6 blogs. I'm in the trenches learning when Google updates are happening.\
\
Aisha Preece [00:23:08]:\
I'm learning new strategies, learning different email marketing, and I'm teaching them along the way. So I find my students find that more relatable. They can relate to me more. Similar with you, if you're like a pro gardener, I think it's a much less relatable if you're like, you know, on a cooking show compared to a mom who's, like, trying to cook with kids and, like, have nutritious meals. I think being able to be one step ahead actually is your competitive advantage. So you don't actually need to be perfect. You don't need to be 1 step ahead. You know, oh, I figured I had to make my kids sleep for 1 night.\
\
Aisha Preece [00:23:43]:\
I'm gonna teach that. It may not work every night, but I wanna learn that strategy. Right? I've learned how not to kill my basil plants. Share that tip. You know? So I think being one step ahead is is actually might way more valuable than being super, super experienced. Number 2, here's what I've realized. Right? You can make it click with your personality and your experience. How many times, right, we've heard a topic so many times, but then it takes one person to finally make it click.\
\
Aisha Preece [00:24:13]:\
It was like that for me with Google traffic and with Pinterest. I took so many courses, but it was one particular teacher that was, like, the way that he taught made it click for me. I was, like, oh. And then it implemented it. Same with you. Right? You might have a way of connecting with somebody that that in a way communicating in a way using your personal experience that can make it click for them. So whatever you're teaching, don't worry if someone is more experienced than you because you're gonna be able to connect connect with a person who is similar to you. So I'm at you know, for example, I might relate better to women.\
\
Aisha Preece [00:24:51]:\
I'm half Asian, half English. You know, maybe I can relate to a different part of the world too. Whereas, there are men that wanna learn from men, And, you know, I'm just saying that you can make a click with your personal experience. Okay? And that's very valuable. And number 3, and this is a big thing, and I'm really guilty of it. Right? Often, I think, I just wanna take one more course. One more course, and then I'm ready. One more training, one more bit of coaching, and then I can I can teach this? I can do this.\
\
Aisha Preece [00:25:19]:\
And to be honest, you could take all the courses in the world, but it's a bit like swimming. You could take all the courses you want about swimming, but unless you get in the swim and practice, you're not gonna be ready. Okay? So with your blog excuse me. Taking action on your blog, making mistakes, failing repeatedly is going to build up your skills so you learn what not to do and what to do, and you will feel ready. This this taking action is what's gonna help you overcome your self doubt. Okay? Not doing more courses. And I know you're here taking lots of courses, but I just wanna remind you, it's a bit like swimming. You need to get in there and swim.\
\
Aisha Preece [00:25:54]:\
Okay? Now another thing that really, really helps us. For the longest time, I could not understand why my Instagram works. My Instagram is, compared to, like, big influencers, quite small. Okay? But it's grown over time. And I said, why my Instagram is like, I look like I haven't combed my hair. There's no there's no rhyme or reason. There's no strategy. It looks pretty sporadic, but it works.\
\
Aisha Preece [00:26:18]:\
It makes me money. They're engaged. People in my community respond to my polls, get great feedback. I was like, why is it that this why does my Instagram work? And I realized because I'm not afraid to share the good and the bad. When things go wrong, when shit hits the fan, when I get Google updates, when I get troll comments, when I get bad experiences, when I fail, I share that on my Instagram and people relate to that. That vulnerability, that self doubt that you're feeling, it makes you human. It makes because everyone feels it whether they like to admit it or not. And when you make when you show up as a real human in this world of AI, that is what makes people connect with you.\
\
Aisha Preece [00:26:58]:\
So your self doubt in a way makes you human, and if you take action anyway and you share it, I think it really, really helps. And so finally, there's a saying shame hides in the dark. Right? If you come out and you admit your shame and you admit your self doubt, you are not giving you are you are you are removing the power that self doubt has over you. For example, right, for example, I've always said with my content and with my example, you look at my Instagram. Right? I am not the typical influencer. Like, half the days, I I don't wear makeup. I I don't comb my hair. I can look quite scruffy.\
\
Aisha Preece [00:27:36]:\
I try my best not to. I try to show up in a presentable way, but I say it. I say, listen. I am running a whole business. I have a whole husband, bought a house. I'm I'm just with countries. Life is life in right now. And to be honest, I don't look like I don't look all put together.\
\
Aisha Preece [00:27:54]:\
And I come out and I say it. So it's almost like, oh my god. Like, your hair is so messy. I'm like, yeah. I know that. I said it. I told you. I told you my hair looks messy.\
\
Aisha Preece [00:28:03]:\
Or if they say, oh my god. You look so disorganized. I know. I told you. I've got, like, I've got a lot of things in life going. So if you come out and talk about things that you're feeling embarrassed about, hey, guys. I feel like, you know, I wanna teach gardening, but sometimes my my sometimes my my my my my basil dies. Sometimes my my peas don't wanna pea.\
\
Aisha Preece [00:28:26]:\
They don't wanna come out. Talk about it. Come out and say it, and shame is like mold. You shine light on it, and it will it will cower away because then you own it and you stand up and say, I'm gonna show up regardless if I'm feeling like this, regardless if I'm showing up ugly. It's okay. It's okay to show up ugly and doubtful. Okay? I just want you to say, like, anything that you wanna teach it and you're feeling so bad, talk about it. Talk about it, and people will relate and have empathies towards it.\
\
Aisha Preece [00:28:57]:\
Okay? Now so far so good. Let me check time. How we doing? We still here? Thank you if you're still here. Oh, little bit much time yet. Okay. So we got some cool stuff for you. No wink. I'm gonna wink you away.\

I got some cool stuff for you. Alright. If you have any questions, please put them in the chat. We can answer them. And, also, I've got a freebie just for you. I I created this just for you. Okay? So I created some training, some personal training just for you. These are actual recorded trainings.\
\
Aisha Preece [00:29:26]:\
Often, people are you guys I know you guys, I felt it too. You will feel like they have all the motivation in the world, but you have energy.

**Transcript:**\
Alex Waggoner [00:00:12]:\
Hello. Hello. And welcome to the training for taking overwhelm from overwhelm to taking quick action project management system every blogger needs. I'm so excited to help you get your blogging systems organized so you can quickly scale into a successful blog in 2025. So a quick introduction. Hello. I am Alex. I'm an online business manager at Tech VA for the past 5 years, and here are a few key things to remember me by if you ever see my name pop up in the online space.\
\
Alex Waggoner [00:00:42]:\
So I'm a verified ClickUp consultant. I adore ClickUp, and you will be hearing some tips I have as far as using ClickUp, to streamline some of your systems and workflows. And I also love travel. It's the reason I started my online business. My brand is about it it's a nomadic entrepreneur. I love travel and I've had the privilege of working remotely from 15 countries and counting and yes I think it is incredible how we have this location independence available to us. And I also love a scary movie, it is my favorite genre of movies. And I'm a huge astrology nerd with my big three being a, Sagittarius sun, Virgo Moon, and Gemini rising.\
\
Alex Waggoner [00:01:22]:\
So let's dive into the good stuff, shall we? So today, we'll get we're gonna be talking about the challenges bloggers face with project management, the benefits of having those strong project management skills in place and how they can impact your success, essential tools for bloggers that will help you scale long term, some tips for staying organized, and some techniques to stay organized and productive as well. And yeah. So challenges. So any of these could be impacting your ability to scale long term. So first things first, of course, is managing content production. That is the number one skill that is required to take that hobby into a career. It's it can be overwhelming at first to try to keep track of all those little bits and bobs of information when it comes to creating high quality content. I will be showing you a template or included in this training is a free template for my tried and true blog post tracker.\
\
Alex Waggoner [00:02:22]:\
It is how I recommend keeping track of all of your blog posts, not only when you first create them, but to maintain them long term because that is one piece of blog post management is we forget that we also need to go back and update things and managing that production of not only just initial creation, but maintenance and updates is part of that challenge. So you're most likely not just posting content in your blog as well. You also probably have additional, you know, social media channels that you wanna share your content on Pinterest. There's all of these different areas that we need to scatter our content on the internet in order to reach the most amount of people. So getting that system is definitely a strong challenge. And maybe you also have things like writing, like you have a team of writers, that's also a pretty common thing that you might have as far as your content production goes. So there's a lot of different bits and bobs that you need to keep track of when creating content. Collaborations is another additional challenge that you have to keep track of.\
\
Alex Waggoner [00:03:23]:\
So you'll be once you get started and really start to build up a momentum as far as your traffic goes, you'll start to get guest posts and then additional digital events like this one, like a summit or bundle, and you want to make sure you have all of that information organized and set up for success so you can look professional long term. So you can meet meet certain due dates and remember all of the different places that you've been that you have shown up long term. And then another additional thing is time management, once you start doing this path you become self employed in some capacity and how you spend your time is directly connected to your income when you're fully self employed. If you're just getting started, even just like a little bit, having good time management skills is essential, especially if you're only you only have, like, 5 hours a week to dedicate to your blog, then having good time management skills is essential. You want to have a clear idea for how long your tasks will take and how to fit those into your calendar, which we will talk a bit about shortly. Benefits. So some benefits of having strong project management skills. So we just discussed the challenges that you can face as a blogger getting started or even just as a blogger who is already working and you could already have a ton of, like, a pretty high level traffic skill and you want to focus on scaling to that next level of your income and impact.\
\
Alex Waggoner [00:04:58]:\
So some benefits of having these strong project management skills in place to take you from being overwhelmed to just executing is increased output as a creator. So once you have clear systems in place, it's easier and you can your brain can kind of turn off and you can just start creating once you have a clear system in place. And you can also relax because you have that externalized brain that you trust. Right? So it's more it's not just having like a list of blog post, a list of blog posts to keep track of which if that's enough, then that's enough. Right? But what we want is a system that we can trust through those project management skills so we don't have to second guess anything that we have as far as our systems go. It's also easier to outsource to a virtual assistant. Once you get to a certain point where you've built up enough income or you just have a little extra money to invest into your blog, you might want to consider outsourcing to a virtual assistant to help you with some of those more mundane tasks that there's there's always a lot of little bits and bobs you have to keep track of with the tech, with the updating text, with, you know, link management, all of that kind of stuff. It's just helpful to have that second person to support you.\
\
Alex Waggoner [00:06:18]:\
It also has increased it increases your professionalism, you're organized, you meet your deadlines, and all of that jazz, and it is easier to be flexible and adaptable with your new ideas when you have systems and project management skills in place to quickly be able to assess whether or not you can say yes to something. And yeah. So essential project management tools for bloggers. So the first thing, when it comes to being a blogger, there are a couple of tools that are a part of included in your what I call your operations suite, which is a specific tech stack that helps you manage the operations of your blog slash business. And one thing that I think is very important here is to make that mindset swap from blog as a hobby, you know, just like a passion project to a business. And once you make that step and that mental conversion, then it can the importance of these tools kinda falls into place. So first things first is your task and project management tool. Naturally, I recommend ClickUp, but there are a couple of other options that I recommend depending on the person.\
\
Alex Waggoner [00:07:32]:\
Everyone's different, and some other additional options worth exploring are Notion and Airtable. And then additionally, we have your communication tool. So this is essential when you start outsourcing and working with other people, whether that is with a virtual assistant, a branding company, a copywriter, a blog, like a writer's team if you have a team of people, a couple of tools I recommend for that are Slack and Voxer depending on the robustness of your team. If you have a larger team then I would definitely use Slack, but Voxer is also good for anything, like, if it's just like a quick couple of people, you know, I would say max, like, 2 people on a team in addition to yourself, but otherwise, I would use Slack, just to keep everything outside of your personal world versus, like, a text or email. It's I can go on about this for a while, but the main thing is get it out of your email or your text messages because you wanna have those work life balance boundaries, and then additionally, your time management tool. So this is doesn't have to be anything fancy. I recommend Google Calendar, but essentially, it's your calendar tool that you use because I recommend time blocking out your time so you can visually see where you're spending your time. And that includes, like, if you're working a full time job, I would include, like, time blocking that out in your calendar so you can see visibly what you have time to complete.\
\
Alex Waggoner [00:09:03]:\
So when you're setting your goals, you're not just, like, throwing spaghetti at a wall and hoping it sticks, and instead you're being intentional with, like, okay. I know I only have 5 hours this week to dedicate to my blog. I can't expect myself to produce 30 blog posts that are high quality. Maybe you can if you're a a champion at producing blog post content but depending on your workload, that's just it's one of those things where you need to assess what you're capable of producing and connecting that to time and when you gain that skill, it will really help you scale long term. And then lastly is your content calendar tool. This can sometimes be, like, integrated with your task and project management tool. The system I am showing you is integrated into ClickUp, which it can also be a task and project management tool, but it's really helpful to have, like, a visual content calendar so you can see, like, when content is going live, especially if you have, like, multiple platforms that you're posting content on, like email marketing, social media, all of that. So you can get that, like, overarching view of what's going on in your content.\
\
Alex Waggoner [00:10:09]:\
And yeah. So next, let's talk about tips for staying organized, not just to get organized, but to stay organized using your systems because that's really the goal. It's not just, like, one goal or being organized isn't just one achievement that you hit and then you're done. It is an ongoing process which can be met through having clear systems in place. One way I like to do this is through brain brain dumps. So getting information out of your head and into, like, some externalized documented format so you can, go through when creating your project plans and all of that. So I prefer using a Notion database to collect my ideas because it's you can have, the widgets on your phone, I have an iPhone, I don't, I would imagine you can do this on Androids as well but if you get the widget for Notion on your phone where you can have like the favorited, pages on the widget, you can bookmark that so then it's really easy to just open that up real quick and then make note of whatever your idea is. So you can set reminders to, like, every week go through your brain dump list so you can see, like, okay, where do I have, like, blog post ideas? Because sometimes it's not only just, like, blog post content, right? Like it might be, like, a digital product ideas, it might be, I don't know, you want to redesign your bathroom.\
\
Alex Waggoner [00:11:31]:\
Right? Like, there's it's a place for you to just, like, externalize your brain so you don't forget things. And having, like, a system to remind you to go back and check it every week or every month can be helpful to keep you organized and out of your head. And then next tip for staying organized is store everything in one place. I think this is a good rule of thumb for just everything in your digital world of files and ecosystem things, because the main reason for this is you don't wanna have to update information in multiple places. So if you have, especially if you have a team, this can be overwhelming to have like multiple places to update, you know, like the blog post title is one thing that I would consider here. Now, of course, in certain places, it's unavoidable to I'm thinking, okay. So in a blog post tracker, of course, you'll have the blog post title in your site, like, on whatever's published on your site, and then in your tracker, you can set up things with automations to connect things, but I definitely recommend having, like, a tracker to remember and sort, like, statuses for your blog posts, but you'll want to just have 1. Like, I wouldn't have multiple lists, like, if you have a blog post writing team, I wouldn't have multiple spreadsheets where you have to update, you know, like, okay, this is one like, I would have it in one system that you can easily keep track of and just train everybody on it as opposed to, like, having different customized solutions for every single person.\
\
Alex Waggoner [00:13:13]:\
It'll just reduce your headache a lot, long term because you won't have to train yourself in 5 different ways and you will just have one system that's easy to easy to remember. And then next is to create a roadmap. Now I know that might not be the most intuitive for, like, staying organized, but it is actually very helpful because when you get into this energy of planning ahead your plan might shift and that's okay but having that long term vision to work towards is really helpful to make sure you're continuing to meet that goal. Because sometimes when we say we wanna get organized, we get overwhelmed by all of the options to, like, have to clean up, but if you create a road map and you're like, okay, I just wanna make sure that my blog post system is organized and easy to follow by the end of this quarter, like that's your quarterly goal, it's a lot easier to, you know, like keep that self confidence, keep that momentum going as opposed to being like I want my entire business organized by the end of the quarter. And depending on the state of your business, that might not be a a an achievable goal. And that's okay. Right? Like, we are allowed to pick away at things versus just being, like, suddenly perfect. So, yes, creating a roadmap will help you stay organized long term.\
\
Alex Waggoner [00:14:30]:\
So next steps, how to start taking action and actually implementing this into your business. The first thing I would recommend doing is tracking your time to get real how long something takes for you. So I would do this with writing blog posts, I would do this for managing team members if you have a team, I would do this for any kind of bit and bob that you'd work on for your blog and when it comes to even like writing a blog, I would break it down to like writing the blog post and then like the tech setup or like any of that kind of more admin stuff and maybe designing a blog post if you do a lot of photos, Like, if you're a travel blogger who has a lot of, like, you know, custom photos that you work through and all of that, like, you wanna make them very I mean, I wouldn't go insane, but yeah. Now I'm thinking maybe having design. Like, designing your blog post is the tech. You know? Like, so setting up all of the, like, making sure all the tracking elements are correct and all of that. So boiling down to make sure you track your time so you can get real on how long something takes. So when you time block out your calendar, you know what you need to do.\
\
Alex Waggoner [00:15:40]:\
Next is create that roadmap specifically on a quarterly basis. What do you want to complete every single goal for the next year for 2025? What would you like to achieve by the end of Q1, Q2, Q3, and Q4? That's a whole another training in itself, but it's a good thing to start training your brain into thinking in those quarterly milestones. And then choosing a content management tool. So if you haven't established one already, this is essential because you want to make sure you have a clear system for managing your content. I will show you briefly the ClickUp template that I have, but I think that this is an essential step in your process of being a blogger. And then finally, implement and adjust. So we want to have a growth mindset with this process as opposed to just not doing it correctly the first time and then never doing it again. It's okay to not follow a plan perfectly.\
\
Alex Waggoner [00:16:42]:\
It's okay to not achieve a goal. It is okay to write down a goal at the beginning of a quarter and then never look at it again. But we still wanna go back and we still wanna make sure we are working towards these goals of tracking your time, creating a roadmap, and using a content management system, because it will benefit you greatly as you start to scale your blog. And yes. So let's look at the click up templates for bloggers very quickly. I'm gonna pause my recording one sec. Alright. So if you're not familiar with ClickUp, this is what ClickUp looks like.\
\
Alex Waggoner [00:17:20]:\
And I have a few different resources for how to use ClickUp on my site, so definitely check that out. If you're like, I have no no idea where to even begin with this, don't worry. I'm not gonna focus too much on the basics for this just to show you kinda, like, the things that are helpful as a blogger. But if you're new to ClickUp, definitely check out my site. So the first thing I would like for y'all to see is there's these 3 different views here. So this little light bulb, this is the place where anything that is an idea, this is where your blog post ideas go, Any blog post that you're currently working on creating is here and then all of your published ones will go here. Now how ClickUp works is each row in a list is a task. So this is one task, but I also want you to kind of think of like this as more of a database for the purpose of this template.\
\
Alex Waggoner [00:18:15]:\
So this individual, task is 1 blog post and how this works. So there's a couple of custom fields here where you can keep track of all of this information as far as, you know, like the status of the blog post. So like if this blog post was set to the status of idea or published or needs updates, it would go to the according corresponding view up here. So if it was under the idea status, it would go over here. I'll show you that real quick. And then if it was under published, it would go here. We're not gonna do that. I'll ignore that for now.\
\
Alex Waggoner [00:18:56]:\
It will be over here. So this helps you keep track of that bird's eye view of what blog posts you currently have. Now when you open up this blog post or this task, excuse me, you'll see that there is actually I'm gonna show you real quick. You'll see first that there's this 0 to 27, 0-27, bit here, this is a checklist. This shows that there's a checklist inside of this task. So it's all of the little, like, bits and bobs you need to keep track of when doing a blog post. That can be found under action items if you see this 3 bars here or just continue to scroll down in the task and you'll find all of the all of the checklists. There's a couple of different phases as far as creating a checklist goes and that includes like writing the post.\
\
Alex Waggoner [00:19:44]:\
Right? Like so we have headline titles, actually drafting the post itself, and then there's all of the bits you have to do for confirming the tech is ready to go, right? So like updating the categories, confirming authors, updating the permalink so whatever you link to on your site, like all of these little bits and bobs that we might forget, this is how you capture that to make sure you're actually achieving everything you wanna get done for your blog post. I'm not gonna go through every single bit here. If you have any questions, please feel free to reach out. There is an option to do that in your like where you'll find this template. And then one thing I also recommend doing is and this is overkill. This is so overkill. But I do recommend having the actual blog post copy inside of this task. So it's every single bit about your blog, that single blog post is in this task because then you can, if for whatever reason your blog goes away, like it crashes or you lose your site or for whatever reason, like that's the worst possible scenario.\
\
Alex Waggoner [00:20:50]:\
But if that does happen, you have the safeguard of still having the content. Of course, the site should hopefully be me and like hopefully that will never happen, this is just a safeguard, but it is one nice feature to keep track of everything so you don't lose that content. And yeah, so I hope that one sec. So I hope that you found a ton of different little takeaways for this from this training, and I really hope that you start implementing the use of this template. If you have any questions regarding it, please let me know and I will help you out because I know it's, it's a big tool to get started with. But, yeah, I hope you enjoy the template.\

Amber Lozzi [00:00:33]:\
Absolutely. Well, as you mentioned, my course automation education was actually the course that was included in the Genius Bloggers toolkit a couple of years ago. And one of my key to successes, I would say, is the fact that I'm able to implement automated marketing in such a way that we don't sever that connection with our audience. Right. And so, while I cover a whole lot of steps to automated marketing within my course, today we're going to be talking about the five key steps that I have found to automated marketing made simple. And again, to automated marketing that is done in such a way to where your audience still feels that genuine, authentic connection that is key to making sales.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:01:17]:\
Yeah, because there's a lot of marketing automation you could do, but it's just.\
\
Amber Lozzi [00:01:22]:\
Like set it and forget it and.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:01:23]:\
Then you're not connecting with people. But marketing is so important to successful blog and business. So I'm really excited.\
\
Amber Lozzi [00:01:30]:\
Me too. Absolutely.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:01:31]:\
All right, so let's go ahead. I'm going to let you take over and I'm excited to learn from you.\
\
Amber Lozzi [00:01:36]:\
And take some notes. All right, everyone, let's go ahead and jump right in. Again, this is automated marketing made simple. With yours truly, Amber Tamari Lozzi. Now, if you are new to who exactly I am, what it is I've got going on, I want to start off by telling you that I've been on this adventure for nearly 20 years. So back in the days of MySpace and GeoCities and yes, even good old Neopets, I was there learning HTML, learning coding and learning about blogging. Back when it was web blogging. I don't know if anybody even has heard that term. I guarantee you if I said that to a 20 year old, they'd go, how? What? Now? It was a lifestyle, it was a journal of sorts and clearly it has evolved far beyond what it used to be, but that was and still is to this day a big part of my life. And I always say that as a sort of caveat to introducing my story because when people hear about my success, they often think, oh, I want to do it that quickly. I want to make that happen as soon as she did. And so I always want to remind them that, again, this is something I've been building towards since I was a kid. Now, before I launched my first for profit blog, I used to work at a local community college teaching organizational leadership, marketing. I worked very closely with a lot of the student clubs and organizations to help them learn how best to market not only their clubs, but themselves as they transitioned into either a four year university or transitioned out into what we call the real world. Now, as much as I loved my students, I did not love the politics that come with working in higher ed. It just wasn't for me. And so when I was passed over for a much deserved, much looked forward to promotion despite having put in 50 60 hours a week and was there despite having to take care of my kids and be a full time mom nearly while also being this full time employee working towards again what I thought was going to be the job of my dreams. I said I'm done. I can't do it. And now again, I've got two kids, I've got a little boy who is six and then a little girl who will soon be five. And together we are all kind of kooky, quacky, wild, crazy, but it's life, and it's life that I love. And so when I was passed over for this promotion, I really, to be honest, was devastated. I thought, what am I going to do with my life? I was barely bringing home two and a half dollars because I was paying for daycare and all that good stuff. And yet again, I was putting in all of these extra hours at work and I just felt like I was drowning and I couldn't do it anymore. And so my husband, who you see pictured there, had been talking for two years about launching his own blog, about becoming the next Pat Flynn, the next Mr. Money Mustache. And I said, yeah, let's do that. Like, yes, please. And just talked and talked and talked and talked. Right. We've all been there. You get analysis paralysis or you get stuck in the thousands of to dos that come with launching a blog. And so in November of 2015, I launched Thrifty Guardian, which again was my first for profit blog. I didn't expect to make a lot of money from it. I didn't expect to ever be able to quit my job with it. It was just something again, to share my story, to bring back a hobby that I loved. I'm sure if you are a parent, you've had that time in your life where you maybe kind of questioned your identity or sort of lost yourself. And so at the time, my kids were both under two years old and one of them was obviously still nursing. And so I was really just looking for something fun, a fun outlet. And so I launched Thrifty guardian to share my budgeting expertise, to share my frugal living tips, my money making tips, hoping to just make enough to where I'd be able to feel better about leaving my kids crying at daycare every morning, about being having to work weekends sometimes, about being out of the house 12 hours a day. I thought maybe if I have this, it'll help me feel better. At least I'll be able to contribute a little bit more. Maybe we'll be able to hire a housekeeper so I don't have to spend so much time cleaning and just trying to find little ways to fit it in to where I no longer lived for just the weekends. Well, since then, it has transformed into where I run two sites. Now, of course I run Amberlozzi.com, which is the my services site through which I share my digital marketing expertise. And then of course, I still run Thriftyguardian to this day because guess what? Launched in November of 2015. By April of 2016, I gave my two weeks notice and I was done. And I walked away from my career in higher ed, the career that I thought I would have for my entire life. I did it all thanks to Thrifty Guardian, all thanks to blogging, and all thanks to smart marketing strategies that were implemented to save me time, but that were still effective. And so, again, that's what we're going to talk about today, is really implementing marketing strategies and building that strong foundation for automated marketing so that you see success quickly, but without that sacrifice that one might often mistakenly make by setting up these strategies inappropriately or not being strategic about how they do that. So these are my top tips. Tip number one. And this is something where if you've ever watched one of my videos, if you've ever worked with me, if you've ever pretty much heard words come out of my mouth, the first thing that I say when it comes to finding success marketing your blog is to always have an editorial calendar. And I say this even for my clients that aren't bloggers, it makes for an exceptionally amazing marketing tool. And so when you are looking at building that editorial calendar, you will consider the seasons, you'll consider what's going on, when obviously you want to identify your target market and think about their own personal timelines. If you're in the health and fitness industry, for example, then obviously January is going to be a big boom for you as people talk about their New Year's resolutions and wanting to live healthy. Or if you target moms, then right after the back to school craziness, that's when they're really able to sit down and take a breath and focus on whatever it might be reading your blog, or maybe signing up for your email list or even buying from you, ideally, right? Or clicking through those affiliate links. You need to think about the timeline. And so that is why my own personal opt in for my website is an editorial calendar tutorial, because it is essential. It is a game changer. If you've never used an editorial calendar before, now's the time to really sit down. Because I promise you that if you can be consistent with what it is you're putting out there, that's going to make all the difference in the kind of connection that you have with your audience, in terms of what they can expect from you, in terms of what they learn from you. All of that good stuff. You really want that consistency. You need that consistency if you're going to find success. Not only that, the tying us back to automated marketing, you have to know what you're building from, you have to know what you're springboarding from, right? You have to know what you're going to be talking about, when and we're going to touch a little bit more on that here in a second. But if you don't have a plan in place for what kind of content you're putting out with your blog, you're not going to be able to have a successful plan in place for automated marketing, for marketing it at all. You're not going to know what emails you want to be sending when, what you want to be putting out on your Facebook or what sort of images you might be wanting to put on Instagram. If you're using Pinterest, which as a blogger you should be, you need to have it in advance. You need to have that editorial calendar because you need to get pins out there two to three months in advance. Right now we're looking coming into February. If you are only just now writing a blog post about Valentine's Day and it's your first blog post about Valentine's Day and you're just now getting it out there, I'm sorry to tell you, but chances are good it's not going to pick up traction. That's not to say that next year it won't, but this year too little too late. So you need to be willing to plan ahead and again, that comes by having an editorial calendar next. You need to know when your money makers are, right? I said we were just going to touch on that a moment ago. You need to know what you are going to be pushing and when. And so like we talked about the editorial calendar in terms of the content you're pushing, this also comes into play again going back to, let's say you're in the health and fitness industry, right, and you've got an amazing affiliate partnership with Healthy Wage, which is a website that pays you to lose weight. If you know that people are going to be coming to your site looking for tips and tricks and ideas and blog posts about losing weight and motivation to stay on track and how do they stick to their New Year's resolution, you know that you're going to be wanting to push that affiliate link for Healthy Wage. You know that that is when you're going to be on point. That is when you need to maybe add a sidebar ad or make sure that your links are up to date or put it out on Facebook that they're running a special where now instead of a $50 incentive, it's $100 incentive. But again, if you're scrambling at the last minute, all of a sudden it's January 10 and you go, oh, why am I not pushing healthy wage right now? You've lost possibly hundreds, if not thousands of dollars that comes from not having that plan in place. Just like, let's say you are planning to launch your first e course three months from now, you should already be drafting out your marketing plans. Now you should already be thinking about what that's going to look like. A big part of my success early on and even now to this day is my e courses. I have automation education, which is a full course far, far deeper than this. 30 minutes training is on automated marketing and how to use the individual platforms. I have Pinterestential planning, which is my favorite course. If I'm going to pick favorites, play favorites on Pinterest and making the most of that, I've got clients who are seeing 15 plus million monthly views on Pinterest in due part to what they learned in that course. But I can tell you again, if I just threw it out there one day and said, hey guys, my cart's open. I've got this awesome new e course going on. Even if my copy is on point, even if you've been doing a decent job nurturing your email list kind of sorta, and you've been kind of hinting that something's coming up, you could have the most persuasive copy out there. But if you are just all of a sudden flying by the seat of your pants trying to launch this course, no marketing in place, just been really inconsistent with what you're putting out there, you're going to fall on your face and I certainly don't want that for you and you certainly don't want that for yourself. So you've got to know what it is you are going to be making money from and when. And I'm not kidding when I say that a couple of months ago as we were wrapping up 2019, I sat down for the entire year, right? I didn't do an editorial calendar for the entire year. That would probably make even me pull my brain and pull my hair out. But I sat down and noted what I was going to be promoting every single month. And if there was more than one thing that month, making sure that there wasn't any significant overlap, making sure I wasn't going to be pushing too much, you need to sit down and really just start drafting that out. And if you're new to blogging, right, you're sitting here going, amber, I haven't even made $10 for my blog. How am I supposed to know when my money makers are, you'll learn and you can most definitely set yourself some goals, get those ideas flowing. Think about your affiliate partnerships. Think about what digital products you might be wanting to put out there. Think about what your sales funnel might look like as they progress through that welcome series. You've got it set up for your email. Even if you haven't yet made much money or any money at all with your blog, you still know ideally, because you are so close to that blog, to that topic, what you're going to want to push when and again. This is something that can certainly grow and change, right? It's a living document. It's not something set in stone. But if you've got an idea as to what you're going to be pushing when, what kind of money you want to be making, when and how that again allows you that space to see when you're maybe going to be doing more nurture work, when you maybe need to step back and stop because you've been pushing sales. Sales. It really makes a big difference again, in the marketing strategy that you're going to be building, especially in terms of automated marketing, in terms of getting ahead with your scheduling again, both with your blog posts themselves, but with the content you're putting out on all of social media, on Pinterest, whatever the case may be. Next is to find a system that works for you, right? So it could be something as simple as an Excel sheet, right? Maybe you run an XML sitemap, pull all of your blog post links and just get them in a sheet. You can see there on my tabs, I've got all my blog posts and this is early on, okay, so this is more for you beginner bloggers, or maybe if you're neurotic like me a little, type A. This is what I used and I had all my blog posts listed. You can see down there, I had my referral links. This is back before I was really big into affiliate marketing. I didn't even know what affiliate marketing was. And so I just put referral links again very early on here. I kept note of my features. So if I was on a podcast or in an interview or did a guest post, made note of all of that. So that should someone want or should I decide to build a featured page on my blog, I don't have to go hunting all of that down. Just like if you have an affiliate link tab, if you're in a Facebook group that allows you to post affiliate links, like, let's say somebody asks a question about your favorite scheduling software, if you've got this in your Google Drive or your Dropbox can immediately open that document, grab your affiliate link, and post it in the comments. You don't have to go hunting for it. You don't have to try and jump on real quick and log in to share a sale or whatever the case may be. Rakuten. All those affiliate platforms, you just pull it. I've also got a Facebook group schedule, and that was when I was doing more of the day to day promoting within different Facebook groups that allowed it. So boost your blog. I might still be in. Honestly, I did promotion in my own groups. I run Pinterest Pals, and I used to have another entrepreneurial blogging group I'm even in. My favorite Facebook group, for example, is Boss Moms, which doesn't allow direct promotion. But again, back in the day, just having that reminder of what groups to check in on, I don't know, if you've been around long enough, you might remember Melissa Griffin's group. That was again, one of my favorites before she closed that down. And so it was just having those links there to where I could click through and not get distracted with the home feed. You don't get distracted with scrolling through and a picture of an otter. You can just click right into the group, focus in on engaging. Again, if the group allows it, you can promote yourself, whatever the case may be, but it keeps you very focused. And then I also have a tab there for hex codes because again, even now I do almost all of my own graphic design. But being able to pull those right colors right away, not having to do like a color dropper, try to figure it out or try to remember it from memory, that'll never happen again. I can just pull that document up and it's right there for you. And then of course, I had my Facebook business page. This was before scheduling was a thing in Facebook, so I used Hootsuite, and at one point I was using Buffer. But I would line it, lay it out, so that I knew again what I was pushing when. So that I wasn't trying to share two affiliate links in one week, or I wasn't just sharing blog post after blog post. Amount of content, making sure that you have a consistent but well placed schedule. Really, again, it makes such a big difference, not only because of what it is that you're putting out in front of your audience, but what it is that you're putting out via Facebook that keeps that algorithm happy, right? And then, of course, TG Facebook and LW Facebook. Those were for my separate Facebook pages that I was running. So if you are running more than one, really taking the time to map out the content for both is key to seeing success. Maybe the spreadsheet doesn't work for you, then maybe jump on Trello. I personally am not a huge fan of Trello, but maybe it works for you. That's something that I always stress when I'm doing trainings on automated marketing and talking about my own stories and sharing my own behind the scenes work. Just because I'm sitting here telling you, here's how I got from A to C. Here's how I found success. Here's my step by step. It doesn't matter, because if it doesn't work for you, if you're not comfortable with it, if you find it tedious or boring or overwhelming or whatever the case may be, you're going to stop using it, right? So even though I personally am not a big fan of Trello, I've got clients who love it, and so I accommodate them. I will make that work. And so try that out. Maybe that's something just like I talk about going back to Editorial calendars, maybe pen and paper isn't your thing. Maybe sitting out and writing out an actual calendar, you're like, no. Well, there's tons of different options in terms of software. There's a plugin literally called Editorial Calendar that is on WordPress. There's tons of different options out there. If you go into Google and type Editorial Calendar software, editorial Calendar plugin, you'll find a bunch of different options. But for me, again, coming back to what I do, I love pen and paper. There's definitely something to be said for the psychology of putting pen to paper in terms of memory mapping and all of that. Again, I'm old school. I've been doing this for so long. That's what I love. That's what I enjoy. I'm a writer by trade. I love pen to paper. It really helps me remember what it is I'm doing. But from there, again, I do plug it into my computer, whether that's scheduling out content or putting up a blog post or whatever the case may be, right? We live in this online community of bloggers, so eventually it does get on there. But again, it really is something where you might have to try one or two things to see what works best for you. But if you keep moving forward, if you keep trying and adjusting, when you feel something's working or when something's not, you'll see growth, you'll see success, and you'll be able to schedule out all the further with your automated marketing strategies. And then tip number four is please don't try to be everywhere at once, okay? And what I mean by that is that when you're thinking about your marketing strategy, you don't want to be thinking about what it is you're going to put on Facebook. And what it is you're going to put on. Twitter and what it is you're going to put on Instagram and what it is you're going to put on LinkedIn and Pinterest and maybe you're even trying to get on Snapchat and TikTok and, you know, everywhere you're gonna burn out. Most bloggers quit within the first three months of trying to find success because, well, I mean, I guess there's a lot of reasons, but part of it is because they want to be everywhere once, right? And they burn out. They think that they've got to be on all of these different platforms so that they're seen so that their content is seen, and that's not the case. Be strategic. Be where your target market is. For me, again, I love Facebook groups. That's where I first started networking as a blogger. That's still where I love to hang out now. It's where I find some of my clients and it's where I make, you know, my online friends. It's where I just, you know, get to know other bloggers and other colleagues. But for you, maybe you really like being on Twitter, or maybe you are more of a professional. Maybe you're sharing career building tips on your blog. Then maybe being on LinkedIn does make more sense for you. But if you're trying to be on ten different platforms all at once, I don't care if you are using Meet Edgar as your scheduling software, you're going to burn out. You're going to get tired. Your audience, especially if you're just copying and pasting and not really doing much in terms of repurposing your content, your audience is going to get burnt out. The algorithms are going to get burnt out. You're not going to see any sort of results. And again, I don't want that for you. I am here because I want you to be successful. I want you to live the life of your dreams and find your freedom through your blog, just as I did. So I'm not trying to just shout into the wind here. Trust me when I say that wherever you are at in this blogging journey of yours, I am here to celebrate you and I am here to cheer you on as you find your success. But you can't find it by throwing spaghetti at the wall and hoping it sticks. You can't find success through automated marketing or otherwise. If you are again trying to be on all of these different social media platforms and you're not consistent with what it is you're doing, you're not engaging with the people who actually do comment and like and share your stuff or you miss things, right? If you are scheduling stuff out, let's say you sit down and you schedule stuff out for the week and you've got it going out on all the different major social media platforms, and you're feeling good and you're like, oh, I'm doing what Amber told me. I am ahead of the game. Yay. And then you forget about it, right? You forget to check Twitter, and all of a sudden something of yours starts to blow up. And then it fizzles out because you forgot to open Twitter for three days because it's not a big deal to you, because it's not something you personally like to use. Wouldn't you be heartbroken? Like, I'm heartbroken for you just thinking about that. So please focus in on where your readers are and focus in on getting that platform with automated marketing strategies. Focus in on getting tactics in place for that platform and then branch out from there. I'm not saying you can't be using Twitter and LinkedIn and Instagram. If right now your audience is on Facebook, focus on Facebook first and then the rest will follow as they need to. That along those lines. Absolutely. I 1000% recommend that you schedule your posts in one sitting, and that goes for any platform, regardless. Maybe you're already doing really good with Facebook. You want to keep that rolling, but now you want to try Instagram. It's going to be a lot at first, right, as you're starting to think about going back to your editorial calendar and thinking about, okay, what sales am I going to be pushing? When are my money makers? And you're thinking about what sort of software you want to use. Doesn't matter what software you use, you have to sit down and actually use it. I personally like to do it on Sundays, right? Even now, here we are, four years into me being this work from home blogger and doing what I do. I still do work most weekends because I'm heavily involved in my kids schools. I do volunteer work with Habitat for Humanity and a couple of other local organizations. I like to live my best life, and that includes sometimes working weekends. And I love that I'm okay with that. And so for me, I sit down on Sundays and I look at what it is I've got coming up for the week, what it is I want to be pushing. Maybe it is a nurture sequence or maybe it is a sales sequence. And then you can either write out all of the copy at once going back to that Excel sheet, if you've got different images that you're going to be using, writing out those captions. Or personally I really like later for Instagram, especially because it's free, which is always nice. And I use Facebook schedule, of course, my schedule within Facebook. Facebook likes that we want to keep Facebook happy. And then I use tailwind for pinterest. And so I sit down and I schedule all of that out. And sometimes, depending on what's going on, it might take me 2 hours. But then I only have to spend ten minutes a day checking in on my posts and engaging with those who are engaging with me. Right? That's the end game is to get you to a place where, yes, you might have to batch out your work, and yes, at first you might be spending five, 6 hours, which at first seems overwhelming, right? But then you get that out of the way. And now the rest of the week can be a cake clock. The rest of the week you can just maybe while you're drinking your morning coffee, pop on Facebook real quick, see what's going on, engage with people, have encourage shares, or maybe you've got groups you can share in or even you're at lunch, maybe you're still working a nine to five, got a lunch break, great. Jump on your phone. Real quick engage. You don't have to worry about, oh, shoot, I meant to tell people that I'm going to be opening the cart to my course tomorrow, or oh, shocks, I meant to push an affiliate link today because they've got a major sale going on. By planning ahead and getting those automated marketing pieces into place, you don't have to worry about that. You can have the fun of engaging with people. You can have the fun. Ideally, you're passionate about your writing. You're passionate about what you're putting out there. Can have all the fun with that. And yes, again, it might be rough at first to sit down for those few hours and get that automated marketing stuff in place and get that scheduling out there, but once it's done, it's done. And that feeling of finally having it off your plate and being able to say, all right, my marketing is taken care of for the week or for the next two weeks, I wouldn't go beyond that. It's all a part of finding your freedom. It's all a part of being able to really, truly enjoy what it is you're building and enjoy blogging, right? Most of us, for the most part, didn't get into blogging because we like marketing, right? I'm an exception to the rule. I love marketing. It is something that I've always been passionate about. It's something that I've been recognized for my work nationally by United Way Worldwide. I've been recognized locally many times on different media platforms for it. But for you and for many other bloggers, most other bloggers, it's not about marketing. It's about writing. It's about sharing your value and your expertise and your love for your niche, for your topic. And so if you can kind of force yourself, if you will, to really sit down and batch out that marketing component and get it scheduled, get it automated, it will serve you all the better to where you're able to engage and get to talk to your audience and really enjoy building up that community that can be found through your blog. It also allows you to eliminate that mindless scrolling. We already talked about that a little bit. Goodness knows I'm guilty of it myself sometimes. We're all human. It happens. But if you aren't jumping on Facebook to just check your own page, right, you get Pages Manager on your phone. Maybe if you're actually getting on Facebook and you start scrolling and you're like, oh, I'll check my page, but this looks like a fun video, or oh shit, a baby, how fun. And suddenly 30 minutes have gone by and you meant to get a blog post out today, but now your kids want dinner and what to do right now, you got to stay up late or get up early in the morning. Just stay focused, keep to the plan, and focus on engaging throughout the week, right? Let your marketing plan run its course and just focus on building relationships with your readers. And then one last thing is that personally, especially when you're first starting off, I really recommend that you hone in on three Facebook communities that will really serve you well, and this will absolutely 1000% change over time. The only Facebook group that I am still in, that I was in when I first started this, again, going on over four years since I've launched Thrifty Guardian is Boss Moms. There have been probably a dozen other Facebook groups that have come and gone, whether it's because the admin closed them down or it no longer served me. Stick to three Facebook groups because you want to find that support, right? You want to find your advocates, you want to find your tribe, and you want to find your readers. And so when you're thinking about those three Facebook groups, definitely find ones that you can network in, that you can find your tribe, that you can enjoy being in, but make sure that at least one of them allows for a promotion of some sort. Now, I'm not saying it necessarily has to be direct promotion, right? Where you're spitting copy trying to get people to join your group program that you're running through your blog next month. Those can certainly work well if they are, well, moderated. But there's something to be said for groups that don't allow direct promotion, right, that only allow for promotion, maybe within somebody asks a question. Again, going back to what's your favorite scheduling software? Or does anybody have any great posts on potty training? Right? It's nice when you're able to put your links in there, but as I said earlier, going back to finding what serves you and what works best for you, that's where it's at is you need to look at those communities as actual communities, not as billboards to market yourself. Right? That's not what we're doing here. We're not just trying to spit our words pump copy everywhere and anywhere we can in the hopes that something sticks. You have to be strategic with your marketing efforts, especially if you want to automate it and get it off your plate and just have it running for a week. You need to be very strategic about it and you need to make it a non negotiable. That is one of my favorite things to say. It is one of my, like it's non negotiable. I don't even know. It is something where if you say something is non negotiable, it's like saying something is unacceptable, right? This is something that I learned with my English professor when I first started at college and she later became my advisor. The power of the word unacceptable or the power of the word non negotiable really will put a stop, put a pin in it, right? So if you tell yourself that it is a non negotiable to sit down and batch out your work and get your marketing plan in place, it is a non negotiable to sit down and get your editorial calendar done for this quarter. It is a non negotiable to be online at least ten minutes a day, not necessarily every single day, 365, because you need to give yourself some breaks. But it's a non negotiable. Four days a week, you're going to be on there engaging in those Facebook communities, engaging with people who are commenting on your stuff, engaging with those who are sharing your content. Non negotiable, meaning I don't care how tired you are, if you haven't gotten your non negotiables done for the day, you best drink some coffee and get it done. Because, trust me, as someone who has been doing this for two decades, somebody who has been in the blogging world for more of her life than not, if you want to find success, whether it's through automated marketing or through affiliate marketing or whatever you plan to do with your blog. If you want to find success, you have to be consistent, you have to have the will, and you have to be willing to say it's non negotiable. You have to be willing to recognize that some nights you might be staying up later than you meant to. Some nights or some mornings, you might be getting up way earlier than you ever wanted to. You're up before the sun. Trust me, when I was quitting looking to quit my nine to five again, my kids were both under two, one of whom was nursing. Meaning every 3 hours, I was either up nursing a baby or pumping. Yeah, I was exhausted. I was working weekends. I was barely sleeping. And did I border and burn out at one point? Absolutely. Recognize that. Step back and trust that you can make this happen. You are in this world. You have launched your blog. You are watching this summit because you are meant to find success and find your freedom through your blog. You just have to keep moving forward. You have to trust in yourself, and you have to make it a non negotiable that you are committed to bringing this blog to life, to finding that freedom, to making that money, to doing whatever it is you want to do with your blog. Whatever that freedom looks like, it makes no matter to me as an individual. But you are meant to better the world with your words. Trust in that and keep moving forward. And then, obviously, if you have any questions, please let me know. Or always, always feel free to reach out via email at ambertamerity. Just kidding. At Amber@thriftyguardian.com. I'm always happy to answer any questions you may have. I promise you, I'm not a pitch artist. I'm not a saleswoman. If you email me with a question, a genuine question, looking for help, whether it's on automated marketing or otherwise, I am going to answer you.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:38:49]:\
All right, Amber, thank you so much for sharing all that information. I took a ton of notes. I have a lot of action list items to do now. So any final words before we obviously ran to tell them about your freebie and stuff, but any final words of advice or anything?\
\
Amber Lozzi [00:39:05]:\
Again, it really does come down to recycling content in a strategic sort of way so that you are able to reuse that genius, that value that you're putting out there, but that it doesn't seem like you are recycling content to your audience. So always keep that in mind that you can recycle your content, you can post it on multiple platforms, but you need to do it in such a way to where your audience can't quite tell you're doing so.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:39:30]:\
Yeah, and that's the difference of quality. When you're producing quality content, you can make it turn it into a quantity game without absolutely.\
\
Amber Lozzi [00:39:40]:\
So awesome.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:39:41]:\
Everyone should definitely check out your freebie. She has this amazing freebie and post about helping you to create an editorial calendar. Because I think editorial calendars are clutch. You don't always have to follow them, but they're like the safety net of when you're not sure what to do next.\
\
Amber Lozzi [00:39:56]:\
In my mind, when you've got that blinking cursor staring at you absolutely. It's so helpful to have at least a list, if not an actual calendar of ideas to where that blinking cursor isn't causing you to paralyze with fear and not actually put out something. Yes.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:40:11]:\
So definitely check that out. And again, thank you so much for being part of the summit. I really appreciate it and you're very welcome. Yeah, we have all your links and stuff so people want to follow your social media. Check out her site. It's fantastic. Check out her I think we're going to have a little something for that in the All Access Pass. We'll be getting the details for that, but again, thank you so much.\
\
Amber Lozzi [00:40:32]:\
Thank you.\

[00:00:11.930] - Liz\
I'm really excited for this next session because I think it's something that I probably need to improve on as well. Our speaker has a Master's degree in counseling and education. She, at the beginning of her career, worked in social services as a crisis counselor and advocate for women who had suffered from sexual assault. She's decided to make the shift to teach and help other women to learn how to transform their lives through journaling. Her advocacy is that the written word is powerful and productive. So, through the use of journaling, she's led many to write books, start blogging, and just find healthier ways to implement self-care daily. I'm super excited to have Angela Clay on the call. Angela, thank you so much for agreeing to speak at the summit.\
\
[00:00:51.340] - Angela\
Thank you for having me. I'm so excited.\
\
[00:00:54.130] - Liz\
Yes. So, I mean we're going to be talking about journaling to help you create authentic content. What woul you say, like how would you define authentic content? Let's kind of go start there.\
\
[00:01:07.270] - Angela\
I think as creatives, we're all pretty unique, and you need to create it from their style, how they speak, their thought process. And I think that's authentic, just being your own single, as unique as your thumbprint. Right. And I find that once we tap into that part of ourselves, like we're able to bring that forth more, so that people can really see it.\
\
[00:01:29.710] - Liz\
Okay. Because I think in blogging, we always get so caught up in the SEO, you know. And what is the benefit of having authentic content, I guess, on your site.\
\
[00:01:43.070] - Angela\
There you go. Well, it makes you stand out. Most time, I find people have reached a certain status in their lives that they had these goals, and they finally reached them. They said that they had to pull back and pull away through layers. They had to know themselves inside and out. So, pretty much going inside, taking a seat with all the inner critic and all the things that plague us, maybe day to day, deal with that, and then they could go forward. And I think with blogging and all of that, whatever we do in life, that we have to sit down and really figure out, like, what do I want? Work through our own inner critic, and then we can move forward. And that authentic, when a person always tells me, tell me, when I really found out who I was by sitting down, working through trauma, working through my own inner critic, I started to find my authentic voice. And just personally, for myself, just going through that now and really seeing, like, tapping into who I am and how do I like things. Sometimes we look at other people and we're looking all around, and we get lost in that.\
\
[00:02:44.210] - Angela\
When we can really tap into who we are and what we want to give out in the world. That's where our strongest personality comes out. That's where our greatest gifts and creative spark comes alive.\
\
[00:02:56.070] - Liz\
Yeah. So, not every post needs to be SEO-focused. Like SEO can help people find you, but it's not going to help them connect with you. I think it's an important distinction.\
\
[00:03:06.300] - Angela\
Right. Clearly, someone could just actually stumble on your blog and then read something and like, oh, my goodness, this thing is the best thing. You know, slice bread, right? And they go on. They tell their friends, or, you got to check out this blog. It wasn't even SEO. They just happened to maybe did a keyword research on something else and scroll the page down and just happened to see your blog and said, oh, let me check this out.\
\
[00:03:26.930] - Angela\
And now let's something that because you hit their heart, they want to come back. You were different than all the other three, maybe above you in the search.\
\
[00:03:34.930] - Liz\
Yes. I mean, I once wrote a post, like, just literally just it was in my head. I wrote it. It sat there for years. I went back, I noticed I had it sitting in draft. I finished it. I hit published. It wasn't keyword research at all or anything, and it ended up someone contacted me, was like, hey, can we include this in our magazine? And I got, like, a ton of page views, you know, because it was relatable, and people connect to people, so keep that in mind. Okay, so now that we've kind of established what authentic content is and how it's beneficial, how can journaling help? Like what is the way to go about using journaling to help you do that?\
\
[00:04:18.050] - Angela\
Always. Fine. When I need to create a spark, I get in my car, I turn on the music, and sometimes I'll just drive. And I've noticed when I separate myself from the theme, I get the most creative ideas. And I think sometimes when we tap into journaling, we're not worried about if we're spelling something right or someone else's eyeballs and want to look at it and they want to critique it. It is just between you and the pages. And then that's where we can become very transparent and through journaling and just answering prompts, sometimes I'm like, whoa, this would be a cool blog to talk about. I should do a little bit more research around this, and how can this help someone else? I would have never thought of that if I hadn't let myself go amongst the pages and just be free to write and use a prompt to help me go to the left when I may have always keep going to the right, keep going to the, right. So, it allows me to find different ideas.\
\
[00:05:21.680] - Liz\
Okay, so let's let's kind of dive into the nitty gritty of that a little bit. So, are you journaling every day? Is it just when you've got a blog? What does that look like?\
\
[00:05:33.100] - Angela\
So, I've been journaling for 31 years, and I journal every day, multiple times a day. And when I sit there and I feel just in my head, I feel like, a lot of things are happening. Oh, God, I did a blog post. Oh, I do an email. I stopped, and I just sit, and I just start writing. And I'm just like, okay, sometimes I have to organize my idea. Sometimes I'm like, what is it about the blog post I feel like I want to write about? And I'll just write down some ideas, go back later. It's like my little research manual. I can go back and circle things that I felt would be a good topic to discuss, or I just maybe to get it out of my head to come back and revisit later. Sometimes when things start to plague us in our brains, we get stuck, and we can't move. And so, if we let it out on the pages, let it drip out of your head onto the page and let it hold your thoughts, you can always go back, and you won't forget.\
\
[00:06:24.890] - Liz\
Okay. Almost like brain dump, but like more regularly doing it. So, journaling doesn't necessarily have to be you sitting down and writing a whole story. Okay, so journaling can really be just sitting down to like get things out of your head on a regular basis. That's how we're defining.\
\
[00:06:41.410] - Angela\
Exactly, yes.\
\
[00:06:42.500] - Angela\
And you can have a small little notebook that you can just jot down some things. There's different styles of journaling. There's listing, there's, you know you can just sit down and just free. Right. And you can use guided prompts. And if you just have a few things that spark in your mind, you can pull out a small journal, something as small as this here. You can carry in your pocket, open it up, and pin on it. You know, so, yeah. It doesn't have to be something you have to sit down. And I think a lot of times, because journaling has become very popular and very mainstream right now, people feel like it has to be super ritualistic, and it doesn't have to. I feel like journaling, at certain points in my life, I just used it whenever I felt heavy on the heart or if I felt like I just needed time to write. I never made journaling feel like it has something that I have to do. When you turn it into something that you have to do, you end up not wanting to do it. How many times people tell you to do something, you're like, just because you told me to do it, I don't want to do it.\
\
[00:07:35.990] - Angela\
Right? You're like, I'm not doing it.\
\
[00:07:38.320] - Liz\
You have no idea how hard I relate to that.\
\
[00:07:42.770] - Angela\
When you told me to do it, and no, I don't want to do it. So, I think I don't want to tell people what you have to do. You have to do it at a certain time. You got to do it this way. No, I just think, just having it available.\
\
[00:07:54.530] - Liz\
Okay. It doesn't need to be pretty. I feel like there's so many, like, oh, bullet journal and stencils and all that stuff. Like, you don't need to do that for this.\
\
[00:08:02.570] - Angela\
No. And I think when you're writers, like, all of us, right, do not give me a whole bunch of pages with color and blocks, give me space, so I can write. And so, I think bullet journaling really causes for you to do a lot of design kind of things. And we're not here for it. We're just more here for, like, getting our words out. And I'm not knocking bullet journaling. It's fine. It's a time and place for that. But in this context of the conversation that we're having, you know we're trying to focus on getting things out of our heads, so we can initially, at the end, maybe help someone else.\
\
[00:08:37.670] - Liz\
Okay. I like that. Okay, so you've mentioned prompts a couple of times. Can you give us some examples? Can you give us ideas on where to find prompts? Are they prompts specifically related to blogging? Are they just, you know, I've never really used prompts before, so I'm curious.\
\
[00:08:53.370] - Angela\
So, there's different styles of prompts. Prompts [inaudible 00:08:56] two words like safe harbor. So, what do you hear when you hear safe harbor? It could be literally like, taking you back to the time when you read the harbor with your family, remember being at a pier or whatever. It could just spark anything. It could become emotional. When you feel like you need to go to a safe harbor emotionally, and your friends are your safe harbor, your family is your safe harbor. So, you can utilize that. But some things may have come up for you that you may never have thought of if you hadn't had that phrase safe harbor. And then another prompt could be more of a guided prompt, like, is it hard for you to forgive? Why so? And you can discuss, like, okay, why it's hard for me to forgive, and this is why I feel this way. So, then it goes in that way. I feel like the two prompt kind of journaling prompt, it just lets you free flow and go, let your mind dip and dabble in different spaces. And then more of a guided journaling prompt just really wants you to pinpoint on a topic.\
\
[00:10:00.990] - Liz\
Okay, so when you're doing, you know, those prompts, because those prompts, especially aren't necessarily blogging related, so how do you look at kind of what you wrote from them to tie it into, okay, what's tied to your blog or creating content? How do you kind of go about filtering out what to do?\
\
[00:10:24.010] - Angela\
So, I think once you get everything down on paper, then you can go back and you can slide in and see if anything relatable about, what you're talking about. How can you make this relatable to your market? You know I think as writers were very crafty and very savvy at taking something and taking a spin on it. And a lot of times, sometimes we just have blocks because personally, we have things that's inside of us that we need to get out. Once that's out, then perhaps something that has nothing to do with what you've written on the page is what you need to put in your blog, but it, you know, unveiled something else that you just couldn't get past because you were over here thinking about this thing.\
\
[00:11:05.830] - Liz\
Yeah, I like it. Okay. One thing I wanted to ask is, I know you said you journal multiple times a day. How long are you journaling for? Like, what is, you know, I feel like a lot of people, they hear journaling and they're like, oh, my gosh, it's got to be pretty. It's got to be like these gorgeous writing. You know, I need to sit down for 30 minutes and write down everything. It sounds like, you know, I know I've been guilty of thinking those things, but that's not necessarily true. So, kind of how long, you know, does it I mean, obviously it's going to vary, I think, but what would you say is the bare minimum to journal?\
\
[00:11:41.720] - Angela\
You know what? It could be a sentence, I think, about the haiku poetry. I mean, it could be a sentence, and it hits you so powerfully. You're like, and you're sitting there pondering on that one sentence or those four words that someone said in that piece of writing. So, I feel, like I said before, making it ritualistic, it doesn't help. Because when you're forced to do something, you're not in your authentic space, and so it doesn't come out as genuine as it should. So, simply just sitting down, if you have a few things you want to say, jot it down for two minutes. It's fine. I like journaling because it's non-judgmental. It doesn't hold you accountable for anything. It's just like, hey, I'm a blank page. I'm here to hold space for you. If you want to pick up the pen and you want to write, I'm here. If you don't, I'll be here when you're ready.\
\
[00:12:35.010] - Liz\
I like that. I like that a lot. Okay, so what are some mistakes you see people making when it comes to journaling in general, but also journaling to kind of help them, you know, figure out content?\
\
[00:12:48.070] - Angela\
At the end of the day, I feel like journaling is almost like going to the gym. You know, youhave to go to the gym if you want that Beyonce six pack. You want that body, you have to go to the gym. You just can't be like, I want it, and then not. So, sometimes for people, if journaling is something that you want to dabble in, you feel like it just really isn't working for you. It isn't working, and it's fine, I think, a lot of times because it's a hot topic and you go into different places and people like journal, journal, journal, maybe it's just not your thing and it's okay to feel like that. There's so many different tools that we can use to utilize to help us to stay in our creative space. Journaling is just one that you can add to your tool belt. And if it doesn't feel if it feels like every time you try to write, it feels like it's pushing and you're, like, rolling your eyes. We're not here to build businesses and blocks to wake up and roll our eyes and be all, you know. Just stop.\
\
[00:13:47.530] - Liz\
Yes, I like it. You are doing this to create the life you want, not another one that you're like, waiting for the weekend on.\
\
[00:13:55.850] - Angela\
Exactly.\
\
[00:13:57.050] - Liz\
Okay. So, I like the sort of non-judgmental approach to journaling. Is there anything that you see people do that we've covered that doesn't need to be ritualistic, but tips to make it more of something you go to for that tool in your toolbox? I feel like it's easy to forget what you have available to you. What are some tips you have to make sure that that's something that's always somewhat front of mind, if not taking up a lot of your mind?\
\
[00:14:30.070] - Angela\
So, I'm really big in self-care, and I feel a lot of times with self-care, it's always something that we have put on our schedule, like, two weeks down the road. Self-care is something that I feel, especially after we all survived a pandemic, that's something to implement daily. So, when you're implementing your tools for self-care, maybe if it's twice a week or sometime throughout the day when you stop to reset, you just have it really handy, and then you can pick it up and you can write. I just think with journaling, it's just really convenient. I have a journal that is, if it's right in my bag. And so whenever I put, the move hits me to write. I can just go in my bag and pull it out. And so, I just feel like making that convenient. Even if it's just a small pocket size journal, it's just right there, so that, oh, I have an idea. Back pocket and write. I like writing because it helps, you know, our brain to kind of slow down and we kind of get in a rhythm. But if you like, hey, I'm totally electronic, and I like to do everything on my phone.\
\
[00:15:32.430] - Angela\
You can pull out a blank doc, and then you can just type right there.\
\
[00:15:37.770] - Liz\
Okay, you hit on there because I was just about to ask that, and I think you also hit on the thing of, like, we're talking about drilling for authentic content, but it ties into self care. And if you're not taking care of yourself as a blog, because it's so easy to overwork yourself, there's always something to do. There's always the hustle, which you know, I'm not like, hustle all the time, but especially, I think, when you're newer. Yeah, you got to put in those hours sometimes. But it's really important to take a step back. And if you're using journaling as a tool for blogging, it can also tie into a tool taking care of yourself. I think you kind of hit on that really well. Okay, so any final tips for people who, you know, kind of maybe struggle with this or the idea of using journaling.\
\
[00:16:27.850] - Angela\
You know, I'm a freestyle journalist, so you just give me a blank piece of paper, you give me a pen, and I can write. I can write for like, hours if you put me in a room, I will just write and I will write and I will write. I never leave a full page ever halfway. So, if you're the type of person that is like, oh, my goodness, that's overwhelming. Right? There are so many different types of journals on the market that are like, just guided prompts. I even have little cards that I have that I made up that just have different two words on it. That you can just jot it down. So, there's tools where you don't have to be that freestyle. Like, you know, give me a mic and I can go, right, give me a pen and paper. And you're like, well, that's too overwhelming. So, there are guided journals that will just help you just write based on the prompt and the question, and you just go for it, so.\
\
[00:17:19.230] - Liz\
Okay. And I know you've got some resources for our attendees. You want to tell us about those?\
\
[00:17:25.790] - Angela\
Sure. So, I created a journal. It's called my Authentic Thoughts and Ideas. And so, it's a journal for bloggers, so you can buy out the time to reflect and journey within. And I found that when I sit at someone else's table, another writer that has a journal, and I answer a question. Man, when I start writing, I'm thinking, oh, that's a good blog, that's a good blog idea, because I stopped taking from my own buffet and I went somewhere else and I was fed differently, and it helped me generate a new idea. And so, this journal just asks you some questions, and it has nothing to do with blogging, but it's just to help you reset. And towards the end of it, you'll see that I bring it back to like, okay, you know, journaling and bloggin. But sometimes we just have to just stop and be creative in a different way that we normally wouldn't.\
\
[00:18:20.370] - Liz\
Yeah. And I think that reset will help to clear the slate, really. It just, you know when you've got so much on your plate, it's hard to really focus on any one thing. So, definitely, go check that out. Angela, thank you so much for sharing your knowledge. I've definitely got a new perspective on journaling now, and I'm going to implement it some more. So, thank you.\
\
[00:18:41.910] - Angela\
Yes, thank you for having me.\

Liz Stapleton [00:00:12]:\
Alright, guys. I'm super excited to have a returning speaker today. She is a verified expert when it comes to Canva, and she's from Canada. I'm super excited that she's here to join us today, to share things about Canva organization because I know I always struggle to keep my Canva account organized. She helps lots of entrepreneurs figure this out to use Canva more effectively and efficiently, and she loves to help them tame the hot mess Canva accounts, which I am very familiar with. A big warm welcome to Brenda Cadman. Brenda, thank you so much for coming back.\
\
Brenda Cadman [00:00:43]:\
Oh, thanks for inviting me. I I was happy to do it.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:00:47]:\
Yeah. So, and I know last year's session or I think it was last year when you shared about Canva organization, I learned a lot, and I got my Canva organized, and it wasn't such a hot mess. But, like, a year later, it's a hot mess again because I wasn't maintaining it. And plus Canva's just tweak things a little where it's like, wait a second. And part of part of that is is me not paying attention. That's the Canva..... I know. So I was hoping we can maybe discuss kind of if you at one point did get organized, how do you reset when you become disorganized?\
\
Brenda Cadman [00:01:25]:\
I it's a really important thing to do because even if you have maintained it maintained it, periodically, things shift in our businesses where it requires more than a a little bit of maintenance. It requires a total facelift, in terms of the structure that you have. And we can usually get a sense of when things are no longer quite as easy to put things away because suddenly it it feels like you're feeling a bit of friction there about where where does this go? I I don't even really need to keep this anymore, but I might need it. And, so I do think that periodically, you know, on a maybe an annual basis, it's worth reevaluating. Is my business the same? Am I doing the same thing? Am I working with the same kinds of clients? Is what I have right now still feeling fairly intuitive in terms of filing stuff away? And if it is, great. I'm not saying you have to change things. Yeah. But you need to you need to have that, a little bit of of awareness to determine, do I need to make some bigger changes here and carve some time out to do that? But in terms of just regular usage of it, I would say even if it's not time for that deep clean, if you're feeling, if that if you're falling behind in terms of staying on top of organizing your files, if it's just because you're not able to carve out the time to do it and it's about establishing a new habit, especially like you said, the layout has the interface has changed a little bit, and while functionally, it's not all that different, the packaging is different enough that it's there's a bit of a learning curve there again.\
\
Brenda Cadman [00:02:56]:\
Sure. So the reason you're not feeling organized and it's kind of delving into hot mess territory again is because it just is hard to carve the time out. That's one issue. But if you're finding it's hard to stay on top of the organization because there's no clear home for your files if every time you're going to file something away, it's like, I don't really know where this goes, but I feel like I have to put it away.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:03:41]:\
Yeah.\
\
Brenda Cadman [00:03:41]:\
Then you do need to sit down and really reassess whether or not the structure you have works for you. I have found there's a lot of content that kind of maybe comes across my feed more than others because this is an area I'm really interested in. But I'll see content creators saying, here are the 5 folders everybody must have on Canva to organize their designs.\
\
Brenda Cadman [00:03:42]:\
Yeah. And it that's not true because there is no one size fits all solution. And if you try to use somebody else's organization structure to impose on your designs, it's not necessarily going to work. So it might feel like you've started to get organized, but it's really hard to finish that process or stay on top of it because it's just not the right folder structure. It's not a quick fix, but you have to evaluate whether you've got the right folders.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:04:09]:\
So I think that is a big area that, like, my folder structure is just there's too many subfolders. There's too like, I just I forget where things I forget the folders I have. So if I need to clean up my folders, especially downsizing where I just have less folders and more general folders in a sense, What is the easiest way to do is there an easy way to do that?\
\
Brenda Cadman [00:04:28]:\
There's not necessarily an easy way. It really depends on how much content you have. If you have a small amount of content, then this is gonna be a faster process. But I would hazard to guess that you and most of the people watching this, it it's a lot of designs. It's a lot of images and brand assets that need to to have some sort of organization put to it. And you don't want to necessarily get rid of too many of your subfolders. You you do want to it's that balance between having enough detailed folders but not getting too granular because then all of a sudden you might have a folder that has 1 or 2 things in it, and it's just not necessary. But you also don't wanna have a folder that has a 100 things in it because then you're scrolling through it, still trying to find the thing that you're looking for, which falls into that same wasted time kind of category that you're gonna you're gonna find yourself in if you're using, Canva's homepage, which is just useless, really, as far as organization goes.\
\
Brenda Cadman [00:05:26]:\
So sitting down, I think the first there's a little bit of going back to the drawing board and and reviewing what am I actually creating. Am I working with clients? What sort of designs am I creating? I know bloggers may have a client base as well, or if they're strictly doing, blogging, they might have folders for social media. And, you might have a photos folder if you are if you listened to my tips last year, not using the uploads folder for for organizing your images. But I do think you need to start by reassessing what am I actually organizing and then try to figure out what are the big chunks and then what are some of these smaller chunks underneath that? If you are finding if you're finding it difficult to find the files because there's just too many subfolders, there's no shame in moving everything into a a a higher level folder, getting rid of all the subfolders, and reassessing what those subfolders should be. And sometimes, you know, they gotta pull everything out of the closet before you can put the organization into it so that it it's it's gonna get kind of messy, even messier before it can get better. And people are very resistant to that feeling because it feels like it's getting worse rather than getting better, but sometimes you gotta pull everything out in order to see what you've got. Purge what doesn't need to be there. That's often there's often a lot of old stuff that we're afraid to let it go up, and maybe you'll be ready to hit delete now, and then reassess what that folder structure should actually look like.\
\
Brenda Cadman [00:06:55]:\
So it's going back to the drawing board, but the second time around, you might have a probably a better sense of what what kind of folders you're actually gonna need.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:07:04]:\
And use. Because I thought I used all these folders, but then it turns out that I don't actually use them.\
\
Brenda Cadman [00:07:10]:\
Yeah. You don't I I think it's tempting to create folders, anticipating how future you is actually going to use them and then future you comes around and realizes not actually gonna stick those files there, that's fine. There there's no you're not gonna get it perfect. There is no perfect in terms of creating an organization system. It is always going to change to suit your needs and the new kinds of content that you're creating. So don't resist that. I mean, feel free to, I don't need that folder anymore. Delete that.\
\
Brenda Cadman [00:07:39]:\
Create a new one, and it's going to change over time. And there's nothing wrong with that. At the end of the day, if you can find what you're looking for in an easy and quick manner, regardless of what that structure looks like, it's doing its job. But if you're feeling fresh any sort of friction, you need to reassess.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:07:58]:\
Okay. I like that. And you should be able to bulk organize your files fairly easily in Canva. Assuming you have a pro account and you're doing multiple folders because, otherwise, this isn't a thing for you.\
\
Brenda Cadman [00:08:09]:\
Yeah. Yeah. I there's no, like, select all Yeah. Kind of feature, but you can click and drag. You can select multiple, and you can you can, click and drag to select multiple Okay. Which is gonna make it a lot faster to be able to then click on that little folder icon and move it into another folder.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:08:28]:\
Okay. Yeah. I like that. Another area that I find gets cluttered, because, honestly, I'm not quite sure how it gets set up, is the sidebar when you're in a design because you've got it always starts out with, like, design, elements, text, brand, you know, those basics. But then you have a bunch of other stuff on there, which you can use, but somebody I'm like, why is that there? How did that get there? So how how does stuff end up there? I guess, is my first question. My next question is how often should you clean it out? And\
\
Brenda Cadman [00:08:59]:\
So this is this is actually in the editor itself in that object.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:09:03]:\
I can share my screen if you want me to show you You\
\
Brenda Cadman [00:09:04]:\
know what? Why don't we why don't we do a screen share? Because I I can envision it, but I know not everybody's in there Yeah. Yeah. Every day, all day.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:09:13]:\
Okay. So can you see my screen? Okay. So I just opened up a random design. But so I have Yes. Here's this stuff. But then there's so much more stuff, and I don't even and also, like, my I don't think my logos are even in the right place, if I'm being honest. Yeah. Oh, no.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:09:31]:\
They are there. Well no. But now it says go to brand see, I'm confused.\
\
Brenda Cadman [00:09:34]:\
Yeah. These are so all of these have been opened at one point, and you haven't gotten rid of them. So they have just remained there. So I would recommend doing a full on purge of this. I'll tell you personally. Again, there's no one size fits all response. How I work is not necessarily what will work for other people. But I clear that out on the regular where the default ones are the only ones showing at just so because I like a nice clean surface, and you can get rid of them by hovering.\
\
Brenda Cadman [00:10:01]:\
If you hover over them. Uh-huh. You and you should see it. There should be an x that shows up. Now if you click on just click on it. There you go. So you have to go through each of them, click on it, select it, and hit the x and x all of them out. So what you're seeing down at the bottom is I'm seeing a a collection here of old apps that maybe would have opened opened at one point.\
\
Brenda Cadman [00:10:23]:\
I'm seeing a whole lot of custom folders. And once you have opened the custom folder, it kinda stays there pinned so you can access it. Okay. But if you don't stay on top of that, you're gonna have a whole you know, it it's it's basically the Canva equivalent of a browser with 3 bazillion tabs open. So\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:10:42]:\
Okay. So that's Oh, I recognize that. But you're saying as soon as I, like, open something, if I go to, like, my is it projects and I open a file or folder?\
\
Brenda Cadman [00:10:52]:\
If you open one of your folders there, it's gonna append it there.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:10:56]:\
So does this show up there now?\
\
Brenda Cadman [00:10:57]:\
Probably probably down at the where if you've opened it before Way down. Okay. Way down at the bottom. So I would clear those out. You don't have to do that all the time. I don't do that every single time that I work in Canva, but that is something that I try to stay on top of. Now I have the added, motivation in that I do record Canva tutorials on a regular basis, and I don't want everybody seeing all my business. So I do\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:11:23]:\
Sure. Have to\
\
Brenda Cadman [00:11:23]:\
clean that\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:11:24]:\
out regularly. Okay.\
\
Brenda Cadman [00:11:25]:\
But it it's nice to just have that as a clear space as well so that if I do open a folder and I wanna be able to easily find it, that I'm not scrolling and scrolling.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:11:34]:\
Yeah. So then yeah. I'm like, wait a second. Where'd it go? Because it does get really long. And I was like, how did they even end up here? So okay. Yeah. I would I would\
\
Brenda Cadman [00:11:42]:\
get rid of everything down to, apps there. So so or keep everything from the top to apps, and then everything below that is something that it's opened because you engage with it.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:11:54]:\
Okay. Okay. Wow. Yeah. Okay. Now that makes sense. I was just like, when I was because, like, I tend to I'm not in Canva all the time. Like, I it's very, like,\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:12:10]:\
spurts\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:12:11]:\
of I'm in a lot for a little while, and then I'm not in it at all for a while. So that's alright. Okay. Alrighty. So another thing I've kinda noticed I would love to get kind of your thoughts on is for the longest time, I would just you know, I'd go to share. I'd go to download. I'd download it to my computer, whatever folder what not. And I've recently and it would download a zip folder if it was multiple things.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:12:38]:\
Right? And then you had to open the zip and whatever. Yep. So I've recently played around with downloading directly to Dropbox, which does not result in a zip file. But then if I actually wanna open it on my computer, it's gotta like, it takes a second because it's like, I can't just move it from my Dropbox to something because I have to have actually opened it on my computer. So I'm curious kind of what your thoughts are on the various different save options and, you know, make sure that stays organized as well because there's this has this has expanded quite a lot in the over the years.\
\
Brenda Cadman [00:13:11]:\
So It has.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:13:13]:\
Thoughts, advice, tips.\
\
Brenda Cadman [00:13:16]:\
I I'm a big I'm a big fan of just sticking with the basics. There's every possible option and integration there, and they they wanna be able to provide that if you need it. But the, really, the only features that I'm using as far as sharing and downloading is I'm doing a straight download to my computer. And then as soon as I'm done with it, I'm trying to clear up that downloads folder on a regular basis. I mean, we have all these different collection buckets, whether it's in your email or on your computer or in your Dropbox or in your Google Drive or in Canva. And and it's it I do think there's a lot of value in just carving out on your calendars a dedicated half hour once a week to just do cleanup, just to clear the things out, either file it away if you are gonna need it again. But a lot of the stuff we're downloading from Canva, we just need it temporarily for uploading to social media or to add as a featured image to a blog post, and we don't need to hang on to it on the computer. So staying on top of clearing it out of wherever we've downloaded it to is is an important part.\
\
Brenda Cadman [00:14:20]:\
But, honestly, I whether I'm pretty much only downloading them, occasionally, I'm sharing it, say, saving it as a brand template or I'm grabbing a template link to share the file directly as a Canva template. But I don't tend to save it into other, other programs. There is some value if you have a lot of content and you're wanting to maybe share or save copies into Dropbox or some other, storage system that you've got an integration with. But I think a typical user just needs to for the most part, they're downloading it whether it's a PDF or, it as a PNG or JPEG file. They use it, and then they're done with it. And they just need to delete it and then know that the original is here, so they need to come back and get it. Because, well, otherwise, what happens is you download it. You end up making changes to the file in Canva, then you download it again, and then you have this collection of multiple versions.\
\
Brenda Cadman [00:15:14]:\
You don't know which is which. I mean, you can go by the edited date, but it it just ends up piling up as they download it, use it, and get it out of there.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:15:25]:\
Okay. And I just wanna confirm, this saved the folders to your Canva folders. So this this is where Yeah. You could organize things from inside the design if you want.\
\
Brenda Cadman [00:15:35]:\
You you can. But, honestly, what I find easier is what's more intuitive is just go back to the projects page, refresh it when you've been working, and then anything that's appearing, I would and the first thing you actually should do, if you go back if you scroll back to the top, there's filters at the top here and where it says owner. Mhmm. Change that to just show yours because, otherwise, how project works is a little it's not as intuitive as it should be. And I do believe we're gonna see some improvements on this and, you know, in the next in the coming months. But this what happens is if you have owner selected often, you will have things filed away, but they won't actually file away into the folder. It kind of surfaces up these old files. It's also acting more like a search function than than a filing system.\
\
Brenda Cadman [00:16:26]:\
If you change it to show your your actual account name, then and the designs that appear under, on this page under designs, these are things that need to be foldered. These are things that need to be put away. So I often get asked, how do I know what I haven't put into a folder? You go to your projects page. You look what's under designs.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:16:48]:\
Mhmm. What's under your folder if it's actually in a folder. Right?\
\
Brenda Cadman [00:16:51]:\
If if it's already in the folder, you won't see it as a loose individual title on there. You'll it'll be in the folder already. So all of these things here, if it's not in the folder, all of the individual designs on this page, those all need to be, those all need to be put into folders. Yeah. Yeah. Delete it or archive. There is no judgment there. That is just how to identify them.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:17:17]:\
I mentioned it became a big mess again. Are you like?\
\
Brenda Cadman [00:17:21]:\
But I'm in work with you because there's a lot of stuff here. You know what? And it could be a simple you know, if you're like, okay. I know I need to organize this stuff. I don't have the time to deal with it right now. I just wanna have a nice clean surface. There's nothing wrong with doing a drag and select and moving all of this into a, you know, to be organized folder or a temporary folder. Yeah. So you can at least get some sort of clear surface moving forward and then tackle it in smaller chunks.\
\
Brenda Cadman [00:17:48]:\
And part of that tackling and maybe going through and saying, I don't need any of these than just deleting them and getting them out of there because there's no point filing stuff that you don't need.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:17:57]:\
Yeah. Okay. No. I like that.\
\
Brenda Cadman [00:18:01]:\
Alrighty.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:18:04]:\
Any other tips? Because I know so we talked about this, how the, the way Canva looks has changed a lot lately. The layout's the same thing. But stylistically, it looks different. Any tips It does. And there is\
\
Brenda Cadman [00:18:18]:\
yeah. And there's one new thing here. This this starred section here on the left hand side\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:18:27]:\
Don't know what I that you\
\
Brenda Cadman [00:18:28]:\
you So you you have starred some of your folders and which is not a bad thing And I'll tell you how I'm using this personally right now because one of the things I've got done away with, not even I believe it was before the glow up interface rolled out. There used to be kind your your file hierarchy where you could see all of your folders on the left hand side. You could pull the file into it. That got removed, I think, as an experiment, and I'm hoping that'll be fixed. But in the meantime, I'm using this star feature to be able to kinda create half my own sort of file structure there. So I have I have, 12 or 13 top level folders, and I have starred all of those so that they appear under your star so that if I'm working, you know, on, if I'm just navigating around, it's easier for me to jump back into the folders without having go to go back to the main projects page. Now you can you can move them from here.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:19:30]:\
That makes it easier to be like, well, okay. Let me at least get in the top level and out of the way.\
\
Brenda Cadman [00:19:35]:\
Exactly. At least there's some steps towards that. And then, additionally, when this was first rolled out under your star, you couldn't reorder them, so you'd have to really strategically star them in so they'd appear in the order. But now you can Okay. You can drag the order. And if you click on the little plus sign next to your starred, you can also create a section that you can hold starred items. So maybe you have multiple folders you're working on for clients that you wanna be able to access. You can reorder those as well.\
\
Brenda Cadman [00:20:03]:\
I personally, so like I said, I have all my top level folders starred. And then at the top, I have a section that is kind of a time sensitive area. So I'm working on a lot of affiliate graphics for Black Friday right now. I'm working on my own affiliate Our Black Friday content. So I've got a little Black Friday section at the top. And then when I'm done with that, I'll remove this section out of your star because I don't need it anymore. But the top level folders, I still keep there for my just ease of access. It's more like it's more like bookmarking.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:20:35]:\
Yeah.\
\
Brenda Cadman [00:20:35]:\
Or favoriting than it is, anything else. It's a step I think we'll see improvements here, but for now, this is what you're working with.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:20:48]:\
Yeah. Alright. Any other sort of tips or, you know, if things you've seen people struggle with with the kind of new look that, you know, has helped them to kinda get used to it or use it? I\
\
Brenda Cadman [00:20:59]:\
mean, the reality is that most of nothing that it pertains to organization. I think there's there's 2 you have to figure out there's 2 2 different kinds of concerns that come out of the glow up interface. One is this looks different. It's uncomfortable. Things have moved around, and it takes time to get used to it. Now I've I've had the benefit of additional time to get used to this because I've had it since early May before it was rolled out even in its earliest form.\
\
Brenda Cadman [00:21:33]:\
So I've had months to get used to it, and it really is second nature to me now since I'm also in here every damn day. But so the part of it is, okay, how much of this is the learning curve and it I will get used to it. And how much is they changed something? It has slowed things down. It is it is negatively impacted my workflow because of the changes that they have made. Those are the items you need to tell Canva, and you will see in the lower left corner of your screen, there's a little glow up icon there. If you click on it, there's an option there to submit feedback. They are paying attention to that. I know it feels sometimes like you're screaming into the void when there are changes that you don't like, but I promise they are.\
\
Brenda Cadman [00:22:14]:\
It doesn't mean that they will necessarily change everything that you want to see changed. But if you see a problem, tell them tell them specifically where the problem what problems you're encountering and how it is negatively impacting what you're trying to do. There's a lot of people who are just saying, I don't like it. Change it back. Well, can Canva can't do anything with that. They're not going to, but they can refine features. That also doesn't tell them what specifically you don't like. And, you know, if if we're creating\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:22:46]:\
Period. Like, that they're not gonna they're not gonna just change it back. I remember when we had to shift to Canva 2.0. That was rough because your design studio\
\
Brenda Cadman [00:22:57]:\
Exactly. You had, like, completely ridiculous. That was a big change. But we get used we we we don't like change, and then we adapt. But I admit I will be the first to say there are things that change that got rolled out as part of this interface change that were not great in terms of it really felt clunky and slowed things down. Like, opening like, the editing panel started to open on the right side of the the screen instead. So if you were changing colors or fonts, it was that panels opening on the the right. There was a lot of pushback and a lot of people saying, please put it back on the left.\
\
Brenda Cadman [00:23:30]:\
That's what we're used to. That's what works for our work flow and explain how it was slowing it down. And to their credit, they very quickly change that back, but they need to have that specific actionable feedback. If if we just say to somebody, I don't like it, I'll know I I like you know? Yeah. I'll I'll I'll know what I like when I see it. There's nothing they can do with that. Yeah. So\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:23:54]:\
is there any Yeah. Is there anything that you can kind of customize within this workspace for yourself to make it easier? I'm just if I'm just curious. I don't know that there is. But beyond your star No.\
\
Brenda Cadman [00:24:06]:\
Beyond the start and, you know, just creating those creating those folders is just incredibly important. The stay off the I would really strongly advise stay off the home page version of that home landing tab because it's all the most recent files. There's nothing it's just pure overwhelm,\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:24:24]:\
which I do feel better than what they used to have where it was, like, all the different things you can make.\
\
Brenda Cadman [00:24:29]:\
It was it was, like, more detail add to it. It is better. This is better. It's in-depth now. It's just all these quick start, options and then all your files. But if you're looking for something specific, unless it's one of the last couple of designs that you've been working on, it still becomes very overwhelming. So I would say get into a habit of going to the project section as your default and working from there. Because once you just have a set of a simple set of folders I don't know.\
\
Brenda Cadman [00:24:58]:\
Is there any benefit in seeing what I've got in terms of,\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:25:02]:\
Yeah.\
\
Brenda Cadman [00:25:02]:\
Sure. Let me actually If you want to give me sharing, I will, Yep.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:25:08]:\
Alright. I think you should have it now.\
\
Brenda Cadman [00:25:12]:\
Okay. And I will refresh that. I will share my screen. Just\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:25:17]:\
You can see what a professional organized Canva looks fine.\
\
Brenda Cadman [00:25:22]:\
So you can see how I've got all my top level folders are all you starred over here, and then I've got Black Friday, which is a section I'm working on up here. Those, and that's just time sensitive, and I'll delete that when I'm done with it. But this is all that I have on projects. There's no loose designs or images or videos here because they're all in folders. But you'll see if I again, if I change it, it it goes to any owner that's going to change. Suddenly, you're gonna have a lot of stuff that gets burped up here from sometimes the distant past. Mhmm. So you do wanna make sure that if you are a solo, Canva user that you are, just just change that to show your own file, and then it'll stay nice and neatly filed away.\
\
Brenda Cadman [00:26:07]:\
But by coming here as my starting point, if I'm looking for something you know, if if I'm looking for the last couple of things I worked on, I'll just grab it from the carousel at the top. But if I am looking for a presentation design or something else that I created some time ago, I'm gonna immediately be able to start drilling down from that top level. And then you can see I've got subfolders for presentations for me. It makes sense to break it down, on a time basis. Whereas if I'm, you know, looking for courses, those are broken down by the course name or the course or the function. So if this is what works for me and what works for somebody else will be totally different, and that's okay. There is no one size. It's all solution.\
\
Brenda Cadman [00:26:52]:\
But I would encourage you to go through and get to the point where you just have these folders at the top. It feels manageable. You don't wanna have 40 different folders at the top here, or you're, again, still gonna be scrolling through trying to find what you're looking for. You'd wanna minimize the number of choices. And a good way of thinking about it could be, like, a bit like, navigating a website. If you're looking at a website, you don't have if you have 3 gazillion options in your website navigation, it's hard to find anything because it's just sheer overwhelm. But if you have these kind of top level categories that are descriptive enough that you know what you're gonna find, but they're general enough that allows for you to expand content underneath them, then that's kind of the sweet spot that you're looking for. And I'd be fine about 12 to 13 is good.\
\
Brenda Cadman [00:27:37]:\
And you can see if I had too many more, I would start to have to scroll in order to see them in the starting section.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:27:43]:\
Got it. I like that. Alright. Thank you so much for sharing that. Okay. So I think we're about out of time. I know you have some excellent, resources and stuff for attendees. If you can just share a little bit about that.\
\
Brenda Cadman [00:27:57]:\
Sure. So, I have the Canva organization road map, which started out as kind of a PDF guide. And I I think there's a tendency, and I'm in this camp as well, to download PDF with the best of intentions to review them, and then they just disappear into your your downloads folder. So that's been revamped to a, like, a 5 minute training to give you 5 5 step process on how to attack your your clutter in Canva for the first time or maybe not for the first time. And there's a little worksheet that goes with that as well.\

Liz Stapleton [00:28:31]:\
If you have any questions for Brenda, don't hesitate to go sign up for her list. Go follow her on social. Ask her those questions. She always sends out super helpful emails, like, every single week. I love getting her emails. So if you aren't on her list and you wanna be better with Canva or just using Canva like I said, I'm on her list. I'm not super organized, but I still am always learning from her. So, definitely, go sign up for her list.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:28:52]:\
And, Brenda, thank you so much for for sharing all this today.\

Hi, everyone. I am delighted to be participating in the Blogger Breakthrough Summit. And in this training, I'm going to be providing some guidance for you to become better organized when working in Canva. It is my favorite Canva related topic, and I hope that by the end of this training that you're feeling a little more excited about organizing your designs and images in your Canva account. You're likely watching this training because you are struggling to some degree with the level of organization in your own Canva account, or you might feel reasonably organized, but you're always looking for ways to tidy things up a bit more. The reality is that if you don't create some organizational structure using folders inside of Canva that you can easily maintain, what will very quickly happen is that you're going to start creating designs. And while at first it will feel manageable to simply scroll until you find the design you're looking for, you will inevitably reach a point where you have so many designs that scrolling and searching becomes too cumbersome. You won't be able to quickly find what you're looking for. You're going to feel a lot more overwhelmed and you're going to waste a lot of your time.\
\
[00:01:18.140] - Brenda\
Now, if you're new to Canva, it is the perfect time to set up your system before you get to the point of feeling overwhelmed by all of your designs and images. And if you're already a veteran user of Canva, you may be feeling like it's already out of control. But I promise that you can still create a system and get things back on track. It is never too late. My goal for this training is to try to meet you where you're at in your experience using Canva's organizational features. Some of what I talk about in this video you may already be comfortable with. While for others, it will be brand new. But hopefully, you'll walk away with at least one more tip or idea that you can implement in your Canva account in order to get more organized. So here's what we're going to cover in this training: what Canva projects are, why you should be using projects to access your designs instead of your Canva home screen, and how to navigate the projects area in Canva. Then I want to cover a couple of organizational basics, including how to create custom folders and subfolders, and why you should not be relying on your uploads folder for your images.\
\
[00:02:21.670] - Brenda\
We'll look at the process of how to batch-organize in Canva for better efficiency. And then, I'll take you through a basic framework for tackling your Canva account if it's already a hot mess, so that you can create your own organizational system. Let's start with a super quick introduction. My name is Brenda Cadman, and I live in Charlottetown on beautiful Prince Edward Island in Canada. I have been an entrepreneur for more than 23 years, with the majority of that time being spent running a website development company. And it was in late 2022 that I retired that website development business in order to focus all of my time on my role as a Canva and digital storage organization expert. And in addition to being a Canva-verified expert, I'm also a former professional organizer who specialized in organizing paper and filing systems. So, Canva organization is my sweet spot. Before we get started looking at the how-tos of getting organized in Canva, it's important to address that I'm making an assumption that you want to get more organized, and that you already see the benefits. But for those among you who might be on the fence and who might be wondering why you should care about getting organized, let's first take a quick look at some of the reasons that putting the time and effort into creating an organizational system in Canva or hiring someone to do it for you, why it's worthwhile.\
\
[00:03:40.450] - Brenda\
What are the benefits of getting organized in Canva? Well, you're going to save a lot of time and stress. Yes, you're going to have to invest some time upfront to do the organization, but ultimately, you are going to save a lot of time in the future, and that's going to lead to a variety of benefits. You'll see increased productivity and faster turnaround times. And I think this one is probably pretty obvious because, clearly, if you no longer have to spend a bunch of time searching for your designs, images, and templates, you're going to have more time to dedicate to actually creating the content that you need inside of Canva. Or, to focus on the tasks and projects that actually move the needle in your business, like sales and marketing and supporting your existing clients. And you're also going to absolutely see reduced stress and frustration. I think most business owners have been in a situation where they know they created something in the past that they'd really like to reuse as a starting point. Maybe it's a presentation, or an Instagram design, or a lead magnet, whatever it is, you may recall that you created something a month, or three months, or six months ago that you'd like to reuse so you don't have to start from scratch.\
\
[00:04:48.710] - Brenda\
Without an organizational system, you're going to find yourself scrolling to find that design, and inevitably, the frustration is going to settle in and you're going to waste time. With an organized Canva filing cabinet, you're going to spend a lot less effort searching for specific designs or images, which in turn is absolutely going to reduce any friction or frustration you're feeling while working in Canva. Your organization is also going to result in a more efficient team. When you have a team that needs to access the content in your Canva account, a hot mess filing disaster is not going to lead to great team efficiency. But if you have a well-organized Canva account, your team members are going to be able to find what they need faster so they can complete projects in less time. And finally, an organization system is going to provide you with a more clear focus, because you'll be able to eliminate the distractions and clutter that come with a disorganized workspace. When you know where everything is in your Canva account, you're not going to waste precious mental energy searching for the assets you need or getting sidetracked by irrelevant designs.\
\
[00:05:52.760] - Brenda\
Instead, you can focus your attention on the task at hand, knowing that everything you need is right where it should be. So, I think you get the point. And that point is that ultimately, there is a cost to Canva disorganization. And when you know how to create an organized system, and when you carve out a bit of time to implement that system, you are going to be able to create your Canva content much faster and with a lot less frustration. So, let's get into the how-tos and an FYI that most of the features I'm going to talk about in this training are available on both the free Canva plan as well as the Canva Pro subscription. There are three specific differences that I'll address, but for the most part, you will be able to apply the features and steps we talk about today, regardless of which plan you're on. The first thing I want to highlight is that for effective organization inside of Canva, you should not be working from Canva's home screen. Anytime I do a Canva training and I talk about organization, there is always a question related to how to organize the home screen so that it feels less overwhelming.\
\
[00:06:57.780] - Brenda\
And the answer is that you currently can't impose any organization or reordering of the content on Canva's home screen, which is why I want you to get used to coming down here to the Projects section of Canva. You will have complete control over creating folders and batch- organizing designs and images within the Projects section of your Canva account, but you don't have the same capability on your Canva homepage. Instead, the home screen is simply going to list all of the designs you've worked in with the most recently edited designs at the top. For this reason, I do recommend browsing for your designs directly from the Projects tab and skipping the homepage altogether. Inside of Projects, you'll find a couple of default folders that Canva creates, including Starred and Uploads. The Starred folder is where you can save your favorite or frequently used elements and templates. Basically, you can bookmark or star elements and templates that you like in Canva's library so that you can easily access them later on. For example, when you're in the template library, if you see a template that you want to refer to again later, you can hover over the top of it and click on the star icon, and then you'll find it shows up in the default Starred folder.\
\
[00:08:11.450] - Brenda\
You can also star a template from within the design editor by hovering over the template, clicking on the three dots, and then clicking the star. And you can do the same thing with graphics. So, for example, in the photos or the icons section in the template library, or when you're in the design editor in the elements area, if you see an element that you would like to favorite for future use, you can again click on the star to save it in the Starred folder. The other default folder you'll see is Uploads, which is one that you'll likely know well, as this is most often where you will have uploaded your own images into your Canva account. Finally, if you're on a free Canva plan, you'll likely also see a Purchased folder, which contains any design elements and templates that you have purchased or licensed from Canva's Premium Library. If you're on a Canva Pro or Teams plan, you'll have access to all elements and templates as part of your subscription, so there's no need for a Purchased folder. So, those are the default folders, but you can also create your own custom folders and subfolders in Canva.\
\
[00:09:15.070] - Brenda\
And in a minute, we'll talk about the mechanics of how to do that. But before we get to that, let's finish our little tour of the projects area. And on the left-hand side of the screen, you'll have your navigation for Projects. Note that your sidebar may look a little different by the time you watch this presentation. Canva has been doing a lot of modifications in this area, and it may still be in flux. So, if you do see something a little different, that's why. At the top of that left-side navigation, you can click on All Projects to go back to the main top-level Projects page at any time. You can click on Your Projects to see only the content that you have created or added, or you can click on Shared with You to see designs and images that have been shared with you from other accounts. Below those options, you will see a list of some of your recently opened designs, and then a little further down will be a list of all your custom folders. Also, if you have a custom folder that you want to regularly refer to, you can also star your folders.\
\
[00:10:10.970] - Brenda\
And this is different from the starring that I talked about earlier with templates and elements. Whereas those items end up in your Starred folder, when you choose to star one of your folders, it will be added to the primary Canva sidebar navigation. So, you'll see it here on the left-hand side on the main Canva dashboard. So let's briefly go through the mechanics of creating custom folders. You'll start by going to the Projects area. And if you've never created folders before in your Canva account, you can now do so by clicking on the Add New button that you'll find in the top right corner of your Projects page. When you do that, you'll have the option to add a folder. You'll give your folder a name, and then you'll click on Continue to create it. And then to create a sub-folder, you'll just walk through the same process. But instead of doing it at the top-level of Projects, you'll do it inside of one of your existing folders. So, step one is to open the folder where you want the sub-folder to live. Then, again, click on the Add New Button in the top right corner, and once again, choose to add a new folder.\
\
[00:11:11.920] - Brenda\
Then give the folder a name and click on the Continue button to create it. And then you can continue to create folders inside of folders as needed, and you can create an unlimited number of folders. The only limitation to be aware of is that you can only nest folders 10 levels deep. For example, I might create a main folder in Projects called Social Media to house all of my social media content designs. Inside of that folder, I could have a folder for Facebook, one for Instagram, one for Pinterest. And then perhaps inside of the Instagram folder, I might have a folder for designs, meant for my Instagram feed, and a separate folder for Instagram Reel Designs. If part of your blogging business includes digital product creation, you may also have a lot of your own templates that you sell or use as lead magnets. If that sounds like you, I would suggest that you consider keeping a separate folder for the templates that you've purchased or downloaded from other template creators, which you can break down into subfolders for each of those template source websites. And then keep that separate from your own Canva templates that you've created.\
\
[00:12:17.110] - Brenda\
So, for example, at my top-level of Projects, I have a templates folder that houses the templates I've gotten from other creators. And then I have a Digital Products folder that houses all of my own creations. Some other examples of folders you might want to create under your Digital Products folder are things like Design Assets, which could be broken down into various types of elements like backgrounds, icons, textures, shadows, etc. Plus, all bloggers are likely to have a multitude of size variations of the graphics they've created to support their blogging efforts. In fact, you probably have multiple versions of the same image. For example, you might create an image for your blog that is re-sized and re-purposed for all of your social media platforms. For example, Instagram posts, IG story graphics, Pinterest pins, LinkedIn images, and so on. As a result, over time, you may end up with hundreds or thousands of the same or similar designs in different sizes. Though, I'm sure it probably feels like you have millions of them. There is no single right answer in terms of how to organize your designs. And what works for you to find your designs may be very different than how someone else browses to find their past Canva designs.\
\
[00:13:28.850] - Brenda\
I talked about how you can break a Social Media folder down into subfolders for each social channel, and you may find that works for you. Or maybe you prefer having all your designs for a particular graphic size in a single design with multiple pages, and then creating a new design for each month. Or maybe you like to keep your blog post graphics organized by blog post rather than by the document type. As I said, there is no one-size-fits-all approach here, and you'll need to ask yourself how you would intuitively browse for your designs and create a folder system to support that. You may need to experiment with folder arrangements until you find something that best supports your browsing style. In preparation for this presentation, I did some surveying across a variety of blogger groups, and many complained of having tons of uploads and having to scroll through all of them to find the right images. You can also create folders to organize all of your images into categories to make it easier to find what you're looking for. As I just mentioned in the folder examples, you might have a folder for Design Assets, and then you could break it down into image subfolders for elements like backgrounds, icons, textures, and so on.\
\
[00:14:37.210] - Brenda\
Or if you use styled stock photos in your own marketing designs, you might have a folder for Styled Stock Photos that is then broken down by source website, and then further broken down into subfolders by subject matter or by color palette. A lot of people don't realize that you do not have to store all of your images in the Uploads folder. And to be honest, I would strongly advise against doing that because it just becomes a bottomless pit of images that makes it practically impossible to find what you're looking for over time. Now, I know many of you have chaotic Uploads folders, and image organization is an enormous, overwhelming challenge for a lot of Canva users. In fact, you have probably found yourself re-uploading the same image multiple times because you can't find it. You're going to be able to avoid that in the future if you have a clear organizational system for your images as well as your designs. If you want to continue using your Uploads folder, start to get into the habit of treating it like a temporary holding spot. Think of uploads like the in-tray on a physical office desk. And just like that in-tray, you don't want to treat the Uploads folder like a long-term storage solution.\
\
[00:15:47.790] - Brenda\
Once you're done with an image, move it into a more permanent folder, archive it, or delete it if you don't require it in the future. Or better yet, skip Uploads altogether and directly upload your images into the desired custom folder right from the start, rather than uploading it into your Uploads folder first and having to move it later. And you'll see that you can access your custom folders inside the design editor through the Projects tab. Also, I would encourage you to be mindful of how you are naming your designs. When you have as many image versions as many bloggers do, your naming conventions are going to be really important in addition to your folder organization. Because at a glance, a lot of your design thumbnails will probably look nearly identical, given that they are variations of the same design. You want to name your designs consistently, ensuring that the design name is descriptive and that it includes any keywords you might search to find the design. And that's because while having an organized folder system is really important, one of the fastest ways to find a specific design will often be to use the search field at the top of your page.\
\
[00:16:52.850] - Brenda\
That said, Canva has made searching even easier for you now with the introduction of the ability to search for keywords that appear not just in the name of your design file, but also any keywords that appear in the design itself. Media tagging can be very helpful as well in terms of searching for your image assets, and you can add tags to both images and video. Media tagging is only available on a Canva Pro account. So, if you do have a free plan when you go to access this feature, you'll be prompted to upgrade. You can access tagging by hovering over an image and clicking on the three dots. Then you'll see here that you have an option to add keyword tags. This is going to make it much easier for you to search for any image content in your Canva account in the future. So, for example, I could add the keyword framework to this image. And then if I search on framework in the search bar and hit Enter, you'll see that the image now shows up in my search results for that term, even though framework isn't in the name of the image file.\
\
[00:17:52.310] - Brenda\
Once you have your folders set up, it's going to be time to start moving your designs and images into their new homes. So, let's briefly walk through the steps to batch-organize inside Canva. If you've ever hovered over a Canva design or image, you'll have noticed that a checkbox appears and that you can select multiple designs or images at a time by checking off those checkboxes. When you select multiple files, you'll notice that a folder icon appears in the bottom middle of the page next to a trash icon. When you hover over that folder icon, it will say move to folder. And when you click on the folder icon, you will have the ability to choose which folder to move the designs to. You can locate a folder through this area called Recent, which shows the most recently accessed folders. Or, you can browse through all of your Project folders to find the desired folder, or you can search for a desired folder by searching on the folder name in this search bar. Once you've chosen the destination folder, you'll simply click on the option to move the files, and then Canva will move all of those files off of your Projects page and into your chosen folder.\
\
[00:18:58.640] - Brenda\
If you find that when you move files into a folder, it's not actually moving off of the main Projects page, there are a couple of things I want you to try for troubleshooting. First, try refreshing your browser tab after you've moved files to see if that files them away into the folders, and often it does. Same thing if you've deleted files from your Projects page and you're not seeing them deleted right away. Sometimes it just needs a page refresh to show the update. The second thing you can try is to make sure that this filter area on the projects page is set to show only your designs and not any designs shared with you. So, you can see how I filtered my projects here to only show designs and media from the Brenda Cadman account. So, let's move on to do a quick overview of a framework that you can use to help you get organized in Canva. When I teach how to get organized in my Clean Up My Canva course, I teach two different methods. First is the 'tackle the mess' approach, which is for those folks who are ready to organize all of their existing designs and images and to create an intuitive Canva organization system.\
\
[00:20:01.920] - Brenda\
And depending on how many designs and images you have in your account, this could be a potentially time-consuming project, though still very worthwhile. And if you have the bandwidth to do this, it is the approach that I definitely recommend. The second option is the 'start fresh' method. One of the biggest reasons that folks who know they need to get organized in Canva, and who want to get organized but still haven't done it, is because they have an absolutely overwhelming backlog of designs and images. So, this is the option for those Canva users who feel like their account is an organizational pit of despair and who have zero energy to organize it, but who want to be organized going forward. What I want to do in this video is to give you a quick overview of the 'tackle the mess' approach. Because since you're watching this training today, that likely means you already have a hot mess account that you would like to impose some order on. So, I'm going to walk you through five steps, and once you're comfortable with the organizing process, you will likely find that you're able to do more than one step concurrently.\
\
[00:21:08.180] - Brenda\
But I'd suggest breaking it down into steps when you're new to the process. The first step is focused on deleting and archiving your unneeded Canva designs and images. If you were organizing piles of paper in an office or a filing cabinet, you would start by disposing of the papers that you no longer need. You would also archive into long-term storage the documents that you may need for reference, but that you're no longer actively using. The same process applies for your digital content, including your Canva designs. So, I'd recommend you take a stroll down Canva memory lane and review all of the designs in your Canva account. Delete any of the designs that you know you don't need. So, for example, you may have copies of the templates you never ended up using; duplicates of designs you thought you would need but didn't; designs that are super outdated that you know you won't need, and so on. For those of you who are afraid to let go of any designs in case you might need it in the future, I would encourage you to create an archive folder and then move all of those 'But what if I need it down the road?' designs into that folder.\
\
[00:22:16.650] - Brenda\
If you haven't needed to access those archive designs in the next year, chances are good that you will feel safer doing a purge of them down the road. Next up is to do a review of what's left in your Canva account after you've finished deleting and archiving, and to update your naming conventions. If you're like most Canva users, you probably have a lot of designs named things like copy of template XYZ, or design version two and design version three and version four, etc. Or you've labeled it with a really generic name like Instagram post without providing any further description about which Instagram post it is, should you want to find it later. It's important to name your files in a descriptive manner so that you can easily tell at a glance what all of your designs are from the outside, and also so you can more easily search for your designs using the Canva search bar. And as I said, once you're comfortable using the organization features in Canva, you're going to be able to do more than one step concurrently. So, for example, while I'm working through an account to delete or archive content, I might simultaneously be renaming designs.\
\
[00:23:23.520] - Brenda\
Your third step is going to be to plan and create your folders. Write down a list of all the categories and subcategories you think you'll need to organize your designs, your images, and your videos. There is no one-size-fits-all solution about how to break down your folders within Canva. Some of you will only need a small handful of folders. Others will need a really robust filing system. As an example, my own Canva account is broken down into multiple folders, as you can see here. And then those primary folders are further broken down into subfolders as needed. I would recommend not having more top-level folders than you can see without scrolling. I have 12, and I find that 12 to 13 is usually the maximum that feels manageable before you start having too many choices and feeling overwhelmed. Once you have your initial list of folders, you can start actually creating your custom folders and subfolders in order to begin building your own Canva filing cabinet. Or you may find it makes more sense to create your folders as you go through the category creation process, whatever feels most natural for you. Once you've got your folders set up so that your designs and images all have homes, you can use the batch-organizing technique that I talked about earlier in order to begin moving all of your files into your new folders.\
\
[00:24:38.650] - Brenda\
And one of the best ways to start this process is to look for categories of designs, where you know there's going to be large chunks that you can move at a time. For example, if I'm doing an organization VIP day for a graphic designer that I know has tons of designs and assets for clients, I will start by selecting anything that I know can go into that top-level clients folder. I'm not going to worry at this stage about only selecting designs for a specific client. I'll tackle that later when I go through the client's folder. To start, you're just trying to organize your designs and images into those top-level categories, and then you can work your way down. And your final step will be to maintain your organization. Once you finish getting through the first four steps of this process, your organization system should be in good shape. But even the best system will fall apart if you don't maintain your Canva account. You can create a recurring task on your calendar or your project management tool of choice to do your Canva organization on a weekly, biweekly or even on a monthly basis.\
\
[00:25:37.400] - Brenda\
And I'd also recommend a periodic deep clean of your Canva account to review the content of your folders, and to delete and archive again as needed. This doesn't need to be very often, but this will also give you an opportunity to reassess your folder system and whether it's still working for you. Before I wrap things up, I want to address one more question that I hear fairly often whenever I talk to folks about getting organized in Canva, and that is how to get started cleaning up your Canva account if you've started the process, but things kind of stopped part way through. If you have a half-organized account, the first thing I would recommend is to assess why it's only partially organized. If you've already created a folder system with the intention of organizing your designs, but you've found it difficult to use, you'll want to ask yourself if you have the right folders in place. And you'll need to re-evaluate the content in your Canva account to determine what folder structure would actually make sense for you. If you're feeling too much friction with your existing folder setup, then it's most likely not the right one for you.\
\
[00:26:41.640] - Brenda\
And you'll need to adjust it so that you can create a filing system that's consistently easy to use and to maintain. Folder friction doesn't mean that you should abandon the idea of using folders in Canva. It means there is likely a folder structure that would be better and more effective for you to organize and find your content. So, that would be step number one, figure out whether or not your lack of organization is a result of the system that you've started to implement. If you know it's not the folder system that's causing the problem, and the reason it's only partially organized is because you simply can't find the time, energy, or bandwidth to complete the organization, then it may just be a matter of figuring out how to tackle it in smaller chunks or putting aside all of your old designs into a folder to tackle at a later date. So, you can just move forward with a clean slate until you're able to chip away at your past designs, or delegating the remaining organization project to somebody else to finish up. For example, if you have an assistant, if you have another team member, if you have a business partner who is more interested in the administrative side of things, it might be worth considering if you have to be the person to finish the organization project.\
\
[00:27:49.960] - Brenda\
I mentioned earlier that there were three organization related differences in the free Canva plan as compared to Canva Pro. I already talked about media tagging only being available on Pro, but there are a couple more differences to be aware of, and those are specifically the number of items you can store in a folder and the total storage space allotted to your account. In terms of the number of items you can have in a folder on the free plan, you can have 200 items, whereas on Canva Pro, it's 1,000 items. And in terms of storage on a free plan, you'll have five gigabytes of space, whereas you'll have one terabyte of storage space on Canva Pro. So, if you have a lot of images or videos that you're organizing in your account, you're going to find that storage space gets used up fairly quickly, whereas you'll have a lot more storage capacity on a Pro account. Otherwise, your experience using and moving content into folders should be the same, regardless of which plan you're on. But if you are on Canva's free plan and you want to test out Canva's Pro subscription for free, I do have a 45-day free trial that you can take advantage of.\
\
[00:28:56.790] - Brenda\
That's one of the perks of being a Canva-verified expert. I get to offer a 45-day trial instead of the usual 30-day trial. At the end of the day, I don't like to spend money on things that don't hold value for me. So, I definitely recommend that you try out the pro features for yourself to see if the value is there for you before you spend any money on it. If this training has inspired you to tackle your own Canva clutter, I have a resource that you may want to check out, and that is my Canva Organization Roadmap. It's a free guide that will essentially walk you through that framework from this training in a little more detail, in a format that you can more easily reference while you're actually tackling your own organization. You can grab a copy of that at brendacadman.com/roadmap. I sincerely hope this training was helpful for you and that you picked up a tip or two to help you create a more efficient Canva account.\

Couple years after I started my blog, but it's a whole nother shift to working at home. I was fortunate that my nine to five actually was home based. So I had that kind of experience and figured out a lot of stuff, but I still had a learning curve in certain things. So I'm excited for your session.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:00:40]:\
We're going to be talking about being.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:00:41]:\
More productive at home, is that correct?\
\
Brianna Berner [00:00:44]:\
Yeah, absolutely. And I find that that's one of the main things that so many people struggle with because we look at everything we want to do and then try to cram it all in without a game plan on how to actually get it done. Yeah.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:00:59]:\
And then you run into things of like, yes, I really want to get.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:01:03]:\
This done, but it's kind of hard.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:01:06]:\
So I'm going to procrastinate by doing the dishes or the laundry or like your house is never more clean than when you're procrastinating some form of work.\
\
Brianna Berner [00:01:14]:\
Absolutely. Procrastinate cleaning you're like, I'm being productive.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:01:22]:\
Yeah, it makes a difference.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:01:24]:\
So can you give us a little.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:01:25]:\
Bit sort of about your background, how you got to helping people with this and then highlight what we're going to.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:01:30]:\
Learn in your presentation?\
\
Brianna Berner [00:01:32]:\
Absolutely. So I am a professional organizer and a productivity coach. And a lot of the people that I've worked with over the past three years or so doing this are busy moms, stay at home moms, work at home moms, who are maybe they're trying to work with the kids still there, or they have 2 hours of free time and trying to figure out what they can do during that time period. So I've really just fine tuned everything that I do to accommodate that. One of the main things that we're going to be talking about in my presentation is always being intentional with that time, always knowing exactly what you're going to be working on every single time you sit down to work. Because you have an hour and a half to get something done. You spend half an hour of that figuring out what you're going to be working on. You've just lost so much time. So it just comes down to planning ahead and being prepared and planning for the different distractions and stuff that are going to be pulling you away and having a game plan so they don't interrupt your productivity day in, day out.\
\
Brianna Berner [00:02:41]:\
Over and over again so you can.\
\
Brianna Berner [00:02:43]:\
Get more done while you're working from home.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:02:45]:\
Yes.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:02:45]:\
And I can relate to this so hard because I live by myself. All my time was my own apart from my dog whining at me to go out.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:02:54]:\
And then I moved to family.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:02:57]:\
And now I'm like because my sister and brother in law work really early, so I do the kids in the morning. I pick my nephew up after preschool, so he's only gone I've got like 3 hours between dropping him off and him being home. And then there's the lawn guys and I'm watching him. And so I went from all the time in the world to like, this is the lessons I've had to learn this past year. So I'm really excited for your session.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:03:22]:\
I'm sure I'm going to learn more.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:03:23]:\
Because I've just been kind of fumbling figuring it out.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:03:26]:\
So let's dig into this.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:03:28]:\
I'm really excited.\
\
Brianna Berner [00:03:29]:\
All right, sounds great.\
\
Brianna Berner [00:03:32]:\
Okay, so today I'm going to walk you through the work at home Power method, which is my signature method to help you boost your productivity while working from home so you can truly unleash your potential onto the world. Because while working from home may be the dream, finding ways to stay productive can be challenging. I mean, if I don't feel like doing something, there's always something else that can easily distract me. Laundry, cleaning, Netflix, my cat. And I am absolutely a Procrastinative cleaner or Procrastinate napper when I have too.\
\
Brianna Berner [00:04:06]:\
Much on my plate.\
\
Brianna Berner [00:04:07]:\
And when that's the case, it's incredibly important to have some structure in place from allowing those things to take over your day. And even if you only have small pockets of time to work with, maybe your kids are home with you or you have other obligations throughout the day, it's still totally possible to get a lot done. My son was home with me during the day for about a year while I was building my business, which left me about 2 hours during the day to work while he napped, if he napped. And using just that time, I was able to create a massive 100 plus video online course in less than two months. On top of pushing out weekly blog posts, writing all of my emails, and all of the other stuff that I had to do to keep my business going. And I'm not telling you this to give myself a massive ego boost. I'm telling you this to prove that it's entirely possible to get a ridiculous amount of stuff done during the day, regardless of whether you have 2 hours.\
\
Brianna Berner [00:05:07]:\
Or eight, you just have to have.\
\
Brianna Berner [00:05:09]:\
A solid strategy in place. And today I'm going to give you the exact strategy that I use and the exact strategy that I teach my clients and students to really shoot their productivity through the roof. And it's my work at home Power method.\
\
Brianna Berner [00:05:27]:\
So my work at home Power method.\
\
Brianna Berner [00:05:30]:\
Is broken down into five parts.\
\
Brianna Berner [00:05:32]:\
So P is for planning ahead.\
\
Brianna Berner [00:05:35]:\
And this really is the most important part of the method and everything else builds off of this. Because if you only have 2 hours to work, you need to know exactly what you need to work on the minute you sit down. Even if you have 8 hours to work, you don't want to spend a.\
\
Brianna Berner [00:05:52]:\
Portion of that wasting time that you.\
\
Brianna Berner [00:05:55]:\
Could easily avoid in the first place. And planning ahead is how you get that done. O is for organization because let's face.\
\
Brianna Berner [00:06:04]:\
It, you're going to get so much.\
\
Brianna Berner [00:06:06]:\
More done each day if you're organized. And I'm not just talking about organizing your pens and paperclips so that they look pretty. I'm talking about setting up some systems in your home office to keep things moving and prevent wasted time. I'm also talking about organizing the different tasks that you need to get done, as well as everything on your to do list. So again, you always know exactly what you need to do when you sit down to work. W is for white space, then, because life's messy. And if you plan out every second of your day and then something happens, your entire day is going to be.\
\
Brianna Berner [00:06:45]:\
Thrown off no matter how organized you are.\
\
Brianna Berner [00:06:48]:\
And scheduling in plenty of white space throughout your day gives you the buffer you need to stay on track. And while I know that may sound counterintuitive, that flexibility is one of the key components to a highly productive day. E is for engagement because you have to be fully engaged with what you're working on. You can't split your attention between 50 different things and expect to get stuff done. You have to methodically and strategically work through things and you'll start seeing those little wins throughout the day. And I promise you, those feel so amazing. And then finally, R is for reflect and refine because no system will ever be perfect. And if you continuously improve what you're doing and refine it until it fits you and your lifestyle, you're only going to become more and more efficient over time. So let's take a look at each of these and how you can apply them to your life today to start seeing immediate results.\
\
Brianna Berner [00:07:51]:\
Okay, so the first step of the.\
\
Brianna Berner [00:07:54]:\
Work at home power method is planning ahead. You need to have a game plan for your day so that you can keep moving. Because Netflix and Cat snuggles are a lot more enticing when you don't really know what you should be doing in.\
\
Brianna Berner [00:08:08]:\
The first place, or when you look.\
\
Brianna Berner [00:08:10]:\
At everything you have to do and get totally overwhelmed.\
\
Brianna Berner [00:08:14]:\
So to start, you have to look.\
\
Brianna Berner [00:08:16]:\
At how much working time you have. Are you working from home from eight to five? Or maybe just from nine to twelve while your daughter's in preschool? Or maybe you just have that magical time from twelve to two while your son's napping to get stuff done. Whatever the case may be, write down what your working hours are.\
\
Brianna Berner [00:08:35]:\
Next, ask yourself when you have the.\
\
Brianna Berner [00:08:38]:\
Most energy during that time. Personally, I have the most energy during the morning, so I want to schedule in things that take the most brain power during that time. My low energy times are in the afternoon, so I schedule in things that don't take as much concentration during that time. And the reason you want to do this is so that you're working on the most difficult tasks while your brain is cooperating with you. This way, you're less likely to make mistakes which are more time consuming and.\
\
Brianna Berner [00:09:09]:\
Costly to fix after the fact.\
\
Brianna Berner [00:09:11]:\
And attacking those tedious and more difficult things on your to do list with full brain power makes it less likely that you'll make as many mistakes. It also makes it less likely that you'll do subpar work, which again, will just waste even more time when you have to go in and fix everything or completely redo it because it just wasn't up to your normal standards. It also prevents you from just scrapping the working time altogether because you're just not feeling it. Because those high energy tasks that you probably love doing are a lot less appealing when you're running on no energy. So you want to plan out your day with your energy in mind.\
\
Brianna Berner [00:09:53]:\
The next step then, is to create.\
\
Brianna Berner [00:09:56]:\
Time blocks during your working hours with your energy levels in mind. So, for example, since I have the most energy in the morning, I schedule two time blocks in the morning to work on my various high energy tasks. And I schedule them from nine to 1030 and eleven to 1230. Leaving time before and in between to take a break or deal with any small things that I need to knock off my to do list. Then I'll schedule two lower energy time blocks into my afternoon. The first is from one to 230.\
\
Brianna Berner [00:10:30]:\
The second from three to 430, and.\
\
Brianna Berner [00:10:33]:\
Then I pull whatever tasks I need to finish from my to do list and schedule them in during those times.\
\
Brianna Berner [00:10:40]:\
Now, if you have less time to.\
\
Brianna Berner [00:10:42]:\
Work during the day, time blocking is still totally possible. You'll just get fewer blocks of time.\
\
Brianna Berner [00:10:47]:\
To work on stuff.\
\
Brianna Berner [00:10:49]:\
For example, maybe you only have one time block in the morning and one.\
\
Brianna Berner [00:10:54]:\
Later at night once the kids are asleep.\
\
Brianna Berner [00:10:56]:\
For me personally, that morning time block would be my high energy time, and the one in the evening would be my low energy one. But I know myself well enough to only schedule in very low energy stuff that late in the day, because my brain just isn't working at that time. The important thing here, though, is that no matter how many time blocks you have, that it's still super important to physically schedule in what you're going to be working on so you don't waste.\
\
Brianna Berner [00:11:25]:\
Any time, and you do that by.\
\
Brianna Berner [00:11:27]:\
Getting yourself a little organized. So the next step to the work at home power method then is organization.\
\
Brianna Berner [00:11:35]:\
So in order to get the most.\
\
Brianna Berner [00:11:38]:\
Out of your day when you're working at home, you have to be organized and you have to have some killer systems in place.\
\
Brianna Berner [00:11:44]:\
So the first thing that you need.\
\
Brianna Berner [00:11:46]:\
To do is take some time to organize your space, because you don't want to waste 20 minutes cleaning off your desk or work area every time you.\
\
Brianna Berner [00:11:54]:\
Sit down to work.\
\
Brianna Berner [00:11:56]:\
So take a look at everything that tends to find its way to your desk. And then get rid of what you don't need and find a permanent home for everything else. Look at the stuff you're throwing away. Try to see if there's a way you can stop it from coming into your home in the first place.\
\
Brianna Berner [00:12:12]:\
For example, if it's a bunch of.\
\
Brianna Berner [00:12:15]:\
Junk mail that always takes over your desk, go to CatalogChoice.org and pull yourself off the different mailing list. Then set up a system for taking care of stuff as it comes in. Set up a shred zone that you always have access to and shred everything that you can the second that it comes into your space. Get a hanging file holder to organize the paperwork that you need regular access.\
\
Brianna Berner [00:12:39]:\
To and the stuff that you need.\
\
Brianna Berner [00:12:41]:\
To take care of, like bills and school forms. Go paperless if you can.\
\
Brianna Berner [00:12:46]:\
The point is to set up systems.\
\
Brianna Berner [00:12:49]:\
To prevent you and your family from just dumping stuff in your office by creating places for everything to go. Then get in the habit of putting stuff away rather than just tossing it wherever. Because it really only takes a couple of seconds to put something away if you have a place to put it. And if you catch yourself saying that you'll just do it later, then remind yourself that it only takes 2 seconds and it'll make your life so much easier. Stay on top of it and it will eventually just become second nature to put things away right away. Next, you need to organize your workflow and your to do list so that you always know exactly what you're going to be working on when you sit down to work. So the first thing that you need to do is trim the unnecessary things from your to do list. Because an overflowing to do list just leads to overwhelm and feeling inadequate when you never cross everything off. So set yourself up to win by only having stuff on there that you actually have to do. So take a look at your to do list. First, pinpoint the different things that you're constantly skipping over or ignoring. Think about the different things that always seem to be on your to do list that never get crossed off.\
\
Brianna Berner [00:14:04]:\
Now take a minute to ask yourself.\
\
Brianna Berner [00:14:07]:\
Why you keep skipping them. Is it something you don't like doing? Is it just not important? Or maybe it is important, you just haven't found the time to actually do it. If things are constantly getting skipped over, you need to either make time for it, have someone else do it, automate.\
\
Brianna Berner [00:14:25]:\
It, or just take it off your.\
\
Brianna Berner [00:14:26]:\
To do list altogether. If it is something important, then take a second and schedule in a day and time to actually get it done. Things that are important but not necessarily urgent, like they don't have a hard due date, can easily get skipped over, but it's important to get them done, so schedule them in. If it isn't important, you should probably take it off your list because you should only be focusing your time and energy on projects that are aligned with your values, your vision and your aspirations, and the normal day to day tasks that keep your family and your business going. So next we need to set up some systems. And systems are incredibly important to have because they save you a lot of time by streamlining the way you do certain things. So, to figure out what sort of systems you can implement, you need to look at how you typically spend your day and then pinpoint any areas where you're spending way too much time. Are there certain tasks that just seem to take forever to complete? Or maybe certain things that you just dread doing? If you're spending too much time on something, you need to either create a system to streamline it or find a way to automate at least part of it. Another good place to set up some systems is to look at the different things that you do the same way over and over again. Now, hopefully you're already doing these things the same way every time, and if you aren't, then you should be. Because when you do things the same way every time, you begin to develop a rhythm or a pattern. And as you continue to do it this way, you naturally begin to work through it faster. So take a look at the different things on your to do list, pinpoint the tasks that you tend to do a lot or that just take way too long to do, and set up a standard way to always do them.\
\
Brianna Berner [00:16:18]:\
Okay, so now that we've trimmed what.\
\
Brianna Berner [00:16:21]:\
We can off of your to do list, we need to organize what's left, which may help you knock a few more things off as well. And the purpose of doing this is so that whenever you sit down to work, you again always know exactly what you need to work on. This is incredibly important because it prevents you from wasting time trying to figure that out in the moment.\
\
Brianna Berner [00:16:42]:\
Because think about it, if every single.\
\
Brianna Berner [00:16:45]:\
Time you sit down to work you wasted five or ten minutes deciding what to do, you're not going to get as much done. And all that wasted time really adds up throughout the week.\
\
Brianna Berner [00:16:56]:\
But if you spend a few minutes.\
\
Brianna Berner [00:16:58]:\
Here and there making sure that your to do list is prepped, you'll be able to get more done.\
\
Brianna Berner [00:17:03]:\
So the first thing that we need.\
\
Brianna Berner [00:17:05]:\
To do is organize the different tasks on your list.\
\
Brianna Berner [00:17:08]:\
So break your to do list down.\
\
Brianna Berner [00:17:11]:\
Into high and low energy tasks. If you're a work at home mom, you can create a third list of things you can do while the kids are around and climbing all over you or if you have a job outside of the house as well.\
\
Brianna Berner [00:17:23]:\
You can create a third list of things that you can do while you're.\
\
Brianna Berner [00:17:26]:\
On your breaks or during other downtime. And what you consider a high energy task will completely depend on the things that take you a lot of brain power to work on. And what you consider low energy will be those things that you can kind of do on autopilot.\
\
Brianna Berner [00:17:43]:\
So next, you need to prioritize the.\
\
Brianna Berner [00:17:46]:\
Tasks on each list. Put things that are urgent and important.\
\
Brianna Berner [00:17:51]:\
First, then things that are important but.\
\
Brianna Berner [00:17:53]:\
Not really urgent, then things that are urgent but not really important, and finally the things that are neither urgent nor important.\
\
Brianna Berner [00:18:02]:\
And honestly, take a little time while.\
\
Brianna Berner [00:18:04]:\
You're doing this to consider whether the.\
\
Brianna Berner [00:18:06]:\
Things that aren't important even need to.\
\
Brianna Berner [00:18:09]:\
Be on your to do list. And if they don't, then get rid of them. So, like I said earlier, you're going to want to knock things off your high energy list when you have the.\
\
Brianna Berner [00:18:18]:\
Brain power to do so.\
\
Brianna Berner [00:18:20]:\
And you're going to want to work on the low energy tasks when you would rather be sitting on your couch binging on Netflix with a pint of ice cream. Understanding your energy cycles and your own circadian rhythm is essential for this. So pay attention to the times throughout the day when you normally have a lot of energy and the times when you're pretty wiped out. And ultimately you want to try to plan out your day so that you schedule in the important stuff. So look at the high energy time blocks you created and then schedule in the first task on your prioritized high energy list. Don't put more than one thing. Worst case, if you get that done, then you can just start on that next task.\
\
Brianna Berner [00:19:02]:\
Then if you have an unexpected 30.\
\
Brianna Berner [00:19:05]:\
Minutes to work on something, grab the next thing off that list. This way, you always know exactly what you need to work on when you.\
\
Brianna Berner [00:19:12]:\
Sit down to work and you want.\
\
Brianna Berner [00:19:14]:\
To do the same thing with low energy tasks, doing this is going to.\
\
Brianna Berner [00:19:18]:\
Save you a lot of time and.\
\
Brianna Berner [00:19:20]:\
Really help you get so much more done.\
\
Brianna Berner [00:19:24]:\
Okay, so the next step of the.\
\
Brianna Berner [00:19:26]:\
Power method is white space.\
\
Brianna Berner [00:19:28]:\
And this step is absolutely crucial because.\
\
Brianna Berner [00:19:32]:\
If you plan out every second of your day, you're always going to be stressed out when things don't go according to plan.\
\
Brianna Berner [00:19:40]:\
For example, let's say that you schedule.\
\
Brianna Berner [00:19:43]:\
Three time blocks in your morning, one from nine to ten, one from ten to eleven, and one from eleven to twelve. And you schedule in one task to work on during each of these times. You're probably going to be super pumped that you'll get all of that done in one morning, right? Well, your son dumps cheerios all over himself right as you're about to walk out the door. So you have to run upstairs and.\
\
Brianna Berner [00:20:06]:\
Change him, making you 15 minutes late. So does that 15 minutes come from.\
\
Brianna Berner [00:20:12]:\
That first time block?\
\
Brianna Berner [00:20:13]:\
Does that only leave you then with.\
\
Brianna Berner [00:20:16]:\
45 minutes to complete whatever it was that you had scheduled in? The other option is to start the next block 15 minutes late. Well, at 1030, you get an email from a client and you have to fix something right away. Where does that time come from? Your 10:00 block, your 11:00 block? And what happens to the stuff that you scheduled in during those times? Well, more than likely, they don't get done. Your morning shot, you got maybe half of the stuff done that you had.\
\
Brianna Berner [00:20:45]:\
Planned and you're bumped you're in a.\
\
Brianna Berner [00:20:47]:\
Bad mood for the rest of the day.\
\
Brianna Berner [00:20:49]:\
As a result, to avoid this, you.\
\
Brianna Berner [00:20:51]:\
Want to schedule white space into your day. And what I mean here is that you want to leave empty space between your different time blocks, client calls, and whatnot to accommodate all of the unexpected things that more than likely will happen. This way, you have a little wiggle room.\
\
Brianna Berner [00:21:08]:\
If something comes up, if it's something.\
\
Brianna Berner [00:21:11]:\
Quick, you can take care of it during your breaks. If it's going to take longer, you can use that time to schedule it in so that you know it'll get done. Rearranging your schedule if needed. So the next step of the work at home power method is engagement. In order to be productive during the day, you have to be engaged with what you're doing. You can't focus on 50 things at once. You need to engage with one thing at a time. See, as entrepreneurs, we're ideas people and we're passionate. So it's really easy for us to get super passionate about all of our amazing ideas. But think about it, if you're spreading all of your energy between 50 different amazing ideas, then each can only get about 2% of your time.\
\
Brianna Berner [00:21:57]:\
But if you take the time to.\
\
Brianna Berner [00:21:59]:\
Pinpoint the exact things that you need to focus on and then methodically work through them, then those things will get 100% of your time. So if you're working on two or three or four projects at once and you're jumping back and forth between them, it's taking you a lot longer to.\
\
Brianna Berner [00:22:16]:\
Finish them than it should.\
\
Brianna Berner [00:22:18]:\
If you instead just push through one project and then the next and so.\
\
Brianna Berner [00:22:22]:\
On, you would be getting through your.\
\
Brianna Berner [00:22:24]:\
Projects a lot faster, meeting your goals a lot faster, and seeing the change in your business and your life. That these goals create a lot faster.\
\
Brianna Berner [00:22:33]:\
To add to that every time you shift context.\
\
Brianna Berner [00:22:37]:\
Meaning every time you move from one thing to the next, it slows you down, because your brain needs time to become acquainted with that new task. So when you're multitasking, your brain is constantly trying to get up to speed. But context shifting isn't necessarily any better because you're wasting time every single time you shift context, because your brain needs that time to get up to speed in these instances as well. So Gerald Weinberg found in a study that every time you contact switch that you're wasting about 20% of your time. So if you have 2 hours to work on something and you decide that 50% of that time you'll be working on one project, and 50% of the time you'll be working on another project, that you'll actually only get about 30% of that time for the second project because you lose 20% of the time switching gears from the first to the second.\
\
Brianna Berner [00:23:30]:\
Now, this isn't to say that you.\
\
Brianna Berner [00:23:32]:\
Have to work on the exact same thing for that entire 2 hours, but if you keep working on the different tasks within a project, your brain won't need that time to get reacquainted because you're staying on the same topic. So it's really important to only be engaged with one project at a time.\
\
Brianna Berner [00:23:50]:\
If you have client work or other.\
\
Brianna Berner [00:23:53]:\
Stuff that you need to work on, spread that stuff out throughout your different time blocks, making sure that you're not forcing yourself to switch contexts within each block, saving you time in the process. But in order for this to work, you need to know how long your various projects are going to take to.\
\
Brianna Berner [00:24:10]:\
Complete, because you don't just want to.\
\
Brianna Berner [00:24:12]:\
Keep writing the same project down over and over again in your different time blocks. So the first thing that you need to do is make sure that the project is set in a concrete, tangible way, so that you know, without a.\
\
Brianna Berner [00:24:25]:\
Doubt, once it's done, then you need.\
\
Brianna Berner [00:24:28]:\
To break the project down into all of the different steps you need to take to get it done. And finally, you need to assign due dates for all the steps to make sure that they get done and so that you stay on schedule. When creating your projects, you want to avoid abstract or ambiguous language. You don't just want to say something like I want to create more content, or I want to get more customers and so on. I mean, these are great things to want, and they may line up perfectly with your values, your vision and your aspirations, but they're not clearly defined projects. For a goal or a project to have an impact, you have to be clear on the exact outcome you want and how you'll know when you achieved it. So something like I want to write three new blog posts or I want to get 100 new email subscribers is easier because, you know, without a doubt.\
\
Brianna Berner [00:25:19]:\
Once you hit those numbers, plus it's.\
\
Brianna Berner [00:25:22]:\
Always easier to create a game plan to hit those specific numbers. The next step then, is to map out the different steps that you need.\
\
Brianna Berner [00:25:29]:\
To take to get it done. When you do this, you want to.\
\
Brianna Berner [00:25:33]:\
Try to think of all the steps you'll need to take. But none of this is necessarily set in stone. You have to allow for some degree of flexibility as you work through the project. So keep that in mind. But let's go back to the Write Three blog post example. Because it's pretty cut and dry, you would break down the different things you need to do to make that happen keyword research, writing the article, editing it, creating your graphics, and so on. The final thing we need to do then, is to give all of those.\
\
Brianna Berner [00:26:01]:\
Steps a due date so you could.\
\
Brianna Berner [00:26:03]:\
Schedule in keyword research for the first article into one time, block writing it into another, editing and formatting it into another, and so on. And after you do this, you'll have an action plan in place to complete your first project and to get it done a lot sooner than if you were trying to get a bunch of other stuff done at the same time.\
\
Brianna Berner [00:26:25]:\
Okay, so far I've given you the.\
\
Brianna Berner [00:26:28]:\
Exact framework you need to set yourself up for success, to get more done during the day, and to start crushing your goals. But the last piece of the puzzle is absolutely essential to that success. So the last step of the Power method is refine and reflect. As you're working through things, you need to allow yourself to be flexible. And to be clear, I don't mean being flexible on the goals or projects themselves. Once you've set a goal, you need to commit to it and see it through. But you do need to allow some flexibility in the steps you'll take to get there.\
\
Brianna Berner [00:27:03]:\
Because as you're working through a project.\
\
Brianna Berner [00:27:06]:\
You may realize that you need to add in a step that you didn't plan for, or that a step you already have scheduled isn't really necessary. And a lot of times you won't know this until you're in the trenches, or you may realize that you're doing something that just doesn't mesh well with your style and how you normally do things. And that's totally cool because life is a learning process, so it's only natural to figure things out about yourself as you go. And this is why it's so important to schedule in time to check in on everything that you're doing, to reflect on what's working and what isn't working. And you don't need to wait until the end of a project or the end of the month or quarter to do this. Anytime you're working on something, you should schedule in checkpoints throughout it to make sure that you don't need to make.\
\
Brianna Berner [00:27:53]:\
Any adjustments.\
\
Brianna Berner [00:27:54]:\
Don't just stubbornly demand that what you've.\
\
Brianna Berner [00:27:57]:\
Decided has to work.\
\
Brianna Berner [00:27:58]:\
Check your stats or do a gut check and see how things are going. And if something just isn't panning out the way you thought it would, make any small adjustments that you need to make to get back on track. And you don't have to just focus on the things that aren't working either. Make sure that you take note of what is working so you can expand on that and get even better results next time. As entrepreneurs, our businesses will always grow and evolve as we do.\
\
Brianna Berner [00:28:26]:\
And allowing ourselves to make these small.\
\
Brianna Berner [00:28:29]:\
Pivots over time is so important to keeping our business relevant to our ever changing values, visions, and aspirations, but also to keep up with the ever changing demands of our customers and our audience. So embrace growth and let it happen organically from your experiences. Take the time to schedule in these routine checks, and over time, you'll find your own way to really assess the health of your business and how efficient you've been with your time, your energy, and your resources as you start to do this regularly. It's a system that has to be implemented and improved upon over time. And if there's one thing I want you to take away from this training, I want it to be that. It's the systems that you implement in your business and how you allow them to grow with you that will ultimately dictate how often you reach your goals, how efficient you are with your time and how much you actually get done. And that is my Work at home Power method. It's designed to be incredibly simple so that it's easy to implement. But the simplicity of it is why.\
\
Brianna Berner [00:29:37]:\
It works so well, because it gives.\
\
Brianna Berner [00:29:39]:\
You the structure to plan out your day in a way that makes sense to you, how you function and the different things that you have going on. It gives you the flexibility to make adjustments as you go and not be totally thrown off when the unexpected happens. Because let's be real, the unexpected is going to happen, and it gives you the ability to knock your projects out faster than ever because you have a solid game plan. So now that you have the Work at Home Power method, I hope it helps you restructure your day so that you can start getting more done in less time, building a life that you're wildly passionate about in the process.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:30:17]:\
All right, Brianna, thank you so much for all that useful information. I know it's definitely going to help me in better structuring my days. I'm sure everyone else found that useful as well, so thank you.\
\
Brianna Berner [00:30:28]:\
Of course.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:30:29]:\
So, any final words for attendees trying to do better working at home?\
\
Brianna Berner [00:30:36]:\
I guess my biggest tip that I.\
\
Brianna Berner [00:30:39]:\
Can give is just be intentional and plan ahead. And I know that so many people think that that's just more time they have to dedicate to something. But spending those five minutes checking in with how things are going, how things went and what you need to maybe change in your day to day schedule can really make all the difference. So that is the main thought that I want to leave everyone with today.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:31:05]:\
Okay.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:31:06]:\
And then we do want to let everyone know you have a great free offer. The link is below, but can you.\
\
Brianna Berner [00:31:10]:\
Tell us what it is?\
\
Brianna Berner [00:31:11]:\
Absolutely.\
\
Brianna Berner [00:31:12]:\
So I have a free five day productivity challenge that builds off of everything that you learned here today to really help you minimize the things on your to do list so you can simplify and streamline everything that you have going on. Yeah, like you said, the links below, but you can find that at Spikedparentingchallenge. And I really think it will add to everything that I've already walked you through today to really help you just get more done in less time and just start crushing your to do list.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:31:43]:\
Yes, crush your to do list. Get your stuff done. Be present in your life. Life is more about just blogging about it.\
\
Brianna Berner [00:31:50]:\
Absolutely. For sure.\
\
Brianna Berner [00:31:51]:\
Yes.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:31:52]:\
So definitely check out that challenge. Brianna, again, just thank you so much for your generosity and your time.\
\
Brianna Berner [00:31:57]:\
I really appreciate it.\
\
Brianna Berner [00:31:59]:\
Thank you so much for having me.\

[00:00:09.920] - Cara Harvey, apurposedrivenmom.com\
Hey there! I hope you are so excited to dive into my session today on how to create a batch system for your business. I've got a lot of really great stuff planned for us, and I'm going to try to get you the links of what I'm working on so it can be like you and me are just sitting across the Target Cafe table, six feet apart, working on our batch planning together. We are going to cover a lot in this action-packed session, including how and why you should be creating a batch system and how it can really help you through extra productivity, how you can systematize your tasks to know what to work on when we're going to talk about how to map your content plan out and how to use time blocking to efficiently use your day. We're also going to talk about one of the hardest things, which is asking for help and delegation, and how when you start to do that, you will be able to be more efficient in your business. Before we jump in, I'd love to stop, pause, and introduce myself. My name is Cara Harvey. I'm the founder of A Purpose Driven Mom, where I help moms 3x their productivity so that they can take massive action on their goals.\
\
[00:01:06.500] - Cara\
Over the course of the past 3+ years, I've not only been able to help thousands of women in the courses that I have about productivity and time management, but I can impact them through my Podcast, which is the Purpose Driven Mom Show and I get to see moms who struggle to find time for themselves and their goals and I get to help them find that time. And that's what I want to help you do. Because if you are an entrepreneur trying to make space and margin inside your day to work and you don't have a batch system, you are wasting so much time and you are not being efficient.\
\
[00:01:37.970] - Cara\
But it's OK because we're not here to point fingers. We're here to show you some aha moments and I want to see them. So listen, I'm over on Instagram at apurposedrivenmom, take a picture at any point today. Let me know that you're watching and I want to hear your big takeaway. So drop in my DMs. I'll send you a voice memo and we can chat because I don't want this to be another presentation that you sit and you watch and you're like,\
\
[00:01:57.590] - Cara\
"That's cool. I'll do it later."\
\
[00:01:59.100] - Cara\
I want you to take action. Okay? So question for you right now. Ask yourself, write it down on some paper, hopefully, you have something to write with. On a scale of one to ten, how efficient would you say you are right now at managing your time and your business? Now, this is very interesting because today you could feel like a ten, and tomorrow you can feel like two. Give an average when it comes to managing your time, when it comes to all the things that fall on your plate, where do you fall, where do you land?\
\
[00:02:26.570] - Cara\
What does it feel like for you? Because wherever you're at right now, what I really hope and pray is that we are able to jump you up from a two to a four, a four to a six, a six to an eight, an eight to ten, wherever you want to go, by the time we're just done talking, this is without any implementation. So if you're ready, let's do it. OK, here are the pillars of batching we're going to talk about today, we've got four.\
\
[00:02:48.680] - Cara\
Pillar one is how to categorize your tasks. And I'm going to show you how I do all of this via Trello. If you're like "What is Trello? I don't want to learn Trello. I don't like technology." Don't worry, friend. You can do everything that I teach you on a piece of paper. OK, so like I said, I have a piece of paper. Now, this Trello board that I have, I'm going to make sure I submit it with my presentation because it is a template that you can copy and I've done a lot of the work for you, so you are welcome in advance. I'm going to show you how to do it. We're also gonna talk about how you can pre-map your content plan out. Pillar three would be creating your time blocks and the fourth pillar is pre-planning your work. So we have a ton to talk about. Let's jump into step one, which is creating your batch groups. Now, there are two ways that you can batch your time. One of them essentially is a batching by task.\
\
[00:03:34.350] - Cara\
Alright? So this is saying that on Mondays I'm going to write every email I have to write for the whole week. Right? No matter what, if it's for my membership, if it's for my course, if it's a newsletter, for a Podcast, whatever it is. OK, that's batching by task. You can also batch by content pillar. This is saying on, I'm working on a project, right? So, say I'm working on my membership, which I think will be able to show you in here.\
\
[00:03:58.280] - Cara\
And if not, we can even jump into one of my personal Trello boards, I think, and I'll show you what that looks like. So I also batch by content pillar. So I do my initial batching with Mondays are emails, Thursdays are podcasts, etc. but then I also will batch by project. So I'll write all the tasks I have to do for a project down and I'll work on it where like, Wednesday is membership day and I only work on the membership.\
\
[00:04:21.320] - Cara\
OK, you can work on these simultaneously. You can switch it up with what you do each day. Alright? This can work whatever way you want to. The first thing I want you to do though is create a list of all the things that you do for your task. So I wrote this on paper and then I'm going to jump on over to Trello because that's my zone of genius and where I love to spend time. So here's just a really, really easy example.\
\
[00:04:43.640] - Cara\
I need to write a blog post. What are all of the steps? What are all of the things I need to do to get this blog post up and running? Well, I need to do my SEO research, then I want to create my outline. After my outline is done, I like to go through and make headlines and H2s based on my outline. After that's done, I can create all my images. I like to find some affiliates that fit in that blog post.\
\
[00:05:04.490] - Cara\
Then I want to write out and draft out, take all those out, that outline, and really write those paragraphs out. Edit, format. Write the social media, make a newsletter blast for it, and promotion. Whew, right? That's a lot of steps. That's a lot of things that have to get done. But when we start with this step. Yes. Can it feel overwhelming? Yeah, sure thing. But it doesn't have to because it can feel empowering because it can help us batch together.\
\
[00:05:26.930] - Cara\
So let's jump into Trello. I'm going to give you a bird's eye view of how we're going to do it on Trello and then we're going to break it all down. So I'm going to be flopping and flipping back and forth here.\
\
[00:05:36.500] - Cara\
If you've never used Trello, welcome, this is Trello! Trello is where I like to map and brain dump and plan all of my things. I use a couple of systems when it comes to my business to make it more efficient. And my trifecta is Trello, ClickUp, and AirTable. So I'm going to show you how we do it on Trello right now. OK, if you've never used it, I am going to make sure I submit this board. You're going to hit "Create board from template."\
\
[00:06:00.020] - Cara\
You're going to have to create, this is a free Trello account. You give it whatever name you want. You save it to whatever team you want to have it on and boom, it's yours. Once it's yours, you will not see this bar and you are free to edit it and make it your own, okay? Some basics on Trello, these things that are horizontal here, these are your lists. OK, so what I'm saying list, that's what I mean.\
\
[00:06:20.530] - Cara\
These things going vertically.\
\
[00:06:21.940] - Cara\
These are your cards. All right? These are your cards right here. The basics, all you need to know. So let's walk through pillar number one and step one. And that's going to be brain dumping all of the things that have to get done.\
\
[00:06:33.590] - Cara\
So if you use my template, I've already done this work for you. Again, you're welcome. You don't even have to do it. You can add in specifics. Now, the reason I like to do this is because it tells me what I have to do. Now, this is "ideal world." I know that, like for my Podcast, for example, we don't have it up on YouTube right now, but we would like to have it up on YouTube.\
\
[00:06:50.020] - Cara\
But I might write down add to YouTube as something on there so that we can vision cast. I can say this is where I would like to go. You don't have to have it all on there. OK, so here's the blog workflow that I said. Keyword research, outlines, exact same from the presentation, creative video, format it, pin it to Pinterest. OK, so there it is? Here's my Podcast workflow. So I want you to brain dump if you write a Podcast. Do a content plan, outline the episodes, record, make your images, make the Wave videos for promotion, do social media posts, or do a review of the week, edit the episode. You can see it goes on and on and on. Here's an example of how I broke it down for social media. Everything I got to do for social media. Instagram images. OK, so we gotta do the captions, research hashtag, Instagram daily engagement, analytics, answer my DMs. All right? And then here's something for videos. Here's an example of you used, I don't know, YouTube. You've got to find stock images and personal images, and you've got to make freebie images, and mockups, and everything.\
\
[00:07:48.070] - Cara\
So this is like everything now. The Podcast flow is sequential. I do these things in this order. The video images? This is not sequential. This is just literally everything I have to do when it comes to making videos and images for my business. OK? Now what's cool about Trello is you can drag these cards. So I recommend you just like brain dump it all out and then you can drag them and put them in a sequential order.\
\
[00:08:14.530] - Cara\
So let's say YouTube is one of your pillars. And as you can see, I've got a whole bunch of lists for you and, at the very end, you can add another list. So if you've got another content pillar you can put it in here. I put Shipping, I don't ship anything, but maybe you want to say, like, what are all the steps for shipping, for Coaching, for Twitter, for Research. However, you want to break it down, OK?\
\
[00:08:32.050] - Cara\
You can even make it for Product. So like, for me, that would be like my membership and then I would break down like all the things I do for my membership type of a thing. Okay? So let's do a YouTube example together. OK, if I was to do YouTube, now, again, I know these things are here under Video, so you could just drag them over if you want or we can start over. So if I want to do YouTube, I want to do, like, content research, and then I'm just going to enter to make a new card.\
\
[00:09:00.040] - Cara\
I need to outline the video. I need to record the video. I need to edit the video. I need to come up with a thumbnail. I need to do some, like, hashtag research for it. I guess this would also be like hashtag SEO research. We want to upload it. We need to pin it to Pinterest. We need to promote to email lists. Promote to IG and Facebook. OK, so see, I'm just literally going through and I'm writing all my tasks down.\
\
[00:09:38.230] - Cara\
That is just Step One. Step One is literally just a brain dump to get it out of your head. And again, this might not be all things that are happening right now. This could be like "ideal world." And what's cool is inside Trello, you could use these little labels. So let's go to YouTube, for example. So pretend we've got YouTube as one of our content pillars. We could go here and edit labels and we're going to just make a label. It would be like In Progress, so this is like stuff we already do. And then we're going to make another label and we're going to call this like Future Vision. So this is like stuff I'd like to do. So if, for example, I'm like, I do YouTube, but it's literally like for us, I film my Facebook lives once a week and we just toss it on YouTube. Like, we pretty much just, like, upload it and put it on YouTube, but we would. So that would be like In Process.\
\
[00:10:27.370] - Cara\
So let's add a label to that. Edit labels, here we go, In Progress. Everything else is so random. Like, I mean, I do outline the video, so I'll put that in, but I don't have anything else here. So I'm not really doing much research. I'm just guessing, to be honest, it's like such a random strategy. So I would put that as like future vision. Like I would like to do this, but at this point in the way my time is, I just don't see where it fits.\
\
[00:10:51.190] - Cara\
OK, so record video, I could go through and say this is obviously something I have to do. I don't do any editing of the video. Maybe one day we'll do that. We do make a special thumbnail for it. So I'm going to say, OK, that's In Progress. I'm not doing any SEO research. It's like super random that would be something we need to do. We do pin it to Pinterest. I do promote it to my email list. And then I do share it on my social, so I actually, you know, I was with the dog myself. I'm doing better than I thought!\
\
[00:11:24.380] - Cara\
Oh, and then, like, embedded into a blog post. That we do too. So after you've gone ahead and you've created this, I want you to then do this. Is it in progress? Is it my vision? Like where am I right now? Because that's going to give us a better look at holistically where we're going to spend our time. All right. So once we've done that, I want to do a tight inventory. Now, I always recommend you start when you're creating systems and routines in your business.\
\
[00:11:49.040] - Cara\
Start with the end in mind. What is your vision? Where do you want to go? We just did that. Then go back to create your baseline. Where am I? This will allow you to see things you can group together. It'll also let you think about where you want to work in your zone of genius. Maybe you have something on your time inventory like filming a video, for example, when your kids are awake and it takes you nine hours because you have to keep pressing pause.\
\
[00:12:12.050] - Cara\
Right? That's not efficient, but you won't know that until you do the time inventory. It also is going to, it's going to tell you where you're wasting time. And I don't want to point any fingers. Right. But we love to waste time on things that don't matter. And so we're going to learn that. It's going to help you fill the gaps and do your workflows. So if I'm doing a time inventory for my Podcast, I have this whole list I made on Trello of everything I wanted to do.\
\
[00:12:33.740] - Cara\
Right? But, but, but, maybe I forgot a couple of steps because I have the curse of knowledge, you know, the curse of knowledge where like you think you know all the steps and then you try to teach it to someone else and you realize you missed a million things. So what I want to do is I want you to create a time inventory. So this is something I, I just do it on Trello card or on a piece of paper and I do it for about three to five days.\
\
[00:12:57.140] - Cara\
Now, what you're going to do once you've done your time inventory is we're going to go back into Trello and you're going to write down how long things take. OK, so you could do it a few ways. So these are like estimated time. So say I was doing my...let's do our social media. So say I was posting in my Facebook groups every day. OK, so, you know, say that takes me seven minutes. And I realize that when I'm doing it that I don't have planned out in advance what I want to say on my Facebook group.\
\
[00:13:26.390] - Cara\
So I'm wasting time thinking what would be a good post. And then I go to Google and I'm like icebreaker questions for your Facebook group. And then it's seven minutes later and you finally get a post up. OK, then you would type all that in here, right? Like wasted time finding a post.\
\
[00:13:42.470] - Cara\
Opened Facebook and got lost in the scroll. All those little notes, I want you to write them down for yourself, then you're going to have a really good idea of how long things take. Now our next step is delegation, which you might not be ready for right now, which is totally fine. No worries at all. But I want you to start thinking about delegating. You do not have to be the person doing every little thing in your business.\
\
[00:14:04.850] - Cara\
And I'm gonna tell you, it wasn't until last year, like, a literal year from today, that I hired my first person. For two years, I did everything by myself and then I hired someone else. And when I hired someone else, it was the scariest thing that I did. But it was amazing because I didn't have to do it all. I have to be everywhere. And then my brain was free to actually be the CEO and visionary of my business.\
\
[00:14:30.410] - Cara\
And so by asking for help, by delegating, by hiring things out, I freed up a bunch of time and I've made a lot more money. So it works! And now we have a team of four and then a whole bunch of freelancers that work for us, which is incredible. So you're going to go through, I'll show you the second Trello, and you're going to label things that you can delegate. You're going to delegate things that you don't like doing, things you're not good at, things that take you forever, and things that you do just because it allows you to procrastinate.\
\
[00:14:56.210] - Cara\
So let's break this down, OK? I don't like making images. I don't like doing it because I'm not good at it. So I want to delegate those things out. I don't like making sales pages because I'm not good at it. I hate checking my email because I get overwhelmed. Delegate those things out. Now, there are also things that take you forever to do. So like I currently write all the copy for my emails, but I am so ready to hire a copywriter because it takes me a little bit longer than I would like.\
\
[00:15:23.600] - Cara\
And then there are also things that we do that allow us to procrastinate. So I really love planning and so I can't really always delegate all the planning out, but I can delegate some of it out because I will make that my procrastination tool. I have a friend who loves design and so whenever she's procrastinating, she just goes to Canva and makes a whole bunch of Pinterest Pins. And I'm like, well, that's not the most efficient use of your time. But you can find tons of people you can hire out to.\
\
[00:15:49.490] - Cara\
So I've had high school kids work for me from church. They do some of my social media. I have to do photo shoots through me, like, I've had to do a lot of random things. Watch my kids. So you can find high school kids if you have a teenager. And so he's like, download videos for me and things like that. You can find interns at colleges, you can go to onlinejobs.ph, you can hire abroad.\
\
[00:16:09.470] - Cara\
You can also find moms in your local area that are looking for some help. Like, don't feel like "I can't hire out because I don't make the money." You don't make the money because you don't hire out. OK? So think about the ways that you can do it. And also you don't have to delegate everything now? Why don't we create a wish list together? Start to record your processes now so that when you're ready, you know exactly what the job description is, you know what it looks like. I've made this mistake where I've handed, I've hired people with no system in place. And it was a whole mess! And it took us months to finally make a system that worked. And it frustrated them. Right? They were frustrated with it and I was frustrated with them. And it was because we didn't have the system first. So what I want to do is go back into your list. So let's go to Blogs.\
\
[00:16:51.950] - Cara\
And I made a label here in Trello. But again, grab a highlighter, whatever you want to do. This label is called "Can Delegate." And I want you to think, do I have to be the one doing it? If it doesn't have to be me, then it gets a label. So I think I'm going to do...like F4.\
\
[00:17:08.510] - Cara\
So this is a keyboard shortcut on Trello with the labels. Just to show you what I'm going to do real quick if you stick your cursor over this little pencil, you can hit the number four and it'll come up red, which we've already pre-identified is "Can delegate." So I'm going to go through and hit four on anything else. So like, I like to outline my blog post so I know what I'm talking about and I still write them. But could I delegate them?\
\
[00:17:31.190] - Cara\
Maybe. But somebody else could be doing all the research, the editing, the images, the opt-ins. I would need to create the video. Right? That I want to put in there. But somebody can format it. Somebody can schedule social media. Somebody can publish it. Somebody can do the Pinterest. Somebody could add it to our promotion board. Wow! Look where only I need to show up.\
\
[00:17:49.260] - Cara\
Interesting, right? This allows us to see where we don't have to do at all. OK, so we've gone through, we've broken down our tasks. We've written down all the things we need to do. We've done a time inventory. We know how long things are going to take us and we know what we can delegate out.\
\
[00:18:04.950] - Cara\
Hopefully, you now feel like a little more empowered instead of overwhelmed. You're like, "OK, this is a lot. I know, but I know that the future tells me I don't have to be doing all of it and I can make a smarter plan." So it's time to make that smarter plan. Step Two, though, is we've gotta content plan. So you may know all the things you have to do. You've got every single one down, but if you don't create your content plan in advance, you cannot batch in advance.\
\
[00:18:30.630] - Cara\
My goal is always to have next month completed. Before I do this month, I'll even want to look and I'm sorry. Yes, this month completed before next month. So, for example, I'm recording. This is November. I want all of December done before December starts. So this month I want to work on December Podcast December social. All of it! So that in December I can work on January, I can work on projects, I can work on connecting and collaborating.\
\
[00:18:55.410] - Cara\
And I don't have to be in the weeds, writing the blog post that's due tomorrow. We've been there. We've all been there. It's Tuesday night and your podcast goes out on Wednesday. You haven't recorded yet, so you stay up till 2:00 am. Guilty! But, but, but, when we go ahead and we create content plans, smart and batch the planning we can, then batch the do it. Someone laughed at me the other day and they were like, wait, you make a plan to plan.\
\
[00:19:21.540] - Cara\
I was like, "Heck yeah, I do!" So I actually will plan out. Week two of every month is where I batch out my planning for the next month if I haven't already done it. This is where I'm making adjustments and editing, doing what I'm about to show you. Before the quarter starts, I start this planning in advance. So. All right, let's jump over. Ok. This is a content plan. I'm just going to show you one.\
\
[00:19:43.560] - Cara\
I took a picture of it, but I actually opened it in Drive. So we're just going to look at it together. And I've made you a blank so you can take it too. All right, let's look. This is an example of a blanket Content plan. It's simply a Google Sheet, not a big deal, but I do this. So this is for Q1. I created mine and I started it at the beginning of October so that was literally, like, right when the quarter started - I start to plan. And what I do is I take an hour every Monday to just plan and work on this stuff. It takes me probably a whole month to plan it. Well, in doing it this way, then a whole other month to, like, start to batch it and then start to get it done so I can get ahead. So here is a finished product and then I'll walk you through from the beginning.\
\
[00:20:30.420] - Cara\
I just wanted you to see the blank. And now this is my finished product. This is my actual content plan for the quarter. So we've got our dates here. We've got our promotions and our launches here. We got weekly themes, freebie midroll if you have a Podcast, and then I do a Live on Monday and newsletter Tuesday, some social media posts, and a podcast. OK? You might stick a blog in here, whatever it is.\
\
[00:20:52.790] - Cara\
So here's how we start. We're going to work vertically and not horizontally this time around, because when you work vertically up and down like this, you can easily just come up with ideas compared to having to go across and be like, "Oh, what fits this theme?" So first things first, drop your dates in. Second thing, what is the promotion that you were doing that week, and what is your lunch? So I do each quarter. I do like a big product launch for my own product.\
\
[00:21:19.040] - Cara\
Then I do a small launch for maybe a Masterclass I'm teaching or a JV that I'm doing with someone else. And then I do an affiliate or a partnership. So I tend to have about three big things. Now, this January, you can see there's been a little crazy. I've got like a million things going on here, so there's a lot happening. And again, this is my actual content plan. So if you want to hang with me for any of these things, this is what we're doing.\
\
[00:21:40.940] - Cara\
OK, so I go ahead and say, "What's my promotion?" OK, so I had literally a different Summit or a JV or an affiliate each week. Then as you can see here, I've got some blank space. I'm not promoting anything, so I just highlight it. I've got a beta course coming out. I'm doing a flash sale. There's a bundle. OK, so I've got all these things. So I start here with, like, what am I promoting?\
\
[00:22:01.280] - Cara\
What's happening? This way I can theme my weeks. I do that first. Once I've come up with that, then I go to the themes and I go from top to bottom. What am I want my theme to be? This is my message. This is my runway. This is where I'm going to have all my content around that. So week one, I'm talking about Action Planning for Your Goals. So let's, here we go. Let's look at an example for the Blogger Breakthrough Summit, right? My theme was Mompreneur Routines. Now you can see that because of my promotions, Genius Bloggers Toolkit, Blogger's Breakthrough, and my beta, which is a system of course for Mompreneurs, I've got four weeks where my theme is just Routines for Mompreneurs, Routines for Mompreneurs. Once you've got that, you move to the next one. So if you Podcast what freebie pre-role/mid-role makes sense here. So I was promoting the Summit, I was doing a few that made sense.\
\
[00:22:49.940] - Cara\
Let's see if I have a weekly checklist. If I have a webinar, I made them all in advance. Now the reason I make them all in advance and I write them all down now is so that when it's time to batch out my Podcast mid-roles, I can take one day. I already know my entire quarter worth of mid-roles and I can just bang, bang, bang, record, record, record. And I can record every single mid-role I need for the entire quarter and then it's done! And then I can batch them out.\
\
[00:23:19.610] - Cara\
If you don't do this step, if you think, "Cool, Cara. I'm just going to sit and batch. I'm just going to record my Podcast mid-roles on Thursday morning. But you don't do this planning. You're going to waste so much time because you don't know what you're supposed to be recording. I literally can sit down at my mic, record all of these, have all my links together. Boom! Done! All right. So let's walk through kinda the rest of it.\
\
[00:23:42.770] - Cara\
This is just how I break my week out based on my themes, I do a Live on Facebook every single Monday that connects to my weekly theme. So, again, I'm going to go through and I'm going to write them all down. What are my weekly themes? How does it all fit? OK, so if I'm doing Trello for three weeks, talk about tracking goals with Trello, how to use it as a calendar, where to start when it comes to your goals. All connecting to Trello.\
\
[00:24:02.990] - Cara\
OK, this is easier to think of ideas than going across. Now, on Tuesdays, I send like a newsletter or an email. Now, one of the things I actually do is I repurpose some newsletters. So if it's linked here, I literally just link from ConvertKit into here and I just link the, what's it called...? The actual email from ConvertKit so I can open it up and just use that one. So I've got some emails that have performed well.\
\
[00:24:27.080] - Cara\
I just relink at them and then I come up with what I'm going to talk about. So again, when it's time to batch my emails, I'm not sitting at the computer saying, "I need to write Tuesday's email. I said that I was going to write Tuesday's emails today, so I've got to write all of them for the next month. But I haven't planned what I want to write, so I'm going to waste all this time." After you come up with the system we talked about in Trello, you've got to do the batching.\
\
[00:24:49.880] - Cara\
You've got to batch out your content plan for the quarter or you're wasting time.\
\
[00:24:54.380] - Cara\
Now, other things I do then is I've got podcast episodes so I batch those in advance, they all fit my theme and then I batch out my social media. So two times a week, I do like a value-packed...What's it called? Like a, you know, teaching type of a social media, an infographic, whatever. Two times a week is like a personal lifestyle story, all connected to my theme. OK? So I will even back to those out I will write all of them at once so that they're all done and ready to go.\
\
[00:25:19.340] - Cara\
I hope that made sense on how it works. Again, this is where it ends, but this is where it starts. So take some time. Batch out! Write all your promotions down one day. On Monday, I'm going to pick all my promotions. On Tuesday, I'm going to do all my weekly themes. On Wednesday, I'm going to do this. So by the end of the week, you've got your whole content plan done for the whole quarter, and then the next week you can start working on it.\
\
[00:25:41.510] - Cara\
Then the next week, you can move from planning mode to doing mode. You can start recording the freebies. You can start doing the SEO for the blog posts. You can break it down. That's how you get caught up. That's how you get it done in advance. It's getting heated over here. OK, so we've talked a lot about this. I'm sure I have other things on my slides that I didn't talk about.\
\
[00:25:57.160] - Cara\
Hold on, let's scroll on down. Yep, cool. Talked about all that. Pre-assigning our content plan. Boop! Back to Trello. So once you've come up with your content plan and you know all the things you have to do, I then recommend you kind of pre-assign when you're going to do it. So here are some examples. Over here, I've created these little headers in Trello, which all you have to do to do that is click on the card, hit cover, pick a cover that you like, and hit the big side with the little lines over here and then you see it looks like a little cover and then you could put cards underneath it. So that's just a little Trello tip. Take it and run with it. And now what we're going to do is we're gonna batch out your advance work. So maybe this is where like. OK, the third week of every month is a planning week for me, where I'm going to plan out stuff so I can make sure everything's in line. So I'm going to make a card right here and I'm gonna call it Planning Batch.\
\
[00:26:50.910] - Cara\
So I know that in week three of the month, I'm planning. Week one of the month, I'm creating. This is where I'm doing the blog post writing, the Podcast recording, all of those things. And maybe I'm also Podcast batching. So you put those together. Week two of the month, I'm going to do email batching. So I'm going to make a plan so that I can write next month's emails and then the next month's emails, and the next month's emails. And then they're done and you don't got to worry about it!\
\
[00:27:14.850] - Cara\
And maybe, you can see here Podcast Batching. Obviously, it's not going to get done one week of the month. So you can say I'm going to do a little here, a little here. Maybe on week three, I do my social media. So that's when I write all my Instagram posts for the month. That's when I plan out what my Facebook group is going to be and I hand that over to my VA and she schedules it all for me. Maybe week four, you're doing admin.\
\
[00:27:34.470] - Cara\
So we've got all these other things, right? We've got a blog post and research and video. How is that going to look for you? So I want you to go in and I want you to stay, "Out of the month, what am I going to be working on in, what weeks?" Now, you can do this because you have a content plan because you know the end goal so you can fill in the gaps. So you can start with saying, "I know that by the end of December, I want all of January Podcast done."\
\
[00:27:59.580] - Cara\
Right? So that means that I need to work on the Podcast stuff. So I need to make sure Podcasting goes in those first two weeks so that the last two weeks of the month, I'm not worrying about Podcast. Right? And it makes sense, right? You want your Podcast done for the next month so that you can work on the social media for the next month, so you can work on the images for the next month. You can't do it in any other order.\
\
[00:28:21.210] - Cara\
All right. So once we kind of preassigned those, the next one is how do you can create your time blocks so that you can group your tasks together and not like toggle through the day? We're gonna talk about how you can create an ideal time block to work on. And then one of the things I do, and for the parents out there, is I have a list called "Things I can do with my kids around," so that I can maximize my moments when my kids are around and I don't want to get frustrated at them because I'm trying to work. Alright, be flexible as we create them and figure them out. Let's look at them in Trello. OK, come on over to my time blocks. Again, if you copy this template, you will have this whole thing for you. All right? So there's one up here, that's the cover. This is where I've got all of your daily tasks, things that you do every day and you're not sure, like, when you're going to do them.\
\
[00:29:11.000] - Cara\
This is your "things I can do when my kids are around." Maybe you do your manual pinning and see how it's got the time inventory? So I know how long it's going to take. Sometimes we'll say to ourselves, "Oh, Cara, you don't have enough time to do it, like, your kids are playing right now, but you don't have time to do any work because we can't sit and get into the deep work." It's OK to not always be in the deep work, because sometimes we have to deal with the other stuff too, so by pre-identifying how long something's going to take, and I'm like, "All right. I know my kids can play outside for like 15 minutes before, like, they need me, so I'm going to get started on the 15 minute task right now."\
\
[00:29:44.100] - Cara\
So I'm not overwhelmed. And so because I've done the time block, I know how long it takes. I, therefore, can decide which tasks to do instead of complaining about not having enough time, we waste more time complaining about not having enough time than actually doing the things, right? So these are the daily ones. But let's go down to the time blocks. OK, so a few things that I recommend you do. One is that you create whatever your time blocks are.\
\
[00:30:08.180] - Cara\
So let's say, Monday I'm going to work on my emails. Actually, I don't think I want to click on that yet. Monday is when I work on my emails, Tuesdays when I work on my membership, Thursdays when I work on my Podcast, OK? And so I've got them all kind of written down here. Now, inside each of these cards is where I go ahead and I write down what's going to happen when. So there's a few ways you can do this.\
\
[00:30:31.540] - Cara\
You can make a checklist, you can call your checklist whatever you want. So I've called it 5-9, 9-12, 12-3, 4-8, and 8-11. This is my whole day. So this is what every Monday looks like for me. And I've said on Mondays, I work primarily on my emails. So "ideal world," five to nine a.m., that's my, say 5-9 is my work time and 9-12 is my work time.\
\
[00:30:56.690] - Cara\
So let's say my kids are going outside of the home to school or whatever it is. You can see I've got things written here. I don't have anything written during the day because say I pick my kids up at 12 pm and then they go to bed at 8 pm. So I don't work then, so this does not have any work in here. It's just empty. So I've said, on Monday I'm going to do my emails and I plan out in advance-\
\
[00:31:16.210] - Cara\
What am I doing? I'm working on newsletter one, newsletter two, and newsletter three. I've already got it here and it's got these great checkboxes in Trello so I can track my work. The other thing I might say is, "OK, now I know this is quiet time, so it's actually not hard for me to write these emails because my kids are still sleeping." They're doing quiet stuff, whatever it is. Now from 9-12, maybe it's a little louder, I'm doing something different.\
\
[00:31:36.910] - Cara\
So from 9-12, that's when I can work on maybe different newsletters. Well, we already have newsletters up here. So I'll show you, if you hit those three dots, you can just delete things. But maybe from 9-12, I said I'm going to work on my Podcast promo email because it doesn't take as much brain space because it's already kind of written for my show notes. I'm going to work on any sales emails. I've got it planned out so I know what my day looks like.\
\
[00:31:55.270] - Cara\
So my recommendation to you is going to be to kind of go into any of the blocks, say what you're going to be working on. Say, "This is when I work on my membership on Tuesdays." Which is actually what mine looks like. And I will show you guys in real-time, don't judge it, my actual Trello board when we're done. So this is my membership. Maybe on Tuesdays I have a mother's helper, so I know I can get some quiet work done.\
\
[00:32:16.000] - Cara\
So from 9-12, this is what I like film videos because that's my ideal work time. This is when I do like lives in student groups. Okay? Things like that. But maybe in the morning or this time it's not so quiet. So, that's when I engage in Facebook groups, etc.. OK? So I want you to go ahead, go to those blocks we've created because you've done all the work. You know exactly what has to get done and drop them in.\
\
[00:32:41.530] - Cara\
When are you going to do those things? This allows you to know when something's going to happen and where it's going to happen. And when you pre-plan like this, you can kind of pivot, as needed.\
\
[00:32:51.700] - Cara\
Now, this next pillar is pre-planning out your tasks and I recommend you do this before the start of the month because once done everything else, you kind of have a sense of what has to happen. OK, I write a newsletter every Tuesday.\
\
[00:33:07.480] - Cara\
I need to write this one, this one, this one, and this one. Right? I need to do this social media. This will let you eliminate your procrastination because you know exactly what needs to get done and what else gets pushed off. You're like, oh, no, I can't get behind on these things. OK, so this is an example of what the card looks like in Trello. So, for example, if I was to do email, I would make three different checklist.\
\
[00:33:27.970] - Cara\
One would be, "What do I need to complete this week? What do I need to complete this month?" And one is, "What I've already done?" So I do this the, I guess it's the fourth week. So maybe like the Monday before the week starts, I sit in Trello and I make these cards and I feel like I have an example of these...\
\
[00:33:46.260] - Cara\
You know what I'm going to do? Audible! Come on in. I'm going to have you come into my Trello. I'm going to show you my real board, no judge. And I'm going to show you what it looks like for me because I thought I had an example here, but I'm not seeing it, so we're just going to do it in real life and I'll show you what it looks like.\
\
[00:34:03.700] - Cara\
OK, so this is inside my Goal Trello board. This is my personal life and my regular life. So we're going to scroll on down to the regular stuff. Here we go. OK, so this is this week. Nope, that's not this week. This is this week. So I'm going to go all the way down. OK, so here's what I have.\
\
[00:34:22.190] - Cara\
These are my work batches. OK, focus. On Monday, I do my emails. On Tuesdays, do my club and my coaching. Wednesday, they work on launches. Thursdays, I work on Podcast, social media, and team. And Fridays, I work on projects. OK, so this is my email list for the entire month. I've got three lists: to complete this week, to complete this month, and what I've completed. Now, it's the beginning of the month, so I haven't done anything yet because I don't add any of this 'till the end of the week.\
\
[00:34:47.180] - Cara\
But before the month began, I brain dumped every newsletter. And you can see I'm behind. Like, I like for December, for November to be done, but it's not.\
\
[00:34:55.450] - Cara\
I'm going to be real with you! So I'm behind, but my goal is always to get ahead. And so I have gone through and I've broken down every email I need to write for December because again, this is my emails, emails, student emails, call emails, prep emails, all of it. And then on Sundays or Saturdays, actually, I move anything that I want done for the week and I move it up here. And then I also add in things. Like doing the budget and the data review doesn't fit under emails, but I didn't do it on Sunday, so I just had to kind of add another item in if that makes sense. So you can always move things up.\
\
[00:35:25.820] - Cara\
So this is what it looks like at the end of the month. I'm going to drag this up so it's easier. So at the end of the week, I'll take anything that I did and I'll put it up here and I will congratulate myself like "You go, girl! So proud of you. Can't believe you got those emails up. Nice work!" You gotta love on yourself. And I move it here, I see what's left, and then I ask myself, "Well what needs to complete it next week?"\
\
[00:35:49.850] - Cara\
And then I drop those bad boys up here. So now I know exactly what I'm working on next week. So when it's time to write the emails and I know that in the morning is the best time to write my newsletter email, boom! I open this up and I just start working. I'm not thinking about it. I'm just doing it. And I'm starting with the end in mind. So this is kind of like that final step that pulls it all together because we've done...Man, did we talk about a lot?! Right? Like a lot today. All right. But just to reiterate our steps by going in through, going through, and brain dumping first, you've got your vision, then go to the baseline, do your time inventory and then say, "Hey, what can I delegate? What can I get out of here? I know where I'm at." And then you're going to go through and pause. You're going to make your content plan.\
\
[00:36:35.150] - Cara\
You're going to fill it in. So you know exactly which emails, exactly what social. Exactly, exactly what has to get done. Then you're going to pop back into this bad boy and you are going to make your batches. You're going to make your time blocks. You put everything together, you're going to have it be crystal clear when it's time for you to sit down and work. This is what you're doing when you're doing it. No decision fatigue.\
\
[00:36:55.760] - Cara\
Just get started. So let's all take a deep breath. All right. I'm ready too. And I would love to encourage you to do this time inventory, add in the tasks you can delegate, make your content plan, and batch. Here's my pro tip: 15 minutes a day. Put in 15 minutes a day, every single day to work on this planning piece, because if every day you're doing some sort of planning, then that's how you get ahead. You can't just say, "It's November the 30th and I want December's plan 100% done." Because you're going to start December 1st, be like, "Um, I don't know what I'm doing. I'll just try again next month." It happens. Start now. Fifteen minutes a day. Just brain dump and move baby steps. OK?\
\
[00:37:39.560] - Cara\
This was really fun to connect today. Like I said, I know I went very fast and I talk very fast and hopefully, you can get the recording of this and I'll make sure all these links are here.\
\
[00:37:48.530] - Cara\
But I want to connect. So head over to apurposedrivenmom on Instagram. DM me! Tell me your biggest aha moment, the biggest action step, and take away that you're going to do today. Better bonus - do it after you do it, right? Like watch it, bring dump one of your batches, and then DM and say that you did it. OK, I want to voice back and forth if you've got Trello questions I can show you a little video.\
\
[00:38:10.670] - Cara\
I am committed to helping you make this the best. I just want to give you another free gift. I feel like I've put a few in the Summit, but I have a free workshop.

Hello and welcome to this session on how to use batch planning to get your content completed faster. I'm Cara Harvey, and we are going to dive into a way that I hope will help you be working smarter and not harder. I know what it's like to try to get your blog, your website, your business up and running and feel like you're spinning your wheels trying to do everything. And this batch method I'm going to teach you today I think is going to be your shortcut to success when you have a million things on your plate as a business owner. Before I jump in, I'm going to let you know something.\
\
[00:00:42.120] - Cara\
I talk fast, so if you want to get a replay, pause, however, you want to do that to hang out with me today, make sure you access that pass because I'm going to throw a lot of information at you and I want to make sure that you leave with tons of value. But, yeah, I talk pretty fast and I want to make sure we get through it all. So, there's your warning. Let's dive in. We are going to cover a bunch of stuff today.\
\
[00:01:03.700] - Cara\
First, we're going to talk about how a batch system works and how to start creating it. We're also going to talk about why you need this to figure out what to work on when and decrease the overwhelm. I'm going to show you how mapping out a content plan is going to help you easily batch all of your tasks. A blog, a YouTube, a podcast, whatever you want to do, and how to start delegating and asking for help to make this work too. So, if this sounds like you, I want to let you know this is the session you need to be watching today.\
\
[00:01:33.270] - Cara\
Right? Do you ever say these things? I sit down to work and I just do not know what to do or my life is so busy, how am I supposed to find the time to get it done? Or maybe this one. I feel like I'm busy, but I'm not getting anything actually accomplished.\
\
[00:01:46.870] - Cara\
You ever get to the end of the day and you just throw your hands up? Like, what are we even doing? Maybe you said, I want to work on my business, I want to make progress in my home, but I'm just overwhelmed and everything is a struggle. I work from home. I have three kids.\
\
[00:01:58.840] - Cara\
My kids are goodness. Six, no, five, seven and 16. And I also know what it's like to try to manage all the things while the dishes are staring at me in the other room and the laundry is begging to be folded. Maybe you're asking yourself, how am I supposed to find time to work when everything else is loaded on your plate? Or you just want to give up and you don't feel like you can make this business work.\
\
[00:02:19.200] - Cara\
If you've ever said or recently said any of those things. Friend, I'm happy you're here to hang out with me because I'm Cara Harvey and I help overwhelmed. Specifically, I work with work-at-home moms, but anybody can take my tips. But I help overwhelm work-at-home moms find the time and make action plans to grow and scale their business without hustle, without shame and without overwhelm.\
\
[00:02:39.630] - Cara\
I'm going to clip notes my story because, honestly, you're not here to learn about me. But I want you to know that I've been there. I've been in your shoes and I completely understand what it's like. I started my business a little over five years ago as an accidental entrepreneur, and I threw the proverbial spaghetti at a wall trying to figure out what the heck to do. And it wasn't until I niche into productivity and I found my secret sauce in this, what we call priority based productivity and this anti-shame based approach to productivity.\
\
[00:03:07.470] - Cara\
Because everything out there is like hustle culture. If you don't want it bad enough, you got to try, sacrifice your sleep, blah, blah, garbage. I decided to do something that was the opposite of that. And when I found that and I started to use my own systems, things took off for me. I was able to go from barely making any money, trying to figure out how to run a business to someone who now has a team of seven.\
\
[00:03:28.000] - Cara\
I run a rated top 100 podcast called The Purpose Driven Mom Show with over 380,000 downloads and counting. And I'm the author of the book the 15 Minutes Formula how busy mom can ditch the guilt, say yes to what matters and conquer their goals. And I was able to do both of these things and help over 3000 women in my program by using the system I'm going to talk to you about today. So, whether you're just starting out or you're looking to amplify your currently growing business, I hope you can gleam some nuggets that you can take with you. Now, on a scale of one to ten, I want you to think about this.\
\
[00:04:00.600] - Cara\
How efficient would you say you are right now with managing your time and managing your business? Are you a one, hot mess? I don't know what I'm doing. I'm just getting started and I feel like I sit down and have zero clue what to do. Are you a ten?\
\
[00:04:13.690] - Cara\
Like carrot? Get out the seat. Let me teach this class, right? Or are you like a five? Like, some days, it works, some days, it doesn't, help me out.\
\
[00:04:21.880] - Cara\
I want you to think about this because my goal for you is to be able to take it a step further. My goal for you is to be able to say, this is where I'm at. And now I've got some systems and tips because I'm going to toss a lot at you today that I can take and I can amplify it a little bit. So let's talk about the pillars of batching. Our first pillar is about premapping a content plan.\
\
[00:04:41.910] - Cara\
We're going to talk about that. We're then going to talk about how to categorize your tasks to make you, again, work smarter, not harder. We're going to talk about creating time blocks and how you're going to work ahead. And pre planning key here, pre planning things out. So, when it's time to actually sit at your desk or your standing treadmill or your kitchen table or your bedroom or wherever you're working at the moment, you know what to do.\
\
[00:05:03.960] - Cara\
And you're not sitting there wasting the time thinking, what am I supposed to be doing? Does that ever happen to you? You're like, yes, my kid's napping, I've got an hour. What the heck am I supposed to be doing? Because everything feels urgent, we are going to answer all those questions.\
\
[00:05:18.090] - Cara\
So, let's start with pillar one, premapping a content plan. I highly encourage you to make a content plan for your pillar content. And when I'm talking about pillar content, this could be a blog, it could be a podcast, it could be a YouTube channel. What is your main way that you're providing value, bringing it out to the people and the people are finding you, whatever that is, you want to have a content plan.\
\
[00:05:39.750] - Cara\
Content planning is going to help you be more focused on what you're doing and why. It's also going to help you fill in gaps with your batching because what it's allowing you to do is look at the vision. And I know it can feel scary and hard to look 5, 12, 14 weeks into the future, but I promise you when you start to get this method going, you save so much time. This is going to help you create your schedules based on the next four to twelve weeks. If you don't know where you're going, then it's very hard to make an action plan around your work.\
\
[00:06:10.740] - Cara\
So, I actually want to show you yeah, I'm going to show you this, but I'm going to show you a blank one in a second. Actually, let's start with a blank one. Hold on, I think I have a copy of it here. Yes. Perfect.\
\
[00:06:19.620] - Cara\
And I'm going to send these over, so you can access this as well. This is my blanket content mapping schedule. And what I do at the start of the quarter is, or not the start of the quarter, maybe a couple of weeks before the quarter begins because I want to get ahead is I sit down and I ask myself, what am I promoting and when? The first thing you're going to want to do here is fill in the weeks, like week of, you know, like 1/1/2023, whatever you want to do. You're going to put the week here.\
\
[00:06:44.970] - Cara\
You're then going to fill all the weeks and you're going to work vertically and not horizontally. We want to fill it horizontally because that makes sense, right? I should just fill in the whole list for the week. Friend I want you to go vertically because that's how our brains work better. And what you're going to do is you're going to say like, okay, so January 1, January 8.\
\
[00:07:05.160] - Cara\
I don't have a calendar in front of me, so I don't actually know when the weeks start. But you're going to go vertically. Okay. Batch those out. Cool.\
\
[00:07:11.220] - Cara\
Pat yourself in the back. You got your twelve weeks listed. What you're then going to do is go to the next column. Then you're going to ask yourself what are promotions or launches happening then? So, maybe there's a summit you're speaking out. Maybe you're launching your product. Maybe you have a freebie you want to push or an ebook or something that's a flash sale, an affiliate promotion. You're going to fill what that is in first and again, work up and down, work vertically. And I want you to think about the next twelve weeks.\
\
[00:07:37.210] - Cara\
And you don't have to fill it in. This isn't one of those where you have to fill every box in. But if you have a promotion or a launch, you want it. Why? Because you've got to work backwards to make a content plan.\
\
[00:07:47.310] - Cara\
So, you're going to go ahead and go this way and you're going to say like, I've got a launch here and maybe in this week, I've got this affiliate promo or whatever it is. So, you have the information. The next column, again, vertical, not horizontal, you're going to work on is the freebie push. So, is there a freebie that you're going to focus on sending people to that fits in with your launch? So, if I'm launching something, I work on time management for work at home moms, right?\
\
[00:08:10.650] - Cara\
So, maybe I'm launching my membership, the purpose of a mom club. So, if I know that that's happening, I might be pushing like six weeks before that, eight weeks before that, I'm pushing people to my freebie. So, I'm going to say, what's a freebie that sets people up for success when it comes to my program? And I'm going to write the freebie.\
\
[00:08:26.920] - Cara\
And so I've got a weekly checklist here. Maybe I have a social media planner that fits really nicely here with my affiliate promotion. Because you always want to be growing your email list. Okay. Now I think if you put on a 15 minutes timer, you can potentially get these four even.\
\
[00:08:44.610] - Cara\
I'll talk about in a second, columns done in 15 minutes. And you can have your twelve weeks planned. I use a 15 minutes concept because sometimes that's all we have. But our brains can do a lot in 15 minutes and we play beat the clock. So, then you're going to fill your theme.\
\
[00:08:57.220] - Cara\
This is like, say I'm doing an affiliate promotion and it's on like reels or something. Maybe it's somebody else is sharing a reels mini course that aligns for my audience. Cool. So, I'm going to push my social media planner because that fits. And my theme this week might be like Instagram, I don't know, content. So, then all the things I'm going to do are going to align around instagram content that fit my niche. So, I'm going to come up with my themes again vertically. Once you've done that first part, take a break, walk away, take a step, come back. And then you're going to start working vertically again.\
\
[00:09:30.240] - Cara\
And fill the other columns out. Now across the top. This is my suggested framework. You don't have to use it. Mondays to do a Facebook Live. Tuesdays, maybe send a newsletter.\
\
[00:09:39.820] - Cara\
Wednesdays, a post on social media. It's like a value post. Thursdays my podcast comes out. Friday is a personal post on social media. Saturday is a value based post and Sunday is a blog post.\
\
[00:09:49.680] - Cara\
Alright, change it up however you want. Come up with what you're going to do every day. And the end goal is, how do I get it to all lead into my launch? How do I get it to all lead into what I'm trying to sell? Because you're trying to make some money.\
\
[00:10:02.880] - Cara\
So, what you're going to do then is work vertically. I know I keep saying it because it will make more sense. So, if I'm sitting here and I'm like, cool, I'm going to do some Facebook lives. I have all my themes identified. My brain can easily bang out a whole bunch of twelve ideas on what I could do for Facebook lives, right?\
\
[00:10:20.950] - Cara\
I could just say, oh cool, I'm doing it, work at home mom time management tips is what I teach, right? So I could talk about content planning, I could talk about batching. I could do a live on tips for working from home when your kids are sick. My brain will likes that.\
\
[00:10:33.900] - Cara\
Then you move to the next column. In the next column, if you put a 15 minutes timer on maybe three blocks, you could probably do this whole first section in 15 minutes. You probably do the second section in 15 minutes. And this third section, that's 45 minutes. And you can get twelve weeks planned out.\
\
[00:10:48.880] - Cara\
Doesn't that feel amazing? So, this is what it looks like and it's kind of all completed. You can see here, I've got the weeks here. I've got what my promo is, what my freebie is, my theme. Now this theme I will say this screenshot is from when I was a lifestyle blogger.\
\
[00:11:02.920] - Cara\
I don't recommend doing that like super niche down friends. But this is when I had so many things I was talking about. But this is what it looked like in the beginning. So, it might look like that for you. I have my lives planned out, my value posts.\
\
[00:11:16.630] - Cara\
I even had a blog post connected to the social media. So, I linked that here to make it easy what everything was. And having this allowed me to batch ahead because I knew where I was going. I knew what the next couple of weeks were going to look like and I knew this is the stuff I needed to create. In less than an hour, you can make a content plan for your next twelve weeks. I promise you. You are very capable of doing it. But you want to work vertically. Okay, that's going to be cute.\
\
[00:11:44.230] - Cara\
And I'll make sure I send this link over if you want to get access to that blank planner I have. But you can use anything. Now that is step one. Content plan. Content plan.\
\
[00:11:52.620] - Cara\
Content plan. All right, take a breath, right? You can do it. Now let's move to the second step. Now we're going to talk about how to create your batch categories.\
\
[00:12:00.570] - Cara\
Now batching is essentially doing similar tasks together, right? It's taking those things, putting them together, so that you don't have to have a million tabs up. If I'm making images in Canva, it does not make sense for me to be like, cool, I'm gonna work on one podcast episode. So, let me pull up one image in Canva and then tomorrow let me pull up Canva again for my one image. Our brains don't want to work like that.\
\
[00:12:22.230] - Cara\
When you can batch, you can make a template. You can do it so much faster. So, two ways to batch is either by the task images or by the content pillar, YouTube. So if like, for example, I have a podcast day, that's my one batch day. So on that day, all I work on is podcast stuff.\
\
[00:12:39.610] - Cara\
Typically, for my podcast now I just record. I have a team that does a lot of the other stuff, but I still need to outline and plan. So, the way I structure it is I have, it's kind of meta, right? But on Wednesdays it's podcast day. I have opened my schedule from twelve to three for interviews.\
\
[00:12:58.710] - Cara\
Okay? So that's like where I interview people or I record podcasts or I get interviewed. Like that's my one time. So, from nine to twelve, which is my first time block, that's when I start batching by task. So I will spend some time from nine to twelve outlining episodes, I will outline all twelve weeks, for example, or all four weeks.\
\
[00:13:21.540] - Cara\
I also spend that time maybe reviewing data. I might spend that time I don't make my images now. But you could spend that time making your images. You could spend that time editing. So, I kind of batch inside of a batch.\
\
[00:13:31.780] - Cara\
Super meta, super fun. But it's essentially grouping your tasks together. All right, so here's an example of how to make batch categories if you used a blog. I want you to make a list of everything you do in your business and all the tasks it takes to get them done. I'm going to show you an example on Trello in a minute.\
\
[00:13:48.180] - Cara\
Trello is a free tool. I will give you this Trello board as well if you want me to do some of the thinking for you. But I want you to go ahead and say, hey, what is my content pillar blog post? What are all the things that has to happen for me to get it done? This is how you start to learn how to create your batches.\
\
[00:14:03.270] - Cara\
So, you got to do your SEO and you got to outline, you got to find affiliates, imaging, formatting, writing, the email, social media, write it all down first because when you write it down, you're going to use this data to create a schedule. So, this is a Trello board here. I'm going to give you this where I've done the work for you. But I wanted to teach off Trello for this session in case you were like, Trello's scary, it's fun. This is a really great way to plan.\
\
[00:14:26.040] - Cara\
So, here is my blog flow, right? I have exactly what has to happen if I have a podcast. This is everything that has to happen to put one podcast out. Everything that has to happen for social media, everything for images, emails. I have a list here for YouTube and you can keep going, right?\
\
[00:14:43.630] - Cara\
There's admin work, creation, research, Twitter, coaching. I don't know, there's tons of stuff you do. Make a list for everything you do and have a big list, so that we can then categorize. But the first thing is, now that I know my content plan, I know I'm going to do YouTube, I know I'm going to do podcast, I know I'm going to do social media, social media. Then all I have to do is say what has to happen to make it go from idea to finished.\
\
[00:15:09.490] - Cara\
Now, here's the thing I also want you to do. I want you to start broad, but I want you to then get specific. So, don't write down in your batch plan, outline all blog posts. All right? So, step one, I guess two point A is these big posts here, this like images, opt-ins videos, right?\
\
[00:15:34.180] - Cara\
That's kind of step one. That's your general batching. But the second thing that you're going to need to do if you are looking at the next four to twelve weeks and you're trying to get ahead, is I want you to be super specific.\
\
[00:15:49.240] - Cara\
Hold on, I had it in one of these cards here I wanted to pull up for you.\
\
[00:15:54.560] - Cara\
Oh, here we go. So that's over here. So, for example, what you're going to do is you're not going to write a newsletter. You're going to say newsletter January week one, newsletter January week two, newsletter January week three. Be very specific about what has to happen.\
\
[00:16:11.820] - Cara\
And because you've made your beautiful content plan, you already know what it is. All right? And I'm going to show you the rest of these later. So, here's an example here. So, for your membership.\
\
[00:16:22.840] - Cara\
You're not going to say, oh, I'm going to work on everything for my membership. I need to film these videos. I need to go live in the group. What does that actually look like? Be very specific because this will be overwhelming proof.\
\
[00:16:34.500] - Cara\
When you go to sit down to work, you can be like, oh, I know exactly what I have to do, because it's not that I have to do every blog post if I have to outline this one blog post. All right. So, you're going to batch out and start with your main list of the tasks you want to do. And then we'll get even more specific. Now, when you're ready to plan your time blocks, like I mentioned, I have a podcast day, etc. There's a couple of things I suggest you do.\
\
[00:16:58.740] - Cara\
One is start with the time inventory. This is where you're going to write down everything. Everything that you get done, how long it takes. This is because we either over or underestimate how long something is going to take. And what I recommend that you do is you take three to five days, typical days for you, and you can guesstimate.\
\
[00:17:16.080] - Cara\
You can use a piece of paper, your phone app. I'm going to show you how to do it on a trello and just write down how long things take. Now, this is going to do a couple of things. This is going to help you figure out how to group things together, right? If you notice when you're doing a blog post that you open, you know, Ubersuggest four different times during one blog post to look at SEO stuff or find your title or whatever it is, okay, this tells me I want to group this task together because I keep opening it up.\
\
[00:17:47.590] - Cara\
This also is going to help you see, like, your best zone of genius. I do not like to record after like 01:00 in the afternoon. My brain is kind of done. So, by two, my kids are a traditional school, so I work pretty much between 9:30 and three. And at 2 'o' clock, I'm pretty done for the day.\
\
[00:18:06.480] - Cara\
I've noticed that 2 'o' clock is not my best time. My prime zone of genius time is ten to twelve. So, I know right now that's what I'm recording the presentation, it's ten or nine, right? I know that if I want to get my best work done for things like filming, the things that need my most energy, I try to do it then. Now, you might notice that you're recording podcasts every day or something like that.\
\
[00:18:30.100] - Cara\
And some days you do it in the morning, some days at night. And you realize that when you do it at night, it takes you so much longer because you're exhausted. Or maybe you try to do it during the morning, but your kids are home because you're homeschooling, and that takes you longer because of interruptions. This is just going to be like put in a detective hat and say, that's interesting, and make some observations about your time. What it's also going to allow you to do is fill in the gaps of your workflows, so that you can know they're completed and you can guess.\
\
[00:18:55.680] - Cara\
So, here's the thing about the trello board. Let me show you this inside trello. What you can do is you can put the times in here. So what if, for example, you were like, I'm going to do a time inventory of my blog flow. I already brain dumped all the tasks that I think I need to do to get one blog post done.\
\
[00:19:13.210] - Cara\
But today, I'm going to time inventory. So I'm going to go in here and I'm going to say, okay, it took me 60 minutes or however long it took. And again, guesstimate we're not trying for perfection here. But then what if you get to the next section and you realize, oh, I totally forgot that I also do research on my headings. And I didn't write that down in my task, but it's on my inventory.\
\
[00:19:35.200] - Cara\
Well, now you can fill it in here. And now you know the other step. And then you start to see, hey, maybe I can just do my H two research while I'm doing my main keyword research. Like why would I not?\
\
[00:19:45.130] - Cara\
But when I started blogging, I didn't realize that I was literally just going step by step when step by step. It doesn't always make sense when you can batch things together. Again, if you realize you're opening up your tools for SEO research, for keyword research, and then you're outlining, and then it's 2 hours later and you have a post on and you're like, oh, I forgot to do my h two research. That's where your light bulb goes. Wait, these are tasks I should put together.\
\
[00:20:08.010] - Cara\
So, now I know that when I'm doing my keyword research because my tools are open and all the data is there, I don't have to reload everything or open it or whatever. I'll just make sure I pick my H2s when I'm doing it. Now, you might be laughing like duck hair, that makes sense. But when I started blogging, I had no idea that I was like, oh, that does make sense, right?\
\
[00:20:25.200] - Cara\
It's the same thing. I'm doing reels on Instagram. I batch all my videos together because I realized that it was a time saver for me to just open up my camera, set up my ring light, and do all my reels in 1 hour. And then I can get a whole week's worth of reels done and not have to go back and forth thinking about the reel. What am I going to do?\
\
[00:20:41.830] - Cara\
Right? Use your brain smarter, not harder. So, step one, make your content plan. Step two, outline kind of what you think your batches are. Step three is where you're going to do your time inventory.\
\
[00:20:53.140] - Cara\
You're going to plan out your time blocks. You're going to start to see how long things take. And then you're going to ask yourself a couple of questions when it comes to deciding when you're going to work, when is your largest chunk of time, right? What's the creative tasks? I will record podcasts my kids home.\
\
[00:21:08.230] - Cara\
I do not want to, so I know that, like, those are things I want quiet time for. Are there things you can do with your kids around? When I was growing my business, my kids were around if I needed to do something like Pin on Pinterest or make an image on Canva, I can do that in between breaking up the fights and wiping the booties on the potty and pushing somebody on a swing or whatever I'm doing, I can do that. And I can also do it and be interrupted and not annoyed.\
\
[00:21:29.620] - Cara\
For a while, I was trying to write blog posts and I had a two year old at home. Anyone else ever do that? That's a terrible idea. And I was getting very resentful towards my two year old because they needed me and I was trying to write. So, what I did was I switched around how I worked and instead when my kid was awake playing in the other room where I was sitting in the room playing with them, because that was the nature of what we were doing.\
\
[00:21:51.060] - Cara\
And I wasn't writing the blog post. Maybe I was making the images. So, if I was stopping to play with them for a little bit, my thought patterns weren't interrupted. And I was choosing to use nap time to write because I knew that that was when it was my best time. So, I want you to kind of ask yourself, when is your best time to work and what does that look like?\
\
[00:22:09.700] - Cara\
And then here on this time lock suggested schedule, that's the one I kind of pulled up before. But what I do recommend you do nope, not this one. Keep pulling this one up is you go ahead into your cards. That's what these are called or wherever you're planning and you plan out when you're working on what's in that specific, you know newsletter one, newsletter two, newsletter three.\
\
[00:22:30.940] - Cara\
This way you know what to work on in your zone of genius. Now, I teach a whole time blocking system that we do not have time to get into today. So, if you want more help on that, come find me. I have courses and videos and stuff, but essentially you're just going to say between these hours, what are the three things I'm getting done? And this will allow you to plan it out.\
\
[00:22:47.500] - Cara\
Okay. Now I'm going to give you a bonus, setting up your delegation plan now. You don't have to do it all, friend. You should be delegating. Now, you may not be financially in the place to delegate.\
\
[00:22:57.720] - Cara\
I did not hire or delegate anyone for my first year. Then I started hiring some people on like fiverr to do little things for me. And now five years in, there's a team of seven. It's the whole thing and it's really fun.\
\
[00:23:08.680] - Cara\
But in the beginning, I wasn't ready. So, where did I start? I delegated things I didn't enjoy, I wasn't good at, that take me forever. Things that are like my procrastination. Like I hate making images, but my friend loves it and I know that she uses that time to make her image perfect.\
\
[00:23:24.330] - Cara\
And procrastinates doing other things because of that perfectionism, those are things to delegate. You can find tons of people. I hired my 16 year old when he was twelve years old. He was working for me. High school kids, intern, there's online jobs at PH fiver, local area moms that want extra money.\
\
[00:23:40.750] - Cara\
There's so many people who would like to help you, but also know this, you don't have to delegate. Now you make a wish list. So, while you're doing these tasks, while you're in canva making the image, turn on Loom.com, right, and go in and talk about what you're doing. This is how I make an image. This is the way I do it, so that you have a process when you're ready to hire.\
\
[00:24:02.350] - Cara\
The way you can do that on this trello board though, is if you go in here, there's these little labels. So, if we go into a card here and again, this isn't a trello course, but I just wanted to show you how to use it on this board. You go into labels. You can make labels for anything you want. And you can make one that's just called can delegate.\
\
[00:24:18.310] - Cara\
And all I want you to do is go through these lists that you've created and say, what can I not do? When it comes to a blog, all the heck I need to do is write it. And at this point, honestly, I can hire a writer. Like, I really don't need to do anything. All I need to do for my blog is record a podcast and send it to somebody else to record it.\
\
[00:24:34.660] - Cara\
I'm not there yet, but you know what I mean. Like, there's so much you don't have to be doing. So, I just want you to go through and surf your dream a little bit while you're doing this. It's just smart to get ahead. All right, let's go to pillar four because we're in that time here.\
\
[00:24:47.380] - Cara\
But I want you now to start preplanning your task. So, if you've done these other pieces, you have a good sense of like, how I need to get ahead. Now, when you preplan, this is going to give you urgency and it will help you eliminate the procrastination that comes to like, what am I supposed to be doing? So this is what I recommend you do. When it comes to batching, I do teach a twelve week system.\
\
[00:25:08.130] - Cara\
But I know that can feel overwhelming. So, if you're not ready to jump into that, why don't we start with getting you one week ahead. When I was a high school teacher I don't think I share this I was a high school teacher for eight years and one of the things I would do is I would not leave on Fridays until all my copies were made and my stuff was organized and my classroom was set up. Why? Because I did not want to go into Monday like feeling behind.\
\
[00:25:32.760] - Cara\
Because I knew that on Monday, some sort of fire was going to pop up and my time would not be my own. So, I planned for stuff to happen and maybe I lose my prep. Okay. And this principle helps so much. If you can get a week ahead, how good would that feel?\
\
[00:25:48.510] - Cara\
You ever been there where it's like midnight and your podcast episode is due to your podcast editor and you need to send it in and you're up late recording? I don't know, maybe just me, right? That's a terrible feeling. So, I want you to think smaller if that's what you need to wrap your head around it and ask yourself, what do I need to get a week ahead? So, if I'm going in to record reels, I'm going to do what we call a sprint.\
\
[00:26:12.430] - Cara\
And I'm going to record not only this week's reels, but next week's. And then that way, I'm ahead. If you want to make it even smaller, when you go in to record today's reel, can you record two? Can you record today's and tomorrow's? Then tomorrow, you already have tomorrow's done. Still record two, then you record. So, let's pretend it's Monday, right? I go in on Monday. I record Monday's reel and Tuesday's reel.\
\
[00:26:36.300] - Cara\
So now it's Tuesday. Monday's reel is recorded. So I'm going to record Wednesday's reel and Thursday's reel. And I'm going to add a third Friday's reel. So now I'm a couple more days ahead.\
\
[00:26:48.840] - Cara\
I get to Wednesday. Now. I've already got Friday. Done. So now I'm going to do the next week.\
\
[00:26:53.160] - Cara\
I'm going to record Monday's real, Tuesday's reel, Wednesday's reel. And then on Friday, I'm recording Thursday and Friday. If you do that system in just a few extra minutes, you've gotten two weeks done, two weeks ahead, and then you rinse and repeat to grow it. So, don't feel like you have to get twelve weeks ahead is what I'm saying. Make it smaller if you need to.\
\
[00:27:15.510] - Cara\
But what I want you to think of is what are all the tasks that have to get done this month? What do I have to focus on and what needs to be completed? So, this is what it looks like in the trello board. This is what I keep opening. It looks like this.\
\
[00:27:25.830] - Cara\
So, I would go in here and I would say like reels Monday, reels Tuesday. And I would make it super small for myself. Why? Because my brain is overwhelmed anyway. And if I look at my work thing and I say, hey, I just have to do reels for Monday today.\
\
[00:27:42.130] - Cara\
Cool. Then I can check it off. I can feel good and I can have that micro in and I can move forward. So, I want you to really think about what that looks like for you and start to plan and get ahead. This lets you get a couple of steps ahead and think about it.\
\
[00:27:58.950] - Cara\
Now here's what I want to tell you. Whoo. I told you I talk fast. We covered a lot today. I hope this gave you a great overview of how you can start to use batching in your planning to get ahead, to feel better, to grow and scale your business because you deserve it.\
\
[00:28:14.350] - Cara\
The things I'm going to encourage you to work on after this session, and again, don't do them all. Take one to work on. Do a time inventory. If the number one thing that you are like Cara, what should I do first? Do your time inventory because it's going to tell you exactly what you're doing.\
\
[00:28:30.550] - Cara\
Then add in those delegatable tasks. Don't know if that's a real word, but we're going to go with it. Create your content plan and start to organize. If you just do this 15 minutes a day for the next two weeks, you will have the next twelve weeks done, I promise you. And then you'll be ready to jump in and start working.\
\
[00:28:45.560] - Cara\

Cara Harvey [00:00:12]:\
My name is Cara Harvey, and I am excited to welcome you to my session on goal driven entrepreneurship today. If we've never met before, hey. Nice to meet you. Thanks for hanging out. I'm gonna let you know I talk pretty fast. So if you can pause me, pause me. If you have access to an upgrade, you're gonna wanna get it and you're gonna wanna take notes because I'm gonna give you so many good tips on starting, growing, and setting your business up for success. But a little about me, I am a coffee lover, way too many cups a day, book obsessed.\
\
Cara Harvey [00:00:40]:\
I think I just hit book 18, just a few months into the year, and I'm a mom of 3. My kids are 6, 8, and 17. I am a former burnt out school teacher turned entrepreneur. I taught special education at the high school level for about 9 years, and it's wild to think about it that I am now currently 10 years out of the classroom. But I use a lot of the same techniques that I used when I was in the classroom with the moms that I coached today, and I call myself an accidental entrepreneur. I didn't mean to start my business, and it happened because I was tired. I was so burnt out and overwhelmed in education. I left to go full time into network marketing, and it looked really successful until it didn't.\
\
Cara Harvey [00:01:18]:\
Right? I was carrying my laptop around waiting to be at inbox 0. I just couldn't figure out how to run a business where I didn't feel like I had to hustle all the time. And I just couldn't find anything out there that addressed my life as a mom and as somebody who wanted to have a business. Everything was either very you know, if you wanna have a business, you gotta get up at 5 AM, you gotta hustle, but didn't take into account that I was up all night breastfeeding or that I stay up late talking to my teenager and all those things that happen as a mom. And so I started it myself. About six and a half years ago, I started my business, A Purpose Driven Mom. I am the host of The Purpose Driven Mom podcast, the author of the book, The 15 Minute Formula, and I've used my methods to impact over 20,000 moms in my programs, in my courses, and at my events. And I wanna let you know that whether you're a mom or not, the stuff that I'm gonna talk to you about today is gonna help you feel like you could grow your business with less hustle, with less shame, and move out of that, action paralysis and into an action that moves and grows and pushes the needle.\
\
Cara Harvey [00:02:18]:\
Alright? Here's what we're gonna cover today in our fast and furious time together. We're gonna talk about how goals can drive your business, and we all know about goal setting. I'm gonna teach you a specific way to craft goals that will leave you not feeling overwhelmed, moving forward, and actually intentional about your business, and what I believe is the best way to set your goals up for success. I know that there are a lot of people out there. We teach the smart goals, things like that. We're not gonna talk smart goals today. We're gonna talk category goals, and it's a little bit different than you might have heard. So I want you to know that sometimes less is more, and that is okay.\
\
Cara Harvey [00:02:51]:\
Alright? And maybe you've been here. Is this what business looks like for you? Right? I go this way. I go that way. I don't know what to work on, and then I'm confused. And then I get scrambled because I have so many things that I have to work on. So I'm feeling overwhelmed, and I'm feeling lost, and I'm not sure what to do. I've been there, again, six and a half years into the business. There are still days where I struggle with this, but so much less now because I've come up with a framework.\
\
Cara Harvey [00:03:15]:\
And that's what I'm gonna teach you today. So if you've been in this spot or trying to start, grow, or scale a business feels like this because you don't know what to work on, buckle up because that's what we're gonna cover today. Alright? We're gonna talk today about a goal driven business. What a goal driven business is where we start with a vision. Right? Right over here. We're saying, what do I want this to look like? Where do I wanna go? We then move into the plan. And I know that the plan isn't the sexy thing. It's not the fun thing.\
\
Cara Harvey [00:03:41]:\
It's not what wants to do, but the plan is what's going to drive you to the next stage, which is the do. And we're gonna talk about how do you set your schedule up for success. And then the rinse and repeat. How do you do it so you don't just one and done this? Right? Oh, I had a really have you ever had that where you have a really great month and you make all your goals and your plan, you're feeling good, but then you never duplicate it because it felt like, quote, too much to do. I'm gonna talk today about how to make and create this goal driven business. Okay? So we're gonna talk about 4 stages, and our first one is vision casting. I love vision casting because it allows us to define what success means like. It says, this is what my goal should be because it's important to me, not because I see some other guru on the Internet talk about it, not because I think that's what I'm supposed to be.\
\
Cara Harvey [00:04:23]:\
It's because this is where I'm supposed to be. Alright? So I want you to pretend like it's the end of the year or even the end of the month. That's sometimes that's too big for people. Sometimes thinking too far out is, like, too much. So even think of the end of the month. What do you wanna feel like in your business? I wanna feel accomplished. I wanna feel like I was productive. I wanna feel successful because like, what are all those things you wanna feel? I want you to write it down.\
\
Cara Harvey [00:04:45]:\
What will business look like for you where it feels good? What is that successful feeling? And we start with our feelings because when we jump right into making the concrete goals, it's very easy to get derailed if we don't know why we're doing it. Now I don't think your why is the only thing, but I think having a vision can help. I also want you to think about a word that might resonate how you wanna feel in your business. We call this the word of the month, word of the quarter, word of the year. This word allows you to pause and say, you know what? I really feel like I know what I wanna do, what I want this to look like, and I can run it through this filter. If I said the word productive, you could probably draw a picture of what a productive work would look like for you. If I my word this year is ease. Right? So what does ease look like? What does it feel like in my business? And then you ask yourself these questions.\
\
Cara Harvey [00:05:32]:\
If this doesn't bring me, insert my word, is it aligned for my business? And the answer can be yes or no. You can choose. Some months, my word is push. Some months, my word is rest. It really depends on what you want for your business. So I want you to think of your word. And in the vision casting, I also want you to think through what your day to day would look like if you showed up for that word. If I showed up for the word ease, would I drop my kids off, run home, rush, grab my coffee, and sit right at my desk, and just work, work, work until I pick them up? Maybe not.\
\
Cara Harvey [00:06:02]:\
If I use the word ease, what I try to do now is I drop them off, I grab my coffee, and then I sit, and I do personal development book, and I journal for 15 minutes, and I start my day with intentions. I'm not rushing it. Say my word was push, then it might look like that. And there's no right or wrong. There's no yes or no. But I want you to know that it can feel how you want it to feel, but you have to pre identify what actions you want to show to be able to show up in that way. I also want you to ask in your vision setting, what do you need to stop doing? If I wanna show up as a business owner who is productive, I need to stop having 30 minutes a day where I'm scrolling my TikTok mindlessly. I would need to stop not going into a day with with a plan.\
\
Cara Harvey [00:06:43]:\
Right? If I wanna show up as a business owner who is powerful, right, I need to stop second guessing every decision that I make. Right? I need to stop, procrastinating on certain things. What do you need to stop doing in order to have the success that you want? And what thoughts might you have to get, get rid of? Right? What are the thoughts you currently have that are in your way of fulfilling my word? If my word was we'll say powerful again. Right? I wanna be a powerful business owner. I wanna make powerful decisions. That's how I wanna feel. Well, the thought of imposter syndrome, the thought of I'm never good enough, the thought of I can't do that. We gotta get that out of the way.\
\
Cara Harvey [00:07:19]:\
Right? We need to remove that because that is gonna get in the way of you fulfilling the success you wanna have. So in your vision setting, in your vision casting, I want you to stop and do these things. I want you and, again, pause if you can. Journal through these questions. Ask yourself, what do I want success to look like? Because we're gonna make the plan now. I'm gonna show you different ways to make goals. But if you don't start with your vision, it's easy to get swept away. It's easy to say, well, this person, you know, Cara said success is this, so I must do this.\
\
Cara Harvey [00:07:49]:\
If you are solid and if you are concrete in what you want your business to look like, then it is easy for you to do these things. Alright? So go through, make your vision, and now we're gonna make the plan. This is the meat and the potatoes. This is the big stuff, but I'm gonna teach you planning not in the smart goals way, which, again, nothing wrong with smart goals, but I'm gonna teach you in a different way, and I'm gonna tell you why. The plan is how you get there. A lot of times we will make goals. We will put too many goals on our plate. We will not be focused in the right directions, and then we will get scattered in our business.\
\
Cara Harvey [00:08:21]:\
Instead, what I want you to do is follow my framework. I want you to make habits, dream, learn, plan, and a do goal. And these are gonna be different every single month. So one of the things I do in my planning is I will do this quarterly where I will kind of look through the next 3 months, and I will plan out things. Because if I was to put every goal that I wanted to work with on this, I would have 800 goals I was working on, and then nothing would happen because I would be overwhelmed. Right? And then I wouldn't move forward at all. But instead, I want you very intentionally to make goals set for your business that are aligned, and this will also allow you to backwards plan. If 3 months out, I know that my, quote, do goal is to launch a podcast, well, then I know that 2 months out, I should be planning, and 3 months out, I should be learning, and 4 months out, I should be dreaming.\
\
Cara Harvey [00:09:10]:\
Right? This is how you set yourself up for success. So I'm gonna go through each of these, and I'm gonna talk to you about a little bit of a different goal you can have for each of these sections. Okay? First up is habit goals. Now why do we create why do we create monthly habit goals? Like, why do we, make these goals for habits? We have to show up for our business a certain way to be the person we wanna become. So when you create a monthly habit goal, it lets you focus on changing your brain, changing your mindset, changing who you think you are into becoming the person you'd like to become, and we do that by daily habits. We want to look at the shiny angle and say, oh, I got to the end. I'm accomplished. I've done that.\
\
Cara Harvey [00:09:51]:\
But it's not about that. It's about the steps we take along the way to become that person. So you need to create a monthly habit goal, and I want you to pick 1 habit a month to work on. Now this doesn't mean it's the only thing you work on. If I made a goal last month of showing up on Instagram, this month, the habit of Instagram isn't going away. It's just not my main focus because now it's become a habit. I might not have to track it. I might not have to worry about it as much.\
\
Cara Harvey [00:10:18]:\
Alright? But when you pick one habit to focus on that month, you can track, you can get great results, you can collect data, and you can be focused instead of, well, I've got to be on TikTok and Instagram and Twitter and Pinterest and all these places. We're gonna pick 1. So these are just some great examples of habit based goals. Right? Social media posting, like I mentioned, pick one social media platform to focus on. Then say you do TikTok this month. Cool. Ask yourself, what's the next social media habit I want? Well, let's just do Instagram reels because that's easy. I'm just really repurposing.\
\
Cara Harvey [00:10:50]:\
So maybe this month, I'm focusing TikTok, TikTok, TikTok, TikTok, and then I'm gonna add in Instagram because it's another thing to do. I'm just gonna repurpose my videos and then add in checking on stories. Because it is a second platform, it does require a little bit extra work. You don't wanna do all the habits at once because then you're gonna get overwhelmed. And then maybe month 3, you're like, alright. Well, maybe I'll do YouTube shorts now because I already have the video. It's just adding in something else and adding in something else. It lets you focus and be an expert in that area, really learn it.\
\
Cara Harvey [00:11:18]:\
You could do things like live videos. Okay? This month, I'm gonna focus on doing one live video every single week or whatever it is. Showing up for work blocks is a great habit when you're a newer beginner. Right? A new business owner or if you've kind of gotten off track with working. My habit is I'm gonna show up. So I have, 10 work blocks every single week, 9 to 12, 12 to 3, Monday through Friday when my kids are at school. They look different every week, but my goal is to show up for a certain percentage of them. Why? Because I'm working from home and it's hard.\
\
Cara Harvey [00:11:48]:\
I really like Survivor, and I wanna go watch an episode. And, I see the dishes in the sink or somebody asks me to go up for coffee. Right? It can be really hard to stay focused on the work blocks that I have. So maybe your habit is I'm gonna show up for these workbooks that I said. Writing could be 1. If you wanna write, emails or blog posts or whatever it is Or, oh, let's just say episodes is spelled wrong, but podcast episodes or blog posts. Maybe your habit is showing up that way. So I want you to pick a habit based goal for the month.\
\
Cara Harvey [00:12:16]:\
Write it down. What is the habit you wanna show up for? Alright? And now we're gonna pick the next one. That is our dream goals. These are my favorite. I think each month, you should have a different dream focus. Okay? Now why dream? Let's talk about it. A monthly dream goal is something you wanna do in the future that you just need to give your brain intentional space around. I have tons of things I wanna do.\
\
Cara Harvey [00:12:38]:\
I'm a visionary. But if I don't say to myself, today is the day that I'm gonna go for, we'll talk about dream walks a dream walk about this topic, I'm never gonna do it. I'm running an in person event in September. There's a lot of dreaming that went on. If I didn't intentionally say this is the month I'm dreaming about the in person event, I would keep putting it off and putting it off. Because, especially, I talk to moms, we have a 100 things going on. But if I can ask myself, what is something I just wanna give my attention to? And I'm not only my attention, but my intuition, but my myself, my brain, my, my thoughts, my dreaming. We don't want your dreams to keep getting pushed off.\
\
Cara Harvey [00:13:11]:\
Do you make a monthly dream goal? So here's some, steps on how I kind of dream intentionally, a dream walk. I'm gonna go for 1 when we're done here recording this. I'm putting my sneakers, and I say to myself, Cara, you were thinking about x y z. And I tell myself what I'm gonna think about. I'm a Christian, so I'll be like, god, I'm open to it. I'm just like, I I'm ready for whatever download you wanna give me. God, universe, whatever it is. My brain, I'm open to it.\
\
Cara Harvey [00:13:33]:\
And I take a walk. And whatever happens, whatever comes up for me, I might pull the notepad off of my phone. I might voice memo myself, and I just dream. So let's talk about this in person event. I I've done many dream walks. So one of them I was like, you know, I wanna dream about, like, what it's gonna look like, what it's gonna feel like. I literally took a dream walk. I mapped out my guest speakers.\
\
Cara Harvey [00:13:52]:\
I mapped out the agenda, what it's gonna look like, the room, how many people. I just allowed myself this beautiful download that then let me move to the next stages. If you don't give yourself time to dream, even about your habit, like, what does Instagram look like for you? Then it's easy to not make goals that make sense. You can then move to journaling. So after I dream, I will then give myself the next week 15 minutes to journal and write all these things down. I don't actually physically type, handwriting, so I will type whatever I want. Prayer or meditation, that that's a big one for me. Like, I just mentioned, I'll just be like, god, what do you think? Help me.\
\
Cara Harvey [00:14:22]:\
Like, I give this to you. Right? And having thought partners or buddies to say, like, hey. I'm dreaming about this. Can I just talk these ideas out? Having a dream goal each month will intentionally move your business forward to success because you're giving yourself space. If you know you wanna launch that podcast in 4 months, dream about it now. Right? Dream about it now because it will allow your brain to open up to the possibilities. Now once we've made our dream goal, I then want you to make a learn goal. Now if you're like me, you probably get stuck in learning where you're like, I love to learn.\
\
Cara Harvey [00:14:51]:\
I wanna take a course. I wanna do all these things. I recommend you pick one learn goal a month, and what you do with this one learn goal is that you take the course. You do the thing. I'm gonna show you how to break it down, but you don't stay in it forever. You say this is what I'm gonna learn. Now how do you pick what you're gonna learn? Well, what do you need to plan? What do you need to do? What's next on your agenda? 1 month, my dream was in person event. The next month, my learn was in person event.\
\
Cara Harvey [00:15:18]:\
So I bought a course I'm currently taking on how to host an in person event. Alright? And then next month, I'll move into planning it, and then I'll move into starting the thing, like, actually doing it. So how do you break these learning, goals down? We'll talk about in a second, but I just wanna remind you that focused learning is the key in moving forward in your business. If you're like, I'm gonna learn this, and I know and I hear this listen. I hear this from the moms I coach. They're learning junkies, so they will get on every single course. Right? You're at this event. You're watching this presentation.\
\
Cara Harvey [00:15:49]:\
I'm sure you're a learning junkie. Right? But what are you gonna take from this event and move into with your learning? Right? Where are you gonna have it go? Focused learning is the key, not just learning. Picking what it is and then moving forward. So break your learning goal down. In person event example, you pick a course. I got a course. Determine the end date. When do you want the course completed? So for me, I wanted to have my venue booked because we're preselling tickets.\
\
Cara Harvey [00:16:15]:\
So I was like, alright. I need to have these modules finished by this date. Okay? You need to pick an end date. Why pick an end date? Because if you don't, you will continue to learn. You will continue to procrastinate. You'll continue to put off. So pick an end date, then you're gonna do math. You call these numerical goals.\
\
Cara Harvey [00:16:29]:\
Divide up the lessons, the modules, and the implementation by week. Let's do some easy math examples. Say, I decided I wanted to finish my course by the end of a month. There's 20 lessons modules right inside the entire thing, 4 weeks in a month. 20 divided by 4 tells me I need to complete 5 lessons every single week in order to finish it. That's very specific. It's very driven, but it's also flexible, because I don't want you to pick the days yet. I just want you to say how many you're gonna do each week.\
\
Cara Harvey [00:16:57]:\
And then each week when you're planning it out, you can look and say, great. I know that I said I had to do these 5. Maybe you got off track, maybe you got ahead, whatever it is. Which days am I gonna watch these? Because my schedule I don't know about you. My schedule is different every day. And so because my schedule is different every day, I have to make different, schedules, different plans. This allows me to take my learning goal and make it super focused. Okay? So we talked about habits.\
\
Cara Harvey [00:17:21]:\
We talked about a dream. I told you we're gonna be fast and furious fire hose today. We talked about learning. Now let's talk about creating a plan goal. Spending time planning will save you so much time in the long run. People don't wanna do it. I don't wanna do it, Cara. I got so many other things to do.\
\
Cara Harvey [00:17:36]:\
I just wanna get the work done. But when you actually plan out, what you're doing, when it's time to sit to work, you're gonna save yourself so much time. And we're gonna talk about that in the do. Right? But what could planning look like? Okay? This is where you're like, I'm gonna do content planning. So maybe I just took a course on Instagram. So next month, I'm gonna plan my Instagram. So I'm gonna spend time in planning goals. My planning goal is gonna be that I'm gonna make my quarterly Instagram plan.\
\
Cara Harvey [00:18:03]:\
I'm gonna write out my captions. I'm gonna plan what I'm gonna talk about for stories and have it already completed. Right? It could also be things like a launch breakdown. I mentioned launching a podcast, but you could also be launching a course or doing a webinar or anything like that. It could also be social media content. Alright? So this is where you're sitting down and you're saying, I'm gonna plan next week's TikToks. Right? I'm gonna decide what my live videos are, or just general task list. So we're talking about batching in a second, but this could also just be planning out, like, what is my content gonna look like for the next quarter, what is, my batch schedule is gonna be.\
\
Cara Harvey [00:18:37]:\
Spending time making a goal of planning will allow it to feel easier. So back to the in person event. When my goal is planning the in person event, that's where I'm taking all the tasks that I need to complete to make it happen, and I'm making a breakdown for it. Right? That's when I'm doing the planning like I'm doing now where I'm picking a venue and I'm calling food suppliers and I'm deciding on my, guest speakers. Right? I'm doing all the planning stuff in inside of it. Okay? Planning is so key because if you sat and spent the time breaking down your webinar launch, for example, like, what are all the tasks I need to do in a webinar launch? When it's time to get started to work on the webinar launch, you're not thinking and left with the question of, well, what am I supposed to work on? You can just get started, and and that's what we're gonna talk about now. That's what we're talking about in the do. Alright? So goal driven success for you as an entrepreneur is not so much always just in the do.\
\
Cara Harvey [00:19:32]:\
Right? It's do I make a habit goal? Do I have time to dream, which will in turn make the rest of this easier? Am I learning what I need to learn and moving forward? Am I planning out the tasks I need to have happen? And then how am I making it happen in the do? Right? The do is your main focus project. It's where your attention is going to be. So you might say your do is the podcast. Sometimes my do is just podcast batching. I wanna finish for the quarter. You know, I always pick one focus project. Now, again, it's not saying it's the only thing I'm working on. It's saying I wanna focus my my time in that area.\
\
Cara Harvey [00:20:06]:\
So we're gonna spend a lot of time, here now in stage 3. Right? So vision setting stage 1. Stage 2, really kind of planning out what you're going to be, and then stage stage 3 is the do. Alright? So the do tasks will get broken into the daily tasks. I mentioned this already. When you plan well, you can sit down and plan, and then when it your kid takes a nap when it's after bedtime or when you do get that precious work time that is so far and few between for so many of us, you are left knowing the the plan and just following it. You're not wasting time deciding what to do. It's showing up and it's making a schedule.\
\
Cara Harvey [00:20:51]:\
Now I'm gonna talk to you about batches a little bit today. Right? That's really my secret sauce. It's creating work batches so that everything is broken down for yourself for the month so that you can actually just get started. I wanna give you some sample batches. Okay? So depending on where you're at in your business. Right? So I always go through and I look at my dream, learn, plan, do, and my habits, and I ask myself, do I have batches, categories set for them? And if I don't, I make them. Now there's also batches and categories in your business that you'll do just because you have to. Right? Not everything, like, my podcast.\
\
Cara Harvey [00:21:26]:\
Right? I record a podcast episode with over 400 episodes. Right? I don't always quote do my podcast. Sometimes I'll do batching in advance, but the podcast is just something that runs in my business. It's just something that happens. So I always have to have a podcast batch in my week, but it doesn't, always it isn't always on my learn plan do. Does that make sense? So my learn plan do isn't the all encompassing what I'm working on, but it's my daily. Right? So things like my podcast or if you have a blog or YouTube channels, things like launches or affiliates, I have CEO time, admin time, learning. Do you have a learning block? Now sometimes I do learning multitask.\
\
Cara Harvey [00:22:05]:\
So most of the time, I like to do learning, and I have a learning block. I want you to think about your business, and I want you to think about all the things that you need to get done, and go ahead and make a list. Make a list of all the batches, all the categories, all the things you might need to do because this is what's going to make your schedule for the week. Alright? And I think okay. I'm not ready. I realized I don't think I have a slide on scheduling, but I'm gonna talk through it in a second because I think it's really important. But step 1 is, what are all the things you need to get done based on the goals you made, but also based on how your business runs? Again, just because you don't have a goal for it doesn't mean it's not something you work on in your business, especially when you've been doing this for a bit and you know what has to get done. So make your list of batches and then ask yourself some questions.\
\
Cara Harvey [00:22:49]:\
What are the tasks I need to complete in these categories for next month? So if I have a YouTube channel, for example, I might write down, outline episode 1. Right? Like, let's say 4 episodes. Right? Outline episode 1, outline episode 2, outline episode 3, outline episode 4. I might say record episode 1, 2, 3, 4. I might say edit. Right? Put all those things down. Do the same for a podcast or a blog post or if you're launching. Really break down the tasks and ask yourself, what are the things I need to complete in order to get them done? Because this is how you're going to make your schedule to get you moving forward.\
\
Cara Harvey [00:23:24]:\
Again, it's not this, like, arbitrary thing where it's like I sit down to work. It's where's my focus, what do I need to do, and what are my tasks? So so make a list for yourself. What are those tasks? And what is key here is doing this before the month begins. When you do this before the month begins, what this is going to do is allow you to sit down and work and not figure out what you're supposed to be doing. So I don't have a slide for this, but I wanna talk through what you do after that. Excuse me. So once you've created your batches, what I want you to do then is I want you to plan your time using time blocking. Right? So you're gonna, go through and make a time block.\
\
Cara Harvey [00:24:04]:\
Actually, you know what? I'm screen sharing. I'm not gonna edit. Hold on. I'm gonna go through and make a new tab, and I'm gonna show you this and make this for you right now because I don't have a slide of it, but I think it would be really important for you to see it, visually. So let me just throw up a doc real quick. Alright. So here's what we're gonna do. We're gonna make a little time block, and I'm gonna show you what you do with your batches because I thought I had that slide in there, but I don't.\
\
Cara Harvey [00:24:29]:\
So we're just gonna, improvise here. Alright. So when I think time blocks, 6 okay. Here. This is how I kinda set them up. In this column, I'm gonna write what my time block is, and then we'll just do Monday through Friday for now. Okay? Alright. Time blocks are essentially, like, 3 to 4 hour chunks.\
\
Cara Harvey [00:24:48]:\
So I mentioned I have 2 time blocks I work. I work 9 to 12, and I work 12 to 3. Yours might not look like that, but maybe you have similar ones. When I'm planning my week, I go back to my goals, and then I go back to my batches, and I ask myself, hey, where can this fit? So if I know that I need to work on a goal, I need to make sure that time exists. So first up is habits. Alright. So let's say my habit is Instagram. So I should have a social media block in here multiple times a week.\
\
Cara Harvey [00:25:18]:\
It doesn't have to be every day, but multiple times a week. That was remember that that is my habits goal is social media. So let's say we're gonna work on social media. Here, we'll do it 2 times a week. Alright? So 2 times a week, I'm showing up on social media. Now you can have this more or less, but at least I know that my habits goal has a home. Right? Because if you create a goal around, I'm gonna make this goal, but I don't know where it goes, that's when it doesn't happen. So my habits goal, here we go, 2 times a week.\
\
Cara Harvey [00:25:44]:\
Maybe you want to show up more. We'll start with 2 times a week. Again, it doesn't have to be the same time or the same day. My dream goal. Alright. So once a week, I wanna work on my dreaming for this new podcast I wanna have. Well, if I don't have a a themed block to dream, it's not gonna happen. Now I wanna tell you something about the way I teach time blocking.\
\
Cara Harvey [00:26:02]:\
Just because I have a theme there does not mean that's the only thing I'm working on, but it it means that's where I'm gonna focus it. So maybe I'm not only maybe I do a dream walk or a dream journal that takes 20 minutes, not the whole block, but it's where I fit it in. So I'm gonna have, 15 minutes where I also do dream. So maybe I will couple my Monday social media block with my dream block, because maybe these things don't take long. So you can have 2 themes if you want or you can have 1. We'll say for this example, Monday morning's dream social media. Okay. It's fit.\
\
Cara Harvey [00:26:31]:\
Do I have time for my learning? I found that I needed to take 4 lessons a week. I can do that in maybe a couple hours. So I only need one learn block. Let's make that Friday mornings. Cool. Alright. Planning. Do I have a planning block once a week? I need to fit it somewhere, so let's put it in here.\
\
Cara Harvey [00:26:50]:\
And then my do is my main project AKA my batches. So if we head back to I wanna say this one. Yep. This session this presentation here, see this section? This is where I need to put these in. So now I'm gonna put my do categories. Alright. Well, I need an admin block. I love those on Mondays where I'm doing administrative stuff.\
\
Cara Harvey [00:27:09]:\
I need a podcast block, so this tells me where I'm doing podcasting. I need a launch block. Oh, and I like a good buffer block. So we'll talk about that in a second. Let's say I also have a blog, so that can go there. And let's also put in an affiliates block to work on affiliate stuff. K? I like to leave at least one block open, and I call that buffer. I love it midweek or the end of the week.\
\
Cara Harvey [00:27:34]:\
What is it for? It's for the stuff that doesn't get done that I said I was going to do. It's for all the stuff I had on this list that didn't make it. I know there's a place for it to go. It's also for the stuff that I think about that I need to get done that week. Okay? So I want you to see how this all connects in the do phase. Right? We went through and made a vision. You said, what do you want this to look like? Where is it gonna be for you? Cool. You know where you wanna go.\
\
Cara Harvey [00:27:57]:\
You then went through the planning phase and you planned out your goals. You decided what they look like, and then you moved into the do phase where you've broken down your work batches. You figured out your task, and then you've created a schedule each week that can look different where you're saying this is where my goals are gonna go. This is my super intentional super intentional place I'm gonna go. Right? So what happens next? Well, it's it's step 4, and that's rinse and repeat. So this is where we create a system. This is where you make your goals monthly. Alright? So the 3rd week of every single month, I repeat this process, and I adjust it.\
\
Cara Harvey [00:28:34]:\
So I'm always kind of a little bit ahead. Right? The 3rd week of every month, I look at the next month and I ask myself what habit do I wanna work on? Did the habit I pitch, does that need a little bit more love, or can I move on? Can I add to it? Do I do I need more time to dream, or can I move that dream into learn? Right? Can I move my learn into plan, or do I need more time with that course? Did I plan what I needed to say, or where am I at, and then what's my focus project? This is a couple things. It allows me to stay focused. It's only the 3rd week of the month. I still have another week to go. So now I'm focused. Now I'm like, oh, cool. I love this.\
\
Cara Harvey [00:29:06]:\
This is what I wanna do. So I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to finish these goals because I'm excited. It also allows me to say, hey. This didn't work, so I need a little bit more time, and I can move it and rinse and repeat. When you constantly audit your goals and you're not just saying, I'll look at them at the end of the quarter, I'll look at them at the end of the year, you can move forward. You cannot stay stuck. You can actually make progress on things because you're not stuck in one place. I know we covered a lot today.\
\
Cara Harvey [00:29:37]:\
I told you this is gonna be a little fire hose, fast and furious. I'd love to connect with you more, and just help you out with your business, with your personal goals. I am really on a mission to help moms figure out how they can find time for what matters, and this is just one of the ways I teach it. You can join me on my podcast, which is the Purpose Driven Mom Show. I'm over on Instagram at a Purpose Driven Mom. I have a free workbook at the 15minuteformula.com/free. You can also links over to Amazon Barnes and Noble to buy the book. But what I want for you today is I want you to take one action from today.\
\
Cara Harvey [00:30:05]:\
K? You decide. Do I wanna make a vision for my goals for next month? Maybe. Do I want to figure out my dream, learn, plan, do in my habits? Do I want to spend some time breaking down my work batches? Right? Or do I wanna figure out my schedule for next week? And then ask yourself, how frequently am I checking in with my goals? How frequently am I making them a reality instead of just this cute thing I put on a vision board? That's what's gonna help you get to success in your business and not stay stuck. I am rooting for you. You've got this. Have a great one.\

**Transcript:**\
[00:00:12.280] - Carrie Wulf\
Hi, everyone. I'm really excited to be here. I'm Carrie Wulf, Founder of Wulfden Professional Solutions. I am a retired military spouse, a mom to three, a grammy of three, and a mom to three fur-babies. I discovered my love of systems and organization years and years ago as I was coordinating all of these cross-country moves with a family of five, plus our pets, plus special education needs. It took a lot of organization, but I have turned that love of organization and systems into my business. Now I am a fractional operations and project manager who likes to get nerdy by building out workflows and mapping out procedures and building out KPI tracking dashboards. If you want to connect with me on social or learn more about me, scan that QR code on your screen right quickly, and that will take you to a place where you can find all the places that I am at.\
\
[00:01:23.370] - Carrie Wulf\
As I began dipping my toes into the world of operations and project management, I tried out several different project management systems. I was trying Trello, I tried ClickUp, and Base Camp, and Airtable, and they were either too robust for what I needed or they just couldn't do what I wanted. I finally landed on that one that I love, and I've been using it for the past three years, and that would be Asana. I'm sure that you are wondering what in the world a project management tool has to do with blogging, but for me, it had everything to do with blogging. I learned how to leverage Asana to supercharge and organize my blogging research, my topics, and all my resources into a massive workflow and research library. Setting up my blogging with Asana really lets me plan out my weekly and monthly blogs with a high level of organization that both my blog writer and myself can follow.\
\
[00:02:34.980] - Carrie Wulf\
Today, I want to share my Asana blogging system with you. I was facing several challenges as I was trying to get my blog up and running, but also trying to work for clients and build my business. But these were the big three challenges that I was running into. I was having trouble with my time management. It was really a struggle for me to find the time to research and write a really good blog article. Then I struggled with my content organization. I had a stack of notebooks and a stack of sticky notes. Sticky notes were everywhere, and they were not helping me keep all of my topics and my content pillars in any kind of organizable fashion. Because I struggled with my time management and my content organization, that also meant I was struggling with consistency, trying to blog, trying to run the business and work with clients. It just wasn't working. I needed to find a better way. There had to be a better way for me to organize all of this, make it work. One day, I was working in a client's Asana account for their project, and I thought, Why don't I use Asana to get my blogging app together? That is what I did.\
\
[00:04:07.440] - Carrie Wulf\
But there are so many features to Asana. It's really easy to get overwhelmed if you've never used a platform like that before. As I was setting up my system, these are the features that I use the most. I really rely on those project boards to keep my blog workflow in one area and my content resource library in another. Those project boards are really key for the organization. But then I also keep things in the Board View. You'll see in a minute when I show you Asana, but I'm a visual person. Looking at things as one long list was just not doing it for me. I really needed to see it all laid out in the Board View. Then there's the Task Cards that help me keep all my topics and all my content organized. There's Template Cards available. Then I really rely on the Due Date function.\
\
[00:05:09.930] - Carrie Wulf\
I want to give you a sneak peek or a look behind the curtain, if you will, into what exactly my Asana looks like from the user viewpoint. This is my blog newsletter board. This is where I keep all of my monthly and weekly topics and everything highly organized. In this first column here, you'll see I've got a card for my SOPs. Any SOPs that are related to writing your blog post to SEO-ing it or loading it to your website, you can link all of that here. I've also got a Wounded Warrior banner page. I support and promote the Wounded Warrior program. I want to make sure that my blog writer has access to all of that information as she's writing out blogs. Then I've got my affiliate links. You might be thinking, Why do I have affiliate links on my blog page or my blogging board? That is because I promote affiliate products not only to my email list, but also in my blog. I want to make sure my blog writer has access to that. But I don't want to have to chase them down everywhere. She does not have access to all of my Asana workspaces. You'll notice that some of these have colored bars, and that indicates that the card also lives on a different board. If you open up the card, you'll see I can link my affiliate link here. But then this card also lives on my business dashboard. Now, that is a board that is private to myself, and my blog writer doesn't have access to it. I need these cards to live in a place where both she has access here and I have access on the dashboard. That's why there's a colored bar. That's also one of the features I love about Asana is that I can make these cards live in multiple places.\
\
[00:07:29.130] - Carrie Wulf\
This column here is my list of blogs to write. When I'm planning out my blogs, I do it by the month. Then for that month, there's a topic, and then I break it down further by each week. When I open up a blog card, this is what it looks like. You'll see that it lives in my Overwatch board, which is where my operations keeps an eye on everything all in one place. We'll see here, it is assigned to my blog writer. We've got the month and what the theme is for all of the blogs in that month. It's got all the information that she might need as she's writing out the blog. Then here you'll see as subtasks are each week in the month and what the topic is. You'll notice that there are two dates. I always put the publish date ahead of the topic, and then I put a due date on the subtask. The publish date, obviously, is when the blog is going to publish on the website, but the due date I assign to the subtask is when I have to have that copy to me for review. Now, if you're working with different copywriters or team members, you can also assign people on these subtasks. But this is how I track all of my blogs. But I don't create these cards from scratch every single month. That would be a nightmare. I have one card that is what I call my Template Card. Then I just duplicate this card each time I'm getting ready to plan out a month. I duplicate the task, I update it with the new month's name, and I create the task. It's going to take just a minute and it'll start popping in there as things populate. Then all I have to do is rinse and repeat. I add the month, I add topics, and then I go through here and add the publishing date and the topics. One of the great things I love is that you can add subtasks to a subtask. I also utilize subtasks for the research. As my blog writer is looking at it, she sees what the topic is, I have also provided her with the research. As I'm figuring out what I want to write about and doing the research, I always link it here in the subtasks-subtask. That way, when she goes to write it, all she's got to do is click this and she's got all the information that she needs to get that article ready to go.\
\
[00:10:39.480] - Carrie Wulf\
You might be wondering, where do I keep all of that research and information as I'm planning out my blogs? Well, the answer to that would be in my research library. This is my research library. This is the Big Kahuna, was what I like to call it. I have lots of different topics and content pillars that I like to blog and talk about. I organize all of the research and information into this research library. You'll see here, I've got just like on the blog workflow, we had the resources. This one is called the article parking lot. As I'm reading emails and newsletters and blogs and I see an article that I want to keep because it pertains to the topic I want to write about or it's a topic I write frequently about, I want to send that to the Assignment Board. Each column is a different topic pillar that I frequently blog or talk about in my blogs. But I want to make sure I'm populating that with research so that when I get ready to write about something or if I'm struggling on a topic idea, I can always come into this research library and have that information right at hand.\
\
[00:12:12.240] - Carrie Wulf\
The easiest way to start building your research library is by using the Asana Chrome extension. You want to navigate over to the Chrome Web Store. This says remove from Chrome only because I've already added it there. Once you add to Chrome, it's going to show up here in your Chrome toolbar. If you don't see this in your toolbar, you might need to pin it. You can do that by going to the puzzle piece and then looking for the Asana extension and just click that blue thumb tack, and that's going to pin it right up here to your toolbar.\
\
[00:13:05.750] - Carrie Wulf\
Like I said, as I'm reading and surfing the web and reading newsletters, I find an article that I want to send to my research board. This is one that was in my inbox recently, and I want to save it because these are topics I frequently speak about and blog about. But I don't want to do the whole copy. Go to Asana, open a task card, paste it in. There's a much easier way and it's magical. I'm going to click my Asana extension and it's going to pop out a window. Now, if you are an Asana frequent flyer, meaning if you're in multiple Asana workspaces, just make sure that the one displayed here is the one you need it to be. Make sure it's your own Asana workspace before you start sending things to it. You can assign it to a team member right from this pop-up window if you want. But I'm going to put it into the project. The project I'm sending it to is my research library. Just type in the first few letters and click on research library. You'll see here it's going to the research library and it's going into the article parking lot. Then I want to click on this link because that's going to link the current web page that I'm on. You'll notice that it has added the title of the article as the title of the card and it has this big link. Now, before I click Create task, remember that it's showing up in the article parking lot. I'm going to create the task. Now, let's pop back over to Asana. There it is. The website we were just on is now in the article parking lot. The reason I have this very first column labeled parking lot is because anytime you use the Chrome extension, it's going to send whatever web page you're using it on, it's going to populate in this first column always. On all of my boards, it's either labeled resources or parking lot or brain dump, idea spot, whatever you want to call it. Just remember that when you use that extension, it's always going to send them to this first column. Then all you have to do is once a week, if I'm being honest, it's probably monthly for me, you just go in and you sort. It's a simple grab and drag.\
\
[00:16:12.170] - Carrie Wulf\
Let's see. This one is about Google productivity. I want to grab it, and I'm just going to slide it over here to Google Workspace, and that's where it's at. That's all you got to do to create your library is just drag these research articles into the topic or content pillar that they talk about. Then when you are ready to reread the article, all you've got to do is open the card. If you highlight the link and you right-click and then go to, it is going to open up that article that you saved. It could be a year ago, but now you're ready to read it or use it in your content, and there you go. It's a huge, huge time saver to do that.\
\
[00:17:14.860] - Carrie Wulf\
Now that I've shown you the Chrome extension and I've shown you how to set up a blog workflow and a research library, there are some integrations that Asana uses that are incredibly helpful to really streamline and optimize your blogging system. Some of the integrations Asana works with, there are tons. But for communication, you can connect your Evernote or your MS Teams right into your Asana account and communicate back and forth that way. I frequently use it with Slack. There is a Slack integration. As I'm working with different team members and there's a comment or something in Slack and I want to put it in Asana, I can use that integration and send it directly in there without having to copy and paste. You can also directly link your Loom videos. If you're making an instructional video or a quick video note, you can connect that as well. As far as file storage goes, Asana integrates wonderfully with everything in the Google-verse, the Drive, your Docs, your Sheets, you can connect pretty much anything in Google to your Asana. You can also connect it to Dropbox or your OneDrive. Asana really has a lot of integrations that will help you stay organized and streamline your entire blogging process.\
\
[00:18:51.570] - Carrie Wulf\
One of the great things I like about Asana is that the Project Cards or the Task Cards really give you a lot of options to make sure everyone is on the same page. You're able to assign it to a primary team member. You can set your due dates. You can give instructions or link any other relevant information. You can even create those subtasks with individual topics and assignments and due dates. It allows you to open up those subtasks and add even more information. If you're working with a copywriter or graphics or social media promotion, you can add those steps as subtasks and really dial in your process so that there is not a step that gets forgotten along the way.\
\
[00:19:48.470] - Carrie Wulf\
But I know that all of this probably is coming at you like a firehose. If you're completely unfamiliar with project management systems, this is pretty overwhelming. I don't want you to be overwhelmed. I want you to be able to take action and get this set up in your accounts quickly. If you scan the QR code that's on your screen, that will take you to a place to sign up and grab a workbook. Inside that workbook, I talk about Asana in a little bit more in-depth, but I've also linked some templates for you. It's a really easy\'85 Click the link, download the file, and then I have instructional videos that walk you through each board and how they work and how to import those boards into your Asana account. I know this was a lot of information, but please grab that workbook because it's got individual videos for each board that talks about the board, how they work, and how to put that into your own Asana account. I want you to be able to get started with this right away and not put it off until maybe next week or next month when you have time. Those links give you the ability to get started on it right away.\
\
[00:21:14.730] - Carrie Wulf\
I want to thank everyone for attending today. I know it's a new year and we're all excited to hit the ground running and get stuff going. We're really just pumped up to start the year out fresh. I just want to say thanks for listening, for taking the time out. Please make sure you download that workbook so that you can really start putting these action steps into practice and get your blogging workflow set up and dialed in.\

**Transcript:**\
[00:00:00.000] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
All right, guys. I'm very excited about this conversation with sought-after business consultant Danielle Levy. She helps online business owners expand with clarity and efficiency after her experience in the traditional business world, Danielle took her marketing expertise and systems acumen to consulting and guiding entrepreneurs toward becoming the CEOs they were meant to be. Danielle, thank you so much for joining us and being part of this year's Summit.\
\
[00:00:36.270] - Danielle Levy\
Thank you for having me. It's such a thrill, so thank you.\
\
[00:00:39.530] - Liz\
Yeah, so we're going to be talking about why every business needs an ICE plan. Let's start with what is an ICE plan?\
\
[00:00:46.000] - Danielle\
Sure. So ICE stands for "In Case of Emergency." And I would give the additional context, not only does every business need an ICE plan, every household needs an ICE plan also. But yes, we will have this conversation in the context of businesses. I would also elaborate on that even though ICE is emergency, it's a vacation plan. It's a, "What if this happens plan?" It's a, "yes, but I already have this in place, it will give me more flexibility later plan."\
\
[00:01:17.320] - Liz\
I'm sick when I'm not planning to be, plan.\
\
[00:01:20.930] - Danielle\
Exactly. I think the connotation with this conversation is that something scary is going to happen and it gets people's adrenaline going, and people don't want to think about it and all that stuff. But also I would really encourage people to think about the possibility and the freedom that comes with just taking the time to get this stuff in order.\
\
[00:01:43.600] - Liz\
Yes. Okay, because I feel like it can encompass so much, how do you even go about starting to create one and figuring out what one looks like for you and your business?\
\
[00:01:54.880] - Danielle\
Yeah, I think there's a couple of ways to do it. If you're in the throes of business and you're like, "I can't even deal with this," and it's the last thing you want to be thinking about, it can be as simple as creating a folder in your inbox of, "Oh, I know this has something to do with my ICE plan. I don't really know what yet, but let me just store it there. Or that this piece of mail came in, let me shove it in an envelope." That's the bare-bones, very passive approach to it, but at least you're thinking about it, it's aware.\
\
[00:02:32.900] - Danielle\
If you're like me, and this is because it has to be routine for me, not because I'm any more on top of it than anybody else. I'm a freaking mess in all parts of my personal and business life. I work it in as part of my ritual. Every month I do my P&L for my business, and as part of that, it's review. There's literally a hyperlink that goes right to my ICE plan that says, "Did you review this?" Then it's just a very organic process.\
\
[00:03:05.430] - Danielle\
I also take \'97we have a long weekend coming up here. I will set aside relaxing time. What else have I changed in my business that can I fold in? Where it's like low-pressure, dedicated, uninterrupted client time to really bring things together. I would say it's \'97I don't think it's anyone's favorite thing to look forward to in a business, but think about past habits that you've had in your business like, "I have to file my taxes or I have to go through this massive RFP," or whatever that mindset is that you get in when you have to do the thing that seems so big and scary, even if it's not really, that's where you want to get yourself to.\
\
[00:03:45.180] - Liz\
Okay so, you say you have a thing where it's like review your ICE plan. What is your ICE plan? Give us some examples of what goes into an ICE plan. What does it look like?\
\
[00:03:55.320] - Danielle\
Sure. And so first of all, on my website, there are ICE plans. So the way that I think about it is I take my business apart. There's three parts to my business. There's the front of the house, sales, marketing, visibility, my social media accounts, etc. There's the house, which are my offers, anything that makes me money in the business. And then the back of the house is operations, legal, finance, team, all that stuff that keeps the business going.\
\
[00:04:29.710] - Danielle\
That's how I break my business apart. I think about my business in terms of what blind spots exist "that if this thing happened, what would be the follow-up?"\
\
[00:04:41.920] - Danielle\
The example that I give, and I think this is a convenient example because you have a little friend there with you right now. I was in a multimillion-dollar launch for a client of mine, and our tech VA's furry friend passed away mid-launch. I am a pet owner. My kids, my pets, they're on that same wavelength. But the level of AWOL that this person took as a result of that loss was not anything like I had ever seen before and put the entire launch at risk. And the problem was, this was the problem with the business. One, the tech VA was the only person that had one set of login credentials that we needed because we had created it not too long ago. And two, the owner of the business could not figure out how to log into her website so that we could change a couple of things. I see the cringe that you're making. Had there been an ICE plan...\
\
[00:05:43.930] - Liz\
No, it happens.\
\
[00:05:45.540] - Danielle\
It happens, right? Yeah. It would have been like, "This is your host. Here's how you get to the password." We would have thought about who else needs access other than this tech VA, who again, I'm not meaning to sound cold, it was just like, "Go grieve your cat. But by the way, this launch has to still happen."\
\
[00:06:06.380] - Danielle\
Had there been a little more planning in that situation, had we not realized there was this blind spot in the business of this particular tech VA that had a little bit too much control, a lot of the anxiety would have just been a non-issue. It's an example that never has to happen again, but those are the kinds of things that \'97when I think about putting together an ICE plan, it's what's the thing am I not planning for, that if it happens? What's my risk tolerance for if this thing happens, how am I going to respond to it?\
\
[00:06:38.110] - Liz\
It's almost like a place to house all the information so that if something falls out, you have the information to give someone to pull in.\
\
[00:06:47.150] - Danielle\
Exactly.\
\
[00:06:47.940] - Liz\
Okay.\
\
[00:06:48.830] - Danielle\
Exactly. And also in the same regard, most of us got into business or work for ourselves for a certain amount of either time freedom or money freedom, or whatever the "is" that we're looking for. I can step away for vacation and my right-hand person has a copy of my ICE plan, I cannot be bothered. And that's really nice.\
\
[00:07:10.390] - Liz\
Yeah. No. Okay. I like that. All right. So if you \'97this is like a completely new concept to you or to people in our audience, where would you suggest they start in creating one? Where is a good starting place?\
\
[00:07:25.410] - Danielle\
Gather what you have. And that can be when you go to pay your monthly invoices. Who are you paying? "Okay, I'm paying these people on my team. I'm paying for these types of softwares." Really just work very organically to just start gathering. And it's one of those things that once you start doing it and you figure out what your system is, it all just flows together. And I feel like it, for me, it's become a bit of a game. Like, "Ooh, this thing came up or this thing went away. How is my ICE plan doing?" So, just the most important thing I feel like is get started and to be thinking about it. Because unfortunately, in that case of that launch that I described, you don't want to ever go, "Oh, shoot. I wish I had an ICE plan." If you're going, "Oh, shoot. I wish I had an ICE plan," then it's too late. It's not too late...It's...\
\
[00:08:28.810] - Liz\
A lot harder and a lot more stressful.\
\
[00:08:30.010] - Danielle\
A lot harder.\
\
[00:08:31.340] - Liz\
Okay. What are some maybe mistakes you've seen people make in creating ICE plans? Maybe overdoing it, not doing enough, or not being able to find things? What are the mistakes and how can they be avoided?\
\
[00:08:47.190] - Danielle\
Sure. I actually think the biggest mistake is not specifically related to the ICE plan. I think the mistake is, as businesses are successful and there's money coming in, there's not enough points that people pause and realize, "This business is more than I thought it would be," or "Oh my gosh, look at all of these assets that I have created." It's that snowball of how businesses grow. It never feels like a good time to say, "Oh, I need an ICE plan now."\
\
[00:09:25.080] - Danielle\
Unfortunately, I've seen it where you stop thinking about \'97all of us are so passionate about our businesses and our clients' businesses, but not pausing to say, "Whoa, I'm not protecting my intellectual property."\
\
[00:09:41.240] - Danielle\
I was working for one of the biggest funnel strategists there is, and one of her students, and she sells her course to thousands and thousands of students every time she opens cart, actually took her website and did a space (??) \'97 she just ripped it off. This funnel strategist was like, "Well, I don't have anything to protect against that." This massive business, bigger than I could ever dream, and there was no IP protection.\
\
[00:10:12.620] - Danielle\
It's less about doing the ICE plan the wrong way, and more realizing as this unfolds and as my business grows, and as I come into who I am as a business owner, and what I'm doing for my clients, really taking the time to go, "Oh, wow, this is a real thing." And the cost of, if this goes south of what that's going to \'97it's not having that light bulb moment of, "What do I need to do to protect this?" I think that's a mistake.\
\
[00:10:44.160] - Liz\
So yeah, if you guys missed the legal sessions. Those happen typically day one, I'm not sure what day we're airing this one, but upgrade or go back and watch them if they're still available, depending on when this session is airing. But the legal sessions, this is why we have them.\
\
[00:11:03.440] - Danielle\
And you know what? A lot of people, it's not even because they didn't have time to do the thing. Most people, unless you get your legal experts involved or your operations, your HR, whoever those people are, you don't even understand what your blind spots are until you get the expert involved and then you go, "Oh, wow, I better do something about this." So, it's that awareness of where you're at, how fast time goes, how much we're creating on a day-to-day business that to not just be so in the business, but actually to come up for air and say, "How am I....."\
\
[00:11:42.390] - Liz\
See the forest through the trees.\
\
[00:11:44.570] - Danielle\
Yeah.\
\
[00:11:45.470] - Liz\
Yeah. Working on the business rather than in it, it's yeah, which takes practice. It's a skill that you have to develop just like anything else. I don't think it comes naturally to anybody.\
\
[00:11:54.670] - Danielle\
No.\
\
[00:11:55.950] - Liz\
Just keep that in mind if you're struggling with it. Okay, so we've touched on a few real-world examples. You mentioned Tech VA or whatever. Let's do some more. Let's dive deep, I guess, in terms of like, who am I paying? We've got, how do you log into things? What are some other elements that would go into an ICE plan that you think? I think I see a lot of people that plan a maternity leave, and maybe don't call it an ICE plan, but same idea. So let's get some more examples going.\
\
[00:12:34.740] - Danielle\
Thinking about the idea of \'97I don't know if you're familiar with Rocket Fuel and Visionaries and Integrators and that concept? Just that whole idea of, as CEOs really, I think there's this huge mentality of stepping away from the business, having team members that you trust, everyone being in their zone, which I am all for. But at the same time, I don't think you want that gap to get so large that you don't know what's happening in your business. I'll give you an example that I fell into.\
\
[00:13:17.880] - Danielle\
Just before we started recording, we were having a chat, and I was talking about my right hand. I was quite literally in a situation where my calendar links got all messed up. I'm embarrassed to say it. I didn't know what the scheduling plan looked like. I was so used to, "I'm doing all these visionary things. I've got my right hand, the businesses." And when push came to shove and I had to move a simple appointment on my own calendar, I couldn't figure out how to do it. And these particular meetings were critical meetings that I needed to show up and be my best self.\
\
[00:13:50.030] - Danielle\
So all of us and any of us can step into these things. So, it's understanding I think, how to be informed and to know if I'm not informed, how can I become informed quickly while still really empowering teams and team members to be in their day-to-day, most productive spots.\
\
[00:14:12.090] - Liz\
Okay. How do you keep an ICE plan organized? How would you go about organizing it? So, yes, you've got all the information that people can step in, figure it out, but how do you \'97it could potentially be a lot of information and trying to then sift through it. Do you have any advice on that?\
\
[00:14:34.920] - Danielle\
I heard a couple of different \'97if I don't answer your question, just let me know and I'll go at it again. So for the purposes of conversation, go to my website, look at the physical examples of how these are laid out. I think that visual will be really helpful for people to say, "This isn't that hard to organize this."\
\
[00:14:56.200] - Danielle\
Go take a look. There's plenty of ICE plans out there if folks aren't a fan of mine. In terms of the physical organization of it, there are examples available. In terms of sifting through the information, my feeling is, when in doubt include it. You don't know what you don't know and what you're going to need, and then break it down based on \'97in the same way, use your P&L as the guide. "Okay, these are my software costs every month. What is rolled up in this number? Okay, I know I'm spending" \'97I'm making up a number here, "$1,000 on software. Okay, what are all of the pieces that are rolling up to that number? Oh, do I know what those logins are? Do I know what I'm paying for that? Oh, wait, I'm paying for that thing and we don't even use it anymore. Get rid of that one." It's an audit for the rest of your business and how things are working. If there's any outliers like, "What does this piece of software do?" or "I don't know what this does?" that should be the flag that goes off like, "Let me investigate this a little bit more," because I think ICE plans are a great way to keep your business in check and keep your audit tight.\
\
[00:16:09.970] - Liz\
Okay. Where do you suggest your ICE plan live? So that you have access to it, potentially other people have access to it. Like, where does it live and how does it stay up to date?\
\
[00:16:23.920] - Danielle\
Sure. So in terms of access, I'm going to keep it real. My right-hand person has access to it, and my dad has access to it, and that's it. You don't want\'97you want to make sure \'97you don't want it floating everywhere. I have it locked up in a secure, like this set of passwords will get you to this folder, will get you to that folder, type thing. Because again, you don't want it to be in the wrong hands either. Right? Configure it in a way that makes sense to you. If it's you don't want to include your passwords and your passwords are in DashLane or LastPass, or wherever we keep your passwords, that's cool, too. It just has to be a logical; somebody from the outside comes in, how do they know how to navigate through your business to get the snapshot of it?\
\
[00:17:22.140] - Danielle\
In terms of updating it, like I said, I review it every month when I do my P&L. A lot of folks do quarterly or H1, H2 annual planning. I think the ritual is the most important. You don't want it to be like that pesky doctor's appointment that you put off, you put off and then you're like, "Wait a minute. It's been three years since I've been here. What do you mean? How could that much time have passed?" That's not what you want. So it's the ritual of how do I feel like I'm in a really good place to make sure that it is up to date?\
\
[00:17:55.120] - Liz\
I feel a little bit of tact because I am overdue for scheduling a doctor's appointment by a month, not three years, because I have to find a new doctor. Okay. No, I like that. Is there any aspect of creating an ICE plan for business that we haven't covered or that you feel like, "Please take note of this and do this?"\
\
[00:18:20.830] - Danielle\
I would say do what you can as often as you can. It's never going to be perfect. Don't wait for that opportunity where I have a whole day dedicated to my ICE plan. Let me tell you that day is not coming that you're like, "Let me work on my ICE plan." It also is something that you have to have patience with. "Oh, I know I have insurance. I don't know who the provider is, or I have the provider, but I don't know the policy number." It's just something that you just want to keep chipping away at. Like all of our businesses, this is how we got here. Don't be afraid to involve your team. "Hey, this is our tech stack." Have your team member, "I need these six pieces of information." Or go to your bookkeeper and say, "Hey, I noticed this was my software cost, or this was my team cost. Can you give me a breakdown of those invoices?" Just incorporate it into your mindset.\
\
[00:19:22.290] - Liz\
Yeah. No, and I will say even if you manage to set aside a day, you're going to get to that day and you're going to completely miss things because it's not at the top of mind, or you're not able to brainstorm it. So unless you had kept a list of everything you need to actually gather that day, it's not going to be a very successful day regardless. Okay, last question I want to ask is an ICE plan versus SOPs in your business. Difference, how they work together, how they don't, like because it's\'97 ICE plan is sounding a little bit like an SOP to me.\
\
[00:19:55.340] - Danielle\
I can see that I hadn't actually ever considered that, but keep in mind your SOP or your SOP vault is accessible to your team. This is not accessible to your team. And quite frankly, if God forbid something were to happen to me, and I needed my dad who has a copy of my ICE plan to step into my business, my dad isn't going to know what to do with 99% of the SOPs in my business. My dad needs to know this is my right-hand person. She knows how to get in touch with all of my clients. She knows how to clear my calendar. She knows how to get to this particular piece of software that needs to get paid for. So it's one step removed from the SOPs of your business. So yes, is it an SOP for my dad to follow about my business? Yes, but it's more...\
\
[00:21:03.170] - Liz\
It's the forest versus trees SOP.\
\
[00:21:06.120] - Danielle\
Exactly. And it's the glue of how do we get things done. "Okay, this person is my website host. This is the phone number. This is the website. This is the account number." Then my dad can go contact my tech VA and my marketing person, and they have the tools that they need to do their job, which normally I wouldn't give them that much access to my business. Does that make sense?\
\
[00:21:33.460] - Liz\
Yeah. No, that does make sense. I like that distinction. All right. Now I need to put together an ICE plan for my business is what I'm learning. I thought I was behind on SOPs, which I am. But now I'm like, "Well dang it, I really should have this together." Which is something I thought about, because I'm like, my family, and this is probably going to be true for most bloggers and online business owners, they don't totally understand what I do in general. They're like, "What do you do? How do you make money? What? What?" And so having some details that if something happened, they could handle some things for me.\
\
[00:22:12.440] - Danielle\
And if I could just add the difference of \'97and my poor dad, he's not actually \'97he doesn't even know I'm having this conversation about him. If I am not available and my clients can't get a hold of me, that puts my business at risk. If they get an email from my dad or my assistant or whoever it's going to be that says, "Danielle is fine. She had an appendicitis. She'll be back in three days." That simple piece of communication is the difference in my client's business and me potentially having a huge financial loss.\
\
[00:22:48.460] - Liz\
Yeah. Like communication is key. With the Summit, I'm juggling a lot of speakers. And I'm like, "Look, if you have to change something," you're like, "Hey, my kid got sick, I can't record." I'm like, "Okay, cool. Kids come first. Absolutely. Totally understand that." But just making that communication as opposed to radio silence and I'm following up and I'm following up and I'm following up and I'm not getting anything, that drives me crazy. So yes. Okay. And I think you have something for attendees or you want them to follow you on social or share?\
\
[00:23:23.870] - Danielle\
Yeah. So I think the easiest thing to do is, my website is danielleclevy.com. I'm on Instagram. I respond to every message that comes in. It's @danielle_c_levy.\
\
[00:23:39.400] - Liz\
And that'll be link below.\
\
[00:23:42.130] - Danielle\
Yes. I am so grateful for the community that has gotten me to this point in my career and in my business that if people have questions about anything that I've said or that they're wondering about, I'm just going to answer them. I get excited to talk about this stuff, and I get excited for people to be really successful in what they're doing because you don't know what you don't know. Anything that people need, I can't stress enough, just ask me. Just ask you. You've got an incredible lineup of speakers here. I'm positive that the feeling is mutual across the board.\
\
[00:24:19.800] - Liz\
Yes, absolutely. And then I think you've got something for the "Speaker Bonus Bundle" or is that undecided yet?\
\
[00:24:28.340] - Danielle\
I'm not saying it's undecided. It's a big surprise.\
\
[00:24:30.780] - Liz\
Okay, let's call it that. And if you guys have the upgrade, definitely do that. And I'll have information on what is in there below this video.\

[00:00:12.910] - Eb Gargano\
Hi, I'm Eb Gargano from Productive Blogging and I am delighted to be speaking again at the Blogger Breakthrough Summit. This year, I'm talking about how to turbocharge your productivity with one simple to do list hack. Let's dive in, shall we? So, for those of you who don't know me, my name is Ed Pegano and I am the blogger behind Easypeasyfoody and Productivelogging.com. I have been blogging since 2015 and in that time my blogs have been read by over 18 million people around the world.\
\
[00:00:50.260] - Eb Gargano\
I've launched five successful online blogging courses with over 2000 students enrolled. I've published four ebooks. I also run two Facebook groups and I manage to publish six to eight blog posts per month. Plus send out six to eight blog newsletters per month as well as keep on top of two inboxes and nine social media accounts. And I make a comfortable six figure income.\
\
[00:01:17.160] - Eb Gargano\
And yet I work pretty much Monday to Friday and nine to five. I take time off during my kids school holidays and I take most weekends off. And I also take a random midweek days off pretty much whenever I want to. I do outsource a couple of things, but over 90% is done by me. I don't have a large team supporting me, I'm a solopreneur.\
\
[00:01:45.660] - Eb Gargano\
And people always ask me how? How do you do it? How do you get so much done? How do you achieve so much and yet still have a life? How are you so productive?\
\
[00:01:59.640] - Eb Gargano\
Well, that is what this session is all about. In this session I'm going to be sharing with you an amazing to do this hack that has literally transformed my life. No word of a lie. This hack has made me even more productive. It's helped me to earn a lot more from my blog, it's massively improved my work life balance and it's massively reduced my stress levels too.\
\
[00:02:29.590] - Eb Gargano\
And the best thing about this to do list hack is it is super simple and free. There's no need for any complicated or expensive software. But before we dive into exactly what this hack is, I want to ask you if you identify with any or all of the following statements I'm not earning enough money from my blog. I feel like I never have enough time to do everything I want to do on my blog. I feel stressed and overwhelmed by everything I have to do.\
\
[00:03:07.990] - Eb Gargano\
Blogging is no fun anymore. Let me know which of these you identify with in the chat. As you know, this presentation is pre recorded so that I can be in the chat with you in real time, interacting with you and answering your questions as we go. So feel free to ask any and all questions that you have during this presentation. Okay, so the good news is if you have identified with any of these questions, you are in the right place.\
\
[00:03:38.040] - Eb Gargano\
Because this simple and free todo list hack will help with all of those things. But before I tell you what the todo list hack is, it's really important that you understand what the problem is. The real problem. The real reason why you are feeling overworked and underpaid, the real reason why you feel like you never have enough time, the real reason why you are feeling stressed and overwhelmed by all the things you feel you should be doing. You see, there's a basic principle that we all have a finite amount of time to spend on our blogs.\
\
[00:04:19.090] - Eb Gargano\
Now, some of you will obviously have more time than others, but no matter who you are, no one has more than 168 hours in a week. Even if you are the richest person on earth, you cannot buy more time. Time is finite. So given that you only have a finite amount of time for your blog, whether for you that's ten or 100 hours a week, it makes logical sense that you should spend those hours on the highest impact tasks. In other words, you should spend your time on the tasks that will move the dial the most, the tasks that will make the biggest difference to your bottom line, the tasks that will help you achieve your goals in the shortest amount of time.\
\
[00:05:13.620] - Eb Gargano\
The problem is, most people do the exact opposite without even realizing it. I've been working with bloggers now for over five years. I've helped hundreds of bloggers become more productive, more successful, and build more profitable online businesses. And time and time again, I SEO the exact same problem. Those high impact tasks are the ones that never get done.\
\
[00:05:43.460] - Eb Gargano\
They're the ones that languish at the bottom of a to do list. They're the tasks that keep getting put off and put off and put off until some mythical one day in the future that never happens. And instead, the tasks that do get done are the less impactful tasks, the tasks that only move the dial a very small amount, and the tasks that don't move the dial at all. And the reason? The reason is your todo list is not fit for purpose.\
\
[00:06:21.880] - Eb Gargano\
You see, most bloggers I encounter fall into one of four groups when it comes to to do lists. Cap number one is they don't even have a to do list. It's all in their heads. Cap number two, they have a very, very, very long list of everything they feel they ought to do, everything they see other bloggers doing, and everything someone once said on a webinar that they should be doing. Camp number three is a combination of one and two, a very long list of everything and a bunch of stuff in your head.\
\
[00:07:04.680] - Eb Gargano\
And camp number four, they have some fancy software that's so complicated to use that most of the time they end up resorting to writing stuff on bits of paper and or keeping it in. Let's I'd love to know which camp you feel you fit into or is there a camp I've missed? Either way, let me know in the text. So no matter which camp you are in, your to do list is the problem. Your to do list is not helping you.\
\
[00:07:35.220] - Eb Gargano\
In fact, your todo list is holding you back. Because you see, todo lists were not created equally. A good todo list is your ticket to greater productivity, less stress, better results and ultimately achieving your goals. A bad to do list is the exact opposite. It reduces productivity, it creates stress and it doesn't help you see results or achieve your goals.\
\
[00:08:06.260] - Eb Gargano\
So what's the solution? Many people look at this problem and conclude that the whole notion of a todo list is the problem and so they throw the baby out with wash water and get rid of to do list entirely. I think that's a mistake because actually done right, a to do list can be a very powerful tool. A good todo list can help you earn more, help you get a much better work life balance and reduce your stress levels and feelings of overwhelm. So the solution is not to throw the whole concept of to do list out altogether, but rather use a better, more effective todo list.\
\
[00:08:55.570] - Eb Gargano\
A todo list that helps you identify your most impactful tasks and plan your time out in a way that will ensure you actually do your most impactful tasks and don't get sidetracked by busy work, nice but not necessary tasks, time wasters and shiny objects. My to do list Hack my effective to do list does not require any fancy, complicated, expensive software. It is in essence just a simple spreadsheet. Well, it looks very simple and it's very simple to use, but it is when years properly insanely powerful. In fact, when I first figure this hack out it totally transforms my productivity and I was already a very productive person.\
\
[00:09:50.710] - Eb Gargano\
But this hack took me to the next level and it's so powerful and so effective precisely because it's so simple. Because the thing is, if a system is complicated, then you won't end up using it and you'll resort back to keeping everything in your head or on that long, long list, or on those scrappy bits of paper. Or was it that has ever happened to you? Let me know in the chat if you've ever done that. If you've ever tried a complicated todo list system and then ended up not using it because it was so complicated and gone back to your old ways of doing things.\
\
[00:10:29.440] - Eb Gargano\
Well, the good news is that won't be a problem with this method done right, this todo list hack will help you make more money while working less, but it will also massively reduce your stress levels and feelings of overwhelm. And better still, it will make blogging fun again. What is it EV? I hear you cry. Okay.\
\
[00:10:53.970] - Eb Gargano\
Introducing the yearly action plan. I wish I could have thought up a fancier name for this, but I couldn't. So yearly action plan is what it is. If you can think of a better name for this spreadsheet, please do let me know in the chat. The Yearly Action Plan is just a super simple spreadsheet with 16 taps.\
\
[00:11:16.390] - Eb Gargano\
Don't worry if you're not a spreadsheet wiz. There are no complicated formulas. It is all just text. So the first tab is called Goals. On this tab you're going to write your big picture goals.\
\
[00:11:35.060] - Eb Gargano\
What do you really want from your blog? Why are you doing this rather than anything else you could be doing with your time? Why are you doing this rather than any other way of making money? Now, this talk isn't about goal setting, so I'm not going to go deep into goal setting right now. But this part is really important because until you get crystal clear on your big picture goals, you cannot be truly productive because you don't know what you're aiming for.\
\
[00:12:10.290] - Eb Gargano\
So if you're not clear on your goals, you will always feel overwhelmed and overworked and stressed and scattered because you don't have a clear idea about where you want to be. So this is going to look different to different people, but for most people, it will look like some combination of the following. Number one, earn a good income. You would obviously need to define what a good income means for you. Number two, have a good work life balance.\
\
[00:12:48.270] - Eb Gargano\
Most bloggers and online business owners I come across want to work less and want to be able to work more flexibly and have more control over their time. Again, you would need to define exactly what this looks like for you. Number three, enjoy what you do. There are many ways to earn money in this world. Most bloggers and online business owners do what they do because they want to spend their days doing a job they enjoy.\
\
[00:13:18.790] - Eb Gargano\
Number four, have a positive influence on a specific group of people. Again, for most bloggers, part of the motivation is about making a difference and having an impact. This part is really, really important. Please do not skip it because this is the yardstick by which you will evaluate all the possible tasks you could do, all the possible ways you could spend your time, and decide which activities will help you achieve your goals the best. And obviously, you will want to be a little more specific here than I've been.\
\
[00:13:56.470] - Eb Gargano\
And in fact, if you sign up for my freebie, which I'll be telling you about later, that will help you out with this part. Okay. So, the next tab is called the brain dump tab. Here is where I want you to put everything that's on your current to do list, everything that's on those scrappy bits of paper and everything that is in your brain, every task you feel you ought to be doing, I want you to put everything here. Don't leave anything out.\
\
[00:14:27.860] - Eb Gargano\
This is also really important because one of the reasons for feeling overwhelmed and scattered and stressed is because there's stuff all over the place, in your brain, on to do this, in some app somewhere, on scrappy bits of paper. Getting everything down in one place should be really cathartic and it's an absolute prerequisite for the next step. Okay. So, the next step is to reread your goals and then take a look at that great long list of everything and ask yourself, which are the tasks that are going to move the dial the most? Which are the activities and actions that are going to give me the most bang for my buck?\
\
[00:15:11.820] - Eb Gargano\
Which things are going to get me to my goals the best, the fastest? And this is really important, which things are going to get me to my goals in the most enjoyable way? Because I promised that this process would make blogging fun again. And that is part of the decision making here.\
\
[00:15:30.610] - Eb Gargano\
Now, here's the really important thing. I want you to pick no more than nine things from this brain dump list. You might have hundreds of things here, but you're only allowed to pick a maximum of nine. So, you're going to have to be really ruthless. Basically, you have to think in terms of if I could only do nine of the things on this list this year, which nine would I pick?\
\
[00:15:58.620] - Eb Gargano\
So, when you've chosen next, you are going to retype or copy and paste those nine things into tab three. These nine things are your most impactful tasks, or MITs for short. These are the things you are going to spend the majority of your time on over the next year. When I say the majority of your time, I mean 80% to 90% of your time. Because these are the things that are going to really move the dial.\
\
[00:16:29.710] - Eb Gargano\
These are the things that are actually going to get you to where you want to be, not all that other stuff you've been doing with your time. Now, the next step is to plan when you will do these nine things. So, you need to take a look at your most impactful tasks and think logically, what order makes the most sense? Let's look at an example.\
\
[00:16:49.390] - Eb Gargano\
Let's say, your MITs are create a course, launch that course, create a lead magnet for that course, create an evergreen sales funnel for your course, and sort out your email marketing, because it's a total mess at the moment. Well, to me, it would make logical sense to first sort out your email marketing. Then do market research to understand what your readers and subscribers want to learn from you. Then create a lead magnet that tests and validates our idea and gets the right kind of people onto your list.\
\
[00:17:23.500] - Eb Gargano\
Those lovely warm leads. Then create your course. Then launch your course. And then create an evergreen sales funnel for your course. So, my reorder MITs might look like this. Okay.\
\
[00:17:36.640] - Eb Gargano\
Then you're going to sign a month or two for each of these tasks. So, you need to be really realistic about how long these things will take you. So, for example, it might be that it's going to take a month to sort out your email marketing, then a month to do the market research and create that lead magnet. Then it might take two months to create your course, and then maybe month five is your launch and month six is when you create that evergreen sales funnel. Obviously, this is just an example to help bring this yearly action plan spreadsheet to life.\
\
[00:18:12.940] - Eb Gargano\
You might have very different things here. And the other thing I should say here, and the reason I've said only nine MITs, is you should also plan in some breaks, some proper time off to rest and recharge. Because that's the other reason why you might be feeling stressed and overwhelmed and why you feel like you're working too much because you're not taking proper time off. Rest is so important. In fact, rest is one of the best productivity tools.\
\
[00:18:44.250] - Eb Gargano\
Okay? So now it's time to look at this month by month. So, let's take month one. Month one in our example is getting your email marketing in shape. Because you know that the better your email marketing, the more courses you'll sell when you launch that course.\
\
[00:19:01.990] - Eb Gargano\
So, here, you need to do two things. You need to break down this month's MIT into smaller subtasks and you need to decide when you will do those things. And here, you need to be super specific because unless you actually plan exactly when you will do each task, it's unlikely to get done. You know that old [inaudible 00:19:27] age, don't you? A goal without a plan is just a wish.\
\
[00:19:30.910] - Eb Gargano\
Which is why you need to be super specific about what you will do and when you will do it. So, for month one, that might look like this. Notice how I've broken up my somewhat vague and loosely defined MIT of sort out email marketing into specific action steps. What do I mean by sort out email marketing and what specific subtasks do I need to do? I then put those subtasks in the order I think is most logical, and this is really important.\
\
[00:20:05.660] - Eb Gargano\
I have assigned a specific day and a specific week to each subtask. When you do this, you make your big MIT seem so much more manageable, but it also makes it much more likely you'll actually do each subtask, and so complete your MIT by the end of the month. I wonder if you have ever had a big vague task like sort out email marketing on your to do list for months or even years. Can you see how by getting super specific about what you need to do and when you're going to do it, you're going to be so much more likely to actually do that task rather than just keep putting it off and putting it off until some mythical one day in the future. Now don't worry, you don't need to plan all twelve months to this level of detail right now.\
\
[00:20:58.720] - Eb Gargano\
What I recommend you do for now is just write the MIT at the top of each of the future months with maybe just a few subtasks underneath. So, here's an example for month two. And here's the really cool thing. Every time, you have a good idea that relates to one of those future MITs, or if you read a really useful blog post, or if you see a really good ebook or course that would really help you, that relates to one of those future months, one of those future MITs, you're just going to quickly type that into the correct tab and then forget all about it.\
\
[00:21:36.460] - Eb Gargano\
Then at the end of each month, you can properly plan the next month just as we've done for month one. And you'll already have a whole bunch of useful stuff ready and waiting for you on that tab. Again, this is going to massively help with those feelings of stress and overwhelm because instead of trying to keep all those good ideas, all those blog posts and other useful stuff in your head, or on scrappy bits of paper, or in your inbox, you have a proper place to put them. And once you've put them there, you can forget all about those things until you come to plan that month. This will free up your headspace. And I cannot emphasize this enough, by freeing up more headspace, you will gain more bandwidth to focus on this month's tasks.\
\
[00:22:25.240] - Eb Gargano\
It's a simple productivity trick, but it's incredibly effective. Okay. So, I bet you're wondering about what to do about all the hundreds of things left on the brain dump tab. Okay. So, here is where you're going to need to be really ruthless because you're going to try and get rid of as many of those things as possible. Because remember, we've already planned in your most impactful tasks and those MITs are what you are going to be spending 80% to 90% of your time on. So, most of these activities on the brain dump tab you are going to have to get rid of completely because you don't have time to do them. Remember, your time is finite.\
\
[00:23:14.670] - Eb Gargano\
You cannot do everything, so you have to choose. By spending the majority of your time on your MITs, you know you are going to be doing the best possible things with your time. The stuff that's going to move the dial the most, the stuff that's going to give you the most bang for your buck. But it's always going to be a tradeoff.\
\
[00:23:35.970] - Eb Gargano\
If you choose to spend your time on one task, there won't be time to do other tasks. So that's why it's really important to choose to spend your time on the things that actually move the dial the most. And that's why you plan in your MITs first. If you don't, you'll fill up your time with all these other less impactful things and you'll never get to your most impactful tasks.\
\
[00:24:03.040] - Eb Gargano\
And if you spend all your time on tasks which don't move the dial much, you'll end up earning less and working more. Exactly the problem we set out to solve. Okay. So, with all these other things on tab two, you basically have five options, delete, minimize, delegate, automate, and delay. You need to work through every single task on this tab and decide whether you're just not going to do that activity. Or if you're going to minimize the activity, so it takes up very little of your time. Or if you're going to automate that activity in some way. Or if you're going to delegate that task, maybe to a VA. Or if you're going to delay that task, if you're going to put off that task for now and come back to it in the future when you've done your current MIT.\
\
[00:25:00.790] - Eb Gargano\
Now, I would love to go through this with you in more detail. I don't have time in this session. So, what I've done for you is I've created a free to do List Makeover Mini Course, which takes you step by step through this whole process and also includes the yearly action plan spreadsheet. You can access my free to do List makeover mini course by clicking the button or heading to productiveblogging.com/makeover. But there is one more tab on our spreadsheet that I want to talk about, and that's the next year tab. It may look simple and basic, but it's actually incredibly powerful.\
\
[00:25:43.180] - Eb Gargano\
First off, this is where you will move all of those tasks you've categorized as delay because some of the things on your brain dump tab are important tasks, which would really benefit your business, but they are not yet activities. You've picked your MIT for this year, but you know that these delay activities would make perfect MITs for next year. So, you can transfer them over onto the next year tab. But that's not all. You can also use this next year tab every time a new opportunity comes up and every time a new idea pops into your head, and every time you're tempted to ditch your plans entirely and chase after a new shiny object.\
\
[00:26:31.950] - Eb Gargano\
Instead of derailing your plans and chasing after those new shiny objects, you just write it on the next year tab and go back to what you were working on. You don't need to filter those ideas and opportunities in any way. You don't need to make any decisions about whether they're impactful tasks. In fact, I recommend spending as little time thinking about them as you can. Just add them to your next year tab and go straight back to what you are working on.\
\
[00:26:59.010] - Eb Gargano\
The reason why this works so well is because you're not saying it outright no to those good ideas and shiny objects. You're just saying, not yet. At the end of the year, you can then go into that next year tab and use it to help you with your planning for the following year. But crucially, you're not allowing those shiny objects to derail your carefully worked out plans for this year.\
\
[00:27:25.010] - Eb Gargano\
The next year tab also reduces stress and overwhelm and gives you a great place to store all of those good ideas safely. So, you can find them when you need them. I don't have much more detail about this in the free mini course, as well as what to do if a new opportunity presents itself midway through the year that's just too good to miss and can't be put off until next year. What to do about routine administrative tasks that just need to be done and what to do when stuff happens that isn't on your plan and needs immediate attention. Like, I don't know, if your website crashes or if your Google traffic takes a sudden nosedive, for example.\
\
[00:28:07.090] - Eb Gargano\
Remember, you can get my free to do list and makeover mini course, which takes you step by step through all we've covered in the session today in more depth, and that yearly action plan spreadsheet by hitting the button or heading to productiveblogging.com/makeover. After completing the to do list makeover mini course, you will have a clear idea of exactly what you want to achieve in 2023, a solid plan for how you will achieve your 2023 goals, and monthly action plans in place to ensure you actually follow through. Okay. So, finally, I just wanted to let you know where you can find me if you want more blogging and productivity tips. So, firstly, there's my blog, productiveblogging.com. You can also find me on Instagram, at productiveblogging, and on Twitter at Eb Gargano.\

**Transcript:**\
[00:00:13.550] - Speaker 1\
Hi, I'm Eb Gargano from Productive Blogging, and I am delighted to be speaking here at the Blogger Breakthrough Summit. I am super excited because I've been asked to speak on one of my favorite topics and that's productivity. In this jam pack session, I'm going to show you how you can 10x your productivity in just five steps. Let's dive in, shall we?\
\
[00:00:34.860] - Speaker 2\
So first up, for those of you who don't know me, my name is Eb Gargano and I am the blogger behind Easy Peasy Foodie and Productive Blogging, and I've been blogging since 2015, and in that time I have grown my food blog to over 1 million monthly page views. I have launched five successful online blogging courses with almost 2000 students enrolled. I also run two Facebook groups, and I managed to publish about 6-8 blog posts per month, plus send out 6-8 blog newsletters per month, as well as keep on top of two inboxes and nine social media accounts, and I earn a comfortable six-figure salary.\
\
[00:01:30.330] - Speaker 2\
And yet I work pretty much Monday to Friday, nine to five. I take time off during my kid's school holidays. I take most weekends off. I also take random midweek days off pretty much whenever I want to. I do outsource a couple of things, but 95% is done by me. I don't have a large team supporting me. I'm a soloprenure and people always ask me how, how do you do it? How do you get so much done? How do you achieve so much and yet still have a life?\
\
[00:02:14.960] - Speaker 2\
How are you so productive? Well, that is what this session is all about. I'm going to take you through five things that will help you 10X your productivity and help you achieve more while working less. But first I'd like you to meet three people. First up we have Anna the action taker. She's going to listen to this session, take copious notes, and take action on what I share. Starting today, a year from now she's going to be working less, achieving more, and hopefully seeing real results in her bank account.\
\
[00:02:55.270] - Speaker 2\
Okay, next up we have Susie sounds nice. She is going to listen to this talk. Say that sounds nice, but she won't put it into practice a year from now she'll still be working like a crazy thing and still not seeing results. And finally, we have Wendy won't work for me. She'll listen to this session and say, Nah won't work for me. She won't even give it a try. A year from now she's still going to be working like a crazy thing and still not seeing results.\
\
[00:03:32.510] - Speaker 2\
So which of these three characters are you going to be? Are you going to be Anna, Susie or Wendy? Go ahead and type the name into the chat and just to let you know this session is prerecorded so that I can be right in the chat with you. So if you have any questions as I go through this session, please ask away and I will answer as many as I can get to. Right. Then I'm hoping that you said, Anna, the action taker. Because if you take action on these strategies, I'm about to share with you, it might just change your life.\
\
[00:04:08.970] - Speaker 2\
So enough of the intro. Let's dive into the first of our five steps. Step one is to define what you want. Maybe that's not what you were expecting. Maybe you thought I'd be giving you some Ninja time management strategies. Well, we'll come on to that in a bit, but the thing is, if you don't know where you're heading or if you're heading in the wrong direction, it doesn't matter how well you manage your time. You're not being productive. The problem with so much productivity advice out there is it's not productivity advice in its true sense.\
\
[00:04:56.280] - Speaker 2\
It's efficiency advice while being efficient is good. It's not going to help you if you're doing the wrong things. That kind of advice is just going to help you get more and more efficient at doing the wrong things. Let's take the analogy of a car. You can get the fastest car. You can fill it with the best fuel you can take an advanced driving course. You can take the racing line on every single corner. But if you are heading in the wrong direction, none of that will help you.\
\
[00:05:31.710] - Speaker 2\
The first step in being truly productive is to define what you really want from your blogging business. So I'm going to make this first step really simple. If you're here at this summit learning how to be more productive. I'm pretty sure that the number one thing you want if you're really honest with yourself is money. Now, that might look slightly different for each of you. Maybe some of you want to earn enough to quit your nine to five, maybe some of you want to earn a nice part-time income.\
\
[00:06:12.030] - Speaker 2\
Maybe some of you want to earn a decent full-time income, and maybe some of you want to earn six, multiple, six, or even seven figures. But here's the thing. There are lots of ways you can earn money in this life. So why don't you choose to blog? If you're anything like me, then you have a few other goals. First up, you want to earn money in a way that you find enjoyable. You want to earn money in a way that allows you to help other people.\
\
[00:06:46.170] - Speaker 2\
Perhaps most importantly, you want to earn money passively or at least semi-passively, so that you can have flexibility over your timetable so that you can also do things like spend time with your family and friends, pursue your hobbies, take vacations, take random days off, go to your kids, end of time show. So did I get that right? Is that what you want to? Either way, let me know in the chat. The trouble is, that for most bloggers, it's the other way around. Perhaps that's you right now, you aren't making as much money as you want, and you're working way more hours than you want.\
\
[00:07:33.810] - Speaker 2\
Am I right? So how do we fix this? Keep listening, because I'm coming to that. Okay, so step one was to define what you want. Step two is to define how you are going to get there. So if what you want is to earn a decent income, do something you love helping your audience out with their problems, working flexibly and not working crazy hours, how do you achieve that? For me? As I've worked through these questions for myself, the conclusion I've come to is to focus on passive income strategies.\
\
[00:08:19.350] - Speaker 2\
And although nothing is ever 100% passive in the blogging world, by focusing on passive income strategies, I can work less. I can have more control over my time, and I can earn more because my income is not tied to the number of hours I have available in the day. And for me, what that looks like is a blend of ad income, affiliate income, and selling digital products. Now you might come to a slightly different conclusion, and that's totally okay. This session is not about me telling you what to do, but rather giving you the questions that you need to ask yourself.\
\
[00:09:02.900] - Speaker 2\
But whatever you decide, I would encourage you to focus on multiple income streams because none of us knows what lies around the next corner. And relying on just one income stream is a very precarious place to be. Okay, so you have defined what you ultimately want to achieve with your blog. You've defined how you're going to get there. Now it's time to move on to step three. Step three is to define the three most impactful tasks. Okay, so here's the thing. You can't do everything. There are just so many things that we could be doing as bloggers, I reckon I could employ an army of VA's and still not feel like I was doing everything.\
\
[00:09:58.440] - Speaker 2\
This is a really important mindset shift that you have to make if you want to be truly productive, it's so important that I'm going to repeat it. You can't do everything. And this is fundamental because it's only when you truly accept that you can't do everything that you realize you have to choose. And here's another important thing to get your head around. Some tasks are going to move the dial more than others. One of the biggest secrets to being truly productive is to pick the tasks that are going to have the biggest impact.\
\
[00:10:37.650] - Speaker 2\
Now, you may have heard of the 80 20 rule. I'm slightly paraphrasing here, but basically what it says is that 80% of your results are being driven by 20% of the things on your to-do list. Take a moment to stop and think about that. What would happen if you stopped doing all those low-impact tasks and did more of that 20% of tasks that are driving 80% of your results. That would be five X your productivity in one fell swoop. But we can do better because I'm willing to bet that some of the most impactful tasks aren't even on your dealership right now, and that's what step three is all about.\
\
[00:11:29.610] - Speaker 2\
Okay, so let's say you are like me, and you have decided that you are going to focus on the three passive income strategies I mentioned before, so that's ads, affiliates, and digital products. In this step, your task is to write down what you consider to be the three most impactful tasks you could do for each of those three monetization strategies. Now, obviously, this is going to depend on where exactly you are in your blogging journey right now. But here's an example. Let's start with Ads for most people.\
\
[00:12:04.720] - Speaker 2\
The way to get good money from ads is by focusing on SEO. So you might say here that the three most impactful strategies are keyword research, creating lots of new, high-quality blog posts based on that keyword research, and updating your old content. For affiliates, you might pick researching affiliate schemes in your niche, going beyond Amazon, and finding affiliate schemes with better Commission, maybe even recurring Commission. You might also pay to optimize your top 20 posts with relevant affiliate links. And finally, you might pick creating new content that targets buyer intended keywords.\
\
[00:12:48.810] - Speaker 2\
In other words, keywords, which the ideal customers for your affiliate products are typing into Google when they're in the mood to buy. And then for digital products, you might pick making a new product, building out an evergreen sales funnel, and working on growing your email list with a really good new lead magnet that's going to attract the perfect buyers for your new product. Again, these are just examples. You may come to very different conclusions, but if you've already thought of a few ideas, a few of those most impactful tasks, I would love to hear about them.\
\
[00:13:30.190] - Speaker 2\
So let me know in the chat. Okay, so now you have to find your most impactful tasks. The next step is to take those impactful tasks and turn them into an action plan. Now, obviously, you can't do all nine of those most impactful tasks all at once. So you're going to have to think about the most logical order to do them. In what order should you do these tasks for maximum impact? So let's continue with our example. Maybe you start by focusing on affiliate links so you can spend month one researching affiliate programs and optimizing your top 20 posts with affiliate links.\
\
[00:14:13.740] - Speaker 2\
And this will mean that those blog posts are going to be earning money for you passively or year long. You could also do some keyword research, and this will help you to identify those buyer intent keywords as well as other keywords which are going to drive traffic. So you can grow your blog and earn more ad income. Then maybe in month two, you might decide to focus on your digital product a little, maybe figuring out what you're going to create and then coming up with that awesome lead magnet so you can start growing your list with the perfect people.\
\
[00:14:51.600] - Speaker 2\
So that when you come to actually create and launch your product later in the year, you already have a ready-made list of red hot buyers. You might also decide to create a welcome sequence and or a nurture sequence to warm those new subscribers up and get them to know, like, and trust you. Maybe if your email marketing isn't really quite up to scratch, you might also do a bit of work getting that into shape. Then in month three, you might decide to focus on SEO updating old posts, and creating new posts based on your keyword research.\
\
[00:15:29.480] - Speaker 2\
And maybe you do that in month four too. So you do a really big push so you can get lots of new and updated posts ranking on Google and sending you traffic for the whole of the rest of the year. And then in month five, you might start working on your digital product and so on again. This is just an example. This might not be quite right for you. Use your logic and figure out what would be the best order to do your most impactful tasks so you get the most bang for your buck.\
\
[00:16:08.370] - Speaker 2\
Now you might be thinking this is more work got less. That's because we haven't got to step five yet. So step five is to remove from your Todo list everything which is not directly helping you achieve your goals for this year. This is where the magic happens. I want you to take your Todo list and also everything else that is still stuck inside your head that hasn't even made it to your dealers yet. Write all that stuff down and then take a long, hard look at it.\
\
[00:16:47.410] - Speaker 2\
What is not helping you hit those goals? What is not helping you achieve those nine most impactful tasks? Because we as bloggers, do a lot of busywork. Am I right? Busy work is either totally pointless stuff or stuff that's in that 80% of tasks that is only producing 20% of your results in order to make time to do the right thing. For Your most impactful tasks, you need to remove pretty much everything else off your to-do list. In other words, you need to remove everything that's not actually helping you drive your business forward.\
\
[00:17:32.110] - Speaker 2\
I'm warning you, it's going to be painful, but it's so worth it because you're taking off good things and replacing them with better things. You're taking off busy work and replacing it with effective work that's actually going to make a difference to your bottom line. Now, what you take off is going to be different for different people. So for example, for me, that's things like Instagram reels and TikTok and tidying my Pinterest boards and most sponsored post opportunities that come my way and doing coaching calls just to name a few.\
\
[00:18:14.570] - Speaker 2\
Now, most of those things are really good things are those are the best things for me to be doing with my time. Are those things that are going to give me the most bang for my buck? No, of course, you may come to completely different conclusions. Perhaps you are absolutely killing it on ticktock right now, and that is the thing that's going to give you the most bang for your buck. Again, you need to figure this one out for yourself, but be careful. It's very easy to start thinking that this kind of busywork is somehow essential.\
\
[00:18:55.270] - Speaker 2\
It's not. Remember, we are removing the good to make way for the better. So everyone I want you to type one thing into the chat that's coming off your Todo list. Okay, now, because I always like to over-deliver. There's a step six and step six is to test every new opportunity, every shiny new object against your plan, because stuff is going to come up. New opportunities, new, brilliant ideas that pop into your head. Stuff you see other bloggers doing, and you are going to be tempted.\
\
[00:19:40.460] - Speaker 2\
So tempted to add more stuff to your to-do list. And if you're not careful soon, you will be swamped with a whole new load of busy work and your most impactful tasks will be pushed to the side and probably never get done. You are going to have to be strict with yourself this year if you truly want to ten X your productivity. Now, I guess you might be thinking this is all well and good at, but I was hoping for some strategies to make me more efficient.\
\
[00:20:14.200] - Speaker 2\
Maybe some Ninja time management tips. But the truth is, I could have done that talk, but it would have been like giving you a bandaid for a broken leg without doing the steps I've outlined in this session. At best, those Ninja efficiency tips would have two X your productivity, and I promise to ten X your productivity. And the stuff I've talked about today is the stuff that's going to ten X your productivity. Only once you've done this stuff, only once you've worked through the five or rather six steps I've outlined in today's session.\
\
[00:20:49.220] - Speaker 2\
Will those Ninja efficiency tips truly help you now? Of course, I do have those Ninja time management strategies to help you be more efficient. And if I had an extra 30 minutes, I would give them to you. But I don't. So here's what I'd like to do. I'd like to give you a free copy of my ebook blog, Smarter, Not Harder. In part one of this book, I go through all the things we've covered in today's session, but in much more detail. And in part two, I share my Ninja efficiency strategies so you can get even more done in even less time.\
\
[00:21:28.640] - Speaker 2\
But I want you to promise me something. I want you to promise me you won't skip straight to part two, because if you do, the only thing that will happen is you'll get more efficient at doing the wrong things. Please, please take the time to do part one. That is the thing that will ten X your productivity. Then once you've done part one, part two is the thing that will turbocharge that once you are doing the right things, then supercharge that by working more efficiently to get my book, go to productive blogging.\
\
[00:22:08.810] - Speaker 2\
Com ebook. And then when you read it and start putting it into practice, I want you to email me at ebb at Productiveblogging dot. Com and tell me all about it. Okay. So remember our three friends. Are you going to be Anna the action taker? Of course, you are. In which case, go to Productivelogging. Com ebook and grab that ebook and then type into the comments, downloaded it, and then go read that book and put it into action. Do not put this on your maybe one day list.\
\
[00:22:43.970] - Speaker 2\
Do not download the ebook and then find it away and never read it. Download the ebook right now and start reading it and putting it into practice today. Strike while the iron is hot. Start while you are excited and motivated by this talk because if you download it and put it into practice might just change your life. And by this time next year, you could be in a place where you are working less and earning more. So just to recap, go to productiveblogging. Com ebook, download the book, then type into the comments, downloaded it, then go read that book and put it into action.\
\
[00:23:26.420] - Speaker 2\

\
**Transcript:**\
[00:00:09.600] - Elna Cain, twinsmommy.com\
Let's learn how to find time and write more blog post, because the more you write, you can make money blogging. All right. So my name is Elna Cain and I blog over at Twinsmommy, the twinsmommy is my third site and my second blog. All right.\
\
[00:00:30.270] - Elna\
Now, before this, I started innovative ink for my writing service. That's my first site. And then I started a new blog at elnacain for freelance writers. And then I started Twins Mommy in 2016 as an outlet to blog about working from home with twins.\
\
[00:00:45.810] - Elna\
All right. So this quickly grew to using twins mommy as a case study on my digital marketing knowledge and attracted other mom bloggers and twinsmommy formed into helping moms make money blogging.\
\
[00:00:57.660] - Elna\
So after twinsmommy, I started several other sites in various niches and I had fun ranking those blogs and growing their traffic.\
\
[00:00:57.660] - Elna\
So I thought I can come here and share some of my tricks and tactics for finding that time so that you can write more.\
\
[00:01:13.950] - Elna\
Now, these tactics are based on writing and so that you can speed up that process and streamline your process so that you can make more money.\
\
[00:01:22.290] - Elna\
All right. So let's get to it now.\
\
[00:01:24.360] - Elna\
The first thing that you can do that will immediately free up lots of time is to open up your blog for contributors.\
\
[00:01:31.980] - Elna\
Now, what do I mean by that? Well, I have two contributor sites.\
\
[00:01:35.910] - Elna\
One of them here is ImperfectlyPerfectMama and I have guest bloggers pitch me that they want to guest blog on this site and they give me the content and I put it on and I publish it. I get a feature image, a stock photo, and I just might gleam over it to add a couple of things. And there you go.\
\
[00:01:58.290] - Elna\
So. I decided that when I picked up this site, I didn't have that time to write, dedicate a good six months to writing my own content, so that is why I opened it up to contributors. All right. So like I said, I optimized the post for SEO. And because of that, I was able to grow the traffic to be eligible for Mediavine ads.\
\
[00:02:23.260] - Elna\
All right. So this is one of my niche sites that I get traffic to so that I can get monetized through ads. I have no email list associated with this.\
\
[00:02:35.050] - Elna\
I no, really, audience is just sort of a blog that they can get via Pinterest is where I market it the most. All right. So if you have an existing site or you're thinking about starting a new site, consider opening up that site for contributors because it is another diversified stream of income.\
\
[00:02:57.870] - Elna\
All right, so how do we do this? All right, so like I said, ImperfectlyPerfectlyMama was a new blog picked up and I didn't have the time to write, so I optimized it for SEO is one of the first things that I did with any new content that I had.\
\
[00:03:13.710] - Elna\
All right.\
\
[00:03:14.080] - Elna\
So, for example, if you type in alternatives to breastfeeding, I'm there in ImperfectlyPerfectMama has a post there and it's from a contributor.\
\
[00:03:22.860] - Elna\
So in order to start this process, you do need a couple of things. You need to have author bios at the end of your blog post and you can put them in manually, like the one on my right here. She this person that I guess posted for just made a little graphic.\
\
[00:03:40.920] - Elna\
And then underneath in the actual blog post, she just wrote my, author bio there you can use a plug in like the one here on the left.\
\
[00:03:48.720] - Elna\
You can find an author bio plug in if you're using WordPress and then just have that for every contributor post. Right. You're also going to need a canned email response to pitches.\
\
[00:03:58.470] - Elna\
So when people come and pitch to you, you have already a template, an email template to send out and then you do need a contributor information page on your site, sort of like a write for us page.\
\
[00:04:12.680] - Elna\
All right, so a great canned response in Gmail is easy to create. You write it all out in your email and then you can click the three dots at the end at the bottom there, and then it goes next to the trash, sorry, and goes to templates and then same draft as template and then a save as a new template. And then you can use that. And so this is what I have here for my canned email. You can take a look.\
\
[00:04:37.710] - Elna\
When I get these people who want to guest post, this is what I usually tell them. The process, the logistics.\
\
[00:04:48.090] - Elna\
I'll add you to the user profile and WordPress and then you can get a login information email to you. All right. And then I just tell them to write your blog post in the email or in the WordPress and then submit it for review.\
\
[00:05:06.940] - Elna\
All right, now on the right front page on your website, you can include what your blog niche is about what type of topics you want guests to write for. You can be specific on this contributor blog. I do say I specifically want saving money tips, self care tips, newborn toddler tips, postpartum tips, health tips and personal stories.\
\
[00:05:27.140] - Elna\
Those are the types of contents that I have been getting. So if you, for example, want to kick up and ramp up your SEO and you have certain keywords in mind, then you can put those out in here. Like I want things all about breastfeeding challenges and pregnancy scares. And, you know, I want those. Things to get ready for your big hospital trip as a pregnant person, you know, like you can add those sort of idea topics and then you can get guest posters to write those things for you.\
\
[00:06:01.000] - Elna\
And then the blog post format, so I tell them I want a thousand words, at least because that's good for ranking potential in Google, Google does want the most valuable type of content to share in the SERPs, in the search result pages.\
\
[00:06:16.870] - Elna\
And then that usually is long form writing. All right, in the background of WordPress, you can make a new user, so again, when someone pitches, they sign up, they look at the WordPress, write up page there, and they see the email address or contact form. And then you get the email and you send a canned response saying that you will set up this process, this profile for them.\
\
[00:06:42.300] - Elna\
So in the backend. You can just go and add a new user. And then make sure to get their information through that email, so their email address, their name, their blog, and if they have a gravatar associated with it, with that email address, if they don't, then you can just ask for headshot. And then at the bottom, make sure to change this role from subscriber to contributor so that they can actually contribute to your blog.\
\
[00:07:10.650] - Elna\
All right. Now, the second way you can save time is by repurposing your content. All right. So I hope that the first thing of opening up your blog to contributors is something that you'd be thinking about.\
\
[00:07:24.870] - Elna\
You don't have to make an entire contributor blog, but you can open it up maybe every month you can have two guest posts and then you can write two posts. Again, that saves time for you. All right. And then this way, I use this method a lot because I do have several blogs and several email lists and several Facebook pages, and I just need ways to repurpose what I've already created.\
\
[00:07:56.820] - Elna\
All right.\
\
[00:07:57.180] - Elna\
So you can repurpose old blog posts, emails or videos.\
\
[00:08:00.870] - Elna\
So like I said over my freelance writing blog, since I have over 100 blog posts, I take some of those points from a few blog posts and put that in a new email for my email list.\
\
[00:08:12.930] - Elna\
So, for example, over here is a blog post on 11 Ways to stay positive as a new freelance writer. It was written a while back, and so in my email that I send out, I might have a little blurb.\
\
[00:08:25.490] - Elna\
So here how you can stay positive during your new journey to freelance writing.\
\
[00:08:29.310] - Elna\
And then I give a couple of those tips that I put that were already in this blog post, and I may add more relevant information that's more current. All right. But I do repurpose those things and I might add only three.\
\
[00:08:42.570] - Elna\
And I may link to that post if you want more ideas to stay positive.\
\
[00:08:47.730] - Elna\
Check out my, my post here and then I would link to this post. You can do that as well.\
\
[00:08:53.380] - Elna\
Now, don't worry, not every email subscriber has read your entire blog.\
\
[00:08:57.780] - Elna\
So if you're worried about that, you can use old blog posts as idea starters then or add more to them in email.\
\
[00:09:05.250] - Elna\
So again, I wouldn't worry too much about that because you're repurposing your content that people are just going to think that you're repurposing content, find a way to use it in a new medium.\
\
[00:09:19.050] - Elna\
So turn a blog post into a Facebook live video, for example. You can do that or vice versa. Summarize a Facebook live video. All right.\
\
[00:09:28.890] - Elna\
And then you can drop an email about that. You can also repurpose parts of a blog post into a brand new post. All right.\
\
[00:09:39.510] - Elna\
So since my freelance writing blog is a highly niche site for freelance writing and writing jobs, I often write about the same topics over and over again.\
\
[00:09:48.970] - Elna\
OK, my entire blog on elnacain, which is my freelance writing site, is all about getting started, freelance writing.\
\
[00:09:55.800] - Elna\
And I've had that site for many years now and I still write about the same topics about jobs.\
\
[00:10:04.110] - Elna\
Becoming a writer and writing tips basically.\
\
[00:10:07.530] - Elna\
So to make each post unique, I have to pull from existing posts and add more to them or put a spin to them. So I often write about practicing writing in many posts. So a lot of the things that I teach is, you know, make sure that you practice writing every day.\
\
[00:10:22.170] - Elna\
That's something I say constantly throughout my blog posts.\
\
[00:10:26.490] - Elna\
So I naturally created a blog post on improving your writing skills. All right. So, for example, up here, practice writing, the third subtopic was in a blog post that I wrote. And then I have it here write every day. It's just structured differently. Right. So you can do repurposing that way. All right. And repurposing also, you can do with video.\
\
[00:10:50.730] - Elna\
So the third method, you can save time. With your writing is use video instead. All right, so Facebook lives are easy ways to create content when you really don't have time to write a post. I use video a lot when I just physically don't have an hour or two to write a blog post. Right.\
\
[00:11:11.010] - Elna\
So, as I say, can take up to three hours for me to write a long piece of article. So but it only takes me about 30 minutes to do a Facebook live, mostly twenty five minutes.\
\
[00:11:21.620] - Elna\
So if I know I can't write, I don't have a block of time, I start doing quick videos to keep my audience up to date with my life, but to also be in the minds of my readers often.\
\
[00:11:32.210] - Elna\
All right. So you can do an Instagram live if you want. You can even do like the Instagram reel's doesn't have to be like a live video at the time.\
\
[00:11:42.560] - Elna\
You can post a YouTube video or do a Facebook live.\
\
[00:11:46.220] - Elna\
All right. So Facebook lives they're for me, the easiest ways to create content when I don't have time to write a post so as I was saying, takes up to three hours for me to write. So here I have a video that I did over in my Facebook group, Mom to Mompreneurs, it's the first step to SEO for new bloggers. And then, I don't know, I'd say probably a few months later, I created a blog post called What is SEO: Getting Your Site ranking in 2020.\
\
[00:12:16.670] - Elna\
So then this was the video that I got inspired by to write that post. And in that post I put the video in it. All right, so we covered repurposing.\
\
[00:12:30.560] - Elna\
So think about all the different ways that you can start repurposing your content, using video to write a blog post, using a video to create an email, using a video to create another video.\
\
[00:12:41.240] - Elna\
Maybe you can do sort of like a pre step of the of the video that you just did kind of thing.\
\
[00:12:49.250] - Elna\
All right. You can do a blog post, a video blog post, an email, lots of different ways to repurpose your content.\
\
[00:12:54.980] - Elna\
The fourth way you can save time with writing is to create a series. And I like to do this at least once a year. So and it's a fun way for me to creating a series over the same topic. So for me, I can focus on one aspect or several aspects for each blog post, and I can make each one around 800 to 1000 words.\
\
[00:13:15.530] - Elna\
So sometimes having five 800 word blog posts, so like one every week is better than having no blog posts for two months.\
\
[00:13:25.040] - Elna\
So think about that. Even though they're shorter pieces of content, they're delivered more consistently. That is good for your blog than to not write anything for a few months because you're writing this big, big, huge guide.\
\
[00:13:38.060] - Elna\
So I usually run my blog series at the end of the year during the holidays it seems things are pretty slow right before the new year for me.\
\
[00:13:45.990] - Elna\
So I like to just I have a bit of time to just drum up a theme and then create a series over it. So one year I did Pinterest all about Pinterest marketing. And so I did 12 days, six to 12 days of Christmas, 12 days of blog posts for you.\
\
[00:14:01.730] - Elna\
And every single day I posted a blog post and they're all different topics, all about Pinterest, one about description's, ones about hashtag, sections, how to get more saves, mistakes, how you can make money, Podcasts for bloggers that are about Pinterest.\
\
[00:14:22.190] - Elna\
I mean, I just sort of sat there and drummed up what I wanted to write about for you.\
\
[00:14:28.160] - Elna\
You can find blog post ideas around a topic using Pinterest. So, for example, if you want to do a series on breast feeding advice for your parenting blog, you can search that topic on Pinterest and check out the tiles to get blog post ideas. So breastfeeding tips here in Pinterest. And underneath, there's all these beautiful little tiles that can give you some ideas. So I just quickly looked at that and I was able to get these topics five ways to quickly boost milk supply when breastfeeding, the best breast pump for new moms that can be monetized while, eight breastfeeding mistake's beginners may not know about how to use a HACA to get more milk in a day.\
\
[00:15:03.020] - Elna\
Five easy ways to get your newborn latching the first time.\
\
[00:15:05.660] - Elna\
How to get a deplage when breastfeeding, and how to gently wean your baby from breastfeeding.\
\
[00:15:10.580] - Elna\
Now, some of these can be sort of like a ultimate guide for sure, but you can structure them in a way so that they're just easy little pieces of content to consume. All right. So the five ways to quickly boost milk supply, that could be like, you know, 800 words of these five cool little hacks that you have and then you can link to your bigger guides in that post. If you do have like a big guide on boosting milk supply, OK, you can also get ideas through keywords, right.\
\
[00:15:42.440] - Elna\
So you can use something like a free keyword tool like ubersuggest to get just some blog ideas. So I have the best breastfeeding tips for latching, breastfeeding tips for your newborn, five breastfeeding tips for short nipples. Now, the one the one thing using something like a keyword tool like this, like Ubersuggest I mean, you do have to plug in different types of keywords to get more ideas. So I just typed in breastfeeding tips and it just gave me.\
\
[00:16:09.190] - Elna\
LongTail keywords for breastfeeding tips, breastfeeding tips and newborn breastfeeding tips and new moms breastfeeding tips, and so I wouldn't rely solely on a keyword tool like this Pinterest seems to be a better option.\
\
[00:16:22.450] - Elna\
Now, the fifth way this does involve writing a bit more, but it's writing easy blog posts for high engagement.\
\
[00:16:30.190] - Elna\
All right. Now, the popular posts that are easy to write are list posts, OK, list posts come in all different forms. They are roundup of contributors. You can have a big roundup and have, you know, 70 bloggers or 70 artists or 70 moms contribute.\
\
[00:16:47.170] - Elna\
You can feature others instead. You can make it a huge resource. So it's a resource list post of all the tools you need to start selling or all the tools you need to work from home kind of thing.\
\
[00:17:02.200] - Elna\
It could be all about products. OK, so you can round up the best courses for, you know, learning how to sing or something like that.\
\
[00:17:11.530] - Elna\
And they can also be affiliate based, so again, you can have a roundup of the best baby bottles and then those are all affiliates.\
\
[00:17:20.570] - Elna\
So I generally write list posts as they're highly shareable and easy to write for me personally.\
\
[00:17:26.140] - Elna\
So once you have that topic, you want to list out the subtopics and write a few sentences for each. So if your post isn't long enough, like over 300 words, that's pretty much a the low end of a list post. You can add more to that list over time. All right. That's pretty much what I do. I may not start out with 87 crafts. I think I started out with like 60 or 63 crafts. And then I gradually updated it every few months or a year or something like that.\
\
[00:17:56.750] - Elna\
So now it's 87 crafts, I think the last time was 73. And then before that was probably sixty two or sixty three.\
\
[00:18:04.800] - Elna\
I also have 63 ways to live on one income. Again, this one I think I wrote all 63 ways.\
\
[00:18:11.400] - Elna\
This one took a bit of time, so I added over time. One hundred and seventy indoor and outdoor toddler activities. All right. So these high list posts. You can start with 20 and then every month or every quarter add 10 or 15 more so that by the end of the year it is a nice, beefy post. And that's when you can really start marketing it, create new pins for it, tell your list about it, because now it's you wrote it in January, but now it's, you know, November kind of thing.\
\
[00:18:41.640] - Elna\
All right, and usually this post get the most share as people just like to bookmark them, and so they'll just save them to their Pinterest boards or share them on Facebook kind of thing. Now, if you decide to feature other bloggers because you're pressed for time so you don't have the time to actually write all this stuff, you just want people to, like, tell you their their contribution, you can post in various Facebook groups or tell your list, your email list or personally email bloggers so you can ask them if they want to contribute.\
\
[00:19:13.750] - Elna\
And this is what I did of Michelle, of Making Sense of Cents. I mean, I was able to easily get her contribution just by emailing her. So I said, I love your blog and your Pinterest group.\
\
[00:19:27.760] - Elna\
I know you're the queen of affiliate marketing and congrats on your course. So I talk about my blog and I say that I'm doing a series and that I asked em if she's interested. Right.\
\
[00:19:42.260] - Elna\
So Michelle's VA or herself responded to that email and they contributed to my post, so I'm pretty sure Michelle, her VA sort of rounded up all the you know, she gets asked probably to do a lot of contributions.\
\
[00:19:55.220] - Elna\
And so she spends a week or more with, like, writing these responses for all her contributions.\
\
[00:20:02.370] - Elna\
And this is what she wrote for mine.\
\
[00:20:03.440] - Elna\
It's pretty detailed and nice on my post on Twins'Mommy. So this saves me a lot of time in writing.\
\
[00:20:10.760] - Elna\
And this will help grow your audience when you get influencers like Michelle of Making Sense of Cents to contribute to your posts, because then you can ask other influencers to contribute to that post. While I have these are the people that are contributing, you know, Michelle, Making Sense of Cents and, you know, Sarah Titus of sarahtitus and and you can list off these influencers. And so it'll get more traction. People will want to associate themselves with those influencers and want to contribute to your post.\
\
[00:20:41.660] - Elna\
All right, so the sixth way is to share one or two tips for curiosity.\
\
[00:20:49.430] - Elna\
Now, this does work really well if you have really good, juicy tips.\
\
[00:20:54.770] - Elna\
OK, so if you're pressed for time, then you can create a blog post on one or two tips, but try to make it at least a thousand words to make it valuable.\
\
[00:21:02.240] - Elna\
OK, because sometimes long list posts are daunting and they cause anxiety. Well, I know it does for me at times when I do, you know, browse Pinterest and see like two hundred and eighty, you know, blogging tips or 2,080, you know, traffic tips, I get a little overwhelmed. Like that's going to be a big post.\
\
[00:21:23.150] - Elna\
I don't have the time to read it. And so a lot of people just want a quick win. And you can do that with a blog post that shares only one or two tips.\
\
[00:21:32.540] - Elna\
And you have to frame your headline so that it builds curiosity. And this is what I did with this blog post of 2 little unknown SEO hacks for new bloggers.\
\
[00:21:43.730] - Elna\
These are unknown, not many people talk about these little hacks that I have in this blog post, and so that drove a lot of curiosity and people commented on this blog post and shared it. All right.\
\
[00:21:56.400] - Elna\
So when you start thinking of a nice, valuable tip, you might have a cool hack when your meal prepping to speed up to speed up the process, meal a hack for organizing things like that.\
\
[00:22:08.810] - Elna\
Then you can you can structure like the the number one thing I always use to get such and such and such.\
\
[00:22:17.030] - Elna\
Right. You can frame it that way. All right, and then the last tip is to know the keywords in your niche.\
\
[00:22:27.530] - Elna\
This is important if you start blogging and you're just randomly trying to figure out topics and and keyword research, it's going to be hard to get that initial boost in Google for that traffic. It's much easier to already have like a list of keywords that are searchable and that are ready made for you.\
\
[00:22:49.790] - Elna\
All right. So. For many bloggers, writing a blog post usually starts with that idea right in mind, and from there you start researching your topic, but it is a long process. So instead of writing your post this way, start having the keywords in your niche already created.\
\
[00:23:05.740] - Elna\
And that will help you easily write blog posts every week for months.\
\
[00:23:09.070] - Elna\
And I do want to introduce you to my little guide here. It's two hundred and sixty easy keywords to rank for.\
\
[00:23:17.140] - Elna\
It comes with an editorial calendar and SEO blog post format and promotion plan flow chart, the link.\
\
[00:23:25.150] - Elna\
You'll get the link. And here's a little graphic of it.\
\
[00:23:27.790] - Elna\
I mean, there's my calendar right here. And then I have about 17 various niches. I think three of them are our core niche sites and the rest are popular niche sites.\
\
[00:23:41.980] - Elna\
All right.\
\
[00:23:42.370] - Elna\
So this guide will be updated periodically to give fresh keywords, fresh ideas. And I also give you tons of blog posts, ideas for each niche.\
\
[00:23:53.950] - Elna\
I think I pick four keywords and then I give you blog post ideas within that niche.\
\
[00:23:59.740] - Elna\
All right. So many of these are popular mom blog niches like parenting or breastfeeding or homeschooling, things like that.\
\
[00:24:07.840] - Elna\
And just a quick thing to let you know that once you have those keywords in your niche, it's really easy to create blog posts.\
\
[00:24:14.230] - Elna\
So, for example, in WordPress, I just have a running list of keywords with the search result numbers. And then I just sort of. I add a color so I know that I've done them or contributors have, this is another contributor site that I have. So if I have a contributor to write it, then I will mark it.\
\
[00:24:39.050] - Elna\
So these are my other keywords that I want to eventually write for this this blog that I have its contributors site.\
\
[00:24:44.930] - Elna\
All right. So there you go.\
\
[00:24:46.340] - Elna\
Those are the seven main ways to find that time so that you can keep on blogging, since content is the main driver to get sales conversions on your blog and readership as well. All right.\
\
[00:25:01.490] - Elna\
So I hope you enjoy this.\

[00:00:11.850] - Liz\
I'm super excited to have this next speaker back with us. She is fantastic. She's the founder of the Out of Office Entrepreneur where she helps creative entrepreneurs customize and automate their businesses, so that they can spend more time out of office. After starting her own business back in 2012 and finding that she was glued to her computer 24/7, I can relate, she started simplifying and systemizing her businesses. Now she runs a six figure business and works just ten hour weeks without a team and wants to help other creative entrepreneurs do the same. Big warm welcome to Erin Flynn. Erin, thank you so much for coming back.\
\
[00:00:46.080] - Erin\
Thank you so much for having me. I'm really excited to chat today.\
\
[00:00:49.420] - Liz\
Yes. Because I think, I mean when you work for yourself, there's always one more thing and it's a very easy to stay glued to your computer. One of the things I want to talk about though, specifically is email because it gets, because you subscribe to things to learn and you subscribe to tools and then things change and it's just a hot, mess and there's a gazillion things. What would you say is the biggest problem people have in terms of managing email as an entrepreneur?\
\
[00:01:18.850] - Erin\
I think that they don't really like do any organization until their emails come in. So, they have all of their subscriptions, all of their login information, things from clients or sponsors or, you know, depending on how they run their business, everything is coming into one place, but with absolutely no organization and how that is. So, it's easy to miss important things like if you need to pay something or if somebody needs to pay you. And questions, support questions, if you sell products or services or something, those are really easy to miss when you have just an inbox completely full and nothing organized.\
\
[00:02:02.870] - Liz\
Yeah. So, almost like if you're always doing reactive organizing because that's a big problem I have. I can either go in and I can like organize my email or I can actually respond to them and I can't seem to do both in the same sitting. So, what would you recommend to kind of be more proactive in managing email?\
\
[00:02:24.830] - Erin\
So, I think the easiest thing that anybody can do right away is use a different email address. Like a totally different one is my advice for subscriptions and login information because typically when you sign up for something, you're going to be added to their email list anyhow. So, anything, you know, that's going to put you on an email list. I prefer to have that in a completely different email account, just like, you know, a classic Gmail. So, if you change your domain name or something later, you're not going to lose your login information. I can't tell you how many times I've seen that happen before too, where somebody's using like, amazingsite.com for their, you know, email and their website and then they're like, I'm going to rebrand to this. But they don't switch everything over. So just...\
\
[00:03:13.950] - Liz\
Or forward.\
\
[00:03:14.310] - Erin\
...Or forward, yeah. So, just, you know, use a nice gmail that you're not ever going to get rid of and that will work really well for like your logins, your subscriptions, all of that kind of stuff.\
\
[00:03:22.530] - Liz\
Okay, so next question is that because I have rebranded different domains in the past for one of my sites, and I now have just a gazillion email addresses, like so so many, I'd have to count, but I'd say at least ten. What would you recommend, someone who's in that same boat? Because when you do change domains, you keep the old domain generally or, you know, to have it forward to the new one. And ideally, you have the emails forwarded, or at least you still have access to the email through the hosting company. But when you have that many email addresses, how do you suggest condensing or just yeah, like, what should I do? Well, surprise, you start doing this a little bit, but I'm curious what your thoughts are.\
\
[00:04:07.870] - Erin\
Surprisingly, a lot of people do not do the forwarding. They just get rid of their domain and forget it. They like, signed up for things. I've seen this a lot, so don't do that. Don't just get rid of your domain without making sure that all of your emails are going somewhere else. I definitely recommend, you know, holding onto your domain for a couple of years if you rebrand, at least. And then I think the easiest thing, obviously is setting up forwarding is great, but it kind of makes sense to like tag things as they come in. So, for example, let's say you have example emails are going to hello@example.com, and you've now got superawesomesite.com, or whatever, right?\
\
[00:04:46.940] - Liz\
Yeah.\
\
[00:04:47.400] - Erin\
So if you see an email like have set up, if you use Gmail or I'm sure you can do this in others as well. I use Gmail specifically, and you can create a tag, so that if something comes into example.com, it will get a tag applied and it can have a special color on it. And then you know that I've got to go back into this account and update my email address, so that I can not get these emails at this account anymore. And eventually, let's say you make it a bright yellow tag. Eventually, as you work your way through those, you're not going to see bright yellow tags in your inbox anymore, so you're not going to have to like, hang on to that domain for the rest of your life.\
\
[00:05:27.270] - Liz\
Okay, so taking a step back, actually, because you mentioned Gmail, I know for a long time, when I first started my site, I just used the Imail or whatever it's called on Mac. But then when I started working with a VA, she couldn't access things that way, so I did kind of switch to Gmail. Is Gmail what you would recommend? Is there certain email platforms you think are better than others or ones to avoid in terms of your inbox?\
\
[00:05:54.140] - Erin\
I think Gmail is a really great one for most creative entrepreneurs because it's reasonably priced at $6 a month for a domain email. So, you know whatever your website is. And you can create aliases in addition to that, which we can talk about more, like how you can use aliases to auto organize your inbox, but you can have, like, hello and support and payments, you know, all going in. And it doesn't cost extra for those aliases. It does cost extra to add, like, a VA or somebody like that to have their own account, but I think $6 a month is a really reasonable price. Plus, it's easy to organize. You can access it from anywhere. You can add team members as needed, and of course, it can sync to all of the other Google things. So, I do recommend Gmail. There are other great platforms out there, and you can take a lot of, like, what we're talking about today and apply them there as well. But I think Gmail is, again, like, a really easy platform to use, and it's what I would recommend unless you have really extensive needs, in which case I don't actually know what the best platform would be if you have like a huge team, but I think most of us are solo preneurs or have a small team, and Gmail is perfect for that.\
\
[00:07:10.680] - Liz\
Yeah, I think most people have some familiarity with Gmail, even if they don't have it through their domain based email. They may not be familiar with Google Workspace, which is what you end up signing up for when you do that. Okay, so let's get back to aliases, because I feel like I've heard this before, and I've tried implementing it in the past, and I've failed miserably.\
\
[00:07:32.750] - Liz\
Partly, because I think I can never just remember what they I don't know. But anyway, can you give us a little more information on what an alias in Gmail is, as well as kind of how to best implement and use them?\
\
[00:07:45.890] - Erin\
Yeah, so there are lots of great ways you can do this. The way that I learned, I think I actually learned from Jordan Gill of System saved me. I feel like that's where I heard about it, but I can't find where she talked about it.\
\
[00:08:00.740] - Liz\
No, I think I have same thing. I think that's where I first heard of it, too. Like she did part of a bundle or something, I feel like.\
\
[00:08:07.130] - Erin\
Yeah, I think there was something that she did at one time that, maybe no longer exist, where she talked about using aliases. And it was this really incredible organizational moment for me. I was like, oh, thank you, Jordan. This is amazing. But basically what you can do is you create your account, your main account. So, for example, my main account for my personal brand is hello@erinflynn.com. Then I can also use payment@erinflynn.com as an alias, and for that, I would use things like, sign up for PayPal and Stripe and those emails from them. I would then create a filter and auto tag them, so that I know that it's a payment related email if they email me. So, anything that goes to payments@erinflynn.com is auto tagged, in my case, it's green for money. So, I'm like, oh, that's a money related thing. And I love being able to look in my inbox and just see the colors and know what different emails are, because then I can kind of, if something goes to support@erinflynn.com, it's tagged in red. Because I know that's a client or a student reaching out to me, and I want to make sure that they get top priority.\
\
[00:09:15.710] - Erin\
So, you can use these aliases with a filter and a tag to basically auto organize all of the emails that come into your inbox. The real trick is making sure you actually use those emails in the appropriate place, so that this happens and that's something that's harder to do the farther you get into business and the more accounts you have, like spread throughout the internet. But if you are newer to business, I'd highly recommend setting this up like early on, so that you don't have to deal with this later when you get, you know, hundreds of emails per day. And if you are further into business, start with just like one, start with switching whatever is most important. Probably support for most of us, if we have products, would be the most important thing to have auto tagged and liked marked in your inbox as something urgent to take care of. So, you would just like update your wherever students or customers contact you, you would just change it to support@example.com and make sure you have that tag and filter set up. And then if that's all you do, it's really going to make a big difference in being able to find those important emails.\
\
[00:10:27.230] - Liz\
Those are definitely some of the steps I missed, like setting up the alias but then not having the auto tag and stuff. I will say quick caveat, if you later want to establish a separate inbox for support@example.com, or in my case, support@elizabethstapleton.com, you have to delete the alias in the other one or let you do it. I was like, why is this not working? Because I had someone come in to manage that specifically. But yeah, so just quick tip there. But in order to make aliases work, you need to make sure you take the second step of tagging and setting up some rules. It sounds like, in my head I'm like, this is the fourth year doing the summit and I should really have an alias that's like summit, so that I can immediately find those emails because I'm constantly like, I need to stay on top of those. Okay, so, auto tagging and filters, those are two different things. I think we've talked about auto tags and how it relates to aliases and being able to quickly get at a glance of your inbox. How do you use filters? What's the benefit of those?\
\
[00:11:34.220] - Erin\
So, the filters, I actually keep mine really simple. And I know it's hard when we're just talking about it and you can't see my inbox. It can be hard to picture, like, how things look. But overall, I use the, so like filter to auto apply the tag. So, if somebody sends an email to support@erinflynn.com, I have a filter that's set up where if it's sent to that email address specifically, it auto applies the tag, and then I just have my tag set up in different colors. But that's basically the main way that I use filters, and I don't really have, there are some really cool filtering things you can do that get quite complex that I don't actually really spend time with. I pretty much just do like, the Alias rule, and if it goes to this address, this filter is applied. Something some people do, and I think a lot of people recommend, is they auto filter it into a folder, and it skips the inbox and it goes into a folder. And I don't personally like that because I didn't lose it forever. I forget to check my folders, so I like everything to go into my inbox, and then when I hit archive, it will just magically go into the folder.\
\
[00:12:45.750] - Erin\
But there are so many cool filters out there. Like if anybody wants to dive into Gmail filters, just Google Gmail filters and you will find this world of amazing possibilities.\
\
[00:12:58.390] - Liz\
Okay. Would you mind if I share my screen showing you where people can find these in Gmail? We won't actually set anything up because I'm pretty sure my VA, who set up all my various filters and stuff, would kill me. So, this is in Gmail, real quick, I believe Alias says you would pull into the you have to go into the workspace for, don't you?\
\
[00:13:22.770] - Erin\
Yes, it's in the, like the admin console.\
\
[00:13:25.310] - Liz\
Yeah, the admin console. So, you would go into your admin console and you would go create...\
\
[00:13:30.850] - Erin\
An alternate email address.\
\
[00:13:32.550] - Liz\
...Yeah, right there. Email alias. So, if you're wondering what that is, there you go. Okay, so back over here. Settings would be my guess, maybe.\
\
[00:13:41.980] - Erin\
Yeah, if you go to settings and all Settings.\
\
[00:13:47.450] - Liz\
Okay.\
\
[00:13:48.040] - Erin\
And then you have filters and blocked addresses.\
\
[00:13:53.780] - Liz\
Okay.\
\
[00:13:55.210] - Erin\
So, you already have some set up.\
\
[00:13:57.390] - Liz\
These were not me. These are my VA settings up because she was tired of stuff. That's ridiculous. But yeah. Okay. All right.\
\
[00:14:07.950] - Erin\
Yeah. If you create a new one at the bottom, you can walk through all of the steps, and there are so many things that you can do. For example, if you do the two line is kind of what I'm talking about. So, if it goes to support at elizabethstapleton.com, you can then start creating a filter. There's a create filter. So, I don't do anything else there. I just do Create filter, and then I don't skip the inbox. Some people do, but you can do label. Yeah, label and then whatever labels you have set up. So, I think you have to set up, if I'm remembering correctly, you set up your labels first, and then you can apply those.\
\
[00:14:45.600] - Liz\
You can actually do new labels.\
\
[00:14:46.800] - Erin\
There you go.\
\
[00:14:47.360] - Liz\
There we go. Okay.\
\
[00:14:48.890] - Erin\
And so, then you can label it as support or payments or whatever would be the appropriate one for that address. Then you would just click create filter, and it would magically be tagged whenever you get an email to that address.\
\
[00:15:01.620] - Liz\
Okay, I'm going to not do that because I don't want my VA mad at me. In theory, I'm the boss, but in reality, I'm like, what do you need me to do? Okay. All right. Anything else you kind of want to talk about while I'm sharing my screen?\
\
[00:15:20.710] - Erin\
I did mention that I like to color coordinate things. So, if you have labels and you hover over your labels on the left hand side and you click the three dots, you can do the label color.\
\
[00:15:32.140] - Liz\
Okay.\
\
[00:15:32.940] - Erin\
And so, for example, support. Like I said, I make it red, so it stands out in my inbox. And I know I got to take care of this. This is a priority, but you can just choose any color you want. You can add custom colors if you already know.\
\
[00:15:44.360] - Liz\
And definitely, like a visual color coding is a big thing. I don't think my VA is, I love her.\
\
[00:15:51.630] - Erin\
That color coding thing is really, like, key for me. And the way my brain works when I'm just going through my inbox, I know if it's red, I need to respond right away. And if it's any other color, it's not necessarily a priority. So, if I've got limited time, I don't have to necessarily do anything that's not red.\
\
[00:16:08.870] - Liz\
Okay. Got it. Okay, good to know. It looks like she set up a thing for me. I'm feeling very embarrassed right now. Okay. I'm going to stop sharing my screen. My system does work, guys. It works because I have someone helping me. Karen is so good, she doesn't need it. But yeah, okay. All right, so now we've talked about sort of proactively organizing your email. So, you know what, when you jump in there, you're like, okay, what's red? Any tips or advice on making sure, maybe you don't have time to get to the things that aren't read, making sure those aren't lost in the shuffle or forgotten or missed? \
\
[00:16:51.780] - Erin\
Yes. So, there's basically a two minute rule which comes from the book. Getting shit done, I believe, is the title. I have to double check that, but I can send you a link after this.\
\
[00:17:06.020] - Liz\
I think I've read the book. I don't know that the rule from there, but it might be.\
\
[00:17:08.890] - Erin\
Yeah, but it's basically like, if it takes two minutes or less, just do it, like on the first time you open the email or whatever it is. Like, it applies to anything in life. But in terms of email, if you click on it, it's going to take you less than two minutes to take action on it. Don't close that email. Just do the thing and move on. And I found that to be really helpful in terms of like just getting like, you can set a timer for 15 minutes, or if you've got a toddler like I do, you can do like a 15 or 20 minutes video that they're going to watch and they're going to be busy for that time. And you just get through all of those emails, like every single email that you can. And then if it's something that's going to take longer than two minutes, I schedule that time into my calendar to actually do that thing. So, I have like a block of time each week where basically, I'm like, let's take action on these things that people have sent me that I need to take action on. And you can do this as either, like, scheduling the actual things.\
\
[00:18:10.030] - Erin\
If somebody's like, oh, I need you to write a guest post for this and you want to write the guest post, then maybe you actually schedule the time to write the guest post. But you can also just have a block of time that's to take action on all these little tiny miscellaneous things that are sitting around in my inbox.\
\
[00:18:25.880] - Liz\
That reply to, you know, emails that need reply.\
\
[00:18:29.030] - Erin\
Yes, exactly.\
\
[00:18:31.650] - Liz\
Okay, so when you're scheduling [inaudible 00:18:33] calendar because sometimes you need the emails of reference point, are you literally pulling in the email into a calendar thing in Google Calendar? Like what's the nitty gritty of that look like?\
\
[00:18:46.330] - Erin\
So, there are ways you can actually just put the email directly into Google Calendar. But for me, most of it is just, like I just throw it a block of time and I'm like, I think this is going to take me 2 hours to do this thing, so I'm going to schedule it in. Or every Wednesday, from one to two. I'm going to just get through these emails. I know there are some really cool ways you can do this, but I just find like, for me and my brain, like whatever is the simplest, like the least path to resistance, I just do. And maybe I'm not using all of the cool automations and stuff that are out there, but it works for me. And if somebody wants more, just know there are really cool things you can do between your Gmail and like Google Calendar integration with your email.\
\
[00:19:32.550] - Liz\
Okay. Yes. If you have the time to dig into that, but don't use it as a prestination method. \
\
[00:19:40.550] - Erin\
Yes. I think that's like one of my big things too. I'm like, I want to know how to do these cool things, and I know about them, but I spend more time than just doing the organization and stuff than actually getting the thing done. So, whatever is your path to getting things done the fastest? Yeah.\
\
[00:19:57.330] - Liz\
I used to set a time limit, though, on how long you're allowed to research and try to figure out another way. I did that yesterday. I was like, okay, this is driving me nuts. This is so tedious. I am okay wasting an afternoon trying to figure this out. And if I don't come up with a better solution, I'm done. I'm just going to keep going. But I'm okay, if I give this a go for several hours once.\
\
[00:20:20.550] - Erin\
Did you get a good solution?\
\
[00:20:22.080] - Liz\
I did figure out, it wasn't email related, but it was somewhat related. I did figure out a bit more streamlined. I figured out the issue of why what I thought was going to work didn't. And so, it was a whole thing regarding making all the workbooks for the summit syllable. It's like, I do not want to have to go in and create a box. And like the tool I thought would automatically recognize it wasn't. And then I figured out if I uploaded it as a lower quality PDF that was flattened, whatever that means, it would recognize it. The whole afternoon of going down a rabbit hole and trying, okay, well, maybe I need to try this other tool instead, because the one I thought would work isn't working, again.\
\
[00:21:01.960] - Liz\
It was just meaningless, the whole thing. But yeah, so I was like, we can waste one afternoon on this because the potential return is a lot of time. And I actually managed, once I figured out later that night, I sat down and I managed to get all the workbooks that I had so far, all the worksheets for each session done. And normally, I would have taken days.\
\
[00:21:22.640] - Erin\
Yeah, that's awesome.\
\
[00:21:24.090] - Liz\
The one afternoon. But I was like, you can't keep going up, like this is your one chance. Otherwise, you're just going to have to sit through the [inaudible 00:21:32] . So, yeah. If you want to kind of explore, that would be my tip, you know, a better way to use things, set a time limit on how much time you're allowed to explore and learn and think through that before you just go back, you know. Yeah.\
\
[00:21:46.200] - Erin\
I love that. I think that's really good because it's really easy to get lost in the procrastination of finding the best way when sometimes it's better to just get things done.\
\
[00:21:57.850] - Liz\
Yes. Yes, so give yourself time limits, give yourself deadlines. These are all things of part of being your own boss and being an entrepreneur. Okay, so I mean I know you have some awesome things for our attendees, but before we get to those, any sort of additional tips or advice you would have in terms of making sure your time in your email is productive.\
\
[00:22:22.190] - Erin\
I would say don't open your email first thing in the morning. So, email is basically a to do list that other people are sending you. It is not necessarily your priority. Your to do list, like, you might have other goals for what you want to get done that day. And as soon as you open that email, you start getting sidetracked. At least I do, and I think a lot of people do. Maybe there are some people who don't, but when I know I've got stuff to respond to, it just throws off. I'm like, let me just get through these emails and then I can work on the thing that I wanted to work on. And then 3 hours later, I'm like, oh man, like I'm tired. I don't want to do the thing that I was supposed to do.\
\
[00:23:00.250] - Liz\
Or I have to go get the kids off the bus and then they're going to fight and I've got a referee and I'm not going to be able to work.\
\
[00:23:06.960] - Erin\
Exactly. So, I would say don't open your email first thing in the morning. And if you can't, I mean, yes, like you're probably depending on your business, like you need to check email daily-ish, but you can also do like an auto responder that says, I try to respond to emails within 48 or 72 hours. So, you kind of set expectations that you're not living in your inbox. Because email is not actually meant to be an instant form of communication. It's not a chat, it's, even though a lot of people use it like one. It's like getting a letter and then there can be a little bit of a delay before you respond, and that's okay. But if you have clients, especially, I know probably a lot of people listening to this are watching this, have more like digital products. But I know when you do client work especially, you have this need of constantly being like available. But no company is constantly available, right? Like as a soloprenuer.\
\
[00:24:07.890] - Erin\
No, no one person.\
\
[00:24:09.710] - Liz\
I think most of your customers know that you're probably, just you or a small team.\
\
[00:24:14.400] - Erin\
Yes.\
\
[00:24:15.650] - Liz\
And you can set that expectation of like, hey, if you're a customer, you know we check emails this often. We try to respond as promptly as possible, but please be patient.\
\
[00:24:25.290] - Erin\
Exactly.\
\
[00:24:27.030] - Liz\
You know like recognize that you're a human being and make sure your customers know it too. \
\
[00:24:30.980] - Erin\
Yes. And it's totally okay to set those boundaries and those expectations, no matter what your business is. So, don't be afraid to have an autoresponder that sets those expectations and not feel guilty about not checking your email first thing or waiting a day to respond to things if you need time to think about it.\
\
[00:24:50.540] - Liz\
Yes. Okay. And I know you have a fantastic, like if you guys want to really dig into this more, you have, I love the name of it, GTFO, your inbox, do you want to tell us a little bit about that?\
\
[00:25:04.000] - Erin\
Yeah, so it's basically my, I forget how many lessons are in it, but it's a mini courses, short. It will only take about half an hour to watch all of the videos. It will of course take longer to actually implement and depending on how much your inbox needs wrangling. It could take, you know, a bit of time, but the idea is that you get all of the steps that you need in a very short period of time, and then you can start implementing them one by one or however many you want to at a time to start taking back control of your inbox. And I go in depth into like how I do my labeling. I talk more about best practices for in your inbox to get you in and out as quickly as possible. I've got, like, some copy and paste stuff, like an autoresponder that you can use and tweak to your business, so that you don't have to come up with it from scratch.\
\
[00:25:54.700] - Liz\
Yes. Yes, and I think if you guys get the all access pass, you'll actually get access to that included as part of the pass that you will need to pay for it. So, if you haven't gotten your all access pass yet, definitely go do that. Erin, thank you so much. Any final words you want to share?\
\
[00:26:09.910] - Erin\
Oh, gosh. First of all, I really appreciate like chatting about this and kind of, like, geeking out about mail organization. Hopefully, everybody who tuned in is now as excited as I get about labeling their inbox. So, basically, yeah, if anybody does follow the steps that we talked about today or goes even more in depth with the course, please let me know how it's working for you. Send me a screenshot of your cleaned out inbox or your neatly labeled inbox. And I really love nothing more than seeing how people organize their stuff. So, really, it would be super fun.\
\
[00:26:46.600] - Liz\
Yes. Yes. I have a feeling that you, like me, also own a label maker for your home.\
\
[00:26:51.920] - Erin\
Of course.\
\
[00:26:54.690] - Liz\
There are those that do and those that don't. That's really the difference. But you don't need a label maker to get a handle on your inbox. You can do that even if you aren't as label, you know, excited as we are. Okay, so thank you. And guys, if you have questions, in the chat, we are available to answer those. Obviously, this is pre recorded, but Erin, thank you so much.\
\
[00:27:17.420] - Erin\
Thank you. \

**Transcript:**\
[00:00:13.730] - Erin\
Hey, and welcome to today's presentation on how to set and achieve your goals. Here's what you're going to learn today. You're going to learn what success actually is and you're going to learn how to set achievable goals. My goal is that you won't leave here today knowing exactly how to set and achieve goals that support your unique vision of success. Now, before we start, please get out a piece of paper and a pen because we are going to work as we go and feel free to screenshot any of these slides.\
\
[00:00:41.570] - Erin\
If I'm moving too fast. I'm going to have a lot of stuff going on here today and I want you to get the most out of this presentation. So, screenshot away if that you know helps you out and get out the paper and pen so that you can jot down notes as we go. Now I'm Erin Flynn, if we haven't met before. And I believe that business can be simple and still successful, I've been running my own business since 2012, so coming up on ten years here, so pretty long time in the online world.\
\
[00:01:10.980] - Erin\
I'm a web designer and an educator. I mostly teach now.\
\
[00:01:14.150] - Erin\
I'm the founder of Successfully Simple, which is a website where you can go and learn how to simplify your business. I'm queen of the two hour work day, sometimes even less actually, very often, even less, now that I have a kid. And if you would like to connect with me outside of this, you can find me at Successfully Simple on Instagram or Erin Three Flynn on Twitter. So, enough about me. Let's get started.\
\
[00:01:40.590] - Erin\
What is success anyway?\
\
[00:01:45.190] - Erin\
All of our lives, we are told by others what success is. Our parents tell us to be successful by getting good grades, going to College and then getting a good job. Society tells us that success looks like a white picket fence and two and a half kids. The online entrepreneur world tells that success looks like six. No way.\
\
[00:02:04.320] - Erin\
Seven figures, a private jet and luxury vacations. On the surface, all of these things are really great, but in reality, they may not be what we want at all. Sorry, mom and dad, but doing well on standardized tests and even going to college doesn't necessarily lead to getting a good job. And even if it does, a regular eight to five isn't for everyone. I know that I'm not the only one who made myself miserable throughout high school and college obsessing over getting A's only to graduate, get a job, and discover that I hated working for someone else.\
\
[00:02:39.730] - Erin\
The whole white picket fence thing is great for some, but not for all of us. Maybe you want a penthouse condo, and instead of human babies, you want fur babies or plant babies or no babies at all. There's nothing wrong with that. And they're ridiculously extravagant lifestyle portrayed by online entrepreneurs. Besides the fact it's mostly just for show and fake to get you to buy whatever expensive program they're selling.\
\
[00:03:03.100] - Erin\
The focus on making money above all else, can lead to severe burnout and never feeling fulfilled. Why? Because there will always be the potential for more. You'll never be doing enough. Now, I do want to make it really clear that if you want any of the standard markers of success, that is 100%.\
\
[00:03:23.860] - Erin\
Okay. I'm pretty close to the white picket fence thing myself. But if the standard doesn't make you happy, then that is not what success is for you, and that's not what you should be chasing. Now, the problem when we don't meet the so called standard of success, whether it's making a certain amount of money or getting married by a certain age or even looking a certain way, we feel as if we have failed and we continue to feel that way unless we define our own unique vision of success.\
\
[00:03:54.670] - Erin\
If you are constantly trying to reach what other people consider success, you will never feel successful. There will always be something that someone thinks you should do better, or instead you have lost before you even started.\
\
[00:04:10.190] - Erin\
Success is what makes you feel happy and fulfilled, and it doesn't matter if it looks impressive to others. It doesn't matter if it makes your parents happy. Success is personal, and it looks different to all of us. When we define success for ourselves, we are able to set aside the standard and create our own path to feeling fulfilled and successful. It no longer matters what internet gurus are telling us how much money we need to make to be happy, because we have discovered our own numbers that support the life we truly want.\
\
[00:04:39.090] - Erin\
It no longer matters that we don't have a traditional eight to five because we're confident in the business that we've created. No one else's standard of success matters because we know what success means to us. By redefining success, we are taking control of our businesses and our lives instead of feeling like we're feeling for not living up to what someone else cares about. We're able to feel fulfilled and happy. Success isn't what others think of you.\
\
[00:05:03.450] - Erin\
It's what you think of yourself. So I want you to take action. What does success mean to you? I've got some questions for you to think about. Question number one, what did your parents tell you about success?\
\
[00:05:18.520] - Erin\
Do you feel as if their vision of success is right for you? Why or why not? Question two, what messages about success is society telling you? Do you feel as if this vision of success is right for you?\
\
[00:05:31.710] - Erin\
Why or why not? Question three, what are online entrepreneurs telling you about success? Do you feel as if their vision of success is right for you? Why or why not?\
\
[00:05:43.250] - Erin\
Having considered what others considered successful summarize what you confidently feel success is and isn't for you. Going to pause here for a second. Feel free to take a screenshot, dot down some notes. And if you feel comfortable, share in the chat, have you figured out what success means to you and if so, what does it look like?\
\
[00:06:01.780] - Erin\
You just give us a little sentence about it. I'm going to pause here real quick. Let you take some time to think about this.\
\
[00:06:17.550] - Erin\
Okay, now let's talk about how to set achievable goals. Now that we know what our own visions of success look like, it's time to create goals that will get us there. It's important to understand that goals are not the same as dreams. A dream is just an idea, something floating around in our imagination that we would love to have. A goal is something achievable because we are going to make a plan to get there.\
\
[00:06:43.830] - Erin\
Now that said, you also have to understand that no one wakes up one day with the goal to going Mount Everest, packs a bag, books a flight and calls that planning. You don't go from zero to dream that easily. Instead, there are months, if not years of preparation, smaller hikes, learning about equipment, testing gear and freezing weather, and lots and lots of body conditioning. Likewise, we can't wake up one day with the idea that we're going to earn $250,000 in the next month without first setting the proper foundations for success.\
\
[00:07:16.950] - Erin\
We're going to talk about smart goals because not all goals are created equal. In fact, some goals are worthless because you can't track them and you never know when you reach them. These vague goals must be avoided at all costs. Instead, we want to establish smart goals, and you've probably heard of these before. They're you know all over the place.\
\
[00:07:38.410] - Erin\
The first reference that I can find goes back to Peter Drucker in 19 55, but this idea has been shared and adapted throughout the years. But this is really important because they are so key to creating achievable goals. Smart is an acronym that stands for Specific Measurable, Achievable, Relevant and Time bound. And we're going to go into each of these. So, specific is the first letter in the acronym and you have to be specific about what it is you're trying to accomplish. If you're not, it's going to be hard, if not impossible, to accomplish your goal.\
\
[00:08:17.110] - Erin\
One of the best ways to be sure your goal is specific is by asking the six Ws. Now you might want to screenshot this one because there's kind of a lot on this slide, but to make sure that your goal is specific, you will ask yourself these questions, who is needed? Is it just you or will others be involved? What do I want to do? What exactly are you trying to accomplish?\
\
[00:08:42.690] - Erin\
Where does it happen now? This may not be necessary for all goals, but if there's a specific location, it needs to be written down. And online, this could even be someplace like Instagram or Facebook or TikTok or wherever. When does it happen. Each goal needs a time limit.\
\
[00:08:59.670] - Erin\
Why is it important? What does this goal mean to you? Why are you doing it? And by the way, because some internet guru told you to do it is not a good reason. Which requirements are involved? Do you need to learn a new skill or hire someone?\
\
[00:09:15.710] - Erin\
Are there legal requirements or any additional resources that are needed going through all of these questions will ensure that each goal you set is really specific.\
\
[00:09:27.070] - Erin\
Alright, the next one is M for measurable. Goals have to be measurable. Otherwise, how will you know when you've reached them? How will you know you're on the right track? When your goals are measurable, they help you stay focused and motivated. To make sure your goal is measurable, you should be able to answer how much or how many as well as how you will know when you've reached it. So, for example, how many clients, how much revenue? Right.\
\
[00:09:55.590] - Erin\
The A is for achievable. Goals should stretch you, but not be impossible. Hiking Mount Everest this coming weekend, for example, is going to be impossible for pretty much everybody. Hiking a ten mile trail when you've previously only done a five mile might be a bit of a stretch, but it's likely achievable. So, when setting your goals, ask yourself, how can you accomplish this goal and how realistic is it based on where you are now? Another example of this might be if you're making $50,000 a year, and you want to make 100,000 or you want to make $500,000, that's a really big jump. But making 100,000 could be your next step on your way to $500,000.\
\
[00:10:34.470] - Erin\
The R is for relevant.\
\
[00:10:38.850] - Erin\
Why does this goal matter to you? Does it take you closer to your vision of success? And if it doesn't? If it doesn't lead you on that path, it is not relevant. But if it does, this is a relevant goal that you are setting towards what your vision of success looks like.\
\
[00:10:55.030] - Erin\
It will help keep you motivated.\
\
[00:10:59.790] - Erin\
So, to determine if your goal is relevant, you can ask yourself these questions. Does this support my vision of success? If not, don't do it. Is this the right time to work on this goal? Sometimes goals are really great, but the timing can be really off.\
\
[00:11:16.860] - Erin\
So, for example, if you have a goal to launch a new service, but you're heading off on a family vacation, it might not be the right time. Maybe you want to wait until you get back. Am I the right person to work on this goal? Some goals are better left to others. Maybe you want a new website design.\
\
[00:11:34.670] - Erin\
That's part of you know your vision of success. But you know nothing about making a website. In that case, it might be better to hire someone else. So, make sure your goals are relevant. Sometimes we set goals based on what we see others doing, but in reality you're relevant to us.\
\
[00:11:52.870] - Erin\
And our visions of success.\
\
[00:11:56.730] - Erin\
Alright, the T is for time bound. Goals needed the time limit, will be hard to stay motivated and get them done. Having a time limit on your goals ensures that they remain a priority and they don't get pushed aside by other things. For example, if you have a goal of getting three new clients by the end of the quarter, that's going to motivate you to do the steps, take the actions that you need to get those clients.\
\
[00:12:22.200] - Erin\
If, on the other hand, you just have three new clients sometime, then you're not going to be very likely to be motivated to achieve that goal and it's going to get pushed to the back. Most of us make goals that are not smart and therefore we don't achieve them. They're just way too vague. Most of us will make a goal at something like get more clients. But that is not a good goal because it's lacking many major components of being smart.\
\
[00:12:53.670] - Erin\
So, why is that a really bad goal? Well, I kind of just mentioned it. Let's go into why. First of all, it's not very specific. More clients could really mean just about anything, any number at any time you know gotten by anyone.\
\
[00:13:08.080] - Erin\
It's also not measurable. What does more mean? Does it mean one? Does it mean twelve? You will not be able to know when this goal is achieved because it's not you know specific enough. Is it achievable?\
\
[00:13:22.410] - Erin\
Not really, because we don't know what more means and we don't know where we're starting from. Now it probably is relevant, at least somewhat. No one wants clients for no reason, but we're lacking a big why on this goal, why do we need more clients? Is it so that we can you know make enough money to go on family vacation? And it's definitely not time bound because no time was set.\
\
[00:13:45.790] - Erin\
More clients could happen today or it could happen 20 years from now. So, how can we make this goal achievable? I find the easiest way to create a smart goal out of a vague goal, is by writing it out in a full sentence. That means a goal to get more clients becomes I want to get three clients in the next 30 days so that I can take two months off this summer. See how that works?\
\
[00:14:15.370] - Erin\
This works because the goal is specific. We say exactly what we want. It's measurable. Three clients will know when we've reached it. It's achievable, but you can't tell here.\
\
[00:14:24.810] - Erin\
This is you know kind of based on past experience. Okay, we could get three clients. That makes sense. Maybe ten doesn't make sense in that time frame, but three seems doable. It's relevant. The why is that.\
\
[00:14:36.720] - Erin\
We can take time off without needing to work, which is supporting our vision of success. And it's time bound. We're going to do it in the next 30 days. It's easy to see how setting goals this way helps us stay motivated and focused on what we're trying to accomplish. If you run all of your goals through the smart filter, you'll be sure to choose good ones because you'll know that they support your success.\
\
[00:15:02.290] - Erin\
So, I want you to take action and start using the smart filter on all of your goals. Run them through. Are they smart? Are they too big? If in doubt, write them out as a question. Now I would love it.\
\
[00:15:15.140] - Erin\
If in the chat, you would share a smart goal with me that you have for your business that supports your vision of success. I'm going to give you a little pause. So, you have time to do that.\
\
[00:15:36.570] - Erin\
Okay, so here's what you learned today. You learned what success actually is and you learned how to set achievable goals. Success is what is important to you. Your unique vision of success, not what is set by other people. You also learned how to set achievable goals by using smart, setting smart goals so that you know when you have actually achieved them.\
\
[00:16:00.270] - Erin\
You now know what your vision of success is and how to set goals that will help you reach it. So, I want you to take action. I would love it if you would tag me on successful simple on Instagram. You can also use the hashtag successfully simple and I might feature you. You can do a story about how you're setting your goals.\
\
[00:16:18.950] - Erin\
You can do a post whatever makes sense for you. I would love to show off how you are setting and reaching your goals. Now, if you like this and you want more, you can learn how to set your annual goals in this free mini training in less than five minutes. You'll know how to set achievable goals for the next year. You'll get a printable worksheet to help keep you on track.\
\
[00:16:39.660] - Erin\
I hate mine, you know post it up. So, I can see what my goals are for the year. You can get this at successfullysimple.com/bigpicture. Alright. Thank you so much. I'm so happy that you tuned in.\

**Transcript:**\
[00:00:13.060] - Faith\
Hey, guys. Welcome to the Potent Action Workshop. My name is Faith Mariah, and I'm going to be talking about how to create more results in one week than you did in the last 30 days without working more hours. All right, I'm really excited. Let's go ahead and jump into this. If we haven't met or become Internet friends yet, I'm faith Mariah.\
\
[00:00:35.980] - Faith\
I'm a business mindset coach. I'm the founder of the Becoming Boss Mastermind. I'm a certified life and weight loss coach. My background is in social work, and then I also have experience making full-time income online for the last seven years.\
\
[00:00:52.660] - Faith\
And I currently generate multiple six figures online, and I help other women that want to do the same. And I am very excited to help you with your business today. So, the first thing I want to talk about when we talk about increasing our results without increasing hours is that not all actions are equal. So, what I see happen a lot is entrepreneurs, especially new entrepreneurs, have this thought error that is, I want more results, therefore I just need to do more things. I just need to do more actions.\
\
[00:01:27.780] - Faith\
This is kind of how we're taught goal setting in our culture, which doesn't work because most people fail their new year's resolutions and aren't able to pursue goals, especially over a long period of time. And if you're going to build a business, that is a long term goal. It's year after year after year, not just one year as a resolution, so it has to go even longer. And so, it requires a much, much higher level of thinking even than doing a new year's resolution for an entire year. It's a much different level of commitment and thinking.\
\
[00:02:00.940] - Faith\
So, most people think, they're like, I want more results, I just need to do more tasks. I just need to do more things. I just need to do more things on my to-do list. And what I see a lot of people do is they're very, very busy. They're doing lots of things, but they're not necessarily creating results.\
\
[00:02:17.520] - Faith\
So, the first thing I want to offer you guys is you want to be, do not get lost in, like, just doing tasks on a to-do list. You want to be focused on what results do I need to create to create customers? Okay. A lot of people look at analytics and they look at the wrong numbers, the most important number when you're an entrepreneur or you're a business owner is always sales.\
\
[00:02:41.800] - Faith\
And so, we really want to be thinking, okay, we're trying to create the results of sales. What are the most potent things I can do? And you really want to figure out what's going to give you the most bang for your buck. You have to put your brain to work and test things, right? So, you're just going to have to take your best guess, come up with a hypothesis, I think these tasks will give me the most bang for my buck and create customers.\
\
[00:03:10.470] - Faith\
I think I'll be able to get the most leverage doing Instagram reels or I think I'll be able to get the most leverage learning Facebook ads. And you just have to take your best guess and go test it, right? So, you're always testing things, evaluating the results, adjusting, testing things, evaluating the results. And that's going to help you move forward so much faster than most people, right? Most of you probably don't have multiple six-figure or seven-figure businesses.\
\
[00:03:37.770] - Faith\
And you want to keep your business as simple as possible. If you're making your business complicated, now, think how complicated it's going to be when there's hundreds of thousands of dollars and lots and lots of clients and lots and lots of stuff going on. It's like we want to start with a very simple foundation, a simple and effective foundation. And so, when you're thinking about creating more results, I don't want you to think about just doing more tasks and doing more stuff. I want to think about getting results.\
\
[00:04:08.320] - Faith\
And what I find is if I can get people to focus less on just doing more stuff, doing more stuff, doing more stuff, and being on that treadmill, I need more time. We're going to talk about that. I don't have enough time. I need more time because I need to do more stuff, right? If I can get you out of that and take you to a place of life, how can you triple the free value you're giving?\
\
[00:04:30.210] - Faith\
How can you really, really take to the next level everything you're doing that's working? So, what is working? And how can you make that even better? How could you make your emails more valuable to people? How can you make your podcast more valuable to people?\
\
[00:04:46.330] - Faith\
How can you make your challenges and your live events and the things that you do before you sell? How can you make those more valuable for people and really upping that nurture piece, right? What's the most effective way for you to get leads right now? Not just like posting on Instagram. A lot of times people are just like, oh, I just post three times a day.\
\
[00:05:04.840] - Faith\
That's not a strategy because it doesn't necessarily create a result, except for you posting on Instagram. But that's not what you guys want. You guys want customers, right? So, it's much more useful for you guys to think about, how can I get three customers this week than focusing on, let me post on Instagram three times a week. Like, the intention is different.\
\
[00:05:25.750] - Faith\
One is just checking tasks off the list. Post on Instagram three times a week. Check, check, check, do, do, do, task, task, task, right? And one is outcome focus.\
\
[00:05:34.870] - Faith\
How can I create three customers this week? And then if you do post on Instagram, it's going to be much more intentional because you're trying to post on Instagram not just to check off your stuff on your to do list because you heard somewhere that you need to post on Instagram three times a week, right? You're going to be focusing on posting with more intention to actually create clients. Okay? Remember that the only outcome you really, really want to focus on is creating sales and clients, don't get lost in the sauce.\
\
[00:06:01.800] - Faith\
A lot of times people get focused on follower numbers or email list size and like, you know, that stuff is important to an extent and those numbers can be helpful. But for most of you, you need to focus on getting sales. If you're not getting sales, like, adding more followers is not going to help you. If you're not getting sales, adding more people to your email is not going to help you. Right?\
\
[00:06:24.270] - Faith\
We need to fix those things and fixing that process, seeing where is your business breaking down? Why are we not making those sales? How can I increase revenue? Putting your brain to work on those things and working on problem solving and creating results is very different than just like, okay, send out my weekly newsletter, check.\
\
[00:06:43.470] - Faith\
Post on Instagram three times a week, check. Record my podcast, check. And like, you could do all those things and be busy working every week and create absolutely no results. So, I wrote on the slide, more action does not equal better results. Adding more action and time is lazy thinking.\
\
[00:06:59.800] - Faith\
So, the most common thing I see is people are like, I want more results, I just don't have enough time. I wish I had more time, I don't have enough time. Right? And the reason they think they need more time is because they think they need to do more things, do more tasks. I just need to be busier.\
\
[00:07:15.790] - Faith\
Being busier does not necessarily make you money. Most of the time, it just makes your business very, very inefficient. Most people, when they get more time, produce at the exact same level they're producing now, they produce very similar results. I have very rarely seen an entrepreneur quit their job or clear up a significant amount of time off their calendar and all of a sudden it start producing results. Maybe they add more tasks and they start doing more actions, but usually they are creating the same amount of sales.\
\
[00:07:46.350] - Faith\
It's kind of like you are selling at the level you're selling at and adding more time doesn't up level you're selling. Adding more time doesn't make your post any better. If they're not getting customers now, like adding more time and doing more of them is not going to help that. And so, we want to focus on the potency in which we are doing things. So, these are some better questions.\
\
[00:08:08.200] - Faith\
How could you cut your hours in half and double your income? I actually did this one year as my new year's resolution. I cut my hours to 20 hours a week. And doubled our income from 100,000 to 200,000. Right?\
\
[00:08:21.790] - Faith\
So, I literally doubled the results I was getting with less time. Because time doesn't create more results. Time and results are not linked. They're not linked. It's like, yeah.\
\
[00:08:32.170] - Faith\
Do you have to have some time to work? Yeah. But adding more time does not necessarily create more results. In fact, what I see most of the time, especially new entrepreneurs, when you guys have more time, you just have more time to be confused. Think about how you don't know what to do.\
\
[00:08:47.190] - Faith\
Think about, I don't know how to do this, should I do this, should I do that, I don't know if it's working? What if it's not working? What if this is a waste of time and you just indulge in more low level thinking? You just waste more time being confused, right?\
\
[00:08:58.620] - Faith\
So, for most of us, like when we have more time, it doesn't create more results. It just creates more time for us to be confused and indulge in how we don't know what to do and indulge in a bunch of lazy, low level thinking. That's what it creates for probably 98% of the people. I've pushed a lot of entrepreneurs, so probably hundreds, hundreds of entrepreneurs. And probably for all of them, when we give them more time to do things, it just allows you to indulge in inefficiencies and be inefficient and be confused and have a lot of low level thinking.\
\
[00:09:29.140] - Faith\
Like giving yourself less time gives you less time to mess around. So, how could you cut your hours in half and double your income? That's a really good place to take your brain because you'll start seeing the leverage points of, like, what actually has to happen to make money. That's where what you need to figure out is, like, what actually has to happen to make money. And you do that with very specific thinking, with testing very specific strategies.\
\
[00:09:58.260] - Faith\
Right? Our brains don't like specificity. They love to dabble. They love to be confused. They don't like to do the deep thinking that we need to do to make this happen.\
\
[00:10:08.940] - Faith\
And this is a very good place to take your brain. It will require you to get very specific about the things that are working and the things that are not. And it will require you, in the time that you do have and the content you are putting out for that to be very, very good. Because you're not just going to be putting out tons of random stuff anymore. How could you create more results this week than you did in the last 30 days?\
\
[00:10:31.200] - Faith\
We do this challenge in my community kind of regularly. We did it twice this year. And people are always very surprised. Look at the results. And by results, I mostly mean sales, right?\
\
[00:10:43.870] - Faith\
Revenue. How can you create more money this week than you did in the last 30 days? That's a very good challenge. And think about if you put your brain to work at that every week, and you thought about that and you worked at that in a year. Think how much more efficient you're going to be at making money.\
\
[00:11:03.070] - Faith\
Right? We do not need more time. This does not have to take a long time. You do not need more time to do more tasks. You need to do less things at a higher level.\
\
[00:11:12.760] - Faith\
And the easiest way to up level your content is just give yourself less time to do things. We have a really common thought error that is, I think I have a slide on this, but we have a really common thought error that is more time. If I spend more time on things, the quality will improve. But like I said, when you have more time, you're usually just indulging in low level thinking, which does not improve the quality of your content. Right.\
\
[00:11:39.250] - Faith\
So, time and quality, not linked. Not linked. Some of my best work has taken me no time at all. Just came right out. Right.\
\
[00:11:47.820] - Faith\
So, I just want you guys to unlink those in your brain. Very not helpful when you're an entrepreneur. And then this is one of my favorite questions. We call this, like, the $20 Challenge or the $20 question. If people were paying $20 a month to be on your email list, would you feel good about the content?\
\
[00:12:02.940] - Faith\
If they were paying $20 a month to read your blog, would you feel good about that content? Right. A lot of us think that our free content doesn't have to be as good. We don't want to give our best stuff away for free. And I just think that's never a good use of your time.\
\
[00:12:19.740] - Faith\
Like, what I think is a better use of your time is growing your reputation as someone who creates a lot of valuable content. Right. I think I believe a lot in networking and growing your business through networking. And you're not going to network well if your emails and your blogs are not valuable, if your podcast isn't valuable, like, that stuff isn't doing much for your business. But if you're providing a ton of value, I'm like, I want my free stuff to be better than most people's paid stuff.\
\
[00:12:46.810] - Faith\
I want our free trainings to be better than most of the courses people buy. That's how good I want my paid stuff, right? And then take your brain to a place of, like, what if they were paying $100 a month? Would you be proud of the emails you're sending? What if they were paying $1,000 and then put your brain to work of like, what would have to be in my emails to be able to charge $1,000 a month?\
\
[00:13:07.260] - Faith\
Like it's just a good place to take your brain. It allows you to create more results for your people and create more customers without just doing more tasks and doing more tasks and doing more stuff. Okay, this is one of my favorite. Like, I can really go on a rant about this, but I'm going to try and be brief so I can get through these slides for you guys. You decide how long things take.\
\
[00:13:29.260] - Faith\
So, something I see in here a lot is people in their business talk about tasks as if they don't have any input about how long they take, right? And this is just another thought error, and it's just not true. Like, you decide how long your tasks take. Like I was coaching someone the other day, and she's like, well, it takes me 90 minutes to write an email. And I was like, stop doing that.\
\
[00:13:53.210] - Faith\
I was like, don't get yourself, I was like, 90 minutes to do what. Right? So, I was like, I would try to write your email in 20 minutes, right. Decide to develop the skill of writing an email in 20 minutes. And I was telling her, I was like, think about over the lifetime of your business, how much more you will get done year after year after year if you learn how to write an email in 20 minutes versus just letting it take 90 minutes every time you do it. And things really expand to take the amount of time that you give yourself.\
\
[00:14:25.030] - Faith\
And a lot of entrepreneurs don't decide ahead of time how long tasks take, and then they take probably about four times as long, right, as they usually do. And so, one of the things we do when we talk about, like, increasing, like, getting more results is like, first of all, focus on that potency, not the volume, because that's the most important thing. But second of all, like, I do think it is important to give yourself less time to do things and learn to become someone who controls their time, right? When you're just like, I don't know how long it's going to take, I don't know how long it's going to take to write the email.\
\
[00:14:57.340] - Faith\
I don't know how long it's going to take to record a module. I've never done it before. I don't know. It's like, you're just going to end up letting that path take. I mean, who knows how long?\
\
[00:15:05.890] - Faith\
Like, a really, really, really long time. This is how it ends up taking people months and months and months and months to do their course, or months and months and months to make their sales page, or whatever it is that they're putting off because they just don't give themselves any deadlines. So, everything you do when you sit down to work, you want to know what result you're creating in that time and how long you're going to take. And you decide that ahead of time with the highest part of your brain, you decide, how long am I going to spend writing this email ahead of time.\
\
[00:15:33.430] - Faith\
You don't just let the course take however long or the emails take however long. Like, you have control over this, the amount of time you spend on tasks and how long things take is 100% within your control. That's a much more useful thought, right? Then just like, I just have to see how long it takes. And people push back on me on this sometimes.\
\
[00:15:50.670] - Faith\
And I always use this example of like, how long does it take to write a term paper? Like, if you go to grad school, like, I did a thesis, right? If I go to grad school and I don't just tell the teacher, well, I've never wrote a thesis before, I don't know how long it's going to take. I'm just going to have to see. I'll just have to see how long it takes.\
\
[00:16:06.940] - Faith\
It's like, no, they have like, deadlines. It's like, you have to have it done by this date, right? And so, instead of them telling you the deadline, you do that for yourself. You decide how long you have to do things and how long things are going to take, right, and you get it done. And thesis are huge.\
\
[00:16:23.610] - Faith\
It's a pain in the butt, right? But you can still get it done in that timeframe because we do have control over how long things take, right? And then this is, I just love this, I know I already said it, but I have to say it again. More time does not equal better quality work, right?\
\
[00:16:39.730] - Faith\
So, a lot of times when I start talking about this stuff, people are like, well, that's fine, faith, but I really want my stuff to be really good, and I only want to put out the best stuff. And I'm like, more time doesn't equal better quality. Right? I think quantity creates quality, right? Like I always say, like, I'm good at coaching or I'm good at teaching this stuff because I've done it for hundreds and hundreds of hours, right?\
\
[00:17:02.710] - Faith\
Literally. Literally, we just uploaded all of my replays into a portal for a program, and it's hundreds of ours. I think that makes me better at what I do. And it will be the same for posting on social media or writing emails.\
\
[00:17:14.230] - Faith\
It's like the more you send them, the more you do it, the better you will get at it. And so, quantity can create quality. Usually, the people that are thinking like, oh, I want to create quality, they have this thought that's like, oh, I want my stuff to be very good. I only want to put all my best stuff right? And what that creates for them is a bunch of pressure and stress and overwhelm.\
\
[00:17:38.200] - Faith\
And those feelings do not create your best work. I would say, like, genius ideas don't live in stress and overwhelm. That's not when your best stuff is going to come to you, right? And so, all you're doing when you're thinking the thought, I want to put out my best stuff is usually just making yourself very slow. It doesn't make your quality of work better.\
\
[00:17:59.290] - Faith\
It just makes you slow. Okay, so give yourself less time. You don't necessarily even have to do more tasks. I would rather cut your time in half and just work half as much, right and create the same amount of results that you did last month. Like, would you cut your hours, and how potent would your work have to be, and efficient.\
\
[00:18:19.090] - Faith\
So, when I'm talking about potency, I'm not talking about, like, spending hours and hours and hours on email to write the best email of all time, because I don't think time and quality are linked, okay? So, when we're talking about increasing potency, it's not like, oh, spend a really long time on it. Like time and quality are not linked. Okay, I'm going to go through these facts.\
\
[00:18:38.080] - Faith\
These are just low level thoughts people have about time. I don't have enough time. I'm really busy. I have a lot to do. I don't need to do it now, I can do it later.\
\
[00:18:46.530] - Faith\
My brain loves that one. My brain is like, we're very tired. We can do it later. I'm not doing enough. I think women, in general, most women have this thought in the loop in the back of their mind, which is like, I should be doing more, I should be doing more, I should be doing more.\
\
[00:19:00.070] - Faith\
I'm not doing enough. And I actually think that's what creates burnout. Not the amount of hours that you work, it's the amount of hours that you work and the time that you spent thinking that you should be doing more. And it's not enough. I've been working really hard.\
\
[00:19:14.290] - Faith\
And that's another one. I've been working really hard. It's like, what does that mean? Creates the result of you not working that hard. So, I just want to show you this very quickly.\
\
[00:19:24.900] - Faith\
I know I said it, but I think it's helpful to see it written down. So, the fact is there's 24 hours in a day. That's a fact. We could take it to a court of law. Okay?\
\
[00:19:34.990] - Faith\
And then a lot of times I see people's thought about there being 24 hours in a day. They think, I don't have enough time. And then that thought creates overwhelm, which makes them actually work less efficiently and spend more time being confused and debating what to do first and putting off making decisions and complaining to family about how busy they are, right? And not making progress on their business. And the result of those actions is that they create less time for themselves.\
\
[00:20:06.640] - Faith\
Right? So, you want to look at, like, what am I thinking about time? How does that make me feel when I'm thinking and feeling those things? What am I doing and what result am I creating? And the thought, I don't have enough time almost never creates anything useful.\
\
[00:20:23.350] - Faith\
I coached a lot of people. I just don't see it being useful for anybody, really. So, let's just, I'm going to just kind of summarize, getting more done, right? And when I'm talking about getting more done, it's not just like doing more stuff. It's like creating more results, right?\
\
[00:20:38.940] - Faith\
Being more intentional with the things that we are creating. And I think like, to increase intention and increase potency takes less time, not more time. I think creating great results for yourself takes less time, not more time. Okay? Give yourself less time to do things and become someone who does things fast.\
\
[00:20:59.050] - Faith\
Think about how different your business will be in five years if you spend the next five years focusing on doing tasks in less time, giving yourself less time to do things, not indulging in, should I do it this way? Should I do that way? Should I do this way? Should I do that way?\
\
[00:21:13.500] - Faith\
Should I write about this? Should I write about that? It's like being someone who is decisive and sits down and does it and knocks it out and doesn't indulge in any of that stuff and works efficiently. Like, think how much further your business is going to be in a year, five years, ten years.\
\
[00:21:26.520] - Faith\
I'm always like, as a business owner, you got to look far out, right? A lot of new entrepreneurs are like looking down like right in front of them. It's like you need to look up. Businesses are long game, long term.\
\
[00:21:37.080] - Faith\
Ten years. Look up. And think about how much time you're going to spend if you become someone who is fast and set time boundaries for yourself. Do not give yourself unlimited amounts of time to make modules or make courses or make products or write blog posts. Like, give yourself very, very challenging deadlines. Like really challenge yourself to become someone who is fast.\
\
[00:22:02.970] - Faith\
Right? And like, I'm saying, I think that will result in your higher quality work to do. I think you'll indulge in less low level thinking and you'll output more and you'll be able to help so many more people and you will just get better just by sheer quantity, right? It's like if you make a thousands TikToks, you're going to be a lot better than someone who spent a lot of time thinking about TikToks and posted five of them. I guarantee it.\
\
[00:22:28.360] - Faith\
Okay. Focus on what is working and what you did get done. A lot of people spend a lot of time thinking, I'm not doing enough, I should be doing more. Spend time focusing on like what you are doing and what you did get done. When we're focusing all of our energy on thinking about I'm not doing enough, I'm not doing enough, I'm not doing enough, we create a just loose loop that we create for ourselves where it's just like there's no winning, right?\
\
[00:22:58.020] - Faith\
And the thing with that thought is a lot of people have that thought and it has nothing to do with how much they're doing. I should be doing more. I should be doing more. I canva get enough time to be working the business more. Right?\
\
[00:23:08.080] - Faith\
A lot of women will make the decision, I want to spend the day with my kid. I just coached someone on this. She took the day to spend with her kid because her kid was sick, and then she came to coaching, and it was telling me how she didn't get enough done on our business. And I'm like, you didn't not get enough done on your business. You made a decision to spend time with your kid.\
\
[00:23:23.680] - Faith\
Like have your own back about that, right? But if you make a decision to spend time with your kid and then you're telling yourself, I need to be working on the business more, that's a loose loose loop that you're putting yourself in where there's nowhere for you to win, right? It's just like you're just doing it wrong all the time. And guess what? It's not sustainable when we're talking about doing a business long term, ten years out.\
\
[00:23:45.820] - Faith\
Like, if you feel like you're losing all the time and you can't win and you're putting yourself in positions where you can't win and you don't have your own back about the decisions you're making, you will burn out, and you will give up, and you will quit, and you will make no money. I'm like, laughing. But it's like, I really think that's true. Just follow your calendar. This is like a mantra in my mastermind and in my community. This is thought has made me a lot of money.\
\
[00:24:08.890] - Faith\
It's like, I'm just going to follow my calendar. I'm just going to follow my calendar. I put all of the tasks I need to do on my calendar, and then I just follow. I'm always like, Google calendar's the boss of me. Google calendar's the boss of me.\
\
[00:24:20.790] - Faith\
I just follow my calendar, and it opts me out of so much drama, and it saves so much energy, because I never come in this office and have to think, what should I do? What should I work on? Should I do that? Should I be doing that? Should I do this thing or that?\
\
[00:24:32.890] - Faith\
It's like, I know exactly what results I need to create, and I spend no time doing low level tasks. A lot of times when we don't have a plan and we sit down in the office, you guys end up on, like, Pinterest, or we end up on Facebook, and we don't end up doing the difficult challenging things that we know we need to do to move the business forward, right? So, spend less time dabbling around and more time doing those tedious, difficult tasks that are going to move your business forward. You know like how many people on here know you need to have a product, but you haven't made it yet? Like, don't go on Facebook till you make that product.\
\
[00:25:07.010] - Faith\
Don't do it. Get it done. And if you've made a product, you get what I'm saying? It's whatever you've been putting off, just go do that thing. Put it.\
\
[00:25:16.650] - Faith\
On your calendar. Break it up into small chunks. The other thing I see people do is they put way too big of projects on their calendar. So, it'll be like, create course on their calendar. That's just too big for your brain.\
\
[00:25:29.260] - Faith\
It needs to be like, create slides for module one, and then it needs to be like record module one, and then it's like upload module one. It's like all of your tasks broken out on your calendar. Because if you put work on course, it's like, what does that mean? I don't know if I got that done. I don't know.\
\
[00:25:45.420] - Faith\
Did I get a lot done? Did I get a little done? Did I get the task done? I don't know. Because it's like, what does that mean, work on course?\
\
[00:25:50.710] - Faith\
I don't know. Well, I guess I worked on it. I don't know what I was trying to accomplish. I don't know what result I was creating. I was just doing tasks.\
\
[00:25:57.880] - Faith\
I wasn't creating a result. So, break things up into little things. Plan ahead of time to not want to follow your calendar. You're not going to want to follow your calendar. You're not.\
\
[00:26:08.800] - Faith\
When you come time to sit down, your brain is going to be like, we're very tired. My brain always does that. It's like, I'm very tired. We've been working very hard. We're very tired.\
\
[00:26:18.690] - Faith\
It's going to offer you that stuff. And it's not a problem. That's just what human brains do because human brains are designed to conserve energy for survival. The survival thing in your brain, it's not because you're lazy and you suck. Like, contrary to popular belief, it's not because of that.\
\
[00:26:35.460] - Faith\
It's just a survival mechanism in your brain. So, you want to know, oh, I have a human brain. It has this survival mechanism in it. I'm going to sit down to do the calendar, and my brain is going to tell me thoughts about how I don't want to do it. And that is not a problem as long as you understand that and you plan ahead of time to not want to do it and you plan ahead of time to do it anyway.\
\
[00:26:56.960] - Faith\
Let's see, you do things you don't want to do every day, right? So, you don't have to want to follow your calendar because you do things you, I mean, you probably don't want to feed your kids all the time either. You probably don't want to pick your kids up from school all the time, but you do those things. We do things we don't want to do every day. So, you're not wanting to follow your calendar is not a problem unless you're managing your mind poorly and letting your brain offer you that thought, I don't want to do this, and then being like, yeah, let's go watch Netflix.\
\
[00:27:25.690] - Faith\
Start small and consistent. If you've not been following a calendar, do not try to follow like, a 40 hours a week calendar. Try to do, like, one thing, okay? One thing every week. Like, okay, Monday at 10:00 a.m., every week, I'm going to start writing emails.\
\
[00:27:39.030] - Faith\
Just do that. Use thoughts that create sustainability in your business. So, I always say the energy in which you do things matters. Okay? And we talk about action fuel.\
\
[00:27:51.240] - Faith\
Like, what energy are you fueling your actions with? What is your action fuel? And your action fuel is your thought feeling combo. So, it's what you're thinking and it's how you're feeling while you're taking the action. Okay?\
\
[00:28:07.090] - Faith\
So, a lot of people, when they start, will use stress or overwhelm to drive them to take action. And that might work for some of you for a little bit. It's like, we can really activate our nervous systems and get ourselves to go do a bunch of work. It is not sustainable. You will burn out.\
\
[00:28:25.060] - Faith\
That is what creates burnout. That is what creates overwhelm. If you're feeling stressed out or overwhelmed, just know it has nothing to do with your to do list. We always say, like, your to do list is neutral. You don't have a lot of things to do or a few things to do.\
\
[00:28:38.820] - Faith\
You just have things to do and then your thoughts about them. That's it. To do list is neutral. You don't have too much to do until you have the thought, I have too much to do. I promise.\
\
[00:28:47.820] - Faith\
I know a lot of you are like, you don't know my life. You don't know about me, though. I do the same thing to my coach. I'm like, you don't know my pain. Right?\
\
[00:29:01.090] - Faith\
So, you want to use thoughts and feelings that create sustainability. Thoughts and feelings that create overwhelm. I don't have enough time to do this. This isn't going to work. I don't know if this is going to work.\
\
[00:29:10.380] - Faith\
Like, that stuff is not sustainable. You've got to find a sustainable thought that will help you take action. What are mine, I'll tell you right now because my brain is always offering me like, no one's going to like this. Anytime I'm making new stuff, it's like, no one's going to like this.\
\
[00:29:24.900] - Faith\
This isn't even that good, right? A lot of us have those thoughts. It's totally normal to have those thoughts. It's the human brain thing, right? And I'll just go to a place that's like, even if no one likes this, I still want to try to help someone.\
\
[00:29:38.890] - Faith\
Even though I don't know if the business is going to grow or not, I still want to see what happens. Like, find somewhere neutral to take yourself. Anytime you feel yourself starting to get stressed or overwhelmed, it's like, stop. Like find a grounding thought, change your action fuel, right?\
\
[00:29:56.910] - Faith\
If you're feeling stressed and overwhelmed, it's because you're fueling your actions with crappy fuel, right? Crappy thoughts and crappy feelings. So, take a better thought and a better feeling and then take the action. All right? That's it for me.\
\

\
**Transcript:**\
Faith Mariah [00:00:12]:\
Hey, guys. Hello. I'm so excited you guys are here. Welcome to the Lazy Bloggers system for achieving success, biz planning to get more results without working more hours. Are you guys excited? I'm excited. I'm gonna walk you guys through my 90 day planning process that I use to manage my multiple six figure business and that I have walked hundreds of people through in my mastermind. So we're gonna do that today. I hope you guys are ready.\
\
Faith Mariah [00:00:36]:\
This is a action taking workshop, so this is not hypothetical. We're gonna create your plan right now so get ready, get your pen out, and let's do this. So if we have not met out on these internet streets yet, my name is Faith Mariah. I help stuck online business owners enter their massive action taking era. My team and I run multiple communities where we do challenges, we do trainings, we do, giveaways, we do all kinds of things to help people get out of the should I do this, should I do that, should I do this, should I do that, and to the actual execution. And we really have a lot of tools to help people get more done in less time. That's what I'm all about, if you can't tell from this workshop. I have a social worker background.\
\
Faith Mariah [00:01:17]:\
I worked as a social worker for a decade. I used to work with, at risk youth doing wilderness counseling, and I used to work in domestic violence. I built an organic email list with 40,000 subscribers and matched my salary at the University of Florida with my mental health job before I ever became a business coach, so I've been at this a minute. I've done over $700,000 in sales, almost all low ticket. I've coached 100's of people inside the Becoming Boss Mastermind, which is one of my action taking communities we offer. And then I doubled our revenue and cut my hours in half. So there was a year where I set the goal to go from working 40 hours to 20 hours, and I went from a 100,000 to 200,000 using a lot of the things I'm gonna share with you guys today. So I know this stuff works and I'm really excited to share it with you.\
\
Faith Mariah [00:02:04]:\
I did bring some gifts for you so if you guys go to www. Faithmariah.com/map you can get a notion board that has all of the links for all of these things. So I have a map you can fill out I'm going to walk you through the map in this workshop but there's an actual map you can actually fill out if you go to this link. And then for bonuses, I brought you guys a 1 page plan. So this is actually a printable document that you can print out and stick on your wall, stick in front of your face. I don't know about you guys, but I'll make plans all the time and forget all about them. Right? And then we get to the end of the year, and we're like, what was my New Year's resolution? I don't know. We don't want that happening here.\
\
Faith Mariah [00:02:44]:\
So I got you guys a 1 page plan. I'm gonna give you the complete notes from the long version of this workshop. You guys are getting, like, the the condensed version. The one I originally taught for this workshop was actually over 2 hours long. Obviously, we cannot do that here at this summit, so I'm gonna give you guys a 30 minute version, and I'm gonna give you guys the complete notes from the long version of this workshop at faithmoriah.com/map. It's inside that Notion dashboard. And then I'm gonna be giving you the bonus how to organize your tasks so you can get them done. This is a simple 20 minute training where you can set all your stuff up.\
\
Faith Mariah [00:03:18]:\
It's gonna save you a ton of time. And then I'm also just gonna give you guys a coupon code because we I want to, like, and why not? So we will give you guys a coupon code for faithmariashop.com. That's my shop where you can get workshops and templates. We have all kinds of stuff in there. I'll hook you guys up with, like, a pretty substantial discount. I don't know what it's gonna be yet because I haven't made it at the time of recording this, but it'll probably be a pretty, pretty, pretty big discount because I love Liz, and I'm excited to be here. And I just wanna hook you guys up because why not? I have a soft spot in my heart from for bloggers. Right? Because I started as a blogger, so, you know, I wanna help you guys out if I can to get the coupon code, to get the 1 page map, to get the notes from the long workshop.\
\
Faith Mariah [00:04:01]:\
Go to faithmoray.com/map, and that will all be there for you guys. So the main thing I want you guys to take away from this workshop is we want to create a plan so that we can minimize time thinking about what to do so we can spend all our time and energy executing. Right? So I see a lot of people that waste a lot of time being like, should I do this? Should I do that? I could do Pinterest. I could do Instagram. Should I do this? Should I do that? We call these energy leaks in my community. Energy leaks tend to happen when you are indecisive. So when you're decisive and you're like, I'm gonna do Pinterest. I'm gonna test for 90 days, you get all that energy back.\
\
Faith Mariah [00:04:39]:\
All of the time you spent thinking, all of the energy you felt you spent thinking, all of those emotions that came up when you're like, should I do instead of Instagram? Should I do Pinterest? Should I do Instagram? So and so is doing Instagram. Maybe I should do Instagram. I don't know if Pinterest is working. We're gonna get you we're gonna close that energy leak, and you're gonna get all of that energy back. You're gonna stay razor focused. We're, like, gonna make a plan, and you're gonna put your blinders on so you can spend no time thinking about what to do and all your time executing, right? When I cut my hours from 40 hours to 20 hours and I doubled our revenue this requires a very high level of focus, right? So it's lazy in the sense like you get a lot of energy back, and I think it's actually easier to work this way, but it requires a higher level of thinking and a higher level of focus. Right? So when I was working 40 hours a week, I didn't have to be as strategic. I didn't have to be as focused.\
\
Faith Mariah [00:05:28]:\
I didn't have to be as productive. Right? And so I actually love the exercise of, can you guys cut your hours in half and keep your input at the same level? I love that exercise because it makes you start to think, where can I plug these energy leaks? Where am I wasting time? How can I be more efficient? And all those different things. So I know a lot of you guys are thinking that sounds nice but how the heck do I do it? I got you. Don't worry, we're gonna go through the whole thing. So this is the number one thing that I see people that are stuck really, really struggle with. Right? So I spend a lot of time thinking about the people in my community and our students and what's the difference between the people that come in and just are staying stuck and just cannot seem to get momentum and the people that come in and they just blow it out of the water and just really grow their businesses really quickly, what's the difference? And the difference I see, one of the main differences is they the people that are productive become very good decision makers. So a lot of people will spend a lot of time thinking about the decision should I do this, should I do that, I could do this, I could do that, and they think about what they want to do and they think about the strategy. All of that time and energy is time and energy you could spend doing, right? It's not actually doing anything for your business.\
\
Faith Mariah [00:06:43]:\
So if I'm spending weeks thinking about should I do Instagram or Pinterest, for example, should I do this niche or that niche, for example, whatever it is for you, instead of spending all that time thinking about that, instead of spending all that time and energy thinking about that, I could just pick 1 and then I could spend all that time and energy thinking about, well, how can I make my graphics awesome in Pinterest? How can I make my blog post more helpful? What is the best kind of content I can make? These are things that actually grow your business forward. Right? Spending time debating trying to do things the right way, spending time debating, to do it the best possible. Right? This is such a good feeling thought for a lot of us, and it sounds so good where it's like, Faith, I wanna make sure I don't waste time and I do everything the right way. Right? Who has that thought? Where are my perfectionists at? I know y'all are out there. Right? It's like, Faith, I I wanna make sure that I do things the right way. I gotta make sure that I'm very thoughtful and I do things in the right way because Because if I make a mistake, that's wasting time, and I don't wanna waste time. Right? But the problem with that thought, if you play that out, like, I wanna make sure I do it the right way. When we think I wanna make sure I do it the right way, that creates a lot of pressure, and pressure usually creates less action, not more action.\
\
Faith Mariah [00:07:53]:\
So something I want you guys to tune into is how do I double my output? Right? I wanna output more than I output last week. I wanna output more today than I did yesterday. I wanna output more this month than I did last month, more this year than I did last year. And if I wanna increase my output, having thoughts like I wanna make sure I do everything right is gonna keep you from that goal. Right? It's gonna make you very, very slow. And I always say business loves speed. Right? So can you become a fast decision maker? When I say a good decision maker in entrepreneurship, I just mean fast decisions. Okay? The other thing that we wanna do to become a good decision maker is you don't remake decisions.\
\
Faith Mariah [00:08:32]:\
Everybody say it with me. We make decisions one time. We do not remake decisions. Okay? So we're gonna make a bunch of decisions in this workshop today. I hope you guys are ready. One of the biggest thought errors I see people have is that if I spend more time thinking about a decision, if I spend more time reading articles about a decision, that means that I'll have a better shot of making a better decision. And I just really wanna challenge that whole idea because there's a lot of factors in business and life that we don't know. There's a lot of unknown.\
\
Faith Mariah [00:09:04]:\
Right? Somebody asked me the other day, they're like, what's the best platform right now? And they had spent weeks researching all these platforms and they're like, I'm really trying to figure out the best one. And I was like, well, it doesn't really matter because a year from now, all of it's going to be different anyway because of AI and everything is changing. But everything in all these industries is changing, right? So you could spend weeks finding the best platform, and it's Right? So you could spend weeks finding the best platform, and it could be sold next year and everything could change. It could, get banned. Right? We've seen the TikTok ban stuff. Like, you don't know what's gonna happen. There's all these unknown variables. So you spending a lot of time researching, you spending a lot of time thinking about it.\
\
Faith Mariah [00:09:38]:\
Unfortunately, we're not fortune tellers. Right? I always tell my community. I'm like, if y'all are fortune tellers, just go play the lotto. It's a lot easier than growing a business. But if we're not fortune tellers, we don't know what's gonna happen in the future. So spending time in the present thinking, thinking, thinking, there's so many unknown variables that you don't know, and spending more time thinking about a decision doesn't mean the decision is better. It just means you are slow, and business loves speed. Okay? It's gonna eliminate shiny object chasing.\
\
Faith Mariah [00:10:05]:\
So when you make a decision and you make a decision once, right, so we're gonna do this in this workshop. Maybe I decide my strategy is gonna be Pinterest, and that's what I'm gonna do when I see old Instagram Jessica business coach up there saying how she makes a bajillion dollars every 2 minutes over on TikTok, I'm not really tempted by that because I already made my decision to try this platform. We make 90 day decisions in my community, so you're gonna make a 90 day plan in this workshop. So you're gonna test it for 90 days. You're just gonna pin if your if your decision is Pinterest, we're gonna pin for 90 days. And then at the end of 90 days, you look at the data. Okay? And then you, based on the data, change your plan. What I see a lot of people do that stay very, very stuck is they change their plan all the time to feel better.\
\
Faith Mariah [00:10:51]:\
This looks like this looks like this. Okay? It's like I'm I'm working on my stuff. I make my plan. I'm doing Pinterest. I'm writing my blog post. I feel good. I'm like, oh, I love my plan. Like, Faith Mariah is awesome.\
\
Faith Mariah [00:11:02]:\
I'm sure all of you are gonna think that. Right? They're like, I've got my plan. I'm so excited. This is gonna work. This is gonna be great. And then you do it for, like, a week, 2 weeks, 3 weeks, 4 weeks, and maybe you're not getting any results, and then the thoughts start changing, right? So it starts being like, I don't know if it's working. I don't know if it's ever going to work. If it's not working out, it might not ever work, right? And so your belief goes down and then when your belief goes down, that feels bad to a lot of us.\
\
Faith Mariah [00:11:29]:\
And so then what a lot of people will do is they'll change their strategy to build their belief back up. So they'll be like, I'm gonna go on TikTok. Right? And they'll be like, oh my gosh. This is gonna work. It's working for so and so. This is gonna be great. This is amazing. And their belief goes back up, but it feels really good.\
\
Faith Mariah [00:11:42]:\
Who's done this? Right? I call this, like, strategy hopping. So it's so shiny object syndrome, like, whatever you wanna call it. Right? It's like belief goes down. I'm gonna try a new strategy. You guys are not, chasing shiny objects and strategy grabbing when you think what you're doing is gonna work. It's always when your belief is low. And guess what? When your belief is low is the worst time to make decisions for your business. Right? Don't make strategic decisions from a place of, oh my god.\
\
Faith Mariah [00:12:08]:\
I don't think this is working. What if this doesn't happen? I've wasted all this time. I've wasted all this money. Don't make strategic business decisions from that place. Okay? Those are emotional decisions. They're not based on data. So we're gonna collect data for 90 days, and and then we're gonna look at the stats on Pinterest. We're gonna look at what's happening on the website, and then we're gonna make a decision about, do I want to keep testing this strategy for 90 more days, or do I wanna try something else? And that's a strategy based decision.\
\
Faith Mariah [00:12:34]:\
Right? Because now we're looking at data. We're looking at numbers. We have some things to base our decision on. Yeah. You're still gonna have to guess at a lot of things in business. Right? Even the data is not always gonna paint a clear picture for you, But it's a lot better to look at data and make an intellectual's decision about your business strategy than, like, get all scared and freaked out and then pivot and do something weird. Right? Who's done this? I've seen people do this with niches, right, where my niche hoppers out. It's like, oh my god.\
\
Faith Mariah [00:13:00]:\
I'm gonna do financing. Oh my god. I'm gonna do this. I don't think it's working. I don't think it's working. Oh my god. I'm gonna do this other one. Right? We I see this with, strategies, right, with platforms, all these different things.\
\
Faith Mariah [00:13:10]:\
So I love the 90 day planning because it speeds you up at execution and slows you down at doing weird stuff, slows you down at shiny object taking, slows you down at, like, all those weird little pivots. We're just gonna delete all of those. Right? So if we create the 90 day plan and you commit to following it for 90 days, we're deleting indecision. You're not gonna have to think about what to do. You're just gonna sit down. You're gonna know exactly what task you need to do. Think about how much energy you would get back if if you knew every time you sit down exactly what you had to do and you didn't have to sit there thinking, should I do this? Should I do that? I could do this. I could do that.\
\
Faith Mariah [00:13:43]:\
I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. We're gonna delete all of that. Right? We're gonna delete, all of the, like, should I try a different strategy? Maybe I should do this. We're gonna delete all of that. We're gonna get all of that energy back to put into our business on things that actually move it forward. Right.\
\
Faith Mariah [00:13:56]:\
All of that stuff, like I said, is just energy leaks. So here we go. We're going to create your plan right now. Everybody put your decision making hat on, okay? And I want everybody to think about making a decision and making it fast is a lot better than being slow. And and I wanna become a fast decision maker. Right? When I see all the entrepreneurs I know that make a lot of money, they're pretty fast decision makers. They test a lot of things. They are willing to fail.\
\
Faith Mariah [00:14:26]:\
They're willing to be a beginner. Right? So a lot of the stuff when we're changing strategies too is, like, we feel cringey or embarrassed and, like, we wanna do really good. You guys should not try to do good. If you're just starting, be bad at it. Be a beginner. Just tell your brain, like, look, I'm gonna be bad at it. I'm gonna test it for 90 days. I'm gonna make a bunch of decisions, and I'm gonna see what happens.\
\
Faith Mariah [00:14:44]:\
You guys with me? So here we go. We're gonna make your business plan right now. I'm gonna walk you guys through 2 main things. Okay. We're gonna fill out your strategy map, and we're gonna create your execution plan. So we're gonna start with your strategy map. Here we go. So here's your strategy map.\
\
Faith Mariah [00:15:00]:\
Yes, I was very pleased with myself with my graphics, where my graphic design challenge people at. Okay, when I make something cute, I'm very excited excited because I don't feel like I'm very good at graphics, but I thought this was freaking adorable. So this is your guys' strategy map. I'm gonna take you through it. We're gonna make decisions and nail all this down right now. You're gonna figure out how are people gonna find you. I'm always like, people cannot pay you if they don't know you exist. Right? We gotta get your offer in front of people that might wanna buy it.\
\
Faith Mariah [00:15:26]:\
How are we gonna do that? Once they find you, right, and by find you, I really mean I want them on your email list. Okay? So by find you, it's like they know you exist. They sign up for your email list. Once they're on your email list, we wanna get them free results. Right? I always say, like, you should not expect people to just take your word that you can help them. You should not expect people to just trust you just because. Like, you have to earn people's trust now more than ever online. And the best way to earn people's trust is, like, I don't expect you guys to just believe I can help you grow your business, right, because I say I can.\
\
Faith Mariah [00:15:59]:\
I'm like, I'm gonna do it in front of your face. Like, come to my workshop. Come to my free training. Come to my free events. Me and my team are gonna get you results for real. And, like, you don't have to take my word for it. I'm gonna do it right in front of your face. Right? So you can do this.\
\
Faith Mariah [00:16:12]:\
There's a lot of different ways you can do this. I'm getting ahead of myself. I'm gonna take you through all the ways. And then the final destination is buyer island. Okay? And we want we want these people to eventually become buyers. So people are finding you. You're nurturing them. Some of them are gonna buy.\
\
Faith Mariah [00:16:27]:\
Okay? That's the process, and I'm gonna take you through exactly what that looks like in each step. And you're gonna leave this workshop with a clear plan for each of these. Your strategy map done, right? Again, I have this in the Notion dashboard for you guys that I made. So if you want the Notion dashboard, it's faithmariah.com/map. We're going to decide right now. We got decision making on your head. Okay, Strategy map. Here we go.\
\
Faith Mariah [00:16:52]:\
We want to decide, pick at least 1. For those of you that are new, just pick 1. I always say this is like juggling, like strategy is kind of like juggling, right? So once you get one of these to work, maybe I'm gonna learn, Instagram reels this quarter, right, or Instagram threads. Let's say I'm gonna do Instagram threads, and I'm gonna go all in on learning everything I can about it, becoming really great at it, kind of finding my footing over there. Once I have that, then I can add in another little juggling ball. Right? So maybe then I'm gonna add in reels or I'm gonna add in LinkedIn. Right? And you can add as you go. But if you don't have any of these working, you just need to pick 1 and, like, obsess over it.\
\
Faith Mariah [00:17:33]:\
What I'll see a lot of people do is they start reusing content and dabbling all around, and they don't actually go deep enough on any platform. I would much rather you guys become obsessed with 1 and just learn everything there is to do with LinkedIn, every single thing. I'm gonna learn every single thing that's working over there. I'm gonna learn all the different strategies. I'm gonna start following people over there. I'm gonna start consuming content over there. I'm gonna create a ton of stuff over there. I'm gonna test a whole bunch of stuff, and I'm gonna be obsessed with one platform.\
\
Faith Mariah [00:17:59]:\
So pick your one obsession platform. Okay. These are the main ways I'm seeing people do this right now. There's always exceptions to every rule, but I do work with a lot of people. I have hundreds of clients and hundreds of students, so, you know, this is not based on nothing. Generally, you guys will be in one of these these places. Okay? You'll either be on TikTok, Instagram reels. Not Instagram on the grid yet.\
\
Faith Mariah [00:18:24]:\
I do see carousels starting to come back and get some reach but not as much as Reels still. LinkedIn, I'm seeing people getting traction on LinkedIn where their LinkedIn is actually putting their content in front of people because they want content creators over there. Instagram threads is an amazing opportunity. I'm seeing a lot of my students get traction over there right now. All of these change, by the way. So where the organic reach is and where kind of the best place is to get new people and get new eyeballs on your stuff changes all the time. So don't be attached to, like, this is my strategy and it's gonna be my strategy till I die. It's like this is my strategy for now until the platform changes, then I'm gonna have to do something else.\
\
Faith Mariah [00:18:59]:\
Right? The online space is an inherently unstable place, meaning it changes all the time. Right? This is what I'm saying about you need to just become a fast decision maker because I can debate on this and research on this and think about this all day. And then if TikTok gets deleted, like, all that research was for nothing. Right? So So we don't know what's gonna happen in the future and all these platforms are very unstable. They're sold all the time. They merge all the time. They close down all the time. The reach changes.\
\
Faith Mariah [00:19:29]:\
The algorithm changes. Everything changes. So LinkedIn, I'm seeing people having really good looks, really good reach on threads. Ads, I don't usually recommend people start with ads. The only exception I really have to that is if you have a high paying job and you do not have a lot of time, you can substitute ads as a way for people to find you. So you don't have to mess with social media. You don't have to do any of that. You have to spend the time and money to learn ads, which is not a small investment.\
\
Faith Mariah [00:19:57]:\
But then once you know how to do it, you can use that to drive traffic. But most of us be bootstrapping our businesses out here. Right? I get it because that's how I did my business too. So I don't usually recommend you guys start doing ads until you have a really great sales system, and you're like, if I could get in front of more people, I know I would have more buyers. Right? Until you have that sales system, running ads is kinda gonna be flushing money. Okay? Collaboration. So doing things like this, I'm collaborating with Liz right now, doing summits, doing bundles. We host bundles all the time.\
\
Faith Mariah [00:20:27]:\
You can go to faithmariahevents.com. We're almost always recruiting for our bundles. I'd love to have you in them. Google. So this is blogging. Right? So most of you are probably going to want to be over on Google or Pinterest to get eyeballs on your blog. Right? And then YouTube. I'm still seeing people get a lot of traffic over on YouTube.\
\
Faith Mariah [00:20:44]:\
So you're going to pick these pick one of these right now. Okay? Because we're going to go on to the next part. So how are people going to find you? They can't pay you if they don't know you exist. Where are we going to be? You're probably gonna be picking one of these. There are exceptions to that, but generally this is the places I'm seeing people, that is working the best. Okay. We're trucking along our little map. We're at free results, right, so we're gonna get people results ahead of time.\
\
Faith Mariah [00:21:10]:\
We're gonna nurture them. We're gonna prove we can help them. We're not gonna expect them to think we can help them until we help them. We're not gonna expect them to wanna buy from us until we prove we know what we're doing, right? So this is difficult to do because it's not just like vomiting tons of free information. It's like can you take someone and get them to take an action and get a different result in their life? That is hard to do, right? It takes a lot of, encouragement. It takes a lot of follow-up. It takes a lot of all of the things. Okay? So I want you to pick one of these for your strategy map.\
\
Faith Mariah [00:21:45]:\
You can do email. I think you should do email with video. So I've been shooting Loom videos, and then I will upload it onto YouTube unlisted, screenshot it in the email because you can't attach a video in an email. I'll screenshot, like, so it looks like the video is there, and then I'll link to that YouTube. So when they click on it, it doesn't play the video, although it looks like it would. It actually takes them over to YouTube. I think people need to see your face and hear your voice. I think it's more and more difficult to just sell on email when people have not seen and heard from you.\
\
Faith Mariah [00:22:15]:\
I know a lot of you guys are not gonna like that. I was terrified of being on camera when I started. I swore I would never be on camera. I totally get it. But I'm just being straight with you. Like, it is harder to do sales online and the old ways of just sending emails and people will buy things. It's not really like that anymore unless you have a way of getting a ton a ton of value or value? A ton of ton of volume. So if you can get you know, you're getting thousands and thousands of leads a day, probably some of those people will just buy off of email.\
\
Faith Mariah [00:22:43]:\
Right? But if we have a small audience and we're really trying to convert a lot of people, I would start including emails with your videos. So if you're doing a newsletter, just open up Loom. Right? Shoot a video. Say, hey, guys. Like, you know, in the newsletter, I was talking about blah blah blah. This is how it could look, this is whatever, do a little pep talk, give them some encouragement, give them some tips, like, it can be it should be less than 2 minutes, like, short. Okay? YouTube is still great for nurture, so what this looks like is you would keyword those YouTube videos if we were doing it for the people find you. We have to keyword them so they show up in search.\
\
Faith Mariah [00:23:19]:\
And then if we're using it as nurture, you take that link and email it to your list, and you do a good pitch in the email about I just made this YouTube video. Like, this is why you should watch it. This is how it's gonna help you. Are you struggling with x, y, and z? A lot of people that I work with struggle with this. I just shot a video. You guys can watch it for free right here. So then we're sending them to our YouTube video to learn from us so we can get them those results ahead of time. They can get to know us, right? We got to build up that know, like and trust factor.\
\
Faith Mariah [00:23:49]:\
And then podcasting, same thing, right? Do the podcast, send it to your email list. Instagram stories are a great way to show people behind the scenes of your life, especially if you're using Instagram threads or reels. This goes really nice with that. But you can do it the same thing. You can do Instagram stories and then tell your email list, hey, I've been sharing over on my stories, 5 ways to never struggle with whatever again. Go watch today's videos. I'm going to be more tomorrow. So you've got to be giving them a good reason to go consume this stuff.\
\
Faith Mariah [00:24:21]:\
A Facebook group. The Facebook group is not really working very well for getting new people to find you, but if people are joining your email list, we can send them to the Facebook group. So we can do a free workshop every Monday, a mini workshop. It's going to be less than 5 minutes. It's going to get you big results. I do it every single Monday over in my Facebook group and then every Monday you're gonna put that pitch in an email and send it to your list and send them over to your Facebook group. And then something else, like maybe you guys have a different idea. There's lots of different niches.\
\
Faith Mariah [00:24:53]:\
There's lots of different ways to do this stuff, but you need to regularly, I would say weekly at least, be sending something very valuable to the people on your list, right? The more you do this, valuable to the people on your list, right? The more you do this and the better you get at this, the easier it is to convert the people that find you into buyers, right? The best way to get better at this is to practice. Don't try to do it the right way. Be willing to be a beginner. Some of you guys are going to be beginner. Some of you guys are gonna be bad at this. Okay? It's okay. Everybody's bad at bad in the beginning, I promise, and you'll get better over time. So pick one right now for your map.\
\
Faith Mariah [00:25:25]:\
How are you gonna nurture people? Where are you gonna do it? I got to get going fast because I have a bunch of slides, but the last piece you need to pick is what you're going to sell. So the most important part of this is you need to know the problem your people have that they want to pay to fix, The problem they have that they want to pay to fix. A lot of entrepreneurs I see that stay stuck are trying to solve a problem people don't know they have. They're trying to solve a problem for people that don't have money. I would not build a business solving those problems. I would solve a problem people know they have and they want to pay to fix. Okay. People will pay money for entertainment, right? So the problem you would be solving is essentially boredom or being uninspired.\
\
Faith Mariah [00:26:05]:\
Right? So figure out the problem you solve that people want to pay to fix and then the format for that solution. So a lot of people are like, do I do a course? Do I do coaching? Do I do a workbook? Do I do product? It doesn't really matter as much as do you have a problem you can solve that people want to pay to fix And then you can deliver it whatever way you want. You could do a private podcast. You could do a workshop. You could do a challenge. You could do done for you. Like, I'm gonna literally do this for you, whatever you want. And then you need to decide when and how you will sell it, when and how you will sell it.\
\
Faith Mariah [00:26:37]:\
And again, this is in the Notion dashboard. faithmariah.com/map. I got to get a move on, but I want you guys to decide these three questions. Okay. Problem you solve, format you solve it in, when and how you're going to sell it. Okay. So that's your strategy map. You need to have that.\
\
Faith Mariah [00:26:55]:\
You need to have that. I cannot stress enough. Like, please do not work on your business without having that done because you're going to waste so much time. So have that done. We're going to test it for 90 days, and I'm going to get you you through this execution plan super fast. So the execution plan, you're gonna do this for each step. So you're gonna go through find you, what are you doing, how often are you doing it, when are you gonna do it, and where will you keep track of it. Again, all these questions are in the Notion dashboard.\
\
Faith Mariah [00:27:21]:\
You're gonna do that for your find you, your free results, your buy. I have a example on the next slide. So for each part of the strategy map, you need to create an execution plan. Here's what that looks like for the first step. So the first step is people find you, right? What are you doing? This person is going to do blog posts and they're going to post them on Pinterest. Okay. That's how people are going to find them. That first step.\
\
Faith Mariah [00:27:44]:\
How often are you doing it? They're going to do weekly blog posts and they're going to post on Pinterest 2 times a day. When are you going to do it? Weekly blog posts. They're going to write on the weekend and schedule it to go live on Monday. When are you going to do it? Pinterest 2 times per day. They're going to do it after work. Okay. So what are you doing? How often are you doing it? When are you going to do it? And where will you keep track of it? So you need to have somewhere all this stuff lives so that you're not sitting down thinking, do I need to do a blog post today? Do I need to do Pinterest? Do I need to send an email? You're going to put all those tasks in a scheduling system. You're going to open that scheduling system when you sit down on your computer and just follow that list.\
\
Faith Mariah [00:28:26]:\
And that's how you can cut your hours. If you are serious about wanting to get more done in less time, you have to have somewhere where you can organize your tasks and you'll spend no time deciding what to do and all of your time executing. Okay? If you're like, I have no idea how to organize my tasks, how to structure that, I have a free training that I show you how to set this up using Google tools, which are all free, and I'm gonna put the link in the faithmariah.com/map so it's in that Notion web page for you guys, and you need to go through and make your execution plan. We just did the find you section. You're still gonna need to do the free results and the buyer. But I promise you, if you can make that plan and then start sticking to it, you're gonna be blown away at what you can get done this year. If you spend time dabbling around, not knowing what to do, being confused, being slow at making decisions, you know, you're going to spend a lot of time making very little progress. If you make this plan and you just concentrate on executing your tasks every day that you plan to do, that's a skill you have to build.\
\
Faith Mariah [00:29:29]:\
Right? You have to start building the discipline and the skill of sitting down at your computer, opening your plan and following your task list. So go to faithmariah.com/map if you want the free Google training, and I show you how to set up your plan in Google step by step. It's really easy, and like I said, these are all free tools. Okay. That's it. I hope this was helpful. If this is helpful to you, I would love to hear your comments if you like it. I'm just recording this in my room by myself, so it helps me know that you guys like this stuff.\
\
Faith Mariah [00:30:00]:\
If you have questions, I'm happy to answer them. You know, post them, and I will come back and answer all your questions. I'm happy to do that. Go to faithmariah.com/map, and you'll get the long the the long workshop notes. You'll get the coupon code. You'll get the Google training. I'm putting the notes from this workshop, all the stuff you need to fill out in there for you guys so you can reference it, and a bunch of good stuff in there. So definitely go check that out.\
\
Faith Mariah [00:30:24]:\
I hope you guys enjoy the rest of the event, and have a beautiful day, and I'll talk to you guys soon.\

Alright, guys.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:00:00]:\
We're here with Jen from Jen Williams Agency. I'm super excited for the session because she's gonna be talking about systems for your business. Welcome. Thank you.\
\
Jen Williams [00:00:09]:\
Hi. Thanks for having me. So to give you, really quick what we're gonna be going over today, Basically, we wanna talk about the very basics of the system. So everyone here is you need system. You know, you hear that you need automation, you need process. What does it actually look like when you're at the stage when you're ready for it? Because there's hundreds and hundreds of options when it comes to systems. So what are the ones to focus on in the beginning that actually propel you for growth and are sustainable for scalability? Because there's a lot of them that are really cheap in the beginning, but then you can't use them later on because then you spend hours switching over platforms or whatever it may be. So we're gonna focus on the 2 different versions of systems and what are the actual best softwares to use when you're just starting out and to propel you for growth.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:00:57]:\
That's awesome. Yeah. Because I feel like when you're, you know, attending summits like this Right taking blogging courses or whatever, you always you learn something, and then it just adds to your to do list, And it gets longer\

You don't systemize. Like, there's no way you're gonna you're just gonna end up burnout, and we don't want that. So I'm really excited for your presentation. I can't wait to watch. Let's go ahead and dive in.\
\
Jen Williams [00:01:20]:\
Hello. I'm really glad you're here with us today. So today, we're gonna be talking about building systems for business growth. And let's go ahead and jump straight in so you can maximize your time today. So everything we're gonna be talking about today, who I am and maybe why you should listen to me, what systems are. So when you hear the word system, what are we actually referring to? How to scale your business, so scaling versus actual growth and what the difference is. Growing with software because you need automation and delegation and all that to be able to actually scale. How to choose the right tools because there's a million of them out there, and we all hear they're all right.\
\
Jen Williams [00:01:59]:\
So how do you choose the ones that are actually best for you? What processes have to do with systems and how they can actually help? And then what are just some insider tips that I've gained through all these years of using them that can help you so you can bypass that and jump straight into using them like a pro. So let's go ahead and jump in. So this is me. I'm Jen Williams. I'm the CEO of Jen Williams Agency. We are an operations firm, and so I consider myself an operations authority. I have been doing this for quite a while now. I have a bachelor's in business administration, a project management professional certification, and I'm also certified in by the American Marketing Association.\
\
Jen Williams [00:02:39]:\
And I am personally on a mission to completely eradicate burnout from business. I am obsessed with owning my own company. I love it. I knew I wanted to be an entrepreneur from day 1. But if you don't know exactly how to run the operations, the back end, the behind the scenes stuff, it can be completely overwhelming. And we live in a a world right now that really promotes this hustle, the hustle nation as we call it. And you can get completely burned out if you were out there hustling every single day. And so there's this other side of the world, the the entrepreneur world that is completely bypassed.\
\
Jen Williams [00:03:17]:\
And that's what do we do to prevent burn out. So it's kinda what we're gonna talk about today in regards to systems because that's mainly why we use them, to make everything behind the scenes, run nice and smooth, operate nicely so that you can go ahead about your business. You can focus on the activities that bring in revenue, that keep you in your zone of genius, but then also keep your company really profitable and running smoothly. So I actually spent 9 years in the corporate world. I was climbing the ladder, and the corporate world is just not for me. I was doing really good things in my career, but inside was very, very miserable. And I kept thinking I just need to change my circumstances. All I need to change is the department, and I need to change the company I'm with.\
\
Jen Williams [00:04:05]:\
I need to change my job title. And so I would move around. I spent between the 9 years with 2 different corporations, both very large corporations, and I was miserable in every single role I had. I was really good, and I got really good reviews, but I was completely miserable. So I went ahead and took the jump, the leap, and I went ahead and opened my own operations firm. And luckily, within 3 weeks, I was making full time income and replaced it because I had done all the prep work in regards to the education piece. I knew my material really well. I hadn't really done a whole lot of prep work for my actual business because I kinda just left.\
\
Jen Williams [00:04:43]:\
I kinda just took a big leap of faith. And so within 3 weeks, I was able to turn that around because my how I use systems, because I had everything in place, and I was able to get that full time income replaced within 3 weeks. So I had a really good, circumstance there and was able to really propel my business starting from the ground. I am a very, very big believer in work life balance. I absolutely love working, but I don't wanna work all day long. I love many other things. I love my family. I love reading.\
\
Jen Williams [00:05:14]:\
I love my hobbies. Many other things. I don't love just work. And if you only work if you only do one task, it might be okay for a while, and you might be able to keep chugging along for a while. But there's gonna be a point where you completely burn out no matter how much you enjoy that task. I'm a big believer in managing your work life balance because if you don't, it's gonna manage you. It's gonna control you. And so I am very passionate about this.\
\
Jen Williams [00:05:41]:\
And when I joined into this entrepreneurship world, I kinda noticed that a lot of people skated over that part. They really just promoted this hustle every day, hustle every day. And I'm just not that's not how I wanna operate, and I really wanna help other people learn to operate their company in a way that makes sense for them so they can be healthy too. And so that's why I started operations firm. That's where it all really came from and so I wanna talk today about what actually is ops. When I say the word operations, a lot of times people will look at me like, okay. But what actually is that? So it's all the stuff that has to do with running your business in the back end. So, generally, people start a company because they have one really good zone of genius.\
\
Jen Williams [00:06:26]:\
There's one thing you're really good at. Our example here, we'll use massage therapist. So someone who I have a couple clients who are massage therapists and they are really, really, really good at what they do. All the pieces that go into the back end of running a massage therapy business, they don't really know so much. And so they kinda just wing it. And maybe they'll Google some things. They're getting by and but things aren't there's not really systems. There's not really processes.\
\
Jen Williams [00:06:52]:\
That's where we come in and we kinda implement those. We also focus on a scaling strategy. And we'll talk about what the difference between scaling and growth is in just a moment, but not all business models are meant to be scaled. Not all companies, not all small businesses can scale the way they're set up. Yeah. You can change things. You implement. But not all of them are currently operating on a manner that allows them to scale.\
\
Jen Williams [00:07:15]:\
And I think that's a misconception because a lot of people think they are set up to scale, and all they have to do is increase revenue, and that's all it is. We'll talk about that in just a second. The biggest thing we do with operations is set up processes, implement systems, and create automation. And that's kinda like the the magic trifecta as those three things together that really creates really simple, nicely operating operations. So first, I wanna talk about systems. When I say the word systems, there's kind of 2 different versions that I'm talking to that people generally mean. The first one, you're talking about software applications. They are kinda like the building blocks behind the scenes.\
\
Jen Williams [00:07:57]:\
They're the things that run all the data. They're gonna be the pieces that run the automation. They kinda keep everything flowing and keep everything organized. The other type of system is in reference to creating processes. So So a system in reference to repeating the same thing over and over in the same manner so that it's efficient. That's the type of assess system that I'm referring to, and we will come back to that in a bit here. So using systems to scale. So what the heck do I mean when I say scale versus growth? So a lot of people under the assumption scaling just means increasing revenue, and that's not true.\
\
Jen Williams [00:08:39]:\
So you can have a company that increases revenue, but when you were operating on a basis of trading your time for money and so we go back to our masseuse example. She can only have so many clients per day. She can only have so many per clients per week. Even though she can increase her revenue, she's kinda capped at scaling. So she has to adapt a scaling model. And so a scaling model in that case would be maybe building out a team. That's a scalable model. Maybe you're gonna add in additional services that can be like group programs.\
\
Jen Williams [00:09:14]:\
That's a scaling model. And you're gonna add in a course on how other masseuses can open their own company. That's a scale model. So there's quite a few different options, but recognizing that just trading more of your time for money is not a scalable option. You're gonna be capped eventually. And so that's why the very first thing we do is we determine a scalable model to kinda shift things a little bit so that the company is scalable. So when we apply these systems, it can actually help you scale, not just increase your revenue. And when I'm talking about scaling large and systems, we we wanna make sure that any software you choose and any systems you create, so any process you create are scalable also.\
\
Jen Williams [00:10:01]:\
So you only wanna choose things that can actually grow with you. There are definitely a few exceptions. When you're first starting out, I think there's some things that will you will do that you recognize you're gonna come back and redo once you're at a certain growth. But mainly the the big things that you wanna do at the very beginning to help prevent all that time wasted later. And so the first one, so you definitely wanna have software that can help you scale. And then you also really wanna make sure that your business is based on your personality type. And I know that's not a common thing to kinda hear, but it really helps prevent that burnout. Because if you have chosen a business model that you have been told is successful, that it completely goes against how you operate inside your head and your personality type, you are gonna burn out even quicker and that company is gonna completely fail.\
\
Jen Williams [00:10:56]:\
And you're gonna be stuck at a frustrating point. Like, I thought this was supposed to be successful. What happened? You know? And so to help prevent that burnout, I highly, highly recommend everyone take a moment to kinda evaluate if the scaling model you've chosen really represents your personality. And that's kinda one thing we go through with clients. We make sure that they have chosen a scaling model that works well with them, that can run long term, is not gonna burn them out just by being present. So a good example is, a group coaching program. So let's say you're the type of person who gets really, really, really exhausted with people, and there's definitely, you know, strong introverts. I'm I'm a strong introvert.\
\
Jen Williams [00:11:43]:\
If you have to manage how much exposure you have to people every day so you can manage your energy inside your body, well, a program where you are back to back meetings with people is not gonna be it. So So maybe your program needs to look a little bit different rather than 1 on 1 work. Maybe it's a group, so you're exposed to if you're doing a group call where there's 50 people on the call versus a 1 on 1 call or something like that. You know what I mean? There's a lot of different manners, but you just need to take it into and make sure you're thinking about that. What is your actual personality type? Is the model you're choosing going with it or against it? Because a lot of people, I'll hear them say things like, oh, I can fake it for a little bit or I think it'll be okay. It's not really congruent with who I am, but I think I can handle that a little bit. And then I'll in the rest of my time, I'll do something I enjoy. Well, that'll work for a while, but it really will lead to burnout in the long run.\
\
Jen Williams [00:12:42]:\
So if you can stop now and choose now a model that works for your personality type, it can be much better for the long run. And so going back to the software options, when you're using systems to scale, there is so many software options and every single software pitches themselves as the only one you need and the number one in their category. And everyone talks about the soft current software they're using is amazing. So it kinda gives you this endless sea of options, and it becomes very overwhelming. You don't know which ones you should actually focus on, let alone which companies, which categories. I think that's a big one. A lot of people get so wrapped up in, should I go with Trello? Should I go with Asana? I never stop and think, do I need a product manager? You know? So is my company one that actually needs this type of category of software? And we kinda get that a little bit because we come from a we're in a world where everyone's pitching us the cure. Everyone's pitching their system is the the best system, and that is great.\
\
Jen Williams [00:13:54]:\
You can get a lot of information that way. However, it implies that everything is needed, and that's definitely not the case. So we definitely want to manage what is actually needed, what's needed for you, and what's best for your situation. So when I am working with someone and they are in the kind of the beginning stages, they have seen growth, they've seen revenue, and now they're really starting to kick it up in gear, they know they need systems. There's generally 3 places I recommend they start. I always say, ignore everything else, go with these 3 to begin with. These are the ones that are gonna help your business grow. These are the ones that are gonna help you scale, and you're gonna see the growth most growth with these.\
\
Jen Williams [00:14:35]:\
So first one is your business management software. This one is going to be the one that you send proposals with, that you can sign contracts, and you can send invoices with that generally has some sort of CMR built in, that generally has, some sort of project management task management, and we'll go through that in just a moment. The next one is a project management software. This is gonna be your task management working with the team, and the last one is your CRM. This is where be where you track all your leads and all your clients and all your future leads. And so let's go ahead and dive in and talk about the first one, the business management software. So the first system regarding your company, like I said, is business management software. What are what actually is that? It's gonna be a software that generally has more than one function to it.\
\
Jen Williams [00:15:29]:\
And the reason I recommend this from people who are first starting is because it's a really good base to start with that is very simple. It puts everything in one place. You don't need to learn 15 different softwares. You need to learn 1, and then I'll take care of a wide variety of stuff. Like I said, a lot of them have task management built in. Some even have project management built in, which is really great. They're gonna have some way to track your leads and your clients. Some of them have a client dashboard.\
\
Jen Williams [00:15:58]:\
Your clients can log in. You're gonna be able to send proposals, sign contracts. Some even allow accounting built in. Basically, it's a software that has a lot of different functions for small businesses. Some really good examples are Plutio. I absolutely love Plutio. It's the one I use myself. I really like them because they have not only task management, but a really robust project manager built in.\
\
Jen Williams [00:16:23]:\
So I actually don't need a separate project manager because Plutio has that built in. Not all of them do have that built in, but that is one that does. And I really highly recommend that Plutio. 17 hats and Dubsado are also amazing. They have a lot more features than Plutio, but the downside is they don't really have that robust project manager. But if you just need task management and what the difference is is project management is more for teams where you're delegating. Task manager is just a list of things you need to do. Those are really amazing options, and those have really robust options like, client dashboards, and they do have some automation built into not really robust but some, and so it's really awesome.\
\
Jen Williams [00:17:09]:\
I know Dubsado now has, like, forms built in and a scheduler. And so it really brings everything in one place and can make managing your business very simple. So rather than trying to figure out a software to do my accounting, a software to do my invoicing, a software to sign contracts, a software to send, my task management, It combines it all in one place and makes your life and your operations so much more simple. It also sets you up for growth because once you're at the stage where you're ready for a team, everything's nicely organized. They can easily hop in, and you can train them easier because you're only training them on one software. As you do grow, you will probably eventually need something more robust. And what I mean by that is when you have a software that offers all those different things, they are not going to be generally, they are not the best at every single thing they do. So a good example so Dubsado does proposals.\
\
Jen Williams [00:18:11]:\
They do amazing proposals. Those are definitely what you need in the beginning. But if you have a sales heavy company or you are sending tons of proposals every week, you're probably gonna wanna eventually move on to a proposal only software that offers 100 and 100 of features and and automations, stuff like that. But you don't need that until you are making way more revenue. You don't even need to touch that. You will probably have, like, a team of 10. You'll probably be making over 500,000 a year before you need that, stuff like that. Because a business major software is definitely gonna suit your needs for now and as you scale up.\
\
Jen Williams [00:18:50]:\
But I do want to rep I like to do mention it to people that you will eventually need a more robust one, And that's kinda what leads me into the next 2 recommendations, kind of setting you up for that. So and I also wanna recommend or mention, it's not just about cost when you're comparing them. So when you're trying to figure out which one, it's not just about pricing, but about the features they offer and about how much time it saves you. Because the back end of your company is it takes a lot to run everything. They say, generally, for every hour of client work you have, you have an hour of back end. So if you were doing 20 hours of client work a week, plan on 20 hours of back end a week also. It can get very overwhelming. And so when you have a nice system set up, that can really help decrease the amount of hours you're having to throw into that.\
\
Jen Williams [00:19:40]:\
So that leads us to the next one. When you have start to build out a more team a bigger team, so you've gotten revenue and you've gotten to the stage or you're kinda focusing more on, like, the revenue generating stuff, now you're building a team, you are definitely gonna need a project management software. If you go with, business management that have, like, Plutio where you have that project manager built in, that's great. But if you do not have one, now you're gonna be at the stage where you kinda wanna start looking for project management software. Some people set this up from the very beginning, and that's absolutely great, definitely worthwhile. So some common ones are, like, ClickUp, Teamwork, and Monday. These are my 3 favorite that I recommend. Out of those 3, Teamwork is my absolute favorite.\
\
Jen Williams [00:20:24]:\
Teamwork is very robustly built. They really it's user focused when they were building it, and you can really tell, the way they have the landing pages and the dashboards and all that was really thought out with the user in mind. It makes very logical sense, you know, where to click and how to send stuff to other team members, and they have a lot of integrations from other like like Google Drive and Dropbox and all that. It makes it very seamless. It makes delegating work very quickly. It makes organizing projects really easy. There's a lot of templates you can use. There's built in automation.\
\
Jen Williams [00:21:04]:\
It just makes everything very smooth. Makes running a team very, very efficient. So one so couple things you wanna look for in a project manager, you obviously want task management. You wanna be able to sign projects and tasks. But even more importantly, you wanna look at your ability to communicate. You wanna be able to communicate on a task level, so you wanna be able to make comments on the task. You wanna be able to communicate on a team level, so maybe, like, a conversation or, like, a Slack or chat type feature, stuff like that, which Teamwork also has. You wanna be able to include lots of your own content in it, so you don't wanna be limited to how many, like, projects you have.\
\
Jen Williams [00:21:49]:\
And you also want to be able to handle a lot of different variety. And so what I mean by that is you don't wanna pick a software where it's really good for client work but not good for external work, stuff like marketing, stuff like that. So a really good project manager allows you to combine both of them and has it set up for both. And then your next piece of software that you're definitely gonna wanna have and wanna develop is a CRM, a customer relationship management software. And so I highly, highly recommend HubSpot, Zoho, or Capsule. Zoho and HubSpot are amazing and you can do so much with them, but very overwhelming. So if you want something that is really, really good and very simple to use, I highly suggest starting with Capsule. Capsule integrates with a lot of other companies, softwares, have a lot of features, but it's quick to learn.\
\
Jen Williams [00:22:46]:\
It's very easy to learn. And so, basically, why you want this is so you wanna be able to very easily manage every time you're communicating with your clients, with your leads, with people on social media before you get to leads, you know, stuff like that. And it's really important that you are managing these and that you have a system set up because you wanna be able to not automate your responses but automate the quality control. Because without that quality control piece, stuff falls through the cracks and you get terrible client experiences, and it can really hurt your company in the long run. So it's not just for the sales process, which it is very useful for the sales process, but also for the client experience process. Now when you're first starting out and you're using a business management software like 17 Hats, Dubsado, and even Plutio, they do all have some CRM built in, and it's definitely fine from the beginning. Once you have a lot of leads and once you have a lot of clients coming in, you want a more robust CRM because you wanna be able to manage them all efficiently. You don't have to be doing a lot of leg work yourself.\
\
Jen Williams [00:24:02]:\
So there are quite a few other options for softwares. But like I said, these are the 3 I recommend starting with. And of the 3, I recommend starting with the business management software. That's really, really gonna change your company around. It's gonna completely clean up all the back end stuff. It's gonna make it a lot more simple because you're all doing it in one place. And then once you get to the point where you have a bigger team, you have more sales, you need the other softwares, move on to project management and CRM. And those are the 3 you should be focusing on.\
\
Jen Williams [00:24:32]:\
Those are gonna be your biggest bang for your buck. Those are the ones you wanna invest your money in, stuff like that. Maybe use the free versions for anything else that you need, but these are the 3 that are gonna be worthwhile to spend money on. So how do you choose the one that works for you? So it is kind of a scary experience. This is the number one thing I hear from clients is I just don't know what to choose. And so I do wanna walk through a few things to help you choose the right tools for your company. So first off, I want you to list out what features you need ahead of time because I will tell you this. There's gonna be tons of features that you don't need.\
\
Jen Williams [00:25:10]:\
There's gonna be when you're doing your research, you're gonna come across a lot of other stuff and you're gonna get sidetracked because it seems awesome that it has this cool feature. But if you don't need that feature, you are gonna completely waste your money on it, your time on it, and your time is better spent with other revenue producing tasks rather than using it buying and using a software that you didn't even need that certain feature for. So I always suggest start with a list of actual features you need. Then head over to g2.com. They have really amazing side by side comparison. So you can look at the different software tools and see which ones have those features and kinda compare pricing and features from there. Like, again, I said don't get too distracted by features that you don't need. They will hurt you in the long run.\
\
Jen Williams [00:26:03]:\
You can think ahead. If so, maybe you're at a point where maybe you're not even sending proposals yet. Your company is brand new, and you're not really even handling that yet. But you probably you know your company is gonna be heading to that very soon. We'll work that into the consideration too because you don't wanna take the time to set this up and then a week later, oh, now you need that feature. So and the last one is always make sure they have automation because like I said, automation is gonna be what saves you in the long run. It's gonna save you all this time. Make sure they have automation because not all of them do.\
\
Jen Williams [00:26:36]:\
And so it is a key function that you definitely need if you want it to be scalable. Now if you are a company of 1 and you are very, very happy not choosing a scaling model, then that's a 100% okay, a lot of freelancers are that model where they aren't really trying to adapt a scaling model, they're just growing their revenue and they're very happy, that would be a really good example where maybe automation isn't a 100% needed. It still could be beneficial, but not a 100% as needed. So remember when we were talking about that other type of system and I was talking about systems as processes? I wanna come back and briefly talk about that. So why is it important that you create processes? Processes are what saves you time in the end. And, basically, a process is anything that you do repeatedly in a set format. Anything that you repeat more than once and you're gonna do the same way each time. You've thus created a process.\
\
Jen Williams [00:27:36]:\
And so why is that important? Well, it's important to do it the same way each time for quality control, for efficiency, and to kinda work out the kinks in the system to work out if there's anything wrong with that process. And if you haven't documented it or you haven't at least acknowledged it's done the the same way, it can be really hard to work out those kinks, and that's kind of where those bottlenecks come in. That's where you get the frustrations from customers or you're frustrated and kinda leads to burnout is having basically, like, organization for all the tasks you do is a good way to look at it. So I do recommend creating your processes, and I recommend documenting them. And there can be a couple different ways you can actually type out all your processes on, like, a word document. But even an easier way is just to record yourself doing them and then using that as a reference guide makes it a lot easier. So like I said, processes can really help with streamlining because there's a kind of a magical thing that happens once you start the documenting process. It's kinda like when you're teaching someone else, you recognize you you see that from a different angle and you recognize the the pitfalls, the error the errors and stuff like that.\
\
Jen Williams [00:28:58]:\
And so it helps you create a more efficient process naturally by just the act of documentation. It helps create consistency. So especially anything that has to do with clients, that's always where I suggest starting with process creation is anything that has to do with clients. Because when you've created a process the same way of doing the task, you create consistency, and you can now deliver value to your clients on a consistent basis. So everyone's getting the same level of quality from you. I do highly recommend creating your processes even if you are a company of 1 because what happens is once you grow and you are you have the team members and a team underneath you, you're suddenly at the stage of business where you're so busy you don't have time to create those processes. So right now when you're a company of 1, it's very easy to go ahead and stop and use them and create them then. So I do recommend creating them at that point.\
\
Jen Williams [00:29:55]:\
I I do wanna go through a few tips that I have that I've learned over the years. I've created hundreds and hundreds of process for people. So kinda and I set up software for people. This is kinda the tips I kinda wanna go over. So first, I always recommend write down a list of all the tasks you do each day. Take all those tasks that you've done, group them together in function. These are what I call departments, and a lot of people are like, I'm just a company of 1. I don't have departments, but you do.\
\
Jen Williams [00:30:24]:\
Accounting, marketing, management, stuff like that. So divide them into your functions. Assign all the tasks that are in those functions priority. And so it can be as simple as an we just follow a stoplight procedure. So, you know, stop red, green go, slow, which is medium for us is yellow, and that makes it very easy to see. So you see red things, you know, stop. Green, you know to go. Yellow, kind of in the middle, you know, stuff like that.\
\
Jen Williams [00:30:55]:\
So assign it all a priority. You can use a couple different prioritization systems, but that's the one stoplight method is kinda the one I like the best. Go and download an SOP template. There's tons of them out there for free. I have one on my website. There's other great ones also. And then create processes for all those tasks you have listed. I know it seems very overwhelming when you have that giant list, but just start one at a time and you'll fly through it.\
\
Jen Williams [00:31:23]:\
And then take them and create a catalog for easy reference. One tip I like to have to make is to, like I said, use video if you don't want to. So what I do, I know I'm already going to be doing the task. I will record myself doing it and then boom, use that as my documentation. It's a video SOP because it's already I I didn't have take any extra time to go ahead and produce that, and now it's already available. It's already recorded as an SOP for me. And so that is all of our building systems for business growth. I hope that really helps you learn what systems that you need, especially at what stage your business and what's right for you and how to go ahead and research what's right for you.\
\
Jen Williams [00:32:10]:\
And then also the other type of system, we're talking about process and why they're important and how to actually create them.\
\

[00:00:11.970] - Jessica Dornieden\
Hello, hello, and welcome to the next presentation in the Blogger Breakthrough Summit. I am going to be specifically talking about automations for blogging today. That is the more technical aspect of trying to take some of the repetitiveness out of the blogging process so that you can end up putting out more content and focusing on creating quality stuff, instead of having to repetitively copy and paste things from one place to another. So yeah, this is probably going to be a more technical presentation, but don't worry, I'm going to take you through it step by step, but please don't zone out before we've even started.\
\
[00:00:57.810] - Jessica\
Right, first things first, I want to introduce myself. I'm Jess. I mostly work with business owners that are stuck in the messy middle of growing their business. I do that by solving their tech challenges, their systems challenges, so that they can stop putting out dumpster fires every single day and instead focus on bringing their ideas for their business to life. I call myself mostly a tech and systems implementer because that's what I do. I go and build things for people so that just stuff runs smoothly. However, whenever I'm working with people in the very long term, I have a lot of conversations with them around things like content, marketing, advertising, funnels. So yeah, it's not limited only to your tech setup. I've been doing this since 2016, which now seems a very long time ago. In that time, I've probably built out hundreds of different funnels, courses, membership sites, checkouts, email automations, project management setups, and whatnot. That's been most of what I've been doing.\
\
[00:02:03.750] - Jessica\
And then most recently I was fractional CTO and CMO for a seven-figure coaching business. So they had about 15 team members, and I've mostly been focused on the digital product funnels. So working with the copywriter and the designer to optimize and run split tests on all of the different funnels. So that's what I've recently spent my time doing. Right now you may end up seeing yourself as a blogger. However, I see you as an entrepreneur that's ready to make things happen. And that's how I'm going to be speaking to you today because I want you to put your, "I'm running a business" hat on instead of just thinking about, oh yeah, I can do this little blog thing on the side, because it takes way more than that.\
\
[00:02:54.410] - Jessica\
On a personal note, I suspect that I am an ADHD human. I have no way of verifying that where I currently live, but it is what it is. I grew up in Germany, lived in the UK for 11 years, and I've been in Albania for the last four years. I am mostly fueled by coffee. I've got my trusty coffee with me right now. When I'm not working, I'm currently nerding out a little bit on learning Python for data science because I'm interested in the whole AI thing, but I don't have the tech foundation to explore this more, so that's why I'm doing a lot of courses on the side at the moment. Overall, I love tech, I love systems, I love automation, and I love data so that we can make better business decisions, and that is how my brain works.\
\
[00:03:48.760] - Jessica\
What are we going to be covering today? I want to talk about systems and automation for blogging. The thing that I want to make really, really clear is that I am 100% tool-agnostic in my work. It's not that people haven't told me for the last seven years that, "Oh, Jess, you must specialize into using just one software, and then you can be known as the industry expert for that specific software." Today's training is probably the reason why I refuse to do that. It really comes down to the fact that tools are just tools, and they are to be used to serve a purpose for people. I really want to be sure that whenever I'm recommending something to you or whenever I'm setting something up for you, I recommend you use stuff that lets you implement your process in a way that it works for you, your business, your team members, your brain, and everything. I can't do that if I limit the choices of tools or software that I work with. That's something that I want to say from the beginning.\
\
[00:05:00.900] - Jessica\
Most things I'm going to say today are applicable no matter which tool you're choosing to use. I want us to focus more on the process and the idea behind what I'm talking about today rather than click here, click here, click here, click here because that changes every two weeks, to be honest. One of the first pieces of advice that new business owners are often given is when you are out of time, just hire a VA, and I 100% disagree. My first recommendation is that you look at your process and you check if it's actually as efficient as it possibly could be and then you look into, do you need to be doing all of those things or can you drop any of the things that you're currently doing? Then you're going to look at which part of the process can I automate so that no human has to waste their time copying things from A to B. And the things that are then remaining, they are the ones that I would outsource to somebody else if I have the funds to do so, okay? So my first piece of advice is actually to stop doing shit that doesn't get you any results. My second piece of advice is to automate the rest and then to hand off whatever can't be automated. Now basically, by the end of this presentation, I want you to understand how can I look at my blogging process and, what are my options for automating this process as much as possible.\
\
[00:06:29.280] - Jessica\
My starting pointer, whenever I talk about automations, whenever I talk about tools, when I talk about software, is that this is not about the tool. It's about you having a system that works for you and then finding the perfect tools to make that happen for you. That's why it's called a tool, okay? And using a tool or not using a tool does not make you successful. So just because a famous person here that you follow uses ThriveCart to sell their offers, that doesn't mean that you need to be using ThriveCart. It means that maybe it's a good product or it means that it's too expensive for you. It is not worth it for you. So please don't chase after shiny objects. This is something particularly I find in the digital content product space is something super common. Hey, there's a shiny new platform that does X. "I don't even do that in my business, but maybe I should sign up for it," alright? And that is not the way that anything is going to work out for you, right? So none of the trainings that I provide require you to use a exact specific type of tool. They are just all options, and you're going to need to pick the one that most suits you and your business, and what you want to automate.\
\
[00:07:54.050] - Jessica\
Now to me, there are three steps that you're going to go through when it comes to leveraging automation for your blogging process. The first thing that you have to do is you actually need a solid process that works before you're going to automate anything. The second thing is that you then need to develop a plan for actually being able to implement automation. The third thing you're going to do is to build out your system, test it, and then review it. I'm going to talk you through these three steps, and then I'm actually going to record a screen share, and I'll talk you through how I am going to be revamping some of my blogging process, which I've had on my list to do for the longest time. I'm going to set it all up, and I'm going to show you how it works, and then I'm going to show you how to set up the automation and how much of it can actually be done without me having to manually do anything, okay? Then I'll give you some action steps and also a way in which you can get more support.\
\
[00:08:59.450] - Jessica\
Let's kick it off. I talked about process, and I said that before you can automate anything in life, you need an actual process that works. That, unfortunately, requires you to do the thing manually many, many, many, many, many, many times. The next time that you publish new content on your blog, I want you to simple way, take pen and paper and write down. First I do this, then I do this, then I go here, then I make this. Then I download this file. Then I upload this here. Then I write this here. Then I put this here. I want you to write it all down from start to finish. Then once you've documented and written it down somewhere, I want you to actually look at this process because sometimes we do things in an order that doesn't make sense, and then we end up having to touch the same thing three times. So, do the task manually for a while, then document the process, and then work on making it really, really, really efficient. And that is the way in which I review any kind of process, particularly if there's multiple people involved. And then once it's working and you're sure that it is literally the leanest, thinnest process that it could be, it has the least number of steps, it has the least number of tool switches, only then you're going to be ready to actually look at automating and iterating on this process because a process is never final. Ideally, I would say once every three to six months, particularly if it's something you do a lot, you're going to want to review that process because tools change, systems change, things get updated. There could be a better way for you to be doing the thing that you're doing. To be honest, if you're publishing five, six, seven, eight posts or more a week and you shave 10 minutes off of the time that it takes to make that post happen, every week you're going to get an hour or more of your time back because there's 10 minutes you're not spending on nonsense, okay?\
\
[00:11:10.460] - Jessica\
Processes don't just get created once they get created, and then they get reviewed regularly and updated. If you don't know what you need to do, then you can't automate it. If you are listening to this right now and you're very new to blogging and you don't really know what you're doing yet and, you keep forgetting to do some of the things and then you have to come back to it a week later, what you need is you need a process that works. If you're at that stage, close this presentation. I think there's going to be an availability to purchase access to these presentations after, if I remember correctly, buy that and then come back to this in a little while because right now you need to focus on getting a process that works and you don't need to hear about automation because it'll fill your brain with stuff you're not ready for and this information will not go away. You can look it up again in three months time.\
\
[00:12:04.580] - Jessica\
Let's say you have your process. You are sure that this is like smooth AF from start to finish. There's no waste of time, no unnecessary tool switching. It is lean, lean, lean. Then next we're going to want to develop our plan for actually automating this process that you've written down. You need to look at all of the options out there for building automations that accommodate as much of your process as it currently is as possible. You're going to end up using some tools like, for example, Zapier or make.com, which used to be called, I think, Integromat. What you can and can't automate is entirely dependent on your tech stack. For example, if you write all of your content in Notion and you've chosen Zapier to connect Notion to WordPress, for example, then you're going to be limited in the data that you can send automatically from Notion to WordPress without having to copy and paste it. That is because Zapier is extremely slow with updating the API integrations. So if you are a heavy Notion user, then you're not going to want to sign up for Zapier, you're going to want to sign up for make.com because make.com has a way better integration with Notion. If you, however, do all of your blogging and you write all of your posts in your Google Drive account, then you're perfectly fine to use Zapier because there isn't any challenge with the integration with Google Docs because it's been running for years and years and years and years and a gazillion people use it. So it's a really good integration.\
\
[00:13:54.580] - Jessica\
So depending on the tools that you use in your blogging process, you're going to want to choose an automation software that actually works really well with those specific tools that you are using. And then once you have that picked, you want to try and automate as much of that as possible. And here's my honest recommendation. A lot of people get stuck when it comes to growing and optimizing their business because they are married to one specific tool. They love ConvertKit as an email service provider so much that come hell or high water, they will stick with ConvertKit. Even if there's another platform out there that does what they specifically need for their blog, for their business, it does that one million times better, faster, more reliably, more efficiently, whatever, they will still stick with ConvertKit and bang their head against the wall instead of just switching providers.\
\
[00:14:53.880] - Jessica\
My best recommendation is if you're currently handling your blogging process in a project management software that's really hard to integrate with anything else, switch flipping project management softwares to something else because there isn't anything that you can't figure out. It is an investment of maybe two, three hours to move your existing stuff from one project management software to another. But that allows you to access better quality automations, and therefore it is time you are not spending on manually doing things, or paying a virtual assistant to do instead of you. So not switching tools a lot of times can cost you a lot of money, and it's money you're basically throwing right out the window and you could be investing that into other things, okay? Then the last step, once we know what exactly the process is, we know which tools we can and can't use to automate it, the next step is to actually build out your system. As I said, sometimes the system that you can build is limited by your tools, and you should always consider changing it because it will help you in the long term to just turn this into a more successful venture.\
\
[00:16:10.580] - Jessica\
Now I'm going to actually go into a screen share on how I build out a system. I'm going to show you an example, very short process that I would like to have flowing and I would like to automate. Whenever I set up a new blog post in Notion, where I usually only note down the title of the post that I'm going to write, I want to automatically create a new Google Doc in a specific folder that is called 'Drafts,' and I want the title from Notion to be moved into that Google Doc automatically so that I don't have to create it. Then I'm going to write the content inside this Google Doc, manually. When I move that Google Doc to another folder called 'Final', then I want that content of that Google Doc to be sent to WordPress automatically, right? Then once the post is published, I would like to send this to my social media scheduler. I use Metricool, and in Metricool they have a feature called 'Autolists.' As soon as I've published a blog post, I would like it to automatically be added to one of my auto lists, all right?\
\
[00:17:20.850] - Jessica\
This is an example process.This is a very shortened version of all of the steps that go into writing a blog post. But this endless copying and pasting from one place to another, it always means that stuff goes missing and it's a lot of manual effort that I don't think I should have to be doing. I'm going to show you how to hopefully get all of this done and stay within the time limit of this lovely presentation. The first thing that I need to make sure that I have set up is in my Google Drive, I'm going to need a 'Blog folder' and I'm going to need the 'Drafts' and the 'Final' subfolder in here so that I'm ready to go. I also need to have my Notion database where I write down the ideas for new blog posts ready to go. I have that already because I currently use Notion to write all this stuff down.\
\
[00:18:08.560] - Jessica\
Then the next thing I'm going to need is I'm going to need an automation tool. In this case, I use Zapier already, so I'm just going to show you how to set this up in Zapier. But as I said, you could use make.com as well, particularly if you're using Notion to actually write your full blog posts and you want to continue to do that, you don't want to switch to Google Drive, then for sure you're going to want to use make.com, not Zapier. You're just going to go on the big button up here that says, "Create a Zap." Now, what is a Zap? A Zap is simply a connection between two tools that wouldn't usually be talking to each other. The way that a Zap works is that it always has a trigger and an action. "When this happens, do that." In this case, when I add a new database entry in Notion, then create a Google Doc in the folder called Drafts. This is basically the connection from this to this is the first step or the first Zap that we're going to set up. You can either write up here in this box. This works sometimes and not other times. I'm just going to manually set this up. The first app that triggers this whole process starting is Notion. Now I'm going to have to choose an event. In this case, I would say maybe it's going to be a new database item."Continue." My Notion account's already connected. If yours is not, there'll be a button here that says, "Connect" and then a pop-up will open and you just have to connect your account. Continue the trigger. Here, I need to choose the database that I would like to use. Here's my content repository, which is what I use in my template to store all of my content. Now it's found the database, it's going to test the trigger and it's going to make sure that it finds whatever item. This is actually going to be a blog post. That works fine. "Continue with selected record." Now the place where I want the action to take place is Google Docs. I'm going to select Google Docs and I would like it to "Create document from Text." "Continue, continue." Again, if your account isn't connected, you're going to have to connect your account. The document name is actually going to be the same as the Title of my Notion database entry. I'm just going to click on Title and it will dynamically pull in the title automatically from Notion. The document content for me is actually going to be blank, but blank isn't an option. I have to actually put something in the document. I'm just going to put the title in there again at the top of the document. Then I have to select the folder. "Here, Folder." Okay, so blog is here. And then inside Blog, I have the folder 'Drafts.' This is where I wanted to create this fresh Google Doc so I can work in it." Continue." Now it's going to ask you to test the action. You're going to say test step. If we now go into Google Drive and this is all worked, then we should find a document in there. It says, "A document was sent to Google Docs one second ago." Go in here, 'Drafts' and yes, here is the actual document that it's just created. And inside the document, we just have the title again because we couldn't leave it blank, right? This is now in my 'Drafts' folder and this is ready to go automatically for me to write my content into. This Zap now, where we would click 'Publish' up here, and then it's basically ready to go.\
\
[00:22:13.480] - Jessica\
Now I'm just going to go back out of here. We're going to press "Create Zap" again. Now the next step in my process, this is now done. When I create a new blog post in Notion, it automatically creates a Google Doc in a folder called 'Drafts.' Now, what I want to do is when I move that Google Doc to the folder called 'Final,' I want this to automatically create a draft post in WordPress so that I no longer have to copy and paste content into WordPress. So the trigger this time is Google Docs because that's where the action that I'm going to manually trigger actually happens. I'm going to say, "New document in folder" because I'm going to move that document to another folder. Whenever Zapier finds that I've added a new document into this Google folder that I'm going to select now, which is the 'Final' folder, because that's where I will move the document to. Whenever it finds a new document in the folder called 'Final,' it's going to test the trigger now. It won't find the document in there because at the moment the folder is empty, so I'm just going to skip the test. Then I wanted to perform an action and this action should take place in WordPress because that's where I go with my finished post and I wanted to create a post, "continue," I've already connected my WordPress account, if you haven't then you need to connect it. We're going to create a 'Post' and the 'Title' should be the title of the document. The 'Content' of the post in WordPress should be content of the actual document. The 'Excerpt' I haven't written, and I manually put that, the 'Author' is always going to be me. Then the 'Comment Status' for me is going to be open. The 'Format' is standard, it is non-sticky. 'Categories' and stuff I will set up later on and the 'Status' is going to be draft. "Okay, continue." Now we're going to test this specific step with the document that it's found before. Now if we navigate to 'Posts' over here in WordPress, I should find that here is the Google Doc that I have created, and it is basically already uploaded in WordPress as a draft.\
\
[00:25:02.350] - Jessica\
Now I think I'm going to be pretty much coming up on time. Just to save some time, I pre-prepared this. Our last step is whenever a new post is published in WordPress, I want to add that post to an Autolist in Metricall, which is how I regularly recycle my blog content on social media. The event in WordPress is 'New Post' and the trigger is whenever the 'Post Status' is changed to 'Publish' because that's when it's live on the website. Then we go over here and we select 'Add Post to Autolist' in Metricall, which is my social media scheduler and it's awesome. You have to select the brand. I have two in my account because I have two different brands, so I select my one. I select my list, which is creatively called 'My blog posts.' Then as the post content, I'm just going to put in the excerpt from the blog post itself. Actually, yeah, I should probably after "read the full post here" link. Then you could attach media, but when you put the link on Facebook, it'll automatically pull the featured image, so I don't really need to do anything about that. "Continue, test step." We'll send to Metricool and then go to Autolists over here and then on my blog posts \'97 Yep, here it is.\
\
[00:26:37.650] - Jessica\
Okay, so as we all know, many people attend trainings every single day and buy courses and whatnot, and then they do nothing. So, what I want you to do is develop your process, one that literally is smooth AF from start through to finish, document it, then open a Zapier account, play around and see what are the different tech tools that you're using and what options come up in the list in Zapier.\
\
[00:27:05.690] - Jessica\
Then I want you to set up your automations and I want you to test them carefully and then make sure that everything works as you would want it to work. And then I want you to set a date on the calendar in six months time where you are going to review your blogging processes again, because technological development happens at absolute record pace right now. And I want you to make sure that you're using a process that is literally the most efficient it could be right now. And for that, unfortunately, you're going to have to keep coming back and reiterate on your process.\
\
[00:27:39.400] - Jessica\
Now, what if you need more support? So, sometimes when we look at something, it seems like something we can do, and then four or five, six days later, we've sat down and we've started the process ourselves and we are completely stuck. In that case, I can help. So many of the things that might take you weeks to figure out, I already know how to do, and I can do and I'll do it in a couple of hours and it usually doesn't take me near as long as clients think that I'm going to take to finish it.\
\
[00:28:07.530] - Jessica\
I actually offer Tech VIP days as well as day rates for ongoing clients. I don't work on retainer anymore at all. I actually really don't like retainers. So, if ever you feel stuck, you feel overwhelmed, you have something that you want to set up just once, then reach out to me anytime because I might be able to do it in two hours, four hours, or if you're building a really big funnel, I might need a full day for it. You can always reach me via DM, and usually just searching my name, Jessica Dornieden will get you there, or you can check it out at jessicadornieden.com/tech-vip-day.\
\
[00:28:51.610] - Jessica\
So don't feel like you have to struggle with this alone. There are so many people who really don't like the tech and who've learned to use it just fine, and I know that you can too. That's really it from me with automations for blogging, and I hope that this was useful, and I wish you a lot, lot, lot more fun with all the other presentations yet to come. Bye.\

Hey, guys.\
\
[00:00:13.690] - Liz, Host\
I'm really excited for this session with Kayla. She has done something really fantastic that I feel like you don't see a lot of, is create a community of bloggers that support each other and work with each other. And I think that is something that's so underrated. It helps so much when you have blogging friends you can talk to and reach out to. So Kayla, welcome. I'm super excited to have you. Thanks for being here.\
\
[00:00:40.170] - Kayla\
Thank you so much, Liz, for inviting DBB and myself to your new blogging community.\
\
[00:00:46.950] - Liz, Host\
Sure.\
\
[00:00:50.050] - Kayla\
Okay.\
\
[00:00:50.840] - Liz, Host\
A couple of quick questions I'm going to ask, how long have you been blogging before you started this community of bloggers?\
\
[00:00:58.210] - Kayla\
I was blogging probably about two years before I started. So, altogether, I have been blogging for four years. I started off by blogging as a beauty type of influencer. All of my friends were kind of telling me like, oh, I love what you're doing with your makeup trends and certain skin cares and things like that. And so, instead of me always sharing or in that moment, what it is that I was using, I decided to create that blog and so, they can go back and see for reference all the time.\
\
[00:01:29.270] - Kayla\
And so, I did that myself. And then two years afterwards, I noticed that there was a need. And the need was that there was not any other blogging communities that were so warm and welcoming. And that really kind of catered to my niche. And the niche was the black blogger community. And I decided that would be something that's really cool and to start.\
\
[00:01:55.450] - Liz, Host\
So, how did you get started with it? I guess, would be the next question.\
\
[00:01:59.720] - Kayla\
Yeah. So, I went to a couple of blogger events in the Dallas area and really didn't notice. I just noticed there was, like a group of one table of, like, black bloggers and influencers. There were so many other people that were surrounded by us. But there was, like, one table all the time. And, of course, myself, I would just kind of gravitate towards that table because everyone wouldn't be so warm and welcoming. The other large bloggers and influencers who would be there. And of course, I want to take a picture with them and talk to them because I'm like, wow, I see you guys on the internet, but it wasn't, like, as warm and welcoming.\
\
[00:02:35.120] - Kayla\
And so when I would go over to the group, we would just like talk and get to know each other. And I was like, oh, this is cool. But really, the thing was when I came home, I'm like, well, how did I feel about that? Like why was there just one table? And I just started doing research on the Internet on Instagram. And I'm like, whoa, there's a lot of black bloggers or influencers in the Dallas community. We should showcase each other. And so that's really how it started.\
\
[00:03:01.430] - Kayla\
So, like that night after one event, I went home, did research and found, like, Dallas black bloggers was like, the hashtag was like, over and over and over again. And I decided to create kind of that community, and it's just been amazing since then.\
\
[00:03:17.050] - Liz, Host\
Sure. So, two follow up questions for that. First of all, how did you find those blogging events? Because I feel like there's a lot out there that people just don't know about. So, how did you find those?\
\
[00:03:26.120] - Kayla\
Definitely. So, I found out those through, like, eventbrite. I would just type in like blogger events in Dallas area, and I was able to locate that and also through Google search, which would be Dallas bloggers. I tried that and that was helpful to get in touch with a lot, get in touch and notice, like, a lot of other bloggers and influencers in the area.\
\
[00:03:51.130] - Liz, Host\
Okay. Once you decide to start the community, it's like, okay, I'm going to start this community. I'm in it. How did you get other people to get on board and be excited about it?\
\
[00:04:01.690] - Kayla\
You know, honestly, I can tell you the truth. I don't know. I think it's just more so about the willingness for people who just want to be a part of something and wanting to be a part of like.\
\
[00:04:14.170] - Liz, Host\
How did you get it out there that you were creating this community then so people would know.\
\
[00:04:18.380] - Kayla\
Yeah. So, a bunch of friends basically, just telling my friends, and then they're just spreading the word and it just kind of spread it all the way out in that area. So, yeah, basically just sharing with my friends and family on Instagram, through socials and through Facebook, you know.\
\
[00:04:38.590] - Liz, Host\
Yeah. Don't be afraid to put your blogging stuff out there in your personal feed. Even if people don't understand what you're doing, that's I feel like a strong thing because you talk to some of your family, they still know what you do.\
\
[00:04:51.880] - Kayla\
Yeah, they do.\
\
[00:04:55.030] - Liz, Host\
Okay. So, how has having this community helped, you helped the bloggers in it? What's sort of been the result other than you know having people to talk to.\
\
[00:05:05.590] - Kayla\
You know the result has kind of just fulfilled itself to be quite honest. But the main thing is that there's a real community amongst each other, there's real friends and be able to talk to. But they're making like strides for different partnerships. Like, oh, I see that you guys went to this location. Do you have the contact information for, like, so and so. And I'm like, of course, I'll share that with you. So, them branching out and doing stuff for themselves is like, one of the main things that I wanted to accomplish with this community because it's not just me.\
\
[00:05:40.020] - Kayla\
There's a ton of other bloggers in the community. So, I'm like, Yay go out, girl and do your thing. Another thing that I think is really cool is that well, I guess I said it already, which is they're really forming friendships amongst each other. Like, they're really hanging out and getting to know each other. And I feel like that's essential as well and really you know deserve some recognition because they would have never known that this mommy blogger and this mommy blogger are, like, really cool friends, and they can hang out and go do stuff mommy stuff together and create content together.\
\
[00:06:13.100] - Kayla\
So, stuff like that. That's why I've seen those type of things kind of just blossom into more.\
\
[00:06:20.050] - Liz, Host\
Yeah. Because when you're a blogger, it's easy to be feeling very alone with your computer and the people you live with, your spouse, your partner, your kid, whatever are like, why is she on the computer or he, and so being able to have other people that understand it and can support and help you? You know I feel like networking is kind of a dirty word sometimes, but community is really that's part of it. I think the first ever sponsorship deal I got was a friend was like, hey, I just did this deal with this company.\
\
[00:06:53.040] - Liz, Host\
I think you'd be a really good fit. Can I introduce you?\
\
[00:06:55.700] - Liz, Host\
Nice.\
\
[00:06:56.950] - Liz, Host\
You know it all comes back to people in relationships and being genuine. And so I love that you created this community, especially around a locality that you know I mean local communities are.\
\
[00:07:09.650] - Kayla\
Yes.\
\
[00:07:10.750] - Liz, Host\
Amazing. Because you built a community which is different from a mastermind, which I feel a lot of people think they need to be a part of. So, have you found that people in your community are forming masterminds? How do you differentiate between the two? So, it's not just, like, a constant, oh, we are coming here to work. Let's hang out type of thing.\
\
[00:07:35.650] - Kayla\
Just kind of letting it flow, right. Still keeping an agenda or maybe some certain topics for discussion, but kind of just letting it flow, letting each other introduce themselves and say, hey, my name. Is that's really important? Yeah. What do you mean by Mastermind? \
\
[00:07:55.070] - Liz, Host\
So, I know a lot of bloggers that will, like, two or three friends or something will form a monthly mastermind to work on their goals. And it's really strategy based. Like, yeah, the chitchat is like, hey, you're in the hot seat. What's your problem this month?\
\
[00:08:09.610] - Kayla\
Right.\
\
[00:08:10.160] - Liz, Host\
Let's kind of dig into that. And they all kind of mastermind around that person for that client.\
\
[00:08:14.890] - Kayla\
I like that idea. We haven't quite done that just yet. However, when we do have, like, branches and certain events, we still do talk about certain things that are occurring, something that may be, something that we.\
\
[00:08:26.040] - Liz, Host\
It's hard not to talk shop.\
\
[00:08:28.030] - Kayla\
It's hard. It's really hard not to talk about you know those things you know that matter to us or may affect us in the long run. So, yeah, we do have those type of topics, but for the most part, we just kind of keep it light and airy and fun.\
\
[00:08:41.310] - Kayla\
And just so, everyone can have the opportunity to speak, introduce themselves and just really getting to know each other. Sure.\
\
[00:08:47.430] - Liz, Host\
How often are you setting up meetings for your community.\
\
[00:08:51.790] - Kayla\
I started 2019 at the end of September 2019, so we were doing a lot of in person, right. Then penny happened, and it was a lot of monthly Zoom. Now that we started to get back out. It's more quarterly approach, but I'm thinking for maybe 2022 to definitely, maybe do monthly again, but still limited amount of people. But trying to do it more often, it seems like a big thing because the bloggers want that, the community wants more events for sure.\
\
[00:09:33.030] - Liz, Host\
Sure. How are you coordinating it? Like, how do you decide on the place and then just let everyone know how are you kind of coordinating and deciding how many people can attend, I mean especially these days where you do have to keep numbers in mind. How are you doing that?\
\
[00:09:48.940] - Kayla\
Yeah. So, definitely, the main thing is like talking to like the space, the venue space, the restaurant, whatever it is, seeing what it is that they need to, what it is first, and then kind of going out from there. But when I do announce it, I just announced it to the community as a whole. Just like, hey, you guys, we're going to be meeting up at, so and so, sign up here. And so, I usually don't release any type of certain information, like an address until after everyone has signed up. And then I'll share the information, because if not everyone would just come.\
\
[00:10:20.530] - Liz, Host\
True. Yeah.\
\
[00:10:22.150] - Kayla\
You know, and so, I just make sure that I do that. But yeah, that's what I do. I had everyone sign up if they're available.\
\
[00:10:30.810] - Liz, Host\
Okay. And do you try to do it like a different place each time?\
\
[00:10:35.170] - Kayla\
Yes. So, I try to do it all over the DFW Metroplex, so sometimes it will be in North Dallas, actual Dallas, De Belle, whatever. So, I try to do a different location and they're not even just restaurants. Sometimes we do coffee meetups just so we can hang out and chat and get to know each other. Or sometimes we have workshops in person. So, it's always different. Exactly.\
\
[00:10:57.850] - Liz, Host\
How do you decide between doing a workshop and just like a hangout meet up.\
\
[00:11:04.210] - Kayla\
So, yeah, so like, now, since it's about to be December, I mean, excuse me, January 2022, we are thinking about more. I think about more, so what's happening right then? Everyone wants to do vision boards. Everyone wants to get their goals out, the resolutions out for the new year. So, having a workshop like that, is kind of like our workshop based around current events is something that I like to do. Another thing is like, for like, Valentine's Day or for Valentine's Day. Sometimes I do Valentine's events, which is like a restaurant. So, we all get up dressed in our red and our pinks and our purples, and we go out to have brunch or something like that.\
\
[00:11:41.190] - Kayla\
So, it's really about like the trends and what's happening during that time. Sometimes for coffee meet up. I'm like, wow, it's been like six weeks, I haven't seen anyone. You guys want to have a coffee meetup, like and just ticket. So, it depends. But, yeah.\
\
[00:11:56.510] - Liz, Host\
So, it's not always something that's like, you don't have to have a huge, long thought out plan to make this happen.\
\
[00:12:04.090] - Kayla\
Oh, my gosh. No. The simpler, the better. And it feels much better for me as the founder, because I don't want to have to like, you know do all the extra things to make sure I'm planning accordingly. So, absolutely.\
\
[00:12:16.850] - Liz, Host\
Yeah.\
\
[00:12:17.300] - Kayla\
So.\
\
[00:12:17.550] - Liz, Host\
I mean, anyone who's wishing they had more of a community around where they are is totally doable. When you decide to do a workshop, is there anything you're doing specifically to like design it to make sure it's effective, I guess.\
\
[00:12:34.490] - Kayla\
Yeah. Sure. I mean, sometimes you know how, like, now everything is so digital. So, I make sure I keep something on campus for everyone to be able to go back. I know that sometimes I have some friends who are like, can you print out, like, a paper, so I can actually write and see? And so, we'll do stuff like that. But for the workshops, it's usually something that they take home. And I always try to give them an assignment at the end, like a call to action. Like, hey, go ahead and check out XYZ to see what it is that you like, whatever that topic was.\
\
[00:13:03.550] - Kayla\
The last one that I did was a workshop for email marketing, because I think that a few days before I had announced the workshop, Instagram had shut down. So, it was like, okay, so now you guys see why we need this email marketing workshop. And so, I you know walked them through MailChimp because I like MailChimp and so walk them through MailChimp altogether and just like, doing stuff like that and really just showing them you can do this, too. And not only that, it's not hard, you just have to sit down and do it.\
\
[00:13:46.130] - Liz, Host\
Yes. Yes. That's the thing is switching over from learning about it to actually getting it done.\
\
[00:13:52.530] - Kayla\
Right.\
\
[00:13:54.410] - Liz, Host\
I like that. So it's like, really kind of a last minute throw them together thing. So, you kind of take charge of this. You set this to me. Are you monetizing it in any way or is this really just setting, you know creating relationships, which is plenty of return.\
\
[00:14:13.830] - Kayla\
Yeah, so, within the last six months to a year, I have to have the opportunity to monetize off of the business. And the things will be, ways to monetize can be from, like, merchandise that I've had, Dallas Black Blogger, coffee mugs and T shirts and stuff like that. Also, I hosted, like, a conference that was really big conference. Also workshops and the events that I host, like, photo shoots and stuff like that. All those things I've had the opportunity to monetize off of within the last year.\
\
[00:14:57.970] - Liz, Host\
Okay. So, I like, all that because we've primarily talked about how you're kind of getting together. You're maybe learning something. You're getting coffee. But like, photo shoots and conference and merchandise. I love the idea. How did that come about? Did it require you to kind of put a lot of stuff up front? Was it really just sort of you made the money because it happened as opposed to having to put a lot of time and money up front for those things?\
\
[00:15:31.250] - Kayla\
You know what? To be honest, it varies her thing that you do for. Like, merchandise, you definitely put it the money upfront because it's got to be made. And then you got to ship it out based on if the consumer or the audience wants that product. Right. So, putting out the money first for those is what I've done and what I do. When it comes to events, I do put out money for events as well, maybe, like for the photographer and stuff like that. But you know you have to remember that you have to set a budget and not only that, you have to write out like your cost and what you want to charge per ticket, how many people you got to get real nerdy and accounting with it?\
\
[00:16:18.510] - Kayla\
You know what I mean? So that you can make sure that your time was worthwhile and that you may or may not be getting a profit back or what I like to do is at least break even you know get my money back. But you have to kind of like dig deep into that strategy, whatever.\
\
[00:16:40.000] - Liz, Host\
We have sessions on the numbers.\
\
[00:16:44.430] - Kayla\
yes.\
\
[00:16:44.720] - Liz, Host\
As much as we all wish we could just write and it all would come in. There's a lot more to it. There's a business side of, yeah, setting a budget and checking your revenue versus your cost and make sure there's a return on your investment and your time is compensated. It's not just about the money you're putting out, you're putting in time. And just like any job, you need to be compensated.\
\
[00:17:09.450] - Kayla\
Absolutely. Exactly. Exactly. And I say that I like to break even because it makes you feel like you're not losing anything, but for sure in this day and age in this time, we definitely want to make sure that we make a profit as well. But yeah, you guys make sure you check out those sessions.\
\
[00:17:27.250] - Liz, Host\
Yes. So, if someone wanted to kind of start a blogging community of their own where they're at, or you know what advice would you have for them?\
\
[00:17:38.950] - Kayla\
The main thing that I have, advice, I'm sorry that I have for them is basically you just have to be real and authentic and you have to be living doing in what it is that you're preaching. You have to be able to be living in that. I'm not saying you have to be a full time blogger, but I'm for sure saying that blog so that you can be an example, set an example for the person that you're going to be teaching, right. Not saying expert still, but definitely creating that example, showing that narrative, showing that initiative that you are what you say that you, are the next thing I want to say is have fun.\
\
[00:18:17.990] - Kayla\
You got to have fun. Because if you take stuff so serious and everyone else around you is going to take stuff serious. Don't want to just be so serious. So, have fun. Have fun for sure with your community you know, and then reach out to your community too. Hey, I have XYZ that I'm going to be presenting. Hey, I want to start a blogger community. Do you mind if you share with me? Like how do I create invoices, like, something so simple or something like that? You know what I mean?\
\
[00:18:47.480] - Kayla\
Ask your audience and engage with them as well. Yeah.\
\
[00:18:51.250] - Liz, Host\
Yeah, because it makes at least for me, it makes a world of difference to have blogging friends, whether they're local or not, just to be like, hey, how'd you been? Oh, my gosh. Can you> You know. I had a friend one time. I was like, hey, can you just check out my home page? I adjusted some stuff and there's this new post and she's like, I don't see it. Turns out my post like the last six weeks wasn't showing up. You know like how would I have known if I hadn't reached out and they're like, hey, can you, this looks weird to me, right?\
\
[00:19:22.920] - Liz, Host\
So, it's amazing. And sometimes it's just there's something that's bugging you that you just can't figure out, but it's so simple and you ask and they're like, oh, yeah, just do this and it takes them 5 seconds to explain it. And you know, that huge hurdle that you've been trying to overcome just gone.\
\
[00:19:40.540] - Kayla\
Gone. Okay. Where were you 6 hours ago when I was stressing?\
\
[00:19:44.560] - Liz, Host\
Yes. Okay. Is there any sort of tools or resources you use to help keep organized in terms of what you're doing with your community? Yeah.\
\
[00:19:57.870] - Kayla\
So, what main thing is that I love my PayPal account. PayPal for, like, all your invoices and contracts and stuff is really cool. The other thing I love is Later. Later is basically your scheduling, scheduler, yes, posting scheduler. So, you can connect your Facebook and your Instagram profiles to Later. And what you do is you create whatever that post may be. You put it on Later, get the caption and it sends it automatically to Instagram or Facebook for you. I love that. The other thing I like is, it's Later, Later, it's another one that I use to organize all of my things.\
\
[00:20:48.610] - Kayla\
It is called ClickUp. I'm recently addicted to click up for all my organization. I still keep a handy dandy notebook to write out all of my stuff because I'm a visual learner myself. However, that click up stays on my Internet Explorer all the time, so I reference it often, but those are my main four. So, my first one is PayPal. I love PayPal. The second one that I love is Later for automatic scheduling. The third one that I love is ClickUp for organization, and fourth is my handy dandy notebook.\
\
[00:21:32.530] - Liz, Host\
Sure. So, are you primarily communicating with your community via Instagram or Facebook?\
\
[00:21:41.390] - Kayla\
Yes. So, we do it through Facebook and Instagram through socials. And of course, emailing. Yeah, I tried to do a slack one time back in the day, but I don't know what happened to the slack. It wasn't as working as much.\
\
[00:21:58.840] - Liz, Host\
How to keep up with?\
\
[00:21:59.950] - Liz, Host\
Yeah, like, Slack, I feel like was a big thing, especially for online, like, four or five years ago. And it cracks me up when you know the pandemic hit. And a lot of people who work more nine to five jobs, all of them had to work from home, and we're looking at tools. They're like Slack. And I'm like, dude, that was like, four years ago. That's hard to keep up with.\
\
[00:22:20.180] - Kayla\
It's hard to keep up with. And not only that when you think about a sense of hand in mind how much people are literally on Instagram all day, on social, all day long. So, it's hard to get people off of Instagram to go to Slack. So, I'm just like, whatever you guys want.\
\
[00:22:39.210] - Liz, Host\
Yeah. Meet people where they're at.\
\
[00:22:41.590] - Kayla\
Exactly. You have to.\
\
[00:22:44.930] - Liz, Host\
If you guys want to learn more from Kayla, I know she, you can always subscribe to stuff on her blog. Do you want to throw out that URL and give some final words?\
\
[00:22:52.860] - Kayla\
Definitely. The URL is www.dallasblackbloggers.com or Instagram is also Dallas black bloggers, Facebook and Facebook.com/dallasblackbloggers. Be sure to follow the, join the group. Yeah. There's a lot of big things that I have coming up for 2022. Just more collaborations, more getting bloggers involved with collaborations as well. You know this community was built for the Dallas Black blogger. And so, now that the community has became DBB community, it's not just me. So, I need to make sure, and that's one of my goals too, enhance everybody to make everyone be like me.\
\
[00:23:46.800] - Kayla\
I want to come to your events too. I want to sit down at your event and eat your food and drink your liquor, too. I want to come see you in your form, and that's what I'm going to be doing as a place, doing that next year. I'm going to be placing bloggers into certain things so that I can come to their events as well. I don't want to be the one that's one at all. I want to come to their events. That's one of my main goals.\
\
[00:24:10.510] - Kayla\
And so, yeah, just make sure you guys follow us, check us out and thank you so much for this.\
\
[00:24:15.830] - Liz, Host\
Thank you. I appreciate you being part of this event and sharing your knowledge. I mean community is so important. It really is. Thank you again for sharing how people get started and ideas. I've got some ideas now, and I hope you have a good your day.\
\
[00:24:33.940] - Kayla\
Same for you. Thanks.\

All right, guys, I'm really excited for this presentation with Kayla from kaylasloan.com. She and I go back quite a ways. So, Kayla, thank you so much for being here.\
\
[00:00:07.720] - Kayla Sloan\
Well, thanks for\
\
[00:00:08.510] - Kayla\
Inviting me to be a participant, Liz. I'm really\
\
[00:00:10.550] - Kayla\
excited to join you.\
\
[00:00:12.500] - Liz\
Yeah, because, I mean, I met you years ago, and I've seen your business just skyrocket. Like you're doing well when I first met you, and now you're just like [inaudible 00:00:23]. \
\
[00:00:23.290] - Liz\
So, \
\
[00:00:24.720] - Liz\
thank you so much. Can you give everyone a little bit about your background and some of the highlights of what you're going to cover in the presentation?\
\
[00:00:31.090] - Kayla\
Absolutely,\
\
[00:00:32.400] - Kayla\
so, as Liz said, my name is Kayla Sloan, and I am the go to virtual assistant for the online personal finance space which is how I got my start in the online business world. And since then, I've actually graduated to teaching and coaching virtual assistants and also working with bloggers and business owners to help them set up systems so they can then fill them with highly trained and qualified virtual assistants from my training program.\
\
[00:00:58.090] - Liz\
Yeah.\
\
[00:00:58.490] - Kayla\
Excuse me. So I'll be talking a little bit in the presentation about how bloggers can take their blog from a hobby to a business by implementing systems that can be repeatable processes that they can then use virtual assistants to help them fulfill those duties.\
\
[00:01:12.240] - Liz\
Yeah, because I know when I started working with my virtual assistant it was -- and she actually had like assistant experience, and I did not really have experience working with an assistant. And so I was like, tell me what you need because I'm sure like this has been set up for me to do. And like, in my head, I know what I'm doing but I'm probably not doing a great job of explaining things to you. And whenever she's come back to me and it's not been like right on point, I'm like, well, I didn't do a good job explaining it. So, it's really always been my fault if something hasn't worked with my VA. But it is you get into these, you know, your zone and you're like, oh, it doesn't bother me that I just have to go find this or something.\
\
[00:01:52.170] - Kayla\
Right.\
\
[00:01:52.440] - Liz\
[crosstalk 00:01:52] but then you work to outsource, and then you end up just drowning in work.\
\
[00:01:57.420] - Kayla\
Exactly.\
\
[00:01:57.650] - Liz\
[crosstalk 00:01:57] So thank you for your presentation, you know, stuff I wish I had known -- and I'm still learning. And so, let's go ahead and get to it.\
\
[00:02:06.220] - Kayla\
Hello and welcome to today's presentation. I'm so glad that you're here with me today, and I'm really excited to share the five simple steps to follow so you can successfully onboard a virtual assistant without stress to help you run your blog and truly turn it into a business. So, let's go ahead and get started. Okay. So as far as what you can expect from today's presentation, we are going to go over the step-by-step process I teach business owners to help them find their perfect virtual assistant. Then we'll also talk about the steps you need to follow in order to make sure you are prepared to hire and onboard a virtual assistant with success. Plus, I'll also share a few tips to help you outsource without the stress. Okay. So just a couple more notes here before we get started. So first, it's worth saying that following these steps to prepare and then successfully hire and onboard a virtual assistant is super important so that you don't end up wasting your time or money on hiring the wrong person. So many business owners I work with have hired the wrong person in the past, and they walk away thinking that: A, they don't need or want a virtual assistant; B, that virtual assistants don't work out well for them or their business in particular; or C, they are afraid of hiring a virtual assistant because it did not go well the first time around.\
\
[00:03:26.740] - Kayla\
But the truth is virtual assistants can help business owners and bloggers, like you, no matter what niche you work in you just have to know how to make the best use of your virtual assistant, which is something we'll also talk about today. Next here, in order to make sure you get the most out of our time together today, take a couple of seconds to silence your phone, close out of Facebook and other social media, shut the kids out of the room you're in et cetera so you can really focus, take notes and take action to get started today. And the reason I say that is because action takers are the ones who see the best results. So definitely don't put off on taking action on things we talk about today. Okay. So you're probably here and you're in the right place if one of these things applies to you. So first, you're already feeling way too busy in your business. Maybe you feel like things are falling through the cracks and not getting done. Or maybe you feel like things are mostly getting done, but not to the best of their ability because you're always in a rush or feeling behind and like you're pulled in a thousand different directions because of all the things you have to do to keep your successful blog up and running.\
\
[00:04:32.660] - Kayla\
Or maybe your deadlines are constantly going past due. No matter what it looks like the bottom line is you need help and fast. Or maybe it's number two, which is that you finally understand that in order to truly grow your blog and treat it like the business it is or could become, you have to hire some help. So that means you're ready to let go of some of that control in your business in order to hire help and watch it grow. Or maybe number three applies to you, and that is that you already know that you want to hire help and you're ready to do it but you just want to make sure you go about it the first time the right way around.\
\
[00:05:11.480] - Kayla\
Okay. So\
\
[00:05:12.420] - Kayla\
with that -- now, you may not be in the right place if you're not willing to let go of some of the little things and daily tasks in your business, even though you know they're holding you back from the big things. You're also not in the right place if you don't have a budget at all or you're not willing to pay someone to help you grow your blog. Or maybe you don't even see your blog as a business. Finally, you may not be in the right place if you are a hot mess and you don't even know what needs to be done day to day to run and grow your blog. Although I will say that if that last one is you, we can still talk later because we can still help you get that figured out. Okay. So here is a quick overview of the five steps to successfully hire and onboard a virtual assistant. Now, don't worry, we will talk about each one of these individually, so you don't have to hurry to write them all down. This is just a quick overview of where we're going. So first, the first step is to prepare yourself.\
\
[00:06:08.660] - Kayla\
Second, you need to take some time to prepare your business before you hire a virtual assistant. Third, you'll need to create a detailed job description. Fourth, you'll need to gather applicants and then interview those people. Fifth, you'll be ready to onboard your virtual assistant with a trial period or a test project. And we'll talk more specifics about that when we get there. Now, let's go ahead and dive into each one of these individually. So the first step in getting ready to onboard a virtual assistant is to make sure that you are prepared to do so. You, as the CEO of your blogging business, need to make sure that you're ready to take things to the next level when you start building a team. This is really important because the majority of bloggers have either not had any management experience, for example, from a part-time time job or a full-time job they've had in the past. Or maybe they aren't used to managing someone virtually which can be a very different experience from managing someone in person. So here's how you can get prepared to hire and onboard a virtual assistant in your business. Now, there's just a couple of steps here to make sure that you are personally prepared to hire, but they're really important to ensure a successful outcome.\
\
[00:07:22.630] - Kayla\
So here's what you need to do. First, you need to figure out exactly what it is you need. So, what tasks could you take off your plate? What skills are you looking for in a virtual assistant? Also, make sure to ask yourself whether or not you need to have specific things done at certain times or on specific days, or if you can be a little bit more flexible. Now, if you don't know the answers to these questions off the top of your head, you need to take some time to do a time and task audit to figure out what is taking up so much of your time and if it's something that could be done by someone else. Aka, it doesn't necessarily have to be you doing everything in your business. There are certainly some things that you have to do yourself things that take your particular likeness, for example, if you're the face of your business. So if that's the case, you'll need to do things like videos, interviews, photos, things like that yourself. But there are also plenty of things you don't have to do yourself, even if you are the face of your business. That can be things like writing blog posts, writing social media posts, responding to the majority of emails that come into your overflowing inbox, interacting on social media, creating blog post images, et cetera.\
\
[00:08:34.810] - Kayla\
All of those things are things done behind the scenes that can be done by someone else. Now, the bonus perk of doing a time and task audit is that you'll figure out exactly how long it takes you to do some of these things. So, if you end up outsourcing them, you should know about how long they'll take your virtual assistant and about how much it'll cost you if your virtual assistant charges hourly. Now, the second thing you need to do to get prepared to hire a virtual assistant is to make sure that you're aware of and know your own personality. So, for example, are you laid back or do you tend to micromanage things in your business? Or are you really friendly and outgoing? Or do you prefer not to be bothered when you're working? These personality traits will also affect who you'll want to work with in your business and who could be the best fit for you personally. Now, the third piece here is that you need to learn to let go and that can be easier said than done, for sure. But now is the time to prepare the expectation that you'll have to let go of some control and a part of your business in order to onboard a virtual assistant.\
\
[00:09:40.270] - Kayla\
Realize that the virtual assistant will have to do some things that you don't have the time and energy to do, but that they may not or probably won't do them the exact same way that you will. Unless you have an extremely detailed written out process, but even then, your virtual assistant may do things slightly differently than you would have done them yourself, and you have to be okay with that. Now, the truth is you can still demand very high-quality work and recognize that even then it may still be done slightly differently than you would have done it. It also comes back to that old saying that done is better than perfect. So, you have to recognize and know that that's going to have to be okay as you get ready to outsource and hire a virtual assistant. Okay. So time to take action here on this first step. So again, first, if you don't know what to outsource or you don't know the answer to the questions we talked about earlier, it's important to do a time audit to see what is taking up the biggest chunk of your time. After you see what's taking up all of your time, the second thing you need to do is to decide what you want to outsource first.\
\
[00:10:45.810] - Kayla\
Now, I will also say that that doesn't mean that you can't outsource some more of those things from your time audit later. Just go ahead and get started with one biggest headache or biggest pain point first after you do your time audit. Okay. So, after you're done getting yourself ready to hire a virtual assistant, now it's time to take a look at your blog to make sure everything is ready on that front as well. So first, if you don't already think of your blog as a business, you'll need to make sure that you tackle that mindset hurdle. If you don't, you may not feel ready to invest in hiring someone to help you grow your blog. You have to be ready to truly treat it like a business and see yourself as the CEO steering the ship in order to successfully onboard a virtual assistant. Okay. So, I will say that these things here are usually the things that bloggers and business owners skip over or decide is not all that important. But the truth is that these things are actually crucial to successfully hiring and onboarding a virtual assistant and making sure that they have their best chance of success with you as their client.\
\
[00:11:50.960] - Kayla\
Without this, hiring a Virtual Assistant may actually end up feeling like you have more work to do and more things to manage rather than taking things off your plate which is how it's supposed to feel, at least in the long term, after your virtual assistant is fully trained on your specific business processes. Okay. So, the first thing you need to do to prepare your blog is to make sure that you have processes created for all of your to-do's and tasks in your business. So, if you don't already have that, here's what you need to do. First, go ahead and write down everything you do and the steps that you have to take to do it. This is how you create processes for things in your blog. For example, how specifically do you write blog posts? How specifically do you get them published on your website? Write down step by step every single thing you have to do to publish -- to create and publish a blog post, for example. If you're hiring a brand new virtual assistant or if you have tasks that are highly skilled or important or highly detailed, I also highly suggest that you record a video of yourself completing them.\
\
[00:12:57.200] - Kayla\
And you can do that with a free resource like Loom. It's also going to be really important that you keep these written processes or videos up to date on a regular basis because we know things are constantly changing like social media algorithms. And maybe even something like your blog post publishing process may change after a significant Google algorithm update if your focus is on SEO rather than social. Keeping these things up to date doesn't have to be a giant chore either because it may be something that your virtual assistant can update on a semi-regular basis as those things change over time. Now, the second thing to do to prepare your business to hire a virtual assistant is to make sure that you have a project management system of some kind, and this is going to be really important. So first, get a system that you and your future virtual assistant can use to complete tasks on time. I personally use Asana, but there are plenty of other tools out there as well, such as Trello, Monday, ClickUp, and more. Now, these systems are going to be key to helping you track projects, deadlines, and all the moving pieces of each.\
\
[00:14:01.070] - Kayla\
And now that it's not just you doing things in your business, you need a system of organization so you can easily see what's being done by who and when. It'll also help you in case there are ever mistakes made or things that are forgotten and not done because it allows you to track these things and make improvements more easily, and you can also go back and see a history of tasks within your project management system. It also helps to greatly improve communication on your team, which brings me to this third one here, which is to get a communication system. Now, if you have an all-in-one project management system, you can definitely use that for communications as well. For example, my team mostly communicates via Asana comments and task descriptions. But you could also communicate with your virtual assistant via email, Slack, Voxer, or other options as well. My team, for example, does use Voxer for quick or urgent communications from time to time. Now, of course, deciding what is urgent or not is a whole other conversation for another time. Okay. So now it's time to take action here. So here are those three simple steps to prepare your business for a new virtual assistant.\
\
[00:15:08.840] - Kayla\
So first, you're going to want to create systems and processes if you haven't already. Those can be written, they can be created with videos, whatever makes the most sense for you, but go ahead and get those created ASAP. Second, you're going to want to set up that project management system, something like Asana, so that you can keep track of everything. And then third, set up a communication system for your team as well, if needed. Okay. So after you get everything set up from step number two, now it's time to create that perfect job description for your virtual assistant. Since you've already spent some time figuring out what you want to outsource, and maybe you even did a time and task audit, this first step should be pretty easy to do. So you're actually going to sit down, outline skills, possible tasks, how you plan to communicate, any certifications needed and whether or not your virtual assistant will need to know how to use your projects' management system or other tools, including your website's backend. For example, if your blog is on WordPress, then you'll need to list that in the job description as well. You'll want to be as detailed as possible to avoid getting applications that are not the right fit.\
\
[00:16:16.470] - Kayla\
So it's important to take some time here to make sure you outline everything you want them to do and all of the knowledge that you would require or at least prefer. The second thing you need to include in your job description is the pay, plus the hours or the scope of the project. So you want to list what you're willing to pay and the hours you'll offer, or if you're paying a set monthly fee or another project per project fee. This is important to help weed out virtual assistants who may have higher rates than your budget or don't have as much time as you require. Now, if you need availability at specific times of day or in a specific time zone or something like that, you'll want to specify that as well to make sure it's not a deal breaker for the virtual assistant you are hiring. Now, the third thing you need to do is to make sure that you offer your contact information as well as the best way for them to fill out the application and whether or not it's okay to contact you before you've made your hiring decision. As a special little bonus tip here, I always recommend that you add kind of a silly or menial requirement for applicants.\
\
[00:17:18.610] - Kayla\
This could be something like using a specific subject line when they email their application or pitch, or maybe you ask them to tell you their favorite color or favorite food as a PS on their email application. And the reason I say to do that is because this is something that just helps ensure that candidates are being thorough, detail oriented, and that they read your job description thoroughly as well. It'll also ensure that they have to make customizations to their application versus just copying and pasting and sending it off for over 100 virtual assistant openings they found online. Okay. So it's time to take action. So here is where you need to go ahead and take some time to sit down and create your job description. Second, you'll need to create an application form via a tool like Google Forms or Typeform or something like that to collect applications. If you don't want to collect applications on a form and instead you want people to just email you, make sure you set up a label or any special inbox or something like that to help you weed through those applications. And then finally, you need to go ahead and promote that opening with your social media channels through email marketing to your list, on your blog, et cetera,\
\
[00:18:27.210] - Kayla\
so you can start collecting applications and then go ahead and just let those roll on in until the deadline that you've decided to set. Okay. So after you've gotten at least a few applications, now it's time to do interviews. Now, interviews may feel like a hassle, or maybe they feel like a thing of the past, and you may be tempted to skip them and decide who to hire based just on their email or application, but I will say that this would be a mistake because part of hiring the right candidate is making sure that they are a fit overall, not that they just look good on paper. Okay. So here is more information about how to interview and get to know the applicants who have applied for your virtual assistant job. So the first thing you need to do is to make sure that you personally interview your top applicants. Now, I will stress that you should not wait until you are beyond your limit to get ready to hire someone because you won't want to go through this entire interviewing and hiring process when you're already stressed out. So, it's important that you take your time and interview the top three to six applicants that seem like the best fit for you.\
\
[00:19:34.260] - Kayla\
And you should do these interviews personally, not have someone else do that for you. Now, these interviews don't have to be super long. They can be 30 minutes or less each for an interview. But doing these personally will help you to make sure that the virtual assistants who are applying are a good fit for you. Now, the second piece here during the interview process is that you want to make sure that you actually get to know these candidates. Because you don't want to clash with your future virtual assistant, it's important to make sure that their personality and goals fit in with yours. After all, they'll be helping you in your business, so you definitely want to make sure that you get along. So take a few minutes of that 30-minute interview to get to know them on a more personal level by talking about more than just business. Okay. So, now, your action steps include reviewing the applications and narrowing them down to the top three to six applicants. I would suggest that you look closely for a virtual assistant who is detail-oriented, a good communicator and leaves thorough and thoughtful responses to your application questions.\
\
[00:20:35.730] - Kayla\
Then go ahead and set up interviews with each of those top candidates, and definitely take notes during each interview so you can review them all afterwards when making a decision, which brings us to step number five. After the interviews, it's definitely time to make a decision and hire someone, at least for a test project or trial period to start with. In fact, sometimes business owners I've worked with will actually hire the top two candidates for a test project or a trial period to see which ends up performing better and/or fitting in better with the business, and that's okay. Just make sure you plan in your budget so you can pay for the test project or trial period for both virtual assistant candidates because you should never ask an applicant to do unpaid work. Okay. So the actual onboarding process after you've gone through interviews is actually pretty simple. So, the first thing you need to do is to either create a contract or sign a contract from your virtual assistant. Most virtual assistants will actually have their own contracts that they can provide to you, but you may want to have them sign one of yours if you have one.\
\
[00:21:42.710] - Kayla\
If they have the contract and provide it to you, make sure that you read all of the details before you sign on the dotted line. If you have questions, it may even be worth having a lawyer read over the contract before you sign it. To make things as easy as possible, you can use an electronic signing service like DocuSign or HelloSign to sign a contract. The next step in onboarding your virtual assistant is to make sure that you create shared folders. So for any work that needs to be uploaded and shared with each other or sent to each other, you'll need to have some shared folders in place such as in Google Drive or Dropbox or something like that. Or you need to be using a project management system that allows uploading and storage capabilities such as Asana. And this is something that will help you keep everything organized. And you'll want to make sure that using these means that you'll own everything that is created for your business. So basically, all intellectual property that is created on behalf of your business should be owned by you, and that should also be spelled out in the contract with your virtual assistant as well.\
\
[00:22:44.680] - Kayla\
That way you don't have to replace everything or create it from scratch if your virtual assistant doesn't work out in the long term. Now, the next thing you need to do is to create an email or a contact address for your virtual assistant. This is going to be especially important if your virtual assistant will be conducting business on your behalf, sending emails, reaching out to people, things like that. So you can go ahead and just create a team email address for your virtual assistant, or you can actually create an email address with their specific name followed by your businessname.com. Now, you can also use this email address to add your virtual assistant to shared folders and the project management system so they aren't using their personal email address or account to access your secure information. You can also use the email you create to share passwords and login information with your virtual assistant through a tool like LastPass. Now, the next thing to do is to train your virtual assistant. So, once you've hired your virtual assistant, you definitely need to have them go through the training videos or tasks or written procedures that you've created and have them go through those as a trial.\
\
[00:23:51.000] - Kayla\
You can set up a trial month to give them time to get their footing and figure out how you like things done. And ultimately to help you guys decide if it's a fit for both of you. It's just as important that you're a good fit for the virtual assistant as it is that the virtual assistant is a good fit for you. And then this last piece here is to make sure you check in often, but definitely don't micromanage. So you may decide that you want to have weekly team meetings or a quick text check in every morning to make sure everything is running smoothly and if your virtual assistant has questions for you. In the beginning, while working with your virtual assistant during a test or trial period, you'll want to touch base more often until they get comfortable with their role. Even though you're busy, you need to make sure that you make time and space for communication with your virtual assistant if you want them to be successful. As far as action steps besides what we just talked about, you should go ahead and assign your virtual assistant a test project or specify the length of the trial period.\
\
[00:24:47.210] - Kayla\
If doing a trial period, the dates of the trial should be spelled out in the contract that you've both signed. You also need to go ahead and schedule a check-in meeting for the end of the trial period or at the end of the test project to decide if you want to move forward with hiring or retaining the virtual assistant over the long term. And then finally, the last thing you need to do is to make sure you schedule weekly or regular check-ins throughout the test or trial to be able to communicate clearly with your virtual assistant. Okay. So as we wrap things up here, I have a couple of questions for you. So first, are you ready to stop overworking yourself and experiencing burnout? Are you ready to stop holding your blog back from being the successful business it truly could be? And are you ready to go from a one-person shop to truly being the CEO of your blogging business?

**Transcript:**\
[00:00:00.260] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
All right, guys, thank you so much for joining us. We've got Kelsey Silver here with a decade of experience as a licensed therapist, corporate consultant, and MIT-trained analyst, Kelsey is on a mission to support neurodivergent entrepreneurs in scaling their business even on low spoon days with strategies that work with their brain, not against it, through her company, The Neurospicy CEO. I love that name. Kelsey shares simple strategies to help neurodivergent entrepreneurs achieve success by embracing a business strategy that honors their neurodivergence and bankrolls their life. Kelsey, welcome. Thank you so much for coming.\
\
[00:00:45.660] - Kelsey Silver\
Thank you so much for having me. I'm so excited for this conversation.\
\
[00:00:48.280] - Liz\
I am, because we're going to be talking about creating a simple, sustainable foundation for your business, which I love. And I was digging through Instagram and stuff, and I was like, "I needed this like six years ago." I was like, "It's me."\
\
[00:01:06.230] - Kelsey\
Oh, I've heard that. I'm like, "That's my brain."\
\
[00:01:13.010] - Liz\
First, why don't you go ahead and define what you mean by neurospicy, and how it exhibits itself? Let's start there.\
\
[00:01:20.810] - Kelsey\
Yeah, absolutely. So neurodivergent is a term that was actually coined back in the '80s, and it literally means anything that any brain patterns that diverge from the norm. So it covers a really wide umbrella that we don't tend to think about. So you think neurodivergent? "Oh, that's ADHD and autism." It's also bipolar, PTSD, childhood trauma, schizophrenia. It actually covers this really wide breadth of people that think differently than what's considered the norm. And so it's always really rewarding when people are like, "But I don't have ADHD, but that's my brain." And when I hear that, because it's true, it's simply that your brain thinks differently than what society has always told you you were supposed to think. You process sensory input differently. You solve problems differently. And what's really cool is that neurodivergent individuals are three times more likely to become entrepreneurs. So we're seriously overrepresented in a really great way within the entrepreneur community, but a lot of the stuff out there is by neurotypical people that don't really have strategies that work with the way our brains work. So that's where I come in.\
\
[00:02:38.230] - Liz\
Yes. But let's talk about how if maybe you didn't realize you were neurodivergent, there's a lot of things out there. Some ways it may come out in business that might surprise people and be able to recognize, "Oh, hey, yeah, that's right."\
\
[00:02:55.960] - Kelsey\
The most common is, do you consider yourself multi-passionate? That's like top one, right? A lot of the clients I've worked with that identified themselves as multi-passionate did, in fact, find a root in their neurodivergence. A lot of other ways that it might present itself are in shiny object syndrome, meaning that you really like to dive into different tools or have a bunch of different methods. So not necessarily multi-passionate in the sense of many different types of businesses, but you skip around a lot in your business. And a lot of times the really tangible way it manifests in business is, I grew up in Louisiana. So you know those houses that are built on stilt? When your business looks like that. You've got this really beautiful, beautiful second and third floor. But that first floor, that foundation of your business is on stilts and it's like... That business structure is usually the result of someone who's neurodivergent not really being able to set up that foundation that's supportive of this really beautiful house.\
\
[00:04:13.720] - Liz\
Yes. But just because you may have started that way doesn't mean you can't go back and fix it, which I have done a lot in my business. I was like, Oh, I'd be so much further if I didn't have to keep going back and fixing things. But it really helps long term that I do. So let's talk about what that foundation should look like and how to approach it when you're neurodivergent.\
\
[00:04:39.790] - Kelsey\
Yeah, absolutely. So the first word, I mean, it's like in everything I do is simple. And that goes for neurotypical people, too. This is not solely for neurodivergent people. When you have something that is simple and standardized as your basis, as your foundation, you can keep returning back to it because you know what that structure is. And for neurodivergent people, simple also needs to be flexible. We talked a little bit about those low spoon days, right? That's in my intro. And it's because for neurodivergent people, if you know Spoon Theory or not, our energy levels fluctuate, a lot, and so does everyone's. But honoring, having a foundation in your business that honors when that energy fluctuates is essential. Because if you're forcing yourself to fit into this tiny little box of a structure that's "Well, but it's standard. I must comply", it's going to fail.\
\
[00:05:47.280] - Liz\
I think one of the hardest lessons, it took me a few years to learn, is that sometimes, especially as an entrepreneur because it comes to you, rest is the most productive thing you can do, because it'll take you five times longer if you try to push through it. Whereas if you just go lay down for 30 minutes, rest is the most productive thing you can do sometimes. Sometimes you have to. Sometimes you're on deadline. It happens, but generally speaking, rest can be productive. I think a lot of people forget that, especially, I mean, just the way our society is built, not to get all into that. But yeah. Can you maybe talk about a real world example of something foundational that would be simple yet flexible?\
\
[00:06:31.170] - Kelsey\
Yeah. What are you tracking? Okay? So having a way to track the important numbers in your business, but in a way that isn't constantly looking at your numbers, constantly festering over them, constantly wondering what you want to do, is a really great foundation. So there's four numbers that I always suggest we look at, and that is how many leads you have, what are your products, what's your conversion rate, and what's your revenue. Now, there's plenty more. I'm a data analyst at heart, so there's a thousand things that I could look at. But having those four things lets you see what the health, it has your health check of your business, right? And you can, by tracking those numbers, you can do it at whatever cadence works for you. If you're having a really low day, you're at a low energy place, you're at a low mental health place, don't look at your numbers. Just don't. Look at them next week because these numbers aren't things that you necessarily need to look at every morning. But if you are that kind of person every morning you can sit down at your desk and look at those numbers. But so you're setting up a foundation that can be done at a cadence that works with your energy level, with your mental health, with where you're at in your place. So you're honoring yourself while still making sure that you're looking at things in a way that's going to drive your revenue forward, that's going to make sure that your business is sustainable.\
\
[00:08:06.520] - Liz\
Yes, and for just blogging context, because I feel like when you use leads, it's more seen in the context of if you're offering services, we're going to say email list, like growth, like your audience growth. And I would say email list over followers on social media because you don't own a social media platform. You don't own your Instagram, they could shut you down tomorrow. But your email list is an asset in your business you own. I'm going to interject that.\
\
[00:08:32.040] - Kelsey\
And to hone in on that a little bit more because that's a really important point, leads might be two or three different numbers. So it might be page views in addition to email, or page views might be your leads, and you look at the email in under your conversion rate. That's fine, too. It's really, that's the flexibility of the model is as long as you know and you've defined what those four numbers are for you and what's meaningful for your business and your brain, that's where the flexibility piece comes in.\
\
[00:09:07.000] - Liz\
Yes. Make sure you're having some data dates is what I like to call them. OK, so you mentioned tech being a focus for business owners, right? Because there's always the, "Oh, this is the magic tech wand that's going to fix all my problems and make me super rich and sell all my things." And there's always new tech. So it's a hard thing to learn to pull back from. I may or may not have had to recover from an AppSumo addiction.\
\
[00:09:42.790] - Kelsey\
I was just going to ask if you were a recovering AppSumo addict. I knew it. I had you pegged.\
\
[00:09:48.590] - Liz\
You did, you did. Now if there's something that I'm like, okay, but this could apply, I actually bounce it off my sister who worked as my VA for a little while, she doesn't anymore, but she knows enough about my business, where I'm like, "Am I allowed to buy this?" Because I need that outside perspective, because otherwise I will just... So let's chat about the tech and the ways it can support you, but also in the ways it can detract from what you're doing.\
\
[00:10:17.280] - Kelsey\
Yeah. So I have a model within my business. I use it with my private clients and also my group program. I call it The Fellowship Mess that I'm a huge Lord of the Rings nerd. My daughter is named after an individual in Lord of the Rings. It's just my life. It is what it is. I call it The Fellowship Model, and it's tech, team, and talent. And so tech plays a huge role in the structure of your business. But there's some really important parameters around that technology, as you've mentioned. First and foremost, we're talking about flexibility. I tell all my clients, you've got to work in a neurospicy tax. There is a portion of your budget that is for things that costed money because you are spicy. That's just having a part of your budget, first of all, that you acknowledge is going to be, "I bought a thing on AppSumo that I probably shouldn't have bought." And so it gives you grace to play without feeling guilt and detriment and all that. It's a small portion, but it's there. And so there's this little neurospicy tax that I always say. On top of that, though, I really encourage people to look at what is the resource investment? Not the money investment. That's a whole other conversation. What is your resource investment in playing with this new technology? ChatGPT, free version. Resource investment, mostly it's going to be time playing with it. What are you willing to invest in playing with it? Are you willing to invest money in these people that have all of these prompt workbooks? Maybe, maybe not. If you're not willing to invest in those, are you going to invest? So it's all about resource management and allowing yourself to be flexible with what that is. The same goes for, for example, I use a technology called Use Motion, and it's a productivity tool. It lets me schedule everything. It's my God send. But it was a higher monetary investment. The resources were monetary. Took very little time to set up, but I got resources back because the AI tells me what's my highest priority next to-do task and plugs it into the space in my calendar that's available. I was able to balance the monetary resource requirement and the time to set it up with how much resources I'd get back. And so it's really, for me, my brain works really well in numbers. That's where my data analyst comes in. I literally have a chart that's like, what's it going to cost in terms of a scale of one to 10? What am I going to get back scale of one to 10? What am I going to invest in it one to 10? And I score it out. I'm like, "You know what? That actually it either evens out or I'm going to get stuff back from it. Cool. I'm going to go for it." So it's the pattern of analyzing when I go to purchase this thing or when I go to play with this thing, because free tools are always the worst. What am I investing and what am I going to get back in return?\
\
[00:13:29.810] - Liz\
Yes, I like that. Okay, so as far as making sure you've got a strong foundation, we've talked about simplicity, flexibility, and particular numbers to track, tech. What are some other elements of having a simple yet strong foundation for your business?\
\
[00:13:47.280] - Kelsey\
Yeah, it's the actual strategy.\
\
[00:13:50.890] - Liz\
Okay.\
\
[00:13:52.310] - Kelsey\
The foundation for your business, so you've got what to track is that the what you can track can only make sense if you know what your goal is. Having a simplified strategy is going to give you the room and flexibility to build on it. If you're just starting in business, you said when we first started talking, you said, "Oh, my gosh, this is me like six years ago." If you're just starting in business, picking one-to-one, what is your one strategy for getting people onto your email list, if we use that example? Is it always making sure that there is a form at the bottom of each article? Is it embedding links in your article? If you try to do all the things, you're going to forget one. Your audience is going to expect one thing and get the other that time. So what is the one thing? Now you can do other things. There's the flexibility in, "Oh, I want to do this this time." As long as you still always do the first one. So what is your initial legion? Once you have people on your email list, the thing you own, what is your next point of contact with them? What is the next right step that they can take? And I really like that phrase. I repeat it a lot is, "What's the next right step?" I think it's from frozen, if I'm being honest.\
\
[00:15:26.710] - Liz\
The next right thing. I was totally just thinking that, so I guess.\
\
[00:15:29.820] - Kelsey\
I have a two year old, so I'm allowed.\
\
[00:15:32.060] - Liz\
Yeah, my niece and nephew, we listen to a lot of Frozen. Yeah, not as much these days, but yeah.\
\
[00:15:38.900] - Kelsey\
So yeah. So what's the next right thing? What's the next right step? And so if you plan out from the moment someone meets you to the moment they become a paying customer, because we're in this for monetary (either through ad clicks or through actual paying for services) we're in this to create a sustainable business monetarily. If you plan out those touch points, but picking one for each touch point, then you can start to expand upon it. And that's what I mean by, okay, so we have our foundation. We have all of our little stilts. Now we're putting up the walls. We're boxing ourselves in while still having windows open, still having doors open. We can still let the air breathe. We can still let things come through. We can still allow our creativity, but we have the safety of some walls and parameters where if we are at a low energy day or we're not quite sure what the next right thing is, we know what it should be. It doesn't have to be, but we know what it can be, what it should be. And so it's about creating those structures and those scaffoldings in place so that when we don't have... When we're just not in the decision making process, when you're sitting in front of the stove and you're like, "What the heck am I going to cook today?" You have your list of recipes that are go-to. Same applies to your business. You have your one or two things that you know you can always go to when you just don't know what the next thing is.\
\
[00:17:13.120] - Liz\
Okay, I like that. I did want to hone in a little bit more because you're talking about having a clear strategy. But one thing I know I've struggled with in the past is, yeah, I'll have a clear strategy, and then I don't know where I put it, or I don't reference it, or I don't... You know, do you have any suggestions in terms of where to house that strategy and make sure it's what you're going? It's your playbook that you're going back to?\
\
[00:17:42.050] - Kelsey\
Yeah. So I'm a big SOP nerd, like a standard operating procedure nerd. So I have templates out the wazoo for my SOPs. And it's how do I make a decision about adding a new legion? But that doesn't work for everybody. So making the decision as to where your hub is, that's where your decision matrix is. And so for some people, that's Notion. For some people, that's ClickUp. I do not recommend an analog notebook, but some people need it. But knowing that every time you go to make a decision that is central to your business, so large purchase, new hire, new product, those sorts of decisions that are going to have a true impact on your actual business trajectory, you go back to that single document where you've outlined this strategy. And I tend to do it by actual timeline. What I recommend with my clients is map it out. Neurodivergent individuals typically can be very visual or on the other extreme, very\'85 They need a flow chart diagram, that's me. That's the spicy that I fit into. Or they can't have that level of sensory input and they need something that is much more bulleted. Pick the one that works for you, have it in a single place and revisit it at minimum quarterly and then definitely monthly. And so by revisiting it, you're creating these kinesthetic triggers in your brain of, "This is the right place. This is what will show me that next right step. This is that guiding star." I even say connect those things that we measure to that strategy. And when you're doing your data dates, as you phrase them, reference it in accordance with that strategy. And so you're building this pathway in your brain of, "When I do this, I look here. When I do this, I look in that same spot. When I make this decision, I look in that same spot." And it's about training your brain to keep going back to that one place. And if you are really drawn to move it somewhere else, everything has to shift to that one place. You have to acknowledge that you're going to have to rebuild those kinesthetic triggers.\
\
[00:20:15.040] - Liz\
And again, that's looking at what's the investment in your time. It's not investment. Oh, it doesn't always mean money. I mean, time is money. Time you can't get back. You can earn more money.\
\
[00:20:24.980] - Kelsey\
Exactly. And I always... So I had a client who was like, I'm going to move my entire Notion to ClickUp. "Uh-huh. How long?"\
\
[00:20:34.020] - Liz\
I mean I love ClickUp, but yeah.\
\
[00:20:35.420] - Kelsey\
"How long is that going to take you?" "Okay." We had the conversation now for her, ClickUp, it had the resources she needed. Her team was going to be able to use it a lot better than Notion. That panned out.\
\
[00:20:47.840] - Liz\
It was worth it.\
\
[00:20:48.430] - Kelsey\
We, in fact, did move over to ClickUp. As you say, you love ClickUp. There are huge advantages. But it was a whole decision making process to get to that place. And her whole strategy shifted around ClickUp.\
\
[00:21:02.030] - Liz\
Yeah. I will say like... I want two comments I have there. One is that when I decided I was going to double down on ClickUp and really get into it, and I have some things I need to fix in it. With the way I have it set up, I realize it's not working. It's creating bottlenecks. I need to fix some things. But I signed up for a membership that taught me how to do it so that I could figure... I wasn't just being my head against the wall so that I had some expertise leading me. So take the time to learn the thing you're committing to. It makes a big difference. And the other thing I wanted to say was that whatever you choose, there's no one right tool. You just got to figure out what works for you and recognize that it might be a combination of tools sometimes. It just really varies in what you're going to do day to day. What can you commit to day to day? So ClickUp, I know I need to fix things in it, but I go in each day and I look at my home, which has my list of tasks do that day. So that is useful to me. It gives me a place to go back to, like you said, and some place to start.\
\
[00:22:20.340] - Kelsey\
Well, and it can be different. Your day to day can reside in a place that's different than your strategy. That sometimes people need to... I know for myself, my strategy resides in Miro, which is this very visual graphic user interface place that's like, I can really see this beautiful plan because it's inspirational to me, so I like to look at it, it's pretty, and it works with the way that I need to visualize it. I couldn't produce something like that in Notion or in ClickUp in a way that triggers my brain to be interested in it. But I have built the pathway in my brain to know that that is still where I go. So even though it resides in a different place, and in my day to day I use AirTable a lot. In my day to day, I live in AirTable and in Use Motion. Those are the two places I live. I still know I'm always going to go back to Miro to look at my strategy. So it's okay to be several tools. As long as first you've done the work to learn the tool and make sure that you're actually maximizing it. And second, you have to have a one to one ratio for the type of task to the product. So every task can only have one place to do the work. So it's okay if each kind of task has a different place, as long as you're always doing that same kind of thing in the same place, because otherwise it's going to end up... I always use the analogy of the Hoarders House of Google Drive.\
\
[00:24:02.690] - Liz\
I feel a little attacked by that. I'm not going to lie.\
\
[00:24:05.470] - Kelsey\
I'm sorry. I honor you. I empathize.\
\
[00:24:08.490] - Liz\
It's okay. I'm working on it. I'm building out my SOPs. I'm getting better at my naming conventions. It's a process.\
\
[00:24:15.600] - Kelsey\
But it is. It's a huge process.\
\
[00:24:18.480] - Liz\
Yeah. Especially, I've been in business for almost 10 years, so I've got a lot of back stuff and some stuff I'm just not going to get to. And that's okay. It's moving forward, getting it right.\
\
[00:24:30.710] - Kelsey\
And that's where it's fun to just make an archive folder and shove everything in.\
\
[00:24:34.680] - Liz\
I just call it old, and I'm like...\
\
[00:24:37.180] - Kelsey\
I put a Z in front of it, Zold. Because then it goes to the very bottom, I don't look at it.\
\
[00:24:43.030] - Liz\
There you go, yeah, yeah. But it's fun. Sometimes you dig in there and you're like, Oh, that was actually pretty good.\
\
[00:24:48.930] - Kelsey\
We're going to resurrect that. Yeah, exactly.\
\
[00:24:51.440] - Liz\
And then the other thing I would say in terms of... We talked about the resource and the cost of implementing something, but you can systemize and automate a lot of things, like a lot of things. You throw Zapier in there, you throw in automations for whatever tool you use. I use ClickUp, you use Airtable. It's insane, but same thing still applies. So I'm like if... Because building out those automations can be so tedious.\
\
[00:25:17.150] - Kelsey\
I say I use the rule of five.\
\
[00:25:20.660] - Liz\
Okay.\
\
[00:25:21.350] - Kelsey\
So if I have to do it more than five times in a certain time frame, so typically for me, it's within five times within a week or five times within a month, I need to automate it. That's typically how I phrase it, how I think about it. But you're right. You still absolutely have to balance it with, okay, if it's a really complex automation, that's going to be a bunch of different steps. Maybe that's if I'm doing it five times in a day.\
\
[00:25:49.420] - Liz\
Yeah.\
\
[00:25:50.440] - Kelsey\
If I'm doing it five times in a day, then yeah, it's probably worth that large investment. But if I'm doing it five times in a month, no.\
\
[00:25:56.120] - Liz\
Yeah. Well, so I look at it like, okay, if I spend a day figuring this automation out, am I going to get that at least that time back and then some? Which is where I... Because the summit, I'm like, Well, I'm only running the summit once a year. I really have six months where it's a focus, and four if those months, it's a real priority. And so building out some of the summit automations, I'm like, "Oh, my God, this is taking forever". But I'm like, but I'm going to have to do this thing for each session. And there's like 50 sessions. So as tedious as it is, it's so nice once it's working. So just considering that return on the automations and making sure that taking the time to set it up is worth it, because if it's a complex thing, if it's simple, yeah, save yourself the 20 seconds.\
\
[00:26:49.530] - Kelsey\
And what technology you need to do the setup. If it can be done in your CRM, that's probably something you're more familiar with. So low investment there. If you're going to need to use that Zapier, and you've never used that before, okay.\
\
[00:27:04.250] - Liz\
Yeah. No, I like that. Okay, let me just look at my notes, see if I had any other questions I wanted to make sure that we covered. Actually, real quick, let's touch on how to get started with SOPs if you don't have any. Because a lot of people, especially when you're a solopreneur, it's like, "Well, what do I need an SOP for?" So how to get started and make a habit of building those out, if you have any tips?\
\
[00:27:32.030] - Kelsey\
Yeah, absolutely. So my business is called the Neurospicy CEO, right? CEO is a really weird term for a lot of entrepreneurs. We don't think of ourselves like CEOs, except we own a business. It's ours. Thus we are a CEO. And so even a solopreneur who has no team, who is just starting out, if you have a business name, my dear, you are a CEO. And what that means is that eventually you might have a team. Eventually, you might have a business that brings in a nice chunk of revenue, because otherwise you probably wouldn't be doing a business. And so in order to make those things happen, you have to do certain things in a certain way. Now, your strategy can be all over the place. We've talked about all the different foundational pieces, but there are certain things you have to do. You probably, especially since we've talked about email list, need to send emails. That might be helpful. So... Not that much. You may need to repeat a process frequently called blog posting. That might be a thing that you do. And so for each of these things that you do in any sort of repeatable cadence, the first or second, usually the third time you do the thing, record yourself doing it. Now you can use a service called Scribe, it's free. It's nifty. It's okay. It's AI, so it's like meh.\
\
[00:29:10.250] - Liz\
Tango is another one that's good. I'm just throwing that out there.\
\
[00:29:13.170] - Liz\
Yeah.\
\
[00:29:13.710] - Kelsey\
So there's tools that will literally record what you do, both of them are equal, you know, record what you do and create a basic document for you with screenshots. And then there's two ways to use that that are really effective. The next time you go to do the thing, try to follow it and see if it actually makes sense. Or third, I meant second, but whatever. Second, when you bring on a VA, hand them that SOP and say, try to do it just like this the first time you do it. And then if it doesn't work, you edit it, you alter it because the terminology you used may not jive with the person.\
\
[00:30:01.710] - Liz\
Tools change and-\
\
[00:30:02.760] - Kelsey\
Yeah, yeah. But using it in those two ways. But it gives you the flexibility as a solopreneur who has no team, who barely thinks of themselves as a CEO, but is doing the thing over and over again. It gives you confidence that you're not missing anything. It gives you the freedom to do things even when your energy is low because you don't have to think about what the next right move is. And it ensures that your audience, in whatever fashion, is receiving things in a way that's consistent, even if you yourself are inconsistent.\
\
[00:30:39.040] - Liz\
Yes. No, I like that. That's amazing.\
\
[00:30:41.770] - Kelsey\
And I actually, truthfully, I have three different types of SOP. So for every SOP, I write, I write three versions.\
\
[00:30:47.590] - Liz\
Okay, tell me more.\
\
[00:30:48.750] - Kelsey\
I write a three spoon version, which is like the beautiful, very like corporate, spoony version. Sorry, that's my one-spoon version. That's my "I have no idea what I'm even thinking right now. I can barely function. I need every single step outlined for me, and I am going to do this like I'm a robot." That's my one-spoon version, and it's that very, very fleshed out version. I have a two-spoon version, which is like the template. It's got my general overarching ideas. It has reminders and good things. And then there's my three-spoon version. I've got all the energy. I want to do the thing, but I want to have the flexibility to play. And that's more of just an outline. It's got little reminders, things like that. And I flip them on their head. So in my Google Doc, it's a single Google document, but it's got each version with the basic outline, then the more detailed template, and then the bottom section is my really fleshed out SOP. And so whatever I'm feeling in the day, remember, I'm all about flexibility, right? Whatever I'm feeling in the day, I can go to the version that's going to support where I am, give me the wiggle room if I need it, or give me the full, comfortable, wrapped-up blanket structure if I'm in that place.\
\
[00:32:06.700] - Liz\
I like that. No, that's great. I hadn't actually thought about different types of SOPs, or different versions, I guess, of SOPs.\
\
[00:32:15.330] - Kelsey\
It's all in the same document, but it gives me that flexibility.\
\
[00:32:18.640] - Liz\
No, I like that. Fantastic. Okay, so we are running out of time, unfortunately. I have gotten a lot of ideas and just things percolating in my brain on how I want to adjust things in my business and hopefully everyone watching has as well. But I know you have some stuff to share, so why don't you tell us about that?\
\
[00:32:38.470] - Kelsey\
Yeah, absolutely. So I figured that I would make sure that we talked about a lot of different things today that I have a companion workbook called Simplify to Strategize. Words are hard. Simplify to Strategize is going to be a companion workbook that talks about setting up some of that scaffolding, how we talked about what to measure and how to have a single strategy. That's a workbook. You can work through it. It's quite literally just filling in the blank so that you can come up with something that looks like a flow chart. That's what I've got for you.\
\
[00:33:10.590] - Liz\
All right, well, that companion workbook sounds fantastic. I think you have something for the Speaker Bonus Bundle as well for people that have upgraded to get that.\

Yes, I do. So there's a masterclass that I'm going to give away within the Speaker bonus bundle called Fail-fast, Fail-often. And it does go into a little bit of the neurodivergent psyche. So if you're neurodivergent curious, think you might be, or know you are, it does go into a little bit of that. But really the bulk of the class that's applicable across all the different neurotypes is about how we look at failure and how we can utilize failure in our business to constantly improve, because you know what? We're all going to fall on our face. We're all going to fall on our tush. It's about how we use those experiences to create better business structures.\
\
[00:33:58.960] - Liz\
You will learn so much faster from taking action and it not working out than from research, research, research. Like done is better than perfect. Take a shot, see how it goes.\
\
[00:34:08.960] - Kelsey\
Analysis paralysis is a detriment to your business. So take a shot, fail.\
\
[00:34:14.290] - Liz\
Definitely. So yeah, if that sounds good to you guys, make sure you get yourself the Speaker Bonus Bundle or join the annual plan for the Blogger Breakthrough Summit membership, so you get access to all the sessions plus the Speaker Bonus Bundle. It's a great deal. So again, Kelsey, thank you so much for joining us. I learned a lot, and I know, I'm sure everyone did too.\
\
[00:34:33.650] - Kelsey\
This was an absolute blast. I loved it. Thank you so much for having me.\

Liz Stapleton [00:00:00]:\
Alright, guys. Today, I'm really excited for the session with Kristine, from Blogging about Momming. Thank you so much for being here. I really appreciate you taking the time.\
\
Kristine Beaves [00:00:09]:\
Thank you for having me.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:00:10]:\
Yeah. So you're gonna be talking about sort of how to balance blogging with life. Right? You know? Especially I mean, it's especially difficult for, parents. But but in general, if you have a 9 to 5 and you're trying squeezing your blog, you're trying to have a life and actually sleep, you know, it can be Yeah. Exactly. You know, because sleep is important. I'm a big fan of sleep.\
\
Kristine Beaves [00:00:34]:\
I mentioned it. Yeah.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:00:36]:\
Can you can you tell us a little bit about your background and then just kind of the highlights of what you're gonna cover today?\
\
Kristine Beaves [00:00:42]:\
So as you said, I'm Kristine from bloggingaboutmomming.com. I also have another blog. I'm a virtual assistant. I'm a former project manager and I have 2 kids, ages 2 and 4. So I'm super busy and the reason I kinda got into all of this is 5 years ago I had my first child, and it was a lot. So I decided to start a blog and I had no idea what I was doing. I looked back at my old stuff and I just cringe And, you know, balance you know, figuring out how to make it all work together, you know, we have some really great speakers in this summit that are gonna tell you about email marketing and how to make money blogging or start a podcast. And the one thing that a lot of people don't really talk about is how challenging it is to actually find the time to do the do all this this huge amount of stuff you're supposed to do as a blogger.\
\
Kristine Beaves [00:01:27]:\
So that's kind of what I do is I I with client work or through my blog, I help, you know, usually moms, but also regular bloggers, figure out how to make it all work together.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:01:38]:\
Alright. Awesome. And so you're gonna give us some, some tips and some actual advice, I take it?\
\
Kristine Beaves [00:01:43]:\
I am. Yes.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:01:44]:\
Alright. Well, I'm looking forward to that because, I I've been in the same boat. Right? So it's always a it's a balancing act. It's a high wire act or whatnot. Yeah. So I'm excited to to get to your presentation. Let's dig in.\
\
Kristine Beaves [00:01:58]:\
Alright. Thank you. Hi, everybody. Today, I wanna talk about balancing your life and your blogging. And some of you may be thinking, why am I covering this topic? Well, there are a lot of amazing speakers in this summit, and I think one of the things that we really don't get into is how to actually find time to blog while you've got all this other crazy stuff going on in your life. You know, maybe you're a work at home mom. Maybe you have a day day job. There's a lot of different things that go into this, and, you know, you're gonna hear you're probably really interested in hearing the talks about how to make money blogging or how to help you with your email marketing or maybe you wanna start a podcast, but in order to do that, you really need to figure out how to find the time and the energy and the brain space to actually make that happen and accomplish your goals.\
\
Kristine Beaves [00:02:48]:\
So as you've heard, I am my name is Kristine, and I am a former project manager. I used to work on projects for mobile applications for companies like Nick Jr, Toys R Us, rest in peace, Microsoft, and a bunch of others. And I am now a work at home mom, and I have 2 blogs. 1 is to help bloggers and mom bloggers, and I'm also a virtual assistant that also helps bloggers, and I have a crazy busy life. I have 2 kids. They're ages 2 and 4, and my one of them is special needs. So my specialty is really about helping people find the time to do what they love and figure out how to make it all work together. To start things off, I am gonna talk about something that I don't even remember where I heard about this, but I always talk to my clients and my blogging buddies about the burner analogy.\
\
Kristine Beaves [00:03:49]:\
So this is like a glorified pie chart of your life. So there's basically 4 different areas in your life, and I know this is an oversimplification, but think of this like a pie chart. You have 4 different burners in your life that you want to grow, you want to have fulfillment within. Maybe you wanna be you know, you need to focus on your health. You obviously need to eat right. You wanna take care of your mental health. You wanna make sure you're working out if possible, even if it's just going for walks. And then you've got your work, and that's where you you're gonna make your money, and that's where your career focus is.\
\
Kristine Beaves [00:04:22]:\
You also have your family. Maybe you have kids. Maybe you're married or have a partner. You also have extended family that you probably wanna spend time with. And then you also have friends, so that's your social life. You know? Getting close with your friends is really important and having that support group around you. So where do you focus all your time when you have all of these different priorities in your life? And so I've I've put together a few examples, and these will change based on where you are in your life. You know? Maybe you have young kids right now.\
\
Kristine Beaves [00:04:53]:\
And so if you have young kids, maybe you can only spend 15% of your time you know, picture a pie chart here, 15% of your time with your kids and 30% on work. Yeah. I mean, when you have young kids, you don't have as much time as some people to work on your blog, And the last thing you wanna do is is actually neglect your sleep. You know, a lot of us moms have to stay up late to get our our tasks done for our blog. But this also goes into, you know, your health. You wanna make sure that you're getting enough sleep. So you have less time to work, you need to spend more time with your family, and you may not have the time you need you want, I should say, to spend with your friends. And then imagine, for those of you out there who are full time day job people who actually go to a day job 8 hours a day, 5 days a week, and you're blogging.\
\
Kristine Beaves [00:05:43]:\
And and for those of you that have a day job, you blog, and you also have kids. Power to you. Holy moly. I can't even imagine. I'm a I am a work at home mom and that's hard enough. So you're gonna have a lot of time that you're gonna spend on working and you're gonna have a lot less time to focus on the other areas of your life that you actually care about. So maybe your main goal in all of this and in blogging is actually quitting that day job and becoming a full time Blogger. So your burners, your percentages, will actually change.\
\
Kristine Beaves [00:06:15]:\
And okay. So the next one I have is maybe your, you blog full time because you have school age kids. So while they're in school, you're actually working. So you have more time to work, but you need to do you have more time with your family because you have those kids that'll come home after school. So the reason that I mention this is that it's a good example of why you need to stop comparing yourself to other bloggers. Every blogger has a different circumstance. You are fighting against an entire spectrum of bloggers who can either have 8 hours a day to work on it, maybe it's 12, Maybe you're maybe you're a workaholic. But if you only have 2 hours a day that you can actually dedicate to your blog, you're gonna be have a hard time measuring yourself up and comparing yourself to other bloggers who have more time and energy to do this.\
\
Kristine Beaves [00:07:07]:\
And that's why I'm gonna get into, yes, yet another analogy. And this just bear with me here. Blogging is like conducting a symphony. It really is. If you think about it, think about all the different things you need to do as a blogger. And here, we'll get into it a little bit. So bear with me here because I am not a music person, but this is how I kind of visualize it in my head. So there's all these different instruments in the orchestra.\
\
Kristine Beaves [00:07:37]:\
They have their place. They have their their part to play within that symphony. There's you know, say the drums are like your blog content because that's what really matters. That's gonna set the tempo of your business. You have to have good content constantly going out there. And then you also have the horns or the brass. That's your email marketing, and that's gonna be announcing your presence to your audience. So those are the people that actively want to engage with you and are on your email list.\
\
Kristine Beaves [00:08:02]:\
And then you have flutes, the woodwinds. So that's your social media. You're you're supporting your melody by constantly updating social media. You have violins, which is really like a frenzied look. You know? All of us want to make money blogging, at least the the vast majority of us. And you can do it really slow if if you're in a down phase, if you're, say, you're coming out of Christmas. And then when you get to the that Christmas season where you're you're potentially gonna make a lot of sales, you know, you're you're you're really banging on that violin back and forth back and forth as fast as you can. The violins are going to really be if you really think about it, it's how that that's just for me, if you visualize it, that is how you're gonna make your money.\
\
Kristine Beaves [00:08:44]:\
And then, you know, I picture the cellos, the deep strings, as the backbone of your business. That is going to be your brand. That is what you're gonna that's your voice. That's your visuals. That's everything. And then, of course, there's the conductor, which is you, and you are the brand owner. And you are the one that is in charge of making sure that all of these different instruments are working together and making a melody that people actually want to listen to. But the orchestra is much more than just having the instruments.\
\
Kristine Beaves [00:09:16]:\
You know, you you when you first start blogging, if you're brand new to if you automatically jump in there as the conductor and try making a symphony with all of these instruments, it's gonna be a mess. So the pitch of your symphony is basically like forming those connections with your brand and your audience. You're also gonna have to figure out what key it's in. That's your written voice, being consistent with your brand. And then the chords, which are a grouping of pitches, is your partnership between your content types and communication, so your email marketing, your social updates, all tying into your content. And the crescendo Liz, you know, just like I talked about with those violins, you know, you're that's when the crescendo is when the the music gets really loud. It builds and builds and builds up to that climax. And there if you're launching a product, if you're gearing up for the holidays, you're gonna have your work and your presence is going to build up and up and up and hopefully make a lot of sales or at least get a lot of visitors on your blog.\
\
Kristine Beaves [00:10:23]:\
And then there's the melody. And this is really how you have a cohesive message with your audience, so how all the instruments are working together. And then there's the harmony, which is understanding and answering the questions of your audience in a way that attracts them to follow you. You want to have a symphony with a harmony that people actually want to follow. They want you to be consistent. They want you to be a real you're going to answer all the questions that they have, so you're going to hit all those right notes to make that symphony really work and make people be dedicated to your brand. And as I mentioned before, you want to master each instrument separately. You wanna make sure that, say, you wanna start off with you know, if you're a brand new blogger, you want your content to be the first thing that you you focus on and maybe email marketing because you wanna get that your dedicated audience right on your email list, and you want to keep them engaged with you.\
\
Kristine Beaves [00:11:27]:\
And the other thing is as a conductor, you have to take breaks. Your arms are gonna get tired conducting all of those instruments, so you want to take breaks. And you need to realize that whether you're new or you've been blogging for a long time, your audience is gonna grow as you master all of these just different instruments. You're gonna hit different parts of the audience. Some of them really wanna interact with you on social media. Some of them want to just go to your blog and see what's going on. Some of them really love your emails. There's different ways you're gonna communicate you and your brand to your audience.\
\
Kristine Beaves [00:12:06]:\
So as you start mastering all these different parts, you're gonna get more people, more readers on your blog. And so you have to take all of these different things. Just imagine frantically waving your arms around a a conductor Right to get all of these things lined up, have a symphony, and actually get paying people to sit in your audience to listen to it. And those paying, you know, obviously, that there's, you know, they're paying for their clicking on your affiliate links. They're, signing up for you as a client or they're buying your products or your courses. You want to be able to show that you are not only an expert, but you have a personality, you have a voice that people actually want to follow. Now why am I doing analogies? And we're done with analogies. Don't worry.\
\
Kristine Beaves [00:13:01]:\
Because we get so caught up in all of the different things on our checklist. And even if you don't like my analogy, that's okay. But I wanted to illustrate that there is so much that goes into being a blogger. And you know what? This analogy works for everything in your life as well. You can easily translate conducting an orchestra to being a parent or maintaining relationships with your friends. There's there's so many different things you need to do, and instead of having it being a checklist, sometimes getting out of your head, getting away from the data and the planning, is actually really good to actually really think about this in the big picture. So let's actually get into how you can balance your life and blogging. And the first thing that I always suggest to my clients and my readers is to define your pain points.\
\
Kristine Beaves [00:14:04]:\
What are you struggling with? What is stressing you out? What is challenging you on a day to day basis? And then what we'll get into is setting realistic and measurable goals. Then we'll think about ways that we can be creative about finding time to actually reach our goals, and then we'll actually talk about making those changes, actually making those changes in your life to have a more fulfilling day every single day. Okay. Now we're gonna get into actually planning. So you'll want to get down, get down into the nitty gritty and figure out a schedule that dedicates time to figuring out your priorities and creating goals. And I wanna at least stress that, you know, we do have all of these pain points, and they're not all we can't spend all of our time making our lives better. We can't spend all of our time fixing the things that we are struggling with because there's things every single day that we need to do even if they aren't a priority to make us a happier person. And, you know, going back to the analogy, say you personally really don't like the sound of the horns.\
\
Kristine Beaves [00:15:20]:\
You hate them. And that is your email marketing. You if you really, really hate trying to come up with content consistently to send to your email list, that's gonna be a pain point. But you really I mean, if that's a priority for you to have an email list, which for most bloggers should be, you're going to have to dig into those horns and learn how they work. And and for as an example, maybe you work full time, but you don't enjoy your job. But it's a priority to you because you need the money. So the first thing, as I talked about, what we wanna do is define your pain points. And so all of this all this is is looking at every aspect of your life, not just blogging, and figure out what is causing you stress.\
\
Kristine Beaves [00:16:07]:\
What is challenging you? What can you do to actually what what can you define as the root cause of what of your challenges right now? And that can be a whole spectrum of things. Maybe you don't have a great relationship with your family and you wanna make it better, or you wanna separate yourself a little farther from your family. Maybe you're having a challenging time finding time to vlog, or maybe you feel like you can't be present with your kids. And I know that I'm gonna talk about I know a lot of you don't have kids, and that that's perfectly fine, But that's kind of my focus, and having kids had its own kind of bucket of challenges that go along with it. And sorry. I know this is a lot of text, but I wanted to at least have a visual that you can quickly look at and take notes if you want. So the next thing you want to do is after you've defined your priorities, you'll want to prioritize those. So you you have your pain points, and you'll want to figure out which one is causing you the most stress.\
\
Kristine Beaves [00:17:11]:\
And then what you do is you take those priorities and you turn them into goals. Your goal is to reduce your amount of stress in whatever it is that's in your life. For example, say you're stressed that you don't have any time with your kids. You'll wanna turn that priority or that pain point into a goal that's like maybe you wanna spend 1 hour of dedicated time with your kids every single day. So it's measurable. You can tell that you you you know if you don't spend that 1 hour a day every single day with your kids. Or maybe you feel like you're not making enough money from your blog, and your goal will be make a $100 from my blog in the next 3 weeks. So you know that if you don't hit that goal, you're not gonna make a $100 in the next 3 weeks.\
\
Kristine Beaves [00:17:57]:\
Does that make sense? And then what you do is you take those goals and you create a plan to actually reach them. And what you'll do is actually take that goal, and think about the end result. So in 3 weeks, you will have made a $100, and you'll start at the end. So you have a $100 in 3 weeks. How are you gonna accomplish that? Start from the end and make your way backwards. So starting to say so at number 4, incentivize purchases with a freebie in week 2. So stepping back and back and back for this particular example. It's for your first step will be to join 2 more affiliate programs by x date.\
\
Kristine Beaves [00:18:38]:\
And then once that's done, you'll create blog posts around those programs that you joined with your affiliate link by a certain day. Then you'll promote on social media, whatever you decide, in your email marketing at least once a week. And then, like I mentioned, incentivize the purchase with a freebie in week 2. Define ways that you can actually reach that goal and make your way backwards, and make them measurable and actionable. And in order to actually get to your goals, I want you to start thinking creatively. Sometimes when it comes to actually reaching your goal, it's not about getting help on that goal. It's about getting help to find the time and the brain space to reach that goal. And this can be all sorts of things.\
\
Kristine Beaves [00:19:29]:\
For example, for Blogger. You know, I'm sure all of you or most of you are active or at least belong to Facebook groups or some sort of online community where you can get support for blogging. You can somewhere you can ask questions so you're not just constantly searching Google for answers, and you can also you know, there's things like find an accountability partner. Find someone that you can talk to that will help you be accountable towards your goals. Tell them what you wanna do, and you can do this vice versa so they they can actually tell you what their goals are, and you keep each other accountable for reaching those goals. You can also find blogging mentors, and these are a little hard because bloggers are incredibly busy. But this is basically making friends with other Blogger, hopefully within your niche or at least someone that has expertise in an area you wanna work on, and work with them. And in in in many cases, this is actually signing up for coaching, which is obviously paid.\
\
Kristine Beaves [00:20:28]:\
So if it's not within your budget, see if you can find another blogger who has an expertise or skills that you want to emulate or learn from and make that connection with them. Do your research and see who are you following right now. Who can you ask questions? You know, you want somebody that you can connect with on a regular basis. And the other one is obviously Blog courses. And you wanna make sure, you know, there's a lot of really great speakers in the summit. Take a look at their resources. See what kind of courses they offer. It's very, very helpful to find the right courses to take.\
\
Kristine Beaves [00:21:04]:\
There are free courses out there, but they're not gonna be as informative, at least in many cases, as a paid course because a paid course will have premium top tips and tutorials for you on mastering your blogging career. And the other one is hiring a VA, a virtual assistant. The amount that you'll pay to get a virtual assistant will depend on the virtual assistant, the skills there they have, and basically how much time you want. And the good thing about virtual assistants is they can do pretty much anything, anything. If you hate doing email marketing and you're wasting so much time and energy creating those emails, scheduling those emails, automating your workflows, Find a VA that's good at that, enjoys it, and can take it off your plate. That can be something that that's how you fix your pain point. Okay. So and then there's also things you can do every day that's not about blogging.\
\
Kristine Beaves [00:21:59]:\
Now maybe think about how much time you spend every week just going to the grocery store. The time it takes to actually drive there, to do your shopping, waiting in line to check out, and then driving home, unloading the groceries. It's all you would be amazed how much time you spend, especially if you go more than once a week to the grocery store, especially if you have kids. Think about grocery delivery. Order your groceries. Have them delivered. You can be home working on your blog while someone else is doing the shopping for you. I'm not kidding.\
\
Kristine Beaves [00:22:31]:\
I do this, and it saves me so much time. I don't have to take my kids with me and get them in and out of the car and stop them from grabbing things on the shelves. You know, I I save myself hours a week just having my groceries delivered. And the next one is housecleaning. If you don't have time to clean, get a house cleaner. You can actually find them fairly inexpensive. Hire a gardener if you if you just either don't enjoy gardening or if you just don't have the time to dedicate to it. Do meal prep.\
\
Kristine Beaves [00:23:05]:\
Sched do meal planning once a week once a week. Have your groceries delivered with all the items you need, and then do your meal prep once a week. Save you so much time. If you have a day job, try carpooling. If you carpool, you might be able to sit in the back seat and actually get some work done. Or maybe you don't carpool, maybe you can take the bus. There's so many ways that you can grab little bits of time that actually add up to a big payoff. Now if you are a work at home parent and you have kids, you can do working play dates.\
\
Kristine Beaves [00:23:37]:\
And that's where you actually join forces with other parents who have kids who hopefully are doing something at least similar to what you're doing. And you just take turns watching the kids while the other person works, and then you trade off. You can also do babysitter trades, which are a little bit harder to find. But if you don't have the money for babysitters, find another parent who also is a work at home parent or a stay at home parent. And say you watch their kids for 3 hours on one day, and on another day, you watch their kids for 3 hours. So they can work or they can go grocery shopping. They can go, I don't know, go to the spa. Who knows? And the next one is a mother's helper, which is just the the phrase, dad's helper, whatever you wanna call it.\
\
Kristine Beaves [00:24:19]:\
These are teenage people that you can come over and they can do your laundry. They can do your meal prep. They can do all sorts of things. They don't have to watch your kids. You can also you know? And and this one's a bigger one, is drop in day care. Maybe you wanna work out and you wanna work on that health burner. You find a gym that has a daycare, somewhere that you can drop your kids off while you work out. Then Summit obvious ones like after school programs, lessons, summer camps, some way to get your kids out and engaged so that they're not just sitting around while you're working.\
\
Kristine Beaves [00:24:50]:\
And on top of all of this, regardless if you have kids or not, if you have a partner or a spouse, if you have family members and friends, ask them for help. You know, they they don't have to help with your kids. They can help with laundry. They can help with dishes. They can do all of the little things around your house. Maybe maybe your mom wants to do grocery shopping for you. Fantastic. As an example of thinking creatively, in order to get this video done for the summit, I am currently recording this in my car.\
\
Kristine Beaves [00:25:21]:\
I have my Blue Yeti microphone on my steering wheel, and I'm talking to you guys. And why did I do this? Because I have kids, and even though I try very hard to find time to do what I need to do with my kids around, filming a long video and expecting my kids not to disturb me, Not really reality for me. So my husband is at home watching my kids while I sit in my car looking at a beautiful landscape where it's quiet and recording a video. Think outside the box. No. This is not glorious. This isn't this is not something that I picture when I picture successful bloggers doing their thing. And you know what? I enjoy working in my car.\
\
Kristine Beaves [00:26:10]:\
It's quiet. I can go anywhere that I want, but it's also unusual. And that's because I have challenges at home, so I do workarounds to make it work and get my job done. Think creatively. And, again, these are not things that you have to do to actually make progress on your goals. It's finding that time and that brain space to actually work on getting the time to do those goals. That was pretty long, so let's let's just move on. Now let's talk a little bit about time management.\
\
Kristine Beaves [00:26:42]:\
Now there's this amazing system called time blocks where you create a schedule and you block out your time throughout the day. And you can get down into the nitty gritty, and we'll get into that in a minute. But, basically, all you need to do is take your your daily schedule for every day of the week and figure out when you're gonna work on things. Now I won't go through this whole thing, but just for example, you maybe this is an example with someone who has a day job. So you you wake up, you do your breakfast, you have an hour to get ready and do your breakfast, and then you go to work. And then when you get home from work at 5 PM, you would spend 30 minutes with your partner. And then later on, after you've, you know, called a friend because you wanna do that social burner, you've cleaned because who wants to live in a dirty house, at 7:30 at night, you have 2 dedicated hours to work on your blog. And then, of course, you wanna take some time afterwards to take care of yourself.\
\
Kristine Beaves [00:27:37]:\
Some call it, quote, unquote, self care. I call it self respect. Respect yourself enough to take care of yourself. And then you go to sleep at 10. This is merely allowing yourself to have dedicated time to focus on one part of your life, one burner. And the next thing we're gonna get into is so you can do this very high level. You do not have to get into this nitty gritty. You know, I'm a data person.\
\
Kristine Beaves [00:28:01]:\
I love organization. So the next thing you can do is so you have your time blocks, which are like your buckets. But then what do you fill those buckets with? You can get down into time boxes, and this is setting a time limit on every task that you do. And this can get pretty laborious depending on how, in detail you get about this, but so you can say maybe you have 10 minutes or 20 minutes on your lunch break or maybe while your child naps, and you can break up, say, that hour. And say Right 10 minutes, I'm gonna work on social media updates. I'm gonna respond to blog comments. Or maybe you have 45 minutes. You can plan out a week of social media.\
\
Kristine Beaves [00:28:42]:\
You can write a blog post. Doing this and actually setting a timer is going to absolutely increase your productivity and your focus. You know when you go and, you know, a lot of you have this on your own blogs, but if there is a time limit say there's a countdown timer on a product offer on a website, and you have 10 minutes to decide whether or not you wanna take advantage of that deal. What does that do? It makes you focus on what the offer is to see if it's something you wanna take advantage of because you only have 10 minutes to decide. It focuses your mind and your energies on what is in front of you. So it's the same exact thing with a a timer. You get a little timer. Everyone has them on their smartphones, and you'd have a timer for how long you wanna spend on things.\
\
Kristine Beaves [00:29:31]:\
So if you only have 10 minutes to do social media updates, that means you get to avoid shiny syndrome. We all have this, especially as bloggers in the digital world. Shiny syndrome is a huge time management problem. As you're scrolling through your Facebook feed or trying to go to your social share threads, It's amazing how much time you can waste going down the rabbit hole of, oh, this is an amazing article. Oh, that's an amazing article. I wanna read that too. That's not what you're doing. You're supposed to be going in there and sharing your latest blog post on a share thread and then resharing whatever that share thread rules are.\
\
Kristine Beaves [00:30:13]:\
But is that what you're actually doing? A lot of the time it's not. So if you have that timer in your face saying you have 10 minutes to complete a share thread or your share your social updates, You are gonna focus 100% on completing that task. And this this is an amazing system, and you do not have to get into the nitty gritty of every single little detail. But setting that timer is really gonna help you balance everything, and this does not have to be blogging specific. This can be you know, we talked earlier about wanting to spend an hour of dedicated time with your kids. So you can set a timer for that. You'll know that for that 1 hour, you are 100% focused on your kids, or you have a half an hour to make a phone call with your friend. Now it might be kind of rude to have a conversation after 30 minutes when you hear a buzzer go off, but you get what I'm saying.\
\
Kristine Beaves [00:31:04]:\
Backtracking a little bit. So we've talked about your time management. We've talked about setting goals, but we all know that all of our tasks that we do every single day are completely beyond our pain points. Our pain points aren't the only thing that we have to work on every single day. So this is more about making your pain points your priority and to fix them to make a more fulfilling day to day, but there are gonna be those tasks that you need to work on that are not around your pain points. Basically, the easiest way to do this is, say, every Sunday. Right after you set your schedule with your for time management and you set your time blocks. Excuse me.\
\
Kristine Beaves [00:31:44]:\
Set aside some time, maybe on a Sunday, to plan out your week. Re-evaluate your priorities and your goals. Are they where they where they should be? Do you need to change any of them? Are there priorities or goals that you need to add that aren't related to your pain points? All I'm asking for you is to prioritize you as a whole person before focusing on anything else. Let's recap. You want to define your priorities based on your pain points, and then you can add more underneath that, because once you fix those pain points, that's when you're gonna be able to have clarity. You're gonna free yourself up to focus on the things that you think really matter. You know, you you need to send out your email updates. You need to spend time with your kids.\
\
Kristine Beaves [00:32:28]:\
But in order to do that, if you have these nagging thoughts in the back of your head of things that are really bothering you, that are challenging you, you're gonna be multitasking at all times, basically, in your head, stressing about things. So focus on your pain points and then work on other things. And of course, set goals from those priorities and make sure they're measurable, realistic, and actionable. And then, of course, create your plan around those goals. You're gonna wanna make sure that your goals are within your plan, those actionable items that we talked about, creating those steps to reach your goal. You know, the example was make $100 from your blog in 3 weeks. You wanna make sure that every step to reach there is within your plan. So within those time blocks, you can also use the time boxes, so the little nitty gritty ones.\
\
Kristine Beaves [00:33:19]:\
You can use those to define how long you have to work on each part to reach your goals. I am an organization nerd as I've mentioned, so I have a my blog workbook. It's completely free. You can either print it out or you can actually type in into the forms there. It's fillable, and it it covers pretty much everything that you could need. You can track all your affiliate programs. You can track your logins. There's checklists for SEO, checklists for posts.\
\
Kristine Beaves [00:33:49]:\
There's scheduling. It has pretty much everything you need to track your blog. And the reason why I think this is such a good tool for you to download is because getting things out of your head and onto paper, whether it's digital paper or physical paper, means you have a quick reference. Going back to the time management, constantly having to search for files on your computer or trying to remember what the hex values are for your colors. If you added up all the time you spent searching for things, you would be amazed. Use this workbook to track everything. I do mine in spreadsheets and within printables as well. I just realized how much time I was spending searching for my brand colors or you know, I changed my entire file structure.\
\
Kristine Beaves [00:34:44]:\
I I do sell an actual file structure that you can use so you don't lose a file. I sell those in my shop. Get organized, build a plan, and reach your goals. One thing that I do wanna stress is we've already gone through this, so you wanna define your pain points, focus on what truly matters, which is you. You are the one that matters, which why I tell you to focus on your pain points. What are you struggling with? What's stressing you out? Plan smart. Go find ways to develop a plan that eliminates or at least lessens those pain points so you can focus on the things that you need to actually grow your blog or have a a more fulfilling friendship with your friends or spend more time with your kids and actually make those changes. A lot of us have a very hard time making changes because we fear failure, and failure just means something doesn't work.\
\
Kristine Beaves [00:35:43]:\
Failures are amazing indicators of exactly what you need to change. See them as a positive thing. If you try some of these methods that I've just talked about and they don't work, try something else. What works for you is gonna be different for than what works for other people. Failures are golden. You if you send out an email blast and you wanna make sales and you don't make any, okay. You didn't make any sales. That sucks.\
\
Kristine Beaves [00:36:15]:\
But what can you change to make it happen next time? And the other thing I will mention is you can build all the plans that you can. You can schedule in time blocks all over the place, but I'm gonna stress this. Shit happens. You're going to fall behind. Things aren't going to happen, and you're not not gonna reach your goals. Now this isn't to discourage you. It's only to say that you're going to get sick. Your kids are gonna get sick.\
\
Kristine Beaves [00:36:47]:\
You're gonna have a family emergency. There's something is gonna come up. Your car breaks down. You blow a tire. You're you need to replace your fence. You know, there's gonna be financial things that come up. Shit is going to happen. Don't see those as a failure.\
\
Kristine Beaves [00:37:06]:\
Some of those it's it's not even a failure. It's basically just a a it's something that's causing you to derail for a minute. But get yourself back on course. Maybe you wanna double down the next week that you you maybe 1 week, your kids got sick, and you couldn't complete your the blog post you wanted. So the next week, you can maybe do 2 blog posts, but you make sure that one of them is maybe a roundup, which is super easy, and your other one is the your whole content blog post. Just move with it. Failure is good. Test out what works and move on.\
\
Kristine Beaves [00:37:43]:\
Alright. There was so much more that I wanted to talk to you guys about, but my time is limited, and I've tried to really make sure that the things that I talked about were actually related to my topic. I hope you enjoyed my fun little analogies. I hope they help you kinda get outside your head and really think about where you are in your life, and I hope you enjoy the summit.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:38:03]:\
Right, Kristine. Thank you so much for all that amazing, advice and information. Definitely have a a lot to think about in terms of adjusting the way I do things, so thank you.\
\
Kristine Beaves [00:38:14]:\
Mhmm. You're welcome.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:38:15]:\
So I know you do have a free resource for our attendees. Can you tell us a little bit about it?\
\
Kristine Beaves [00:38:20]:\
So like I said in the video, I have a free resource called the my blog workbook. And it's basically a way to get everything organized for your blogs from your, a list of your affiliates, your login details, it's got checklists if you're brand new to blogging, checklists for SEO, for your blog posts. It's really to help you because the reason that I gave this away as a as a resource and made it possible for everyone to download it is that to get all those details out of your head and onto paper, even if it's digital paper, is to get it out of your head and have less to worry about. You don't have to look for your values, for your colors, and all that. I can't tell you how much time I've wasted looking for things. So it's just a added benefit of getting extra organized so you can save even more time and be more efficient.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:39:07]:\
Yes. I, I can relate so hard to looking at the hex codes. I used to Canva, then I, like, stopped using Canva. So now I have them as, like, a text short code, but past time, I forget that I have them as tech.\
\
Kristine Beaves [00:39:18]:\
I even have them on a little post it on my computer because I I hear them all the time.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:39:22]:\
Yeah. Alright. Well, everyone should go grab that. Christine, thank you so much for for doing this. I really appreciate you taking the time, your generosity, so thank you.\
\
Kristine Beaves [00:39:32]:\
Of course. And if if anyone needs anything, I'll be in the Facebook group. So feel free to ask any questions and I'll be there.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:39:38]:\
Alright. Awesome, guys. Definitely take advantage of that that generous offer. So thank you again and, we'll catch you at the next session. Alright.\
\
Kristine Beaves [00:39:45]:\
Thank you very much.\

**Transcript:**\
[00:00:00.000] - Krystianna Pietrzak\
Hello and welcome to this presentation on how to use Notion to manage your blog content. I'm KP. I use she, her, or hers pronouns, and I'm the founder of Inkpot Creative which is a queer-led show at website design studio building unconventional impactful branded websites for changemakers who are leading our industry by creating something different. I am also the host of The Unexpected Entrepreneur podcast. However, before I ever even started Inkpot Creative, I actually started a book blog back in 2012 which has since been completely rebranded and is now a travel blog called Volumes and Voyages as of 2019. And that's because back in 2019, during my junior year of college, I studied abroad in Dublin and was inspired to start a travel blog. Ever since, I have been chasing my wanderlust and following my passions. I'm truly happiest when I'm on top of a mountain with a good view and no signal. But in order to take trips and stay on top of my work, I really had to implement a strategic system, and I found that Notion was my ultimate solution. Before we get started, I did want to mention that you should really try not to follow along with everything that I'm doing at the same time.\
\
[00:01:23.240] - Krystianna\
So, I would recommend watching the video all the way through first and then, of course, like pop back in, if you need to, to rewatch things and then try to follow along there when you can actually pause the video as you go. And of course, if you have any questions, feel free to pop them in the chat because I will be there hanging out with you. So, by the end of this presentation, you'll have a solid idea of how to create and implement a Notion blog management system. As far as the agenda, we'll first start by talking a little bit about why you should use Notion, why it's a great fit, and why I personally love it. We'll also talk about how to use Notion to your advantage. So that's when we'll dive into more of the tutorials on how to create and manage content, how to organize your posts, and also how to collaborate. And then we'll also chat about some action steps, and I'll also give you a free gift. So keep in mind as well that this is just what I found works for me. Notion is definitely not for everybody, and the way that I organize posts probably won't work for everybody.\
\
[00:02:16.170] - Krystianna\
So, don't feel like you have to do exactly what I do. You can take part of it and add it into your own system, especially if you already have something that works well for you. You really have the power to take what I am teaching and put your own spin on it. So, let's start off by talking about why you should use Notion and what makes it so great. So, if you've never heard of Notion before, Notion is a productivity app. You can use it for pretty much anything from planning your daily life to organizing your blog content. You can think of it kind of like a mix of different project management tools out there like Asana or ClickUp or even Trello combined with Google Docs. And the only difference is you build everything from scratch which means you can custom tailor it to your specific needs. Some great features of Notion include to-do lists, so you can keep track of what you have to do every day. And you can also assign tasks, which is awesome if you have a team. And you can also go through and even add due dates to your different tasks too.\
\
[00:03:10.970] - Krystianna\
You can also pretty much embed anything from videos like on Loom or Google Drive, to maps and even audio which makes it so great to pretty much just collaborate with anyone that you need to. You can also create databases which is what we'll mainly be talking about today. So you can organize your content in a whole bunch of different views. So you can use tables which is what is in the photo over here. You can also use Kanban boards which is kind of like what you'd see on Trello. You can use galleries if you're more visual. You can also use lists, timelines, and calendars. There's also an app, so you can easily check your content or add any new content while you're on the go or while you're traveling. And this is actually one of those apps that works super great. I use it while I'm on the go all the time, especially if someone tags me in something. It is so easy to just like open it up, respond quickly, and just continue whatever I'm doing. And it is also free. So there is a paid version, but if you don't have a team that you need to collaborate with, then you can 100 percent start with free.\
\
[00:04:05.750] - Krystianna\
So that's what I did. And then you can upgrade later. And if you do end up wanting to use the paid version, it is only eight dollars a month, starting at eight dollars a month, I'll say, which is a lot more budget-friendly than other tools out there, at least from what I have found. And if you're currently managing your blog content somewhere, let me know if any of these sound familiar. Let me know if you've ever felt disorganized. So one thing that I ran into a lot was I felt like I was juggling multiple platforms for various parts of blog management. So I was using, you know, something like Later for my content creation. Then I was tracking my published posts in my Google Sheets, and I was trying to collaborate with a team somewhere else, or even inconsistency. So one thing that you might run into is if the tool that you're using is hard to use and has a steep learning curve, you might avoid going in there to keep it updated at all which can cause a lot of inconsistencies, so, for example, if you have 500 posts on your blog, but only 480 are actually being tracked in your current blog content management system.\
\
[00:04:59.520] - Krystianna\
And collaboration -- so you might have difficulty in team collaboration sharing ideas and getting feedback, and you might have also found that it always costs more to add somebody to whatever plan you're on and also ease of accessibility. So it might be difficult to access your content and make updates anywhere anytime, especially when traveling. So, having something on your phone would probably be a lot easier. These are all issues, again, that I personally ran into and Notion has honestly solved all of them. So for instance, with this organization, one thing that Notion does is that it is all in one. So, it combines writing, organization, and collaboration. So you can create a content calendar for your blog, for your social media. You can collaborate and more. No more inconsistency because of the way Notion works. You can be completely in control. So, you get to decide what is and isn't in your dashboard for your blog. You really get to custom tailor it to you and your specific needs. And collaboration -- so, it is so easy to collaborate. You can easily share things. You can comment and tag each other. You can also assign tasks which makes team collaboration effortless, and it also does not cost as much to add people.\
\
[00:06:06.730] - Krystianna\
And lastly, there is universal access. So it has a synced/offline mode where you can work offline, and when you get Internet again, your edits will be uploaded directly to your database, and then there's also an app. All that to say, Notion can help you feel more empowered when it comes to managing your blog content. So this all sounds great, but how do you actually use it to manage your blog content? To start off really simple just make sure you make your Notion account if you haven't already used Notion before. So you can do this at Notion.so. And again, you can probably start off with the free plan. And then from there you'll want to go ahead and set up your dashboard. So to make this easy so that you do not have to start it from scratch and you can pretty much just start from a template, I have made one for you that you can easily duplicate and customize to your needs which you can grab at inkpotcreative.com/breakthrough. Once you've duplicated it, you'll want to go ahead and brand it. If you want to, this is totally optional, but it is one of the cool and fun things about Notion.\
\
[00:07:06.560] - Krystianna\
So you can add a cover photo to add a photo of your favorite place. So for instance, that photo on the left is a photo of my actual Notion dashboard that I use for my blog. I have a photo of Bryce Canyon just because it's my favorite national park here in the US. You can also upload your brand's logo, and you can also go through and change any of the colors. Next, you want to go ahead and start to customize the board for your needs. So, I recommend that you sit down and think about what you actually need when it comes to tracking your different blog posts. So obviously you're going to want your blog post title, but maybe you also want to track your keyword or the post category, or the post URL, or even if you have any back links to that content, what affiliate links you have in that post, et cetera. And if you're not sure, you can totally just use what's in the board already. I'm pretty sure I have all of those actually in the board and then some. And then if you find that you don't use specific parts of the board, you can always delete them which I'll show you how to do.\
\
[00:08:00.720] - Krystianna\
You might also find new columns that you wish were actually added in, and you can add those in as you grow. So, my board actually changes all the time. So now let's hop over to Notion to go over how to customize the board by removing the different categories that you don't need. So this is what the database will look like after you've duplicated it and added it into your own Notion account. So the first thing to do is if you decide that for each of your posts, you do want all of this information, but maybe you don't want all of it showing, what you'll do is click this little button with these three dots, and then you'll hit Properties, and you'll be created with a little list that looks like this and you'll see all these little eyeballs, and essentially all you have to do is click on one if you don't want it to show in this actual database anymore. So let's say maybe you no longer want to have the category here, you can just go ahead and hide it. And the cool thing is if you've just hidden it in the table, if you come over here and actually open up that specific blog post, you'll still be able to see the category in here.\
\
[00:09:03.310] - Krystianna\
So really, all you're going to customize right now is everything at a bird's eye view. If you decide you want to add something back in, you could just turn that back on and you can actually drag it up to wherever you would like it. Alternatively, if you decide there are any that you like 100 percent know you don't want at all, this is also where you can go ahead and delete them. So you can come in here and just right-click and hit delete property and it will fully delete itself. So next, you are going to want to go ahead and customize your post templates. And this is where you will actually add in all of those different categories and all of those different elements that we talked about back in step four. So some things you can update during this time is your post categories and your affiliate programs as well as any statuses, if you need them. So just to kind of briefly go over it. When it comes to post categories for me on my database, what I like to do is make them location based. So I blog mostly about the United States. So what I'll do is I'll make different categories for each of the different states,\
\
[00:10:05.040] - Krystianna\
and then if I do ever do anything on another country, I will have a country category. You can also just easily match these up to the same categories you use on your own blog, if that helps. For affiliate programs, I actually go through and add all of the different affiliate programs that I use which I'll show you in the next slide. And then for statuses, I actually use statuses in order to kind of track if I've updated a post or not because I try to update my post every six months. So here is what one of my post templates actually looks like with a post that I've added into my own personal Notion database so you can actually see it in action. So, you'll see up here we have the post category, and this is again where I would just put the location for affiliates. Again, like I mentioned, I'll go through and add all the different affiliate programs I'm in, and if I know that it's through a certain place like Travelpayouts, I'll like kind of write an abbreviated version. So this is like Travelpayout to Discover Cars. And I have it set too so that I can multi-select. So if there is multiple affiliates in a post, I can go through and check them all off,\
\
[00:11:04.620] - Krystianna\
and then same with the post category if I ever have to. For keyword, this is pretty basic, just where I write the keyword out. I do have a pins one right now because I was recently going through and making sure that all my posts have new pins directly in the post. So I added, like, a checkbox just so I could track that. Then I also have this ranking one because I recently also went through and was tracking on my rankings with all of the updates that have been going on. And that's just so, again, I can track how rankings are doing. For status, this is how I keep track of if I've updated a post or not. So I have statuses for not started, in progress, and updated. Then URL is pretty self-explanatory. This is just where I go ahead and put the URL in for the blog post just in case I ever really easily need to grab it. So now, I'm going to briefly go over how to add those in Notion into your templates. Okay. So now, we are back in Notion, and what you'll want to do this time is actually click on this little blue arrow, and you'll see a option that says Post Template.\
\
[00:12:03.020] - Krystianna\
And what you want to do is hit these three dots and click Edit. And basically, what this is doing is editing a template in the database. So now, anytime you go to add a new one, you will actually get created with a card that looks like this. It'll have everything that you're adding directly into that template for you to fill out. So, if I just go back to that really quick, what you want to do first is go in and add your categories. So to do that just click where it says empty and you'll have these options. You'll see a few random states in here that I put in here just as placeholders for you. To change those, you can just click this little button with the three dots, and you can come in here and change it to whatever you want. So, you can just do it like that. You can also change the colors if you want to be really specific. Then if you need to add new ones, you can just type in right here and just hit Create and it'll add a new one for you, and make sure you keep none of them selected because this is the template.\
\
[00:12:53.800] - Krystianna\
Otherwise, if you add a new post, it'll have that category auto-selected for you. Affiliates -- again, this is just where I kind of list out my different affiliates so you can edit these ones if you want. Just click these three dots and you can change what they say. And then if you need to add any more, you can add them in the same way you did with your category. These you can leave blank because these are going to be dependent on each specific post. Status -- this is one that you can definitely just keep how it is if you will be kind of updating your post as well. And then I also have a web stories one in here which you can either keep in here or like rename to pins or use it as whatever you'd like. And then this section two, if you ever need a spot where you really want to be taking notes before you even like publish a post or anything like that, you can add like some more templates down here. So maybe you always like have a specific checklist you follow as you're doing research you can literally be like research checklist. And then you can add a block for a checklist.\
\
[00:13:51.850] - Krystianna\
So, if you hit forward slash on your keyboard, you'll be brought up with a screen that lists all these different block options. So, you can type in checklist and then you'll have a to-do list. And you can list out step one, step two, and you can list out anything you want. But just know that anything you type out here again will be in that template. So, it will be there for every single post that you go to write. And then once that's saved, all you have to do is hit back and you'll be brought back to this. And then when you go to hit New, you'll see that now it'll be updated. So, if I come in here, it should have Nevada in here which it does. So that's how we know that it worked. And then if you need to add any new categories in, what you want to do is make sure, again, you're in that template and you just want to hit Add a property. So, if you want to add a new one in, just come and try to find the specific type of property you want to add. There are so many options.\
\
[00:14:43.190] - Krystianna\
So maybe you always want to upload your featured image or something you can click files and media and just change this to featured image. And now, you'll have an option where you can actually upload a photo. You could also get even more fancy with it. Maybe you want to add a calendar so you can search for date. Maybe you want to have last updated. You can come in here and now you have a calendar where you can add dates for it when you update your posts. So what your next step is to organize your blog posts. And if you have a lot of posts like I did when you start implementing a system like this, this is going to take you the most time. So start by creating as many views as you need. I like to have different views for all posts, to do, completed, and then have one for pins and web stories. And what this is going to do is just basically give you a filtered databases. So what that means is if I want to add one maybe that will only show me all of my Nevada posts, all I have to do is click this button and I'm going to create a new table.\
\
[00:15:42.620] - Krystianna\
And that's just because that's what I kind of had set up already. So, I'm going to call this one Nevada Post and hit done. And then I'm going to want to filter it. So, I'll click, Filter, Category, and I'm just going to check Nevada and that'll only show Nevada because I have it saying category contains Nevada. If I want to have it just show the posts that aren't Nevada, I could click does not contain and that'll show me all of the other ones. So, I recommend going through and adding this in for each of the different views that you want. You can also further organize by choosing the layouts that you prefer. So as you saw in that quick screenshot that I just showed, I choose table, and that's just because I kind of prefer to see everything all at once like that. But there are also boards. You can use a timeline. You can use a calendar, if you want to organize it by date published or something. You could use a list and you can even do a gallery which is a great option if you're a super visual person. And then once that is all set up, you're actually on the last step of organizing.\
\
[00:16:38.880] - Krystianna\
And this is the part of six that is going to take you the longest, I promise you. It is very tedious. Unfortunately, it does have to be manual. But, if you have a virtual assistant on your team or a friend that can help you, then it will go a lot faster. So this is when you're actually going to go through, click that little blue button that says New and go through and manually add all this information for each of your posts. I did want to mention too, if you need to collaborate at all, Notion makes it so easy to share with anyone that you want. So you will have a button in the corner that will say share. You just want to click on that and then select the access that you want someone to have. So generally, I'll give people can edit access because then they can go in there, they can comment, they can add things to the database and everything like that, but they just can't share it with anyone else. If you do like have a partner or somebody that you run the blog with, you can go ahead and click Full Access, and then everyone that you've added will be able to go ahead and fully change things.\
\
[00:17:29.830] - Krystianna\
You just want to be careful if you do can comment or can view, those people will not be able to add anything to your database for you. One thing I want to mention is you will see an option to hit publish and just make sure you don't publish it to the web because what this can do is it can also, I've heard anyway, start ranking on Google which you don't want because then everyone's going to see all of your blog information. So I know that was a lot. So here's just a quick recap of what you should do -- action step wise. So, go ahead and set up your Notion account. Use free unless you know you'll be collaborating a lot. Then start by setting up your dashboard. So for the purpose of saving time, go ahead and just duplicate that board that I created and shared. And then, optionally, you can go ahead and brand it if you want to make it feel more like you by customizing the cover photo, the icons. You can add your logo and everything like that. You can also customize the boards. So think about what info you actually need for your posts.\
\
[00:18:26.280] - Krystianna\
And if you're just starting, know that the less you have can be a lot easier to manage. And then you want to customize your post template, so go ahead add in your categories and everything like that. And then lastly, organize your posts. So, go through, set up your different views, your different filters, and begin adding all of your backlog. Just know that it will take you a while. When I first started organizing my posts, I already had more than 300. I really wished that I had started organizing things sooner, and it took me about a week to get everything all set. But it helped me so much in the long run. If you have any questions, feel free, again, to pop them in the chat. Now that you have watched the presentation, I truly do geek out about Notion, so I'm happy to answer any and all questions. And again, to help you kickstart your Notion journey, I did go ahead and make that dashboard for you that I showed you way back at the beginning, and you can grab that at inkpotcreative.com/breakthrough. And this is a great way for you to at least have a starting point when it comes to starting to track all of your blog posts in Notion.\
\
[00:19:30.550] - Krystianna\
And if you do ever want to learn more about how to use Notion in your business, Standout with Notion is in the Speaker Bonus Bundle. And this is a course that I created that literally goes over how to create different Notion dashboards from scratch. This one does cover a lot more kind of geared towards actual business owners. So, it will show you how to make things like client portals if you ever work with clients or anything like that, and also how to create your own to-do lists. So it does go a little bit deeper. And if you want to stay in touch, you can find me over on my podcast The Unexpected Entrepreneur. I'm also on Instagram @inkpotcreative and @volumeandvoyages. And you can check out my website at inkpotcreative.com. Thank you so much.\

[00:00:12.460] - Liz\
All right, guys. I'm so excited for our speaker in this session because she has literally helped transform my business this past year. She is the owner of Process Driven, where she helps small teams systemize their entire team operations by mastering ClickUp. Layla Pomper is here. Thank you, Layla, so much for being here. I'm going to try not to fan girl too much.\
\
[00:00:33.860] - Layla\
No, thank you so much for having me. I'm excited to be here and you know, I always get a little nervous when folks say they've been working on stuff based on what we say, because I'm like, oh, no, has something gone wrong? And it's going to come into this interview. But I'm happy to hear that we've been able to help and I'm excited to chat with you about all things content today.\
\
[00:00:51.820] - Liz\
Yes. So, we're talking about you know systemizing and repurposing workflows. Let's kind of define those terms for people if they aren't familiar and they're just flying by the see of [inaudible 00:01:02]. How would you define a system versus a workflow? How they work together?\
\
[00:01:07.540] - Layla\
Yeah, I think those are hard and I think we often get caught up on the terminology of the process space that keeps us from feeling like we can't even dip our toe in the water. I think what I like to view process as is kind of a journey to a fixed destination. Workflow tends to be, I think, an easier metaphor, sometimes like an assembly line. It's more of this repeating thing that flows and they kind of work hand in hand. So, usually when we're talking about a repurposing workflow, what we're talking about is figuring out what's one loop around the assembly machine, so we can repeat it. And that goes hand in hand between these two topics.\
\
[00:01:44.910] - Liz\
Okay. Because there are so many pieces that go into creating content, whether that's for YouTube or blog posts or whatever. So, what you're saying is like, each step figuring out the assembly line, is that fair to say? \
\
[00:02:00.970] - Layla\
Yeah, we basically, we want to be you know like, forward here and we want to figure out you know what is the assembly line we want for where we are right now and then let's do it. And the next time we go around that assembly line, maybe we add another piece of it. But that's kind of my view when it comes to processes. Yeah, figure out what loop you want for your content, for your brand, for your capacity. Let's just make that loop really tight and work really well. And then maybe we make the assembly line a little longer. We add some paint color, we add some additional repurposing. But that's kind of my approach.\
\
[00:02:32.170] - Liz\
Okay. So, if someone is just they've been blogging, they sit down, they write their post, they publish it. Honestly, I don't know how people do that, but I know I did at some point, I'm sure, but I can't bounce on it now. Where should they start and why should they start kind of figuring out this process? How is that going to help?\
\
[00:02:52.540] - Layla\
Yeah, so I'll answer the first part first and then I think it should hopefully make the 'why' part a bit more relatable. So, if you're just getting started and I get it, what you're talking about, of just getting down, creating the content, moving on, if you're that superhero mode, what I would ask you to do is to take a moment to just reflect on what you're doing. And oftentimes this is done with sticky notes or a piece of paper and just write down what do you do at a high level. So, you sit down. Cool. You maybe write a script or an outline. You write the post and you publish it. That's great. You've just defined your assembly line. And that's what I would suggest someone do when they just get started. Have it written down, so that the next time you sit down to do that again, you know what you're doing and what you're going to find, and the value of doing this, that kind of go hand in hand is that when you can see 1, 2, 3, 4, this is what I'm doing, you can start to make it better by seeing it. It's like once you see your workout regimen, you can say, oh, I need to do more leg day.\
\
[00:03:54.130] - Layla\
I actually know nothing about a gym. I don't know why I use that metaphor. But you get the idea because you can then add some stuff into that.\
\
[00:04:01.240] - Liz\
And I think it also makes it easier when you're batching. Because as much as we all love to be like, oh, yeah, I'm publishing both that day, so I'm going to sit down and write that day, life happens. And I think those within who are watching other subpositions are going to realize that batching is important. And so, if you're trying to create multiple pieces of content at the same time and you are using your assembly line, there's a lot of moving people. You've got four times, say four posts, trying to figure out the next step and get organized. How do you, I know, I'm going to ask you to explain how you, ClickUp would help with that, it is a free tool, guys. This isn't just like, go buy this tool, this is, I use it in big part because of all help I got for [inaudible 00:04:44]. But how would you kind of help them figure out that step to sort of get organized with it?\
\
[00:04:53.310] - Layla\
Yeah, I have a quick up demo account here open if we want to show some of this. But I'll just say at like high level, write down your four steps. Right? And if you know that those are your four steps for right now, where you're at, add all of those four posts you want to do per month. Put them in there, so you can see them and you can see the four steps in ClickUp if that's the tool we're using, or any tool. You can put your four steps that you have on your piece of paper or in your sticky notes, you can put them in there. And so, then you're taking this thing that you know you need to do and getting it out of your head and into something visual. So, you can see, I've got four posts, four steps per post, I've got 16 things I need to do. All of a sudden, we've made it visual for just tracking the stuff that we are already doing. So that mental load is not in our brain. We can spare our creativity for not remembering, oh, what post was I working on? No, our creativity can be spent on actually writing the post and adding that original kind of injection.\
\
[00:05:48.640] - Liz\
Okay. So, sort of the follow up to that is when you're kind of creating that content. Obviously, it's great for blog posts, but how do you then take kind of that organization method and use it to create more content or repurpose that content? How does that go hand in hand? Because it can get, I think, very messy very quickly.\
\
[00:06:09.040] - Layla\
Yes. You know, I think the way I would say to do it. Let's go the easiest approach, let's go back to those sticky notes. Let's say we've got our five steps. We just sit in our chair, we write thing, go on. When you are reaching a point where you want to repurpose, which I imagine throughout the summit, people are going to be like, oh, my gosh, I need to repurpose like this or like that. The thing we start with is, all right, where does that fall into the four things I already do? Let's add step five now, is to make one social media post using a quote from my blog post. That's just a match, and that's the strategy. We add that in a step five. And if we're using a task management system of some kind, we add that also, we add that fifth task or that fifth status, depending on how we're organizing things. And that's how we remember to do that next step. Yeah. Step one is deciding you want that to be your process. Step two is putting it in your tool. Step three, you just have to do it then. And my recommendation for folks when they're getting into repurposing is to take it in a measured approach.\
\
[00:07:10.620] - Layla\
So, like any process, don't change 50 things at once because you won't know what broke it. Let's lay your things.\
\
[00:07:17.960] - Liz\
Yeah. So, I think that example is great, especially when you're going from a blog post to a written piece content like a social media post. But what if you want to go to a completely different format? Do you want to turn that into a podcast episode or a YouTube video, and there's not any recorded component to it when you're writing the blog post?\
\
[00:07:39.190] - Layla\
You know I think when we're starting with a blog, we are a little bit limited in the fact that if we want to take it into the audio-visual side of things, we have to do a little bit more work versus if we start with rich content, it's easier to strip it down. But I think let's ask ourselves if we want to turn our blog post into podcast episodes, let's say that's our thing. For you, in your skill sets, what would you need to do in order to do it? Okay, I would need to sit down and read out my blog post, perhaps. I would probably need to create some kind of cover image or episode description. Big boom. Boom, boom. Okay, so I need to do three things every time I finish a blog post in order to do this type of repurposing, which is really like additional creation. So, then those become additional steps or additional statuses in the flow that we built out. And it's really just a matter of deciding, realizing what it involves by learning from experts or from trying it and seeing what you need to do and then working that into your assembly line for the next time around.\
\
[00:08:40.760] - Liz\
Yeah. And I will say, even if you don't kind of get the assembly line into your task management right away, having it written down somewhere, so that at some point you're like, oh, I need to go add those in. Big help. Big help. I've learned that the hard way.\
\
[00:08:55.540] - Layla\
I think that's so huge. I used to work with folks like pre, you know, precovid, pre, everyone was always online, and I remember telling folks like, hey, do you have a piece of paper? And we would write down the 50 things they had to do for every client. And I kid you not, for one particular client, we would make copies of the piece of paper with the checklist on it. And that repeating piece of paper added so much value just by knowing, what do I do next and where is each of my clients at? I don't think it needs to be fancy to work, which I'm so glad you pointed that out.\
\
[00:09:23.790] - Liz\
Yeah. So, I run this big summit once a year. I did do a mini-summit last year in September, but it had a lot of the same components as the regular summit. And I was like, wait, how do I set up a private podcast feed again? And so, I wrote it down this time, so that this year for this summit, I don't have to go refigure it out. So, yeah.\
\
[00:09:43.990] - Layla\
And it's so amazing that your story right there for anyone listening, you didn't wait until you had it perfectly figured out. The first time you just did it, and then you wrote down what you did, and then you use that. I feel like so many folks are like, I can't repurpose anything until I know exactly what I need to do. But I think that uncertainty that you were willing to go out there and try you know to do that thing or to explore how to repurpose.\
\
[00:10:07.090] - Liz\
Well, I've done it before but it had been nine months and I didn't remember how, you know.\
\
[00:10:11.140] - Layla\
Okay, so there's also that.\
\
[00:10:12.810] - Liz\
So, it was like, okay, I need to maybe just write this down, so each time I'm not having to go figure it out because I don't do it that often. So, yeah, same idea though. And it was just down there, you wrote it on piece of paper and then, you know, typed it up and took up. And I'll make it better, all I had screenshots, you know, but basic steps are there, so I'm not trying to figure it out by going back a bit of time. What are the settings on that old one that I did? Yeah.\
\
[00:10:41.660] - Layla\
Absolutely.\
\
[00:10:44.360] - Liz\
Okay, so we've talked about kind of the assembly line. We've talked about the workflow. As bloggers grow, there's more to do, which means you are looking at automation, delegation and elimination, which is if you guys haven't watched Stephanie Blake's session, we talked about that. But automation and delegation, I think are two of the hardest things to do, but two of the most useful because I know I didn't really get systems in place until I needed someone else to help me with things and it was really hard and she was like, you're not giving me the tools I need to succeed here. And I'm like, okay, I'm working on it. So, how would you suggest people get started with that? Obviously, if you've got something going that's mild ahead of a lot of people, but where do you suggest they start approaching those kind of options?\
\
[00:11:38.890] - Layla\
Yeah, I think first of all, let's all just share the fact that there's a point where we're all unsystemized and just winging things and just writing blog. Can we start with that? Like understanding that let's get rid of the guilt layer. That would be step one because we've all been in that position and some of you guys watching might be in that position. That's cool. We're all there at some point. So, beyond that, step two will say, I would start your journey by making sure you know what your assembly line is, which I know this kind of sounds like I'm repeating what was before, but I can't tell you how many times I've seen folks hire, setup automations, build fancy templates, only to realize that they hired somebody for something they don't actually want to do or they don't know why they're doing or they don't think it's on brand for them to do. So, my 1st/2nd step would be to take a moment and look at your piece of paper or your sticky notes or whatever you have and just say, hey, is this what I like? Is this aligned with my brand?\
\
[00:12:37.600] - Layla\
Am I doing this just because some influencer told me to? Or does this actually feel like what my blog is all about? If you can say, yep, yep, yep, everything I'm doing here is essential and necessary, where I usually tell folks to go in. Next is to look at what areas of your process, given that they're all necessary, that you know, that they're all aligned, what is something that is, for lack of better words, inhuman. That's where I would go next. Typically that automation layer is more cost-efficient and easier if you have a solid process. And that's where I would suggest people start by using templates and automation tools.\
\
[00:13:16.310] - Liz\
Okay, let's get into some specifics of automation tools and maybe even just a couple of examples of what sort of an inhuman task would be, just cause I think that really helps people to better understand if they've gotten examples.\
\
[00:13:29.310] - Layla\
Yeah. Do you mind if I share my screen?\
\
[00:13:30.840] - Liz\
Oh, no, that's great.\
\
[00:13:32.520] - Layla\
Okay, fabulous. Well, let's just see if I can actually do that. This is a true test, which one am I clicking on? All right. Can you see this lovely blanks ClickUp screen right here?\
\
[00:13:41.350] - Liz\
Yes, I can.\
\
[00:13:42.420] - Layla\
Okay. So I wanted to give you a visual because sometimes I think that helps. It makes sense. The first automation I would suggest that anybody does is what I would call templating. This is kind of an automation, but mostly just writing things down in a very basic way. But let's just say, you have your assembly line, you know, it's all valuable. What I would suggest is, and this is just a YouTube example, but the same goes for blogging or any other form of content, write down your steps. Once you have this, use a piece of technology to template your steps and I'm demonstrating this in ClickUp, but really any tool has this. \
\
[00:14:20.080] - Liz\
Trello, Asana, they all have, yeah.\
\
[00:14:22.450] - Layla\
Even email these days, right? So, whatever you have, it probably has this. Or duplicate your Google Doc and then set up an automation that allows you to say, hey, when I have a new blog post, I know I want to write, apply this template. You want the beginner automation every single creator needs. When my task is created, apply a template. I'm demonstrating this in ClickUp. But again, any tool you have is going to get close to this in some way, whether it's done by a technology or even done by a VA. Maybe we could quasi manual automation to have that whole pipeline, that whole process be created for you.\
\
[00:15:03.710] - Liz\
Yeah, I don't even think about that being an automation because that's already automated so long ago for me. That's a great point. So, I'm like, oh yeah, mine just does that and that's great.\
\
[00:15:16.840] - Layla\
That's the first one.\
\
[00:15:17.600] - Liz\
Yes, yes. I think the other one is like sometimes creating graphics can be a little more automated and that's my other place that I always try to add stuff. But yeah, the number of automations I have set up in ClickUp for this summit and managing speakers, I was like, couldn't have done it without all the learning things from you. And I still have to tweak some things, but it's going pretty well. I'm quite pleased, I've got to say. The further down you get in the line, guys, the much more complicated and crazy it can get, but also simpler and what you are actually having to do.\
\
[00:15:48.510] - Layla\
Exactly. Because you're like automating little problems rather than big problems at that point.\
\
[00:15:54.130] - Liz\
Yeah, yeah. I think one of the best things I do is you'll kind of notice you had to do a secret intake form as part of my process, and then based on answers in that form, it sent out a different email with next steps. So, you knwo I'm not onboarding the speakers manually, which I have done many years past.\
\
[00:16:17.960] - Layla\
You had to start there.\
\
[00:16:19.410] - Liz\
Yeah, yeah. And this is someone this is my fourth year doing this, and I'm really just getting, like every year my process, I always think I've got a process in place, and then I'm like, well, that didn't quite work as well as I'd hoped, so let's try something else. And I've tried different tech, you know and so it's a constant changing and updating and seeing what works. Okay. So, yeah. I didn't even think about that being an automation.\
\
[00:16:46.310] - Layla\
Well, you asked for beginner. That's the one that's gonna be the low hanging clue.\
\
[00:16:48.630] - Liz\
It did. You are absolutely right. No, it is. And I've just become reobsessed with ClickUp and all the different automations you can do, and email templates for quick responses and things. So, yeah. So, definitely look at whatever tool you're using and make sure you're taking full advantage of the features that offer for whatever plan you're on, I think just a general piece of advice. Okay. What are some places you see people get hung up on when it comes to trying to get organized and systemized in their content creation?\
\
[00:17:22.990] - Layla\
Yeah. So, I give some thought to this question because you know I do content creation, but I've also worked with folks who are bloggers by trading on multiple blogs and that's kind of like their thing. They're a blogging house, for lack of a better word. And I think one of the most recurrent themes I see across all scales of content creators, including the higher end, is having a hard time separating keyword research or idea selection from creation, particularly if it's an agency or a team model. But even if it's just you, I think it all scales. I see that as a recurrent challenge, and that applies to work in general, but particularly with content where that shiny new idea is the one you want to start working on, or that keyword that looks like a hot opportunity, you want to fast track it, but you have a hard time dividing. You know how many ideas can I handle at once? How can I reach the 50 posts I need to get out this month if I keep derailing based on something coming up? So, for me, that's resolved by separating those two things.\
\
[00:18:27.340] - Liz\
Okay. And by separate, do you mean like, you only do keyword research, you know the first week of the month, and then you're done with it for the month or you know every other month or something? How does separating that actually look like in terms of the tasks that they do?\
\
[00:18:44.060] - Layla\
Yeah. So, let's say, let's talk about tasks and the specific pieces of it. In terms of the cadence, right, monthly, weekly, daily, whatever, I think that will depend on the scale you're at and what you're going for. You know trends is different than evergreen, and I think we need to leave space for that. But when it comes to the practicalities, when you have key phrases that you're trying to target and you have blog posts that you think are going to relate to those key phrases, the easiest thing we can do, technically speaking, is keep these as separate entities. So, if we're using Airtable, let's make a database of key phrases and a database of blog posts. They are not the same thing. If you're using ClickUp, we've got a key phrase list, we've got a blog post list, and we can view these as two separate things that can be happening separately in separate areas that can be connected together, but aren't necessarily one and the same. That's usually what I see succeed more in separating things, is having your research over here, your action over here, and you're able to work on them independently without them being all on top of each other.\
\
[00:19:48.640] - Liz\
Okay. Yeah, I think what I have is I have like a running list of keywords, and then I use a relationship to my blog post, so I can see what keywords I supposed to be using for this post idea. So, yeah, no. Blogging is an addictive thing, and then once you start one and there's another, and now I'm up to four, and I don't know how many domains I own.\
\
[00:20:13.390] - Layla\
And then your writers under you, and you're like, wait, which writer is doing this one? Like separating that out like you have it is just such a smart way to allow you to be creative. But make sure you're hitting those marks that you need to hit.\
\
[00:20:25.540] - Liz\
Okay. And you touched on this a little bit earlier where you talked about sort of outsourcing and automating things you don't want to do. I wonder if you can maybe dive into that, because sometimes the thing you don't want to do is create a system, but sometimes you find it's just a specific assembly line you want to avoid. Like, how do you kind of force past that and then make it a solution that works for you? How would you kind of give advice on that?\
\
[00:20:51.340] - Layla\
Yeah, I think a lot of the hate that comes with like building a workflow is because we always think of it in terms of this boring factory sense, or maybe that's just me, but that was always my connotation with systems and processes. It's a boring factory thing for, like, engineers and quants to worry about, and everyone else is just inflicted upon them. But I think what we need to reframe this as is process or your assembly line is your internal brand. I mean, it's the recipe for the pizza, you know, and you're known for your pizza. So, like, we should care about the recipe if we can reframe it in that way first. All of a sudden, this whole process conversation talks about how can we make sure our blog always feels and sounds like us, even if we get someone else to help. It's creative. It's not restrictive. So, with that mindset in terms of how to go about it, I would look at your pieces of your assembly line and find the thing that is, I would say, the least value for you doing it, but at the same time, it's going to contribute to the bottom line, meaning move the piece forward, get the blog published.\
\
[00:21:59.520] - Layla\
Anything that doesn't fill you up could be something delegated, but I have to push back that. I don't think the system piece is one of it. Do you really want some other chef to define the recipe of your pizza when you're known for your pizza? Come on.\
\
[00:22:13.210] - Liz\
Yeah. Yeah. And I think one thing I heard, I forget what book or person said this is, like, if you can find someone to do the task at least 80% as well as you, can outsource it. If it's not something you absolutely love doing, like it's not worth kind of you doing it.\
\
[00:22:31.610] - Layla\
Especially with content creation and repurposing, I think there's a lot of pieces that I mean, you can be a great writer, but does that necessarily mean you're going to be the greatest at putting a featured image on the post? I think we're all, like, we all think we're amazing and we all are amazing, but we don't have to be amazing at everything, every moment of every day. That's exhausting.\
\
[00:22:52.240] - Liz\
Yes. You know and I think I don't know if this was inside the membership or if it on your YouTube channel, guys, go subscribe to her YouTube channel, by the way, you will learn a ton. But for example, when you create a YouTube video, you're recording it because it's your face, but that doesn't mean you have to edit, transcribe, upload it, do the graphics, you know. Those things are things that don't require you and can be systemized, you know and given out to other people. Yeah.\
\
[00:23:17.830] - Layla\
Who are generally better at it. Like, can we just put that elephant in the room? I mean, we're all afraid that it's going to go down in quality, but generally speaking, if you can, like, just do what you're good at, we all need, like, a humility pill. Like, oh, yeah, I'm actually not the best at editing, out. You know, I think that's the piece that's nice about it too.\
\
[00:23:34.320] - Liz\
Yeah. Yes. Okay. So, any other places you see people get hung up on besides keyword research, that I think it's just as important to learn other mistakes as it is to learn kind of what to do. So, what are some other mistakes that you see people making a lot?\
\
[00:23:50.520] - Layla\
Waiting till things are perfect, that would be my second one. So, we have never written one blog post, but we need to make sure we have a 50 piece repurposing chain because I watched the Gary Vee episode before I could do anything.\
\
[00:24:05.740] - Liz\
Yes. I don't know. Okay, I'm going to call everyone watching this session, but if you've not published your blog yet, publish it.\
\
[00:24:15.910] - Liz\
Put one post out there. You don't need to start with ten or 15 or 20 or whatever. Like, if you can write, but don't you're procrastinating? Just go hit publish.\
\
[00:24:26.590] - Layla\
Yeah. I think [inaudible 00:24:27] \
\
[00:24:27.520] - Liz\
Procrastination by perfection.\
\
[00:24:30.340] - Layla\
I would say that's the number two thing. Procrast a planning, I sometimes call it, because we spend the time, like, moving boxes around and making our perfect assembly line. And it's like [crosstalk 00:24:39]...\
\
[00:24:39.610] - Liz\
The website.\
\
[00:24:41.210] - Layla\
Tweaking the website, the logo, the colors. In my world, it's like adding 50 steps of repurposing. That's just like, oh, man.\
\
[00:24:49.540] - Liz\
Yes.\
\
[00:24:50.530] - Layla\
Improve your process by doing it. And that goes for most specifically, I think, for folks you said, where they might be worried about delegation. Procrast a planning around delegation is huge. So, you know let's say, I want to hire somebody to help me edit my posts. Like, I can't edit my own work, I just want to hire an editor. Well, if I was procrast a planning, I would obsess over the fact that I don't have a perfect checklist for everything to check for when editing. It's not perfect yet. And so, I can't possibly hire an editor. That's kind of silly because you're going to procrastinate, procrastinate, it will be two years until we get an editor when the editor would have given us time back.\
\
[00:25:28.600] - Liz\
Yeah.\
\
[00:25:29.590] - Layla\
So, my switch on that is get enough done. Get enough. And then bring that person in and learn from them. Learn from each other. Build the thing as you need it and not wait for it to be perfect.\
\
[00:25:41.620] - Liz\
Yeah, because especially if you hire the right person, contractor, employee, or whatever, they can tell you, hey, if they're not getting the result you want, then that's a conversation with them, hey, what else do you need to be able to get to that point? Or they will say, hey, I don't have all the tools I need, if that's the result you're expecting. So, if you're hiring the right person that's willing to kind of speak up and be like. You haven't done your job fully yet for me to do mine, which can make a big difference. Especially when you're used to being just you, you don't realize how much stuff is in your head that needs to get out for someone else to do as well. Or at least 80% as well as you do.\
\
[00:26:19.910] - Layla\
Absolutely. And that can be a conversation. It doesn't have to be you the expert having everything ready. Like, they can ask you, hey, Liz, where do I go to find this? And then you say, oh, here's the link and then you have it for next time. It's okay if it evolves like that, it doesn't make you a bad blogger or anything to let it grow.\
\
[00:26:37.010] - Liz\
Yes. Because you're already learning so many skills when it comes to blogging. Like, learning how to outsource, manage is just another skill to learn and takes time.\
\
[00:26:46.840] - Layla\
Yeah. practice.\
\
[00:26:47.240] - Liz\
Okay, so any final words? Any final tips you want to give our attendees?\
\
[00:26:54.260] - Layla\
I would just say don't be afraid to practice. It's a skill to build. Everyone can build it. You're not too type B or too creative. Like, creativity and systems are not mutually exclusive. We can all learn the skill enough to be dangerous and that's all we really have to do.\
\
[00:27:08.620] - Liz\
Okay, I love it. And where can our attendees find you if they want to learn more, if they want to start obsessing over things? Because that is what happens when you follow Layla.\
\
[00:27:20.960] - Layla\
We're going to rebrand processes to be fun one of these days, I swear. They can find out more info at processdriven.co/bbs. And we've got like a free training and stuff for you guys here that I think will help you take the next step. If you want to geek out about this stuff, like, we are here.\
\
[00:27:36.130] - Liz\
Yes, definitely go check it out. It's really, the mindset shift alone, I think, because I think that's where I started was like your free workshop and then I was like, yeah, I need this. And it's been so helpful, guys. My ClickUp and everything was a mess and I never really bothered paying attention to it and it's, yeah, game changer. So, Layla, again, thank you so much. This is so helpful. I hope everyone goes and checks out that training. Just, thanks again, I appreciate it.\
\
[00:28:03.430] - Layla\
Yeah, thank you for having me. And good luck, everybody. I'm filling out those proceeds.\

[00:00:00.000] - Michelle Pontvert\
Hi, welcome to "Taking Action in the Right Direction." I'm Michelle Pontvert and I'm super excited to be talking about this today because I really, really, truly believe that taking action has made the biggest difference in my business, but is also kind of the secret weapon behind actually building a business you enjoy because you focus on momentum rather than that big, lofty end goal that you may have in mind, and that's totally fine. But I'm here to really encourage you to take some big, bold, brave action today. So as I mentioned, hi, I'm Michelle Pontvert or Pont-Vert if that French pronunciation is a little tricky. I really do think that my biggest superpower in business and kind of in life is that I'm just really good at doing stuff, like getting things done. Not to say I'm very talented at a lot of the things I try, but I love me a good checklist. I have never met a deadline that I did not actually never think about because I do things before the deadlines come up, but they don't stand a chance of getting missed in my books. And my hyperfocused skills, thanks to my neuro-spiciness, are something truly to be marveled at when they do engage.\
\
[00:01:31.740] - Michelle\
I've learned over a lifetime of doing stuff that, not surprising to maybe you but to me, that doing things is how things get done, that basically moving is how we move forward. I'm not here to advocate that you overwork, that you buckle down, that you do the hard things, that you just work for the sake of working. But what I am going to be talking about and what I'm super excited to share is that leaning into doing things you like in the way that you like them can really make the difference in actually getting you where you want to go. So basically, I want to help you lean into that excitement and that internal momentum that you have naturally as a human to make things happen in a way that is a lot easier for you, and that gets you where you want to go. So, I always like to preview what I'm going to be talking about. Here's a high-level of what we're going to be covering. First, I'm going to be talking about why mindset and strategy, which is very popular in this online business world, can sometimes get in the way of doing the doing. Then I'm going to be basically raving about how action-taking truly is the key to moving you forward. Then we're going to dive into gut checking to make sure that you're going in the right direction. Then I'm going to leave you with four questions to get your action-taking going in the right direction.\
\
[00:03:03.340] - Michelle\
Okay, let's get started. So, why the mindset and strategy stuff can sometimes get in the way. Particularly in this online business world, but honestly, in most places where we're trying to build something on our own, a lot of weight and a lot of energy, time, money gets invested in helping you master your mindset, like get yourself in the right space mentally and then figuring out, scoring the right strategy, figuring out the how to do things the right way. And both of those are super important parts of building a business ultimately, but I'm going to take Devil's advocate here today and argue that they aren't actually the big piece that you should be focusing on most of the time to get to your version of success. Basically, I think they're a bit over-inflated, and I'm here to share why I think they get over-inflated.\
\
[00:04:01.050] - Michelle\
Here's what I see and I'm 100% guilty of this too, so don't worry. Here's what I see happening as most people try and build their business or grow as they've actually got a business started. You have an idea. It's an idea you're super excited about and you love it, you want to get started like yesterday. These can be all sorts of ideas. I'm talking about things as small as a piece of content you want to create and something as big as a whole new offer, even the direction of your business. But there is a spark. Something has lit you up. And then what happens, usually, is we start to have some wobbles. We start to feel some feelings about this idea and start to maybe question ourselves, wondering if our audience, the people we have looking at what we're doing, maybe won't like it. Maybe you don't even have enough people in your audience anyway to pull this thing off. Maybe if it doesn't work you could have wasted your time, which is something you're very conscious of as a solo-business owner and, definitely, if you've got all the big-life stuff going on like I do and a lot of people in my world do.\
\
[00:05:11.460] - Michelle\
Maybe some inferiority complex comes in and we start to worry that we're not qualified to do the thing in the first place and that maybe even someone might judge you for doing it. You get the idea. Basically, we get stuck in this analysis paralysis space where we're just worried and anxiously questioning the idea. And all of that great momentum you'd built up with the spark, the idea, stops. It just grinds to a halt as we start to dive into those big, big questions, start to question our mindset, question our strategies. And some of those things are super valid. I don't want to bash mindset work. I don't want to bash strategy. Those are really important and valid. And some of these questions are important and valid. I personally struggle a lot with rejection-sensitive dysphoria and I know a lot of this even if it isn't the scale that maybe we feel it at, is still coming from somewhere real.\
\
[00:06:13.750] - Michelle\
But what happens, regardless of how real or not those questions are, is that we put a pause on the idea to start working on some of this bigger stuff, to examine those strategies, work on the mindset, and sometimes often start to outsource the decision-making of whether to do this idea and how to do this idea to other people. And this is where we often see people getting stuck in using other people's frameworks, going through a lot of working on ourselves, working on 'the big picture', and it pulls you out of actually doing the doing. Often this comes from, again, really understandable places. This comes from those bigger-picture questions sometimes seeming safer or smarter, or just easier in a weird way than actually doing the hard thing and doing the doing. Because what you're creating, what your idea is, is unknown. And sometimes we can't know it. How it's going to turn out is something unknowable until we've tried it, and that's really scary especially if you have other life stuff going on. If you've lived a life that causes you to question things, or if you've been born with a brain that tells you to question things. The result of all of this questioning is that you can start talking yourself out of the idea and fall out of love with it. You'll start to see the cracks, see the potential pitfalls, see the work you maybe need to do on yourself, the things you need to learn, the things you need to do before you can actually do the doing of this very first spark of an idea.\
\
[00:08:00.780] - Michelle\
Ultimately, what truly ends up happening is nothing. Sure, you may be working on some big, big stuff, really working on figuring yourself out, figuring out your big picture. But let's get to brass tacks. Nothing's happening to move that idea forward. You won't have created anything new. People won't know about it, so you won't know if they're going to like it. We don't ultimately know if it's going to work. We've just been thinking. After all of this, I feel like most of the time and myself very much included, you start to feel even more stuck now because you've added these extra hurdles in your way of doing the doing and moving forward. Basically, by trying to outthink ourselves we actually get in a way of doing things to show ourselves what's possible, and what could happen.\
\
[00:08:56.690] - Michelle\
I don't love sitting in the negative, so let's flip the switch and I'm going to talk about what can happen when we start leaning into just taking action. Honestly, the point of all of this is that we can't get anywhere without trying, without doing something, if you sit still. A body in motion will keep moving. If you sit still it's very unlikely that things are going to move forward for you, particularly move forward in a way that you want them to. That's why I'm here to advocate for, cheerlead, that first gut reaction, that step-one I mentioned, the spark, the excitement, the motivation, the momentum that sometimes comes with the new and the shiny. I'm a big fan of chasing the shiny. In my joint business with my business bestie, created entirely on the whim, we have a membership called the "Shiny Squirrel Chasers." I'm not going to hide. I love me some shiny. But it's because ultimately behind that shiny, behind that excitement is movement. It is momentum and it is something that helps you take action. And taking action is truly the only way to make things happen in your business. They're not going to happen for you. Now I know that doesn't come as easily for some of us as it does for others, and it's super understandable. As I said we've all lived life. We've got experiences of traumas and neural pathways that have taught us to mask, to shrink, to hide, to play it safe, because we needed to stay safe as people. But as business owners, we do need to step out of being the squishy humans that we are sometimes and start putting our CEO hats on, and start deciding what we want to do with this business that we control, that we get to decide, and how do you want to change that?\
\
[00:10:53.440] - Michelle\
So, here's my question to you. What do you want to do? Like with your days, with your time, with your life, with your business, that is ultimately maybe not fully in your control, but something that you get to decide. And you get to decide what feels controllable. Yes, sometimes we can't control the weather, we can't control taxes, we can't control a lot of things in life. But in our business there are things we do control, and I think we give up that control fairly easily in the face of fear. What feels doable? What is something you can manage? You have the skills, tools, equipment, space, capacity to do. What feels exciting? What feels motivating? Basically, I'm trying to provoke you to think about the things that maybe are standing in your way just because they kept you safe, but aren't actually helping you get where you want to be going and live the life that maybe does feel safer, does feel happier, does feel richer. So, I want to encourage you to ask yourself how you could lean more into the things that you do want to be doing, that you do want to feel excited about, get that momentum going, because ultimately it is up to you to make this business work, and it's up to you how you want this business to feel.\
\
[00:12:21.380] - Michelle\
This is my thesis of my business journey, of my whole deal, is that I am pretty sure if you spend more time doing things you like, that you're excited about, playing with ideas, feeling excitement, and generally enjoying the time you put into your work, the day-to-day, the hour-to-hour, the minute-to-minute, it's all going to feel a lot better. And not just that's a good thing, we want you to feel better, but that good feeling, that excitement, that enthusiasm, that momentum shows. People can see it. They can see when you're excited. They can see when you're energized. They can see when this isn't just a mundane thing you had to do, but that's something you really wanted to do. You put some of you in it, you put your heart in it, and that attracts the right people. That gets them excited about what you're doing. Ultimately, they want to pay you to get a part of that excitement because it does feel good and they can see it. At the core of it all, if you're listening to this, you are creating something that other people need to be excited about.\
\
[00:13:30.740] - Michelle\
And it's really hard to convince them to be excited if you're not. Ultimately, it comes down to that. Let's not lose focus on what it is we're sharing here, and that is energy, enthusiasm, excitement, motivation, momentum, passion! That's what's so compelling and something I think we lose track of. Here's something that while coming off my soapbox of like, "You should do more exciting, shiny things," I want to give you a realistic reality of how this actually looks. And sometimes you do start doing something that you're excited about. You do go all in. You do put aside the overanalysis, the getting your mindset and strategies and all that stuff right, and you just start doing. And I think it's only fair that we address what to do when it starts to not feel so good anymore, when something doesn't feel quite right after you have started doing the doing. And sometimes it's because we're just overworked or stimulated or just tired. That's super fair. Life is hard. And I do have some tips to help you moving again if it's literally just a motivation problem. But in the meantime, I think those feelings of stuckness can be really, really helpful because they can tell you why you're not moving in the right direction, or they can flag to you that you aren't moving in the right direction.\
\
[00:15:08.940] - Michelle\
Some of the things that it could be flagging to this feeling of things not being quite right are that maybe you've built something that people like, that gets a good reaction, but you're not actually that keen on doing or delivering. This looks a lot like you've built an offer that sells well that you hate doing, or you've built some content that people really like but you don't want to keep talking about. It's that mismatch between the external positive feedback and your own internal feeling of how you actually want to keep doing this. Sometimes the idea, the spark has morphed into something that doesn't fit you as a human anymore. So sometimes this is, you had this idea for a big marketing idea, a big venture you're going to put on an event, you're going to create a podcast or something. And slowly in the process of doing it, it's morphed into something that doesn't actually make sense for you as a human. You've built a schedule that doesn't work for your life. You've created a framework that you don't actually fit that well. You're asking yourself to do work that doesn't fit you. Let's say you hate going live and you've suddenly created an entire system where you have to go live every day. It happens. It happens to the best of us. And sometimes it's just that you don't have the capacity to continue doing this thing. Maybe it's not the right time. Maybe it's not the right fit for you as a human. I have a limited capacity in terms of time and also just energy capacity. Sometimes as much as you love something, as much as I can fall in love with an idea, as I start doing it I realize it just demands more than I have to give, and that happens. And it's okay. It's actually a really good sign that you're feeling that feeling, because when things start to get a little prickly, get a little uncomfortable, that's your best asset as a business owner. That's, again, putting that CEO hat back on.\
\
[00:17:09.540] - Michelle\
That's the thing you need to pay attention to. We need to pay attention to the spark, and we need to pay attention to the prickle. And when things start prickling, that's where the gut checks come in. Because gut checking with yourself is how you realign, how you make sure you're doing things in the right direction. You're moving where you want to be going. So here is how I use gut checking. I encourage you to explore how it looks for you. But gut checking is basically checking in with yourself to see if this idea still truly lights you up. Are you still excited about it? Do you want to keep doing it, or not? And that's okay too. We need to be really honest with ourselves when doing this gut check. Then be really critical of like, hey, did something go off the rails? We just need to adjust it to get back on course, get back to something we like doing. Or is it maybe just not the right fit and it's time to let it go? Because you can't do everything and we shouldn't be trying to do everything, and letting things go can sometimes be the most strategic, the most powerful decision you can make. And it's your job as that CEO of your business to decide what things are worth doing, again, chasing that shiny or not, and which things you want to let go. And that, if you can do it, is what helps you keep yourself on track, keeps you doing the things that light you up and, building the momentum in your business because you carve out space intentionally to do things you enjoy doing and not keep things that you don't like or can't keep up.\
\
[00:18:51.590] - Michelle\
So, all of this to say, I'm going to leave you with these questions because this is super personal to you, your business, your life. But I think it's really important to pose these questions to yourself. So, what do you love doing in your business? What tasks? What type of work? How do you like to work? What does a good day look like in your business work? Or what isn't a good day? Really start to take stock. Take stock of what feels good in your body, in your brain, in your mood. What helps you feel like you're doing work you enjoy? So what do you love doing in your business? Then the second question is, what gets in the way of you doing more of that? Is it, again, like I mentioned, the mindset stuff, the strategy stuff, using other people's frameworks? Is that a lot of 'should do' this and 'I meant to do' that kind of thinking? Is it time and capacity and you need to start examining and gut checking some of the other things you're doing so that you can clear some space for the things you love? And then how can you do more of it?\
\
[00:20:07.290] - Michelle\
As I said, it's really up to you to decide what you let in or push out of your CEO space as a business owner. You get to decide how you want this to go. So, how can you make more space for the things you love? How can you orchestrate it so that you get to spend more of your precious time and energy doing things that light you up rather than suck your energy? And then other things you're already doing in your business, what in your day-to-day, your hour-to-hour, your minute-to-minute work are you doing that might need a gut check? What are the things that are starting to feel that prickle, that discomfort that's worth paying attention to? When we start something new, there's always going to be a period of things feeling a bit sticky, a bit tricky, and that's fine and worth paying attention to, but often worth persevering if the thing we're really excited about is really worth pursuing. The excitement is still there, so it's worth moving through that. But if it's just feeling sticky, it's time for it to be evaluated and potentially go.\
\
[00:21:15.200] - Michelle\
Ultimately, I think with these four questions in mind, this is how you build a business that you not only love and enjoy but ultimately again, has that spark that other people are drawn to, that brings you the audience, that brings you the people and the money that help you keep going, that help you grow, that help you build the momentum to keep doing more of the things you love.\
\
[00:21:39.910] - Michelle\
Okay, so I did mention earlier on that you have sometimes just a motivation issue when you're doing that gut check and things are starting to feel a bit prickly. Sometimes it's just because motivation is eluding you. So I put together a free resource that has my five best tips for getting yourself moving when you can't just bully yourself into doing it. So, it is called "My Unsticking Tricks," and it is my out-of-the-box ideas to help you get moving and avoid bullying yourself straight to burnout because trust me, I've done that too, and it does not work. I would love to encourage you to sign up for that. Get those things to keep you moving on the things you ultimately do love and maybe just need a little nudge to get going. You could find that at my website, michellepontvert.com/unstuck. Thank you so much for sticking around. I really hope I've motivated you to enjoy your tasks more, to lean into some fun, some enjoyment, some spark, and give those prickly feelings the space and time they need because they are trying to tell you something, and I want you to be in the driver's seat of your own business.\
\
[00:22:55.630] - Michelle\
Thank you so much, and if this resonated with you I'd absolutely love to connect further. I'm the only Michelle Pontvert out there, so I'm pretty easy to find. I'm on Facebook, Instagram, and always on my website. I absolutely love connecting with anybody who resonates with the Pollyanna- enthusiasm I have about doing business your way, and building a business that you truly love and that fits your real life. Thank you.\

Welcome to Stop Working Harder. I am so excited that you are here at this session because this is such an important message and skill to learn. But before we get started, I wanted to take a moment to introduce myself to you. Hello. I'm Rebekah Lara.\
\
[00:00:32.740] - Rebakah\
I am the owner of Rebekah Lara Virtual Solutions, where I am a productivity coach, an online business manager, and Asana certified pro, which if you're not familiar with Asana, it's a digital project management tool that has saved my sanity. And I just couldn't recommend it more highly. I'm also the creator of the course Save Your Sanity with Asana, which is why I say that where I teach other people how to save their sanity because running an online business can be challenging, especially when you're a mom like me.\
\
[00:01:09.730] - Rebakah\
And we are not only running an online business but also raising a family, raising our children. And I'm the mother of three young ladies. They are the light of my life, and they also come with their own unique special needs.\
\
[00:01:26.920] - Rebakah\
All three of them have complex and chronic medical conditions and mental health issues. And my oldest daughter is a survivor of multiple organ failure. And I only share that with you because I want you to know that I have been in the trenches like literally at our lowest moment in our family. And slowly over the past three and a half years or so, I have climbed out of that and I am happy to report that my daughter has been recovering and is doing so much better. It is still a process.\
\
[00:02:06.500] - Rebakah\
She is still not 100%, and a lot of what I do is teach women and other parents how to fulfill their business dreams, their goals, and their businesses while also dealing with life's challenges.\
\
[00:02:24.300] - Rebakah\
So, you might not have the same challenges as I do with my daughter and all of their special needs. But I'm sure you have something that you can relate to, something that has gotten in the way. And so that is my passion. That is who I am. And I am happy to share some of the things I've learned sometimes the hard way along this journey.\
\
[00:02:49.050] - Rebakah\
So, I would love for you to start by asking yourself, why do you feel like you need to work hard? So, it could possibly be some of these reasons? Is it to feel worthy? Is it to be liked, liked by others, liked by your family, your spouse, your partner, your community, your colleagues? Is it to feel valuable? Sometimes I hear that we don't feel valuable unless we're doing something or helping someone else. Or is it to make more money?\
\
[00:03:29.330] - Rebakah\
This is a common belief. I hear a lot as well. And in order to make more money and support ourselves and support our families, we need to be working harder to do that. But I challenge you to really stop and think about this. How does this make you feel?\
\
[00:03:49.890] - Rebakah\
I'm also wondering, how is it influencing your mood and your desire to work on your business? A lot of times I hear my clients tell me that it makes them not want to work on their business. They don't feel in quotes motivated to work on their business when they're feeling like they need to be working hard to be successful. That doesn't align with being motivated and wanting to wake up each day working on your blog, working on your business\
\
[00:04:22.530] - Rebakah\
Is it giving you energy or is it draining your energy? Please tell us in the chat box. It's really important to tune into yourself and figure out how you're feeling and how it's affecting your actions. Because a lot of times if we're feeling this way, we're feeling unmotivated and stressed and overwhelmed. It's not giving us the energy that we need or desire to work on our business or any part of our lives. Right? So, take a quick moment.\
\
[00:04:55.300] - Rebakah\
Tell us how you're feeling or what thoughts you're having about working harder in your business. The good news and the truth is that you don't have to work harder to be successful and make more money. Working longer, working harder and staying busier is not going to get you results faster. And I know that can seem counterintuitive. However, working longer, working harder and staying busier is just in my opinion, and in my experience going to lead to burnout, which is not going to get you the results that you want faster.\
\
[00:05:32.190] - Rebakah\
Instead focusing on the top 20% will.\
\
[00:05:37.170] - Rebakah\
And if you're not familiar with that term or that strategy, I want to introduce you to the Pareto principle. It's also known as the 80/20 rule. This principle guides all of my decisions to be honest every day now. Especially as a mom of three girls who have special needs and medical challenges, I don't have time to do everything. And this principle has taught me that the top 20% of my tasks will actually account for 80% of my results.\
\
[00:06:14.550] - Rebakah\
So let me say that again, the top 20% of your tasks will actually account for 80% of your results. So, as a business owner, as a blogger, you can sigh a big breath of relief that you don't have to actually do everything. You don't have to feel like you just need to keep turning out content and posts and logos and branding and all these things. Because really, only the top 20% of your tasks, meaning the things you do in your day during your week are going to be responsible for most of your results in your business and in your blog. \
\
[00:07:04.240] - Rebakah\
So that also means that 20% of your products, your paid offers will also account for 80% of your profits. So, if you know this, you can start focusing in and prioritizing those tasks and those products and those offers that are going to get you the most results and the most profit in your business while also not leading to stress, overwhelm, fatigue, and burnout.\
\
[00:07:41.010] - Rebakah\
Yet unfortunately, most people, including myself, I've been here too and still find myself falling into this trap. Sometimes most people avoid the 20% because those tasks are outside of their comfort zone, meaning they're the biggest tasks. They're the scariest. They're new. Perhaps they involve you learning a new skill or a new tool in order to do it.\
\
[00:08:12.050] - Rebakah\
And so a lot of times people will avoid doing those tasks, even though they're going to be the tasks and the projects that lead you to the results you desire because they are stopped by fear and overwhelm and the unknown. I, however, coach my clients on how to overcome those fears and how to overcome these thoughts and how to really focus on the top 20%, and we call that learning to eat that frog or eat your frog. There is a saying by Mark Twain. He actually has a quote about this, and I want to share that with you because then it will make more sense.\
\
[00:08:59.880] - Rebakah\
So, Mark Tracy once said, Eat a live frog first thing in the morning and nothing worse will happen to you the rest of the day, which that might seem like random.\
\
[00:09:12.090] - Rebakah\
Why am I sharing this with you? Well, there's this book that you can see here by Brian Tracy called Eat That Frog. And it's a really fantastic book about productivity and how to stop procrastinating and get more done in less time, which is my mission. And I love this book because it's short and it contains 21 really short chapters like three to four pages long. They give you practical actionable tips to learn to eat your frog. And so, from the perspective of Brian Tracy, the author, he is saying that sometimes those tasks that are in the top 20% that feel intimidating or overwhelming or make you a little bit scared and step outside of your comfort zone.\
\
[00:10:03.610] - Rebakah\
Those are your frogs, right? Because you know that they are the things that you need to do and that will move your business forward and get you those results that you desire. However, they're the things you don't really feel like doing or afraid to do. They are your frogs. So, what Mark Tracy is saying is if you have to eat a live frog, which sounds horrible, right?\
\
[00:10:29.090] - Rebakah\
Just like some of our business tasks feel like do it first thing in the morning, meaning the first thing you do in the day, and then you know that the rest of the day nothing worse is going to happen. You've already gotten that out of your way. And so, it also teaches you that to focus and prioritize and put those tasks first in your day because they are the most important and giving your energy to those top 20% will get you the results you desire. You do it first and you get it done even when it's scary.\
\
[00:11:10.850] - Rebakah\
But getting it done first you've now made more progress than if you focused on the rest of the stuff in your business that won't get you the results you desire.\
\
[00:11:25.110] - Rebakah\
Another mentor and business coach that I look to at times is James Wedmore. And he had a series of podcast episodes that talked about time and productivity and time management, and he also teaches a similar concept. So, if you're interested in learning more, you could check out some of his podcast because he talks about the top 5% in a very similar way. Same idea. One of his quotes or his mantras is the less you do, the more you will make. Meaning if you focus on that top 5%, the more money you're going to make by putting yourself out there doing those more important, sometimes scary things.\
\
[00:12:13.470] - Rebakah\
It's going to move your business forward faster, and ultimately, you're going to not work as hard because you're going to be doing less work while making more impact. So, I want to remind you also that every single thing we do is a choice. Every single thing you do in your business is a choice. And why does that matter? Because sometimes we need to prioritize and make choices about where we're going to spend our energy.\
\
[00:12:48.510] - Rebakah\
We need to accept the fact that we can't do everything. There's always a million things to do, but we need to make choices that are going to serve our business and our blog to give us the results that we want. And so, what this boils down to a lot of times is thinking about our Shoulds versus our Wants. As I mentioned, we often feel like we have to do all the things, and I mean both in our business and in our personal lives. We feel like we have to work hard and give value by doing everything for everyone.\
\
[00:13:27.390] - Rebakah\
And oftentimes that leaves very little for ourselves. Instead, stop thinking about what you should be doing, so eliminate the shoulds in your life. I should be doing this. I should be doing more. I should be working harder.\
\
[00:13:44.950] - Rebakah\
I should be helping my friend. I should be helping the school. I should be volunteering. There's so many things that we tell ourselves we should be doing, and I am urging you to stop shoulding on yourself. That is a phrase I heard from someone else.\
\
[00:14:02.650] - Rebakah\
I can't take credit, but it stuck with me, and I really remind myself of that often. Stop shoulding on myself. It's not helpful because sure, we could be doing so many things, but we don't have to. We have a choice and we can prioritize and instead focus on our wants. I want to grow my business.\
\
[00:14:28.540] - Rebakah\
I want to help my friend, even when it comes to cooking dinner for your family. Instead of saying I should be cooking a healthy dinner tonight, focus instead on the feeling of wanting to do that because when you want to do something, it energizes you. It motivates you from a deeper place and not laden with guilt, right, about what you should be doing. So, make a choice about where you want to spend your time, what you want to prioritize, both in your blogging world, in your business and in your personal life.\
\
[00:15:10.450] - Rebakah\
And like I said, I challenge you to make a choice today. Ask yourself, is there something I really need to do, or do I want to do it. Right? So, every task that comes your way, every request that comes your way, whether it's from your business, from your clients, from your colleagues, from the outside world, your community, ask yourself this filter every time. Is this something I really need to do? Or is it something I want to do?\
\
[00:15:43.450] - Rebakah\
When we're thinking about our blogging world, we might be feeling like we need to post three times a week or we need to be posting on social media on all the platforms. Okay, but is it really something you need to do? Is it going to help grow your business, or is it something you want to do? Maybe you only want to post on Instagram, but you feel like you need to also post on Facebook and Twitter? Ask yourself, is that true?\
\
[00:16:18.490] - Rebakah\
A lot of times when we prioritize and we focus on things that are most important that are going to get us the best results, we can learn to stop working harder and instead start focusing on what matters most. A lot of times too, we don't have a ton of time to work on our blog or our business. If you are someone like me who's juggling family life and other client work or maybe a nine to five job and you're blogging on the side and hopes to grow it into a full time business, we tell ourselves that we don't have time.\
\
[00:16:59.170] - Rebakah\
But instead of telling yourself these unhelpful thoughts, ask yourself, how can I make my blog happen or growth in my blog or business happen? Even if I only have 2 hours per day, or even if I only have 1 hour per day or 3 hours per week. Whatever your situation may be, start making a choice about how you can flip what you're needing to do versus what you're wanting to do. So that you can start prioritizing and making time for what's most important in your life and in your business.\
\
[00:17:36.430] - Rebakah\
And so some of the key beliefs to try out. These are some that have worked for me or my clients and maybe some of them will resonate with you. Instead of telling ourselves those unhelpful thoughts about I don't have time or I have to do everything and I have to keep working harder in order to be successful. Let's flip it and try telling yourself instead. I don't have to do everything for everyone.\
\
[00:18:03.370] - Rebakah\
I don't have to be busy to be worthy. I deserve to be taken care of too. This is one of my favorites, the most important things will get done. Notice I didn't say everything will get done. No, the most important things will get done.\
\
[00:18:22.590] - Rebakah\
The top 20%, everything that needs to get done will get done or everything I want to get done will get done. And finally, that one from James Wedmore again, is the less I do, the more I make. So, as we wrap up, I want to give you this guide to working less with an action plan, if you will, so that you know the next steps to take in order to get those results that you desire. Right now, your first step would be to become aware of those limiting thoughts and beliefs so that you can stop telling yourself disempowering stories, the Shoulds versus the Wants.\
\
[00:19:06.300] - Rebakah\
Right?\
\
[00:19:07.120] - Rebakah\
So, some ways that you can do that is to just Journal. If you like to Journal and write, just become aware of those thoughts by writing down, what is going through my mind right now? Why do I feel that I need to work harder? Ask yourself some of those questions from the beginning of this presentation. That's step one.\
\
[00:19:28.680] - Rebakah\
Then in the next 30 days, question those and investigate those limiting beliefs. Identify your Shoulds versus your Wants, so you could do that by creating lists. What do I feel like I should be doing and then make a column that is, what do I actually want to be doing? And you can do that for your business, for your blog, for your personal life. That is the first step.\
\
[00:19:52.070] - Rebakah\
And a lot of what I teach my clients is like identifying where you're spending your time currently and where you'd rather be spending your time, those are wants. And how to get from where you are now to your wants and your priorities. So, start questioning those. Start investigating them and identifying your wants both in your business, in your blog and in your personal life. And then the next step over the next day, 31 to 60 days, would be to make a new belief plan by rewriting your limiting beliefs into empowering, encouraging beliefs, and some of those I just gave you on the previous screen.\
\
[00:20:35.770] - Rebakah\
So, like I said, if those resonate with you, great, try practicing those by telling them to yourself, by writing it in your Journal, even if it's just one or two.\
\
[00:20:46.610] - Rebakah\
Sometimes that can really start to change the way we think. So that we're not working as hard because we start to believe that we don't have to. We don't have to work harder to be worthy. And then finally, over the next 61 to 90 days, I would try out these new thoughts and beliefs, start practicing them and putting them into action by making different choices and taking different actions. So, I have found that once I started truly believing those thoughts that I didn't have to do everything or I don't have to work hard to be successful.\
\
[00:21:22.990] - Rebakah\
Then I was able to make different choices about where I was spending my time in my business. I can make different choices for my blogging career and start to take different actions that would get me faster results without working harder. And if you're ready to combine this positive mindset and these new beliefs with actionable strategies, I would love to invite you to my free on demand workshop called How to Easily Plan Your Week using Asana. So, this is the next natural step in this action plan. Once we start to shift the way we're thinking and we finally believe and practice believing it might take a little while, let me just put that out there.\
\
[00:22:11.240] - Rebakah\
This might not happen overnight, and that's okay. But once we start to believe that we can do less and not have to work as hard, we can then start to plan our week by prioritizing using my strategies and recommendations in the program Asana, which is a digital tool that really makes it easy to organize and plan your business. So, if you're ready for that next step to put this into practice and see how that you can plan your week so that your blogging business is more successful and brings you more profits into your business.

**Transcript:**\
[00:00:03.650] - Rebekah Lara\
Hello, and welcome to Sanity Saving Systems for Bloggers. My name is Rebekah Lara, and I'm honored to be here with you today. A little about me before we begin. I am a certified time hacker coach, the creator of the Time Freedom Simplified program, and an online business manager for one client. But most of all, and most important, I should say, is that I am a mom to three young ladies who all have multiple medical conditions and special needs. So the theme you might see here is that when it comes to having limited time, I've been there. I am there. And that's why the topic of time is so important to me. If you find yourself saying, I don't have time for, fill in the blank, then I am the person who wants to support you to create more time freedom for what matters most to you. So what can you expect today? I will be sharing strategies, advice, tips, ideas, just things that I have put into practice myself and with clients and in another person's six-figure business to help you create sanity-saving systems for your business. Plus, there will be time for you to take action and start creating your systems today.\
\
[00:01:35.470] - Rebekah Lara\
But before we begin, what is a system? This is really helpful to pause and get clear on the definition so that you know what we're talking about moving forward, because different people might use this term differently. When I speak of a system, it is a procedure that outlines how to do something in your business to achieve your goals or create a desired result. My goal and intent here is that the system not only outlines how you do something, but it also saves you mental energy and space so that you can free up your brain, declutter your brain to be more creative and strategic in your business and as a blogger. People who are writers and entrepreneurs need to have focused creative time in order to serve the clients and community best. The other thing I want you to consider are some thoughts to lean into and perhaps believe or practice believing that there is no right way to do this. Meaning there's not one singular way to create a system for you, your blog, or your business. There's only my way, meaning you, the individual, the blogger. There's only your way and the way that works best for you.\
\
[00:03:05.280] - Rebekah Lara\
If you say that back to yourself, there's only my way and the way that works best for me. And that this can be simple. What are the benefits of systems? Obviously, we want to improve organization within our business. This will help us save time. It allows for delegation of duties, whether it's now or in the future, if you bring on a virtual assistant or grow a team. You won't have to rely on your memory for how to do tasks, and this is especially helpful for things that maybe you don't do every day. It's just once a month or once a quarter. It ensures that efficiency is high and error is low, especially when we're thinking about relying on our memory or outsourcing any of these tasks in our business. And finally, it frees up your time to do more strategic work and revenue-generating tasks, and anything else that you find fun and enjoyable. The ultimate benefit is that it frees up your time for what matters most in your life. So whether that be finding the extra time in your day to blog or grow your business, or if that means being able to do those tasks that are important in your blog and business, while also being able to create quality time with your family, space and energy and time to pursue hobbies and connect with friends and extended family members.\
\
[00:04:41.350] - Rebekah Lara\
Whatever you find important. We want your business to make an impact and be successful while also freeing up your time to go live life. So what system will you create first? I have some ideas for some simple systems. This is not an all-inclusive list. It's just meant to help get your wheels turning and brainstorm where you want to begin. You do not need to do all of these at once. I will suggest a couple of times throughout this presentation that we just start with one or two, and from there, you can build upon it. So some ideas for starting are anything that you do repeatedly or recurring tasks such as content planning, creation, content posting, recording podcast episodes, It could also include emailing your community and so on. You can also think about tasks that you want to remember how to do, like I mentioned, things that you don't do all the time, every day, every week. Perhaps it could be something like how to pay your affiliates, how to edit a podcast or a video, how to run a workshop series or a webinar, like what are the steps? Another idea would be how to submit a presentation for a summit like this one, or if you're participating in a bundle, anything that might have multiple steps that the next time you go to do it, you want to remember how to do it without needing to reach teach yourself.\
\
[00:06:16.640] - Rebekah Lara\
And third, what task would you want to outsource, whether now or in the future? Even if you're not quite ready to outsource, those are some places to set up those systems first so that when you are ready, whether it be just time and energy or you're bringing in the income that will support a team member, you are ready to go and you don't need to set up that system for them to begin. So think about what you would outsource first. What is something that can be delegated? There are some things in your business that only you can do, like record the podcast episode, perhaps. But other things, like editing the podcast episode, could be delegated to a team member or even a contractor. Another question to ask is, what do you dislike doing? You don't need to keep doing those things that you don't like doing once you bring on a team member or a virtual assistant. So that is something you could set up a system for ahead of time and have it ready to go when you hire someone. And what are tasks that you don't need to do yourself, which I already mentioned.\
\
[00:07:24.740] - Rebekah Lara\
That's a big one. Those are the things we want to outsource first. So Demo time. Let's look at some simple systems that I have created and used in my business that you could perhaps gain some inspiration from, take it as a starting point to develop your own, and just get the wheels turning for what it could look like. I'm a visual learner, so I like to provide these examples so that people can picture what it would look like for them in their business, and they can take this and run with it. So the few ideas I will share with you today, again, not an all-inclusive list, just a starting point, but my first simple planning system, my Monday Map, Week at a glance, Finish it Friday, and at the end, I will be able to share with you the ultimate content bank. So my first simple planning system was just a simple notebook, like the one in this image. It was actually a bullet journal, and I just labeled the date, and I identified the top three things I wanted to do each day. This was way back, like during the pandemic, my daughter had a very critical illness and was still at home recovering and on multiple medical interventions, including a feeding tube and daily oxygen, and the list goes on, right?\
\
[00:08:54.250] - Rebekah Lara\
Plus, I had two younger children who were home during the pandemic, and they were all doing remote learning through their computers. So I needed a super simple system to keep me on track because I still wanted to start growing and building my business. And so I just had a simple notebook, a bullet journal that I didn't use like a typical bullet journal, but I just liked it because it was wide open. All I do is put the date. I made three checkboxes, and I would identify the top three things I wanted to do each day. They didn't have to be big things. They could be simple things such as publish one Instagram post, write 500 words for my blog, that post that I was working on that week, and pin two Pinterest pins. Those were the things I could sustain and manage at that time in my life. So that was my first simple system. Next, I'm going to share my screen and show you the other ideas that I have for you if you're ready to take it to a digital level.\
\
[00:10:00.080] - Rebekah Lara\
This is a screen share showing my Asana account, and this is where I choose to keep track of some of these systems. First one is the Monday Map, and this is something that I've used to help me map out my week. It is named Monday Map because I have it recur every Monday in Asana to remind me to do these things. I've created this checklist here in the subtask area where I remind myself how I'm going to schedule things. I remind myself to schedule free time first, whether that looks like exercise or hobbies or connecting with a friend or reading a book. I tried to do that first because If I wait until there's extra time, we all know how that goes. Then it just runs through the different things that I want to do. You could certainly customize this and put this in any tool that you want, whether it be Notion or Trello or a checklist checklist in Excel or Google Sheets, whatever. There's no right way to do this. It's just use the tool that is working well for you right now and create a checklist like this. This is how you remember to do those things that you want to do every week, to plan out your week in an intentional way.\
\
[00:11:22.110] - Rebekah Lara\
I have it set so that it recurs. Well, it was recurring. But in Asana, you can set it to recur on every Monday. And then you set this up once, and when you are done, you can click Complete, and it will, in a moment, repopulate here to the following Monday.\
\
[00:11:43.690] - Rebekah Lara\
There it is.\
\
[00:11:45.910] - Rebekah Lara\
Likewise, I do something similar on Fridays at the end of my work week. Again, this doesn't have to be on a Monday or Friday. It can be any day that you desire that works with your schedule. But for me, it's Fridays. So Finish it Friday. I set up, again, a recurring task on every Friday, set it to repeat so that every Friday it's going to have this template already set up, and I do different things to wrap up my week. I evaluate using these questions like what worked, what didn't work, what will I do differently? I can obviously update and change this at any time. I like to write notes about open items that popped up throughout the week or things I didn't complete. I always try to celebrate at least three things that went well. So again, there is a checklist down here at the bottom to help me remember to do all those things. I also have a space to check in with my one-to-one clients and do Voxer coaching with those clients on Fridays. And then I always try to check in with my subscriptions to see what's renewing, if I need to cancel anything or track business expenses.\
\
[00:12:57.750] - Rebekah Lara\
If I do this repeatedly every week, it starts to become a routine and it flows. I don't have to think about what I need to do at the end of the week. I have it all set up here to remind me so that I can clear up my mental space and energy for other things. The third system that I keep track of in Asana, and I've helped other clients set up, is Week at a Glance. Again, this is something you could certainly set up in a multiple different places, such as Trello, I'm sure, and Notion. You could even print a PDF version of a calendar and do it that way. But I like to group and theme my days. I try to consider my energy level, my weekly schedule with the family obligations and other things going on, and just group those like tasks or similar tasks together. That way, I can flow easier through these typical tasks, and I'm also honoring my energy. So for me, this is just one example, how I have these themes for each day. Again, it allows me to batch content, to be in the right head space to do these things without switching back and forth between wildly different tasks.\
\
[00:14:21.800] - Rebekah Lara\
Now, if that works for you, I encourage you to keep doing what you're doing. But if you want to set up a week at a glance, So that, again, you don't have to think about every Monday, what do I do? It's just like, Oh, okay, on Mondays, I'm going to do planning and training and develop some SOPs. I like my Mondays to be a little slower and not have to do client meetings. I'm coming off a weekend where I am managing the family obligations, household things. So my energy, I'm not exactly rested every weekend. So Monday is my day to move slower and build that rest into my Mondays so that on Tuesdays, I can do things for clients. I have the energy and space to do that in my schedule. So things like Coaching client meetings, email follow-ups, things like that. And then you get the idea. This is, again, just an example. You don't have to do it exactly this way. But that way, every week, I know my flow for how I'm getting work completed, and I'm grouping them into similar activities. You can notice here there's a content planning day so that you could work on blog posts or at least the editing.\
\
[00:15:42.310] - Rebekah Lara\
As a blogger, you might want to consider different days for doing rough draughts or editing or final publishing, things like that could be helpful as well.\
\
[00:15:53.400] - Rebekah Lara\
So now it's your turn. Consider this question. What system will you create first? Given the ideas shared and the demonstration, what system do you think would be most beneficial to you that you would like to start with? Start with a simple one. We don't want to overly complicate our first documented system. We want this to be an easy process for you. So I encourage you to post in the chat and let us know. Feel free to also add any questions or celebrations, things maybe you're already doing that you want to share with others. Likewise, you can always go into the summit Facebook group and post there as well. Next, decide where you want to document your systems. Start creating just a couple of systems in the beginning, right? Like I just shared, based on what you came up with in step one. Just start with one, maybe two. You can always add more for other tasks, procedures, and projects as time goes on. Consider this like a living, breathing library of procedures or policies or whatever word you want to use there that makes it easier for you to start documenting. Remember, there's no right way to do this.\
\
[00:17:13.550] - Rebekah Lara\
There's only your way and the way that works best for you. So some of the places you could document these systems are in Asana, like I shared, in Airtable, which I will show you a content bank that you can use to get started, or even in something as simple as Google Docs. Just use a tool that you are already familiar with and use in your business, and ask yourself if you can start documenting your systems in that location. Step three will be to list all your steps and plan out the system. So remember to think like a beginner when you're doing this. Include details that would help someone just getting started or who has never done this certain task or project before. So remember, the idea is to include lots of details, especially if you're going to in the future or your plan in the future is to hire a team member or virtual assistant. You want to start explaining it from step one. Ask yourself, as you're thinking about how to plan out your system, what is the easiest way I can do this? How can I make sure I maximize efficiency I simplify the process, and I optimize my time?\
\
[00:18:33.300] - Rebekah Lara\
Those are our goals. We don't want to overly complicate this. You could list out the steps, just one, two, three, or a checkbox, like you saw in some of my examples. You can also include videos or images. Those are really helpful, especially to help you jog your memory and also for future team members, so that it could replace a potential one-on-one training session. If you use something like a Loom video or Asana has native video capabilities right built in the tool, you can record your screen and share that link out or include that with the documented system in the Google Doc or in Airtable so that a new employee or even yourself, when you're going back to a task you haven't done in a while, can quickly watch that brief video and see in action how while you're doing things. Visuals are so helpful for not only the team members, but also for you. So tips for you. Document your systems as you create them. You don't need to set aside multiple days to do this. I like to encourage my clients to just do it as you go. So the next time you're editing a podcast episode, document the system.\
\
[00:19:56.430] - Rebekah Lara\
What do you do first, second, third, or at that time, record your screen. At a minimum, you could record your screen using something like Loom and at least save that link, and then maybe later go back and elaborate and come up with the steps as you finetune it. You don't need to do them all at once, right? This is a living, breathing library that is going to grow and evolve over time. You can always update. You can always add to them. So again, pause here for a moment and decide where do you want to document your systems? This shouldn't take you very long. I encourage you to use something, a tool that you're already using. The only additional tip I will give you is that doing it somewhere digital, if you plan to collaborate with a team member, a contractor, or a virtual assistant, will be very helpful, especially if they are not local to you. So once again, I encourage you to post that decision decision. We are starting to make these decisions so that you can keep taking these next steps and start creating your systems today. And that first step is making the decision.\
\
[00:21:11.310] - Rebekah Lara\
So post that here in the chat with any questions, celebrations, or head over to the Facebook group so that we can cheer you on or support you as you take this next step. And like I said, if you have any questions overall on any of these steps that I shared today to help you Create sanity-saving systems for your blogging business, post in the summit Facebook group. I will be there to help support you in the best way I can. As long as the summit is happening, I will be around. So Tag me, post there, post your celebrations, tell us what you're doing, and if you hit any challenges or roadblocks along the way, please post. And if you want to take it one step further, I am happy to provide the ultimate Content Bank for you. This is another system I've created for myself using Airtable to help me organize all of my content, whether it be blog posts, emails, social media content. You can use this ultimate content bank to go from scattered to organized using this done for you Airtable template to organize the content, batch it, repurpose your content to help save you time.\
\
[00:22:29.140] - Rebekah Lara\

**Transcript:**\
[00:00:12.400] - Sage Grayson\
Welcome. This is Pomodoro Powerhouse. Create a kickass routine for consistency, content creation, and creativity. I'm Sage Grayson, and I'm super happy to be here today for the Blogger Breakthrough Summit. Get ready to learn how the Pomodoro Technique can make you a more consistent and powerful blogger. Let's go.\
\
[00:00:34.180] - Sage Grayson\
Who is this session for? This session is best for beginners who are new to blogging and content creation. You probably don't have a consistent schedule yet for completing your work, meeting deadlines, and implementing all the new strategies you're discovering. But this session will help you get on track so you can make steady progress without burning yourself out by using the Pomodoro Technique. Now, are you an intermediate or advanced blogger? Well, I want you to stick around anyway for my best tips to supercharge your time management and inject some fun into your work schedule. Who's Sage Grayson? That's me. I'm Sage. I'm a former book editor turned life and business coach. Since 2011, I've been helping ambitious women entrepreneurs edit their habits, routines, and mindsets to balance their happiness at work and home. I'm a life editor, and so are you. I'm a vegan, bi-sexual Buddhist who loves reading self-development books and quoting "The Simpsons" endlessly. I live for boosting productivity and streamlining systems to get stuff done. You can find me on YouTube for my business channel, also on YouTube for my reading channel, on Facebook, Pinterest, and of course, my blog, sagegrayson.com.\
\
[00:01:53.520] - Sage Grayson\
Now, before we get started, to get the most out of this session, please just take a minute to silence your phone, close any other open tabs, and grab a notebook or planner to capture the best strategies so you won't miss a thing. Here are our session objectives. First, we're going to talk about what is the Pomodoro Technique. Then I'm going to show you how you can use Pomodoro Sprint for content creation. Then I've got 30 fun ways to focus your Pomodoro Sprint. And of course, I'm going to give you your next steps and a special freebie if you stick around to the end. Now, what is the Pomodoro Technique? Well, the Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. The technique's name, Pomodoro, which means tomato in Italian, was inspired by the tomato-shaped kitchen timer that Cirillo initially used. Now, Cirillo was a university student struggling with productivity and time management.\
\
[00:02:53.910] - Sage Grayson\
We've all been there. He wanted to improve his focus and complete tasks more efficiently. After many experiments, he discovered that 25 minutes was an optimal duration to maintain concentration without causing burnout. We like that. Now here is the basic Pomodoro Technique, and I'm going to give you some examples for how you can edit this technique in just a little bit, so hang on.\
\
[00:03:19.650] - Sage Grayson\
Here's the basic technique. Number one, you're going to choose a task. Select a specific task to work on that can be completed in one Pomodoro. That's 25 minutes. Number two, set your timer. Set a timer for 25 minutes to work on only the chosen task, nothing else. Number three, work until the timer rings. During the Pomodoro, focus exclusively on the task at hand. Resist the urge to engage in distractions or to switch tasks. Number four, take a break. Once the timer rings, take a short five-minute break. This allows for a quick mental recharge. Oh, yeah. And, number five, of course, you're going to repeat. After completing four Pomodoro's, which is two hours, take a longer break of around 15 to 30 minutes. The Pomodoro technique continues to increase in popularity and has been adopted by individuals, professionals, and teams worldwide for its simplicity and effectiveness in combating procrastination and enhancing productivity.\
\
[00:04:23.040] - Sage Grayson\
Now, I got to ask you, have you tried the Pomodoro Technique? And if so, how did you alter it for your business, lifestyle, energy levels, etc.? I can't wait to hear your thoughts.\
\
[00:04:35.460] - Sage Grayson\
Here's how we do Pomodoro Sprint for content creation. First, do a brain dump and write down everything you want to get done. Just let your thoughts flow. Maybe it's writing, planning, uploading, photo and image creation, social media, scheduling, and more. Then you're going to choose your next most important projects. Maybe you have some deadlines coming up or you have something that has a really high return on investment, or the ones that must get done today or this week. You can choose your Pomodoro Sprint for just today, or you might do a week's worth of planning in advance. It's up to you. Then you're going to define your time budget. That is how much time you have to work during the day or the week to devote to your Pomodoros. So maybe you have two hours a day or five hours a day, or maybe you have four hours on two separate days. It really depends on what your specific schedule looks like.\
\
[00:05:33.870] - Sage Grayson\
If you want to learn more about creating an effective time budget, then you're going to want to stick around to the end where I share my freebie with you. Next, identify what you'll work on for each Pomodoro. You may work on a single project for the entire session or switch tasks with each Pomodoro. Plan what you'll do during your breaks. This is important, too. Maybe you'll stretch, use the bathroom, read a book, make a cup of tea. I found that having something to look forward to makes it much easier to focus during those 25-minute Pomodoros. Then you're going to set up your Timer for your Sprint. Now, you could use an app, and there are dozens of Pomodoro apps out there, or you could just simply use the timer on your phone. You'll set it up for 25 minutes of working, followed by a five-minute break and have it repeating. Finally, you're going to run your Sprint and focus only on the task for that Pomodoro. And don't stop until the timer goes off. All right, here's the best part. I've got 30 fun ways to focus your Pomodoro Sprint. Now, for this part, I want you to write down the ideas that you want to try next to help you maintain a consistent content creation schedule. Then you're going to circle or highlight your top five and start implementing those Pomodoros this week.\
\
[00:06:54.910] - Sage Grayson\
All right, let's go. Subject-based Sprint. You can focus on subjects, categories, or tasks during each Pomodoro session. For example, work on writing for one session, then switch to research for the next one, then switch to editing for the next one, and on and on.\
\
[00:07:12.630] - Sage Grayson\
Creative Writing Sprint. Set specific word count goals for each 25-minute session. Then try to beat that word count with each following session. Or choose a different writing prompt or topic for each session, such as blog categories.\
\
[00:07:28.010] - Sage Grayson\
Multitasking Sprint. Now, multitasking isn't all bad, really. You could alternate between two or more tasks within each 25-minute session to keep things fresh. For example, you might write social media posts for 15 minutes and then schedule them for 10 minutes, completing your 25-minute Pomodoro Sprint.\
\
[00:07:49.610] - Sage Grayson\
Content Creation Sprint. Use each Pomodoro session to create content for your website, blog, social media, and other platforms. See how many Pomodoros it takes to write a blog post versus a YouTube video script. This will help you for planning your time in the future.\
\
[00:08:07.480] - Sage Grayson\
Focused Distraction Time. Dedicate one Pomodoro session to handle all potential distractions. And I know there's a lot of them. Maybe your emails, your messages, your notifications, and then shut them off for the following sessions. This gives you a clean slate before you begin your most important work.\
\
[00:08:27.090] - Sage Grayson\
Brain Dump Sprint. Use one Pomodoro to brainstorm ideas for blog post, projects, digital products, social media posts, videos, or other creative endeavors. Get it all out of your head to reduce anxiety before you begin your focused work. This one really works for me.\
\
[00:08:46.360] - Sage Grayson\
Mindfulness Meditation. Insert a mindfulness exercise or meditation into one of your Pomodoro sessions to relax and rejuvenate your mind. So, determine when during that day you're most tired or unmotivated, and then plan to do a meditation then. For me, that's around two or three in the afternoon. That's when my energy starts tanking, and that's when I need a refresh.\
\
[00:09:11.860] - Sage Grayson\
Skills Enhancement Sprint. Spend at least one Pomodoro session each day learning or enhancing a new skill. I love it. You might watch a Skillshare class, or read a book in your field, or try a new software or app, or watch Summit videos to learn from the best.\
\
[00:09:30.120] - Sage Grayson\
Incremental Breaks. Gradually increase the length of your breaks starting with five minutes and adding a minute to each cycle. This is helpful for those of us who lose energy over the course of the day and need longer to recharge after a period of focused work.\
\
[00:09:47.200] - Sage Grayson\
Sprint and Reflect. After each Pomodoro session, spend a few minutes of your break reflecting on what you accomplished and planning for the next session. I like to keep a progress journal to remind myself of all the work I already completed, especially when I'm feeling unmotivated. This is very, very helpful.\
\
[00:10:07.890] - Sage Grayson\
Daily Journaling. Dedicate a Pomodoro session to journaling your thoughts, experiences, and goals. Now, you could follow a guided journal with specific prompts or just let your thoughts flow onto the page naturally. You might want to see the morning pages exercise in the book "The Artist's Way" by Julia Cameron.\
\
[00:10:29.060] - Sage Grayson\
Visualization and Goal Setting. Spend a session visualizing your goals and creating a plan to achieve them. You might make a list of people who have achieved the goals that you want and then figure out what steps they took that you can duplicate.\
\
[00:10:44.630] - Sage Grayson\
Mini Workshop Live Streams. Conduct mini workshops or training sessions for clients or social media followers during each Pomodoro session. This is so fun. This built-in time limit keeps you on topic and provides those short and sweet tips for your audience. You might consider TikTok videos or YouTube shorts.\
\
[00:11:07.810] - Sage Grayson\
Reading Sprint. Set a goal to read a specific number of pages or chapters in a book during each session. I do reading Sprints a lot. As a former book editor, of course I do. Time how long it takes you to read an average page and then multiply that by the number of pages to determine how many Sprints you'll need to finish the book. Here's a very basic example. Let's say you time yourself and it takes you about one minute to complete reading an average page. If you have a book that is 100 pages long and you read at one minute per page, then it will take you four Pomodoros, that's 25, 25, 25, 25 to complete the book or two hours. I use this all the time when I am considering what book I'm going to read next and how much time do I have to devote to it.\
\
[00:12:01.220] - Sage Grayson\
Skills Sharpening. Practice and refine specific skills related to your profession during each Pomodoro. For example, if you're a YouTuber, practice speaking clearly on camera and building your on-air confidence.\
\
[00:12:15.490] - Sage Grayson\
Mind Mapping. Use Pomodoro sessions to create mind maps for organizing thoughts, ideas, and projects. This is an excellent exercise for mapping out the main categories for your blog and then pulling out the topics for each category to see where things overlap and build on each other.\
\
[00:12:33.720] - Sage Grayson\
Visual Art Creation. Focus on creating sketches, digital art, or any form of visual art during each session. Do you have a shop to fill? Plan a specific number of Pomodoros each week for creating your art so you always have something to add to your portfolio or shop. This happens to many of my clients who sell physical products or their art is that they're working so much on their shop and their website and their blog that they're not actually making their art. Make sure you fit in a Pomodoro where you're actually creating your visual art.\
\
[00:13:09.830] - Sage Grayson\
Decluttering Sessions. Do you find it hard to get started when your room is messy? Me too! Dedicate a Pomodoro session to de-clutter and organize your workspace or living area, and then you won't be tempted to clean up while you're doing your focused work. Does anyone else do that? Oh, I've got to clean my desk first before I can work. Oh, I got to do the dishes first before I can work. No more. Do your de-cluttering session for one Pomodoro and then keep on moving.\
\
[00:13:39.620] - Sage Grayson\
Networking and Outreach. Spend a session reaching out to mentors, accountability partners, contacts, "super fans", or other people who could support you and your blog in some way. Reach out on social media or send those follow-up emails asking for specific guidance. I've always found that giving them a specific request gets a better result than just generally reaching out.\
\
[00:14:05.580] - Sage Grayson\
Digital Detox. You need a self-care session. We all do. Disconnect completely during your Pomodoro sessions to increase focus and minimize distractions. You might even use a non-digital timer, which you can find on Amazon, or write by hand in a notebook instead of typing on your laptop, or otherwise forego technology and screens.\
\
[00:14:30.190] - Sage Grayson\
Photography Challenges. Use each session to go out and capture specific themes or subjects through photography. Now, this is helpful if your blog is about travel, lifestyle, recipe, shopping, books, or something else. It's great for filling your social media accounts too.\
\
[00:14:48.370] - Sage Grayson\
Search Engine Optimization or SEO. Focus on optimizing your meta tags, descriptions, and keywords during each 25-minute session. Now, successful bloggers focus on more than just the writing. You could have the best content in the world, but without SEO, no one will read it.\
\
[00:15:09.880] - Sage Grayson\
Email Management. Allocate at least one Pomodoro session to respond to emails, clean out your inbox, and organize your email system. This "clearing the decks" exercise will help you feel less scattered and make sure you don't miss any important notices. For me, I often publish guest posts and sponsored posts, which means I need to check my emails to see if there's any new content. So give yourself one Pomodoro session to make sure you're not missing anything important in your inbox.\
\
[00:15:40.790] - Sage Grayson\
Product Development Sprints. Break down the process of creating a new product or service into Pomodoro sessions, focusing on the different stages. You might first search for old content you can repurpose, then edit it, then create slides, then upload it to your CRM, etc. Many of my clients have had success by going through their old blog post, pulling out similar themes, and then creating ebooks or workshops based on that old content. You might wonder, well, why would anyone buy something that they can find on your blog for free? The reason is nobody's got time to crawl through your archives trying to find the information they need. By gathering up similar pieces of content and repurposing it into a new product, you make it easier for your clients and customers. And, you can quickly fill your shop with new products without having to make something from scratch.\
\
[00:16:35.510] - Sage Grayson\
Analytics and Reporting. What's working for your blog and what's not? Use sessions to review website analytics, track conversion rates, and generate reports. I know this is the boring stuff, but it's so helpful. Determine your top 10 most viewed pieces of content and then optimize your images, opt-in boxes, interlinking, and more. I have many of my clients go through their old blog posts, find out which ones are most popular, then create new images to add to those blog posts so that they are pinnable on Pinterest. It's also good to check to make sure you don't have any outdated information or broken links.\
\
[00:17:16.230] - Sage Grayson\
Social Media Engagement. Engage with your audience. Respond to comments and schedule posts during each session. If you want people to read your blog, watch your videos, or listen to your podcast, you must do the marketing so they know you exist. You can't ignore social media as much as you might want to.\
\
[00:17:35.590] - Sage Grayson\
Market Research and Trends. Spend sessions researching industry trends, doing competitor analyses, and studying customer behavior. This helps your content be more topical and buzzworthy and prevents you from writing pieces your readers aren't interested in.\
\
[00:17:53.130] - Sage Grayson\
Affiliate Program Management. Make some moolah from your blog. Use Pomodoro sessions to review and manage your affiliate partnerships and marketing efforts. Now, this is your affiliate program for yourself and other people's affiliate programs that you support. Take one Pomodoro to research your top affiliates for your program. Is there a way that you can reward them in addition to the commission they're already getting? I know business owners who have contests once a month to see who is the top affiliate, and then they get an extra bonus prize. It's a nice way to remind people to keep sharing their links.\
\
[00:18:31.560] - Sage Grayson\
A/B testing and Optimization. Focus on testing different elements of your website or marketing campaigns during each session. Which opt-in boxes are getting the most signups on your blog? And which pinned image brings the most traffic to your blog or shop? I think you might be surprised if you actually look at the data.\
\
[00:18:53.070] - Sage Grayson\
And finally, Strategic Planning. Dedicate Pomodoro sessions to develop and refine your business strategy, set goals and plan for growth. No more winging it. No, you're not going to do that anymore. If you fail to plan, then you plan to fail. Make sure that you're working towards goals that matter to you. All it takes is dedicating some time to focus on your strategic plan.\
\
[00:19:20.350] - Sage Grayson\
That's it. Let's do a summary of everything that you learned during today's session. The Pomodoro Technique was developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. Each Pomodoro consists of 25 minutes of working time, followed by a five-minute break and repeat it for at least two hours. Set up your Pomodoro Sprint for content creation so you can make steady, consistent progress on your blog. The most successful creators don't wing it. The technique can be adapted to fit your time budget, your business, your lifestyle, your energy levels, and more. Remember, have fun with it.\
\
[00:19:57.540] - Sage Grayson\
Are you ready to start? Are you ready to level up your content creation? Which strategies will you try to implement the Pomodoro Technique into your blogging schedule? Now, I hope you have a big list of Pomodoro ideas that you want to try. Now, I want you to circle or highlight at least five ideas that you can start implementing this week. Don't just listen to this session. I want you to really take some action and do your Pomodoro Sprint.\

Alright, guys. I'm really excited to have this speaker back. This is, I believe her second time at the summit. She's an international bestselling author, a passionate speaker, recording artist, television featured performing artist, actress, founder, content creator, podcast strategist, mentor coach, and host of the Radiant Pearl Living Podcast and the Fearless Creator Podcast. She enjoys publishing, producing, and sharing amazing resources that will help make a difference in the lives of others. A big warm welcome to Stacy Zant. Stacy, thank you so much for coming back.\
\
[00:00:40.830] - Stacy\
Thank you for having me back. I'm so excited. \
\
[00:00:44.850] - Liz\
Yeah. So, we're going to be talking about streamlining your blog content process, so you can create more productivity and profitability. How would you define streamlined, would be I guess my first question?\
\
[00:00:58.210] - Stacy\
Yes, I love that question because just keeping it simple, streamlining is just really allowing things to have a flow that I love to say is organic and that is just going to work in tandem with each other. You think about a river or you think about a stream that is, you know continuing to flow and build on each other to accomplish its goal of movement, movement forward. Right? And so, streamlining is just really being able to keep that momentum and that movement that you need to have happen in your business and as a blogger, go forward in a succinct, clear, concise and beautiful way.\
\
[00:01:49.090] - Liz\
I like that. Okay, can you give us like a specific example of how this would work in terms of the blog process?\
\
[00:01:56.470] - Stacy\
Yes. So, for myself, I've seen the advantage of having really my contact calendar and I know in the past I've spoken a lot about that, being able to have a system in place that works for me and it looks different for everyone and you have to test and try things. Right. And so for me, I started with the traditional planner and still love that. But having checks and balances with a spreadsheet that not only I can reference, but also team members of mine because there's so many moving parts when you're running a business online and you have blog and you have all the fun things like content creation. Right. And so, for me, just being able to see, okay, I have a schedule and I have structure and that allows things to be simplified and streamlined for myself and those who I work alongside off. So, we can keep creating content consistently. And if there is a rare downtime, we can repurpose that content as well because we know what's ahead and we know what to plan for.\
\
[00:03:04.730] - Liz\
Okay, so if someone is trying to figure out sort of their process or their system, where do you recommend they start?\
\
[00:03:13.230] - Stacy\
Yeah, so you know how easy it is to have a Google Calendar on your phone and so of course, making it as simple as possible with your handheld device. But if you realize, okay, I need something more, how can you maybe incorporate that spreadsheet in your Google Drive that is still accessible. I love personally working on updating our content calendar, holistically, it's for a whole year that I can see it, and if I want to zoom in for the month, I can, or for the quarter, and that is accessible on my iPad, it's a little bit bigger. So, working your way up and having templates that you can use, so you're not reinventing the wheel and you don't have to look at a blank thing to canvas to try and get creative when you should be putting your creativity in the content that's going to produce the results and the bottom line for your business.\
\
[00:04:15.810] - Liz\
Okay, so you mentioned templates. What kind of template? Because template could be a graphic template, it could be a template for this is how we do a review post. Like the variety of templates you can have can vary widely. So what are some examples of templates? And do you have any tips on making sure you know where to find those templates so it doesn't get lost in the shuffle?\
\
[00:04:39.050] - Stacy\
Yes. I love that. So, you know one of the biggest things that I love preaching about, and in the past, I've done like the click up template, but having a template within the actual Google Doc, Google Drive, it's so easy to copy, right. When you have a spreadsheet that's already been created that works, and then being able to utilize that plug in your own information that's relevant for your own business, your own blog. And I've heard from so many, have received so much feedback from other fearless creators who said, man, I didn't know how much I needed this. Because you have an idea of what you need to do, but then you may not necessarily know how to go about doing them in the most effective way because you're just getting started or you haven't tested things or tried things. And so, I know there's so many places you can get templates when you just Google and search online. That's how your blog can come up. Right? If you maximize certain elements of SEO and creating the same sort of content, but the same thing when you search for a keyword or utilizing people in the summit.\
\
[00:05:49.510] - Stacy\
Right? I know you have templates probably as well, Liz and I myself, and they're gaining access. So, there's so much. Yeah. That you can maximize as a blogger.\
\
[00:06:00.690] - Liz\
Okay, that leads me to my next question is how do you evaluate if something is working or not, or if it's kind of working, how you tweak it? Because it's one thing to come up with this process. And I think when we're blogging, we're like, okay, let me sit down, let me think of this process, let me write it all out and let's do it. And then in the reality, it doesn't always work well. So, how are you evaluating it? What are kind of the things you're basing that evaluation on? And how do you fix it if it's not quite working or if it's kind of working?\
\
[00:06:30.910] - Stacy\
Yes. This is such a pertinent question because I don't think we do it enough. When we think about just all that it entails in creating the content, getting it out there, then we're like we can now breathe and we just move on to the next thing. But no, you know, research is important. It's not just for those who went to traditional school, it's for everyone who wants to succeed in their business and what they're passionate about doing and producing. And so I found being able to look at the analytics of what it is that you are creating and seeing how it's really creating an effect on your business and it may not be to the bottom line, but it may lead to the bottom line. And one way to know that is getting feedback, right? Having it a part of the structure and automation where when people get a product of yours or a freebie opt in or when they are reading your content, it's blatant right there. Comments, right? That's a feedback way of knowing, okay, if people are really resonating with my content. But giving that call to action and finding ways we've heard of the saying that it takes relatively between 20 to 30 times for a person to be told or to hear something before they actually take action.\
\
[00:07:57.340] - Stacy\
So, how many ways are you being creative in saying the same thing over and over again so that people will be able to give you the feedback you need? So, you can know what is measurable, what is working? What you need to tweak, what you need to improve on, so that you can get the results that you're looking for through your content and through your blog piece.\
\
[00:08:20.510] - Liz\
Yes, I do like that, call to action. And that I feel it can be sometimes frustrating for people because they don't necessarily have a lot of traffic to base that evaluation on. But the other thing you did mention was automations. And I think in evaluating your process too, if you find that you are constantly having to go look for something like that, a little bit of time adds up. And I think creating automation, so that it's just there can really help. But how do you evaluate the automation that you're using?\
\
[00:08:52.650] - Stacy\
Yes, so whenever I have certain opportunities to even partner to get the word out, you know we're doing that already right now with the summit. But when you are looking to create content, maybe your guest posting or your guest teaching, and you have content that complements what you're teaching, don't assume that you know everything. Right? Every audience can be a little bit different and the person who has been building that audience would know best. And so, one of the things that I found that's measurable, even for myself, that led to measurable results that's still yielding dividends today and profits today is sending out a survey to the owner, to the person who has invited me, making it very easy for them to be able to share it with their audience before I come in. And then allowing me to see what their struggles are, what their words are, what is it that they're looking for in terms of content? Because when you're a blogger, you're a content creator, right? So, you want to create that content around meeting their needs. And so that goes in tandem with not just speaking it's all around, because then you can share your knowledge and expertise as well in a blog that you may be posting on someone else's platform or on your own platform.\
\
[00:10:24.310] - Stacy\
Right? And so, when you automate, there's a few different survey platforms that are really good with it being so intuitive that all they have to do is literally click a link. And it just takes them through step by step in their email, if they're on your email list or on the other person's email list, if you've made it available to them. So, many great effective ways that I've found to be beneficial to help me, to really get clear on helping the people that I need to help.\
\
[00:10:55.490] - Liz\
Yes, I like that. I actually haven't done an audience survey in a long time, and I really should. I might sync that in. I will say, if you guys are struggling with ideas for collaborations, we have a session with [inaudible 00:11:06] where we talk about a ton of different ways you can collaborate with others, because there's probably more ways than you realize. Okay, so the next question I want to ask, because I think it's just as important to learn from people's successes as it is their mistakes. What are mistakes you see people making when it comes to trying to streamline, trying to automate, you know, like what are the mistakes you're seeing?\
\
[00:11:30.910] - Stacy\
Yes. I'll even say for myself, getting excited about the shiny new thing. We've heard about the shiny new object, the syndrome there where you just really want to try this new thing. And it may not be the season for it, and it may not really be productive in the time that you have to be able to move the needle forward. And so, really evaluating, taking a step back and being able to say, okay, I'm going to wait on this new shiny thing, or I'm going to test, you knwo, see if I have a little wiggle room in my schedule as to be planning in advance. Right? And being able to look and see for myself, really having a constant time right. Like scheduled in time to be able to think about these things. It's not just once a year or once a quarter, but are you weekly meeting? Sometimes they can be considered a drag, but even if it's a meeting with yourself, being able to look over and see, okay, what can I implement that could work? And do I have space in my schedule, so that it doesn't take away from the things that I'm already doing that I know I need to get done.\
\
[00:12:47.570] - Stacy\
And that does work.\
\
[00:12:49.590] - Liz\
Yeah, taking a step back, because sometimes, especially when you're a content creator, like, you're so in the weeds because you're right, there are so many moving pieces, there's so much going on. But taking a step back to look at the big picture and you may realize some of the things you're doing actually aren't producing the results you want. So, you can drop them, you know. And so that way you're only doing things you need to, like you said, and you can see, oh, well, this isn't actually working for me, so why don't I drop this? I think this might work better. I'll try it in that spot. So, you're not just adding, adding, adding, adding, adding to the list, which I think a lot of people do with every new thing they learn. The list just gets longer and longer without realizing that it's not actually producing results. So, I think that's a great point to do as frequently as you can, really. If you're starting to feel burned out or like your to do list is never ending, I think that's a great example of it's time to take a step back and look at the bigger picture.\
\
[00:13:40.070] - Stacy\
Definitely, yes.\
\
[00:13:41.990] - Liz\
Just want to say, I wholeheartedly agree with that. Besides the shiny new objects, are there any other mistakes you see commonly happening, holding people back?\
\
[00:13:51.690] - Stacy\
Yes. You know when it comes to really being able to see the results, there's a lot of times people quit before they really can get the results. And so that's why I always say and have no ted. Whenever you're going to try a new thing or you're going to establish a schedule or routine or something that you've had a desire to build or launch, try it for at least 90 days. And I know that sounds like, oh, my word, 90 days, three months, or just giving yourself grace and time to be able to put the information out there. Get it in front of enough people, and still in the grand scheme of things, that's not enough time. When you're planning an event, you know this as a host rate of a summit. And when you have a business that is continually putting out invaluable content, you recognize that there sometimes isn't enough time in the day to get all of the marketing components after you created the actual content and the product. So, really giving yourself that grace and that time to test things. And I've seen a lot of people, they don't do that. They see, oh, right away within the first week.\
\
[00:15:09.000] - Stacy\
Oh, no response. There's crickets or there's just not the results that they wanted. And they just needed to push forward a little bit longer. They needed to tweak some things, they needed to get the word out some more, just so that they will be able to see what really lands and works.\
\
[00:15:26.230] - Liz\
Yes, because, I totally agree with that. You got to give time for what you do to work. It's hard to be patient. I know. One thing that really stuck with me that I learned was or that I heard was if you do like, because sometimes it's like a challenge, right? And you do a challenge and it's crickets, but it's only like a one time thing, it's not really wait 90 days to see if it works. But they were like, do it at least three times before you give up on it. Because you learn each time you do it. And you might see by the second or third time where the first time is like kind of crickets, or there's only a couple of people by the third time. Once you've learned and you've actually gone through it, it really will take off and you just need to give it a couple more tries. So, yeah, I was just like, it's kind of in that same vein, but where it's not something that a set number of days is going to help. It where you just got to do it a few more times. So, yeah, I love that.\
\
[00:16:25.130] - Liz\
Okay, so any final tips for people that are struggling with trying to streamline to be more productive, more profitable? What do you want them to know?\
\
[00:16:38.910] - Stacy\
Yes, you know there's so much that you can do, but I want you to focus on where it is you are right now, where it is that you ultimately want to go. I always love to say and teach on having the big picture in mind. And there are so many elements to being able to reach to that big picture. Don't get overwhelmed by all the steps that you have to take. Just take them one step at a time. And it really does help knowing that other people have been there, other people have been able to accomplish that great feat that you're looking to accomplish, whether it's that goal of the amount that you want to reach in terms of revenue in your business, you know, the profitability piece or the reach the amount of people you want in your audience to help. Because some of us, we are doing it with the heart and that mindset that we just want to reach people, and we hope, right, that we have what we need monetarily to do all the things and to be the blessing that we've been called to be. And just recognizing if you help someone to get to where they need to go, then it's going to come full circle.\
\
[00:17:57.760] - Stacy\
And so, just focus. Even if you have one person in your audience that's now responding, that is one more person that you are able to impact, and I hope and I believe for eternity, transformative impact. Because you love what you do. You're walking in purpose, and you're helping others to do the same as you're inspiring and encouraging them to walk in purpose because they're inspired by you walking in purpose. So, I want you to really think about the focus on what it is that you ultimately want to accomplish. That big picture plan, and just go ahead and work towards it one day at a time, one step at a time. If you feel overwhelmed, get the help of someone else. You're already doing that. Taking in all this training here in the summit, you know, you may have coach, you may have someone that's there in your corner, a little angel cheering you on, whatever you need. Don't let it stop you from focusing on what it is that you've been created fearlessly to accomplish and do in this season. We believe in you. I believe in you.\
\
[00:19:06.670] - Liz\
I'm resisting to urge to clap right now because it would be really loud. I love that. Okay. I know you do have something you want to tell our attendees about. I'm going to let you tell us about it.\
\
[00:19:21.330] - Stacy\
So, you know a big part of being able to get your message out there fearlessly and of course, being able to blog and create content and have all these moving parts that are so beautifully taking you down to that path of that big picture plan is really being able to build your authority. And people don't recognize how important it is when people Google you and when they take the time to put in your name, what comes up, what are you doing, how are you making an impact and showing that you are who you say you are and what you're about. Right? And so, just being able to help you with the template, whether it's starting to build your authorities through a book, it could be a lead magnet or it can be something that you first use to sell as a product in your shop. And just being able to find ways to monetize and become profitable right off the bat, even if you're just getting started or you need an infusion, a little injection of cash. And so, we've provided that along with some other training and opportunities to help you boost your authority. And so, you'll get that authority booster. If you did upgrade, you get access to that, but you can also.\
\
[00:20:39.210] - Liz\
Otherwise, you can go check it out for, you know, I don't know, for a good deal. But yeah, if you do get the all access passed, you will get access to that for free. Again, Stacy, thank you so much. And guys, if you have any questions, don't hesitate to reach out. I appreciate you coming back, Stacy. It was fantastic.\
\
[00:20:58.990] - Stacy\
Thank you for having me. Always such a delight.\

[00:00:12.910] - Liz\
All right, guys. I'm super excited for this expert. She is a business strategist and coach who helps service providers and coaches create businesses that allows them to work less than 20 hours a week and live life on their terms. So, her aim is to help you simplify, streamline, and scale your business to over six figures while keeping you in the CEO seat and not constantly working. It is Stephanie Blake. Stephanie, thank you so much for joining us again. I think you were one of the very first Summit speakers the first year, and I so appreciate you coming back.\
\
[00:00:43.930] - Stephanie\
Thank you for having me. I love to talk about this. I could talk about this all day, so you will have to cut me off at some point. But I'm so glad to be here and so excited to share this information with everybody listening in. \
\
[00:00:55.240] - Liz\
Yes. Because I know a lot of bloggers, especially when they're starting their full-time job and trying to find that time and figure out what to do. So, I'm just going to dive in and ask sort of, what do you think the keys are to getting everything done just 20 hours a week like that's.\
\
[00:01:11.060] - Stephanie\
Yeah. Yeah. So, this is a loaded question because there's a lot of different things that I can say about this right now. But I will say the most important thing that you can do is have one offer that you're selling. So, I call this your six-figure signature offer, because what I do is I teach people how to reach six figures in 20 hours or less, ideally a week. So, by having that one six-figure signature offer, you're simplifying everything else in your business. So not just what you're selling, but it also simplifies everything on the back end of your business, too, which is what a lot of people don't necessarily think about. Right? Because you also need systems to run your business, especially as online business owners and bloggers. So, once you have that one offer, the six-figure signature offer, then you can market to your ideal client. So that would be my second piece of advice is to make sure that you are solving one problem for one person, and you need to know who this person is on a really deep soul level. So, not just saying like, you want to work with somebody or you want to support somebody because you want to give them more time or in their schedule or more money in their bank account.\
\
[00:02:22.030] - Stephanie\
Those are very surface level [inaudible 00:02:25] struggles that they have. We need to speak on them, speak to them on a deeper level. And once you can connect with them, that's when the sales start coming.\
\
[00:02:32.790] - Liz\
Yes. So, like, an example would be something like, I want them to have more time to read their favorite book and enough money to not stress about all the books they want to buy, you know like something really detailed because you're like, you know they love to read and they have no time.\
\
[00:02:48.040] - Stephanie\
Yeah, exactly.\
\
[00:02:48.850] - Liz\
Something like that. Okay, so.\
\
[00:02:50.590] - Stephanie\
But even deeper. Even deeper, more emotional.\
\
[00:02:53.970] - Liz\
Well, yeah. That's one little tiny aspect.\
\
[00:02:57.540] - Stephanie\
Exactly.\
\
[00:02:57.850] - Liz\
These sessions are 30 minutes or less.\
\
[00:03:00.710] - Stephanie\
That's what I said. You have to cut me off because I could talk about this for hours and hours. Yeah.\
\
[00:03:04.980] - Liz\
Okay, so we talk about you know your signature six-figure offer. That offer doesn't have to be a super high price point necessarily, depending on what you're doing. I know you focus on like service-based businesses, but some people do digital products, you know, like just because it's going to make you six figures doesn't mean you have to charge $5,000.\
\
[00:03:25.170] - Stephanie\
Yeah. I mean, it depends on what your goals are too. So, for example, you can have a business where you're charging high ticket and then you won't need as many clients. Or you can have a business where you're charging low tickets, where you're charging something for like, I don't know, $99 a month, which is much lower. But you need more people to fill that space. So, then how are you going to get those leads which will then turn into clients? Right. That's where a lot of the time comes in. Now if you're running ads, that's one route to go. If you're doing organic, that's another route to go. So, it all comes back to what you want, like how you choose to build your business. Because you get to decide which I love. Just great.\
\
[00:04:00.220] - Liz\
Yes. And I think so the back end in the system plays such a huge part because like you said, you want to focus on one offer. Because when you have two offers and you've got two sets of frequently asked questions, customer service issues, everything kind of expands. It's like, oh, I want to get the you know, a king size bed, well, now I need new sheets, a new comforter, you know like stuff expands. So, what are sort of the systems and even automations that you think help people kind of stay focused and get things done in those 20 hours?\
\
[00:04:32.290] - Stephanie\
Okay. So, I could get really nerdy and really technical here because if you ever logged into my Zapier account, which is a tool that I use for automations in my business, you will see over 150 different automations that I have set up my business.\
\
[00:04:47.510] - Liz\
Okay.\
\
[00:04:48.280] - Stephanie\
Because my rule of thumb is if I don't have to be doing it, I need to either delegate it, automate it, or eliminate it completely. So, there's very few things that I actually need to be doing as the CEO of my business. The vast majority of those things, which I realized after being a business for almost seven years at this point, could just be eliminated altogether. It was just unnecessary work that I was adding to my plate. But in terms of specific automations, it varies from business to business. But you should have if you're working with clients, you should have some kind of client onboarding sequence that should all be automated. You don't need to do any of that. If you send clients gifts, that can all be automated. If you're doing email marketing or posting on social media, all of that can be automated as well. So, all you should be focusing on as the CEO of your business is creating the content, and then somebody else can take care of the rest.\
\
[00:05:45.880] - Stephanie\
Either you're delegating it to an assistant to schedule that out, and then a tool like Plann, for example, that's what we use for social media. That takes care of scheduling it out for you at a later date, so you don't have to worry about it. So, those are a couple of very basic examples. Do you want me to get nerdy?\
\
[00:06:02.080] - Liz\
Yeah, get nerdy.\
\
[00:06:02.460] - Stephanie\
Okay. All right. Because then as you start to grow your business, you can start to add marketing funnels in, okay? So when we add these different funnels in, we can start with a Freebie or an Slo, which is a self liquidating offer. This is an offer on the front end that will bring people into your email list, and you can then nurture them to be a paying client. You could do this with a live launch. You could do this with an evergreen launch, or not necessarily evergreen launch, an evergreen marketing funnel. But essentially what you're doing is you're giving somebody the chance to opt into one thing. And I know a lot of bloggers do this to grow their email list, and then from there, you can send them down different routes based on how they identify themselves, essentially.\
\
[00:06:50.520] - Stephanie\
So, if they're like a beginning blogger, they can go down one funnel. If they're an intermediate blogger, they can go down another funnel. And then if they're more advanced, they can go down another funnel. All of these leads to your signature offer in some way, but it's all completely automated. Yeah, exactly.\
\
[00:07:07.010] - Liz\
Okay.\
\
[00:07:07.950] - Stephanie\
Exactly.\
\
[00:07:09.340] - Liz\
Oh, yeah. So, a couple of followup questions to some of the things you said.\
\
[00:07:12.660] - Liz\
I'm wondering if you can give some examples of things that you would eliminate or how you would decide that something should just be eliminated rather than delegated or automated.\
\
[00:07:22.390] - Stephanie\
So, my biggest question to you would be, does it result in money coming into your business? Is there a guaranteed return on your investment, either your investment of money or your investment of time? A lot of the time there's not. A lot of the things that I see people doing are like, I'm going to get a lot of back from the website designers in the group here, redesigning your website over and over again. You do not need to do that. You can put it up, it can live there for a couple of years. Once your brand grows and evolves and change, then you can change your website. Then you can update it. Your brand color, I see people tinkering with this all of the time and updating their logo. These are all things you don't need to be doing.\
\
[00:08:03.840] - Liz\
That's busy work that's procrastination in another form.\
\
[00:08:07.180] - Stephanie\
Exactly. And that's what people are doing. All of these things are things that can be eliminated, but they think they're necessary tasks to be working on. They're convincing themselves that these are the things that they need to be doing in order to grow their business. Because somebody on a podcast at one point told them that this is what they need to be doing. But these tasks are not actually aligned to their specific goals, right? So, everybody has a unique set of goals that they're working toward, and they have a unique set of tasks that need to be aligned with those goals. For example, if you let's just use the six-figure example. If you want to reach six figures and work less than 20 hours a week, there's really only two things you need to be doing. You need to focus on selling, and you need to focus on serving your clients. That's it. You don't need to focus on updating your website. You don't need to redo your logo a million and a half times. You don't even need a freebie at this point. Honestly, you can continue to do all of that on social media by selling through social media.\
\
[00:09:07.180] - Stephanie\
You don't even have to set up those complicated funnels that I just talked about. Right. So, don't get distracted by that. All you have to do is focus on having conversations with people, selling what you're great at, the offer that you have, and then serving those clients really well. Because what happens is those will turn into referrals, right? Those people will refer other people to you. So, hopefully, that simplifies it a bit for you.\
\
[00:09:30.130] - Liz\
Yes, I am going to be kind of devil's advocate because I feel like someone would be like, you make that sound really simple, you know just sell and whatever. But social media is hard and there's a gazillion different social media things and how do I do what, and which social media should I be doing? So, I feel like that's, yeah. But well, what if I'm not good at instagram.\
\
[00:09:51.860] - Stephanie\
Well, let's talk about it. So, if you're saying you're not good at Instagram, then you're just not trying hard enough. Frankly, you can watch a free YouTube video on anything these days to teach you how to do something. Now it all comes back to, like I said before, a six-figure signature offer. And knowing who you're speaking to, if you don't know who you're talking to, your content will never convert. So, you can spend hours and hours and hours creating content to post to social media, to send to your email list. But if what you're saying does not connect with somebody on that deep emotional, soul level, they will not buy from you. And this is where I see a lot of people getting hung up, is they don't know who they're talking to and they don't know how to talk to this person. So, when they're getting frustrated and saying they don't know how to use social media you know how to use social media. Everybody knows how to use social media. You log in, you create a post, you write...\
\
[00:10:44.700] - Liz\
Some people know more than others.\
\
[00:10:46.120] - Stephanie\
Okay. Some people know more than others. At a very basic level, you log in, you post an image, you put a caption up there, you would hit post. That's using social media. Right? So, at the end of the day, that's all you really have to do. Now from there, we also want to make sure we're having conversations with people, right? So, this is where it gets uncomfortable for people because people are afraid to have conversations with other people. They're afraid to put themselves out there and they're afraid to sell. So that's where the disconnect comes in that I see. They're afraid to sell and they don't know who they're talking to. So, yeah, that's when social media can be hard.\
\
[00:11:20.170] - Liz\
Okay, so what would you suggest are some exercises they could do if their content isn't converting like that, they're struggling with you know that connection to their audience and knowing where to find them. Because I think that directs kind of what social media you do as well. But what can they do to kind of get better at that and figure out what they're missing?\
\
[00:11:38.640] - Stephanie\
For sure. So, I have two pieces of advice. The first, look at the people that you enjoy following and ask yourself why you enjoy following them. There's usually like, I don't know, five to ten people that you are excited to look at, whether you're looking at their Instagram stories, whether you're opening up their emails. Ask yourself why, what kind of content is this person putting out that I enjoy reading, okay, or looking at, engaging with, whatever. And then the second part of that is when you're trying to figure out who you're marketing to, you need to, like I said, understand this person on a deep level. So I want you to write down 20 struggles that that person is experiencing right now. And again, we're not talking about more time or money, we want you to think deeper, right? So, we want you to think about, say you work with moms, I don't know and they want to lose weight. I don't know. So, I want you to put yourself in the shoes of this mom who is overweight. She's feeling like she's not going to be around when her kids grow up. She's feeling exhausted, she can't chase them around the yard.\
\
[00:12:44.170] - Stephanie\
She wants to eat healthy food, but she doesn't have the energy to cook the healthy food for herself. So, she's just continuing to eat the mac and cheese. Right? So, this is like the deeper level that we want to connect with them on. Not like, oh, you want to lose weight, do some situps while your kids napping. Right?\
\
[00:13:02.140] - Liz\
I want to nap while the kids napping is what they're thinking.\
\
[00:13:05.040] - Stephanie\
Right, exactly. Exactly. Exactly. But that's what people are saying, like they're talking on surface level, deeper, so that would be the second piece of advice to really dive, even put yourself in the shoes of that person. And a lot of the times, we are our own ideal client, which is great, so we could just look back on our own experiences to figure out what we went through and how we overcame that. And a lot of the times, it's going to connect with those people, too.\
\
[00:13:30.270] - Liz\
Yeah, I mean, I kind of like to think of it as like a toddler. You just need to when you think of a surface level, one ask, but why? And then the next one be like, but why?\
\
[00:13:39.850] - Stephanie\
Exactly.\
\
[00:13:40.480] - Liz\
Until you get to the root of what the real struggle is. And it's annoying when you do it to yourself, just like it's annoying when kids do it. But it's helpful for you. \
\
[00:13:53.360] - Stephanie\
Really is. And write down all of this.\
\
[00:13:54.880] - Liz\
Yeah.\
\
[00:13:55.150] - Stephanie\
Write down everything. Because you're going to realize that, like you said, there's layers underneath both layers. And you can always come back to this as you're creating more content. I revisit this, my Ideal client at least once a quarter, if not more than that, because things change in the world too, right? The world that we live in today is not the world we were living in a couple of years ago, right, so the struggles that people have are changing along with that.\
\
[00:14:21.340] - Liz\
Yes, agreed. I mean, the way the world's changed. Okay, so I think even knowing all those things, trying to keep organized and stick to a routine that supports it, what are some ways you see people struggle with that and some solutions you might have?\
\
[00:14:41.060] - Stephanie\
Well, again, we need to go back to what are the things that you need to be doing in order to grow your business? So, just start by making a list of these things. Very simple way to get started. Like make a list of everything you're working on right now. And then if you have team members, include the things that they're working on too, because we don't want to give unnecessary work to team members, right? And then divide it into three columns, like, what can I automate? What can I eliminate? And what can I delegate? And by the time you whittle that list down, there should not be more than like five to ten things that only you can be doing. But again, a lot of people think that there are all of these necessary things that they need to be doing, right? So, I would start there, just put it in black and white, get it out in front of you, so that you know where to go from there. And then the next thing, look at what your goals are for the next three months, and then whittle that list down even more. So, for example, if you want to make $10,000 in the next three months, what are the actions that you can take from that list that are actually aligned to reach that goal.\
\
[00:15:48.960] - Stephanie\
And nine times out of ten, it's going to come back to marketing your business and selling and actually having to have conversations with people. It's not going to be redesigning your website. It's not going to be taking new photos for your branding. None of that matters. But those are the fun things that people like to be doing and say that they actually need when they don't. You don't need to start a podcast. You don't need to create another course. You don't need to be doing any of those things. You need to actually talk to people. That's what it boils down to.\
\
[00:16:15.860] - Liz\
And maybe remind yourself that talking to people is what leads to the money hitting your account. And that's really fun too. So, maybe just reframe things a little bit.\
\
[00:16:23.440] - Stephanie\
Yes. Yes, exactly. Exactly. It's much more fun to have more money than it is to have not enough money telling you from experience. So, when in doubt, think about that. \
\
[00:16:35.290] - Liz\
Yes. Now, I find personally that 20 hours is a good amount of time. It sometimes feels like not enough, but some days it's just you're exhausted, you're done. Like how do you balance sort of the energy levels versus the things you need to do and sort of like juggle, that juggling act? Like, when do you say, well, it's not worth it for me to do today. Can it wait?\
\
[00:16:59.140] - Stephanie\
Well, yeah, I mean, again, it's going to depend on the type of business that you have. But I mean if you're doing work for a client and they're on deadline, maybe that can't wait. But if it's you writing content for your social media post next month, that can wait, right? I personally, if I don't have the energy to do something, I won't do anything at all, if it comes to the point of the day. And I know, even if I know that I have to do something, like, for example, write an email that needs to go out tomorrow, sometimes I just won't do it because I know that the energy that I put into it and the way that it will come across, it'll look desperate and it will look like I rushed through it and it won't convert anyway. So, I always like to wait until the next day, ideally in the morning, I'm a morning person, that's gonna work best until I have that energy, right? Because you can tell, you can tell when you're just like you're done and your brain stops working, you know. Like you're just done. And you don't want to force yourself to go through those just to go through the motions to do it, because it's not going to turn out well anyway.\
\
[00:18:03.760] - Stephanie\
Just give yourself a break. It's okay.\
\
[00:18:06.560] - Liz\
Yeah. Resting is sometimes the most productive thing you can do.\
\
[00:18:09.040] - Stephanie\
Absolutely. Yep.\
\
[00:18:11.440] - Liz\
Okay. Kind of a follow up to that because you noticed, you mentioned, oh, I got to write my social media content for next month. How far ahead are you focusing on you know the marketing stuff I'm doing today is really for going out a month or next week or how much of it is in real time versus being able to get ahead.\
\
[00:18:29.810] - Stephanie\
I always suggest having a 90 day marketing strategy. Now, this does not mean that you have to write your social media posts today for 90 days out. Because as we know, things change in the world, right? I always suggest having a strategy for 90 days and then you can always tweak it. You can move things around, things can change. That's totally fine. But in terms of the actual work that you're doing, I suggest doing that at least. It's hard to say, honestly, because if you're planning a launch, you need to plan that out. Right? A launch needs to be planned out like at least minimum two to three weeks, I would say. Right. But if you're just throwing up a social media post, a lot of people won't agree with me on this. I like to do it at the moment because that's when I feel inspired. I don't like to try to push myself to create content because if I do that, then it comes across as flat, right? What I personally like to do is I will take one day out of the month and create all of my content. But it needs to be a day when I'm inspired to create the content because if I'm not inspired, then I'm not going to do it.\
\
[00:19:36.400] - Stephanie\
So, like the scheduled post, I set aside one day and I get all of that content done in 2 hours. That's always my goal. All the content's done in 2 hours. And then like the one off post, like if I'm doing Instagram Reels or if I'm putting something on my stories, I'll just do that in the moment, whatever I feel like. I don't try to force myself to do that you know because it's not going to be fun. Business should be fun.\
\
[00:19:59.890] - Liz\
Yes. Yeah. You didn't get into it to just work yourself to death.\
\
[00:20:03.270] - Stephanie\
Exactly. Exactly. Yep.\
\
[00:20:06.040] - Liz\
Okay, so just kind of recapping some of the things that we talked about is if you want to run a six figure business and not work more than 20 hours a week and maybe even less, right, depending on where you're at and what you're doing.\
\
[00:20:18.160] - Stephanie\
I mean I work like 10 hours a week, so, I have clients that work five.\
\
[00:20:23.220] - Liz\
Soon to be less.\
\
[00:20:24.040] - Stephanie\
Yeah, exactly.\
\
[00:20:25.840] - Liz\
Is you need a single offer and not try to spread yourself across a variety of offers and constantly creating new offers. You need to get really good at selling that single offer and focus on marketing that. And those are really the primary things. And marketing obviously can look like a lot of different things. It can look like social media, it can look like list building and email. It can look like ads, it can , you know, can look like guest podcast, spot, whatever is going to work and is the easiest way to reach your ideal customer or client, depending on what your offer is. And then you said to take kind of all the things that are currently on your to do list that are probably just keeping you busy and either delegate, eliminate, or automate. I think that's really like the primary. Like, if you don't get anything else out of this session, those are the things you need to walk away with. Fair to say.\
\
[00:21:19.540] - Stephanie\
Exactly. That's fair to say, absolutely. And also another thing that pops up with people is once they start working less, it gets really uncomfortable for them because a lot of entrepreneurs are workaholics and they like to add more things to their schedule. So, it's really important to get comfortable with working less because that's why we built businesses in the first place to work less, not to work more than we were working at our nine to five job. So, I noticed that's another little bonus tip that I will add is to know that it's okay to work less and it's okay for you to be comfortable working less, too. That's like a big mindset thing that takes a lot of work, but we'll leave it at that.\
\
[00:22:03.250] - Liz\
Yeah. No, I think that's an excellent point, especially because as entrepreneurs, we're always thinking of new ideas and we want to act on them even when we haven't really fully solidified our six figure single offer that we need. You know, so write down your ideas, depending it until you've really gotten everything out of what you already have.\
\
[00:22:22.060] - Stephanie\
Yeah, I have a list. I come up with, my husband [inaudible 00:22:24]. I come up with new ideas all of the time. So, now I use ClickUp. So, now I just have a list in ClickUp in my business headquarters where I just write down all of my ideas. And there's probably at least 200 ideas in there right now. Guess how many I've actually used?\
\
[00:22:41.210] - Liz\
Two.\
\
[00:22:41.980] - Stephanie\
Maybe. Maybe because they're all brilliant ideas at the time.\
\
[00:22:48.110] - Liz\
Like bell curve, where it's like you're excited about something and then it drops. You know there's not a phenomenon that I can't pick up the name of, but yeah, you always want that high of the initial start, and so you constantly come up with stuff and then you don't see success with any of it.\
\
[00:23:01.690] - Stephanie\
Yeah, well, and I have ADHD, too, so it's like that dopamine hit, gets me so excited and I just want to go out and do all of the things.\
\
[00:23:08.220] - Liz\
Yes.\
\
[00:23:08.910] - Stephanie\
And then I'm like, you know take a step back. It's fine. The idea is going to be there tomorrow, and then tomorrow I don't care about it.\
\
[00:23:17.510] - Liz\
Yeah. Yeah. What I started doing is coming up with ideas for other people, right? I called them and be like, I have this great idea for you.\
\
[00:23:23.820] - Stephanie\
That's what I should do. I should just charge people and come up with ideas for them. Just like brainstorming sessions, because not a bad idea. I'll add it to my list.\
\
[00:23:34.390] - Liz\
We're setting a terrible example.\
\
[00:23:36.000] - Stephanie\
I know.\
\
[00:23:36.910] - Liz\
Okay, so I think all that was fantastic. Where else can people find you? You know what do you want to tell them? Final words?\
\
[00:23:45.710] - Stephanie\
Yeah. So, the best place to find me is on Instagram. My handle is at theblakecollective, and that's also my website, thebakecollective.com. And I have a free Facebook group if you want to come, join me there. It's called confidence CEOs. You can get that on my website as well. But I have a free gift for everybody as well, if you are interested in working these 20 hours or less weeks, it's called the 20 hours roadmap, and it breaks down the seven necessary steps that you need to take in order to work 20 hours or less a week. And then I also give seven of the biggest mistakes that I see people making that's holding them back. And I actually don't know if we talked about any of those in here, now that I think about it.\
\
[00:24:26.200] - Liz\
Do you want to cover one or two real quick?\
\
[00:24:28.560] - Stephanie\
Yeah, I can talk about one of them, but the roadmap, you can get it at 20hourroadmap.com.\
\
[00:24:33.450] - Liz\
And the links are all below. Perfect.\
\
[00:24:36.460] - Stephanie\
Yes, perfect. So one of the biggest things that I see people doing is undercharging. So that's probably the biggest one, undercharging for anything that they're creating, whether they're doing it done for you service, whether they have a course, whether they're doing one on one coaching and consulting. Far too many people are undercharging, and it's holding them back from reaching that six figure year, and it's just requiring them to do more work. So, more work in terms of marketing to sell a course, for example, more work in terms of taking on more one on one clients. It all comes back to raising your rates, but raising your rates in a way that's strategic, which also comes back to that six figure signature offer, right? Because you need to make sure it's a scalable offer, and a lot of the time, people's offers are not. So that's one little sneak peek preview from the mistakes there. But, yeah, definitely time for every single person watching this to raise your rates. 100%.\
\
[00:25:33.540] - Liz\
Yes, go do it and go grab that roadmap. It'll help you a lot. Stephanie, thank you again so much. I have notes of things that I need to do now, so thank you.\
\
[00:25:45.260] - Stephanie\
You are so welcome. Thank you again for having me. And if you're watching this, come say hey on Instagram. I love a chat with everybody.\
\
[00:25:51.640] - Liz\
All right, go do that, guys. And we will catch you in the chat and the Facebook group and all that fun stuff.\

\
**Transcript:**\
[00:00:03.280] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
All right, guys. I'm super excited to have this speaker back. She's spoken at the Blogger Breakthrough Summit before, I think, multiple times even really. I'm excited to welcome Steph Blake. She's the founder of Simple Business School and 20 Hour Week Club. She's a business coach and productivity expert who helps online business owners run simple, streamlined and profitable businesses in less than 20 hours a week. And she's been in business for over seven years. She is a tech nerd, system strategist, wife and mom. Steph, thank you so much for coming back.\
\
[00:00:43.670] - Steph Blake\
Yes, thank you for having me. I think this is year three or four. I don't know. I can't remember but I'm glad to be here.\
\
[00:00:49.460] - Liz\
I think it's the third one you've been in. This is the fifth Summit. That sounds about right. Because I think you did 2020, and I think you did last year also.\
\
[00:00:59.730] - Steph\
Yeah, I don't know. The years are all starting to blend together.\
\
[00:01:02.720] - Liz\
Right? They really are. And you just stop. I'm like, my camera is up here and I'm looking at you down here. So, today we're going to be talking about automations. The ability to automate things has expanded so much in the last couple of years. You throw in AI and it's like a whole other level. So, let's maybe start with just qualifying what you consider to be an automation, because I feel like some people view that differently sometimes.\
\
[00:01:36.400] - Steph\
That's a good question. So, when I think of an automation, in its most basic sense, I think of something that is happening without me. So, something is automating behind the scenes, the robots are doing their work so that something takes place without me having to manually do it. So, for example, we have automations in our lives and our businesses. Automations are everywhere, which is great and also sometimes not great. So, I guess we could talk about the pros and cons of automation as well as part of this. But yeah, I love automations. I could talk about this forever. As online business owners, if you don't have automation set up, you're working too much, honestly. You're working too much and you're likely spending too much money on team members that you don't need to be spending either. Because there are a lot of different tasks in your business that a robot could do for pennies on the dollar of what you're paying an actual human. And people might not be happy with me for saying that, but it's the truth, right? We're all business owners. We have to make a profit.\
\
[00:02:46.670] - Liz\
Yeah. And I will say it's not to say that you don't have things that humans can do, that you could then hand off to them so you're working less.\
\
[00:02:56.010] - Steph\
Totally.\
\
[00:02:57.030] - Liz\
I love automating. So, for this Summit, the initial transcript that's generated is done with AI. But then I pay humans to go through and make sure it's right. And it's a lot faster for them to go through and check what AI did than it is for them to by-hand transcribe. It's things like that, making AI or using automations and AI to make life easier and speed things up rather than take over necessarily, and that's how I like to view it.\
\
[00:03:24.950] - Steph\
Yeah. Totally.\
\
[00:03:26.160] - Liz\
So, automations are things that take place without you. I want to touch on before we get into what you think are the most helpful automations in business, we can maybe give some life examples just to get people thinking about it. But because I was just actually asked this question, is the difference between... Because automations are basically made up, correct me if I'm wrong, you've got triggers and you've got actions. And so what are the differences and how many of each? And I think people get tripped up trying to understand that context sometimes.\
\
[00:03:59.430] - Steph\
Yes. So, basically, a trigger is something that starts the process of an automation taking place. You can't have an automation run without something telling it to run. So, for example, if I wanted to bring new people onto my email list, I would need somebody to first enter their email address into the form. So, that's the trigger. And then the action would be take that email address, put it into my email marketing tool. So, very basic automation is something that every single online business owner should have in their arsenal. Everybody should have some kind of lead magnet to get people on your email list. And of course, this can get very complex very quickly. If you are techy and nerdy like I am, you can go down rabbit holes for hours and hours and hours to automate every part of your business. Now, one thing I do want to say is while I love automations, while they're incredibly important to have, don't forget that you are a human, right? And you want to give that human experience to the people who are in your world who are trusting you not only with their email address, but also their money. Right?\
\
[00:05:20.950] - Steph\
So, I think there is a really important blend of mixing automation with personalization. And yes, you can technically automate personalization, but there needs to be a healthy mix of the two. Again, at the most basic level, we have the trigger, like I said, the email address and the action, which is adding somebody to your email list. And then after that point, you can set up a whole host of different automations depending on what your goals are. But really, that's the first thing you need to figure out. What are your goals in your business? Not just how much time do you want to be working, but what are the goals? And that's honestly where it's tough to talk about automations because it's so unique to each person. It's so individualized, the specific automations that you need to have set up in your business. Does that make sense?\
\
[00:06:15.180] - Liz\
Yeah. No, because for bloggers, you might automate moving a blog post down the pipeline of getting it published, right? And that can involve lots of little, 'Hey, when I check this box, it's going to update the due date.' That can do all sorts of things. For me, for the Summit, I have an automation that, when I finish editing a video, I upload it to a folder. Then it uploads it to Vimeo and it uploads it to my transcription tool, and it goes and it finds the task in ClickUp and it checks a box. It can get crazy.\
\
[00:06:48.150] - Steph\
It can get really crazy and really out of control if you let it.\
\
[00:06:51.990] - Liz\
Let's try to talk about what you think are some specific automations that are most helpful when you're running an online business. \
\
[00:07:00.350] - Steph\
Yeah. So again, it really comes back to the type of business you have, what your goals are. However, I want to talk about tools first because I think that this is a good place to get started. So, my number one tool for automating is Zapier. I'm sure you're using Zapier in your business, right? And basically what Zapier does is it connects two apps together or two programs together that don't normally talk to each other, right? So, for example, if I have my landing page software and I want to connect it to my email tool, I can set up a form on my landing page software that will connect to my email via a Zap, it's what they're called.\
\
[00:07:45.290] - Liz\
I'm going to quickly share my screen so we can actually show visually what we're talking about.\
\
[00:07:50.440] - Steph\
Perfect. Thank you.\
\
[00:07:51.240] - Liz\
So, here's Zapier, right? One of the things I love about Zapier is figuring out what I can do.\
\
[00:07:58.500] - Steph\
Yes. And they just released this AI thing.\
\
[00:08:01.100] - Liz\
Yeah. I've barely touched the AI. But if you have a landing page tool, say you're using Leadpages, which I don't use. Are they on here? Yeah, they are. Of course, they are.\
\
[00:08:11.690] - Steph\
Pretty much everything is in Zapier, which makes it great. \
\
[00:08:15.550] - Liz\
Except Canva. That's the one thing. Oh, my God. If Canva got in Zapier, I wouldn't know what to do with myself. But you can see it says triggers and actions, right? Because I've got to think, 'Okay, what do I want? What is the trigger?' The thing that I'm going to end up doing anyway to kick this off or that is going to kick it off? And then looking at the actions, right? So, you say new form submission, and then what did you want to connect it with?\
\
[00:08:44.540] - Steph\
Let's say ConvertKit. Or what email tool do you use? Do you use ConvertKit?\
\
[00:08:47.830] - Liz\
I use ConvertKit. I love ConvertKit. \
\
[00:08:50.360] - Steph\
Okay, cool. So, then let's connect that to ConvertKit.\
\
[00:08:52.190] - Liz\
Right.\
\
[00:08:55.170] - Steph\
So, that is connecting your landing page tool where you collect that customer information to your email marketing tool.\
\
[00:08:59.560] - Liz\
Yeah. So, if you're doing lead pages as the trigger, then as the action, you can do any and all. \
\
[00:09:06.510] - Steph\
All of those different things.\
\
[00:09:07.600] - Liz\
I will say if you're on the free plan of Zapier, you can do one thing at a time. You can only do a single-step Zap. If you're on the paid plan, you can do all the things, basically.\
\
[00:09:18.440] - Steph\
And you can create fun paths and lots of other exciting things inside of there, too. Yes. Yeah, we'll get there later. \
\
[00:09:25.430] - Liz\
So, if you're curious about what a tool can do in Zapier, just look up the tool and then scroll down to triggers and automations. And if the trigger is what you want, go look up the other tool you want to connect and see what the actions are, right? Because it's not exclusive to the ideas that are listed here. It's just giving you ideas.\
\
[00:09:47.260] - Steph\
Right. Well, the most popular tools have a Zapier integration. Other ones, they may not have a direct integration. Now, I don't want to get too complicated here, but they may have either, one, a private invite where you can get access to behind the scenes. So, it may not show up when you're doing a search. So, that's something you can reach out to that tool and ask. Or, you can set up what's called a webhook. And that could also... But again, I don't want to get too technical with that. But there we go. So there's a webhook right there. So, there are ways to work around it if the tools aren't in there.\
\
[00:10:25.730] - Liz\
Yeah. And I wouldn't say you need to have a solid understanding of API documents and webhooks to use them. If you can copy and paste and you can Google, you're good. Some of them are easy, just, 'Oh, I just got to copy and paste that.' Other times you're like, 'How do I?' And you can find someone that did a video for you on YouTube or something.\
\
[00:10:44.790] - Steph\
Exactly.\
\
[00:10:45.160] - Liz\
So, don't let, "Oh, it's only through webhook." Stop you from trying to automate that, because you don't have to know everything about webhooks to get it to work.\
\
[00:10:57.040] - Steph\
You don't. You don't. Not at all. Do you have a more complex one that we can show people just to give an example?\
\
[00:11:07.970] - Liz\
Yes. Let me pull up the one I did. Nope, that's not the one I want. Hold on. Go back. Go back. What was the one? I set up a six-step. Here we go. So, this is a multistep. It doesn't have a path, but I have ones that have paths. So, this includes formatting. There's a lot it does. Or do you want me to try to pull up one that has a path?\
\
[00:11:38.210] - Steph\
No, I mean, this is fine. I just wanted to show more than one step. So, you can see here when there's a new video in Vimeo, it's going to complete all of these different steps for her. So, this is where the automation comes in, it's where all of these things are happening behind the scenes without her having to do it or a physical person having to do it\
\
[00:11:55.190] - Liz\
All I have to do is save the file with the file name format that I've decided to make this work, to this Dropbox folder, and then it does all these things.\
\
[00:12:06.000] - Steph\
Exactly, which is amazing. So, if you think about it, if you multiply the time that it would take to do all of these different steps, how long do you think this specific step would take you if you were doing it manually?\
\
[00:12:19.430] - Liz\
Oh, well, I'd have to sit there and wait for it to upload to these. So, that's at least five minutes each. How long it took me to set this up? But this I could probably do a little faster maybe, but I'd say it's at least 10-15 minutes times 50 sessions.\
\
[00:12:41.420] - Steph\
Right. Exactly. So, that's too much math for me to figure out.\
\
[00:12:46.430] - Liz\
Yeah, I was like...Uh.\
\
[00:12:47.510] - Steph\
And on top of that, all of the context switching too. So, we're going back and forth. So, for example, if she was uploading this video on Vimeo, she probably wouldn't sit there and watch it. She'd probably be doing something else, right? So, when she's working on that other task, she's actually not as productive because she has her attention split. \
\
[00:13:06.380] - Liz\
Monitoring to make sure it uploads correctly.\
\
[00:13:09.340] - Steph\
Exactly. Exactly. So, that's why this is so incredible. Now, for example, if there was a task down at the bottom that said, create a new ClickUp task, and there were...\
\
[00:13:21.490] - Liz\
Well.\
\
[00:13:23.100] - Steph\
Subtasks in there that were assigned to her team members.\
\
[00:13:25.610] - Liz\
Hold the phone. Because when it updates this task in ClickUp, I have an automation in ClickUp to update things.\
\
[00:13:32.590] - Steph\
Okay. All right. So, now we're just getting really wild and crazy right now.\
\
[00:13:35.900] - Liz\
I know. I'm sorry.\
\
[00:13:36.950] - Steph\
But basically, to keep it simple. At the very end, if she had - say, step number 8 was to create a task in ClickUp - and she pulled a template that she had already created in ClickUp, maybe there were team members assigned to it, right? So, then that would automatically create that task for the team members to work on. So, she wouldn't have to manually go in and create that task. So, that's where we blend the two together with the automation, but then having those manual. And that's just one example. One example of that.\
\
[00:14:07.940] - Liz\
Zapier and ClickUp automations, I use them so much.\
\
[00:14:13.510] - Steph\
I use Airtable too. \
\
[00:14:16.170] - Liz\
I should be using Airtable better, but I don't. Between ClickUp and Zapier, the number of automations I can do and the things I could not have to do manually... I mean, even in ClickUp, say I checked the box that this got uploaded, well, then the processing status needs to change. And no, it wouldn't take me that long to do that. That's one less thing to do if it just automatically, when I check the box, moves it along.\
\
[00:14:44.170] - Steph\
Right. And I mean, again, it's not that it takes a lot of time to do these things. It's about being productive during your working hours. And that can lead us into an entirely different conversation, which we don't have to get into right now. But that's really what it's all about, right? We have these businesses, these online businesses so that we can have more time and freedom. So, when you can create automations for your specific business to take that time off of your plate, again, that's 50 times however many - a zillion hours, we're just going to say a zillion hours of work. \
\
[00:15:18.350] - Liz\
Right! And that's for a Summit that I run once a year. If you're doing a blog post, which you're hopefully... The key to success in online, really, an online business is consistency. So, for every blog post, you're going to have to do similar tasks. Even just the checkboxes. How many of those can you automate once you've done something? And that's over and over throughout the year, year after year. Whereas my Summit, my automations adjust a little every year, but each year I automate more and more. The first year of the Summit, I had a VA that probably did at least 60 or 70 hours towards the Summit. Last year I think the VA did two.\
\
[00:16:01.580] - Steph\
Right. And then you're paying for, I'm sure, like Zapier.\
\
[00:16:06.310] - Liz\
Yeah, I'm on the pro level of Zapier. So it's not cheap. But honestly, for all the stuff that it does, it's way easier.\
\
[00:16:14.350] - Steph\
Yeah, so it's way less than what you would be paying your team member to do.\
\
[00:16:19.200] - Liz\
Yeah.\
\
[00:16:20.030] - Steph\
Absolutely. Now, again, when it comes to creating the specific automations for your business, I don't have this automation set up in my business because I don't need this specific automation, right? Now, for example, I have bundles that I host and I will have automations that are specific to that. Or I have memberships, and when people come in and join my memberships, I have automations specific to that. So, again, that's why it's so important to know what your goals are in order to strategically create automations that work for you. And then also that...Yeah, go ahead.\
\
[00:16:53.160] - Liz\
I was just going to say, another thing that I think is great to automate, that I was way too slow to the game on, is creating databases of your work so you're not having to reinvent the wheel and find things. So, anytime I publish a new blog post, it gets added to a list and ClickUp so that I can track, okay, it hasn't been indexed by Google yet. I'm not having to go and copy and paste the link and pull it into... It just automatically does that for my broadcast to ConvertKit. Because I love, love, love ConvertKit, but if ConvertKit had a few more organizational features, I'd love it even more. I have an email broadcast database in ClickUp, and I can go and it pulls it in and it's like, here's the subject, here's the content, and here's the link so that I can go pull it open in ConvertKit if I want. And then I go in and I'll add the open rate and what it was on and what product it mentioned. So, the next time I run a sale on that product, I can be like, 'Hey, which one worked best?'\
\
[00:17:53.270] - Liz\
And I'm not having to start from scratch. So, using automation is just to create databases of the things you create, which is very meta, I think, in what I just said. It's a huge time saver in the future.\
\
[00:18:07.370] - Steph\
It really is. Yeah, absolutely. And there are so many different ways we can... I know a lot of your people don't do any service-based work where they're working with clients or anything. It's more digital, right?\
\
[00:18:18.560] - Liz\
I mean, it varies, right? So, we always get a mix. But I think the focus of the Summit is more content creation based probably.\
\
[00:18:29.270] - Steph\
Yeah. I mean, well, regardless of whether you have customers or clients, I like to differentiate the two. I don't know why. Clients are people I work with more closely.\
\
[00:18:38.040] - Liz\
That's like a one-on-one relationship, whereas customers could be more of a one-to-many, I feel like.\
\
[00:18:42.770] - Steph\
Right. Yeah, exactly. Like a digital product, like a course that you sell. In my mind, that's more of a customer. But either way, you need to have an onboarding process for that group of people. So again, that could be automating the entire process of getting them onto your email list and capturing the payment for the digital product, nurturing them until they're ready to purchase that product. So, from the moment you capture their email address, you can then create different automations- different funnels in your email service provider - that can do the work for you behind the scenes to nurture those people until they're ready to buy and purchase. So, that's something that's happening more behind the scenes on a mass scale versus something like this with Zaps, where it's very specific to one thing. Right? So yeah.\
\
[00:19:32.830] - Liz\
I mean, I can up ConvertKit too.\
\
[00:19:36.390] - Steph\
Yeah, that's fine.\
\
[00:19:38.260] - Liz\
But yeah, I would say most tools have some form of automation, whether or not they call it automation. Like with Convertkit, yeah, there's an automation section, but there are also rules, which is what they started with. They didn't use to have visual automations. And I've been on ConvertKit so long I know that. There are rules. Like ThriveCart, if you're using that, you can automatically send someone to ConvertKit to start the product onboarding sequence. ClickUp has automations. If you're not a ClickUp person, don't worry. Trello has automations, Asana has automations. Gmail has filters and things, which are automations.\
\
[00:20:20.140] - Steph\
Yes, exactly. \
\
[00:20:22.230] - Liz\
That can save you so much time. Okay, I feel like we really started getting into the weeds.\
\
[00:20:29.590] - Steph\
Yes, I know. This can go in so many different directions. It's really hard to get it in.\
\
[00:20:35.250] - Liz\
Honestly, I'm like, 'Wait, I can automate that.' And then I take the time to automate it. I'll be honest, I hate setting up automations. I really do. It's so tedious to get it, to test it, make sure it's working. But I love them once they're working. It is so nice.\
\
[00:20:52.770] - Steph\
I love setting them up.\
\
[00:20:53.450] - Liz\
I hate to set them up, but I love to watch them work.\
\
[00:20:58.510] - Steph\
Actually, what you said right there was really great because you said as you're just going through your day-to-day process, ask yourself, can this be automated? Yes or no? If your answer is no, then you can step back. Ask yourself that again. Do you actually have to be the one doing it? And if a human being does have to do it, maybe doesn't have to be you. Maybe it can be a team member. And maybe there's a part of that process that can be automated. So, maybe it doesn't have to be the entire process. I want people to just think about this from a different perspective instead of thinking that robots are completely taking over the back end of their business and they don't talk to anybody. That's not the case. For example, as a photographer - that was just the first example that came to my mind - you want to make sure that you're having some relationship with your clients, but you don't have to be the one sending them the onboarding form to fill out their questions or whatever you need to know, right? You don't need to be the one sending them a gift. There's a lot of different parts that you don't need to be doing.\
\
[00:22:03.170] - Liz\
Yeah. I mean, the other day I was like, 'My inbox has gotten out of control and I'm losing track of things I need to pay attention to.' And I was like, 'Oh, I need to just go update the filters so that the new newsletters I sign up for skip that part of my inbox and are just there ready for me when I want to look at that.'\
\
[00:22:22.580] - Steph\
Yeah, exactly.\
\
[00:22:23.710] - Liz\
So it's an ongoing thing. It's not necessarily a set-and-forget, but it's' ongoing and can be improved and better and added to.\
\
[00:22:32.590] - Steph\
Yeah. I mean, just using the Summit as an example. The first time that you ran the Summit, you didn't have that many automations, I would guess, because you didn't really know what you needed. You were just piecing it together. Now, five years later, it's like everything's streamlined. \
\
[00:22:49.310] - Liz\
As much as possible!\
\
[00:22:50.780] - Steph\
Exactly. Exactly. So, if you're brand new to automation, you're brand new, I mean, even to business, you've been doing things on your own for a long time, just also give yourself a break. This is something new that you're learning. You don't have to have all of the answers right away. Go into Zapier, see if two things can connect. Start there. \
\
[00:23:15.860] - Liz\
Yeah. Yeah. And on the free Zapier plan, because I'm always mindful, especially if your blog isn't earning money yet. Although if your blog can cover the 20 bucks a month, I think, 20 bucks a month on the annual plan, 30 bucks a month on Zapier. I was just looking at this. Then it's worth it. Pay for it.\
\
[00:23:32.740] - Steph\
Oh, yeah.\
\
[00:23:33.640] - Liz\
If you're not earning any money, still use the free plan. That's five things you can automate for free, right? Clickup has, I think, you get 50 different automation tasks and a hundred instances a month for free, right? I think Make even has a free plan. So, if you really wanted to, you could really bootstrap with multiple tools. I don't know if Pavely has a free plan.\
\
[00:24:02.890] - Steph\
They just have the lifetime access, I think.\
\
[00:24:05.250] - Liz\
Okay. You can really bootstrap and get a lot of free automations if you're willing to be a little creative and dig in to the functionality of the tools you're using. I wouldn't say switch a tool simply for free automation, because especially things like email marketing, go with what you're going to stick with. That'll slow down your progress. That's a whole other conversation for another day. Okay, you may or may not have a good answer for this. What are five places they should start to look at automating?\
\
[00:24:51.010] - Steph\
So first, I'm trying to...I'm assuming there are a lot of bloggers here, right? So, your automation that you mentioned with pulling the copy from your blog and then adding in the link. I'll be honest, I'm not a big blogger, but I know you said that you have an automation specifically for that. So, where after the blog post is published, it will pull the link and it will add that into your database, right?\
\
[00:25:19.910] - Liz\
Yes.\
\
[00:25:20.200] - Steph\
Okay, so that's one. For bloggers specifically, use that because you need to track the data to make sure that your blog posts are working, right? You need to have that. Also, you need to be marketing your business. So, using social media scheduling tools, we didn't talk about that, but that's also part of the consistency portion, right? So, if you want put your blog post on Pinterest, that is something that you can automate. You can take that blog post after it is posted to your blog and automatically upload it to Pinterest. That is not something that you manually need to be doing. You can also create an Instagram post or a Facebook post or whatever, wherever your audience is at, you can create social media content from it. \
\
[00:26:06.110] - Liz\
And again, with free tools.\
\
[00:26:08.870] - Steph\
Yes. Exactly.\
\
[00:26:09.490] - Liz\
The extent of how many things you can do. So, the reason I have paid levels of tools, right? My business is almost 10 years old. I have four different websites. I run a Summit. I need the higher volume of things. But if you have one blog with free tools, like Facebook Business, whatever, you can schedule Instagram in Facebook. There are a lot of different ways to approach that. I always like to point out, because when we're talking about tools and stuff, people can get overwhelmed. I think they need to spend a lot of money and you don't.\
\
[00:26:43.490] - Steph\
For sure. Yeah, you definitely don't. Eventually, will you as your business grows? Yeah. But that comes with the territory, depending on what your goals are, what your business model is, and all of that. Another big one, I'm assuming you will be selling something of some kind and you need to deliver a product to that person. So, whether you create a small course, whether you create a freebie, you need to have some kind of onboarding process. Again, whether it's a freebie or paid product, that is a non-negotiable. Because the last thing that you want is somebody saying, 'Hey, I signed up for this. I downloaded this, and I'm not getting it.' Because that's just a customer service nightmare that you don't want to deal with. Another one is... I'm looking at my notes right here. So, this is a fun one. This is just a bonus one that I really like that automates. My main social media platform is Instagram. So, you can actually set up an automation inside of Instagram. When somebody says a keyword, it will deliver a specific message to them. So, for example, if you are running the Summit, if you put a post up on Instagram and you say leave a comment with the word Summit, anybody who leaves a comment with that word Summit, it will send them a message, a direct message with a link to say, 'Hey, sign up for the Summit here.' So that automates your lead generation and even selling process for you. \
\
[00:28:12.360] - Liz\
So, I see those posts. I had no idea that was an automated thing. That makes a lot more sense. You could tell that I'm not on Instagram and I'm terrible at it. It's a goal. It's always been a goal. The last four years of the Summit, you will see videos of me being like, 'Oh, I want to be better at Instagram.' It just hasn't happened. Of course, it's going to be automated. Who has time for that?\
\
[00:28:31.630] - Steph\
So, the funny thing is... Funny thing. So, not everybody automates it. So, this is a whole other conversation. But there are a lot of people copying what other people do, copying strategies, but not knowing how to actually implement them on the backend. That's a big one that I see. People will say, comment with word, somebody comments, and then nothing happens, because they're manually following up with those people instead of actually setting up the automation in the background. So, that's a whole other conversation that we can dive into. But yes. So ideally, if you see that set up somewhere, there should be an automation that delivers that to you. And let me see what else. Those are really the main ones. We need to make sure that your content is getting out. We need to make sure that you're getting paid. We need to make sure that you have lead generation happening, whether that's for freebies or paid products. We always need to make sure that things are running in the background. And the most important things are leads, potential clients, money and clients. Or else you don't have a business. You just have a very, very, very expensive hobby. Right?\
\
[00:29:41.250] - Steph\
So that's, again, why it's so important to go back to what your goals are and then just ask yourself, 'Okay, I'm creating 10 blog posts a week.' That sounds insane. 'I'm creating 10 blog posts a week. What parts of this process are taking me a lot of time?' Right? So, if uploading the blog post is taking you a lot of time, all right, let's take a step back. What parts of this process can we automate? And again, if you don't know, Google it. Literally, go into Google - how to automate my blog post? You're going to get 10,000 articles. You're going to get 50,000 YouTube videos. People will show you how to do these things. There are videos, there are references for doing everything. But again, you have to take a step back and you have to figure out what those things are that need to be automated in your business. \
\
[00:30:30.930] - Liz\
Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's fantastic. All right. So, I think we've covered a lot. And hopefully people aren't overwhelmed. Seriously, if you guys have questions, drop them in the Facebook group, drop them in the chat. Pretty sure both Steph and I love to talk about it. Like I said, I'll talk about it. I love watching them work. I hate setting them up. I will do it, but I hate it.\
\
[00:30:56.330] - Steph\
I love all of the parts.\
\
[00:30:58.220] - Liz\
So, between the two of us, I'm sure we can get your question answered. Thank you so much for coming back again. I know you've got something for attendees and then something for those that get the Speaker Bonus Bundle. You want to share those things?\
\
[00:31:15.190] - Steph\
Yeah, absolutely. So, my whole thing is helping business owners run simple, streamlined, and profitable businesses in 20 hours a week. So, the free gift that I'm giving is a workshop, and it's called it's called the Simple Business Workshop. You can get it at 20hourweektraining.com. And it really focuses on helping you figure out exactly what you need to focus on in your business, so that you can start seeing results without working a zillion and a half hours a week. Because I've been there, I've worked the 80 to 100 hours a week. Not fun, not necessary. And yes, automations are part of that, but there are also a lot of other strategic considerations to remember. And so, that workshop really dives into setting up the foundations of your business, using strategy, and then from there, that's when we can start to add in those additional elements like automations and whatnot. So, that is the free gift I'm giving. And for the little bonus gift I'm giving, it's called Automating Your Online Business. And that really takes everything that we've talked about to the next level. It's a training. So, it has a very concise overview of what automations are in your business, and how to figure out the specific automations that you need for your business.\
\
[00:32:38.430] - Steph\
So, I have a formula that I use in that training and I break it down for you. I also give a bunch of examples of different automations that you can use in your business. So, it's really good. It really takes this conversation to the next level in a more concise way. So, we were all over the place with what we were talking about. So, that will really help you get started. \
\
[00:32:58.160] - Liz\
That was all good.\
\
[00:32:58.490] - Steph\
Yeah. No, it's all great. It's all really, really great. But that will help you really get started with figuring out exactly what you want to automate your business.\
\
[00:33:06.500] - Liz\
All right. So, guys, definitely the links are below to the free gifts that she has for you guys. And then if you haven't upgraded to the Speaker Bonus Bundle or the annual plan of the Blogger Breakthrough Summit membership, go do that because that comes with the Speaker Bonus Bundle, and you'll get access to that awesome training as well. So again, Steph, thank you so much. And everyone, if you have questions, let us know.\

All.\
\
[00:00:00.250] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
Right, guys. I'm excited to share this next session with you from Stephanie. Welcome, Stephanie.\
\
[00:00:07.340] - Steph Blake\
Hi. Thanks for having me. I'm excited.\
\
[00:00:09.620] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
Yes, because you are going to be talking about creating scalable systems and increasing your profits because systems are so essential to scaling, period. You can't keep doing one-off stuff. You're not going to get very far fast. So can you give us a highlight of what you're going to cover in the session?\
\
[00:00:27.870] - Steph Blake\
Yeah. So there's three big things that you're going to learn throughout it. And the first is the importance of using a digital project management tool in your business and getting out of your pretty printed planner.\
\
[00:00:39.970] - Steph Blake\
So.\
\
[00:00:40.540] - Steph Blake\
We're taking it online, we're getting digital.\
\
[00:00:42.460] - Speaker 1\
The.\
\
[00:00:43.120] - Steph Blake\
Second thing is to know what to work on each and every day because that's something that a lot of entrepreneurs struggle with. They don't know what to do. They're just all over the place. And then the third is why automations are crucial for creating a scalable business. So we are diving into all of those and I cannot wait for you guys to watch it.\
\
[00:01:04.470] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
Yes. Let's go ahead and get started.\
\
[00:01:07.100] - Steph Blake\
So before we dive into all of that, I want to introduce myself. My name is Stephanie, Blake, and I help entrepreneurs scale to $5K plus months by creating scalable systems in their business. Now I love free classes like this. I mean, who doesn't love to get a ton of great information for free? But where I really like to hang out and chat with you one on one is on Instagram. That is my jam. So if you could right now, go ahead and snap a photo of this slide as you're watching it and tag me on Instagram stories. My handle is @theblakecollective. So once you do that, I will pop into your DMs and say, hey, and answer any questions that you have about this training and just chat with you and get to know you a little bit better. So let me ask you a question first. Do these photos look familiar to you? Countless papers and Post-it's covering your desk because you don't have a system to keep them organized? Or maybe you have a printed planner that you keep everything in. But I'm sorry to break it to you. That pretty printed planner just isn't cutting it to help you reach those big goals for your business.\
\
[00:02:23.430] - Steph Blake\
A physical planner can be supplementary. Don't get me wrong. But it cannot be the main way that you organize and automate the projects in your business. And this comes from somebody who had every single planner under the sun. Sure, they were filled with lots of pretty colored pens and stickers, but none of these planners set me up for success like a digital tool could. In order to run a successful business, you need to be planning for long term success, not on a day to day basis. And you cannot reach your goals, your long term goals, your freedom goals that you're working so hard for by only planning one week at a time or even one month at a time. You need to be planning on a long term basis. I'm talking quarters, even a year at a time. And then planning out those projects and then working backwards from them in order to reach your goals. But with that said, not all project management tools are created equal. And I'm sure that many of you have actually been wasting your time instead of saving it by signing up for a bunch of different tools. What is my favorite tool?\
\
[00:03:37.550] - Steph Blake\
And it is ClickUp. It is, I'm telling you from experience, the only project management tool that I use and recommend because it not only allows you to keep track of your projects and tasks, it also holds you accountable to completing them. And the whole point of using a tool, any tools to make sure that you complete the tasks within it. So we will be talking a little bit more about this, but I like to think of it as if I'm sure you've heard of Trello or Asana, those are some other popular ones. So if Trello and Asana had a baby, this would be it. Plus, it's free. So why wouldn't you do it? You want to make sure that even I know a lot of you are in the beginning stages of your business. So you want to make sure that you're setting yourself up for success, right? Because once you start to grow and you get busier and you have more clients, you won't want to worry about doing simple things like transferring over your project management tool. So I highly recommend starting out with this free tool, getting all of your information into it.\
\
[00:04:43.540] - Steph Blake\
And as you grow and scale, you can use more capabilities of it. Now, speaking of that, it is not just enough to focus on or to have a product management role. You also need to know what to focus on that is generating the most revenue. So you need to focus on IPAs or income producing activities in your business. And these are tasks that actually generate revenue for your business, not the things that you think do or the things that are quote-unquote, safe, like redesigning your website for the fifth time, or creating your logo again. Those things aren't actually making you money. So that is why I created something called Organize in Five. And it is a five-part framework to organizing your business and setting it up for success so you can scale it. So this system teaches you the importance of brain dumping. So you can clear the clutter from your head. How to focus on the income producing activities in your business, also known as those IPAs, setting up processes and templates so you're not recreating the wheel every single time you work on a project. And utilizing ClickUp in a way that ensures you get those IPAs completed.\
\
[00:06:02.660] - Steph Blake\
So part one is dump it. And this is where you're going to get everything out of your head and onto a sheet of paper or into a Google Doc. After that, you are going to color it. You're going to highlight all of the revenue generating activities in your business. Next, you are going to outline it. And by that, I mean, once those IPAs or those money makers are covered, you are going to list out all of the tasks that go into those. And there shouldn't be too many. There should only be between five and 10 of those. No more than that. After that, you are going to load it. So if you have all of your tasks outlined, you are going to put them into your project management tool, aka ClickUp.\
\
[00:06:49.310] - Steph Blake\
I really recommend it. And it's extremely easy to set up and you can start using it right away. So as I said before, this is by far the best project management platform that I've used because of the flexibility that it allows for any business. So let's just start with a quick tour of the platform. So in terms of the hierarchy of ClickUp, you have spaces, which I am in a space right now. And then you have folders. You can see the space right here. It's called Blog. And then you have the folders within there, and they have dropdowns. And then you have lists, which are these items right here. And then within those, you have tasks. So if you click to open, you can see there's more information there. So it goes to space, and then folder, list, and Tasks. Like I said, there's unlimited ways to set this up. But I'm just going to give you a very simplistic overview to start with, and then you can dive into it and do really whatever you want to customize it for your business. So the biggest difference between folders right here and lists are that the folders contain the items within them.\
\
[00:08:10.190] - Steph Blake\
So these list items are in the folder. Think of it similar to a file folder with papers inside of it. But these papers are more robust than just a simple piece of paper. So you have your folder, and then you have your, quote-unquote, pieces of paper within them. And from there, you have the task within. So once you click on a task, you can see that it opens it up and it presents even more ways to use it. So up at the top, you have the name of the item or the task. You have the status of where it falls on your list. And then you can also put descriptions in here. This is a description. You can put whatever information you want in there. You can also add subtasks, which are great. I'll show you. So once you add one in, it gives you other options to do. So you can see as I'm continuing to dive into the different parts, there's so many different ways to use this. But my favorite way to personally use subtasks is to set dates to them. So you can click, Set a date, and you can see that it gives you a lot of different options.\
\
[00:09:26.660] - Steph Blake\
So you can choose a predetermined date. You can choose later tomorrow, this weekend. So many different ways to use it. You can also set recurring tasks in here. That is that. You can also add little checklist, too. So we'll just call that a checklist. Or if you want to pull from the templates that you saved, you would just click that. I'll just say item one, item two. And then you can also assign these items in the checklist to other people on your team. You can also add attachments. If you want to add an attachment from any of these different areas, you can. Or if you wanted to comment, you can do that as well. So if you have team members that you wanted to share general information with, or say, for example, you have this blog post and you tag their name and you say, Tiffany, can you review? So that way, you don't have to be going back and forth over email. You can just have everything in one easy place to access for everybody, not just you, but everybody on your team as well. The next thing I wanted to quickly talk about was statuses.\
\
[00:10:39.190] - Steph Blake\
So you can see that I created a couple of example statuses here, but you can change those in the space setting or in the individual folder setting. So I'm going to show you how to do that in this space. So if you click these little ellipses right here, you go to space settings, and this gives you all of the the details for your space. So you can change the name, you can give access to different people. And then down here under task statuses is where you can change the status. So I just added a few examples... I have a couple ones here, just different aspects of creating blog posts. And you could just hit review changes and then it'll pop up with this box again. So as you can see, I know I keep saying this, but there's really so many different ways that you can use this for your business. You can add additional spaces here for, for example, we'll call this your biz HQ. So maybe this is where you have your media kit, any financial information, whatever it is, whatever you want to put a little piece of pizza there for that icon.\
\
[00:11:52.440] - Steph Blake\
We'll just do that. If you want to add custom statuses, you can do that when you create the space or afterward, like I just showed you. And then you also have different click apps that you can enable. So you can enable the ability to have multiple assignees on projects. You can add time tracking, time tracking rollup priority. There's so many different options that you can have, including custom fields, too. So if you don't see something here that you want, you can create a completely custom field for it. And then you get different views to view your space in. So list is always the default, and that's what we're looking at back here, but I'll go back to that in a second. And then if you like the Kanban style, that's what the board is for. So you can tick that on or you can turn it off. And then calendar, that's another option. So if you want all of those on, you can have all of them. If you only want the list view, you can have just the list view. But we're going to create it with those right now so that you can see when this space pops up, you would just go here and you would create a new folder.\
\
[00:13:08.250] - Steph Blake\
And then it automatically creates a list for you within there. And see, it also created the board view. So let's go back to this blog example that I created, and you can see that when I click Board View, you can see how there's boards here. So if you've used Trello in the past, this is very similar to that, where you can just simply drag and drop to different areas just depending on the status of the task. This is, List view is personally my favorite to use when it comes to different admin tasks, my business. But for content marketing, I definitely like the Board view just because it gives me an overview. Let me collapse these so you can see. It just gives you a really easy way to see where everything's at just at a glance. You can also collapse these. The to-do and the complete are just general statuses that it gives you once you start out. And then you can customize it from there. But yeah, I really like this view. I think it just makes things really, really easy. But let's add a couple of different views just to see what they look like.\
\
[00:14:25.490] - Steph Blake\
We can add a calendar view. When we go back and assign, let's assign a due date to this so you can see what it looks like. The cool thing about ClickUp is that you can do a start date and an end date or a due date. Let's do a start date of today and then an end date. We're saying that our project will take about five days to complete, but it's due on Friday, the 31st. We're going to close that. Then once we go to the calendar view, you can see that it popped up right here. You know that you have slotted out the time in your calendar to work on this project. I love using calendar view. I'm such a nerd. I love to color code and use different colors for different statuses so that when I do go to my calendar, everything is right there and really easy to see. Another option is the box view. I've created a sample space. Let me see. Let's see if it'll let me... Oh, there we go. It will let me do it. But you can see who is working on each project. If you have a team, it'll break this down for you.\
\
[00:15:39.440] - Steph Blake\
It'll say you and it'll say another team member here, another team member here, and it just breaks it down into every single person that's on your team and what they're working on. You can see where the different status is at for different projects, who is working on what. It's amazing, and it's a really easy way to just glance at something so you don't have to go back and forth and talk and ask them about it. Another one is the Gantt View, if you are familiar with Gantt charts. It breaks it down right here for you, too. There's a lot of different options that you can choose from, and these are completely customizable for each of your folders. If I go down to February, you can see that there's only the list and the board view. But when I go up to January, it has all of them here. You can customize it however you want for your business. Another thing that is very, very cool is the page views. We're going to talk about these for just a quick second. I personally love Docs. This has replaced Google Docs for me just because it's so easy to keep everything in one place.\
\
[00:16:58.300] - Steph Blake\
So you can change the name of this to be blog docs. I don't know. We'll just call it that for right now. And then within here, you can have different pages. So we'll call it page one, page two, page three. So see how everything is just in one very easy to access space. You don't have to go back and forth. You don't have to open up multiple tabs. Everything is in here for you. With that said, if you do prefer to use Google Docs, that's great. I created a little example here for us. I'm going to copy that. I'm going to show you how the embed feature works, which is also pretty cool. You can embed URLs right here, or you can also embed HTML. If you use Airtable, or Typeform, Spotify, Miro, Google Maps, any of those work right here, you just have to pull the HTML and each platform shows you how to do that. But in this instance, we are going to just look at Google Docs. I'm going to say, Create, and it takes a second here, but you can see that it literally pulls in that Google Doc for you.\
\
[00:18:21.550] - Steph Blake\
I'm typing right now. You can see that it pulls it in right there. So if I type in here, I'm typing again, you can see it pulls it into both places. So if, for example, you wanted to send this out to another team member to review or you wanted to look at it in Google Docs, whatever the reason, or if you just prefer Google Docs, you can quickly embed it in here so that you're keeping everything in one place. So that is one of my all time favorite features of ClickUp. You also have the conversation tool. So this is similar to Slack. They actually created this to be a replacement to Slack, I think. I'm almost 99 % sure. So you would just start a conversation with somebody in here. So you would just hit @ and then their name, and it would pop up right here just like it does in Slack if you've used that before. And you could send it. I don't even know if it'll... Yeah, it will let me send. And then you can just have a conversation going right in here, too. The final feature that you can use are forms.\
\
[00:19:42.060] - Steph Blake\
So these are really cool, too, because this gets rid of the need for Google Forms or Airtable Forms or really any other form. You would just drag these in here for whichever items you wanted. You also have the ability to create custom fields. You have all of these options that you can choose from. We can say, What is your name? We can add that in there. So when we view it, you can see it has the items that we added in there. So you can pull the premade task fields that you already had, or you can add your own to make them completely custom. So very, very cool. Literally, so many ways to use this. And this is just one of the reasons why I'm so obsessed with it because of the flexibility. And I'm also somebody that loves to have everything in one place. So this makes it really, really easy to do that. Another one of my favorite feature. I just have so many favorite features. It's really hard to say what I love the most. But a really cool one is Inbox. So this is what it sounds like. This is your inbox.\
\
[00:21:00.020] - Steph Blake\
This shows you everything that is assigned to you that you have to do. So this is what I have assigned to myself to complete today. And you could see when you hover over, it tells you that it starts today for this blog post project. If I say that I am done with it, if I hover over the status bar right there and I say complete, it will get rid of it. We're going to ignore that. But say I wasn't able to get to this and I want to change to tomorrow, for example, I will close that out. And then if I hit next... Well, you can see other items that I have to work on for my business, I wasn't meaning to show that, but it looks like it pulled it in there. So you can see that it shows you other items that you have assigned to do. And then once items are done, they will all move to that section right there. You can also see items that you've delegated to other people. So if you are wondering if somebody was working on a project, you can do that. If you have unscheduled items, you can find all of those right here, and then you can assign due dates to those.\
\
[00:22:16.820] - Steph Blake\
And you have to keep in mind that the only time that something will be added to your inbox is when it is assigned to you. So even if you are a solopreneur and you don't have any team members in your business, you want to make sure that you are assigning all of those tasks to yourself. So let's walk through how to do that really quickly. So once you are in a folder, you'll see that you have your different lists, and within those, you have your tasks. Right here, it says the Assignee. So you can click on that and then assign it to yourself. It should automatically assign it to you, but you also have the capability to turn that off. So if you have a team, I prefer to or I suggest turning it off just because you will be assigning multiple tasks to different people. And if you are assigning it to yourself every time, that's just an extra time that you have to click it to turn it off and then assign another person to do it. So it just saves you one step. Another cool thing are favorites. So I really love favorites because it gives you an easy way to quickly access your most popular items or things that you need to be doing.\
\
[00:23:32.470] - Steph Blake\
So the way that you create your favorites in the bar over here is you click the ellipses on the view that you want. So we're just going to use the list view as an example. We're going to click the ellipses right there and we're going to say add to favorites. Click save and you could see it is on our favorites. But maybe we want the board view in there, too. So we're going to say add to favorites, and we'll call this board. So you can see that we have the list view and then we have the board view in there, too. And you can do this with anything that's in your space. So any view that you want, you just have to make sure that you assign it from the actual view up here by clicking that ellipses. One other thing that I wanted to quickly mention was this little button down here. So once you hover over it, it brings up this menu so you can create a new task from there, and it will just ask you which list you want to put it into. So we'll say January. This is an example.\
\
[00:24:48.990] - Steph Blake\
This is the description. This is where your task name goes. So we'll say 1:20 blog post. And you say, Create task. And we can see there it is. And it automatically defaults to the to-do section right here, and then you can move it to the different status that you want. Alternatively, you can... Actually, never mind. Forget that. What I was going to say is that you can choose the status from here, but I believe they don't have that feature yet. But what you can do is you can add different subtasks to it if you want to, or also add checklist, which is really cool. There's also the reminder function. So if you don't need an actual task, but maybe you need a reminder to, I don't know, take the garbage out, whatever it is, you can put that in there so that it will take garbage out. And it's assigned to me. So when I hit Save, you will see that it pops up in my inbox. So you can also create the reminders up here, garbage out again. So you can create the reminders right there or from this little area down here. The third item on here is your notepad.\
\
[00:26:17.250] - Steph Blake\
So you can create different notes. And then within there, it's literally just a virtual notepad. So you can just write whatever you want. Oh, test. Well, this is a test note. So once you go back, you could see it's right there. So if you had a really brilliant idea and you wanted to write it down before you forgot, you can easily and quickly do that right there. But now I just want to walk through just some best practices in terms of using ClickUp as a blogger. So I'm going to get rid of that example that I created. So when it comes to content creation, I think that the easiest... Well, I know that the easiest way, at least for me, is to create a folder with the month. And this just helps to keep things separated and easy for you to digest, because if you have too many things going on at once, then you're just going to get overwhelmed, honestly. And then within those folders, you have the different lists for the sections.\
\
[00:27:28.890] - Steph Blake\
Of.\
\
[00:27:29.810] - Steph Blake\
Your blog, the different topics that you talk about, however you refer to it. And then within those, you have your tasks. So our example right here is affiliates. So within the task right here, the name of the task is the date that it will go live. And then we have the name of the post next to it. So we can say ClickUp Review. Let's just say that. And then in the description, you can put whatever you want. So if you want to keep track of all of your keywords in here, if you want to link to that Google Doc, you can do that as well. I had to take a drink of water real fast. If you want to link to sites that you're going to backlink to, you can include those there as well. Whatever information is helpful to you and that you typically use when you're creating your post. Another thing that you can do is you can create different subtasks. So if you have tasks that you want to assign to yourself to get this done, we'll just say, write copy, whatever all of the tasks are. I would suggest creating a template, which I did right here.\
\
[00:28:51.630] - Steph Blake\
So I create a template and it includes everything in there. So then you can just easily duplicate that every single time. We have that, we have that. We have write, copy, research, post to blog, design, graphics for social media, whatever all of those tasks are, put all of those in as subtasks first, and then you will just duplicate that every time. So you can duplicate that by you have your template, click your ellipses, and then you say duplicate. I like to duplicate everything just to be safe. You would just call it the name. Just change that to the name. You will duplicate it, and then you can see it is right here. So then you can move it to whichever spot that you want. So it's in development, outline completed. Just continue moving these wherever they are in the process. And that's why I like to use the board view because it's just so easy to drag and drop, honestly. And it's easier to see and just conceptualize for me personally in the board view than it is in the list view. I don't know. But maybe you prefer the list view, which is great.\
\
[00:30:14.260] - Steph Blake\
Just do whatever works for you and what makes sense to you. Another way that you can use it for blogging is to keep track of affiliates. So I would suggest creating a list. Maybe you name this, StockPhotosites, and you create different categories based on your affiliates. You have one for software, StockPhotosites software. Then within those, you would put the name of the stock photo site here. Then within there, you can put the affiliate URL. If somebody asks you for it or you're including it in a post, you can just quickly come down here, grab the link, and embed it in. One other thing, I know we quickly talked about this, but say, for example, you have your post here and you want to assign something to a team member. What you can do, once you're in the subtask, their name would pop up right here. So after you add them to the space, you would just select them right there, and then their face would pop up right here. So like I said, that is just the tip of the iceberg. When it comes to talking about ClickUp, there are so many ways that you can use it, so many different ways that you can customize it for your business.\

So throughout this training, we have talked about the importance of using a digital project management tool in your business and how that pretty printed planner just isn't cutting it, why automations are so important for creating scalability both for your clients and your business. Because let's be real, you can only do so much and you only have so much time in the day. So the more that you can automate and get your time back, the more that you can scale your business and grow.

Hi, and welcome to the E-Mail Escape Plan, a minimalist approach to handling email chaos. A big thanks to Liz Stapleton for hosting this Bloggers Breakthrough Summit. I'm very excited to be returning speaker and to present to you how I get out of the email dark hole. So I have a question for you. Is your email a never-ending source of chaos? It doesn't matter how many times you try to create a system to be super organized. Do you always just feel like it ends up failing and you continually get tons and tons of emails that you need to sort through and have no idea how to do that? Here's the thing. You don't need to spend hours sorting emails to stay on top of things. My method is super simple, straightforward, and best of all, it works. Today, I'm going to show you how I escape overwhelm every day without using traditional methods like labels and categories. If you are ready to ditch the inbox chaos and regain control, I am so excited for us to dive in. But first, I just wanted to introduce myself. My name is Yazzi from The High Vibe Biz, and I am a tech and automation specialist.\
\
[00:01:32.020] - Yazzi Huerta\
Some fun facts about me is that I am Mexican-American with dual citizenship, and I almost had triple citizenship because I was very close to getting my Australian citizenship, but we decided not to. I'm a nomad, and I spend most of my time throughout the year in Los Angeles, New York, and my favorite is our property in Mexico on the West Coast. I'm obsessed with helping entrepreneurs simplify and automate their businesses, their processes, and their funnels. I'm a former I'm a digital media director, so I used to work with many big brands like Honda North America, Mazda Australia, Dial Soap. And I've worked with a lot of smaller brands too, like Trevor Wine Estates, Wire Tourism, Calgary Golf, all over the spectrum. But one thing I find interesting is that it doesn't matter if you are a big wig working at a big company like that or if you're an entrepreneur like yourself. Email chaos is a real thing. And I cannot wait to show you how to save time with the email so that you have more time to do what you love. So my goal here today is to teach you how to save time and save mental clutter so that you can make a bigger impact, not only in your own personal life with your family's lives, but your local community and any social causes that you believe in that we really need out there.\
\
[00:02:47.640] - Yazzi Huerta\
Okay, this inbox is beautiful. I wish that my inbox could look like this. And this is just a random screenshot that I got on the internet, and it's beautiful. If I could maintain my inbox so that it was color-coded and perfectly labeled and just is beautiful to look at, I would be so happy. But the truth is that the methods to maintain an inbox like this is completely unsustainable. There are way too many labels that you can see here on the left-hand side. There's a little arrows next to these labels, which means that there's subnested labels as well. In order to do all this, you have to be on top of your email. You have to know all the ins and outs, and you have to spend time doing this. And I just couldn't do it. I believe that your email needs to be a source of ease. It shouldn't take you more time to organize your email than it does to actually read and take action on them. Because if you do spend a lot of that time doing this organization, I feel like you're going to hate your inbox. Because here's the thing about email, there's always going to be another one.\
\
[00:03:54.310] - Yazzi Huerta\
And one day you might be too tired and you don't do your organization, and And a few emails turn into 25 emails. And then soon enough, there's 100 emails in your inbox that you now have to organize and put labels on and everything. And then find the thousandth email, you're like, Okay, I'm done. I am no longer organizing this. I give up. And it's just too manageable. So a while back, I was listening to some NPR podcast. It was probably this American Life or Invisibelia, and it's literally years and years ago. But this podcast was It was all about how to get results faster. It was more unconventional because it wasn't about how to add things to ensure that things get done faster. It was about how you can remove something from a process and then get to your result faster. So one day when I was in this hole of adding labels to my inbox and organizing, categorizing them and everything, I decided excited that I wasn't going to listen to the gurus and all the classes I took about organizing your emails. I was going to start taking away. I realized I didn't need labels.\
\
[00:05:14.730] - Yazzi Huerta\
I didn't need subnested labels. I didn't need multiple inbox, which going back here, where it says unread, all zero action items, all waiting on everything else. Those are multiple inbox in your inbox. And I didn't need categories Categories. Categories are when my Google predefined what your email is. So is it a promo email? Is it something like, I didn't need all of that. So step one is to simplify your inbox. Trust me, I have tried all of the views. Gmail's default view with the different categories on top, multiple inboxes like I just showed you. But these tactics just didn't work because it was more work for me. I needed to simplify, and I'm sure you do, too. So here is what my inbox looks like now. It is plain and simple and legit. I think I have, since I started this presentation, I think I have four emails in my inbox right now, but most of the time it looks like this. If not, there's less than 10 emails in there, and I'll explain why. I do have two labels, and I'll explain why I have two labels now, but it is super simple to go through.\
\
[00:06:21.940] - Yazzi Huerta\
How I got here was first I went into my Gmail settings and I removed categories from my inbox. I was losing track of emails because Google kept auto-organizing things to social updates, forms, and promotions. The truth is that their tools to organize this information, I never found that it was accurate. I decided, You know what, Google, enough is enough. I get to decide what is an important email and what isn't an important email. I've unchecked promotions, unchecked social, unchecked updates and forums, and I only have one Inbox Now, which is primary. So these little tabs that you would see on top, gone. I also removed Enable reading pane because it just doesn't work for me, but you can add that if that works for you. It's not a big deal. But the whole point was to remove category stories from my inbox, and I stopped missing important emails because I no longer let Google decide what was important and what wasn't. Next, I went back into settings and then went into the labels tab, and I decided what I wanted to see in my menu. So you go back to the screenshot, here on the left-hand side, this is your menu, and you can decide what you get to see and what you don't want to see.\
\
[00:07:41.520] - Yazzi Huerta\
The first thing that I did was I hit all of the categories here. You can see that they're bold and black because that means that's the setting that it's currently on. Since I didn't like the way Google categorized my emails anyways, completely off. Next, I made sure that some labels were always seeing. So this included my sent folder, all mail folder, and trash. And lastly, I only wanted to see emails if there were unread emails in my schedule, my drafts, and my spam. And here's why. Because if there's no emails in them, then I don't need to see them. Easy, easy. But if there are emails in them, I do want to see them. Why would I want to keep this on for spam? I can't tell you how many times an email that I needed that was important and it up in spam. When I see that there's an email in spam, I can easily look at it and then decide if this is an important email or if it actually needs to be deleted. If it needs to be deleted, it's so fast to just select them and delete and then get them out of your mental clutter space.\
\
[00:08:46.600] - Yazzi Huerta\
They're just completely gone. Next, I turned off conversation view. If you go into settings in general in Gmail and you scroll down, you're going to see this on top, conversation view. So this groups your emails on the same topic. So eventually, if they have the same subject line, they're going to be grouped together. This was such a problem for me because every new email would remove the old email because it was all grouped into one. And it made it impossible for me to find my to-dos within the listed email. So as soon as I turned that off, that means every single email is its own email, I became so much more efficient and able to tackle my to-do So I turned those off, and I just feel like it's a way better clear view. And don't worry, you still have your thread inside the email, so you can look at things really quickly if you needed to. Step two. I love love. I would write a love song to keyboard shortcuts. You don't have to become this shortcut wizard or anything, but you just need to learn a few to zip through your email. And once you learn my favorites, you're just going to be amazed.\
\
[00:09:59.370] - Yazzi Huerta\
But before When you learn them, you need to do this first. Turn on the shortcuts. So go back to settings, go to general, and then scroll down to keyboard shortcuts and make sure to turn this on. And then once you've made all of your changes, click Save so that all of your changes have saved in your settings. Once you turn on your shortcuts, take a screenshot of my favorite shortcuts. So the top three that I recommend for you are E for archiving, S to star an email, and shift A to reply all in a new window. Those are the top three. I actually use all of these every single day, but those are the top three that I use consistently over and over and over again. And I would be a blob without them. I'll explain more why, e, for archiving. But G plus A, so g, a at the same time on your keyboard, it takes you to all of your email. J, once you're in your email and you're looking for things, but you want to go to the next unread email or the next email, just click J, and it will take you to the older conversations.\
\
[00:11:05.160] - Yazzi Huerta\
K takes it to the newer conversation. S to star an email, and then shift A to reply all in a new window. Sometimes I use S to star an email because it's really important and I never, ever want to forget it. And then shift A because I hate when I reply to an email and then it takes me all the way to the bottom of the email, and I can't even see what the person wrote to me to actually respond to the email. Having my reply pop up in a new window, game changer, much more efficient and effective. Love it. So now that you know how to archive an email using keyboard shortcuts, I want you to embrace the power of archiving. So I don't know if you've been sleeping on this, but archiving is amazing. Back in the day, when we used to send emails to each other, we had a limit on file size. Because we no longer send ginormous attachments to each other anymore, email has gotten so much better in terms of how it sends. It doesn't take a lot of file size. We can keep as many emails that we possibly want, and I absolutely do.\
\
[00:12:12.080] - Yazzi Huerta\
I just keep every single email that is sent to me. The only ones that I delete are spam emails. And now that I know this, I am confident that I will never, ever do something that is important, something that I worked with a client, we worked with somebody I've contracted with, I've hired with. And I will never, ever do something, an invoice, whatever else, because I'm just archiving, I'm not deleting anything. And once you know that you will never delete anything that is important, that mental clutter and stress just is completely removed. So I don't have to label anything, categorize them. It's just, Oh, it saved. It saved in my Gmail, and I don't have to worry about it. So stop labeling and embrace archiving. Now, I know what you're thinking. You're like, Okay, I'm archiving, but how do I actually find these emails that I need when I need them? You're going to become a pro at Gmail Search, and I bet you are already a pro at Gmail Search. They make it super easy for you to find your emails using their filtering system, which I love every day. But trust me, if you really need an email, you will find it, and it will be simple to find.\
\
[00:13:26.410] - Yazzi Huerta\
The ones from your students, your coaches, the things that you care you will find those emails. So the only time I haven't been able to find an email is because the email didn't exist forever. I just made it up. I would confuse it with something else, like a Facebook Messenger or somewhere. And second, it was because it was in a separate email inbox, because you have multiple businesses. I also have my personal email account with health stuff and whatever else. I just got confused. But I promise you, even if you couldn't find an email using this method, I doubt you'd be able to find the email using a super organized and labeled system because you would have to be super organized and spend all that time every single day organizing your system in order to find it. I just feel like that's such a huge timeline. It's like 15 to 30 minutes every day, labeling, organizing versus spending five minutes once every month or a few times a month to find an email. Step five, filter emails you don't need to see. This is a huge one. I have a project manager. I send all my emails that I are specific to-dos to ClickUp.\
\
[00:14:33.610] - Yazzi Huerta\
And once that email arrives in my inbox in Gmail, it is auto-archived. And I do this by using filters. A couple of examples. Squarespace sends me emails when I get a comment on my blog. So I don't want to see it in my inbox. I want to see it in ClickUp. So it automatically sends the ClickUp, and then it auto-archives in my inbox. The same with emails from Tidio. So Tidio is like [inaudible 00:14:58]. It's a messenger you put on your website and allows people to message you. So all those emails that I don't need to see that are actually to do is automatically get sent to ClickUp. Other emails, there are some that I just can't unsubscribe from because if I unsubscribe from those emails and I unsubscribed from other important emails from that tool or that creator. So instead, I create a filter that says unsubscribed emails from this specific person that says X, Y, and Z, either in the subject line or in the body of the the email. An example of this is Thrivecart sends me an email anytime if anyone has signed up to my affiliate program. But the thing is, I have a system that allows me to vet my affiliates.\
\
[00:15:42.710] - Yazzi Huerta\
So I approve them even before I get that email from Thrivecart. So it's a waste of space. I just don't need to see it, and I don't want to spend my time archiving it, even though it takes just a second. And just that second of freeness is super valuable for me. And so I automatically send those to Archive immediately, and I just create a filter to do that. All right, step six. Once you have your inbox looking fresh and clean and you set up your filters, it's time to take action on what's important. The first thing you need to remember is that you are the only one who knows what's important for you to see. You get to decide. You are the controller of your inbox. And I want you to be proud of that because you don't have to see anything you don't want to see. You don't have to reply to anything you don't want to reply to. Obviously, things that are important for your business you need to. So if you have a project manager tool, make sure that you send those emails to your project manager tool. Check if your tools have an extension so that you can easily add those emails that you need to take action on to your to-do list in your tool.\
\
[00:16:52.820] - Yazzi Huerta\
But be super clear on your boundaries. Not every email needs to be on your to-do list. So yes, sometimes emails have to take action on, but it doesn't require you to actually take action on it. I have a simple rule that I've just set up that if it requires more than 5 to 10 minutes of brain power that I actually have to focus and sit and respond. And it just goes to my project manager tool. I'll add it. But if I know I'm going to respond within that day, even though it takes 5 to 10 minutes, it just stays in my inbox and I'll respond directly and it's just done. It's not an actual to-do list that's going to take more than 10 minutes. So therefore it doesn't go into my ClickUp. So I just leave it in my inbox, and when I have time, I deal with it. But then there's other emails that come in and they're, I will want to read that email from such and such creator, but I just don't have time right now. And so I'll let it sit in my inbox for a few days. And if I get to it, I get to it.\
\
[00:17:47.720] - Yazzi Huerta\
But if I don't, and I'm really busy, I just let it go. I just decide to archive it. And if I have a chance, I will read it later. Because using the Google's Gmail search function I can find it again and it's not that big of a deal. You just have to be ruthless, and not even ruthless, but just be kind to yourself and realize that it's okay to not read every email and to let things go sometimes that are not going to impact your business negatively. All right. By this point, your inbox is streamlined, your labels and categories are minimized, and you're mastering shortcuts. But let's talk about the second to last step. Automation. There are emails that you will want quick access to or to write notes about or to categorize without cluttering up your inbox or creating additional labels. So I want to introduce Bookmark Magic. Bookmark Magic is a Chrome extension that I created, and it's like this personal assistant for saving and organizing important links, even emails, from your browser to a Google Sheet. And with one click, you can categorize to go exactly where you want it to go, whether it's your project management tool, like if your project management tool doesn't already have an extension that you can do this with, or you just want to send it to a Google Sheet so that you can write notes or remember things for later, or maybe you want to send an email to all of your Slack team.\
\
[00:19:16.680] - Yazzi Huerta\
Maybe you got an amazing testimonial from a student or a client, and you just wanted to share with everybody really quickly. Bookmark Magic allows you to do this without all of the stress, and it will save everything to where and if you want it to be saved. I feel like you'll never lose a link again. And it also gives you an opportunity to provide contacts to important emails or important links on the web. So when I use it through email, sometimes I get really good emails from creators, just great, fantastic emails. And I want to take it for later, but I don't want to put it into a folder in my Gmail because I actually want to write notes about it and why it was inspiring, what was just different about it. And so I use Bookmark Magic to write a few notes, and I saved the link, and I'm able to go back and see those emails in one place without any issue.\
\
[00:20:04.660] - Yazzi Huerta\
This way your productivity doesn't stall and you have everything right where you need it.\
\
[00:20:09.520] - Yazzi Huerta\
Step eight, make it yours.\
\
[00:20:13.720] - Yazzi Huerta\
So once you've worked with the system, you have to make it yours. Adjust the system so it fits your needs and your business's needs. I personally added two additional labels, one for courses and another for people who respond to my broadcast emails from Kit.com. I've then further customized these to automate information I need. When I add a course label to an email with course details, the email is sent to a ChatGPT assistant to pull out core data like creator name, course name, and logging URL. And that all gets added to ClickUp. Another way I use it is that if someone responds to my broadcast emails, I respond and add a label to the email that I send. This email triggers an automation within make. Com that will update the subscribers custom field engagement point. So essentially, it's this whole system that created. And this makes it easy for me to track who has actually engaged with my emails and who has it, which makes cleaning out my email list super easy. Other things that you should definitely do, too, is unsubscribe from any email list that you don't want to be involved with anymore.\
\
[00:21:19.150] - Yazzi Huerta\
That's the basics, but it's super, super helpful to keep on top of your email list.\
\
[00:21:24.770] - Yazzi Huerta\
I've learned that now that I'm using my one inbox method, I see every single email that comes through, and it's so much easier for me to discern which emails I just no longer need and can unsubscribe from. If you need a helpful tip on how to unsubscribe from emails as quickly as possible, use the search function to search for unsubscribed, and all of the emails that have an unsubscribed link will show up. You can just go through every single one using shortcuts to go through each individual email and then pricking the unsubscribed button. Just don't forget to review the new popup window that appears to unsubscribe, because that way you can confirm that you unsubscribed from that email list. I know so many people on my email list for my B2C business, they don't realize that there's an additional step. So just something to keep in mind if you didn't know that either. Another useful tip is to use the snooze button on emails. So maybe you need to take action on something, but you don't want to see it in your inbox. Maybe you want to see it at a later date in a couple of weeks, in a month, whatever.\
\
[00:22:37.770] - Yazzi Huerta\
You can go ahead and click on the snooze button on the right-hand side of an email within Gmail and it will ask you, how long do you want to snooze it for? When it's time, it will reappear in your inbox so that you can take action. I think for those of you who maybe don't use a project management tool, you're super on top of your things without a project manager tool, I think that's a super helpful way for you to continue to take action without cluttering your mind or your visual inbox.\
\
[00:23:12.150] - Yazzi Huerta\
All right, so let's just take a quick moment to recap. We've journeyed through a few steps to escape your email chaos from simplifying your inbox to automations your workflows with the Bookmark Magic. This isn't just about a cleaner inbox. This is about a shift towards simplicity, saving mental energy, and finding ease in your day-to-day. I want challenge you. Start today.
