All right, guys. I'm really excited for our next speaker. He is a personal finance nerd, an online entrepreneur. He and his wife were buried in student loan debt, which led them to start their personal finance blog. And three years later, or within three years, I should say, they were making multiple six figures. They've both been able to quit their jobs to work on the blog full time. They have a huge passion for helping people with money. And I'm really excited to welcome from 'The Savvy Couple', Kelan Kline. Kelan, thank you so much for being part of the summit!

[00:00:40.610] - Kelan Kline
Hey, Liz. Thanks for having us. We're so excited to be a part of it this year. 

[00:00:46.010] - Elizabeth Stapleton
Yes. So we're going to be talking about sponsored content, sponsored post, sponsorships with blogs. And you mentioned actually that the first money you ever made was through sponsors. Do you want to share a little bit about that?

[00:00:57.470] - Kelan Kline
Yeah. After college, I kinda jumped around from job to job. We started our blog as kind of a side hustle to help pay off student loan debt. I was just done working for other people. And nine months into blogging, everyone that started blogging knows that first six months is just insane. The learning curve is crazy, and it's just a grind. And finally in the 9th month, we had an email come in and it said, "Hey, we want to sponsor a post on your blog. We're willing to pay you $50." And we were really small at that time. And just like a light bulb went off and we were so excited. We celebrated. And then two weeks later, I went to Brittany. And this was after we saved up a ton of money and got stable financially. And I said, "Hey, I'd like to quit my job and do this full time." She blessed me to do that. And the rest is history now.

[00:01:41.810] - Elizabeth Stapleton
Awesome! So, in that instance, someone had reached out to you directly. But that's not always how sponsorship opportunities come about. So obviously, that kinda whetted your appetite. How do you find sponsorships now? How did you when you were still new find those opportunities? Did you pitch directly? Was there a resource?

[00:02:02.150] - Kelan Kline
Yeah. Good question. I think it's important to know your numbers and know your blog, know your online business. So get those demographics, understand what your pageviews are, put together a nice media kit. That's the first thing that we did. We just made ourselves accessible on our site. We always have an "Advertise with us" page, so if there are brands coming to look to sponsor personal finance blog, we're super easy to access and get a hold of, where a lot of companies fail to do that. That's number one. And that's a good way to get a lot of inbound sponsorships. Then the outbound ones. We kind of take the approach...We're pretty analytical and really good with numbers. I put together an Excel sheet. I'm kind of an Excel nerd. And I have a list of 100 dream companies I would like to work with and it's all filtered by how much they align with our business, how easy they would be to partner with. Like, how big of a company are they. And we just go down the line every month and I reach out to a few. I make it a habit. I always put that time and effort into reaching out to sponsors and getting them interested in getting them to eventually work with us. It is a lot of outreach and a lot of work to do the outreach to get those sponsorship deals, for sure.

[00:03:11.550] - Elizabeth Stapleton
Sure. But you're using really an inbound or direct outreach. You're not using a website or something.

[00:03:18.330] - Kelan Kline
Yeah. There are a bunch of sponsored networks that you can use and sign up, and you link your analytics up to and stuff. We've never really found that much luck with them. We've been able to do a couple of social media campaigns, where it's a one-off Tweet or a one-off Facebook post where you get paid $50 to $100. But we're really focused on the big sponsorships that are going to move the needle in our business and give us a big thing of cash flow to reinvest.

[00:03:41.190] - Elizabeth Stapleton
Okay. So you mentioned media kit and the direct outreach. So what all besides your analytics, what all are you including in your media kit? What are you including in your pitches?

[00:03:53.190] - Kelan Kline
Media kit shares exactly what The Savvy Couple is about. So our mission, our demographics are very close to who our demographic is, which is millennial moms a certain, at 25 to 35 years old. So, just really understanding our business. Because the whole point of getting a company to work with you is they need help marketing, and they want to get in front of an audience that already has someone that's built trust with them and has that authority. So, they're willing to pay you to get in front of your audience that's their ideal customers. And just knowing your business inside out, it's really important.

[00:04:24.930] - Elizabeth Stapleton
Okay. So when you pitch, you're obviously including your media kit, but do you do a lengthy email? Is it like a short, "Hey, we'd really love to work with you. We think we really align. Here's our media kit"? How in-depth are you getting? How generalized are those pitches?

[00:04:44.050] - Kelan Kline
They're very optimized. I know that anyone that we're reaching out to, they have a busy schedule. And everyone's email box is just littered with emails. So it's very quick like, "Hey, my name is Kelan Kline. I'm a personal finance expert that runs The Savvy Couple." And then the next line is, "We're very interested in starting a long-term partnership." So, there are a lot of key terms that you need to use when reaching out to brands and working with them. And the ones that always triggers excitement in them is saying "Long-term partnership," because they don't want a one-off just like you don't. You want to be able to partner with the brand and partner with them year after year. So long term partnership, kind of explained how we align. So if it's a company that's helping increase income, that's exactly what we like to do, too. So we just pair our two missions into one so that we have that alignment. We give a quick thing of stats and bullet points. And at the bottom, we put who we've been featured on or partnered with before. And then the very end is, "Here's our media kit and About Us page so you can learn more." But, yeah. It very strategically, kind of, captivates them, gets them interested, shares exactly what they need to know. And it has had a really good success rate. 

[00:05:53.830] - Elizabeth Stapleton
Awesome. It sounds like it gives them the information they need to want to learn more. Like it's not a waste of their time to keep going. So with the long term partnership, it's not probably just like a post here and there. What do those partnerships look like? How do you determine that? I know it varies by the company you're working with.

[00:06:16.510] - Kelan Kline
Yeah, that's a great question. So a lot of bloggers and us ourselves, when we are learning this process with sponsorships, they respond to our outreach email, and they'd say, "What does your budget look like?" Or "What is your fees for a sponsored campaign?" And we tell them, "It would be like, $500, $1,000." And they just kept answering like, "Sure, let's do it". Like, just way too easily. And being someone that's an entrepreneur and understands negotiation, I'm like something's up. We're worth more than what we're asking for because they wouldn't be saying yes every time. So then we came up with a strategy like, let's try to get them to tell us what their budget is before we say anything on what we're gonna, kinda the deliverables we're going to give them. So that's a key. And that's one of the big secrets in our strategy is, asking the company what their budget is. And there's a lot of strategy around that and how to word it correctly. But once you get that, the ball is in their court. So they're going to say, "Hey, we have $1,000", "We have $2,500, we have $5000, $10,000 budget. What can you do for us?" And at that point, I take that budget and I look across all of our marketing channels, our email list. We can do multiple blog posts. We've done YouTube videos, we've done social media amplification, we've done Facebook ads. So we put this whole marketing package together for this brand that just gave us what their budget is, and we pitch it to them, and send it in a nice wrap up proposal that they're very interested in. If they've given you a budget. They're interested in working with you. So chances are, if you can send them the right deliverables that they're looking for, you can land that sponsorship.

[00:07:51.190] - Elizabeth Stapleton
Okay, so, a couple of follow-up questions to that. What are you doing, sort of how are you deciding, okay, I've got this budget. What is that worth in terms of the deliverables I'm going to create? Because I feel like some people, especially if you're a newer blogger, if someone tells you I've got $1,000 budget, you're like, "I've got to do everything!" So how do you determine that?

[00:08:13.870] - Kelan Kline
It's definitely kinda part of the experience that we've had doing this for so many years now. But, yeah. I think in the beginning, you cut yourself short and say, like you said, I got to do everything. I got to send ten emails for this company and really deliver on them. And a lot of the times these partnerships are one-offs, and you want to do your best and you're going to do your best. But there's a lot of times that you're not gonna meet what they want, and that's okay. The important thing is to kind of, make sure that whatever their budget is, you're only putting in as much time and effort that you're willing to. So, know what your hourly rate is. If you're only willing to work $20 an hour, $25 an hour or you really want to make $50 an hour, you got to calculate how long it's going to take you to put all these assets together for them to run that campaign.

[00:09:02.170] - Elizabeth Stapleton
Okay. And then you say you put together a really nice proposal. What are you using to create that proposal?

[00:09:07.630] - Kelan Kline
Just Google Doc, and then I save it as a PDF. It's just a template and a form that we use. It's got our logo top. It kinda explains exactly what the campaign is all about, like an overview, then the deliverables and then the fees. Another thing that I forgot to mention is when you are figuring out what their budget is, another thing that you really want to do is become a good listener and really make it all about them when you're reaching out to this brand and they're starting to interact with you and get that interest. And figure out what their problems are in their marketing and how you can align and make sure you can solve those for them. So if they're looking for just brand awareness, that's a lot easier to do on social media than conversions, where you're going to have to run an email campaign that you can get conversions up. Or you can do call to actions on your blog or write SEO post. But it's important to understand what their problem is and then be that person that can solve it. Just like any business.

[00:09:59.530] - Elizabeth Stapleton
Yeah. That's a great point. So then, I know you're using their budget to align with the pricing. What happens when it's lower than you expect it to be? Are you just pitching a smaller deliverable? Or are you like, we're going to pass? How do you make that decision?

[00:10:21.710] - Kelan Kline
Yeah. Great question. Obviously, as a newer blogger, you're going to accept everything because you're making money and it's important to get that win. And that's how we used to be. Now we're very particular. We pass on a lot of brands that offer us a lot of money. It's really making sure that we keep that trust with your audience. And I can't explain how important it is to not just sell yourself out and take any sponsor that comes your way. Make sure it aligns and actually helps your audience. But yeah, if they don't have a budget that aligns with us. And ours now, since we have grown our SEO traffic and grown our brand, we have a pretty big email list. We don't accept anything under $2,500, which seems like a ton. And that's just for a sponsored post, so one article. So again, it's going back to how much time is it going to take you if it aligns with your brand. And then if it's lower than you think, you can literally send an email back and say, "Hey, this budget is a lot lower than we normally work with. We usually work at this price. Is there any way you can meet us halfway?" Or "With your budget, we can only really do X amount of stuff for you unfortunately." And a lot of times you'll turn them down, and then six months later, when you've grown your blog for six months, you can come back and circle back around. And that's something I always like to do and say, "Hey, this is what our stats are now. We'd like to partner again. Do you guys have a bigger budget type of thing?" Just keep that line of communication open. 

[00:11:41.090] - Elizabeth Stapleton
Okay. I think it goes back towards the long-term continued communication. So when you've done a sponsored post, you've done a campaign with a brand and you want to keep that long-term relationship going to work with them again, what are you sending them afterwards that kind of shows the result? How are you showing the results of your work to make it easier to pitch later?

[00:12:12.390] - Kelan Kline
Yeah. So, you definitely want to send them the article or the YouTube video, whatever the link is or the main deliverable. And send them any social media links that you've sent out. Facebook ads have worked really well for us. That's definitely an advanced marketing technique. But you're able to target an audience and send traffic to an offer. You can make a ton of conversions and people love to see that, as companies. So, I send them screenshots of our Facebook ads. Just keep them updated through the entire process. Say, "Hey, our team's working on the post right now. We're going to send it next week for you to review." Just make them a part of the process. And if it doesn't go as well, you can share why, your feelings on why you didn't think it went as well. But yeah. Just keep in touch over the time. On our Excel sheet too, we like to keep track of the name and the email that we've used, last time we connected with them, and just build that real relationship. Because one of our biggest sponsors we ever had, they asked for our physical address, and they sent us Christmas presents and a Christmas wreath. It was awesome. We obviously built a real relationship with that person we were working with. So, that's huge.

[00:13:21.210] - Elizabeth Stapleton
Yeah. I think a lot of times people forget whether you're an online business or not, that behind every business are people. You know.

[00:13:32.490] - Kelan Kline
Exactly.

[00:13:32.540] - Elizabeth Stapleton
So you're sending them the information, the stats, the results. So, I want to follow up because you mentioned you run ads and ads costs money. So, how are you kind of, how much of maybe the income you're taking from the sponsored post is potentially going towards ads?

[00:13:48.750] - Kelan Kline
Yeah. Good question. So in our proposals, we usually pitch like a $250 campaign, $500 campaign. We've done $1,000 campaign. And every time we do that, we have the company pay for the ads, and they also pay a little fee for my time to put them together. So if we're running $500 campaign, I usually charge $1,000. $500 of my time plus $500 for the ad campaign. And that's good for them, because whether it works out or not, they get data on marketing from an influencer on how they would market their brand and just really invaluable information. And a lot of times, we've had campaigns that have worked incredibly. And we're all making money. So, we just continue them to run until they run dry.

[00:14:31.650] - Elizabeth Stapleton
Okay. So, you're saying we're all making money. Obviously, you make money from the sponsored post. Are you also then an affiliate for the company and you're making affiliate commissions as well? Is that usually...

[00:14:41.370] - Kelan Kline
Correct. I would say 75% of the time we're allowed to use our affiliate links within the sponsored post. So, yeah. We kind of negotiate so, we get a flat front up fee as well as affiliate commission.

[00:14:56.130] - Elizabeth Stapleton
Which again, that's that long term. Because the upfront fee is a one time but the commissions keep going.

[00:15:00.510] - Kelan Kline
Yes. Which is another point I want to make. A ton of bloggers, we all get these. I'm sure you get a ton of them, is affiliate emails. People reaching out to you and say, "Hey, we would love for you to join our affiliate. We're paying X amount of dollars. It's a perfect match... bla bla." Obviously, we delete a ton of those. But there are some that are like, Wow, this company wants affiliates. They might have a marketing budget. Let's kind of twist this and say, "Hey, we will join you to our brand. We'll start marketing you as a company that we love and enjoy. It's going to help our audience. But first, we want you to give us a flat fee to do a sponsored campaign with us, and then we'll join the affiliate program and promote you long term." So, a lot of times those are awesome outbound emails that you can send to kind of take those cold, outreach affiliate emails to you and turn back and make some awesome money from them. 

[00:15:49.410] - Elizabeth Stapleton
Yeah. And then you're making money that much faster because affiliate income can take a while. And even if you earn those commissions, they might not be paid out for months.

[00:15:58.170] - Kelan Kline
Right. 

[00:16:00.930] - Elizabeth Stapleton
Okay. So another thing I want to ask...And I'm not going to ask you to get into too many details because we have a session with a lawyer on this. I assume you're signing a contract. I really hope. What sort of terms are you including in there? I've heard horror stories of people being, like, "Two years later, the post no longer aligned with my brand. I took it down." And then they did a charge-back on PayPal. So, what kind of terms are you including in your sponsorship agreement?

[00:16:27.930] - Kelan Kline
Yeah. So, we use a sponsored agreement that we got from a lawyer as well. And it's super easy to fill out and reuse it over and over. But, yeah. You're making sure everyone is on the same page with what the deliverables are, the time frame on when they're due, how long they're going to last, the pricing that's going to get paid, the pricing structure...Are you going to get paid up front? In the middle? At the end? Multiple payments or one payment at once? Just all the very important information that you definitely want to get in a contract signed by everybody. You can use an email thread as your contract but it's definitely better...

[00:17:03.750] - Elizabeth Stapleton
Yeah, it's written. We have an entire session with an attorney talking about contracts for bloggers. So, I'm not going to ask you to say what qualifies as a contract. But just kind of knowing those terms because I think a lot of people don't think about, well, I may want to take this down someday. And some of those other things. What are some other mistakes or roadblocks that you've made or that you've heard of that obviously you've learned from, but what are some things you see happening a lot?

[00:17:31.590] - Kelan Kline
Yeah. This one happened this year, actually. We agreed verbally and writtenly in an email, and we put together two sponsored posts for them. We started to put the campaign together, and then all of a sudden it's like, "Hey, we're not going to do it anymore. We're backing out. We're not paying you." It was like, EH! That was the first time it has ever happened. So, we have a rule now that we get paid at least a deposit upfront. And mostly, I'd say 99% of the time, it's "Give us everything up front." Unless it's a massive campaign, then we'll do half up front, half at the end. So definitely a roadblock is making sure you get paid up, paid in advance and just talking your way into doing that just to protect yourself so that you do get payment up front and then you can do the deliverables. You don't get caught out to dry. 

[00:18:17.010] - Elizabeth Stapleton
Yeah. No one wants to chase invoices.

[00:18:19.050] - Kelan Kline
Exactly.

[00:18:21.330] - Elizabeth Stapleton
So what is the timelines of, oftentimes from, whether you guys outreach or they reach out, to deciding on the terms, to when everything gets published and sent out and the campaign runs and how long is the campaign? What does that timeline look like?

[00:18:36.450] - Kelan Kline
Yeah. So I'd say the cold outreach emails, it's sometimes hard to find people in the corporations and in the company. And all big companies work very slowly. So it's usually about a month to get to the right person, start talking. And then from there, the timeline really depends on, like one of the companies we were working with is H&R Block and tax season is on its way. So there's a deadline like, we want this content now at this point in the year, so that it's pitched at the right time, and it makes sense with H&R Block. So, there's a lot of stuff like that as far as timelines, and that's just how you go off things. But I'd say, from start to finish, you outreach email to the end of the campaign where you're done with your social media, you're done sending emails, probably two to three months, most likely. 

[00:19:31.210] - Elizabeth Stapleton
Okay. How many, and obviously, it's going to depend on various factors, but how many sponsorships are you doing on average a year? How many would you recommend a new blogger do, if they can get them?

[00:19:40.450] - Kelan Kline
Yeah. I think realistically, one a month is totally doable for just about anybody, no matter how small you are. Companies want to get in front of brands, and they know, well sometimes you have to teach them this. But there's value in partnering with smaller companies, because then two years from now, the blog is going to be much bigger and you're still going to be getting promoted by them. So I think one a month is definitely doable. We try to land at least one big one per month and then our best month, we probably did four. So in a total year, we're doing anywhere from 12 to 20 sponsorships. And a lot of them are with companies from before. So it's promoting the same companies that align with our brand and we work before. So it's just a win-win for everybody.

[00:20:27.070] - Elizabeth Stapleton
That sounds great. So, I know you said your very first money blogging was $50 sponsorship. How big do you think the site has to be before they start going off after those sponsorships? Because it's probably not as big as they think.

[00:20:39.010] - Kelan Kline
Yeah,no, that's an awesome question. I think it's important to be able to get traffic to your blog and understand what you're doing, understand how to create content that gets seen and write good titles. It's important to be able to market yourself before you market someone else. So, I don't know if there's an exact number. It's feeling confident in being able to market yourself and get the traffic. I feel like I started reaching out when we had 1000 page views a month, which starting out, that's huge. It takes a long time to get to that point. But then once you do, you can definitely start reaching out, especially if you have social media channels, followings in other places and email lists. You can just build those assets that you can pitch the brands. 

[00:21:21.370] - Elizabeth Stapleton
Yeah. And the more you do it, the more you're able to. I think when other brands see that you've worked with brands, even if they're not big-name brands, it shows that you know what you're doing. So, you got to start somewhere.

[00:21:31.330] - Kelan Kline
Yep. Absolutely. And I think that's a good point, that you want to start with smaller brands. You don't want to go after...If you're trying to work with Target, you don't want to go after Target if you're just brand new. Start with a brand that's much smaller and work your way up, build up your experience. And then when you have your stuff together and you have the experience, you know how to do communication, networking, and negotiating, then you can check those big partners.

[00:21:54.490] - Elizabeth Stapleton
So one thing I want to ask you is, because I also have experience to try to track down the right person in the organization, it can be rather difficult. What are, sort of, the titles of the people that you found are the right people to be reaching out to when you're looking for a contact?

[00:22:12.790] - Kelan Kline
Definitely affiliate managers. Because you're in the right department there as far as sponsorships or marketing, marketing channels, press pages, some people that are looking for press. A lot of the companies will have at the very bottom.  You can see Affiliate or Press or Marketing or Media, any of those kinds of channels will get you started in the right spot. And, you know, sometimes you got to start with someone that's in totally wrong department and just say in the PS like, "If this is the wrong person, can you point me in the right direction to the right person to contact?" And that's huge.

[00:22:44.350] - Elizabeth Stapleton
It does. It works really well. It would surprise you. People are like, this is not me. But instead of just ignoring it and not replying, they'll be like, "Oh, well, they know it might not be me, and I can pass this along." It always surprises me when that works because it's such a simple thing. So, any last bits of advice before...I know you've got something that you have for our audience, but any final words of advice?

[00:23:11.590] - Kelan Kline
Yeah. I think the biggest thing with all things blogging is, build your confidence. Know that you are an awesome individual to even go out on a limb and start your own project, start your own business. And sponsorships definitely it's a part of the blogging business that it takes a lot of confidence and takes a lot of encouragement to go out and do it. And you're going to hear a lot of Nos before your Yeses. So just get out there. Practice. Start with a small fish. Practice makes perfect. So just start working on the small fish and getting practice and getting experience and then slowly work your way up. And bloggers and online creation can get sponsorships everywhere. 

[00:23:46.270] - Elizabeth Stapleton
Awesome. Thank you. So, you want to tell the people that are watching what you have for them? The link is down below, but tell them a little bit about it.

[00:23:54.610] - Kelan Kline
Yeah. So, we have a sponsorship starter guide. It's our step-by-step strategy in landing sponsorships, and it has worked for us to build our blog to multiple six figures. It has worked for a bunch of other friends and other bloggers. So, definitely check it out. It's going to give you some really invaluable information to follow a step-by-step process to start landing sponsorships and increasing income.

[00:24:13.630] - Elizabeth Stapleton
I'm definitely going to have checked that out myself. Because I've never been the one for a lot of sponsorships. I think I've done like, three and I've been blogging for eight years. And then, I think you have something for people who purchase the Pro Pass as well.

[00:24:26.950] - Kelan Kline
Yeah. So we have a...A lot of our sponsorships are evergreen and really driven with SEO content and stuff that's going to market brands for a long time. So, we have a HARO strategy guide. It's our strategy and even email templates on how we answer HARO request, which is 'Help a Reporter Out' with big companies like Forbes, and Business Insider, and USA Today, answering those requests and getting backlinks and mentions on those so you can really exponentially grow your blog and build those backlinks for SEO traffic.

[00:24:56.170] - Elizabeth Stapleton
Yes. So if that's something that you're interested in, you should definitely make sure you guys grab the Pro Pass. Kelan, thank you so much. I appreciate you sharing all of your knowledge. And I look forward to seeing you guys continue to grow.

[00:25:09.010] - Kelan Kline
Appreciate it, Liz. Thank you.
