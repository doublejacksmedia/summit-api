Hello to everyone with the Blogger Breakthrough Summit! My name is Dr. Destini Copp, and I am so excited to be here with you today and you may be in one of these two categories. You may have a lead magnet, but for whatever reason it's just not converting for you. And you're thinking, you know, what should I do instead? Or maybe you are absolutely starting from scratch and you are trying to figure out what type of lead magnet should you create that would attract your perfect customer.

[00:00:44.530] - Destini
And if either one of those are you, you are in the right place today. Before I jump into the material, I just want to introduce myself. I am the host of The Course Creators MBA Podcast, Summit, Facebook and Instagram, ads consultant and a sales funnel expert. I help entrepreneurs create and sell online courses. In addition to all of that, I'm also a university marketing professor and a tennis player and a dog lover and you will find me on the tennis court throughout the entire year.

[00:01:18.430] - Destini
So let's jump right in. And you may be asking what is a lead magnet? And simply put, a lead magnet on it is a valuable piece of content that you give your audience for free in exchange for their name and their email address. So your goal is to build your email list and you may have more than one lead magnets. These are also referred to as maybe opt-ins.

[00:01:44.140] - Destini
For example, when you go to somebody's blog post, they may have a special opt-in for that particular blog post that is different from the main lead magnet on the front page of their website. In this training today, we're going to focus on your main lead magnet and we are going to make your lead magnet irresistible so that they have to sign up for your list when they come to your website. Maybe they're coming from social media, maybe you're in a Facebook group or you're sharing the link to your website.

[00:02:17.980] - Destini
We want them to come to your whatever landing page or whatever that you have your lead magnet on. And we want them to sign up and get on your email list. So let's talk about this in a little bit more detail. So your primary lead magnet begins the process to take your prospect on what we call the buyer's journey. So in marketing, there is something called the buyer's journey. You go through it whenever you go out to make a buying decision.

[00:02:49.240] - Destini
Let's just say you're buying a new washer-dryer for your house. You go through this buyer's journey to make that purchasing decision. Now, in the Awareness Stage of the buyer's journey, that is when your prospect becomes aware that they are that they have an issue, that they're experiencing pain. And this is when they start conducting research to understand their problem. They don't really know a lot about it right now. The Awareness Stage is when you want your prospect or your future customer to find you so you can start building the Know, Like, and Trust Factor.

[00:03:30.730] - Destini
Now, after the awareness stage, buyers move into the Consideration Stage. So in the Consideration Stage, this is when your prospects, they know what their issue is and they're researching all possible solutions to solve this particular problem. So they've defined the problem. They know what the problem is and they're going out and they're looking at different ways that they can solve this problem. So think about it this way. So let's just say that, you know that you need a new car and you're not really sure what kind of car that you want to buy.

[00:04:11.550] - Destini
You don't know if you want a pickup truck or SUV or, you know, just, you know, a sedan. So you're researching all of these possible solutions to solve this problem. That means you're in the Consideration Stage and then at some point you're going to move into the Decision Stage. Now, in the Decision Stage, this is when your prospects, they know how they're going to solve the problem and they're researching all possible brands of vendors that can solve this problem and will make a purchase decision.

[00:04:48.400] - Destini
So in this particular state, taking our vehicle issue as an example, you need a new vehicle, at this stage let's just say, you know, that you want an SUV, OK? And you know, you want a specific kind of SUV, maybe. You want a GMC Yukon. In this case, you are going out and there's a lot of different dealerships in your area that sell these type of cars, maybe you want a new one or used one. So you're going out and you're researching all the possible brands and vendors that can solve this issue and you are going to be making a purchase decision soon.

[00:05:31.720] - Destini
That means, that's why they call it the Decision Stage. So let's talk about what makes a good lead magnet. Now, a good lead magnet needs to be specific and related to your products and services. And the reason for that is your lead magnet is going to take them along that buyer's journey that we just talked about. We also want it to solve a real problem for them because if your lead magnet doesn't solve a real problem that your ideal customer has, or if it doesn't give them something that they really, really want, it's just not going to work for them.

[00:06:10.150] - Destini
And you also want it to demonstrate your expertise in why you're the best person to help them. You also want it to be high of high value, perceived value and actual value. You don't, you know, that is key to all of this and you want it to be delivered immediately so that they can have instant gratification. So that's a few things that make a good lead magnet. But let's talk about what makes a lead magnet worthy of a Facebook ad. Now, here's the key here.

[00:06:45.520] - Destini
You may have heard in the past that you need an easy to digest lead magnet. And I would agree with this to some extent. But, and again, you can give your new prospect, your new email subscriber bite-sized information, because you don't want to overwhelm them necessarily, but you need them to commit. You want somebody who's actually going to take action on your free gift. These are your future clients. You want people who are willing to actually do the work and they aren't looking for an easy fix.

[00:07:23.620] - Destini
You want people who are up for a challenge so they can get change in their life. Otherwise, what's going to happen is that your free gift is just going to sit in their email or even worse, they don't even bother to download or do anything with it. The bottom line is you don't want these freebie seekers. So many people fill up their lists with people who just want free stuff. That's not what we're going to do. We are going to ask them to invest their most important asset, which is their time.

[00:07:59.080] - Destini
So let's talk about this in a little bit more detail. I'm going to give you some specific examples here. What are some ways you can ask your prospect to invest their time? One is through a quiz. Now quizzes are fun and they're engaging. But it's also, you know, it's also asking them to actually spend some time going through it. A mini course is one of my favorite lead magnets, because, and also it can be particularly effective for online course creators because you're demonstrating your expertise.

[00:08:38.080] - Destini
They're engaging in your mini-course, they're, you know, finding ways or learning about how you teach. It can be great! Also, a mini-workshop series. I will give you a specific example of this in the Pass, and that is a great way to demonstrate your expertise. A mini-workshop series has been one of my best lead magnets. Also, training videos are great and you can combine these with a checklist or a cheat sheet or a workbook as a supplemental resource.

[00:09:13.360] - Destini
But I love training videos! Why? Because you are asking them to invest their time. Also another example is an audio file and an audio file, and this is basically something that they can listen to, you know, listen to some type of lead magnet that they can listen to. And it can be a very inspirational way to engage with your audience. And I'll give you some specific examples of these in just a second. Some other examples are printables with some type of informative training video. Also a budget spreadsheet with a how-to use it type of video. Scripts and swipe files are great lead magnets, but also make sure that you find a way to interact with them, along with these scripts and swipe files. For example, do a five-day email series explaining how to customize these swipe files. Also a resource list, if you do a resource list, make sure you have a how-to type of video for a specific resource showing them how to use it. Again, you're asking them to invest their time.

[00:10:29.820] - Destini
So all of those are super, super important. Now, here's an example for you. This is a mini-workshop series. Actually have this on the front page of my website. And it is simply a mini-workshop series that is delivered over a course of seven days. And I walk them through how to launch a high converting ad campaign in only five days, even if you are starting from scratch. So like on day one, you can see the day one video here.

[00:10:58.470] - Destini
I do have workbooks and worksheets throughout this. So they're getting the videos on days one through days five, along with some supplemental material. And it has been a great way to ask them to invest their time. But also this is definitely demonstrating my expertise so that'll give you some examples there. Here's another example. This is from Marie Forleo and this is her audio file or free audio training on how to get the clarity and confidence to build your dreams on your own terms.

[00:11:35.460] - Destini
And it's just an audio file that they can listen to. Here's another one that I absolutely love. And this is a seven-day free green smoothie challenge. So a great way to interact with them. You're asking them to invest their time. It's a great lead magnet. Here's something else. And the reason why I love these, this is a super easy lead magnet, it's something that they can go back to and use over and over again. I think this one was from Chris Carr, if I remember correctly.

[00:12:12.210] - Destini
And it is basically a stress relief meditation, it's a five-minute meditation file. It is something that they can go back to and listen to however many more times they want. It demonstrates her expertise and it is engaging. On the right here, what's your love language? This is an example of a quiz. So they go through and answer the questions and based on their answers, you're going to send them specific information that is customized based on their answers.

[00:12:44.910] - Destini
Again, you're asking them to invest their time. So if you are stuck and you just can't, you're thinking, oh my gosh, I don't know what kind of lead magnet to go with. Here's what I want you to do. In step one, I want you to research your industry and competitors. Think about what are they using? You're not going to copy what they're doing, but you're going to use this for inspiration and guidance. And then I want you to look outside of your industry.

[00:13:15.750] - Destini
What are other people doing? Is there anything that you could do that you like what they're doing, that you kinda think that you can apply to your own business? And then I want you to pay attention to Facebook and Instagram ads. What are others using for lead magnets to grow their email list? And can you get any inspiration from that? And also just sign up for people's email list. What are their lead magnets look like? And it's not like you're going to copy any of this.

[00:13:44.790] - Destini
You're just going to look at them and you're going to study them. And then I want you to ask yourself, what are the top questions you are asked by your ideal customer? And then think about your customers' biggest pain points. What are their migraines? What are they want to accomplish? How can you help them get there? And then think about what content could you provide that they would say, I can't believe this is free stuff. So you want to make sure that your lead magnet has very high value.

[00:14:19.170] - Destini
Now, here are some tools that you will want to use or that you'll need to have to create your lead magnet. Now you're going to need a Registration and a Thank You page. You can use a tool like LeadPages for that. You are going to need an email service provider. An example of this would be ConvertKit or MailChimp, any of those are fine. You're also going to need most likely some type of design tool I love Canva! It is super easy to use.

[00:14:50.400] - Destini
You can use Canva to create workbooks, cheat sheets, a bunch of different things. You also need a video recording tool, assuming that you're putting together some type of video which that is highly recommended in many cases, and then you may need some other type of other tool like a Google Drive. Let's just say you're delivering some type of spreadsheet, maybe even a budget spreadsheet to them, depending on your lead magnet, you might need some type of Google Drive to deliver any Word, you know, Google Docs or Google Sheets.

[00:15:26.580] - Destini
Now, here's an example of an email nurture sequence. So people are going to see your ad for your free lead magnet, or maybe you're in a Facebook group or you've posted a link for your lead magnet, or maybe you have it on your Instagram account, the link for your landing page. So they're going to go to Facebook or Instagram, they're going to see your link. They're going to go to your landing page for your free lead magnet, and then you're going to have a Thank You page.

[00:15:56.640] - Destini
Now, you may have some type of upsell or tripwire on that at some point in the future, but right now, let's just assume that you have a simple Thank You page and then you're going to add them to your email list and tag them with whatever lead magnet they signed up with. And you're going to deliver that email that lead magnet to them through email. You may have them go into another landing page, where they watch a video. So it depends on how you, what kind of lead magnet, how you would set all of that up.

[00:16:28.830] - Destini
And then you're gonna start your email nurture sequence. Now sometimes, this is called a welcome sequence, but this is one of the most important things you need to set up for your lead magnet. The last thing you want to do is to have them sign up on your list to send them your lead magnet and never follow up with them again. You want to start building that Know, Like and Trust Factor with them. So it is critical that you set up your email nurture sequence!
