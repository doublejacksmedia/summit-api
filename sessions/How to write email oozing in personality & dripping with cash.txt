[00:00:00.000] - Liz Stapleton
All right, guys. I'm so excited for today's session with Kate Doster. Welcome, Kate. She's incredible. So no, for reals though, I told you I was like, I'm just going to basically fan girl over you for our entire session because I've been blogging for over.

[00:00:19.340] - Liz Stapleton
Five years, a five and a half years. And I've done email marketing courses, and I've done... I know my way around from... I mean, my whole email marketing thing the last year, such a mess. Anyway, but I've taken email marketing courses. I've worked with email marketing strategists, and I bought your course last year, and I didn't start actually doing it until the end of the year. I think I bought it in like bad me. But I was like, I should have done it sooner. It's just literally, and I think when I asked you to do the summit, I was like, pretty, pretty please, will you do it? Because the number of mind blown emojis that you've done for me is just insane.

[00:00:59.340] - Liz Stapleton
I'm so thrilled to meet you.

[00:01:03.310] - Kate Doster
I am so excited. So the course that we're fan girl, both I fan girl with my own stuff sometimes. I'll be honest, you're like, damn, that girl is smart. It's like, Oh, it's yourself. So the course is love your list. We're called Love Your List. We call it Love Your List 2.0 because I did have a beta like everyone suggests, which I think is really, really smart. And we're always trying to improve it. And what I tell people is like, I'm not going anywhere. This is my full-time gig. This is how I support my family. So as I always tell people, especially toward that last email, I'm like, Go with your gut. I'm like, If you're going to wake up tomorrow and wish you just had this in the bag. So when you're ready to write a welcome series or write a sales page that is there for you, then buy it. And that's what a lot of people end up doing. And I try to tell people you can't get behind in the course. It's physically impossible because you're always going to have an idea for something new. You're always going to want to interact with your people and have your game.

[00:01:55.150] - Kate Doster
Love your list is just waiting there for you and all of our huge mammoth glory. I feel like I had.

[00:01:59.360] - Liz Stapleton
The same course, session, but I'm learning from you. It's at the top of my mind, but I just went through... I haven't gotten to the nurturing bit. It was just setting up my freebie. I'm like, well, I'm going to go through this again for my next freebie. Guys, I mean, so I set up... As you know, because I was posting the group, I set up my first freebie using your help. By the way, just the copywriting alone I learned from you. We'll have you teach some stuff because this is the action-oriented somewhere, for sure. But it was just like, I'm not naturally a writer. I have a math degree.

[00:02:39.120] - Kate Doster
I have a half a degree in accounting too.

[00:02:41.570] - Liz Stapleton
Yeah. I was like, even though I've been writing for, obviously five years, I actually was a full-time freelancer for a while, which is hilarious to me. The content is so good. And so my first review went live yesterday, I think, and it's already gotten... Which isn't necessarily time, but I really haven't promoted it on social media or anything. I just like posting a couple of groups like, Guys, what do you think I'd love feedback? And I've already got like, I don't know, 25, 30 people in 24 hours, which without really promoting, really saying a lot, I think.

[00:03:10.780] - Kate Doster
That's awesome. That's so awesome. I'm so excited. I get so excited for my students and then the people that they help, it just gets so exciting. It's like this is why I sell stuff.

[00:03:20.110] - Liz Stapleton
Yeah. And so I'd love for you to... Because I think you take a very different approach for most people, where everyone's like, email marketing is like a dollar for everyone on your list. And there's a lot of... I have read Russell Brunson's books, which do open up a different way of thinking, I think. But I think he does also fall into the category of the brosive or whatever. I'm not totally, he's a smart guy.

[00:03:44.610] - Liz Stapleton
So if you want to share your initial thoughts on the best way to approach email marketing.

[00:03:52.070] - Kate Doster
Sure. So I have nothing against Russell. I have to say, I feel like in his old age now, he's all 40. But I feel like in an old age he has softened a little bit. And if you look at my book, kids, I'm sure I have expert secrets and marketing secrets because I think when it comes down to everything is that you have to see what's out there and to expose yourself and test it and what works best for you.

[00:04:10.550] - Liz Stapleton
You could keep this from different places. That's for sure.

[00:04:13.720] - Kate Doster
Yeah. And then you mold it up into your own brain. And my headspace is so different from most people's that I mean, it's like, really, you're talking about big butts, actual rumps in your marketing? Yeah, obviously, who wouldn't? So we'll talk about the Sir Mixalot principle that it's named after in a little bit. But when you had first said that statistic of a dollar for a person on your email list, I'm like, Eew, you're doing it wrong. I'm just like, What? No, we don't. And that's the first thing that I really want to get to everyone is that I don't believe in logical results. That just doesn't happen. My students get a illogical result. You have to go in there with the mindset. I think what a lot of people when it comes to email marketing, yeah, obviously there are certain parts in their journeys, but they try to teach it like a machine, and they forgot about all of the touchy feeling, what? Right brain creative stuff that really goes into this.

[00:05:04.380] - Kate Doster
Treat people like people. And my particular people in general, that is one of their golden rules. They don't want people to feel like numbers. They want them feeling taken care of, understood and heard. And that's what really great copywriting can do for you. And this is copywriting with a W. And I have to tell people I'm not a blogger who hit it big with a resource library or a freebie, and then all of a sudden she's an email marketing guru. I got paid buku dollars for several years to write these things for other people. The way that I approach it is a lot different. Well, yes, obviously you need people to talk to. You talked about 35. Most people are like, Oh, only 35. I'm like, That's amazing, because I want 35. That landing.

[00:05:48.920] - Liz Stapleton
Page is converting at 38, 40 % right now.

[00:05:52.070] - Kate Doster
Of the right people. And that's key. It's the right people. It makes no sense. And the Russell Branson are like... I feel like the spin off now of Russell at this point. Yeah, because I feel like he's- We'll stop talking about him. The people that spin off of him are extremely bro hemey, extremely. And they're just like, You've got to put in $20,000 so you can get to a thousand dollars, and then burn the list, burn the list, burn the list. I don't want to burn the list. I'm like, I would much rather start with 5,000 of the right people. I need to get myself out there, obviously. It's my job to find them. But when I do like, I don't feel like I sell to people. People just buy for me. And that's because I don't make stuff about me. Obviously, yes, we talked about I was a copywriter. So that way you know this chick's got credit. Yes, I make sales every single day. There's no reason that it just doesn't happen. It does. But that's not what I'm leading with. I'm not like, Oh, you can make sales every day. It's like, look at how amazing we can get you out to your people.

[00:06:47.330] - Kate Doster
And that's always what my people want. And so when you know about your people and what they want and what drives them and what trips them up, all of it just becomes so much easier. I think that you had posted right that you had gone through other email marketing courses, but this was like, the first welcome series that you can actually feel like it's you. And I'm like, that's what I want people to have. I'm going to give you guideposts, but you've got to know your people.

[00:07:08.890] - Liz Stapleton
So I first heard of you when you did Rebel Boss Summit last year because I did that as well. And then I ended up getting your course through Carly Campbell, who's also part of the summit. I'm super excited.

[00:07:20.110] - Kate Doster
Love Carly. Yes.

[00:07:23.190] - Liz Stapleton
And I was like, yeah. And then when I finally dug into it, I remember watching the first module not long after I bought, and I was like, oh, my gosh. But then life got busy and I didn't really dig in. I'm super excited that you linked to one of my resources. I was like, right.

[00:07:38.780] - Kate Doster
Oh, my gosh. It's good stuff, guys.

[00:07:43.770] - Liz Stapleton
Two things that you really blew my mind with was that it just changed the way I thought about it and the way I approached it. Because I did dread having to do email. And I haven't been great about email on my list, but I am now because I just started a whole new one. Anyway, the the make your subscriber feel like a badass. I think that changes your approach to how you write. But I think the other thing that changes how you go out there and promote yourself is, it's my job to get in front of that person. So they don't get the bad advice. Like, I would have gotten to you sooner if you did. That approach, I was like Of course.

[00:08:18.520] - Kate Doster
 because all the Billy Brohems don't shut up. And that was always my biggest critique of myself too. And the other thing that we talked about is being on your list is a privilege. It's not even like I'm thirsty. I'm like begging people to be on my list. No, my freebie is the velvet rope. It is a velvet rope. I do know on everyone because I know that I can't help everyone. And what do I want to make people feel bad about themselves? And they're like, Oh, it's working for adults. Again, no, I'd be the jerk. So I'm only going to set up things for people that I know that I can help. And then they're happy. And then I'm happy. And then everybody is happy. And that's the thing is that we need to be louder. We need to show up in their inboxes. And when you give yourself permission to just be like, Oh, these are people that are just as excited or excited. I don't know all of you eat and breathe email marketing like I do, but you're excited to help your people. And I get to talk to you every single week.

[00:09:10.370] - Kate Doster
It just makes me so excited to email my list because what are they doing? And people were like, back.

[00:09:15.360] - Liz Stapleton
I've gotten replies back to my welcome series already that people just started doing yesterday, two days ago, whatever.

[00:09:23.680] - Kate Doster
I.

[00:09:24.610] - Liz Stapleton
Was like, that's such a great idea. Thanks for everything. This is awesome. I'm like.

[00:09:28.640] - Kate Doster
I don't know, because they can feel your energy. I think that that's what makes my approach so different. Obviously, yes, there's some science behind it and all that, obviously, but it's that feeling behind it. When people can feel your excitement, it also makes them feel like a badass. It's when you're putting yourself in their shoes and someone asks me on a different, How can you put yourself in people's shoes? I'm like, I don't know. I'm like, I just I can't not do it. I don't know if it was because the former musical theater actor in me, the sympathy. I'm like, I don't know. You can just think. What would the other person think? Well, sometimes.

[00:10:03.980] - Liz Stapleton
In a lot of cases, it's not so much putting yourself in other people's shoes. It's putting yourself in your own shoes five years ago or three years ago or whatever. Because the freebie I just did, I couldn't believe I could have been thinking of this sooner, but I was like, when I and then the paid upgrade that I thought of, I was like, When I figured out how to do this. I was like, Oh, my God. I did magic. I told my friends that I did. And I was like, Why am I not... And in my head, I was like, I've got to teach this, but I hadn't figured out how. And it was like, I should have done this already. So I'm pretty excited about it. But yeah. So I think your approach of treat people like people because it makes it not enjoyable for them. You're not selling something, but it makes more enjoyable for you. We didn't all get into blogging to constantly blog where we have no lives who are trying to get conversion rate or whatever. So I think that's an excellent point. Because I think we spark some interest.

[00:10:58.380] - Liz Stapleton
Let's touch on the Sir Mix-A-Lot principle.

[00:11:01.660] - Kate Doster
Oh, I love that Sir Mix-A-Lot principle. We like the.

[00:11:04.620] - Liz Stapleton
Big butts.

[00:11:06.320] - Kate Doster
Okay. One of the core foundations of everything, and this is what I think we do in the freebie module. And when I tell everyone like, Hey, even if you've got one, you should still listen to this because it's secretly the backbone of the whole Love Your List system. And that is working on butts. So if you guys are like, Oh, and he grew up and you know the song Sir Mix-A-Lot Baby got back, literally, he's just singing and then Nicky Minaj- -did it like- -Even.

[00:11:29.930] - Liz Stapleton
If you know Sir Mix a Lot.

[00:11:31.600] - Kate Doster
-whole thing, right? So the Sir Mix a Lot principle is when you are creating a freebie or an easy as offer, even when you're like, which I write in these emails, you have to think of the yeah, buts that people are going to have because that is where you make that big connection. It's like, yeah, I want to start a blog, but I don't have any money. Yeah, I want to start a blog, but I don't know the tech. Yeah, but I don't know what to write about. Yeah, but I don't know how to get people to read it. Yeah, but I don't know Pinterest. Yeah, but... And then this is where you have to get all of this literally out on a piece of paper. I wish I had them. I have literally legal pads full of this stuff about my people, more so than like, Oh, she drives a Honda, but wishes it was a Tesla. Who doesn't?

[00:12:09.320] - Liz Stapleton
Which most of the avatars are like, you know- No. -but it doesn't dig it. I was like, the research, because I've been told how to do market research before and how I did it before versus how I did it with your method was completely transformative. It was the Yeah, but.

[00:12:22.470] - Kate Doster
And so when you start getting like that surface level stuff like, Yeah, I don't get the tag. It's Yeah, but I try things before, but it failed. Yeah, but what if people don't like it? Yeah, but what if people actually read my blog and they do it, but they don't get results? Yeah, but what if I get haters? Yeah, but what if this takes away time from my family? Yeah, but what if I feel like a bad mom? And so when you start at the surface level of the butts, if you will, you get deeper not to sound gross, guys. But then when you get deeper and you start like, we'll go with the the onion example. When you start peeling away these layers, you're just like, Crap. That's it. So one of the people who buy my course, they usually love your list, they do tend to be, not like smaller, but medium bloggers, but they're a little bit concerned about if they get the big guys, the Abbies and all these other people, still like, Girls in Her Blog, you know what I mean? That they're going to lose that personal connection with their audience, that almost they're not going to be themselves anymore.

[00:13:21.060] - Kate Doster
So in one of my emails, it's my job to show you you can still infuse your personality, and you can take care of people in these emails. And then your only job is to make sure people are seeing this and then helping the people at the bottom because we've got the whole middle part taken care of. And so they're like, Oh, my goodness. How did she know that that's something I was concerned about? Because I know my people. If you don't know what to say because you don't know your people well enough in this way. So that's really... And we'll talk about mechanic stuff too.

[00:13:48.710] - Liz Stapleton
Pretend you're Joe in You, but in the non murderous way.

[00:13:52.400] - Kate Doster
Exactly, right? Exactly. Right? Exactly. I think that we don't spend our... Because people are saying, She does this, and she wants to make money every day. Well, what is she going to do with that? Is your person the type that wants to go to Gucci every day? That's her goal? Or is it that she just wants to go to Whole Foods and buy organic beef and raspberry and not care that it's winter. So that's what you need to figure out is what does that vision actually look like for your person? Again, what does losing weight look like for them? Is it that they don't want to have to ask for an airplane extender because they don't want that embarrassment? Or is it that they want to place fifth in a bodybuilding competition and they want to just feel ripped and like they did it? You know what I mean? You need to know on that spectrum, what do your readers actually want? And you get to pick that because you get to pick to you attract because being on your list and reading your blog is a privilege. So you have to be like, Well, I don't know what they want.

[00:14:50.540] - Kate Doster
You literally get to make it up. And then you will attract these people. I don't want to say that it's magic, but it is. That's what happens because they catch your vibe.

[00:14:59.210] - Liz Stapleton
Yeah, absolutely. No, I think that's. Completely on point.

[00:15:03.570] - Liz Stapleton
And then once you start figuring that out and you're looking for... Because one of the things you do is if you're struggling to find out, yeah, but go look. Because people will literally write, I want yeah, but or Sorry about the rant. This or that was a huge... I was like, yeah. And I just kept making notes and it was like a huge thing. Anything that was a rant related to talk that I wanted to be talking about and helping people with, I was like, Oh my God, I could have helped her. I feel so bad that she feels guilty that she's away from her child to work on her blog or the nap time hustle only works if your kid naps or...

[00:15:44.510] - Kate Doster
And you don't have to come out and say, and I don't really know what the proper word is to say this, but you don't have to come out and say how to blog and not feel guilty. It can just be a general overtone or it can be a little bit of a story where you're sharing-.

[00:15:59.400] - Liz Stapleton
I don't like that. To the volunteer in their classroom. You're like, Yeah, I've got time for that.

[00:16:03.720] - Kate Doster
Exactly. You know what I mean? And letting them forgive themselves for being like, Oh, even something that you had said, and I know you're in the course, you don't care anymore. But it's like, Oh, I should have done this sooner. It's like, Let her know. It's okay. You weren't ready to do this sooner or your people weren't ready to hear this yet. And when you give people permission to not be so hard on themselves because they.

[00:16:25.750] - Liz Stapleton
Know that they're working- Everyone is their own worst critic.

[00:16:28.360] - Kate Doster
Right? Then all of a sudden they're like, Oh, my goodness. I can't. I keep on telling people, you'll see this a lot in the business to business space. Again, every market, as I'd like to call them or every group is going to be a little bit different. But for us, it's a lot of forgiving ourselves for not getting there sooner. You know what I mean? And that's the little stuff that we need to be in. And it's the fact that you're still trying. Do you know how many people? We are nuts. Everyone who's watching this stuff right now, this isn't what normal people do.

[00:16:56.550] - Liz Stapleton
-you think no one in your family knows what you're doing.

[00:16:59.150] - Kate Doster
No, this isn't what normies do. Normal people, no offense to others, and I don't feel bad about them. I love the fact that there are people who have jobs because I need people to employ. I'm all for that lifestyle. But the fact that I can make in a month or I actually do make in a month, what I used to make in a year, it's just bonkers for everyone else. But they're not necessarily brave enough or courageous enough at the stage that they're at to take that leap of those zero dollar months. You need to have the fortitude. And for whatever topic that you are talking about, whether it is blogging, whether it is eating, whether it is organization, whether it is more of a lifestyle blog and it's just dressing better, there is always that thing up against it that you can address. So it's like, I picked out outfits and they've looked horrible. Or it's like, I've been concerned about I don't have money to really invest in these pieces. So what do I do? Really to think about the heart of your person, and that's the way I do marketing.

[00:18:00.490] - Kate Doster
And that's why I don't have to sell. I'm like, You're not going to annoy people. I was.

[00:18:05.850] - Liz Stapleton
Just going to say, you don't have to sell. I like that you don't use the term tripwire. It's an easy yes offer, which I was like, I like that better too. It just makes you feel better to be like, I'm just giving you a solution. You don't have to take it, but I thought it might help.

[00:18:23.440] - Kate Doster
Yeah. I'm not going to... So a tripwire, and I know that you guys have probably talked about this in other session, is when you offer something on a thank you page. And so a lot of people, again, a lot of my students, because I know that they have an adversity to selling, they feel bad. Like, Oh, I can't believe it. But it's like if you sat down to create something, don't be a jerk and not tell them for four days. If it is aligned, if it is not teaching the exact same thing that your freebie teaches, tell them about it. Some people are quick starts and they're going to want it. Other people are going to need a couple of days, and that's fine. You don't have to offer it for a discount if it's going to make you feel bad. Offer it be like, Hey, it's $17 here, and don't tell them later that it's going to be $17, but offer it for $17 again. It's just for people who want more help. It's just for people that want actions. That's why it's an easy yes and not a trip wire where I'm blowing them up.

[00:19:14.450] - Kate Doster
And now I'm freaking them out for cash. I'm like, no. No, you said that you want help with X. Once you finish that, which my freebie is going to do, you're going to need Y. Here's something that's literally going to do Y for you. And most people are like, Oh, yeah.

[00:19:27.810] - Liz Stapleton
In the group, because I've posted get feedback in the group, they're like, So are you going to tell me about this again later? Because I didn't get it on the easy yes, because I'm just one of those people that needs time. I was like, not yet that I'm working on it. I'm like, I'm going as fast as I can. I know it's my job to get it in front of you so that you have this, I'm really sorry. I promise. So I'll tell you more about it later. Right? And then just like, Oh, yeah.

[00:19:54.780] - Kate Doster
Because again, even with the content, the blogs, the videos, whatever you're putting forward, like sometimes people just need a little bit more. Like, it's like, Oh, are they all sizzle and no steak? It's just like, yeah. And so that's what you can do for your emails. And I'm sure they'll talk about it a little bit like, Oh, what do you send in your emails? And all that. Obviously, we're going to talk about that part too. She's like, Yeah.

[00:20:16.340] - Liz Stapleton
I mean, emoji over and over again. Because your first module, I mean, you guys, how well she knows her audience is insane. Because I was like.

[00:20:27.030] - Liz Stapleton
She knows me so well. It's a little bit. And so when I was emailing her, I was like, not to be creepy, but I spent winter break with you watching her videos. But she was like, If you haven't been consistent about take care of your current subscribers, here's what you send them each month and I was like, Duh. How did I not think of that?

[00:20:47.590] - Kate Doster
I love that. And I think again, you've got to forgive yourself. And this is a lot different from everyone else, if you can't tell. I don't have a different drummer. I've got a ukulele that keeps my beat. They're right in front of me right now. It's not a drummer. I don't apologize for not emailing people. I'll go in if there's been a time where I tell my students it's something that I know is valuable. We talk about usually resources or apps, and then you say at the bottom it's like, hey, wondering how you got in this email list. I've got to answer this question. It's like, you signed up for this. And then we have this whole thing, and when you break it down to, all right, just say you're going to email your list once a week. I think that in this month right now, I think there would be like five weeks-ish, but it's usually about three to five emails, period. Then we're like, Oh, I only need to create four emails? It's not that bad all of a sudden. Maybe one of them you want to send a blog post. Maybe you're not quite sure what blog post you're going to create this month.

[00:21:43.590] - Kate Doster
That's fine. Ask them a question. Send them a best-up thing. Just talk about what happened on your weekend and be like, Oh, how can I relate it to my person? And then there you go. Then your emails are set. It's not that big of a deal.

[00:21:58.490] - Liz Stapleton
Yeah. It's one of those things that like... Because I feel like there's so many courses on growing your list since grow, grow, grow, whereas you're like, No, I don't want everybody, which is a different approach. But there are very few courses are like, What do you send what's there? And that is not talked about enough in the blogging space and blog post or whatever. And I haven't gotten to this part of your course, so I don't know what you say about continuing nurturing. But if you want to give me a little preview of what I'm going to learn, just a couple of tips. So people are like, you know... Because there is the welcome sequence, which I think most people are... They know what that is. Then it's like once they get through that, they're like, well, what now?

[00:22:38.360] - Kate Doster
Awesome. So I love this question. And again, I love your honesty. So we don't have to make a mountain out of a mole hill. Again, I think that a lot of us, because we're driven so much to help, we do tend to make mountains out of mole hills constantly. So literally what you can do is there's really two different ways that you can nurture your list. If you're the type of person where like me, you're like, I feel like marketing, even though there's some tried and true, things change. Things are different. So I really like interacting with my people in a live time. So I will send my four newsletters. I tell people at the beginning to make it a day in time. I'm going to send every Wednesday. I'm going to send every Thursday. I typically send on Friday. Sometimes I'll send on Tuesday, but usually definitely by Friday, I'll go ahead and I'll send something. So I'll sit down and I'm like, Okay, what do I have coming up this month? What do I know my people are going to be focusing on? So it could be one of these things I know a lot of people at the time they're recording this is still like 2020.

[00:23:34.760] - Kate Doster
You know when this is going live? It's 2020. People really want to go and hit their goals hard. So it's like, okay, what do I have around that? In your industry, it might be like, Oh, a lot of people want to eat healthy. So I want to send four emails, maybe some best recipes that I have, maybe something that I've got coming up, maybe a stumbling block story that I have for myself, and then maybe some cool apps that I like to have because people are going to be interested in that. Well, we just created your whole month of content. Now, either you can choose to sit down and write it all in one shot. Maybe some months you're going to do that because then you know you'll actually do it and schedule it out. Maybe some you're just going to be like, You know what? Tuesday, I'm just going to sit down, and that's just going to be my email day. Maybe. And it's just like, Oh, okay. And then the other approach for people that want a more hands-off approach, I guess, aren't as obsessed as I am, and this isn't bad, is if you know yourself and you know that you're those people where it's like for a month you might be consistent, but then you tend to fall off the wagon and you do have some stuff that's more evergreen, it's almost creating like a second welcome series, if you will.

[00:24:38.570] - Kate Doster
Again, and this is what I tell the students in the welcome series module, it can be as short as five, but if you need it to be 15, then have it be 15 or 10 or 12, and you can always add to it after. Because like, Oh, yeah, it's this. What do you include? Again, if you've been on a podcast or if you've been on a summit, your core modality that you help people with. Usually, most people, as they've been at this for a while, are developed frameworks like, Oh, you need to have A, B and C. Maybe it's a little bit about that. Maybe it's just asking them questions. Then every once in a while, you'll pop in their inbox when you've got something going on real time. It's just knowing yourself and how you operate. For some people, it is doing that in real time, seeing what works. That's like, Okay, well, if this is about mint Julip Day, I can't have that in an autoresponder because someone could get a non-Mint Julip of day. I'll need to do something a little bit different. But then how can you make it a little bit more evergreen?

[00:25:40.600] - Liz Stapleton
Yeah.

[00:25:41.330] - Liz Stapleton
I think that's a great point because I did do that actually for my old site, something similar. Obviously, very different. Now I'm figuring things out. But I like that you're covering that and you do focus on.

[00:25:54.490] - Kate Doster
That because I know...

[00:25:55.410] - Liz Stapleton
So another question. Because I don't know a single blogger that only takes one course. You know? -it's like email.

[00:26:04.080] - Kate Doster
-no, you shouldn't.

[00:26:04.940] - Liz Stapleton
Yeah, email is so important. They're like, Your blog is your marketing point. But your email is where you really connect with people. So if you have to skip either getting a blog post out that week or email, skip the blog post. Email is where you get to really... It's basically building up your own group of friends, guys.

[00:26:21.020] - Kate Doster
And people, again, know the butts and the modality, especially when it comes to emails. We don't want to annoy people. We've all gotten bad emails or really rohime emails, but people like getting good emails. And don't psych yourself out. Oh, I don't send... What if I send bad emails? You won't when you are thinking about your person and how you can make their lives better and sharing a little bit of you and your quirkiness. And again, making it about them feeling successful or feeling like they're not alone or just giving them the cool insider tip like, Oh, I have this app. I can make this done. Then they're always going to enjoy your emails. And everyone's like, Oh, well, do you have a specific length? It's like, it doesn't matter if it's one sentence or a million. I mean, know if it's a million, you've got to make sure it's broken up and it's going to be good because not everyone goes to their inbox to read like they would a book. I think that's sometimes what people tend to forget. Again, treat people like people, when they're going to their inboxes, it's usually like a quick hit of inspiration or a quick let's do this type of a thing.

[00:27:26.480] - Kate Doster
They don't necessarily want an ultimate guide in their actual inbox, but they will read it if you put it in a PDF, treat people like people, and they'll be more excited. I'll do that every once in a while, especially for my people who get bloggers who love writing ultimate guides, or even if you have a really great post, even though I know that you probably want traffic, whether you're doing Mediavine or something else, consider turning it into a quick PDF in Canva. You can add that to your welcome series, or you can just send that to your subscribers, and people love it. And all you're doing is literally upcycling stuff that you already have, and it's building up such goodwill. It's like, that's one of my favorite things to do every now and then. I'm just like, oh, here's the Black Friday guide. It was based off a podcast, and you can read the blog post. Here it is. Here's a couple of worksheets to help you out. Would you really just like blank pages? People love them. I like making them. It's like, okay.

[00:28:17.980] - Liz Stapleton
Yeah, because especially it's so funny because when you first start blogging, you're like, Oh, my God. You're so nervous to publish anything. And it's like, no one's reading yet. Right.

[00:28:30.160] - Kate Doster
Those.

[00:28:31.000] - Liz Stapleton
Are things because you probably put a lot of effort into it. You can totally go back to those, redo them, republish them, turn them into a PDF. That's a great point. But I always like when I'm like, I don't know where to start. I'm like, Hey, well, how would I tell my friends about this? And take that approach. Like you said, you want them to be good friends to you. That's why you're attracting those people and it makes a difference.

[00:28:53.240] - Liz Stapleton
And clean your list.

[00:28:54.220] - Liz Stapleton
And stuff. But I know we are... I don't know how much of your chat we've already taken up. It's okay.

[00:28:59.490] - Kate Doster
I'll chat about this stuff forever.

[00:29:01.650] - Liz Stapleton
Because you love it. But you are giving a great freebie open rate catapult. Can you tell what that is so we can... People know to go get it. I mean, they should know to get it from you guys. When you're like, they're going to... I've said this with another speaker too. I'm on her email list. I'm obviously on her email list. And then whenever I see her name, I like star them. That was like, if I don't have.

[00:29:22.380] - Kate Doster
Time to read them, I'm coming back. Yeah. Right. And that's why I tell people like, oh, subject lines don't matter that much. And they're like, What? Because everyone wants great subject lines. I'm like, Yeah, open rates are fine. You should also know, and we talked about this in the masterclass that you guys are getting access to as well. Sometimes on mobile, it has a hard time registering open. So some people might actually be opening your stuff. Spoiler, your open rate could be higher. But really, the thing that causes people to open and email the most, just like you said, is the name. There are certain people who I just enjoy their stuff. Usually it's a little bit more personable. It always has to deal with what I'm interested in learning about from them. It's not super in left field. Or if it is, they can turn it around to be like, and this is how it appears to you. And here's why buying a new plant is going to help you with this. Even if you talk about cooking, you know what I mean? If you just turn it around.

[00:30:15.350] - Liz Stapleton
I want sent an email that was about shaving my legs and relate it to affiliate marketing.

[00:30:19.820] - Kate Doster
Yeah, right. I literally have. Actually, we were literally just talking about Love Your List because it's not always perfect. I forgot to include a template in there. I think we're going to add more too because I'm just like, I like creating and stuff. I literally turned how I locked my keys in my car into an email that generated thousands of dollars. Okay? So you can literally take something that was crappy. How can you relate it to the overall bigger principle of things? And then if you've got something to sell, you can ask at the end. We call it the 10K Blueprint. I don't want to say it's that hard. Once you start practicing it, you're like, Oh, because everyone's like, How can I add more of myself in the emails? I hate it when people talk about their lives. You hate about it when they drone on and on and on. But when they relate it to something that you care about, they're going to read. And that's how people feel like they're my best friends because they'll know my word of the year or that I like to go into the sprinkler park and actually be in it as opposed to being the parent on their phone, like miserable.

[00:31:14.330] - Kate Doster
Why would I want to be hot? That's dumb. And allowing yourself to use your own vernacular and all of that great stuff. Again, you're going to notice a lot of what I teach, it's a lot of what I teach. It's to be you, but to always make it about your person at the same time. So the open rate catapult, we talk about ways to really jish up your subject line, how to actually make it some people see your name and they get excited. It's very concrete, like do this and do that and all of this stuff. So you guys head on over to katedoster.com/openrate. You will get it there. I think we have a handout to go with it as well. It's told right for that course.

[00:31:47.930] - Liz Stapleton
They'll totally be able to grab it there for sure. But definitely, guys, everything she sends out is just gold. It's going to, Mike, drop, blow your mind. It continues to. I've been just powering through her course. I had to take a break after module two because it was the copywriting.

[00:32:08.050] - Liz Stapleton
It's a lot to absorb.

[00:32:09.220] - Kate Doster
It's a big one.

[00:32:10.740] - Liz Stapleton
It is.

[00:32:11.500] - Liz Stapleton
I wrote the notes very quickly while watching news because you do talk quickly, which I appreciate because I've fully done that. Of course, this is where I speed them up.

[00:32:20.260] - Kate Doster
I teach people how to slow mine down and speed them up. You're very excited.

[00:32:27.530] - Liz Stapleton
I rewrote the notes neatly afterwards, just so I could go over it all again to help it release again, which I feel like they're definitely going to watch this video. Need to watch this video more than once to get everything you said to sink in. Definitely. Definitely check her out, guys. Go to the freebie, open your... Because it is. I've taken it. It's fantastic. So thank you so much.

[00:32:50.170] - Kate Doster
Thank you guys so much. So remember guys, just being on your list is a privilege. People do want to hear from you. And if they unsubscribe, I don't think it was like, oh, like our objection on myself. I mean, you know on Instagram, at least for a while, the modality was follow, unfollow. Nobody really cares that much. I think that with emails, people get afraid because they're like, Oh, what if I get a slap on the face? They'll unsubscribe. You can think of it as just like, again, true people like people. Maybe they've already solved their problem and good for them. I'm excited that they've got it done. That's amazing. I hope I played a small part. Maybe they're just Marie condoing their inbox and everybody went like, It's okay. It is okay. You're right people are going to be there and you're always going to find more people to help. You just have to know not only what to say to them, but how to say it and give yourself permission to do it. That's really what Love Your List is just about. But thank you guys so much for having me. Oh, listen to my podcast.

[00:33:43.840] - Kate Doster
I always forget it. Inbox Besties is my podcast. It's everywhere. Itunes, Stitcher, Google Play, where we talk week after week, email marketing, copywriting, business, mindset stuff, all of that goodness. I interview people who to help fill in the gaps because I don't everything. So Inbox Besties guys, is probably one of the second best places to hang out with me besides my inbox. Yes.

[00:34:07.340] - Liz Stapleton
Definitely check it out. I'd listen to it. She's got some great episodes on there. Thank you again. And just everyone, go check it out. We'll catch you at the next session.

[00:34:17.280] - Kate Doster
Bye.
