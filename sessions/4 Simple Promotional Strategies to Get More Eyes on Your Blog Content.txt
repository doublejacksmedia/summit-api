Hey, you all. Welcome to my presentation on four simple promotional strategies to get more eyes on your blog content. I'm just getting over a cold, so if I sound a little froggy, that's why. Who am I? I am Sarah Jane. I'm a copywriter, content strategist, and content marketer. I've been doing this for 12 years, working with both huge companies like IBM and Intuit and small businesses. Today, I work with a lot of coaches, creative, service providers that own their own small business. My goal is to help businesses grow their audience, build trust, and make fat stacks of cash, which I think we can all agree is a goal at some point. I've worked with a lot of different brands, and now I'm focused on helping small businesses, entrepreneurs. My focus is typically on content marketing without manipulation. So just instead of tricking people into buying your stuff, just being honest and creative about how to talk about the value and all that stuff. So that's me. Let's get into what you'll learn today. So these are four promotional strategies, ways to get more eyes on your blog content. And for each of these four, I'm going to go through three basic things.

[00:01:48.430] - Sarah Jane Burt
So the first thing is simple ways to promote your blog content. So what that strategy is, the reason for this, so you can grow your audience and make some money. The second part will be how to get started with each strategy. A lot of the times, things that you learn at summits like this can be a little overwhelming. You're learning so much from so many different people, and you have so many things now on your to-do list. It can be really overwhelming to even know where to get started. So for each of these tactics, I've given you the one thing you can do to get started with the strategy. The goal is for you to take some action and start making some progress. And then some tips for being successful. So for some of these, if you are a little more advanced, some of these you may already be doing. So some of these tips are pro tips for those of you who have not used the strategy yet. These are just helpful ways to be successful so that your time, effort, energy, and sometimes money is well spent.

[00:02:56.240] - Sarah Jane Burt
So before we get into it, I just want to clarify simple does not equal, easy, or quick. So a lot of the times in the online business space, in the content creation space, you'll hear a lot of people talk about quick and easy ways to make a bajillion dollars or to create five million blog posts in an hour. If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. With that in mind, all of these tactics are simple in the sense that you can wrap your mind around them very easily, and they're easy to get started with. They don't require any special skills or money to get started. However, they are not necessarily easy. A lot of these are a bit time intensive, so they're not quick either. By simple, I just mean anyone can do these, can use these strategies to grow their audience to get more eyes on their blog post, but that doesn't necessarily mean that they are easy.

[00:04:05.000] - Sarah Jane Burt
So with that warning in mind, let's get started. So the first tactic, you're probably rolling your eyes at this and thinking, "Duh, Sarah", is to share on social. But I'm going to give you a few hopefully interesting ways to think about this. So don't underestimate the power of social media when it comes to getting eyes on your content. It's a really great way to grow your audience, right? So when you have an email list or something, you share your content with your email list, those are people that have already they've signed up, they're part of your audience. But on social media, you can talk to people who are not already part of your audience. They can find you through different ways. So don't underestimate the power of that. It's a great place to build an audience. And if someone likes what you have to say in short form, your social posts, then they'll likely really like your blog content where you get a little more in-depth.

[00:05:06.920] - Sarah Jane Burt
So how to get started here? And so even if you're already posting on social, you're already active on a couple of different channels. If you're not consistently posting, I want you to think about this as a starting place for consistently posting, right? So most of us are probably on social. So I'm not going to say how to get started is to sign up for a social platform, but to get started posting consistently, to get started getting results from this, I want you to pick one social media channel to focus on. And I'm serious about that. I know how it can be if you're ambitious, if you're efficient. You might think, well, I can post on four different channels, the same content, whatever. Just to get yourself in the mindset of doing one thing really well, I want you to focus on one social media channel. If you're able to post on the others, great, but I want you to focus on that one as your core channel. And then once you're able to post there consistently, move on to something else. Not move on, but add something else to your channels.

[00:06:22.470] - Sarah Jane Burt
Commit to posting there consistently each week. What does consistency look like? It's really how often can you post on a consistent basis? So if you can only commit to posting three times a week, then post three times a week. You're not consistent until you've done it, I would say, for a couple of months at least. So focus on that. In terms of how often you should post? It depends on the channel. So just go by what the best practices are. So, for instance, Twitter or X, people will post three to five times a day, whereas on LinkedIn, mostly people will post once a day and mostly Monday through Friday.

[00:07:09.920] - Sarah Jane Burt
So when you find a channel that you really want to focus on, just consider what are the best practices for that channel. Now, in terms of getting more eyes on your actual blog post. So the end goal might be to get them to read the post, subscribe to your blog or your email newsletter, but you have to earn trust before you can get them there. So instead of, I've seen this a lot, people will just post links to their blog, sometimes with a little teaser, and that's their post. However, people are not going to click on that link unless they know you, they like you, they trust you, especially with phishing scams and all that stuff. So what you want to do is you want to take that blog content, repurpose it into social posts so that you're sharing the valuable information there so they can get to know you, like you, trust you, and then you can point them to the blog for more details.

[00:08:12.880] - Sarah Jane Burt
So for instance, let's say you are in... A lot of my examples are probably going to be in marketing just because that's the niche I'm in, so it's easiest to talk about. Let's say you write a blog post about your "10 Favorite SaaS Tools for SEO." You're not just going to list all 10 in the post and say, if you want more information, go here, whatever. You might focus a post on each of those 10. So you write 10 different posts that focus on one tool, and then the end says, I've got a whole list of great tools for other aspects of your SEO. If you want to read more, check out my blog. So it's not just about summarizing the blog post and then putting a link to the post. It's more about taking the valuable tidbits that you've got in that blog post, repurposing them for social. And then if people like that and they want more detail, then they can go to read the blog post. But that's how you're going to build that trust to get people to actually go to your site later on.

[00:09:27.160] - Sarah Jane Burt
Some tips: focus on one channel. I'm very serious about that. I am an overachiever. I have tried to do multiple channels. I'm just going to start posting everywhere all the time. It doesn't work. So focus on one channel. Once you get consistent there, then add a channel, right? And if you're able to, let's say, you are able to stay consistent and you post every once in a while on another channel, that's totally fine. But you want to make sure that one channel gets all of your attention and your consistency before you move on. Set aside some time in your calendar to get this done. So, for example, I have on my calendar every day, Monday through Friday at 8:30 to post to LinkedIn and engage on LinkedIn. My core channel has changed over time. Right now it's LinkedIn. So that's where I spend most of my time. If I'm able to post on Facebook or Instagram during the week, that's great. But LinkedIn is that one place that I always post Monday through Friday. I always engage. And so I just set aside that time in my calendar, and it really has helped me get more consistent. Now, do I occasionally miss that half hour in my calendar? Sure. I post content ahead of time, so the content is still Monday through Friday going out. Sometimes I miss that engagement piece, but it's always on my calendar. There's always space for it.

[00:11:07.350] - Sarah Jane Burt
Engage 15 minutes before and after you post. This is just a thing for the algorithm. When it sees you engaging, it's more likely to then show your content to people. Also, when you are engaging on someone else's post, they are more likely to then go look at your profile and engage with your content. It doesn't always happen, but they're more likely to, when they see engagement from you, reciprocate that engagement. So if you get on for 15 minutes before you post, so since I schedule my post ahead of time, what I'll do is at 8:30, I might schedule the post for 8:45 or 8:40. I'll get on at 8:30, start engaging, and then the post goes live. I don't manually post it, and then I continue engaging for the full half hour. So that's 30 minutes out of every day that I do that. And in the grand scheme of things, it's really not taking away from my time doing other stuff. It's really, I finished my coffee, I engaged on LinkedIn, and I've been able to keep consistent with that.

[00:12:17.890] - Sarah Jane Burt
You also want to create a repeatable process for repurposing. So sometimes when people think of repurposing, they think of just maybe copying and pasting pieces of it into something else. But honestly, repurposing, you can do it a lot of different ways. It really depends on the channel that you're posting stuff on. So for my longer pieces, for my blog posts, my YouTube videos, my emails, my longer pieces of content, I'll repurpose into post for different channels. And so I do have a process for that. I usually pull the top three takeaways and use some of the content from that, and then lead people to the full post or ask them to join the email list or watch the YouTube video, whatever. So I have a repeatable process for that. So every time I sit down to repurpose, I'm not reinventing the wheel. I have a way that I look at the content that I take pieces out, and then I'm able to publish things. So having your own process, there is no one perfect process for this, but having your own process makes it something not only that you can do without thinking about it, but that later on you could actually outsource, you could get support from a VA (virtual assistant) or whatever to do that for you.

[00:13:43.850] - Sarah Jane Burt
Another suggestion is to use a tool like Quuu Promote to get your posts in front of new people. So Quuu is a tool that helps you curate content. So a lot of social media managers will use curated content as part of their strategy so that they're not constantly having to create new content. They might share a helpful article. That's like part of their ongoing process. So Quuu is a tool that helps people find curated content that they can share on their channels. Quuu Promote is like the other side of that. There is a cost to it. It is a subscription-based thing. But basically, you put your blog post on there, and then the people that are curating content will see your blog post and be able to share that on their social. I will say I've only used this for myself, so I'm not sure that it works for every niche, but it's worth looking into. It's a pretty cool tool, especially for any people that their audience is small business owners or people in marketing. This is a pretty cool tool to use. If you're in a different niche, let's say you're super, super niche, you only talk about growing trees, you might not find your people on Quuu Promote. It's worth looking into, though, see what's on Quuu, and then that will give you an idea, which I think Quuu is free to use. That will give you an idea of whether or not that might be worthwhile to you.

[00:15:29.640] - Sarah Jane Burt
Share in communities. So this is the second strategy. And what I mean by communities, any place that people are gathering on the internet, I think that this is a really underutilized resource for sharing blog content, for getting the word out about your blog. So we're looking at forums like Quora and Reddit, Facebook communities, Slack groups, other community platforms like Circle, where people are gathering online to talk about a specific thing. These communities are full of people asking questions about your topic. They need support, they have questions, they want to know what's going on, they want suggestions, whatever. Then these might be things that you've already answered in a blog post somewhere. So what's great about this is they're raising their hands. They're saying, I want this information. I need this information. I'm interested in the topic. I need support. You're not having to go and find them somewhere. They're all concentrated in this one place where you can engage and share your information.

[00:16:41.360] - Sarah Jane Burt
So how do you get started with this? There are a bajillion groups out there, but I think the best place to start is to survey your audience. And this survey that you do, I would do it periodically, maybe once a year, is going to give you more than just information about what communities your people are in. You're also going to find out what are they interested in. You might find that something that you thought was really important is not important to them, or something that you never thought to write about is something they're very interested in. So survey your audience and how to survey three to five questions tops. Most people will not answer more than that. Some of these could be multiple choice, could be open ended. It just depends on the question that you're asking. So you want to find out where are they getting their information from? So what publications are they reading? This is going to help you with things like guest blogging and collaborating with other people. Find out what they're reading, where they get their information. What other blogs are they reading on the same topic? What communities do they belong to? Likely you'll find some communities that you've never heard of, because, for instance, I'm part of a few different Slack groups for marketers. These are things that I just randomly found out about. Somebody told me about it. I saw an ad for it. They're not just like everyone knows about them. They're just Slack groups that I found out about randomly, and that might be the same for you. You might find that your people are hanging out in these places that you never thought to look. So this is also your opportunity to ask any questions that are really going to help you better understand your audience and be able to build a bigger audience. But think carefully about what three to five questions you pick, because again, if you ask too many questions, people might not fill out the whole thing. The way to get buy-in for this, the best way to get buy-in for this, I've done this every time I've run a survey and I've gotten enough answers, is to enter everyone who participates into a drawing for a prize. Now, that prize can be anything from a free product. So a product that you sell, maybe you give it to them for free. Maybe it's a consultation with you. But it can also just be like a $5 Starbucks gift card. Just think of something that they would want that would entice them to actually go through with the survey. So this is going to cost you a little bit of money. But again, it's something you do once a year, and it's really going to give you a lot of data, not just for promotional strategies, but just in general.

[00:19:38.410] - Sarah Jane Burt
Tips for making this work. Take that data that you get from the survey and join some of those communities. Before you participate, before you start answering questions, just observe. What's going on? What are people talking about? What's the etiquette for participating in the group? There are a lot of groups, a lot of subreddits, a lot of Facebook groups where you cannot promote, you can't promote your own stuff. In that case, you might answer a question and say, I have a blog post about this. If you want to read it, just let me know, DM me, whatever. So you might not be able to post your link, but you can still open up a conversation. So join the group, figure out what the etiquette is. And then once you do start adding to the conversation, make sure that you're adding value. You're not just spamming with links or CTAs. People will tend to ignore that. Even if the post you wrote is the best post ever written on this topic, so insightful, so beautiful, they're going to love it. They don't know that from you just posting the link, so make sure that you add some value. If you are allowed to post links, make sure that you tie that link to your blog. You tie that blog to the question that you're answering. So for instance, let's say you wrote a blog post on the best computers for teenagers, the best laptops for teenagers. And someone asked, I want to get my teen a new laptop. I'm thinking a Mac, but I'm not quite sure, whatever. You answer the question, you can say, yeah, a Mac is great for these reasons, but there are also more affordable laptops that you can buy your teen. I actually wrote a blog post on this that goes into a lot more detail if you want to read it, and then post the link. Just make sure there's a connection. It's not just some random thing that you're spamming people with.

[00:21:42.790] - Sarah Jane Burt
Guest blogging is our third strategy. This might be something you're already doing, but I do have a few pro tips if this is something you're already doing. Guest blogging you're posting is a great way to use someone else's audience to get in front of new people. And the best part about guest blogging and also collaborations, which is, surprise, our fourth strategy, is that it's a win-win. So the blog host owner is getting really great content to put on their blog. You are getting the opportunity to get in front of a new audience.

[00:22:25.890] - Sarah Jane Burt
How to get started? So the first thing you need to do is find blogs that you can submit your guest post to. So just a few parameters for this should have a similar audience or an overlapping audience. So it doesn't necessarily have to be a blog that's just like yours. Let's say that you are a gardening blog, and this blog is about maybe growing vegetables specifically. That audience overlaps with the general... Or let's say it's the other way around. You write about vegetables. This is a general gardening publication. There's going to be people that are interested in vegetables in there, so you have an overlapping audience. It may not be everyone in their audiences for you, but there's some people in there that are. And they need to accept guest blog posts. So a lot of blogs that regularly accept guest posts will have a page on their blog that says how to submit a guest post, all the parameters, the rules. Some may not, but you might see that they have guest posts on there, or you might reach out. Maybe they've never considered having a guest post. You might reach out and ask if they're open to it. But obviously do that work first before you start pitching, because if they're not even open to guest blog post, you're wasting your time there.

[00:23:50.830] - Sarah Jane Burt
You want to find blogs that have an audience that's bigger than yours, but not so big right off the bat. So if the only place you've ever written is in your blog, and you've got 15 blog posts in there, you're not going to go pitch Forbes, right? Because they're looking for people that have a history of publishing in publications with lots and lots of readers. So you want to find a blog that it's likely they'll say yes based on your publication experience. But let's say maybe you have published in some bigger publications, then you can go for those bigger publications. But you really want to just focus on where your audience is, where you're likely to get in, what fits with the content you talk about and the content that's on their blog. I think a great place to start is with your favorite blogs and publications. You also will find that out in the survey, so you can use that information. Again, that's a great place to start. Look at the things that you already like and know. It's easier to pitch to a place that you know than a brand new place.

[00:25:11.260] - Sarah Jane Burt
So, some tips. This can be super time-consuming strategy because you can be writing pitches all day. It's also a bit of a numbers game. Just statistically, you might pitch to 10 places and only get accepted to one. So consider that when you're picking which publications to pitch you, don't waste your time pitching the ones that might not be a good fit.

[00:25:38.770] - Sarah Jane Burt
Read the blog. Actually, read the blog or publication to get a feel for the style of the content and the types of topics. Your pitch is going to be way better for it. If you understand what people have written about, you understand what content does well on the blog, you'll be able to pitch, make a better pitch.

[00:25:59.300] - Sarah Jane Burt
Follow their submission guidelines. Some blogs have really not complicated, but a long list of things that you have to keep in mind, like you're only allowed to use two links to your own content. You can't talk about a topic that's already been talked about. They don't want how-to content or they only want how-to content. Look at that stuff before you come up with pitch ideas.

[00:26:25.300] - Sarah Jane Burt
In your pitch, take time to show them how it's going to add value for their readers. So if they have a bigger audience than you, you need them more than they need you. So really talk about how it's going to add value for their readers, not necessarily how great you are, although that's a piece of the pitch as well. Here's a pro tip. If you can offer an SEO angle, this often makes it easier to get the guest post. Everyone's concerned with SEO, so you can write a post that will bring traffic to their page. They're more likely to say yes. So how do you do this? Look at the posts that have been made, look for common themes, think about those subtopics that have been posted about, and think about what is missing here. Where are the gaps? Then once you get those topics, you can do keyword research and say, okay, there's this many people look up this keyword. There's definitely traffic potential here - "I want to write a blog post around this keyword, here's my suggestion'".

[00:27:34.020] - Sarah Jane Burt
Okay, the fourth and final strategy, collaboration. So collaborating with others in your niche who already have an audience is a great way to get in front of new people, get new people into your world. This can look any way you want it to. There's not one right way to collaborate, which is what I love about collaborations. You can partner with a micro influencer. You can hold a joint webinar. You can get interviewed on a podcast. There are a bunch of different ways that you can work with others to build your audience and help them build theirs.

[00:28:08.060] - Sarah Jane Burt
So first step is to find the people that you want to collaborate with. They don't have to be influencers. They can be other bloggers. They can be people who blog about adjacent things. They can be other business owners. A good place to start is within your own network. So do you have a friend in an adjacent industry? Or maybe you have a colleague that you just really love talking about something with and they want to collaborate someone who has a podcast, anyone that you already know that you think would be a great collaboration opportunity, that's a great place to start.

[00:28:43.830] - Sarah Jane Burt
Tips, build a relationship with the person before you ask them for a favor. Don't randomly email people and say, "Hey, you want to collaborate..", and they don't even know who you are. They're more likely to work with you if they know and trust you, just like your audience is more likely to buy from you when they know and trust you. One good way to collaborate without collaborating is to interview subject matter experts, include the quotes from the interview in your blog posts. They will likely share the link to the blog post once it comes out if they're featured in the blog post. So consider that that's an easy way to collaborate, an easy yes for people. They don't have to do any work other than do the interview. And then come to the conversation with an idea of how you might potentially collaborate. Don't make the other person do the work, say, here's a great collaboration opportunity. Let's do it. The more specific you can get there, the better. So I want to do a newsletter swap. Here's what that will look like, et cetera.

[00:29:56.310] - Sarah Jane Burt
So action steps. Pick one of these strategies to focus on first, just one. Take the first step toward making it happen, so that how to get started? Take that first step. Do the work to make it work before you move on to something else.

[00:30:10.590] - Sarah Jane Burt
Any questions you have, you can ask? Now I'm happy to answer them.

[00:30:18.570] - Sarah Jane Burt
And before we go, I have a free guide for you that has all of my tips, tools, and tech for promoting your content. Totally free to you. It's something that I might eventually sell in my shop, but for now it's free, and I made it just for you. These are advanced tips for the strategies that we talked about today, some additional strategies I didn't have time to get into, so just a deeper dive into these, some info about my processes or how I save time doing these strategies, how I have made a repeatable process, also the tech tools I use. So I know a lot of people might have questions about what tools, what software can I use to help with the promotion aspect? All of that is inside here. So it just dives a little deeper, gives you a little more information to get this. This is an example page, but to get this, you just click on that button, and yeah, it'll take you to the magical link.

[00:31:20.590] - Sarah Jane Burt
So thank you for coming to my presentation. I hope that you took away something that you can apply to promoting your blog post.
