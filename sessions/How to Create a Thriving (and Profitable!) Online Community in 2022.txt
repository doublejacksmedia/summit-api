[00:00:13.430] - Ryan
Hi, everyone. I'm Ryan from the Podia team. And I'll be walking you through my presentation on how to create a thriving and profitable online community in 2022. So, little background about me first, I am a growth marketer here at Podia. And I've worked with thousands of different creators in all kinds of niche, from bloggers to people selling courses, running their online communities. I've worked with our affiliates. I run our weekly demos along with new product demos, and I'm always talking to our creators.

[00:00:49.490] - Ryan
I love to do customer interviews and see what are the hot topics. And that's how I've learned that community is one of the most important pieces of your online business coming into next year. So, I'm really excited to share what I know about community and how you can apply it to your own business. Just one thing before we jump in, I will ask you to close those other browser tabs. Put your phone on mute.

[00:01:12.830] - Ryan
It's only going to be maybe 30 minutes. So, if you can just give me your undivided attention for that, it will really help you grow your own online community. So, I want to just give a brief overview of the types of things you're going to learn today. So, first, I want to talk about how you as a creator can attract people into your community. The first thing we need to do is give you some tips on how you can start building your online community.

[00:01:37.930] - Ryan
Maybe you have a little Facebook group, or maybe you've never even thought about that, you're just focused on blogging. But what we want to do is give you some just beginner tips that you can use to begin growing your online community today. Next, once you begin growing your community, the next big challenge creators face is keeping people in the community. You got to keep it active.

[00:01:58.630] - Ryan
You got to keep it engaged. You got to keep people wanting to come back for more. So, I'll be giving you some tips on how much you get people in your community. You can keep them there. And finally, the best part of any community is engaging with your audience but also making some extra money from it.

[00:02:14.620] - Ryan
And what's really good about an online community is once it gets running, then it's almost on autopilot. You can just keep it going. But you can start charging either to make that monthly recurring revenue to maintain access to your community, or is a perfect pipeline to start selling your own products directly into your community. So, with that being said, I hope everyone is as excited as I am. So, let's jump in.

[00:02:38.440] - Ryan
So, the first most important part of building any new community is picking the right niche for your community. Now, this isn't to say that you want to get hyper niche focused. A lot of people, now, when they're building websites or something, so, you want to be as niche as possible.

[00:02:55.310] - Ryan
That doesn't really apply to the community model. You want something that does have some broader appeal that will bring in the type of audience member you want, but you don't want it too broad. You don't want it too narrow. So I call it the Goldilocks rule. Not too hard, not too soft, but you want it just right.

[00:03:13.910] - Ryan
So think of your niche, what you're blogging about. So, if you are a travel blogger, maybe you don't want just a travel community that's too broad. But you don't also just want a Los Angeles community that's too narrow. You want something in the middle that really speaks to your audience and what you're trying to generate. So, if you're a women's travel blogger, running a women's travel group would be perfect.

[00:03:38.350] - Ryan
Maybe you're a chef and you teach people about cooking. Just a cooking community again, too broad. But if it's how to use one specific type of knife, that's probably too specific, something between maybe budget cooking, something that will appeal or growing your own food, something that is in your broader niche, but also a little more targeted to get that right person in there. So, think of your niche, apply it to what makes sense for you and try to find something maybe a bit broader, but right in that middle ground to attract more people into your community in the first place.

[00:04:14.610] - Ryan
Once you identify that niche, you really want to come up with a hook to get people into your community by offering them some exclusive benefits.

[00:04:22.870] - Ryan
So you're probably familiar with the idea of lead magnets to get people on your email list, maybe offering a freebie or something like that to get people to sign up. It's the same idea when growing your community, you really want to offer some exclusive benefit to give people that push to sign up to get them in there. Once they're in there, hopefully, they'll stay by seeing the value. But you do need that hook to get people in. So some ideas that you can use as that hook to get people into your community, you can offer a digital download.

[00:04:52.900] - Ryan
These can be really easy to set up, and you can even leverage your existing lead magnet. So, if you're using things to get people on your email list, you can just repurpose that and put that in your community as an incentive for people to sign up there. You can offer, if you have an old course, you can put that course in there, maybe a webinar that you've done, maybe a webinar you're going to do or product discount. You can say once you sign up to my community, I'll give you an exclusive community member 10% discount code.

[00:05:22.010] - Ryan
Whatever it is, think about what you're probably already offering your audience to get them to sign up to a place like your email list and just repackage that, make that an inclusive benefit in your community. And then you can easily add that. And people can download or access whatever that benefit is when they sign up. And finally, once you've identified your niche, you've come up with a great sort of opt in incentive. Then you need to promote your community and tell people about it.

[00:05:47.960] - Ryan
So, again, this isn't going to be wildly different than anything you're currently doing. So, put it on your blog, have it in your sidebar, make it prominent, include it in your email list. What I would do is, when you're first announcing it, I would have a little build up, say something's coming, then have a dedicated email announcing the community and then going forward in the footer of every email you send, I would have a little blurb just about you. And oh, have you joined my free community and get access to whatever that opt in benefit is?

[00:06:19.490] - Ryan
So, make it part of your ongoing marketing strategy.

[00:06:22.620] - Ryan
Put on your social media. Again, leverage those incentives and put them in there. And then also one other tactic that I really like to use. It's not for everyone, but it does tie into the monetization piece later is you can tease it as say, oh, right now I'm growing my community. It's free, but one day I might charge. But if you're in there, you'll be able to keep free access or say, oh, it's free, but only for the first 1000 members or whatever number you decide.

[00:06:49.000] - Ryan
That can be a great way to leverage your existing audience. Get them excited to sign up and start building those numbers. Because once that momentum begins to build, then we can start focusing on some of the other important pieces. So, one question I'd like to put to you right now is, what niche makes sense for your community. Remember, you want something that's broadly related to your niche, but not too broad.

[00:07:11.080] - Ryan
So, think of something in that range. Maybe look at your blog, what you're talking about and find that kind of broader category related to your niche. That makes sense that people will want to chat about and really will bring in the right type of audience for you. So, the next thing you do is after you start building that community, people are coming in for you. You're building that excitement, you're getting them in there.

[00:07:34.850] - Ryan
Now you need to engage them. You really want to keep them in there. And so, we don't want this to be a very manual process on you. People will join the community for you and the benefits you're offering them as a creator. But they'll stay for the engagement and the conversations they're having with each other.

[00:07:52.000] - Ryan
So, we really need to find a way to make that long term community active and engaged. So, really, I've identified three key pieces to a great community and that's activity, organization and connections. So, I'm going to dive into each of those next. First, as everyone knows, the most important part of any community is activity. If you join a community, and there's no post for a month.

[00:08:17.820] - Ryan
You're going to forget about it. You're going to leave. You're not going to care. You need that activity regularly going to keep people excited and engaged and looking forward to going and engaging in your community. So, as you're growing your community in the very beginning, it's going to be on you to spark this engagement, to get those conversations going.

[00:08:37.700] - Ryan
So what I would recommend, I would make a weekly plan of things that you're going to do in your community to spark that conversation. You don't want this to be just like your blog where you're the one posting people are consuming. You want to get people engaged, you want to get them talking. So, some ideas. And again, this depends on your niche and what works best for you.

[00:08:57.370] - Ryan
But some things that I've seen work really well in our creator communities are sharing relevant industry news. That's something you can go. Just find two or three blog posts around the internet or on your own site and post them. And maybe something that's a little controversial. Maybe something that people haven't thought about, just anything that can kind of get that conversation going is great.

[00:09:17.980] - Ryan
You can also pose a question of the week, so you can just come up with a relevant question, maybe something you came across or something you got emailed from someone in your audience again, just get that conversation going, provide your feedback. But also give a place for your audience to share their thoughts and their feedback as well. You can also allow member promotion days. So, a tricky balance with communities is you don't want people joining and just like spamming links to their own websites and promoting their optin freebies.

[00:09:47.810] - Ryan
Then it becomes a mess.

[00:09:48.920] - Ryan
But your members really do like to do that. And in the smaller engaged communities, they really do like to support each other. So, to find a happy middle ground, I recommend having member promotion days. So, you might say, hey, there's no self promotion allowed, except on Fridays. And then on Fridays, you can post your latest blog posts.

[00:10:07.710] - Ryan
You can see what other people in the community have been working on. That can be a really good way to have people engaged because they know, oh. Every Friday, I can go in, I can share my posts, maybe get some comments, maybe I can highlight that new Instagram post. I just did whatever it is you want to give your audience a place where they feel like it's okay for them to promote themselves, but they shouldn't be doing it all the time. So that's a really good balance that I found is identifying one member promotion day. And also just keep adding exclusive content to your community.

[00:10:40.030] - Ryan
Whether that is running just a once a month webinar, you'll get in and you'll teach something for 30 minutes.

[00:10:45.540] - Ryan
It doesn't need to be long or a new digital download template or early access to your new course. Whatever it is, just try to think of ways to make your community members feel like they're your VIPs. They're there, they're engaged. So, treat them right and give them some exclusive access, which will lead to higher activity and engagement. The next big thing with any community is you've got to keep it organized as your community grows.

[00:11:12.720] - Ryan
And if you're following these tips, hopefully you'll see it grow from the dozens to the hundreds to the thousands. But what happens when you have so many people is conversations can get buried, especially if people are talking about different topics, and then there's replies and it can just become a mess. So, I highly recommend keeping your community organized from the beginning. This might seem like overkill, especially if you don't have a community yet or you're just starting to grow it. But if you can lay the groundwork early for a nice organized community, it'll really pay the dividends later.

[00:11:47.800] - Ryan
So, to do this, I recommend coming up with maybe five to ten non overlapping topics related to your general community. So, for example, if our general community is budget cooking, you might have one topic that's recipes. So, any conversation about recipes goes on that topic. You might have one conversation about your favorite other bloggers. You might have a conversation about cooking tips like whatever it is, you want to find different ways that you can break down the community into digestible topics.

[00:12:23.430] - Ryan
That way people can go and they can say, oh, I'm just interested in looking at the new recipes. Let me go to that recipes topic, or oh, I really want to buy a kitchen knife, but I don't know which one to get. Then you can go into the cooking equipment topic or whatever you decide. So, it's worth spending a little bit of time to map out your community. And you don't want those topics to overlap because you want to know if I'm going to recipes, I'll find the recipes or if I'm going to cooking equipment, I'll find that.

[00:12:50.760] - Ryan
So, try to think of five to ten logical, non overlapping topics related to your broader niche that you can subdivide the community into. And this will just make it so much easier to manage later on as your community grows. Finally, the main thing that's going to keep people in your community is their connections with you, but also with each other. So, you really want to start to organically grow your community members chatting with each other. So, just a couple of ways you can do this is when someone joins, you can just ask new members to create an introduction post. And maybe that's weekly or every day, whatever it is, ask your new members, welcome them, and then have them share.

[00:13:34.330] - Ryan
Maybe just a couple of basic things, but also something fun about themselves that can start a conversation. So, maybe where are you from? What's your name and what's one thing that most people wouldn't know about you. Whatever it is, you just want them to feel like they're growing part of your real community. And so, sharing something personal that can get some fun stories going get other members to welcome them.

[00:13:56.200] - Ryan
You really want to build that connection with the other community members, so people feel really involved and that they want to stay. Another great way to do this is each week you can send out either an email recap or in your community itself, highlighting some of the interesting conversations that have happened. So, you can say, oh, Rachel posted this thread about her favorite cooking knives, or Jim posted this one about his itinerary to Australia. Whatever it is, you just want to highlight some good conversations, especially if they got good engagement with each other because more members will want to contribute and then they will hopefully get featured the next week.

[00:14:34.570] - Ryan
So, it really builds on itself, gives you a reason to email your list or post about it at the top of the community.

[00:14:40.630] - Ryan
That way people feel involved, they feel seen and they really feel like they're part of something. One other idea that I've seen work, well, in some communities is randomly matching community members with each other for a 30 minutes Zoom call or just to connect one on one over chat. Whatever it is, it just really builds this way of people getting to know each other. You don't necessarily want to force people into it, but if people optionally want to join a topic, it can be called buddies or connections.

[00:15:08.730] - Ryan
You can have a topic, and then if people are in there, you know, they're hoping to meet other people.

[00:15:13.490] - Ryan
So then once a week or once a month, whatever you decide, you can randomly match members together and then they can have their own conversations. And again, that's organically building those connections without you being directly involved. Do you want to be the one who's kind of overseeing things, keeping people on track? But you really want to start building those one to one connections among your community members. You don't want to completely rely on you.

[00:15:39.080] - Ryan
You want them to feel connected to each other. That's what will get that engagement. That's what will get people to stay. So, another question to pose is how would you divide your community into, say, five to ten non overlapping topics? So, just give a thought to your niche, your Goldilocks niche for your community.

[00:15:58.580] - Ryan
How can you divide that into maybe five to ten topics? You don't have to do this right now, but just spend some time over the next couple of days and map out five to ten topics that you think could work really well for your community to keep it organized. So, we've now attracted people in our community. We're growing it and engagements going up. We're keeping people there.

[00:16:20.110] - Ryan
They're excited. How can we now make money from this? You don't want to just be running it as a time intensive thing that's not really benefiting your business. So, the third step is monetizing your community, and we've seen with our creators that a community is one of the most valuable business assets you can have. Because a, you own it. This is your community and the people look up to you.

[00:16:44.880] - Ryan
So, when you get going, it gives you a lot of marketing power and the ability to sell your audience because this is probably your most valuable audience. Your email list is obviously important, but in the community, people will feel even more connected to you because they're engaging with you much more regularly. So, let's look at a couple of different ways you Canva monetize your community. So, the first way to find new product ideas or content to create is to look for common challenges that your community members are posting about.

[00:17:16.690] - Ryan
You don't need to go and try to brainstorm, oh, should I write this blog post, or should I create this online course or this digital download?

[00:17:24.530] - Ryan
Your community will do the work for you. As your community grows, you're going to start to see the same questions being asked over and over, whether it's on a certain topic or how to do one certain thing or whatever it is, you're going to start to see a pattern of members in your community asking the same questions. This should be a big flashing red light to you that that is a challenge common in your niche that you should go solve. So, whatever it is, you want to go and say, oh, I've seen the same question over and over.

[00:17:58.700] - Ryan
That's something that both people in my community are struggling with, which means people outside of my community are struggling with, too.

[00:18:05.220] - Ryan
So, you want to identify those common problems and go and create the solution that can be a blog post that can be a digital product that you sell. Whatever it is, it can be a webinar, whatever it is, you want to create the solutions to the problems that you're seeing. And then you'll be able to sell those and make some extra money. So, I just mentioned the digital products. So, once you identify those challenges that you're seeing over and over, you want to go create digital products around that, and these can range wildly in price.

[00:18:36.470] - Ryan
So, on the cheaper end, a lot of times people will say, oh, I don't know how to outline a blog post or I don't know how to plan a trip.

[00:18:45.070] - Ryan
I just don't know what to pack. Whatever it is, you can go either on the cheaper and typically the cheaper products that you can sell are also the faster ones to create. So, I've listed a couple of examples here, but kind of on the cheaper and easier to create. Those would be your templates or your ebooks, so it could just be a $10 downloadable PDF that is, here's your perfect packing guide, or here's the best kitchen knives for 2022. Whatever it is, look at the challenges that your community members are facing and make a quick digestible digital download or a template that they can use to answer that.

[00:19:24.210] - Ryan
As you get into more complicated questions, you might want to think about creating an online course around it. An online course doesn't need to be some massive 200 video, 20 hours thing. It can be a one to two hour video course. That's completely fine. So, if there's something a little more complicated that you can't solve with the template or an ebook, now you can just make an online course.

[00:19:45.950] - Ryan
You can easily film things, record your slides, however you want, and you can sell that course. And those courses tend to command a higher price than a lot of the cheaper downloadable templates and ebooks. So ,by making that course, you can sell a $97 course in 1 hour that will solve whatever that challenge that you're seeing, your community is. And from there, if you really want to take it up, you can start offering coaching or mastermind session. So, these are your high ticket offers kind of on the other end of the spectrum for people that want that one to one attention with you or want to be part of a monthly coaching group.

[00:20:22.740] - Ryan
That's where you work in your group coaching program. So, you have a wide range of things to pick. But I would recommend starting with maybe the cheaper options, the templates, the ebooks, the digital downloads, see how those do see people are buying them. And if they are, then you can progress to a course, and finally, to a coaching or a mastermind program. The other way that I really love to have creators monetize communities is by offering an ongoing subscription plan.

[00:20:50.160] - Ryan
So, I said at the beginning you might want to offer community access for free, but one day you might want to turn that paid. So, one of the best things you can do is run a paid community. So, people instead of just joining and engaging and chatting for free, eventually you want those people to pay, so they might pay even if it's only five or $10 a month. If you get your community to 100 people or 1000 people. If you're charging even $5 a month for 1000 person community, that's an extra $5,000 a month in your pocket without really any extra work.

[00:21:22.970] - Ryan
And actually, this is just a very valuable audience for the rest of your business. So, charging subscription plans is really a powerful way. And again, I love to grow communities by first offering them free, but hinting that this might go paid one day. So, you probably want to get grandfathered in now while it's free, and then if it goes paid, then you'll benefit from that. Or another thing that we've seen work really well here at Podia is you can offer different tiers of membership plans. So, you can keep a free one or you can offer, say, a $10 month plan that includes access to a private topic just for members, or that can go all the way up.

[00:22:02.530] - Ryan
You can offer $200 a month plans that include live group coaching and webinars, or you can offer a $50 a month plan that includes access to some of your digital products in your courses.

[00:22:13.980] - Ryan
It's completely up to you, but having that flexibility to set different tiers of membership plans is a great way to grow your business and give you that consistent monthly revenue without you having to constantly turn out new products. You just got to keep your community active and engaged. And if you followed these tips, you'll have an active and engaged community that people will happily pay 5 or $10 a month at the beginning just to stay a part of. So, getting those monthly subscription plans into your community is one of the best ways you can monetize, and it ties together with everything that you're already creating.

[00:22:49.890] - Ryan
So, I've thrown a lot of information to you on how you can get started with growing your community, keeping it active and then monetizing it. So, let me break it down real quick into some of these action steps. So, first, I want you to go away and picture Goldilocks topic related to your general niche, which is not too broad but not too narrow. So, find something in the middle, something that is maybe like budget travel or budget cooking or jazz music. Something that relates to the bigger topic makes it a little more specific, but not too narrow.

[00:23:23.370] - Ryan
So, once you've done that, brainstorm some of your content that you can use as an absence to join. And again, no need to reinvent the wheel here. You can use your existing lead magnets that you're using for your email list or for other purposes. You can use that and say, when you sign up to my community, you'll get this free bonus, whatever it is. Then map out your weekly content plan.

[00:23:45.710] - Ryan
Whether that's various industry news you're going to post, questions you're going to ask, things you're going to highlight, whatever it is. It makes it a lot easier if you follow a consistent format each week makes it predictable for you and your audience. That on certain days certain things will happen whether that's a question or a member share day, whatever it is. Just map out your schedule and then it'll be very easy to follow going forward. Next, divide your community into those five to ten non overlapping topics.

[00:24:14.970] - Ryan
This might not seem something really important now, but as your community grows, it will be so beneficial having things nice and organized from the get go. It'll keep it tidy. Conversations won't get buried, which in turn will increase engagement. So, having those topics identified really will help you grow your community. As your community grows, I want you to keep a list of common questions you're seeing asked in your community. This is a goldmine of information for you.

[00:24:42.710] - Ryan
As a creator, it'll tell you what blog posts you should go create what digital products you should make? How you can monetize is by solving these challenges, and your audience will be telling you almost every day what they're struggling with. So, that is just such valuable information for you. As a creator, you can go solve those challenges with your products with your blog posts, and then you'll benefit from that.

[00:25:06.880] - Ryan
And eventually, the long goal here is you want to turn your community into those paid monthly subscriptions. You can sell your one off products, of course, but I love seeing creators get that consistent monthly revenue from running their community. It builds that audience builds a relationship, and you don't need to charge a lot. You can charge 5 to $10 a month just to keep access to your community. And you're getting this great, warm audience of people who really like you like your content, and then they're going to be more likely to buy your higher price products if you decide to sell them in the future.

[00:25:39.040] - Ryan
So, those are my action steps. It's a lot of information, but you can pause the video here, write these down. You can go through the slides and just really map it out. So, the next logical question a lot of people ask us. Okay, Ryan, this sounds great.

[00:25:52.310] - Ryan
How do I choose a community platform? So, there's a few key things that I want you to think about when you're deciding where to run your online community. First, I keep talking about these monthly subscription plans. You really want a platform that allows you to easily set and run monthly subscription plans, especially something with different tiers. You might want a free plan and keep that forever. That's fine.

[00:26:15.900] - Ryan
But then you might want a 5 to $10 a month or $50 a month or $100 a month. You want that option to offer different levels of plans, because that means it can grow as your community grows, and you can make more money. Similar to that is you need the ability to take payments for your products that includes both your one off digital products. If you do want to sell those ebooks or the templates, or an online course, or all the way up to easily charging monthly for your community. You don't want to be mainly trying to keep track of PayPal how this goes there, and I need to send this.

[00:26:51.480] - Ryan
You want a platform that can manage that for you.

[00:26:54.290] - Ryan
Also related to all this is, it's essential that you have a platform where you can run your community and sell those products in the same place. You don't want people logging into one platform, then you're selling a product and they have to go somewhere else to access it, and then they have to go back to chat about it. It's so much smoother and easier if you can run your community and sell your products all in one place. And finally, you want to own your audience.

[00:27:19.250] - Ryan
You don't want them hidden behind some algorithm and not have access to their email address. You want to be able to email your customers, get in front of them when you want to. So, probably see where I'm going with this. But Facebook groups fail all four of these. You can't easily do monthly subscriptions. You can't easily take payments for your products.

You definitely can't run your community and sell your products in the same place, and you don't own your audience. Facebook is notorious for hiding audience information. You don't get their email address automatically. So, my solution, of course, is Podia. We talk to creators, and we've heard over and over those four key criteria in a community platform. And we weren't really able to find one that sold all four of those in one place.

So, we built it. With Podia, you can have your online community all in one place, you have the organized topics you've got the chat. But also we're a digital product platform so you can sell unlimited courses and digital downloads all for one price. You can set different membership tiers and we don't charge transaction fees. So, it really has been built from the ground up to be the perfect community platform for creators for one monthly fee, starting at just $39 a month.

You can have access to a community and sell unlimited digital products. So, if you just want to test your digital downloads alongside your community, go for it. We offer a 14 day free trial at Podia.com. You don't need a code or anything.

You can just go to Podia.com. You can click this button that should be popping up right about now, and that will take you to the Podia.Com website and sign up for a free trial. And you don't have to use Podia. There's other platforms out there, too. But I personally know that after talking to creators, we really wanted to build something that solves all those issues and helps you run a profitable community.

So, we would love to show you Podia. But if it's not Podia, I still highly recommend finding a platform where you can run your community in the same place that you sell your digital products and grow that community. So, any questions? Please put them in the chat box below. Thanks so much.
