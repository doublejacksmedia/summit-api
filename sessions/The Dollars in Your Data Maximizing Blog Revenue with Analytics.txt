Hey there. I'm Sherry Smotherman-Short from Painless Blog Analytics. And I want to start by telling Liz a big thank you for inviting me to join your Blogger Breakthrough Summit again this year. Liz, thank you so much. Now, if we've not met, let me tell you a little bit about myself. I've been blogging at Cub Scout Ideas for over a decade now. And before that, I worked for an auto insurance company. And while I was there, I wasn't on the analysis side of things. I didn't do anything with data, but I did hang out with a lot of people who were and worked with a lot of them on lots of different projects. I feel like it rubbed off on me a little bit. When I started my blog, Cub Scout Ideas in, I think it was 2012, I found out that I could get information for free from Google Analytics that told me what was going on with my blog. I started digging into that and figuring out ways that I could apply what I saw to help me grow my traffic so that I could get to the point where my blog made money for me.

[00:01:09.550] - Sherry Smothermon-Short
As the years went by, I met lots of other bloggers, including some that were substantially larger blogs than mine. I would talk to them about Google Analytics. And what I found out was that a lot of people didn't even look at their analytics. And if they did, it was a quick let me jump in, grab a number or two and jump out because I just can't handle all those numbers. I don't know what they mean. They don't make sense to me. Because of that, and I was thinking, Man, these folks are very successful and they're not really using those analytics. That's when I decided to start Painless Blog Analytics. Now, what I do at Painless Blog Analytics is I help experienced bloggers use their data to grow and improve their blogs. Today, we're going to learn about the dollars in your data, maximizing your blog revenue using your analytics. What we'll do is I'm going to walk you through some things in Google Analytics for showing you where things are and all that. Then I'm going to explain what some of the data means, and then I'm going to give you some ideas of ways that you can use that data to improve your blogs.

[00:02:16.800] - Sherry Smothermon-Short
Let's go ahead and get started. Let me minimize myself. I'm going to be using my Cubs Scout ideas, Google Analytics 4 account. First, we're going to look at your blog posts that have the most traffic. I'm going to tell you a little bit about some of the things that you can do there. We're going to go to Reports. And when you're here, you guys won't have blogging reports because that's something that I created myself. But you may have either business objectives or life cycle. These are called collections. Now, within each of the collections, you're going to have topics. We've got generate leads, we've got acquisition. And then within each of those, you're going to see reports. So collections, topics, reports. You may have both of these collections or you may have one or the other. These are generic collections that Google created for us. What we're looking for here is we are looking for your Pages and screens report. And you can find that report in both of these menus. These are just menus over here. If I look under business objectives, it is going to be in the raise brand awareness topic pages and screens, or if I look in lifecycle, it's going to be in engagement pages and screens.

[00:03:37.860] - Sherry Smothermon-Short
And both of those are going to take us to the exact same report. I am not a big fan of these charts and graphs up here. They only talk about your top five blog posts. And to me, that's just not valuable information to having a chart. I'm going to just scroll past that. Let me move myself over here. And then what I'm going to do here is right now I can see my top 10 blog posts. I want to change that to 25. That'll show us 25 rows here. Let's talk a little bit about what we're going to do here. We are going to go through these blog posts and we're going to think about what is the question or problem that this blog post answers are solved. In SEO, we call this search intent. Basically, we are going to try to figure out what the search intent was behind the search that got the people to this blog post. I'm going to start with my very top blog post here. It is that my Cub Scout uniform patch placement post. It's basically, we're on the little kid's uniform do you put these patches? And that has been my number one post for quite some time now.

[00:04:51.080] - Sherry Smothermon-Short
And I want us to stop and think, why would somebody be looking for this? Why would somebody wind up on this blog post? Well, it's because they don't know where to put the patches. If those Cubs Scout parents are like me, it's an hour before we have to leave to go to a meeting. And my kids come running in and saying, Mom, you never sewed these patches on and I want to wear them tonight. And so it's a frantic look for it. So my search intent was I need to know where to place these patches on the uniform. I've answered that question in this post, but now I want you to think about what's the next thing that my audience might ask or what's the next problem they might have once I've solved this problem for them? Think about that. What comes next? And for this, it's okay, now that I know where to put them, how do I sew them on? They're not the most easy things to sew on, and they are not iron on. When I realized that a few years ago, I wrote a blog post called How to Sew on your patches easily.

[00:05:48.700] - Sherry Smothermon-Short
These are companion blog posts. This is solving the next problem that they might have. And as you can see, it's in my top 10 now as well. When you're going through here and you're thinking about these things, I want you to think, What else can I help this person with that I could write a complementary blog post about? Because that's one of the ways that you can grow your traffic. You may just wind up having something show up in your top 10 like I did here. After you've gone down through here to figure out what other blog posts can I write that would be the next best step or the answer to the next question, I want you to look at the types of posts that you've written. I have several on here that are list posts. For example, this Cub Scout gifts is a list post. The Stocking Stuffers is a list post. 10 Knot Tying Games, 15 awesome Cub Scout leader gifts. I have quite a few list posts here. What other kinds of lists do I think my audience might be interested in? Think about that. Then think, are there other types of posts on here?

[00:06:52.260] - Sherry Smothermon-Short
Let's see. This first aid kits is an activity. They're going to make their own little first aid kit. This recycled or rain gutter regatta boat, they're actually making little boats out of recycled materials. That's an activity. Making the handmade hiking sticks is an activity. Making armpit fudge is an activity. My audience likes these kinds of activities. Again, think about what other kinds of activities can I give them. Those are the things that I would recommend that you do when you are looking at pages and screen to try to increase your traffic. What else can I give them? And give them that because you're going to find out that some of those are going to be very successful for you. Next, we are going to stay on this same page and we're going to add the secondary dimension of source medium. In Universal Analytics, it actually said secondary dimension. But here we just hit to click this plus sign and then we're going to search for source medium. I will tell you that there are three versions of source medium in GA4. We're only seeing two here. We're seeing first user and session source medium. There is also one that is just plain source medium.

[00:08:05.870] - Sherry Smothermon-Short
They are three very different measures. This first user is just like it sounds. It is the first time somebody comes to your site, this gets recorded. It does not take into account where people are coming from if they're coming back to your site. Now, the third one that's just plain source medium, you don't see on this list because it's not applicable here, but that is when there is some conversion on your site, usually something involving money. We're going to ignore that. The one that we want is the session source medium because it's the closest to what we had in Universal Analytics. Now we've got our source medium over here. What I want us to do is go down through, and maybe we don't do all 25, but we might want to do the top 10 blog posts this way. What I want you to do is filter down so that we just see this particular blog post. We're going to highlight it, copy it. And then here's a search bar here. We're going to paste it here. We're going to click Enter to search for it. Now we can see all of the different places that sent me traffic to this blog post here.

[00:09:13.640] - Sherry Smothermon-Short
What we're doing here is going to look at how much traffic we're getting from our top source, which in my case is Google. And then we're going to go down and say, Okay, let's look at something like email. I don't have a lot of traffic from emails to this blog post. Maybe it's because I'm not sharing this blog post in enough of my emails. Maybe I should even put it toward the bottom and just always have it in there. That might be something that I want to do, especially if this is a high RPM post. I might want to look and see, Okay, maybe I need to share this more often on Facebook because I'm only getting 75 visits. There's a few more because the way Google tracks these source mediums, they're not all exactly the same. We see that a lot, or more so with Pinterest than we do with Facebook, but we do see it with Facebook. But even if you add up the two or three Facebooks that I have here, it's still about 100. Same thing with Pinterest, maybe a little bit over 100 compared to 5,200. When I see that I'm getting very little traffic from these other sources compared to what I'm getting from Google, it tells me that something's not quite right with my strategy.

[00:10:22.020] - Sherry Smothermon-Short
Let's just take Pinterest, for instance. I need to dig into Pinterest and find out what's going on. Maybe it's been a really long time since I've pinned this post. Maybe I need to create a new pin with a different format, maybe different colors, different fonts, different wording. Maybe I need to do something like that. Or maybe I'd need to go into Pinterest and search for Cub Scout Uniform Patch Placement and see what comes up. If there are pins from other blogs that have similar posts, I need to examine those and just see how do their pins compare to mine. But I definitely need to dig into what's going on for this blog post with these other sources. Next, we need to talk about engagement rate. Let me explain what engagement rate is before we jump in to find an engagement rate on our reports. For a session to be considered engaged, one of three things needs to happen. Either the person needs to stay on your site 10 seconds or longer, or they need to visit two or more pages, or there needs to be some conversion event. Now, a lot of us don't sell anything, so there wouldn't be any monetary conversion, and we may not have other types of conversion set up.

[00:11:33.250] - Sherry Smothermon-Short
We're just going to focus on the first two: on staying on your site for 10 seconds or longer and on the visiting two or more pages. Another thing that you need to know about engagement rate is that bounce rate now is the inverse of engagement rate. Let's say I have 100 sessions and 75 of them are considered engaged because somebody stayed on the blog 10 seconds or longer or visited two or more page views. If 75 is my engagement rate, the percentage of the sessions that were engaged, my bounce rate is going to be 25 %. It's all the unengaged sessions, I guess you could say. Again, bounce rate is the inverse of engagement rate. Let's find our engagement rate. We're going to stay on this page that are pages and screens, but we're going to make a couple of changes. We're going to get rid of that search, and then we're going to get rid of our secondary dimension. What we need to do is to add our engagement rate. The way that we're going to do that is go here under Customize Report, then we are going to go to Metrics. Our engagement rate is a metric, so we're going to add the metric.

[00:12:45.300] - Sherry Smothermon-Short
And the way we do that is by clicking down here in the Add metric box. And we can just start typing engagement rate and then you'll see it pop up and we can select it. And then we're going to move this to the top. I'm just going to grab those six dots and drag it up here and drop it. Actually, we're going to make that engagement rate first. Then we're going to click Apply. And then we want to save this. I'm going to save this as a new report. I'm going to click Save. And then we can go back. Now that we've got engagement rate on here, we don't want to sort by engagement rate, and let me tell you why. This blog post here has gotten two visits and it's considered 100% engaged. That is meaningless when you've only had two views to the page. We're going to hover over here. If you look just to the left of Views, you see that little gray down arrow. We're going to click on the app and that's going to sort it in descending order by our page views. I'm going to give myself 50 rows here.

[00:13:55.470] - Sherry Smothermon-Short
And I'm looking for two things. I'm looking for a blog post with a low engagement rate and a blog post with a high engagement rate. I'm going to just start scrolling down through here. I'm going to skip my homepage and I'm going to skip any category and tag pages. Let's just keep scrolling down. Let's choose this handmade hiking sticks for our high engagement rate post. And then let's see. And we're going to use this kids' fingerprint activity for our low engagement post. Now, what I want you to do once you identify those things is open each of those in a separate tab. You'll have both of them open so you can look at both of them. What we're looking for when we have those two posts open is what are the differences between the two? What do we have in that high engagement post, the hiking stick post that makes people stick around or visit two or more pages that we don't have in the fingerprint activity? Or what do we have in the fingerprint activity that we don't have in the hiking stick activity that we might need to delete out? We're just going to do a comparison.

[00:15:04.620] - Sherry Smothermon-Short
Let's start at the top and just review these two posts. Does one of them have a paragraph before they have a picture and one doesn't have that? Does the paragraph say something like, use this fingerprint activity for your cub scouts, where the hiking stick one may say something like, Your cub scouts are going to love making their own hiking sticks that they can actually use or even give as a gift. Think about, is that more compelling than the wording that's in that first paragraph? Think about that. What am I saying at the beginning that's going to make somebody want to look down through there and stay on that blog post a little bit longer? Then I want you to look at where your links are. If one of the blog posts has some internal links pretty high up on the page and the other one doesn't, maybe you need to add some more links closer to the top for that one because it may be that people are saying, Well, this blog post is not for me, but man, look at this. It looks like I can click over and learn about this other activity that I may be more interested in.

[00:16:07.150] - Sherry Smothermon-Short
Compare those two blog posts and figure out what do you need to do. This is going to be a lot of trial and error on your part. And what works for my blog is not going to work for your blog. That's one of my pet peeves because somebody will come along and say, Oh, you must do this to be successful on your blog, or This is the only way to grow your blog. Okay, but that might not work for your specific and your specific voice and your specific blog. So you have to try things. Try them out. If it works, great. If it doesn't, revert back to what you had and try something else. This is going to be trial and error for you. The last thing that we're going to look at is our social media traffic. Let me show you what we're going to do here. We're going to stay on this page, path, and screen class, but I want us to add a secondary dimension, again, session source medium. Of course, this is all of our traffic. What we need to do is filter this down so that we just have traffic from one social media platform.

[00:17:07.810] - Sherry Smothermon-Short
The way we want to do the filtering is go over here to where you have customized report, click on the pencil. Then right here you can see this says report filter, and we're going to add a filter. What I want you to do is click on that and in the select dimension, we're going to search for session source medium. And we're going to say that we want to find a session source medium that contains, and then you type in the name of your social media platform. I'm going to do Facebook. We'll do that first and we'll also do Pinterest. One thing to note is that this is case-sensitive. And if you put a capital F, you're probably going to get no traffic. Make sure that this is lowercase. I'm going to click Apply. And then I'm going to save this. Since this is already a copy, I'm just going to save my changes to my current report. Then I'm going to click the back button. I'm not quite sure why, but Google switches this from page path to page title. I don't like to see the title. I want my page path. All you have to do is click this down arrow and click page path and screen class, and then it goes right back to what we had.

[00:18:28.920] - Sherry Smothermon-Short
It also sorts it by engagement rate again and I want to sort it by views. I'm just going to click that. I want to see what has happened over time. I can compare date ranges, just like we did in Universal, by clicking up here in this little date range up here. And then you have to scroll down a little bit and then you'll see Compare. And all we have to do is turn on the compare. As you can see, this is comparing the very last 28 days to the 28 days before that. Now you need to decide if that makes sense for your blog. It does not make sense for Cub Scout Ideas because Cub Scout Ideas is very cyclical. And so it's hard for me to compare month over month. What is much better for me is to compare year over year. What I'm going to do, instead of comparing it to the preceding period, I'm going to look at the same period last year. I'm going to click that and then I'm going to click Apply. We really want to look here at this Views column, but we want to see what has happened last year for this time frame compared to this year.

[00:19:34.080] - Sherry Smothermon-Short
Now, there are a couple of things that you need to keep in mind when you're looking at this. The first thing is when did you install GA4 on your site? If you're seeing all zeroes for the prior year, it probably means that you did not install GA4 until less than 13 months ago. Keep that in mind if you're seeing a lot of zeroes, know that eventually you'll be able to use this process, but you might not be able to use it right now if you're looking at year-over-year numbers. The second thing I want you to look at is the actual numbers. For some of these, depending on how big your blog is, the numbers may be relatively small. If I look at this, there's only a 22-view difference here. And you can see it's a small percentage as well. I don't want to make an action plan if I'm looking at 22 more views. Keep that in mind. Now, we're going to go down through and I'm going to point out some things to you. You're just examining your data. There's no hard and fast rules, but you're just examining your data and trying to figure out what could I do with this.

[00:20:40.830] - Sherry Smothermon-Short
I can see my service project ideas post did pretty well. Look at here. Last year, I had zero visits to this blog post from Facebook for this time frame. That probably means I did not share on Facebook about my blog post. I need to do that. This is actually something that is evergreen. And it should probably be in my rotation of blog post that get thrown on Facebook at least once a month. I'm going to write myself a note that every month I need to include this blog post in my Facebook postings. This one is a seasonal blog post. It's a little gift exchange story. It's actually pretty funny. But last year, I only got two visits, so I may not have even posted that at all during this time frame. This is one that during the holiday season, probably starting mid-October, I need to make sure that I'm sharing this maybe once a week. Let's keep going. Here's another evergreen post that I didn't post last year. Now we get down here and we see that there's a negative number here by a hiking stick post. When I look at this, I might think, Oh, my goodness, I need to do something because look at that, I dropped 13 %.

[00:22:05.010] - Sherry Smothermon-Short
But again, this is where those numbers come into play. You're talking a difference of nine views. I probably don't want to change any strategy over a nine-view difference. Now, if 13 % were 900, absolutely. Or even 90, absolutely. It depends on the size of your blog and what the pure numbers are. I'm just going to go down through here and look at this and see what do I need to do. I'm going to make sure my lefty Elf post is shared on Facebook at least once a week until the end of the year. That's something I'm going to take action on right away. Others of these, I may not do anything this year, but I may put it on the schedule to make sure that I post it next year during this time. Again, you're going to look at some things, you're going to make some notes, some things you may take action on now, some things you may add to your content calendar for next year. Let's look at Pinterest. I'm going to go into that customized report again, remove the filter by clicking the X. I wish there were a way we could just update the filter, but unfortunately, we can't.

[00:23:16.780] - Sherry Smothermon-Short
We have to start again. We're going to click Add Filter, click in the box again, and this is session source medium. Add that. We're going to say contains. Now we're going to say Pinterest. Don't forget that needs to be all lowercase and click Apply. I'm going to save the changes to this report. I'm going to go back. Then I'm going to make sure that I'm sorting by my views here. We can see that I've had a substantial uptick in Pinterest traffic this year versus last year. Now let's go down through here and see. Are there any negative numbers? With this increase, there may not be any negative numbers, but we may see some that have grown quite a bit less than 75 %. Let's scroll down through here and let's see. This one's only a 15 % increase. Now, this is my homepage. And to be honest with you, I'm not sure if I have many, if any, pins that just go to my homepage, but maybe I need to make some. Now, here's one that dropped, Cub Scout service project ideas. This should be one that I should be doing better on. Again, I'm going to put this on my list of blog posts that I need to either make new pins for, pin more often, whatever it is that you're going to do there.

[00:24:42.920] - Sherry Smothermon-Short
Again, I'm just going to go down through here. I'm going to pick out some blog post that it looks like I need to do something with, and then you wind up having some actions that you can take. You're going to have to test things to see what is going to move needle for your blog. Now, there's one more thing I want to show you on here. Remember I told you earlier that I didn't like these graphs up here because I just don't think they give you good information? I might look at this and think, Oh, my goodness, my Pinterest traffic totally went away for these four days. Well, no, it didn't. What happened here is that your top five posts took a little dip. And that's all this is reflecting. This is not reflecting everything over your blog as a whole. Just keep that in mind when you're looking at these, you might want to ignore them. That concludes our presentation. I'm going to go ahead and get rid of the screen there and bring myself back up. I hope this has been helpful for you. I do have a free gift for you. It's a workbook that you can use with the process that I outlined here so that you can take notes and write down, This is the blog post.

[00:25:53.780] - Sherry Smothermon-Short
Here's what I need to do on that blog post. Or you can also record your data in there so that if you want to go back and compare it, it'll be easy to do so. If you'd like to get in touch with me, feel free to email me at sherry@painlessbloganalytics. I'll be happy to help you with any questions that you have.
