[00:00:13.310] - Kim
Hey there, guys, it is Kim George here from yourchicgeek.com. And boy, am I excited to chat with you guys today and to give this presentation on how to create epic digital products that sale with Canva for passive profits. As you can see here again, I'm the founder of yourchicgeek.com.

[00:00:33.970] - Kim
And again, I'm just really excited to be here today to give you this information, so I really really hope you enjoy it. Let's get off into this presentation. Hey, as I just mentioned, this is just a little bit of information about me. I am the founder of yourchicgeek.com.

[00:00:54.700] - Kim
It is a website that I've dedicated to solopreneurs and creatives to help you guys create digital products for a passive income. I don't know about you, but there's nothing like being able to wake up in the morning after you have slept you know and to look at your phone and look at your email inbox and see that someone has someone from across the world has visited your website and bought a product from you. That's just one of the most amazing feelings in the world. And so, again, it's just something that I absolutely love to do.

[00:01:26.410] - Kim
A few things worth noting or note about me is I did graduate a long time ago with a master's in computer science, so I do come from the tech background.

[00:01:37.560] - Kim
I am a Starbucks addict. That is correct. I love Starbucks. I love their coffee, and I'm a bit of a snob when it comes to that. Also, I do love fishing.

[00:01:47.400] - Kim
This is something that me and my mom loves to get together to do. We are contra girls. And so, it's just something that I love to do. It's a favorite pastime of mine, and I told her that, yes, I do bait my own hook because I do. I wish I had a picture that I could have put here to show you guys, but absolutely love fishing.

[00:02:04.830] - Kim
And I also love all things DIY, design and tech, especially when it comes to using platforms like Canva, which has been a game changer for me, for my brand and for my business. Alright. So, a few workshop reminders, please, please, please. If you have any distractions, if you have your cell phone on and social media up or anything like that, I would ask that you please just kind of turn those off. I really want you to get as much out of this workshop or as much out of this presentation as you possibly can.

[00:02:41.130] - Kim
Also, if you have a paper and pen and you want to take a few notes, you may want to go ahead and get those out as well, because I am going to be covering quite a bit.

[00:02:50.420] - Kim
Okay, so again, I really hope you enjoy this information. Okay. So, here's a quick agenda, an overview of what you can expect to learn from this presentation that I'm going to be giving you guys today. So, number one, is we're going to talk about basically what I'm going to give you the backstory on how I was able to turn some of the ideas that I had into cash with Canva by creating digital products for passive income. Again, I didn't even know in the design world that or with Canva that some of the things that I've been able to create were possible and so, absolutely love the platform.

[00:03:24.920] - Kim
And so, we're going to talk through my backstory and leading up to selling digital products and things like that.

[00:03:32.210] - Kim
I'm also going to cover the top seven things that you need to have in place to make your digital products as irresistible as you can to your audience. I mean these are just suggestions, excuse me, in my years of creating digital products that have really helped me. And so, I'm going to be sharing those tips with you. I'm also going to talk about some tips for writing compelling headlines and product descriptions that get people excited to buy your products. I think these are some of the most overlooked things.

[00:04:03.860] - Kim
And so, I'm going to talk about that. And then we're going to cover some of the best tech platforms that you can use to sell your digital products. Plus, I'm going to give you guys some tips for marketing and promotions of your digital products and a whole lot more. So, again, this is going to be jam packed. Again, get ready, get ready.

[00:04:23.340] - Kim
Okay. So, here's a quick backstory about me and my discovery in Canva and how it's allowed me to create digital products just like the one that you see here on the screen. So, I have been online for a very long time. I had been running my website for a while. And I was doing more of the one on one kinds of work where you know I started off as a web developer. I was kind of doing websites, WordPress, websites and things like that.

[00:04:51.910] - Kim
And so I was just getting to the point where I'm like, you know what while I love the one on one work, it really would be awesome to be able to add extra revenue to the business where I didn't have to do as much one on one work where I can kind of generate income passively. And so, I started on the search on the web to kind of look for tools for design tools that I could use. And I discovered Canva, thankfully. And initially I just thought that Canva was just something that you could use just for graphic design.

[00:05:24.650] - Kim
That's it. I didn't know that you could use it to create some of the other things. Like again, this Journal that I created here, I didn't know that you could use it for that. I just didn't know. And so, as I started to use Canva and I learned it, I started to use it for way more than graphic design.

[00:05:43.780] - Kim
I started using it to create things like just different digital products and passive income products like journals, coloring books, notebooks, graphic sets, you name it. I really started to kind of get the hang of it and use it in way more advanced ways, which is super exciting for me. So, that's kind of my backstory into the world of going from just graphic design to more advanced design with passive income products. Okay. And so, I put here Canva has made it very easy for me to create all sorts of passive income products that you can sell and that I sell on different platforms that include graphic kits, which I just mentioned coloring books, journals, notebooks, branding kits, workbook templates, ebook templates.

[00:06:32.820] - Kim
You name it, pretty much anything that you want to create. If you have a little bit of creativity, you can do it with Canva. So, it really isn't all to the platform and how easy it is to use once you kind of get the hang of things. Okay. So, again, as I've grown to use Canva, it has been phenomenal for me.

[00:06:54.370] - Kim
It has changed the game for me, and I wanted to share with you guys in my years of experience of working with Canva to create you know different digital products, I want to share the steps, the seven step process that I use anytime that I go through with creating a digital product with Canva. Okay. So, here we go. So, if you're ready, let's go. I know you guys are probably familiar with this.

[00:07:18.140] - Kim
This is from Breaking Bad, which is one of my favorite favorite shows. I love it, love it, love it. So, let's go ahead and dive off into this So, step number one is to get specific, guys, really, really, really get specific.

[00:07:30.980] - Kim
And I put here at the bottom to create a product that solves one specific problem. When I first started creating products, I'm not going to lie. I just used to just put anything out there and just you know hope that it's stuck. Right. But I've learned over the years that it's better to be way more specific than just general with the products that you create and way more targeted, right?

[00:07:59.200] - Kim
It just really works better. So, here's an example that I'm using as an example for a wedding planner. So, if maybe you're a coach and you have customers that you help with planning their wedding. Instead of just creating a wedding planner for any type of bride, what you can do is you can create a wedding planner for a bride that is having a backyard wedding. So, that is way more specific and drill down than just any old wedding planner. So, if you are marketing this wedding planner for brides planning a backyard wedding, I'm sure that that would really ring and speak to that specific audience versus just any old wedding planner.

[00:08:46.550] - Kim
Now, I'm not saying that any old wedding planner would not work. But again, I just found that specificity sales. So, if you can get more specific, that tends to work out a lot better. Because if you're targeting everybody, you guys have probably heard this, you're targeting no one. So that's just an example of what I mean by just trying to get as specific as you can or solving one problem for one type of person. Okay. So, step number two is to create compelling titles for your digital products.

[00:09:16.760] - Kim
Oh, my gosh, guys. As bloggers, one of the things that we've probably heard, and you've probably heard. And I'm sure you're not in your head with this. Not in your head to this right is when you're creating a blog post, what is one of the first things that they told you to work on? It is going to be your blog post titles.

[00:09:35.680] - Kim
Yes, your blog post titles. So, just as your blog post titles are important, the same goes for your digital products. You definitely want to create a product that is going to hook you know the intended audience that you are trying to connect with. You definitely want to focus on that. So, here again, using the wedding planner as an example, instead of just doing something like the Ultimate Wedding Planner, which there's nothing wrong with that.

[00:10:06.660] - Kim
You could do something like the Ultimate Wedding Planner or the Ultimate Backyard Wedding Planner. How to plan a Stunning Wedding Budget, I'm sorry, a stunning wedding on a $500 budget. That is a great title. That is something that I would just look at and say, wow, this is very interesting. If I were a bride who I knew had a limited budget and I wanted to plan a backyard wedding on a $500 budget, which I don't even know if that's even possible.

[00:10:38.080] - Kim
But if I were planning a backyard wedding, this is a book that I would definitely be way more interested in buying because it's so targeted. It's so specific, and the title really speaks and resonates with me. Okay. So, it's just an example of something that I wanted to share, and this slide kind of just goes into that. So, again, the Ultimate Backyard Wedding Planner, how to plan a stunning wedding budget on a wedding on a $500 budget is much more specific. And I put here that this title is geared towards a specific type of wedding, which is backyard weddings.

[00:11:13.490] - Kim
It focuses on one type of bride, which is a bride that's interested in having a wedding in a backyard, and then it caters to brides that are you know maybe planning a wedding on a smaller budget. So, again, specificity and having a great title is definitely super important. Okay. Step number three is to where you can use power words in your product titles. Yes, power words in your product titles. So, power words to me are basically words that you can use, that can take your product titles from whole home and okay to oh, my gosh, I have to have this like, wow, I can't wait to find out more about what this is.

[00:11:59.760] - Kim
So, some examples of that would include Hot instead of using Hot like I used here, which is fine. You could use blazing. Instead of using pretty, you could use stunning. Instead of using beautiful, you can use appealing or visually appealing. Instead of using great, you could use sensational or instead of using awesome, you can use spectacular so on and so forth.

[00:12:24.150] - Kim
So, these are just a few examples of different power words that you can use to play up the titles of your books. And it really does work. I mean, it makes a huge difference. Okay. Step four is to make your products visually appealing.

[00:12:44.530] - Kim
Aka, make them look fabulous. I know that some people say that you shouldn't judge a book by its cover or et cetera, et cetera. With me being a DIY designer and having to kind of flail around for a couple of years to kind of make things connect with design projects that I've worked on and branding and things like that. I can tell you that the visual design and visually appealing design really does matter. It really matters.

[00:13:18.630] - Kim
I mean, think about it. It's like the first impression that people see when they see your products and if you have something. I'm sorry, but if you have a product that's looking a little sketch, people are not going to be probably as willing to want to learn more about it. Right? So, just think about it.

[00:13:37.330] - Kim
If you're on Facebook, when you're on Facebook or if you're on Instagram and you see something that jumps out at you nine times out of ten, because you know those are especially with Instagram because it's more of a visual platform. If that picture that you see is visually appealing or product that you see is visually appealing, it is going to draw you more into it. So, visual appeal definitely makes a difference. So, a couple of design tips that I have for you all, and this is really important. These are things that I had to learn over the years, took me a while to get it, and I finally did it.

[00:14:13.570] - Kim
Tip number one is to use complementary colors in your design. This just means to use colors that work well together. Now, another tip that I want to give you guys is when it comes to designing a product, any kind of products, I would just stick to two to three colors minimum. You don't have to go crazy.

[00:14:32.780] - Kim
You don't have to try to be Picasso when you're creating a product to make it look good, two to three colors and that's it. Okay, that's it. You don't have to go crazy with it. And so, one of the recommended resources that I suggest you guys check out where basically makes it super easy for you to choose color combinations because they're already put together for you is going to be color palettes.net.

[00:14:58.720] - Kim
So, definitely head over to check out that site because again, they have a plethora of color palettes there that you can use and apply to your products when you're designing them. Okay. So, tip number two is going to be use fonts that work well together. Two to three fonts max, the same with the colors two to three colors, two to three fonts. And you're good.

[00:15:21.970] - Kim
Right. A recommended resource that I would highly suggest that you all check out for font combinations if you struggle with putting fonts together is going to be fontpair.co, okay. That is a great resource that you can use. And again, much like the colorpalettes.net tool.

[00:15:40.170] - Kim
Fontpair.co basically shows you different combinations that you can use for fonts without, and it just takes the guesswork out of it. So you go there to the site, it's going to show you it's going to say, hey, here's a font. Click this to learn a font pair that you can use with this font. And it's just that simple. And then tip number three is to keep it simple.

[00:16:00.320] - Kim
And I mentioned this before. Good design does not have to be complicated. And so, the recommended resource of course, that I have for this is going to be Canva.com. And the reason that I love using Canva for design projects for creating passive income products is because Canva has already you know dozens, thousands of different templates that you can just click on, that you can change out colors, change out your fonts, add your own little designs to, so on and so forth, and you can use it to really make them your own.

[00:16:32.260] - Kim
I mean, it just makes it so easy to do that. Okay. Okay. So here are some product design examples that I have with Canva. And as you can see, you know these are simple.

[00:16:47.670] - Kim
They're not over complicated. I created all of these passive income products with Canva, and it was just pretty easy. So, you can see over here to the left, I have a workbook template set you know for people that are maybe you're a course creator that needs access to some workbook templates that you want to use for your courses. There's a set for you. I have ebook template sets.

[00:17:12.520] - Kim
And then I also have this graphic design set. And again, all of these passive income products were created with Canva. You can see that you know they all work well together. You can see that the fonts are similar. The color palette is similar.

[00:17:27.620] - Kim
So, this is just an example of product designs that can be created with Canva and very easily. Okay. All right. So step number five is to write great product descriptions. Guys, this is so important.

[00:17:46.370] - Kim
It is so, so, so, so important. So, write great product descriptions for your digital products. Super key, super important. And I'm going to go into talking about some tips on how to do this. And then I'm going to show you guys an example of what I believe is a very good and a well written product description.

[00:18:06.340] - Kim
Alright. So, some of the things that you want to include for your product descriptions are going to be features of the products. Now features and benefits are different. Features are you can kind of consider some of the more, what I'll say, the things that you can do with the product and the benefits are going to be things, the benefits that it's going to offer to the person that you're selling it to. So for an example, a feature of a notebook.

[00:18:39.650] - Kim
Let's just say a notebook, a feature of the notebook can be that maybe it's an 8.5 by 11 in size. That's a feature. Right. A benefit of the notebook is going to be you can use the notebook to take down notes. You can use it to track your appointments.

[00:18:54.650] - Kim
You can use it or use it as, you can give it to someone as a gift. You could use it to take down assignments. You can use it for all kinds of different things. That's going to be a benefit of using a notebook. Right.

[00:19:09.920] - Kim
Versus the feature is that it has a matte finish. It's an 8.5 by eleven in size or six by nine in size. Those are the features of the product. Right. So, it's really a difference, a key difference in those two.

[00:19:22.250] - Kim
All right. So, next I have who the product is the perfect fit for?. And I just mentioned that. Right. So, maybe if you're creating a passive income product, that's a notebook.

[00:19:31.170] - Kim
And maybe you're going to create a notebook for teen girls. Right. So maybe the notebook is a product fit, a great product for teen girls. And then what the product can be used to do. So, I just mentioned this.

[00:19:43.940] - Kim
Maybe you're creating a specific notebook for teen girls that helps them overcome anxiety. Or maybe you're going to create a notebook for teen girls that helps them, let's see, you know track their high school memories or something like that. Do you see? But that's way more specific. So that's an example of what the product can be used to do.

[00:20:07.730] - Kim
And then last but not least, this is very important is asking or not asking, but adding a strong call to action to your product descriptions that tell people what to do in order to get access to it. Okay. So, super important. Alright.

[00:20:23.400] - Kim
So, I have here as an example. And I thought that this was a really cute notebook that I found on Amazon. If you want to learn how to write great product descriptions, Amazon is the way to go. There's plenty of books, plenty of products out there. And so, I thought that this one was actually pretty good.

[00:20:42.770] - Kim
Okay. And so, as you can see here, this is the My Self confidence Journal for teen girls. It's created to help teen girls build confidence and boost self esteem. So, it basically just says, here are you looking for a Journal and diary that you can use for boosting self confidence, self love and self esteem for your teen girl? If so, this is the perfect resource for you.

[00:21:05.060] - Kim
This journal is the perfect gift hint for who was it for teens, twins and young women, and it's designed to help them build self confidence, think positively and encourages self esteem. That's really really good. Okay. So, we just talked about these things at the bottom. This Journal is. It has a matte finish.

[00:21:27.770] - Kim
It's eight by ten and dimensions. That's a feature. Matte Finish feature benefits. It includes daily prompts for boosting self esteem, self confidence, and practicing self love. That's a benefit.

[00:21:40.540] - Kim
It features decorative, acute journaling pages. That's a feature, that any teen will love, plus a space for adding cue stickers and writing self confidence boosting quotes for the day. That's really good. It also includes inspirational coloring pages that your teen will enjoy making their own work of art.

[00:22:01.060] - Kim
Wow, that's really a good benefit to using this journal, right? Makes the perfect inspirational notebook gifts, birthday gifts, holiday, et cetera, et cetera for ladies and teenage girls. If you're looking for a great journal for your teen that will help them build their self confidence and self esteem, and we'll encourage them to focus on what they have to offer to the world. Grab your copy today, call to action.

[00:22:27.430] - Kim
That is a really well written product description. So, this is just an example. Again, I would encourage you all to head over to Amazon and just go through some of the different books and things that they have there. I found this one, I think just by searching self confidence for teen girls or I don't know something like that. And this came up and I was like, wow, this is really really well done.

[00:22:49.100] - Kim
So, just an example here. Okay, so step six is to select a shopping cart/ecommerce platform to sell your digital products with. This is more of on the technical side of things, but this is definitely very important because you want to make sure that you have your product fulfillment in place and that it's a great product fulfillment platform that you're planning to use because take it from me. It doesn't matter if you're selling a $7 product or $700 product. If someone comes to your site and buys from you and they don't receive their purchase or they don't see it or whatever the case is, they're going to be upset.

[00:23:33.630] - Kim
Trust me, I've got emails. Hey, I don't see the product that I just purchased, can you tell me where it is and et cetera, et cetera. So, definitely make sure that your text systems are in place and that they are working as they should. Okay, so, some of the shopping cart platforms that I would ask you to consider or that are definitely worth considering are going to be, number one is Pay Hip.

[00:23:57.410] - Kim
Pay hip is one of my personal favorites. It's one that I do use right now and I'm transitioning over to this one, but it's a really great platform to use. It's free to use. It does all of the delivery for you. So, when someone comes to your site and they purchase something through the Pay Hip link that you add to your online website. Or if you just want to do a Pay Hip shop when they purchase that thing, Pay Hip is going to automatically send them their digital download.

[00:24:29.210] - Kim
And I absolutely love that because that way you know it's going to make sure that you know the purchaser or the person that's buying from you get their product that they ordered. Right. So it's going to make sure the fulfillment is good. Gum Road is another resource that I know a lot of people use. I used to use Gum Road, but I've since converted and went over to Pay Hip because again, I like the platform a lot better.

[00:24:53.560] - Kim
Sellfy is an additional one that's worth looking into. Woocommerce, I'm sure you guys are all familiar with WooCommerce. This is one of the big boys, of course, of the industry. It's been around for a long time. Woocommerce is specifically good if you are, for example, running a WordPress Shop and you want to add that ecommerce functionality to your WordPress website, right.

[00:25:19.600] - Kim
So, I have WooCommerce as well. But I do use it in conjunction with Pay Hip. Okay. And then last, but not least is Shopify. So, Shopify is notorious for the larger ecommerce stores, but it is a great platform to use if you're planning to run a large ecommerce store where you're selling a lot of passive income products and things like that.

[00:25:41.480] - Kim
So, again, these are just you know some of my favorites. A couple of these I do use. The other ones are suggestions that you can check out. And so, these are definitely some tech platforms worth considering. Alright.

[00:25:56.740] - Kim
So, step number seven is to market and promote your digital products like crazy. Listen, you've done all the work you've gone through all these seven steps, hopefully. Or the six previous steps that I've mentioned, hopefully. And now it's time to get the word out there about your products. I think this is where a lot of people kind of, I'm not gonna say fall off, but a lot of people kind of underestimate or they don't take a lot of time to put thought into the marketing and the promotion of their products.

[00:26:33.780] - Kim
It's fine. And it's great to have a product that looks really great.

[00:26:40.850] - Kim
You know the product description is great. I didn't include this, but the sale maybe you're going to create a sales page for it. The sales page is great, but if nobody knows about it, if nobody is seeing it, if you're not putting your products in front of eyeballs, then how else are you going to make the sales. So, definitely, definitely, market and promote the heck out of your digital products? Guys, when you have the opportunity to do so. So, these are a few low to no cost promotions and marketing ideas that I put together for you all.

[00:27:15.580] - Kim
These are just some of the things that I know that I've done in the past to promote products with.

[00:27:21.030] - Kim
And so, just wanted to share this with you guys. So, number one is maybe consider making product promo graphics so that you can market your digital products on social media. Social media is huge right there's Twitter, there's Facebook, there's Instagram, there is TikTok. I have not done TikTok. I've heard that it works well, I have not done it yet, but there's TikTok.

[00:27:45.920] - Kim
There is Pinterest. I don't know if I mentioned Pinterest, but there's Pinterest. There is YouTube. There's so many different ways and clever things that you can do to really get your products out there into different audiences. And if you have a budget, consider maybe even running advertisements.

[00:28:05.490] - Kim
I've done advertisements. They work very well. And so, if you do have the budget, I highly recommend looking into that as well when it comes to marketing and promoting your products on social media. Secondly, is scheduling a series of social media promo posts. So, maybe if you don't have an Ada budget, then what you can do is use a tool like buffer to set up to schedule different promotional posts.

[00:28:31.350] - Kim
Right. I've also heard that Later is a good one. I haven't used it yet, but I have heard great things about Later's platform when it comes to setting up tweets and setting up promotional posts or setting up posts that you can use or that you can put out there to social media. So that's another example of a marketing and promo idea. Number three is going to be creating a blog post about your product.

[00:28:56.340] - Kim
I've seen people do this really really well. So, create a blog post, tell people about your product what it includes, things like that. That's another way. Number four is sending a blast to your email newsletter.

[00:29:07.270] - Kim
Okay, if you have an email newsletter, definitely put it to use. I would you know err on the side of caution when it comes to blasting your email newsletter with just sale, sale, sale. Always start with value and lead with value first before you just start selling. So that's definitely something to consider. But if you do have a decent sized newsletter or email newsletter, definitely produce and let people know.

[00:29:34.470] - Kim
Hey, I have a new resource available. Here's a link to it. Check it out, et cetera, et cetera. Creating Pinterest pins that link back to your product. That is another way to get the word out about your products. And then last, but not least, this is a big one.

[00:29:49.960] - Kim
Is collaborating with other bloggers that have an audience that you want to reach. Now, sometimes you can do paid promotions to other bloggers, and sometimes you can just do a collaborative and a joint venture with other bloggers that are you know in a niche that you want to serve as well, so it can work both ways. But I always say, as I stated with the newsletter, make sure that you're leaving with value, right? You don't want to just take, take, take. You want to make sure that you're leading with value first.

Okay. So again, these are just some low cost marketing and promo ideas. If you want to take a picture of this, you can definitely do so. Okay, so here is a quick recap of what we've covered, and I know we've kind of gone through a lot, but I really do hope that you all have gotten some value out of what's been presented today, because again, these are things that I always consider and do when I'm creating digital products, okay, to sell. Alright.

[00:30:49.960] - Kim
So number one is create an irresistible title for your products. Again, your title, just like with the blog post, is going to determine whether or not someone looks at your products or skips over it. It's just as simple as that. So, definitely, definitely put a lot of emphasis on your product titles. You definitely want to do that.

[00:31:13.230] - Kim
Number two is to add power to your titles because they can definitely take them from a little kind of boring to more exciting and get people really excited about learning more about what it is that you have to offer. Okay. Number three is to solve one problem for one type of person. If you're marketing to everybody, you're marketing to no one. So, where possible, whenever you're creating your product, definitely try to hone in on the one specific type of person that you want to solve a problem for.

[00:31:48.480] - Kim
Okay, number four is to make your products visually appealing. And I gave you guys some tips for that, which include things like choosing great font combinations, making sure that your colors complement one another and then keeping things really simple on the design front. And, of course, using Canva or any kind of design tool that you feel comfortable with using to design and create those your products with. So, number five is to write great product descriptions. So we went through an example of a great product description that was pulled from Amazon.

[00:32:21.650] - Kim
And again, I suggest if you struggle with this, head over to Amazon and just look at some of the best sellers. Look at different books, you know look at different things and see how they have their product descriptions written to get an idea on how to write yours. Number six is to select a shopping cart platform to sell your products with. I gave you guys some suggestions for that. And then number seven.

[00:32:43.510] - Kim
Most importantly, okay, aside from the title and making a good product is to promote and market your products like crazy, right? It's one of the old things that we say is, what is it? I can't even think of the same right now, but just again, put a lot of emphasis into marketing and promoting your products. You want to let people know that this, hey, this is something that you can benefit from, et cetera, et cetera. You want to put a lot of emphasis into getting your products out there to you know get in front of as many people as you possibly can.

[00:33:17.420] - Kim
