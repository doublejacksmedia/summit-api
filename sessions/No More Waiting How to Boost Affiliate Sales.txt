Today, I want to share with you this crazy idea I had a few years back that I call the Affiliate Sales Booster page. Designed to basically do exactly what it sounds like. The whole premise is to get quick affiliate marketing wins, so money-making is fun and exciting.

[00:00:29.390] 
Hi. My name is Kimi Kinsey, and if you're not yet familiar with myself, who I am, and what the heck it is I'm all about. 

[00:00:36.520] - Speaker 1
I'm a wearer of many hats. Some would call me an online business strategist, a multi-passion entrepreneur, affiliate marketing nerd, or lady who just really likes to nap a lot. Whatever you call what I do, I just really enjoy throwing digital spaghetti at the wall and seeing what sticks. I like trying new things. I think it's fun, especially if it means that I can make some money doing it. 

[00:01:02.380] - Speaker 1
I love monetizing, especially setting up passive income streams and just letting the bits and bob's do their thing. So where did this big idea come from? Every year around Black Friday and Cyber Monday, all of these business tools and online entrepreneurs host these amazing sales. It's kind of overwhelming, and I found that I always seemed to miss out on getting really good deals, especially for my business tools. And this sucked because these sales are a great way to reduce overhead. 

[00:01:36.760] - Speaker 1
And of course, it's always nice to get education and systems and tools cheaper. I realized that if I was missing out, then there was a really good chance that my audience was too, including sales that I was hosting during those times. How could they possibly be expected to keep track of all of it? I get hundreds of emails on a regular day. Special sales only make it worse, and it's a nightmare to dig through. 

[00:02:06.830] - Speaker 1
So I thought, what if someone kept track of it for them? What if I did just a bit of work for my audience? And I devised a system to help me keep tabs on sales so that I could share them with people who trust me and my judgment? Wouldn't that be so helpful?

[00:02:24.390] 
So that's what I did. I built myself a way to help me keep track of sales and dates and important information so that I could share them with my email list and with my free Facebook group. But I also realized that I was likely going to get lost among the emails during all of these sales, and I needed somewhere I could send people that was just one central location, something that I could update as needed. There was no way that I could keep people up to date via email because that was just going to add to the noise. 

[00:02:58.110] - Speaker 1
So I decided, I was going to create a page on my website. I used Elementor, and I immediately organized all of the Black Friday and Cyber Monday deals into little different categories to make shopping easier. 

[00:03:12.600] - Speaker 1
I took the absurdity out of all of it. You didn't need to read 100 frigging emails just to find something worthy of your money. You just needed to browse them all in one location. It was stupid simple. The irony is that it actually made shopping easier for me as well. 

[00:03:29.480] - Speaker 1
My audience loved it. It was successful enough for me to try it again the following year, just refining the page and learning from my experience the year before to make significant improvements to the system, especially for keeping track of all the deals and the sales. And every year that I do this and every time I refine the process, I get better at it, and I make more money than the time before.

[00:03:55.840] 
Now you might be thinking this doesn't sound like anything new and you wouldn't be wrong. I don't claim to have invented the idea, but I will make claim to being the first person to implement the system that I created in a variety of ways for a variety of niches and time-sensitive shopping periods. 

[00:04:17.430] - Speaker 1
You see, when I think of my favorite ways that the affiliate sales booster page really shines it's during Amazon PrimeDay, which is a two-day event where Amazon has, like a bunch of products on sale specifically for Primemembers. The PrimeDay event is yet another noisy shopping experience.

[00:04:39.090] 
Now, if you're not familiar with how the Amazon Affiliate program works, it can be really difficult for bloggers to make money from, especially those who are new to blogging. The cookie is only for, like, 24 hours, meaning if someone clicks on your affiliate link, they have to make a purchase within those 24 hours for you to earn a commission. 

[00:05:01.120] - Speaker 1
It's also based on the last click. So if the potential buyer clicks someone else's affiliate link after yours, you're not going to qualify for a commission and then you have to manage to get three sales in the first 180 days of being in the program or they remove you. It's tough.

[00:05:21.040] 
Amazon is pretty fantastic at converting clicks into sales, but it can be a struggle for bloggers to get those clicks in the first place and then actually qualify for the commission.

[00:05:33.120] 
I decided to test the system again in 2020 using Amazon PrimeDay. It worked a little differently since I couldn't plan ahead in the same way. I wouldn't actually know what was on sale until the event started, but it only took me, like a couple of hours to change a few things on my page template and then grab all of the linked images and all of the text links from Amazon. But I was literally ready the same day to send an email to my list to offer them a page of PrimeDay deals for entrepreneurs, products that I had myself that were on sale that I love and regularly use, or stuff that I just thought was an incredible deal that they might want to check out. 

[00:06:14.880] - Speaker 1
I made 50 sales. This was a really big deal for new Amazon affiliates. Like I said, they have to make these three sales within the first 180 days or they get removed. 

[00:06:24.880] - Speaker 1
I just made 50 sales in the span of 48 hours. Was it a ton of money? No. Was it worth it? Absolutely. Yes. Not only did I make some money for a couple of hours of my time, I now had another use for this system and I felt ready to teach it to my students as something that they could try for themselves. You might be feeling a little skeptical as to whether or not this is really useful for newbies, and your feelings are totally valid. Will it work for someone just starting out, the people who arguably made the quick win the most?

[00:06:58.470] 
So I tested it again. When Amazon PrimeDay rolled around in 2021. I was so excited to test the system using a brand new website of mine that was not even 30 days old.

[00:07:10.270] 
Could I take a website with next to no traffic, less than 30 people on my email list, a couple of hundred Facebook likes, and less than 100 Instagram followers, all of which I had accumulated within a few weeks before, and make the system work? And on Amazon Primeday, I spent about an hour grabbing some deals on products that someone using a low carb or keto way of eating might enjoy. 

[00:07:36.100] - Speaker 1
I posted the page linked to my Facebook page, emailed my little list of 30 people, posted a few Instagram stories, and made one ridiculous tweet about my PrimeDay deals page. I made five sales.

[00:07:50.430] 
Now that you've heard all about the affiliate sales booster page, what it is, how amazingly awesome it is. I do want to challenge you to try it for yourself. So I want to show you a couple of examples of ones that I have done hopefully to inspire you and give you some good ideas.

[00:08:09.930] 
So, the first thing I'm going to show you here is Simply Low Carb. This one is very new. This was the first time I had ever run a page like this for this website. It was literally less than 30 days old when I tried it, and considering how new the website was and how very little traffic it was getting, I'm pretty impressed with it. It made money, which is really all anybody could possibly ever hope for. And if this were me being a brand new Amazon affiliate, I would have definitely made the three sales that I needed. So all in all, big win. 

[00:08:47.310] - Speaker 1
But I'm going to kind of show you a little bit about what's here and why, and maybe give you some ideas for creating your own. Otherwise, of course, I do sell an entire training on this to give you a lot more in-depth knowledge and a lot of more behind-the-scenes type stuff. But let's take a quick look. Shall we?

[00:09:09.930] 
So again, this is for Simply Low Carb. Obviously, everything here is very much about keto or a low-carb way of eating. Everything on the page is related to that. So I've broken it down into a few different categories, such as small appliances, kitchen gadgets, and supplements. People come here on the page and they can literally click to see deals that are related to each one. So for example, if I were going to click Kitchen Gadget, it's going to scroll down and show people everything that is kitchen gadget related.

[00:09:45.640] 
And literally, these are all Amazon links. So you probably saw up here at the very top I have my Amazon-specific Disclaimer, very important. But otherwise, all of these are Amazon links, the images, and the buttons. And it's as simple as coming in here to Amazon, and I can come to any product. Just click on this for reference, and all I have to do is I can grab my text link. 

[00:10:14.030] - Speaker 1
It's very important that you grab the full link, make sure you're getting the right tracking ID for that particular link. You can grab your whole link and you'll put that in for your button, and then you also would be able to grab just the image you never, ever, ever want to right-click and download an image from Amazon. That's a big no, no, but you can come here, grab that and again, put that in. And this is what it ends up looking like. It's very nice. 

[00:10:45.530] - Speaker 1
It's really easy for people to shop from, and it takes out a lot of the noise. It gives people a really great way to shop without all of the noise of Amazon. Again, this is just an Amazon PrimeDay example. You could do this for anything. Really. 

[00:11:07.840] - Speaker 1
It doesn't have to be specific to Amazon, but this is what the whole page looks like. It's mostly me giving people things that they can purchase at a discount during Amazon Primeday. There are also some nice little things here in the center. These aren't quite what you're looking for. I give people another opportunity to pick up an Amazon affiliate cookie by clicking other buttons that lead them to places that might be relevant to them. 

[00:11:37.530] - Speaker 1
I also give them a place to go to support small businesses during Amazon Primeday, which I think is awesome. It looks like I have a broken image here. This page is a little bit out of date, so not surprised.

[00:11:52.290] 
But otherwise I also use this as a list-building opportunity so people can come and sign up if they want to get emails from me. The next time I host this page, they can sign up for that and get alerts. I also tell people a little bit about myself and give them an opportunity to share the page. 

[00:12:16.950] - Speaker 1
Honestly, again, it worked really well. I was very surprised that it worked so well for such a brand new website, but this worked great. Now, this isn't the first time I've ever done this. Normally I am in the niche of people that are entrepreneurs like myself, and so we have my PrimeDay Deals for Entrepreneurs and I have this open in Elementor so I can show you just how easy this is. I do actually also sell a template that is meant for Elementor for the free version to make this a lot easier because I know all about that page designing life and how difficult it can be. 

[00:12:57.390] - Speaker 1
Same concept though. We've got my Disclaimer up here at the top and we've got a few different sections here that are related to being an entrepreneur. So things like for their office, for their home, and for their sanity.

[00:13:13.110] 
One thing that I did start doing was making sure that I did things like giving people a reminder to sign up to become a Prime member. I don't know if you know this, but you can actually earn pretty good money from Amazon by getting people to sign up for Prime. Instead of it being like a few pennies for a sale, it's like $3 every time, which really adds up quickly.

[00:13:39.390] 
I also gave people an opportunity to see the best deals for entrepreneurs that were under $25. So basically, I went on to Amazon and kind of filtered things down until I got things that were the best rated under $25 and was showing products specifically in the niche that made sense. And then the same concept that you've already seen. These are all just linked to products. 

[00:14:10.030] - Speaker 1
So these are buttons and there are Amazon links in here. These images are just HTML, which you would grab directly from Amazon. Again with suggesting, "Hey, this isn't quite what you're looking for. You can check out these home office deals." Giving people a way to support small businesses.

[00:14:37.410] 
Again, offering people an opportunity to join my community. If people wanted to get alerted the next time that I do this, people sign up for this every year. I love the fact that I can add people to my email list and let them know, hey, the new one is out and of course, a way to share the page. These work super well. This page, in particular, earns me a good chunk of money every year. Again, does not have to be for the Prime day.

[00:15:07.050] 
Anyway, so I really hope that seeing this gives you some really good ideas and inspires you to try this out for yourself. It's honestly not very difficult to do. I think the hardest part, in my opinion, is actually creating the page and deciding what your deals are going to be for that page.

[00:15:30.810] 
Every year, I'll usually run the event live and I'll work with some students, and I can tell you, every year the biggest question I get is, "What products do I add?" And honestly, I'm going to give you a little bit of a hint. I like to add whatever I think I would want to buy. Things that make sense to me, works perfectly fine. A lot of people are just honestly looking to spend money, which is honestly the big thing here. People are looking to spend money, and they want to know where their money would be best spent without having to dig through all of Amazon. So I like to just try to make sure that I'm choosing things that make sense, things that I already own, that's a big one for me, and things that I feel good and comfortable recommending. 

[00:16:24.360] - Speaker 1
So I hope that you give this a shot. Allie is one of my favorite examples because she implemented the strategy for Amazon Prime Day very last minute. Literally, she was putting the page together the night before. She was a busy mum. She had a newborn during the Prime Day, and there was just a little time for her to be working on this. 

[00:16:46.150] - Speaker 1
The only time she had available was after the baby went to bed and before she crashed herself, and she was worried that she wouldn't even have the base of her page ready in time to snag products the day of. But she breezed through it and put together a beautiful page of Prime Day deals for crafters using my Elementor page template.

[00:17:05.690] - Speaker 1
Allie only had time for sending out one email about her page to her list and sharing it once on Facebook, and that's kind of what I love about this. It doesn't take a lot of promoting. It doesn't take a big audience either, which I proved for myself. I used it on one of my new websites. 

[00:17:23.010] - Speaker 1
She got over 100 sales in those two days, and you can literally see when she implemented the strategy in her analytics. That's all great. But honestly, the joy she got from it was what I loved the most! She excitedly posted in the pop-up group, showing everyone her results. And I'm so glad she's letting me share this with you, too. 

[00:17:43.990] - Speaker 1
Genuinely, the best part of the system is a quick win because it's so encouraging. Finally, something is working and now she can clearly see the fruits of her labor. I'm very excited to see what you do with this, and if you do decide to give it a try, I hope you'll reach out to me and show me what you've done.
