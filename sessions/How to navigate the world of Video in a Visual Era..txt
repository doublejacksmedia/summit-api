[00:00:13.490] - Marvin
Welcome. Welcome. Welcome. I am Marvin Flavien and this is how to navigate the world of video in the visual era. I'm so happy you decided to spend your time with me today, so let's get into it. It's a little bit about me. I'm a video marketing strategist. I'm the owner of N K Flay Video.

[00:00:30.120] - Marvin
I help service based entrepreneurs and coaches connect with the audience online and scale it using video online. And I actively create content for my brand. Everything I'm going to share with you today is something that we do and what we do for our clients. So, we are going to impact in this presentation a very simple yet effective way to leverage video for your business to reach an audience. So, let's get into it.

[00:00:52.540] - Marvin
This is for you if you don't know how to get started brand new with video, or maybe you've done some stuff didn't really work out the way you wanted to, but at least you tried. This is for you too. Or if you're actively creating videos, you're probably crushing right now. At least looking for a better system or better hacks.

[00:01:11.500] - Marvin
Let me know in the comments. Are you A, you don't know how to get started? B you tried it, maybe worked with someone before or C, you actively creating videos and you just looking for a better system for some better hacks. So, let me know which one are you in the comments?

[00:01:30.450] - Marvin
Alright, cool. So, today we're going to talk about how to navigate the world of video in a visual era, but before we jump into it, I just want to let you know. Look, if you haven't had success yet, it's not your fault. Maybe no one ever showed you the right way to do it, or no one's really teaching or showing you the right way to do it. People are probably just copying other people and doing whatever they think is trendy at the time and you know.

[00:01:57.390] - Marvin
Or you're probably missing a piece. And you don't really have a real strategy that you can go to. But I'm here to tell you that all ends today. So, I want to ask you a question. When you hear the word video, what do you think about?

[00:02:12.890] - Marvin
How does that make you feel? What's the first thing that comes to mind? Give you some time, right? Does it frustrating? Is it the platform? Is it the gear, the tech?

[00:02:24.670] - Marvin
Like, what is it that I want to know where you are when you hit that word video, you can comment. I'll be reading some of them off. You can comment. But let's take a step back, step back and examine what video really is. What is video? For starters, it's a tool.

[00:02:42.600] - Marvin
It's a powerful tool that exists outside of time and space. It's not bound by our laws. What does that mean? Well, listen, you're here. You're listening to me.

[00:02:52.540] - Marvin
You're watching me. You're bound by this task. We're here right now, right? You're not here. You're not there.

[00:02:59.150] - Marvin
You're not anywhere else but here. So, video doesn't play by these rules. Video can be here. Video can be there. Video can be over there all day, every day, twice on Sundays.

[00:03:10.150] - Marvin
So, think about that. Think about that. Think about that kind of power and what it could do for your business. And notice how I didn't classify as video as a real or going live or a piece of content. Why?

[00:03:22.790] - Marvin
Because it's so much more than that. And when we start looking at video for what it truly is. We can start looking at how we can actually use it. So, what is video? I think it's the most powerful business tool in the world. It hits at the core of every business pillar.

[00:03:39.690] - Marvin
Business revolve around time, money and relationships, right? Businesses need time. They have time, they can solve any problem. Businesses need money, they need money, they have it.

[00:03:51.670] - Marvin
They can solve any problem if they need. Businesses need relationships, they need connections. Right. If they have it, they can solve any problem. And video hits at those three cores of the business. Video can automate time.

[00:04:04.390] - Marvin
A lot of things companies are doing. They're repeating over and over again. You can make a video and implement it, so you can get your time back. You don't have to do that thing over and over. We all know video increases conversion anywhere you put.

[00:04:18.570] - Marvin
Anywhere you put. Video builds relationships. It builds trust. Think about when you've seen the video of a business or company of a person. Think about how more friendly you felt or like you felt like you knew them because of that video.

[00:04:34.050] - Marvin
You know video itself can even be the product. Video can be the product that you sell, right? And I want to break it down like video into two different strategies for you to make it simple and sum it up. Offense and defense strategy.

[00:04:51.150] - Marvin
I don't even watch those, but this is your video strategy. Think of football, right? You got offense line. You got a defense line like they play a specific role. They have a job to do.

[00:05:03.270] - Marvin
Think about that same thing with video. Offensive video is where you put things out into the world, to bring people into ours, into yours or ours. This is where we see most of our content, like on social. It's real tiktoks going viral. That's where all this comes to play, you know putting things out into the world to bring people into ours.

[00:05:23.980] - Marvin
Scrolling your feed might have never been connected with them, but they see it. That's offensive video, right? That's the offensive. Defense is when people go looking for you, you know they're looking for more information about you. And most of the time, people are driving traffic to either their website or funnel. But these videos will live there to give them the information that they need.

[00:05:45.410] - Marvin
You know a term we like to use is securing your defense, where videos are placed, where decisions need to be made.

[00:05:53.470] - Marvin
I want you to look at it and think of it. So, as for your defense, this is an area where you can save so much time in your business, like you never have to explain what you do over and over again. Right? Video does that for you when they get on that video. This is what they do.

[00:06:08.760] - Marvin
Alright, cool. Cool. Cool. I want to work with this person. Video can do that. And it can be working for you at all times. Someone can be on your website right now.

[00:06:18.130] - Marvin
Someone could be on my website right now learning about me, my company, who I am, and if they want to work with me or not. That's all happening while we're here. Defense, that's the power of that. We can qualify. Prospects can save time, especially if you're in a service base business. Providing service can qualify prospects.

[00:06:37.070] - Marvin
They can see they like you. They get to see a process and things like that. So, you don't have to do that outside of that. That's what defensive video strategy can do. So, people are looking for you, and if it's done right, they get to experience to you, you know.

[00:06:51.340] - Marvin
And this can play a huge role in your sales process, too. Hey, watch this video, book a call or call before you know. One of our clients is a coach, and when they help on sales calls, they're ready to go because the video that they seen gives them all the stuff that they need. They're excited to work with them. They're ready to go.

[00:07:11.540] - Marvin
And you can have that, too. Alright. Now, offense. Now, this is the sales, the money, the building connection, the relationship. This is where your offensive video strategy comes into play.

[00:07:20.870] - Marvin
There's many ways to go about this, are you? I'm not going to tell you what's going to be right for you, because I need to know more about you with your goals and what you're doing. But the two things I can give you and we're going to talk about this more later in a bit in a second. But understand where your audience is and who your audience is and what your goals are. So, you have to know going into it.

[00:07:41.440] - Marvin
What is it? I want to get out of it. What is it I want these videos to do? And then where is my audience and who's my audience? Alright.

[00:07:50.750] - Marvin
So, how do we navigate the world of video in a visual era? Well, the first thing you can do is secure your defense. You know implement video to your sales practices like we talked about before, like my coach client. Right. The point of this is to not build any new strategies but like focus on accelerating the current things that you're already doing, the stuff that you're already good at.

[00:08:11.860] - Marvin
If you're great, your product and service is great, why not implement a video that can help you save time on consultations or maybe skip them all completely. Some people can do that. We have some clients who do that. And that's the thing. You don't have to really you know add anything new, but it changes with the stuff that's already there and that's good and working.

[00:08:34.950] - Marvin
That's a perfect opportunity to implement a video, right.

[00:08:41.430] - Marvin
If you're doing it, and if it's working, you can unbound yourself from that time. So, when people go looking for you, they have a video that gives them all the stuff that they need to know to make a decision if they want to work with you or not. And we kind of have a way of doing this. We call it a video business card.

[00:08:55.900] - Marvin
It's a two minute video answer where people are excited about the company. They want to learn more about the company. This video indoctrinates them on what this company is about you know. But listen, yours doesn't need to be like that. All you really need to do is welcome your visitors.

[00:09:09.550] - Marvin
You can record a video, explain who you are and welcome them to your site. Give her a face to her name, right. Now if you want to step into the realm of offensive video, here's something that can help you. And I'm proud to introduce to you my COOL method. Alright.

[00:09:24.340] - Marvin
Very cool. Very cool. So the COOL method offensive strategy basically put it. Define your call to action. Right? Focus on that one person.

[00:09:36.390] - Marvin
Get over the gear and leverage the platform. Define the call to action so that your viewers can take action. Focus on that one person, so you can help the person and get your message out clear and it's clear and it's engaged and get over the gear so you can just do it. You can get into it and do it and leverage the platform, so your videos can work for you. Now we're going to go dive into it.

[00:09:59.570] - Marvin
Alright. Now call to Action unless you're a YouTuber likes and comments are not call to action, again unless you are a YouTuber, that's your main thing. Likes and comments are not a call to action. Your video needs to have what's next? What is the next step that you take?

[00:10:16.380] - Marvin
What do you want your viewers to do? You did all that work. They got them to watch your video and they loved it. They probably enjoyed it. They got to it and you're not going to offer them something.

[00:10:26.150] - Marvin
You're not going to invite them to join you at the end. Like you really don't need to have a call to action. So, what are your goals? What do you want the outcome to be? This is what you need for your video, especially if you don't offer the video.

[00:10:41.610] - Marvin
It needs to have a call to action. And one thing just to point out if you're reaching cold audience and they're landing on your video, you got to give them what the video is about right away. Get to the point, provide the value and then get them to commit or like, you know how YouTubers, when they say, like this video. You don't want to do that, especially if it's for a cold audience. You want to tell them what the video is about.

[00:11:05.360] - Marvin
Get to the point. So you can, like, make a decision, like, I want to stay here and watch this and then you give them that call to action. Maybe in the beginning, maybe in the end, depends. But you get to the point. Focus on that one person.

[00:11:17.400] - Marvin
This is  super super super important. Super important. Focus on your ideal person. Give them a name, you know talk to them. What do they need?

[00:11:26.450] - Marvin
What is it that they want? How do you want them to feel watching this? You know I'm going to say this. Stop trying to go viral. Stop trying to talk to everybody.

[00:11:37.210] - Marvin
If you're talking to everybody, you're talking to no one. You need to be focused on that one person and talk to them directly. And that one person can be multiple people. But you're talking to that specific need and the thing that they want. And you know that's how you can make, especially your video creation or so much easier, because your focus, you're honed in to that one person.

[00:12:01.020] - Marvin
Everyone is trying to go viral and try to get as many views as possible, which is a horrible strategy, because if it doesn't work out, you're going, you're to be upset about it. But anyway, focus on that one person. And if you want to get comfortable on camera, this is going to help you tremendously, because you are literally talking to that person that needs your help and you're talking to them. You know you get more practice and talking to them directly. You're not talking to everyone, talking to those right people.

[00:12:27.770] - Marvin
Other people can watch your video, of course, but they're the people that's going to be super engaged with it because you're talking directly to what they need and what they want. And I just got to say this, like, video isn't just about entertainment. Focus on the value that it brings. You can be the voice with message that the person needs to hear, to invite them to join you, to join you on your mission or get the help that they need. It's not about all about entertainment.

[00:12:54.490] - Marvin
Yes, some people are just naturally entertaining and funny, but that's not all what video is about. And as far as getting over the gear, quality is subjective. But your impact is not. Say that again, quality is subjective, but your impact is not. Your camera doesn't matter.

[00:13:16.340] - Marvin
Maybe your surroundings, your background, your lighting, audio is really more important anyway. But if you only got a phone, use your phone. If you only got a webcam, use your webcam like someone could be out there right now and you can help them. But we're not going to show up because we don't have a fancy camera. We don't got the latest Iphone, we don't got the latest 4K thing.

[00:13:38.870] - Marvin
We don't have a great camera, and we're not going to show up because of that.

[00:13:45.030] - Marvin
That doesn't sound right, and you shouldn't operate like that one. So, get over the gear. And like I said before, audio is probably more important anyway over the video quality anyway, because if video can look great, but if it doesn't sound good, most people won't watch it. So, some quick tips is just keep the mic as close as possible. I like to use Lav mics if you do something that can plug directly into your phones and things like that, but keep your mic as close to you as possible.

[00:14:12.840] - Marvin
You don't want your camera and your mic here and you're shooting all the way back there. It's not what you want. Alright. Now optimize the video on each platform. So, leverage the platforms. Some of the mistakes I see people see, some of the mistakes I see people make.

[00:14:30.830] - Marvin
People are not pinning a video on top of their social. It's hard to one of the best tools. If someone new landing on your page, you can pin a video to the top and they can watch that. They don't have captions on platforms that partisan video Instagram. Most people sometimes are scrolling and they don't hear anything, but they can read or see captions.

[00:14:53.330] - Marvin
Another thing too, is please repurpose your content. Please do not post it one time and think it's going to do all things that needs to do, especially on social media, especially your website. Like I said, defense, that's totally different. This is all offense we're talking about right now. Repurpose the content.

[00:15:10.830] - Marvin
The video that you create could be turned into multiple pieces of content you know. This is what we do for our brand. It's what we do for our clients. But just get it out of your thought process that I posted already. No one knows going to watch it like, no, keep putting it out there.

[00:15:26.940] - Marvin
If you know how the algorithm works. People are not seeing everything the first time, and people are not seeing everything you post at all times. So, it's okay to put things out there into the world and putting it out in different ways and things like that. So that's what I want you to do. You want video to work for you?

[00:15:43.920] - Marvin
You need to leverage the platform that we have. I'm not even talking about ads. I'm really talking about organically leveraging the path of the tools that they have, the playing by their rules. This is what you can do. Alright, so let's recap. What we're going to do.

[00:15:58.360] - Marvin
Secure our defense, record a video, explain who we are and welcome our new visitors to our site. Give them a face go and they define our call to action, so we can get our viewers to take actions. Remember, like some comments on our call to action. Focus on that one person. How you can help them? So, your message is clear.

[00:16:15.530] - Marvin
It's engaging. Get over the gear so you can create freely and authentically leverage the platform so your videos can work for you.

[00:16:25.290] - Marvin
And look, I'm going to give you my permission that you need it to show up authentically as you are. I don't know where I would be if I never posted that video. This is like one of my earlier video content series. It was consistently, so it wasn't just like a postal one. It was a port piece in that series, but I don't know where I'll be.

[00:16:47.420] - Marvin
I know for a fact. I want to be here talking to you if I never posted that. Gave my audience so much value at that time and gave me a lot of confidence because getting to see like, oh, this is what people need help on you know. I got to learn so much about me, my audience and all different things. So, I don't know where I'll be if I never posted that video. So, here is my permission to you to just show up as you are.

[00:17:12.870] - Marvin
And remember, you're helping people. Don't let the fear of what other people may think hold you back from reaching the people, your people, those people. And I promise you it was the most rewarding and also feeling when someone reaches out, you get a client or someone says, like, this piece of content, video actually helps. No, it's the most awesome thing. Just remember that. And video is not about being flashy.

[00:17:37.070] - Marvin
I keep saying it's not about entertainment. It's not about being flashy. It's really about a tool that merges and bridges that get that reality and bring forth that experience. That's what video is. That's what video is about.

[00:17:50.710] - Marvin
So, focus on that one person. Don't try to go viral. Don't even worry about it. Your people will be attracted to how clear your message will be because it is for them. Even if it helped one person, it helped one person.

[00:18:07.350] - Marvin
That's all that matters. Right? So, if you're good at what you do, if you're helping people for changing lives, what you can do is allow more people to see it. You can bring more people into your world and share these stories. Something I like to say is show, don't tell. Show.

[00:18:25.670] - Marvin
Don't tell. So, if you have a great product, show it. If you provide a great service, show it. Did something awesome for a client, show us. Show us the story, tell us the story, but also show us. And that is how you navigate the world of video and a visual era.

[00:18:44.050] - Marvin
So if you made it this far, I appreciate it. Thanks for hanging with me. I really hope this helps. And honestly, I really can't wait to see what you all come up with and deal with this. And if you're looking for some more hands on support, I have a free training ten videos to help you get comfortable on camera.

[00:19:02.630] - Marvin
Tell you exactly what the topic should be about and how you should kind of go about it. I'm just head to that link, and it should be there. I'm pretty sure there's a button down somewhere where you can click it and kind of get into it. But that's that. And honestly, too, if you're ready to work with someone, if you think that okay, I might be ready to step into this.

[00:19:21.040] - Marvin
You can definitely reach out to us. Just head to our website and you know schedule a call. We do have different ways of working with people, whether you're locally or not. We have a lot of different ways. And like I was talking about as far as, like, there's many ways to go about as far as like your offensive video, we pretty much have our own system, our own formula, how we go about creating content. That's one manageable.

[00:19:42.190] - Marvin
You get the most out of it as far as time, and we get a lot done. And pretty much, we basically do it for you, or we show you how to do it and we manage it for you. So, there's a lot of different ways that we can do it. All you have to do is reach out and have a chat with us. But like I said, thank you so much for spending this time with me.

[00:19:57.680] - Marvin
I can't wait to hear all the other speakers. It's about to be a super, super awesome summit and can't wait to see more. And I appreciate you being here. So this is my free gift to you. And until we see each other again, hopefully, I'll see you one of your videos.

[00:20:08.790] - Marvin
Hopefully, I'll see you on the Facebook group, but, yeah, that's it.
