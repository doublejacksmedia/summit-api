Hello, hello. I'm Leanne Chapman, if we haven't met before. You may also know me by my maiden name, Leanne Scott, as I very recently got married, so my name changed. Today, we're going to be talking about five types of passive income funnels that are going to help you to boost your sales. These funnels enable you to make income in between your launches and your flash sales. So a little bit of background about me before we dig in. So I started my career actually as a doctor, but I struggled with burnout and working really long hours and I wanted more work-life balance. So I initially started out doing some travel writing and eventually created a successful travel website, which was monetised mostly through affiliate marketing and ads. Later, I transitioned to becoming a passive income strategist, helping others to automate and streamline their own online businesses and income streams. I'm the founder of Passive Income Superstars, and I teach on topics like affiliate marketing, digital products, email marketing, sales funnels, and generally anything that helps online business owners to regain their work-life balance. So today we're going to be covering five Set and forget funnels. These include some options that you may be familiar with already, like tripwire funnels and evergreen email funnels.

[00:01:24.040] - Leanne Chapman
But we're also going to cover some newer concepts today, such as trigger funnels, affiliate funnels, and sales page funnels. And hopefully this is going to spark some ideas for you on how to generate revenue in between your own launches. But first, what even is a funnel? So a funnel is essentially a journey that you create that guides your potential customers, starting with warming them up so they start to feel like they know, like and trust your brand, and importantly, see you as a credible expert in your niche. And then the journey usually ends with a specific call to action, usually in the form of a paid offer. When we're talking about the context of sales funnels. So funnels can serve various purposes, but for our discussion, we're focussing on sales funnels, specifically evergreen funnels, that work in the background, generating passive income with minimal ongoing effort. But please know that when I talk about passive income, I do not mean easy income. I mean smart income. You'll need to do some work up front to get these funnels set up. But the payoff is that you will continue to make sales from your funnels on an ongoing basis, as long as there are leads entering the funnels.

[00:02:33.360] - Leanne Chapman
Before diving into the specifics, let's quickly discuss urgency, because I'll be referring to it throughout the presentation. Now, some people dislike urgency, feeling that it can be a little bit icky. Personally, as a customer, I actually really appreciate urgency. As somebody who's a bit of a poor decision maker, it actually helps me to make decisions faster and it prevents me from experiencing decision fatigue where I spend far too long overthinking things. And I think it's important to remember that even if you don't like countdown time as yourself, there are just as many people out there who do like them and perhaps even need them in order to make a purchase. You can, of course, make some sales without using urgency, but offering a reason to buy now usually results in far more conversions by helping people to prioritize decisions and avoid lengthy periods of indecision. Some people dislike urgency because it's sometimes used unethically. Like, for example, fake countdown timers that reset automatically or pushy tactics where sellers make people feel bad or silly for not buying their offer. However, when used responsibly, urgency can be really beneficial, especially for neurodivergent audiences who often struggle with decision making.

[00:03:48.950] - Leanne Chapman
If you are clear, you're fair, and you give a reasonable amount of time for decision making, then urgency can actually be a really helpful tool. But as with all things in business, it's your choice if you use it or not. The first funnel type we're going to look at is the tripwire funnel. So you may already be familiar with this. This is one of the most common types of funnels used in online business. This is basically where an offer is presented on a thank you page, typically after somebody joins your email list, but it can be used in other scenarios. So for example, if you submit an offer to a collaborative bundle, somebody signs up for it, you might then offer them a tripwire at that point. TripWires are an early stage offer, so products need to be low cost and easy to say yes to because people don't know you yet. So usually something priced between about $15 and $47 tends to be about the sweet spot. At this stage, your customers are just getting to know you, so expensive offers might not be quite as effective. I find that in general discounts of around 50% work really well for trip wires.

[00:04:53.100] - Leanne Chapman
So for example, a $40 offer reduced to $20 or an $80 offer reduced to $40 could work really Ensure that your tripwire offer appeals to the same person who opted in for your freebie. The offer doesn't need to be directly related to the freebie, although it can be. But if you choose something which solves another part of the same puzzle, it should be clearly different to avoid confusion. So for example, if you are a photographer and your audience wants to learn how to edit photos, you could share a guide to getting started with Lightroom as your freebie, but then you could share some Lightroom presets as the tripwire. So although it's solving the same problem, it's doing it in a different way, and they're very clearly different solutions that work well together. To create a tripwire funnel, don't start from scratch. You can just duplicate your existing sales page, add a countdown Timer, keep it really simple, tool. You can use tools like hurry Timer, which is a free plugin for WordPress users. There's the Elementor Pro's countdown Timer, or you can use ThriveCarts' built-in countdown Timer. There are advanced tools that you can use, like Deadline Funnel, which offer a lot more features, especially in terms of tracking your tripwire funnels, but they certainly aren't necessary for a basic tripwire.

[00:06:08.760] - Leanne Chapman
So I'd only really recommend investing in a tool like this if you're planning to build other types of funnels, too. So the next type of funnel is an evergreen email funnel. So these are longer multi-day funnels that are designed to warm leads up over time, eventually transitioning to sales emails. Typically, you start by attracting people with a lead magnet that appeals to somebody with the problem that your end offer helps to solve. After a warm-up sequence, you move them into a sales sequence, which can often be created by repurposing launch emails. Evergreen email funnels work best with time-sensitive discounts or bonuses to encourage quick action. Unlike trip wires, which are triggered by page views, Evergreen email funnels are triggered externally by somebody signing up to your or having a tag added to their profile inside an automation. You'll need a tool that syncs your countdown timers across your emails, your sales pages, and your checkouts to ensure that the countdown remains consistent across devices, allowing viewers to see the same Timer regardless of how and when they engage with the funnel. The tool that I recommend using for this is Deadline Funnel. There are a couple of alternatives, but not very many, and they don't tend to be quite as robust as Deadline Funnel.

[00:07:33.090] - Leanne Chapman
Another one that I've used personally is Thrive Ultimatum. I found it to be quite tricky to use, and I definitely saw better conversion rates when I switched to Deadline Funnel. And below you can see an example of how well these sorts of funnels convert. If you're really spending time to warm somebody up to you, you tend to find that the conversion rates are fairly good, which is why evergreen funnels work so well. Perhaps it's not going to work quite as well as your launch comes conversion rates because people in a launch are also saying things on social media. There's a lot of buzz, there's other people are joining at the same time. It creates a sense of excitement. So you might not get quite the same conversion rates, but you can still achieve some very good conversion rates with these types of funnels because we are pitching the offer to somebody when they are at their warmest. So for example, here was a funnel. I didn't promote it. It was completely organic. People were basically landing on blog posts that they found via searching on Google or perhaps looking on Pinterest. They were seeing a freebie, signing up for it, and then they entered my funnel.

[00:08:37.910] - Leanne Chapman
I didn't promote the freebie or mention it. It was literally just working in the background. So during that month, I had 192 people go through that funnel, generating seven sales at a price of $297. This totaled $2,079 in revenue. And you can see this can be really quite lucrative because it's a hands-off approach. So you could still be out there launching other products, doing other things that make you money, like offering services or creating new offers, that this is all additional income that you wouldn't have made otherwise because you're not going to be doing back-to-back flash sales. The next one we have is affiliate funnels. So funnels don't always have to promote your own products. If you don't have very many products yet, you can promote other people's products and earn a commission on the sale, or you can do this to supplement your income and your sales from your other funnels. If somebody clicks on your link and purchases through it, you're going to earn a commission if you join that affiliate program. When doing this, I recommend focusing on higher commission programs or those with recurring commissions. There's quite a lot of work that goes into creating an affiliate funnel, so you don't want to do it just for a few dollars per sale.

[00:09:53.140] - Leanne Chapman
So I would stick to affiliate programs where you earn a significant amount for each commission or you are receiving a recurring commission each month. So for example, if you're promoting somebody's membership, you might earn a commission every month the person stays in the membership. And if they stay in the membership for, say, two or three years, you're going to earn commission every single month for that period of time. And it really does add up. Here, you do something similar to setting up an evergreen funnel for your own product sales. You'd create a lead magnet that attracts the same audience, and then you place it on your blog post that are focused on promoting those products. Those posts might be product reviews, product comparisons, buying guides, how-to guides. And then readers of these articles are likely to be really interested in the product that you're promoting. In fact, to the point that they've actually gone and searched for a product review or a product comparison. So you're going to be advertising your lead magnet on these pages, knowing that it's going to attract the same person. Then you're going to send them through some warm-up emails.

[00:10:50.140] - Leanne Chapman
In these emails, you're not just warming somebody up to you as the expert, you're also introducing them to the products available. Then you proceed with your sales emails. For instance, you You might share case studies, research studies, comparisons with other popular products. You could address some FAQs or some common objections, essentially using a similar approach as promoting your own offers. Creating urgency in affiliate funnels can certainly be harder, but it's not impossible. It's a more advanced strategy. So if you're just getting started, then you might want to just create some of these funnels without urgency. However, you could create urgency by offering an extra bonus if they buy within a specific time frame, and then you can deliver that bonus if you can verify that they purchase soon after your email. You can usually just check this inside your email service provider. For example, I use Kit, which used to be Convert Kit, and I can click into somebody's email address and see when they last received the email, so I know whether they purchased within a funnel and I can offer them the bonus. Another way is to refer people to a freebie that locks in your affiliate cookies.

[00:11:56.740] - Leanne Chapman
So many affiliate programs, especially digital ones, offer freebies through affiliate links. So if you refer somebody to the freebie, you're still going to earn commission if they purchase later in the funnel period. So essentially somebody else is doing all the hard work setting up that funnel and all you're having to do is refer people to the free stuff. For brands with whom you have a strong affiliate relationship and have generated numerous sales, you could consider reaching out to see if they would offer your audience a discount code. This definitely is going to involve some work on their end. And if you want to use countdown timers on the offers page, then it's going to be a bit more work for them to set up. So I would usually reserve this for affiliate programs where you're doing really well and you think that the affiliate manager is going to want to really support you to continue to make more sales. Next, we have trigger funnels. So this is where you can send people into funnels once they're already subscribed to an email list based on their click behavior. So when you send newsletters, you might casually mention products linking to them.

[00:12:57.490] - Leanne Chapman
And when somebody clicks on those links, you can add a tag like, like interested in X product, which then triggers an automation sending them into a mini sales funnel. This funnel could include additional product information. It could include a case study, a bonus offer, encouraging them to make that purchase decision. For your own offers, you might want to use something like deadline funnel again to add that urgency and make it a bit more like an evergreen sales funnel we talked about earlier, but targeting people who've already shown an interest. This can be challenging to replicate for affiliate products, but it's not always necessary to do. I do recommend using a do not disturb tag when you set up these funnels. So when somebody enters the funnel, the tag gets added. This way, they won't receive other emails or newsletters because you can exclude them when you send a newsletter. This just ensures that they don't feel overwhelmed by too many emails at once. Then you can just set the automation to remove the tag once they travel through the sales sequence. They go back to receiving all your regular emails. Finally, we have sales page funnels.

[00:14:06.400] - Leanne Chapman
So these mini funnels function a bit like trip wires. So visitors to your sales page might arrive through, say, an email link or browsing your website, But then when they arrive on the sales page, a pop-up could offer them a discount if they opt in to your email list. So you could deliver the discount via a coupon code in the welcome email, though there is no reason to buy now with this method, so it doesn't always work quite effectively. Alternatively, you could use a tripwire page with a short time frame, like say 24 hours, and then you could follow up with a reminder email within that 24 hours. If you use Deadline Funnel, you can set up a proper funnel that includes urgency from the start. Essentially, it's just like an evergreen sales funnel, but it's triggered by somebody joining your email list, specifically to get a discount coupon. Creating funnels requires some tools, and which tool you need depends on which type of funnel you're planning to set up. Deadline Funnel is the best for adding urgency to longer funnels, such as evergreen or trigger funnels. Though it's an investment, it typically pays for itself many, many times over.

[00:15:16.430] - Leanne Chapman
For those who are just starting with lower-tick products, you may use something like HurryTimer, which is a free countdown plugin that works on WordPress, works absolutely fine for things like tripwire offers. For email service providers, I usually recommend Kit, formerly called Convert Kit, due to its excellent automation workflows, but most email service providers will allow you to set up these types of funnels. If you use tools like Elementor or Thrivecart, they offer built-in countdown timers for trip wires. I think with Elementor, it has to be the pro version in order to get the countdown Timer, but that's certainly an option. I also recommend Convertbox for doing the sales page discounts. They create visually appealing non-intrusive pop-ups, allowing you to control when and to whom the pop-up's display. So it's probably the best tool for creating those pop-up notifications to create sales page funnels. So which type of funnel should you be using? Well, this depends partly on your tools and also on your budget. Generally speaking, for low-ticket products, focus on trip wires and simple trigger funnels. For high-ticket products, such as those priced a few hundred dollars or more, an evergreen email funnel works really well as these involve a little bit more nurturing, which gives you an opportunity to sell something that costs a little bit more money.

[00:16:40.520] - Leanne Chapman
You can also set up trigger funnels, and you can also add urgency to those trigger funnels to really help boost conversion rates. And you can also do sales page funnels. For higher priced, say, group programs that are, say, four figures or more, an evergreen email funnel is going to be essential. Use Deadline Funnel for higher-priced trigger funnels as well to add urgency. You can also use trigger funnels and sales page funnels for your very high ticket products. And for affiliate products, you would consider using either affiliate or Trigger Funnel. So hopefully you found this talk about five types of passive income funnel useful and it sparked some ideas for you. I do have a free Funnel Guide, Fantastic Funnels, which you are able to download. It covers all five of the funnels that we talked today. Plus there is a workbook for you to start planning out some of your own funnels. Plus I've included the exact emails from one of my successful evergreen sales funnels. So you can see how I plan it out, how I nurture people towards making a sale. I also share a creative strategy every week with my email list for Strategy Sundays.
