Liz Stapleton [00:00:12]:
Alright, guys. I'm super excited to have a returning speaker today. She is a verified expert when it comes to Canva, and she's from Canada. I'm super excited that she's here to join us today, to share things about Canva organization because I know I always struggle to keep my Canva account organized. She helps lots of entrepreneurs figure this out to use Canva more effectively and efficiently, and she loves to help them tame the hot mess Canva accounts, which I am very familiar with. A big warm welcome to Brenda Cadman. Brenda, thank you so much for coming back.

Brenda Cadman [00:00:43]:
Oh, thanks for inviting me. I I was happy to do it.

Liz Stapleton [00:00:47]:
Yeah. So, and I know last year's session or I think it was last year when you shared about Canva organization, I learned a lot, and I got my Canva organized, and it wasn't such a hot mess. But, like, a year later, it's a hot mess again because I wasn't maintaining it. And plus Canva's just tweak things a little where it's like, wait a second. And part of part of that is is me not paying attention. That's the Canva..... I know. So I was hoping we can maybe discuss kind of if you at one point did get organized, how do you reset when you become disorganized?

Brenda Cadman [00:01:25]:
I it's a really important thing to do because even if you have maintained it maintained it, periodically, things shift in our businesses where it requires more than a a little bit of maintenance. It requires a total facelift, in terms of the structure that you have. And we can usually get a sense of when things are no longer quite as easy to put things away because suddenly it it feels like you're feeling a bit of friction there about where where does this go? I I don't even really need to keep this anymore, but I might need it. And, so I do think that periodically, you know, on a maybe an annual basis, it's worth reevaluating. Is my business the same? Am I doing the same thing? Am I working with the same kinds of clients? Is what I have right now still feeling fairly intuitive in terms of filing stuff away? And if it is, great. I'm not saying you have to change things. Yeah. But you need to you need to have that, a little bit of of awareness to determine, do I need to make some bigger changes here and carve some time out to do that? But in terms of just regular usage of it, I would say even if it's not time for that deep clean, if you're feeling, if that if you're falling behind in terms of staying on top of organizing your files, if it's just because you're not able to carve out the time to do it and it's about establishing a new habit, especially like you said, the layout has the interface has changed a little bit, and while functionally, it's not all that different, the packaging is different enough that it's there's a bit of a learning curve there again.

Brenda Cadman [00:02:56]:
Sure. So the reason you're not feeling organized and it's kind of delving into hot mess territory again is because it just is hard to carve the time out. That's one issue. But if you're finding it's hard to stay on top of the organization because there's no clear home for your files if every time you're going to file something away, it's like, I don't really know where this goes, but I feel like I have to put it away.

Liz Stapleton [00:03:41]:
Yeah.

Brenda Cadman [00:03:41]:
Then you do need to sit down and really reassess whether or not the structure you have works for you. I have found there's a lot of content that kind of maybe comes across my feed more than others because this is an area I'm really interested in. But I'll see content creators saying, here are the 5 folders everybody must have on Canva to organize their designs.

Brenda Cadman [00:03:42]:
Yeah. And it that's not true because there is no one size fits all solution. And if you try to use somebody else's organization structure to impose on your designs, it's not necessarily going to work. So it might feel like you've started to get organized, but it's really hard to finish that process or stay on top of it because it's just not the right folder structure. It's not a quick fix, but you have to evaluate whether you've got the right folders.

Liz Stapleton [00:04:09]:
So I think that is a big area that, like, my folder structure is just there's too many subfolders. There's too like, I just I forget where things I forget the folders I have. So if I need to clean up my folders, especially downsizing where I just have less folders and more general folders in a sense, What is the easiest way to do is there an easy way to do that?

Brenda Cadman [00:04:28]:
There's not necessarily an easy way. It really depends on how much content you have. If you have a small amount of content, then this is gonna be a faster process. But I would hazard to guess that you and most of the people watching this, it it's a lot of designs. It's a lot of images and brand assets that need to to have some sort of organization put to it. And you don't want to necessarily get rid of too many of your subfolders. You you do want to it's that balance between having enough detailed folders but not getting too granular because then all of a sudden you might have a folder that has 1 or 2 things in it, and it's just not necessary. But you also don't wanna have a folder that has a 100 things in it because then you're scrolling through it, still trying to find the thing that you're looking for, which falls into that same wasted time kind of category that you're gonna you're gonna find yourself in if you're using, Canva's homepage, which is just useless, really, as far as organization goes.

Brenda Cadman [00:05:26]:
So sitting down, I think the first there's a little bit of going back to the drawing board and and reviewing what am I actually creating. Am I working with clients? What sort of designs am I creating? I know bloggers may have a client base as well, or if they're strictly doing, blogging, they might have folders for social media. And, you might have a photos folder if you are if you listened to my tips last year, not using the uploads folder for for organizing your images. But I do think you need to start by reassessing what am I actually organizing and then try to figure out what are the big chunks and then what are some of these smaller chunks underneath that? If you are finding if you're finding it difficult to find the files because there's just too many subfolders, there's no shame in moving everything into a a a higher level folder, getting rid of all the subfolders, and reassessing what those subfolders should be. And sometimes, you know, they gotta pull everything out of the closet before you can put the organization into it so that it it's it's gonna get kind of messy, even messier before it can get better. And people are very resistant to that feeling because it feels like it's getting worse rather than getting better, but sometimes you gotta pull everything out in order to see what you've got. Purge what doesn't need to be there. That's often there's often a lot of old stuff that we're afraid to let it go up, and maybe you'll be ready to hit delete now, and then reassess what that folder structure should actually look like.

Brenda Cadman [00:06:55]:
So it's going back to the drawing board, but the second time around, you might have a probably a better sense of what what kind of folders you're actually gonna need.

Liz Stapleton [00:07:04]:
And use. Because I thought I used all these folders, but then it turns out that I don't actually use them.

Brenda Cadman [00:07:10]:
Yeah. You don't I I think it's tempting to create folders, anticipating how future you is actually going to use them and then future you comes around and realizes not actually gonna stick those files there, that's fine. There there's no you're not gonna get it perfect. There is no perfect in terms of creating an organization system. It is always going to change to suit your needs and the new kinds of content that you're creating. So don't resist that. I mean, feel free to, I don't need that folder anymore. Delete that.

Brenda Cadman [00:07:39]:
Create a new one, and it's going to change over time. And there's nothing wrong with that. At the end of the day, if you can find what you're looking for in an easy and quick manner, regardless of what that structure looks like, it's doing its job. But if you're feeling fresh any sort of friction, you need to reassess.

Liz Stapleton [00:07:58]:
Okay. I like that. And you should be able to bulk organize your files fairly easily in Canva. Assuming you have a pro account and you're doing multiple folders because, otherwise, this isn't a thing for you.

Brenda Cadman [00:08:09]:
Yeah. Yeah. I there's no, like, select all Yeah. Kind of feature, but you can click and drag. You can select multiple, and you can you can, click and drag to select multiple Okay. Which is gonna make it a lot faster to be able to then click on that little folder icon and move it into another folder.

Liz Stapleton [00:08:28]:
Okay. Yeah. I like that. Another area that I find gets cluttered, because, honestly, I'm not quite sure how it gets set up, is the sidebar when you're in a design because you've got it always starts out with, like, design, elements, text, brand, you know, those basics. But then you have a bunch of other stuff on there, which you can use, but somebody I'm like, why is that there? How did that get there? So how how does stuff end up there? I guess, is my first question. My next question is how often should you clean it out? And

Brenda Cadman [00:08:59]:
So this is this is actually in the editor itself in that object.

Liz Stapleton [00:09:03]:
I can share my screen if you want me to show you You

Brenda Cadman [00:09:04]:
know what? Why don't we why don't we do a screen share? Because I I can envision it, but I know not everybody's in there Yeah. Yeah. Every day, all day.

Liz Stapleton [00:09:13]:
Okay. So can you see my screen? Okay. So I just opened up a random design. But so I have Yes. Here's this stuff. But then there's so much more stuff, and I don't even and also, like, my I don't think my logos are even in the right place, if I'm being honest. Yeah. Oh, no.

Liz Stapleton [00:09:31]:
They are there. Well no. But now it says go to brand see, I'm confused.

Brenda Cadman [00:09:34]:
Yeah. These are so all of these have been opened at one point, and you haven't gotten rid of them. So they have just remained there. So I would recommend doing a full on purge of this. I'll tell you personally. Again, there's no one size fits all response. How I work is not necessarily what will work for other people. But I clear that out on the regular where the default ones are the only ones showing at just so because I like a nice clean surface, and you can get rid of them by hovering.

Brenda Cadman [00:10:01]:
If you hover over them. Uh-huh. You and you should see it. There should be an x that shows up. Now if you click on just click on it. There you go. So you have to go through each of them, click on it, select it, and hit the x and x all of them out. So what you're seeing down at the bottom is I'm seeing a a collection here of old apps that maybe would have opened opened at one point.

Brenda Cadman [00:10:23]:
I'm seeing a whole lot of custom folders. And once you have opened the custom folder, it kinda stays there pinned so you can access it. Okay. But if you don't stay on top of that, you're gonna have a whole you know, it it's it's basically the Canva equivalent of a browser with 3 bazillion tabs open. So

Liz Stapleton [00:10:42]:
Okay. So that's Oh, I recognize that. But you're saying as soon as I, like, open something, if I go to, like, my is it projects and I open a file or folder?

Brenda Cadman [00:10:52]:
If you open one of your folders there, it's gonna append it there.

Liz Stapleton [00:10:56]:
So does this show up there now?

Brenda Cadman [00:10:57]:
Probably probably down at the where if you've opened it before Way down. Okay. Way down at the bottom. So I would clear those out. You don't have to do that all the time. I don't do that every single time that I work in Canva, but that is something that I try to stay on top of. Now I have the added, motivation in that I do record Canva tutorials on a regular basis, and I don't want everybody seeing all my business. So I do

Liz Stapleton [00:11:23]:
Sure. Have to

Brenda Cadman [00:11:23]:
clean that

Liz Stapleton [00:11:24]:
out regularly. Okay.

Brenda Cadman [00:11:25]:
But it it's nice to just have that as a clear space as well so that if I do open a folder and I wanna be able to easily find it, that I'm not scrolling and scrolling.

Liz Stapleton [00:11:34]:
Yeah. So then yeah. I'm like, wait a second. Where'd it go? Because it does get really long. And I was like, how did they even end up here? So okay. Yeah. I would I would

Brenda Cadman [00:11:42]:
get rid of everything down to, apps there. So so or keep everything from the top to apps, and then everything below that is something that it's opened because you engage with it.

Liz Stapleton [00:11:54]:
Okay. Okay. Wow. Yeah. Okay. Now that makes sense. I was just like, when I was because, like, I tend to I'm not in Canva all the time. Like, I it's very, like,

Liz Stapleton [00:12:10]:
spurts

Liz Stapleton [00:12:11]:
of I'm in a lot for a little while, and then I'm not in it at all for a while. So that's alright. Okay. Alrighty. So another thing I've kinda noticed I would love to get kind of your thoughts on is for the longest time, I would just you know, I'd go to share. I'd go to download. I'd download it to my computer, whatever folder what not. And I've recently and it would download a zip folder if it was multiple things.

Liz Stapleton [00:12:38]:
Right? And then you had to open the zip and whatever. Yep. So I've recently played around with downloading directly to Dropbox, which does not result in a zip file. But then if I actually wanna open it on my computer, it's gotta like, it takes a second because it's like, I can't just move it from my Dropbox to something because I have to have actually opened it on my computer. So I'm curious kind of what your thoughts are on the various different save options and, you know, make sure that stays organized as well because there's this has this has expanded quite a lot in the over the years.

Brenda Cadman [00:13:11]:
So It has.

Liz Stapleton [00:13:13]:
Thoughts, advice, tips.

Brenda Cadman [00:13:16]:
I I'm a big I'm a big fan of just sticking with the basics. There's every possible option and integration there, and they they wanna be able to provide that if you need it. But the, really, the only features that I'm using as far as sharing and downloading is I'm doing a straight download to my computer. And then as soon as I'm done with it, I'm trying to clear up that downloads folder on a regular basis. I mean, we have all these different collection buckets, whether it's in your email or on your computer or in your Dropbox or in your Google Drive or in Canva. And and it's it I do think there's a lot of value in just carving out on your calendars a dedicated half hour once a week to just do cleanup, just to clear the things out, either file it away if you are gonna need it again. But a lot of the stuff we're downloading from Canva, we just need it temporarily for uploading to social media or to add as a featured image to a blog post, and we don't need to hang on to it on the computer. So staying on top of clearing it out of wherever we've downloaded it to is is an important part.

Brenda Cadman [00:14:20]:
But, honestly, I whether I'm pretty much only downloading them, occasionally, I'm sharing it, say, saving it as a brand template or I'm grabbing a template link to share the file directly as a Canva template. But I don't tend to save it into other, other programs. There is some value if you have a lot of content and you're wanting to maybe share or save copies into Dropbox or some other, storage system that you've got an integration with. But I think a typical user just needs to for the most part, they're downloading it whether it's a PDF or, it as a PNG or JPEG file. They use it, and then they're done with it. And they just need to delete it and then know that the original is here, so they need to come back and get it. Because, well, otherwise, what happens is you download it. You end up making changes to the file in Canva, then you download it again, and then you have this collection of multiple versions.

Brenda Cadman [00:15:14]:
You don't know which is which. I mean, you can go by the edited date, but it it just ends up piling up as they download it, use it, and get it out of there.

Liz Stapleton [00:15:25]:
Okay. And I just wanna confirm, this saved the folders to your Canva folders. So this this is where Yeah. You could organize things from inside the design if you want.

Brenda Cadman [00:15:35]:
You you can. But, honestly, what I find easier is what's more intuitive is just go back to the projects page, refresh it when you've been working, and then anything that's appearing, I would and the first thing you actually should do, if you go back if you scroll back to the top, there's filters at the top here and where it says owner. Mhmm. Change that to just show yours because, otherwise, how project works is a little it's not as intuitive as it should be. And I do believe we're gonna see some improvements on this and, you know, in the next in the coming months. But this what happens is if you have owner selected often, you will have things filed away, but they won't actually file away into the folder. It kind of surfaces up these old files. It's also acting more like a search function than than a filing system.

Brenda Cadman [00:16:26]:
If you change it to show your your actual account name, then and the designs that appear under, on this page under designs, these are things that need to be foldered. These are things that need to be put away. So I often get asked, how do I know what I haven't put into a folder? You go to your projects page. You look what's under designs.

Liz Stapleton [00:16:48]:
Mhmm. What's under your folder if it's actually in a folder. Right?

Brenda Cadman [00:16:51]:
If if it's already in the folder, you won't see it as a loose individual title on there. You'll it'll be in the folder already. So all of these things here, if it's not in the folder, all of the individual designs on this page, those all need to be, those all need to be put into folders. Yeah. Yeah. Delete it or archive. There is no judgment there. That is just how to identify them.

Liz Stapleton [00:17:17]:
I mentioned it became a big mess again. Are you like?

Brenda Cadman [00:17:21]:
But I'm in work with you because there's a lot of stuff here. You know what? And it could be a simple you know, if you're like, okay. I know I need to organize this stuff. I don't have the time to deal with it right now. I just wanna have a nice clean surface. There's nothing wrong with doing a drag and select and moving all of this into a, you know, to be organized folder or a temporary folder. Yeah. So you can at least get some sort of clear surface moving forward and then tackle it in smaller chunks.

Brenda Cadman [00:17:48]:
And part of that tackling and maybe going through and saying, I don't need any of these than just deleting them and getting them out of there because there's no point filing stuff that you don't need.

Liz Stapleton [00:17:57]:
Yeah. Okay. No. I like that.

Brenda Cadman [00:18:01]:
Alrighty.

Liz Stapleton [00:18:04]:
Any other tips? Because I know so we talked about this, how the, the way Canva looks has changed a lot lately. The layout's the same thing. But stylistically, it looks different. Any tips It does. And there is

Brenda Cadman [00:18:18]:
yeah. And there's one new thing here. This this starred section here on the left hand side

Liz Stapleton [00:18:27]:
Don't know what I that you

Brenda Cadman [00:18:28]:
you So you you have starred some of your folders and which is not a bad thing And I'll tell you how I'm using this personally right now because one of the things I've got done away with, not even I believe it was before the glow up interface rolled out. There used to be kind your your file hierarchy where you could see all of your folders on the left hand side. You could pull the file into it. That got removed, I think, as an experiment, and I'm hoping that'll be fixed. But in the meantime, I'm using this star feature to be able to kinda create half my own sort of file structure there. So I have I have, 12 or 13 top level folders, and I have starred all of those so that they appear under your star so that if I'm working, you know, on, if I'm just navigating around, it's easier for me to jump back into the folders without having go to go back to the main projects page. Now you can you can move them from here.

Liz Stapleton [00:19:30]:
That makes it easier to be like, well, okay. Let me at least get in the top level and out of the way.

Brenda Cadman [00:19:35]:
Exactly. At least there's some steps towards that. And then, additionally, when this was first rolled out under your star, you couldn't reorder them, so you'd have to really strategically star them in so they'd appear in the order. But now you can Okay. You can drag the order. And if you click on the little plus sign next to your starred, you can also create a section that you can hold starred items. So maybe you have multiple folders you're working on for clients that you wanna be able to access. You can reorder those as well.

Brenda Cadman [00:20:03]:
I personally, so like I said, I have all my top level folders starred. And then at the top, I have a section that is kind of a time sensitive area. So I'm working on a lot of affiliate graphics for Black Friday right now. I'm working on my own affiliate Our Black Friday content. So I've got a little Black Friday section at the top. And then when I'm done with that, I'll remove this section out of your star because I don't need it anymore. But the top level folders, I still keep there for my just ease of access. It's more like it's more like bookmarking.

Liz Stapleton [00:20:35]:
Yeah.

Brenda Cadman [00:20:35]:
Or favoriting than it is, anything else. It's a step I think we'll see improvements here, but for now, this is what you're working with.

Liz Stapleton [00:20:48]:
Yeah. Alright. Any other sort of tips or, you know, if things you've seen people struggle with with the kind of new look that, you know, has helped them to kinda get used to it or use it? I

Brenda Cadman [00:20:59]:
mean, the reality is that most of nothing that it pertains to organization. I think there's there's 2 you have to figure out there's 2 2 different kinds of concerns that come out of the glow up interface. One is this looks different. It's uncomfortable. Things have moved around, and it takes time to get used to it. Now I've I've had the benefit of additional time to get used to this because I've had it since early May before it was rolled out even in its earliest form.

Brenda Cadman [00:21:33]:
So I've had months to get used to it, and it really is second nature to me now since I'm also in here every damn day. But so the part of it is, okay, how much of this is the learning curve and it I will get used to it. And how much is they changed something? It has slowed things down. It is it is negatively impacted my workflow because of the changes that they have made. Those are the items you need to tell Canva, and you will see in the lower left corner of your screen, there's a little glow up icon there. If you click on it, there's an option there to submit feedback. They are paying attention to that. I know it feels sometimes like you're screaming into the void when there are changes that you don't like, but I promise they are.

Brenda Cadman [00:22:14]:
It doesn't mean that they will necessarily change everything that you want to see changed. But if you see a problem, tell them tell them specifically where the problem what problems you're encountering and how it is negatively impacting what you're trying to do. There's a lot of people who are just saying, I don't like it. Change it back. Well, can Canva can't do anything with that. They're not going to, but they can refine features. That also doesn't tell them what specifically you don't like. And, you know, if if we're creating

Liz Stapleton [00:22:46]:
Period. Like, that they're not gonna they're not gonna just change it back. I remember when we had to shift to Canva 2.0. That was rough because your design studio

Brenda Cadman [00:22:57]:
Exactly. You had, like, completely ridiculous. That was a big change. But we get used we we we don't like change, and then we adapt. But I admit I will be the first to say there are things that change that got rolled out as part of this interface change that were not great in terms of it really felt clunky and slowed things down. Like, opening like, the editing panel started to open on the right side of the the screen instead. So if you were changing colors or fonts, it was that panels opening on the the right. There was a lot of pushback and a lot of people saying, please put it back on the left.

Brenda Cadman [00:23:30]:
That's what we're used to. That's what works for our work flow and explain how it was slowing it down. And to their credit, they very quickly change that back, but they need to have that specific actionable feedback. If if we just say to somebody, I don't like it, I'll know I I like you know? Yeah. I'll I'll I'll know what I like when I see it. There's nothing they can do with that. Yeah. So

Liz Stapleton [00:23:54]:
is there any Yeah. Is there anything that you can kind of customize within this workspace for yourself to make it easier? I'm just if I'm just curious. I don't know that there is. But beyond your star No.

Brenda Cadman [00:24:06]:
Beyond the start and, you know, just creating those creating those folders is just incredibly important. The stay off the I would really strongly advise stay off the home page version of that home landing tab because it's all the most recent files. There's nothing it's just pure overwhelm,

Liz Stapleton [00:24:24]:
which I do feel better than what they used to have where it was, like, all the different things you can make.

Brenda Cadman [00:24:29]:
It was it was, like, more detail add to it. It is better. This is better. It's in-depth now. It's just all these quick start, options and then all your files. But if you're looking for something specific, unless it's one of the last couple of designs that you've been working on, it still becomes very overwhelming. So I would say get into a habit of going to the project section as your default and working from there. Because once you just have a set of a simple set of folders I don't know.

Brenda Cadman [00:24:58]:
Is there any benefit in seeing what I've got in terms of,

Liz Stapleton [00:25:02]:
Yeah.

Brenda Cadman [00:25:02]:
Sure. Let me actually If you want to give me sharing, I will, Yep.

Liz Stapleton [00:25:08]:
Alright. I think you should have it now.

Brenda Cadman [00:25:12]:
Okay. And I will refresh that. I will share my screen. Just

Liz Stapleton [00:25:17]:
You can see what a professional organized Canva looks fine.

Brenda Cadman [00:25:22]:
So you can see how I've got all my top level folders are all you starred over here, and then I've got Black Friday, which is a section I'm working on up here. Those, and that's just time sensitive, and I'll delete that when I'm done with it. But this is all that I have on projects. There's no loose designs or images or videos here because they're all in folders. But you'll see if I again, if I change it, it it goes to any owner that's going to change. Suddenly, you're gonna have a lot of stuff that gets burped up here from sometimes the distant past. Mhmm. So you do wanna make sure that if you are a solo, Canva user that you are, just just change that to show your own file, and then it'll stay nice and neatly filed away.

Brenda Cadman [00:26:07]:
But by coming here as my starting point, if I'm looking for something you know, if if I'm looking for the last couple of things I worked on, I'll just grab it from the carousel at the top. But if I am looking for a presentation design or something else that I created some time ago, I'm gonna immediately be able to start drilling down from that top level. And then you can see I've got subfolders for presentations for me. It makes sense to break it down, on a time basis. Whereas if I'm, you know, looking for courses, those are broken down by the course name or the course or the function. So if this is what works for me and what works for somebody else will be totally different, and that's okay. There is no one size. It's all solution.

But I would encourage you to go through and get to the point where you just have these folders at the top. It feels manageable. You don't wanna have 40 different folders at the top here, or you're, again, still gonna be scrolling through trying to find what you're looking for. You'd wanna minimize the number of choices. And a good way of thinking about it could be, like, a bit like, navigating a website. If you're looking at a website, you don't have if you have 3 gazillion options in your website navigation, it's hard to find anything because it's just sheer overwhelm. But if you have these kind of top level categories that are descriptive enough that you know what you're gonna find, but they're general enough that allows for you to expand content underneath them, then that's kind of the sweet spot that you're looking for. And I'd be fine about 12 to 13 is good.

And you can see if I had too many more, I would start to have to scroll in order to see them in the starting section.

Got it. I like that. Alright. Thank you so much for sharing that. Okay. So I think we're about out of time. I know you have some excellent, resources and stuff for attendees. If you can just share a little bit about that.

Brenda Cadman [00:27:57]:
Sure. So, I have the Canva organization road map, which started out as kind of a PDF guide. And I I think there's a tendency, and I'm in this camp as well, to download PDF with the best of intentions to review them, and then they just disappear into your your downloads folder. So that's been revamped to a, like, a 5 minute training to give you 5 5 step process on how to attack your your clutter in Canva for the first time or maybe not for the first time. And there's a little worksheet that goes with that as well.

If you have any questions for Brenda, don't hesitate to go sign up for her list. Go follow her on social. Ask her those questions. She always sends out super helpful emails, like, every single week. I love getting her emails. So if you aren't on her list and you wanna be better with Canva or just using Canva like I said, I'm on her list. I'm not super organized, but I still am always learning from her. So, definitely, go sign up for her list.

Liz Stapleton [00:28:52]:
And, Brenda, thank you so much for for sharing all this today.
