[00:00:13.310] - Meagan
Hi, everyone. My name is Meagan Williamson and welcome to my Summit presentation on all things Pinterest for bloggers. I'm so so excited that you're watching my presentation today, and I hope that it's going to be an action hacked 25 to 30 minutes now. Like I said, my name is Meagan Williamson, so that is like Meagan, but not so Megan, like Meagan is something that I learned to say over the years. And I'm a Pinterest marketing expert and certified business coach. Now, I'm also really excited to share with you that I'm actually a Pinterest creator coach.

[00:00:46.680] - Meagan
So, I work alongside a Pinterest and help them to share best practices for bloggers or creators using the platform. Now we all know that there was an incredible amount of changes in 2020, 2021. And I'm going to be sharing some of those things, the observations and the knowledge that I have with you. And I want you to be rest assured that because I am a partner with Pinterest and one of their creator coaches, as well as an independent Pinterest marketing educator, I'm going to be sharing with you best practices from the platform.

[00:01:19.520] - Meagan
What I know is somebody who has seen all the accounts and also things that I've learned over the past eight years working intimately with my favorite search engine platform. So, a little bit about me, I actually started out as a blogger myself in 2010.

[00:01:37.590] - Meagan
It's been a lot longer than that. And at that time, I started a DIY and a core blog, and I figured out very very quickly that I was getting a lot of traffic from people pinning my content to Pinterest. I actually went viral overnight and it was incredible. And what ended up happening is that I started racking up a ton of followers. So, Pinterest loved on me, showed my account to a lot of people, and very quickly I gained over 100,000 followers on Pinterest.

[00:02:06.070] - Meagan
So, when that type of thing happens, if you're new to blogging or you've been doing it for a while, you know, that when you sort of get a lot of people following you, people start to say, hey, Meagan, can you teach me about how to use Pinterest for my blog? Or even businesses were reaching out to me and asking me if I could help them leverage, print and trust for their business or blog or part of my brand. And at that time, of course, I had the whole like, I don't know, like I know what worked for me.

[00:02:34.840] - Meagan
I actually have a background in school and child psychology. And so what I did was I did my due diligence and I figured out that what I needed to do to feel comfortable teaching Pinterest to other people as a side hustle was to figure out what worked for other accounts beyond just me.

[00:02:54.140] - Meagan
I'm going to be honest and say that as a creator, as somebody who makes their livelihood, or even as a side hustle or as a part time gig that you create content online. It's sort of like your shoe in it. All the platforms are going to love you because you're invested in creating high quality content. So, trying to make an account that wasn't a blogger or somebody who was a storyteller full time was tricky. I spent a year getting to know the platform and what worked for different people.

[00:03:22.910] - Meagan
And I began taking on Pinterest management clients and helping other business owners, bloggers, I would manage their accounts so that they could gain traffic and visibility with the platform. So that's how I got to where I am today. I now work full time as a Pinterest marketing educator.

[00:03:39.170] - Meagan
I run workshops. I run a Pinterest marketing membership. It's the largest in the world. I'm very proud of that. And I work with a lot of creators just like you.

[00:03:47.200] - Meagan
Okay, so, that aside, I know my stuff, and today we're going to be talking about and I know like, I don't spend a lot of time in Facebook groups because I find they're a bit of a drag on my energy. But what I do do is listen to my audience. And I know a lot of bloggers and creators have felt very, you know saddened or overwhelmed or frustrated with a lot of changes that we've seen out of Pinterest. So towards the end of the beginning of 2020. So, June of 2020, we saw idea Pins, or maybe it was in 2019.

[00:04:21.530] - Meagan
It's been a while idea pins were rolled out. They were formerly called story pins. They were tested out in the UK. Then we saw them come to the US, and what we saw is actually with that was this change towards multiformat content on the platform. And around that same time, we saw some massive algorithm changes in the fall of 2020.

[00:04:42.070] - Meagan
And a lot of people saw a significant drop in their impressions, monthly views and people seeing their content. And since that time, we've seen a bunch of changes. So, we've seen numbers drop. We've seen the importance of what we're calling fresh pins or fresh content. And then the concept or format of an idea Pin has advanced greatly.

[00:05:07.540] - Meagan
Now, if you've been living under a rock and you're thinking, Meagan, what is that idea pins are, a multi media, so you can use pictures and videos format. It's supposed to be dynamic storytelling that engages your audience in the platform. So, let's decode that. What does that mean?

[00:05:25.660] - Meagan
We have been trained to think that Pinterest has always been a traffic driver as a search engine. So if you're a newer blogger, you might be thinking, well, isn't it like Instagram or Facebook? Absolutely not. This platform is actually much more like Google or YouTube. So, it helps connect people with your content with your ideas, with your inspiring story for months and years to come.

[00:05:50.200] - Meagan
So, it's not just like pushing something out on Instagram stories and expires 24 hours later or even something. We know that the average lifespan of an Instagram post or a Facebook post is about one to two days. Whereas as a search engine, Pinterest wants to take your content, label it or index it, right, so that's that it can connect it to the right people at the right time. And that's the way they describe it. So, what that means is they index your content, they decide who it is relevant for, and they try to connect their user base with your content or your ideas.

[00:06:27.090] - Meagan
Of course, I always have a little itch here. This only ever happens when you're running workshops that your nose gets itchy. Now, so, as a search engine, it can give back to you for ages. But what we've seen is the shift away from being known as a traffic driving platform. And I know as a blogger you're saying, yeah, but Meagan, that's why I want to use it.

[00:06:47.230] - Meagan
But I want to share with you how things have evolved. So, Pinterest has gone all in on idea Pins, and that's what I was joking about. If you've been living under a rock and you don't know what an idea Pin is. Idea pins have become basically paramount to your success on Pinterest because Pinterest has gone all in and what it wants to do is encourage bloggers and creators. They use the term creator. I know that the focus of the summit is focusing on the term blogger, but as a platform, they wanted to provide a way for creators to share their content and their ideas without having to ask people to leave.

[00:07:25.550] - Meagan
Now, this has been really upsetting to a lot of people who make their income from ads on their website. And we have been traditionally trained that Pinterest is a traffic driver. Now it is becoming more social. And as the user base gets younger, which it has. And as other platforms evolve and change, Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, Snapchat all the platforms.

[00:07:50.610] - Meagan
Pinterest is no different. And let's just get real. Like as your social media marketing business coach for the time period of the duration of this workshop, things have changed an incredible amount across the landscape of social media. So, Instagram announced we're no longer an image sharing platform. YouTube brought out shorts when we used to go to YouTube for long fat format videos.

[00:08:14.470] - Meagan
So, Pinterest is no different. They're evolving with the people who are using it. So, if you're like, well, I'm on my soapbox here and I'm not using them, then it's not going to work for you. If you don't have that positive mindset and you don't want to shift with where the platform is going and where the people who use the platform, how they engage with content, then you're just not going to get love from the platform. So, I'm here to share some of the ways that you can get loved on by the platform.

[00:08:42.220] - Meagan
I want you to keep an open mindset and think about it in a holistic way. So, it's not possible for you to just share idea pins and have the growth that you used to have. Maybe you make a lot of video content or you make a lot of content for other platforms like Instagram or Facebook. I want you to think about how you can repurpose your content in a purposeful way for Pinterest to help reach more people, to increase your visibility and then think about that next step about how you could turn it into traffic.

[00:09:13.920] - Meagan
Now, we're not going to get anywhere if we're going to engage in really dissing and being negative and just dumping on the platform.

[00:09:21.870] - Meagan
I don't want that here. Let's keep it a positive space. Let's keep it on what we can do, what we can control. So, I'm going to actually share my screen with you. So, you can see here that I'm logged in on desktop. And we can see all sorts of things in my feed.

[00:09:38.810] - Meagan
Okay, so if we go to the Today tab. The Today tab is a wonderful place where it's going to provide today's inspiration. I really love going to the Today tab to see what is happening and what's popular. If you click on this, you can see they've curated some beautiful fashion. Amazing. Now this is a zero waste holiday craft.

[00:10:02.210] - Meagan
They know that this is coming up and what you can see in front of me is a collection of different pins. So, we have standard pins. So, look at this homemade potpourri , smells like Christmas morning. Over here, you can see that we have what's called an idea pin.

[00:10:17.490] - Meagan
So, this is easy, free and sustainable holiday door decor. You can see it's a beautiful video showing us how to make a holiday decor. We have a nice, beautiful call to action at the end here. So, what I want to point out to you is that there's a variety of pins. We have standard.

[00:10:34.190] - Meagan
We actually have quite a few standard pins here. So, we have standard pins. We have idea pins. We don't see any video pins. So, let's go back maybe to my feed and see if we can see some video pins.

[00:10:46.970] - Meagan
Now I just like to point them out because so, here's somebody who's taken a TikTok and turned it into a 1 minute video pin. Okay. So, you can see she has lots of reactions on this. This is interesting. Her TikTok watermark is there so you can see there's.

[00:11:06.880] - Meagan
Oh, my goodness. I love that they're like. So, what I wanted to show you was the three main types of pins. And what's important for you as a creator is I think a lot of bloggers traditionally think about, well, I can't drive traffic with idea pins. So, if we go to an idea pin, so here's a single story idea pin.

[00:11:27.890] - Meagan
You can see that there's no way for us to link to find more information. But know that as a creator, you're going to be getting access if you don't already to special features on the platform. Now I know we might be having people watching from all over the world, so it's going to be very different whether you're based in the US, the UK, Canada, or different parts of Europe or Asia. We get access to features at different times. But there is now a creator hub on mobile for people who have been identified as creators.

[00:11:59.320] - Meagan
I have it myself, log in and see if you have access. And what I want to share with you is that Idea Pins actually are going to have the ability to link to products. It is rather glitchy as well as affiliate links, so you can monetize your Idea Pins. Now, I'm not sure I don't have the official word from Pinterest, but I do have an inkling that they will eventually allow us to tell people where they can find more information. Thank goodness for technology.

[00:12:31.110] - Meagan
Sometimes life necessitates that you need to take a break because your pets need you, your kids need you. And that's what I love about working online. So, let's jump back into what you need to know about Pinterest this year. So, we already talked about the type of Pin formats.

[00:12:47.040] - Meagan
We know that Idea Pins do not have links currently as a destination link, but you can put product links and affiliate links. As I said, I do think that may evolve. We'll see what happens. That's just a hunch that I have due to feedback being shared. That said, the function of Idea Pins is to keep people in the platform.

[00:13:08.750] - Meagan
Now, if you want to have a look, you can actually look at the Pinterest Creators account. So, if you go to Pinterest creators, they have a wonderful account that will actually show you examples of Idea Pins for creators that they're working with. And this is where you can find information about the creator's hub. You can actually see Creators 101. So ,trends, you know all these different audience insights, pin stats.

[00:13:39.750] - Meagan
A lot has changed. And as I said, the social media landscape has changed so much that we really have to reframe how we look at, how we use Pinterest as a channel to get the word out. So, what I want to encourage you to do is to really think about how as a creator or a blogger that you can adapt and change instead of engaging in a negative cycle of what you don't like about it. You can share your feedback on their community boards, but the reality, they're bulletin boards.

[00:14:15.890] - Meagan
But the reality is that they've gone all in on Idea Pins.

[00:14:19.740] - Meagan
This is where they are going. They're not changing, that they have spent a huge amount of time and money on doing this. And what they're going to do is lean into the creators who are actually adopting the usage of Idea Pins. So, as a Pinterest strategist, when they first came out, I was like these are really cool, but how are we going to use them to our advantage? I always think about how you can leverage these types of things to help grow your visibility.

[00:14:45.290] - Meagan
So, what I want you to do is to reframe how you think about Pinterest. So, Pinterest isn't going to be just a traffic driving platform anymore, right? That's gone. That's Pinterest 1.0. Pinterest has changed. It's changed with the people.

[00:15:00.960] - Meagan
It's changed as it has evolved, it's become a more video friendly platform. I think we all felt that that was going to take a long time, and now it's here. And we see that people are actually staying in the app longer. They're engaging with the content, and this is the landscape. This is the future of Pinterest.

[00:15:21.330] - Meagan
This is the future of a lot of platforms. Their desire is to keep people in app engaging. And so, people need to find your content be served by your story. Learn about what you share with the world. So, no matter whether you come from food or fashion or beauty or DIY or education, that you are a unique original creator and that you're going to share ideas.

[00:15:45.650] - Meagan
Now, the but that I have is that it's also your responsibility to rise to the occasion to consider how you can continue to use Pinterest to drive visibility, to drive engagement, how you can make that part of your media pack. So, when brands want to work with you that you can share your amazing reach that you have on the platform. So that is your monthly views like how many people are actually seeing your content, how many people engage with your content and save it? And remember when people save your content, that's like a snowball effect.

[00:16:18.830] - Meagan
So, it's the gift that keeps on giving.

[00:16:21.210] - Meagan
And what we're seeing is the people who are open and receptive are being rewarded, so they're getting huge visibility, but they're always providing that next step. If you want to learn more, this is what you can do. Follow me on another platform or head to this blog post. Now there is some Gray zone about whether you can use that to learn more on my blog. Pinterest was really encouraging creators to not ask people to leave to get the full story.

[00:16:49.600] - Meagan
So, what I encourage you to do is to get creative with your content and think about how you can give a piece of the story and then encourage them if they want to learn more, to check you out, to follow you. And then you're going to be engaging in a practice where you're going to be publishing regular, fresh content. So, gone are the days where you can just share the same ten blog posts over and over and over again. And really what you want to do is to be contributing to the machine.

[00:17:15.280] - Meagan
So, it is a machine, right? It's a platform that rewards creators who are showing up and feeding its system with more and more and more knowledge just the same way that Google loves you when you become an authority in a particular niche or industry or domain area.

[00:17:31.620] - Meagan
Right? So, I want you to really think about that and think about how with that content that is going to be your vehicles for driving action. And that action is going to be inviting them to go to your website, signing up for your email list, following you on another channel like YouTube or Instagram. And you want to think about Pinterest as part of your ecosystem. So, it allows you to diversify your traffic and not become reliant on just Instagram, just YouTube, just Pinterest or just your SEO because we can't change when things change on these different platforms, right?

[00:18:08.180] - Meagan
There's so much that's out of our control. But what you can do is host your most valuable content on your website and always bring things back.

[00:18:16.440] - Meagan
That if people like you. If they loved your idea pins to make sure that they follow you SEO, what I teach in my own programs and the people that I meet is that you should use idea pins to give people a taste of your content, to inspire them, to engage them through original video, original ideas, quick basic concepts. And then what you're going to do is you're going to grow your visibility by regularly publishing high quality idea pins, and then you're going to be putting out your regular content, your regular content marketing plan. And those are going to become vehicles for your standard pins or static pins and video pins.

[00:18:57.900] - Meagan
Now I'm going to give you a little insider scoop that video pins are still a capability as of the end of 2021. But heading into 2022, we might see them disappear or change into something else. Continue to use them while you can. We are going to be encouraged to put all video in our idea pins.

[00:19:14.870] - Meagan
Okay. So, for now, I want you to think about how video pins, an idea or standard pins or static pins will be your traffic drivers. So, you're going to use action oriented language. This is where if they see one of your idea pins, if they come to your feed, if they open up one of your boards, you're going to really lean heavily into using that standard content to drive action to your website. Your idea pins are going to be used for visibility and creating brand awareness and getting in front of your ideal reader or person who you want to see your products.

[00:19:50.130] - Meagan
If you're an affiliate or you sell products on your blog or website. And you want to use video pins while you can for visibility as well. Now, I know that on mobile, it is harder to click through, but it's not impossible. And the people that want to find your blog, that want to subscribe to your email list are still going to do that. But it's your responsibility as a storyteller to make sure you're extending that invitation. So, I talk a lot about using call to actions or call to values and making it super clear.

[00:20:21.500] - Meagan
Now what we've noticed is there's been a huge shift in how the machine learning and AI technology indexes content.

[00:20:28.940] - Meagan
So, these are some tips for you to make sure that you are really getting the most out of the platform. So, one you're going to want to show up consistently and you are going to think about what consistent means to you. So, the technology is smart enough that it will set a cadence or consistency for your account. So, say goodbye to like you should be doing X amount of pins or this of your own this of others. You're going to lean heavily into your own content.

[00:20:59.220] - Meagan
You're going to lean heavily into being original. So, your own messaging, your own. Take your own story, your own unique angle. Nobody wants you to pretend to be somebody you aren't. Okay. You are going to think about how you are going to do as many idea pins as possible to create visibility. And at the same time, you're going to engage in a holistic, high value content marketing strategy.

[00:21:23.650] - Meagan
That means that you're going to show up and share that new blog content to Pinterest on a regular basis. Now I get asked a lot. Can I use something like Tailwind? Can I use the Pinterest scheduler? Tailwind does have API.

[00:21:35.930] - Meagan
It is the most robust Pinterest scheduler out there, but there has been a lot of changes. You know there's been different complaints and gossip about Tailwind. What I want you to think about is what do you need to put in place to allow you to be consistent on the platform. So, if you want to set your schedule and walk away from it, then something like Tailwind will be really helpful. The Pinterest scheduler is great, but it only allows you to schedule two weeks at a time.

[00:22:02.720] - Meagan
I love, love, love, using manual pinning and the Pinterest scheduler. If you have lower volume content. Now, if you're more advanced and you do this as a full time gig, it will have its limitations. It gets harder and idea pins can be quite time consuming. Again, I want you to think about how you can repurpose your content in a purposeful way.

[00:22:24.770] - Meagan
So, thinking about the other vehicles for content. Where else are you creating video? So, are you making Instagram reels? Are you making Instagram stories? Tiktok?

[00:22:34.350] - Meagan
Are you do regular live video or YouTube videos? And could you edit those down and remove the watermarks and upload it to Pinterest? Now Pinterest knows that one use content is a hard sell, so they want you to think about how you can create content. And again, think about your workflow. What does that look like and then have it you know work for each platform. Now remember that some of the things that work on Instagram don't necessarily work on Pinterest, so adapt your content in a purposeful way.

[00:23:04.830] - Meagan
Remember people on Pinterest like fast, super helpful concise. And remember they're often looking for that basic tutorial. So, you might have this desire to make it super advanced, super complex. That is potentially enough content for ten idea pins versus one. Don't over complicate it.

[00:23:24.230] - Meagan
Now when you think about that plan, so you're working on your visibility, you're creating regular, fresh content. You can create pins for preexisting content for the upcoming seasons, and I encourage you to do that. But remember, there's this level of freshness. So, gold standard is new URL, new images, silver or the next down. The next tier is old preexisting URL new image, and then bronze is your preexisting content preexisting pins.

[00:23:53.780] - Meagan
Those are going to continue to die off and lose steam. So, they just aren't valued as much on Pinterest, and we don't want to engage in any repetitive pinning practices. So, think about how you can be consistent. Think about how you can begin to make idea pins part of your workflow? How you can invite your people to follow you? So that they see your standard pins. You're going to use video pins while you can.

[00:24:17.160] - Meagan
And I want to really encourage you to be continually updating your keyword research. So, as you make your way through the trends, really spend that time doing some extra research on your keywords and the categories with which that content falls into. Because if you aren't making it super clear and letting people identify your content. So, Pinterest has machine learning, so it has to identify. The AI technology has to identify what your content is about to show it to people. Right?

[00:24:46.910] - Meagan
So, if it's confused, it's not going to know who to show it to. So, make sure you're really thinking about that. You're doing research when you upload your idea pins. Remember that idea pins have tag categories, and that also tells you where to show that content. And you can actually leverage some of those tag categories as potential keyword phrases that you could be using for your standard content and your video content as well. So, you're going to be thinking about how you're optimizing your copy with keywords that are up to date and relevant for the season.

[00:25:17.300] - Meagan
You're going to be thinking about how to be consistent, whether that's using a scheduler or doing more manual pinning. You're going to be really thinking about how you can create amazing original idea pins that will give people everything they need to learn for that concept, but not invite them to leave the platform. Now you can do it in a tasteful way. I get asked all the time on client accounts. You know what's the product feature.

[00:25:41.850] - Meagan
But remember, good storytelling, good video is always going to perform and cut it up. You can cut it up into 20 sections. We know that five or more does best. We've seen single idea pins do really well as well. So, whatever you have, just get going.

[00:25:59.160] - Meagan
Don't let this hold you back. Remember, there are people on there that could be becoming part of your audience, diversify those traffic streams so that you could really be protecting your ideas. Your original content. Like you know what's the thing content is King. It's always going to do well if you have good content.

[00:26:19.840] - Meagan
So, if you're finding that your numbers are dropping, think about your fresh content. Think about the fact that maybe you can just retweet an idea. Look at your top performing content that you previously published. Use your Google analytics, use your Pinterest analytics and identify what is your top performing idea pin, how could you do a spin off of that? Why did that one perform so well?

[00:26:41.620] - Meagan
What board did you pin it to? What was your Pin text overlay? What was your Pin title? Remember, Pin titles are incredibly important. Again, they're indexed by Pinterest to understand what the content is about.

[00:26:54.530] - Meagan
So, really think about your Pin title, that text overlay. And as a search engine, make it easy for Pinterest to understand. Now what we actually know is that Pinterest is now and there were some glitches involving Pinterest profiles is that they are now showing recommended profiles in the search bar and making it really easy when people are logged into the app or on desktop to follow. So, make sure that your bio is up to date and includes the most relevant keywords for you, your niche or industry, whatever you create content about. So that you could be the recommended person for Gluten free recipes, for Montessori style activities, for travel in Peru.

[00:27:37.000] - Meagan
You want to really think about how you can be optimizing it and making it a no brainer for Pinterest to want to recommend you because that's just going to help you get in front of more people. We've seen incredible success.

[00:27:48.970] - Meagan
You know people go from under 100 followers to 60,000. We have a person in my membership that has actually done that through creating idea Pins on a regular basis and that type of growth is possible for you as well. You just really have to think about how you can come to the platform in a valuable, original way and not just copy what other people are doing. They want you to lean into who you are. If you've read there's a creator's code, you can look that up and what they really want to do is foster people who maybe feel frustrated by other platforms but feel throttled by reach.

[00:28:23.150] - Meagan
That Pinterest is the place for you to diversify your traffic to get in front of, grow your audience, get in front of more people. And they're calling it to Pinterest 2.0. So, I hope that you found this valuable. I would love to see you go out and create an idea Pin for a blog post that has done really well in the past for you. Or maybe you're going to go out and do some updated keyword research and help go back and further optimize your boards and your profile so that you become a recommended account.
