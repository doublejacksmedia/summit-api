[00:00:09.220] - Melissa Stephenson, fivedesign.co
Hi, I'm Melissa. I'm the founder and owner of Five Design Co, a Squarespace Web design agency that helps small business owners build beautiful and effective websites that grow your business and brand.

[00:00:19.510] - Melissa
One of the things I get asked about all the time as a Web designer, especially now in this online world we've been living in, is how to set up online membership programs, things like online courses, resource libraries or video archives members only forums and other types of interactive online membership groups.

[00:00:35.890] - Melissa
As a business owner, there are so many benefits to having a membership program in your business, which I will share all about. And I am so excited to talk to you today about that and how to create an online membership program for your business.

[00:00:49.430] - Melissa
In this quick training, we're going to chat through why membership programs are so beneficial for your business and why it's so important that you set them up right. The different types of membership programs you could create and the different membership building platforms available to do that. I'll also chat through the specific method I use to create profitable membership programs for my web design clients and for my own business. And I'll leave you with a few resources if you'd like to get started outlining and building your own membership program to.

[00:01:17.870] - Melissa
Okay, so let's get into membership programs and why it's so beneficial to incorporate them in your business. First, membership programs are much more flexible service type. They allow you to offer a product or service to anyone, anywhere in the world at any time of day or night, regardless if you happen to be available to provide them the service or not.

[00:01:36.830] - Melissa
Before becoming a Web designer. I was a certified health coach. And one thing about health coaching that I'll be very familiar for anyone who also provides one on one services is that you have a finite amount of time in your day to provide those services. When you run out of time, you run out of the ability to serve your clients. So, online membership programs offer a way to serve people beyond the confines of your schedule or the number of hours you have in a day, or the number of clients you can fit into your space or whatnot. And they also allow customers more flexibility in accessing your services on a schedule and timeline that works for them; which could make you more accessible to more people.

[00:02:13.880] - Melissa
So, online membership programs are also an opportunity to grow your income. Of course, of your business is limited to the number of clients you can physically fit into your schedule. Your income is also limited by the max number of clients you can take on at one time. But online membership programs allow you to scale your services in a way that you can continue to offer your knowledge and expertise to more clients and even new audiences of clients like people who don't live anywhere near you, which means much higher income potential than a one on one service model.

[00:02:46.260] - Melissa
And passive income is one of the current buzzwords that gets many people interested in starting a membership program. As you likely know, passive income is any type of income you earn while not spending a lot of time or energy working for it. But it's not about being lazy, it's about being efficient. Many online membership programs are a form of passive income. You develop a product or service offering once and you sell it many times. The key thing to note here is that passive income doesn't just happen. It needs to be developed. But the upfront development allows you to sell your product repeatedly from wherever you are at any time of day or night. And if you set it up right, it just runs on autopilot in the background while you get to go do other things.

[00:03:30.300] - Melissa
So, there are a lot of benefits that passive income like this can bring to both your business and your personal life and allows you to reach and serve more people, which means you're also creating more impact. You can dramatically increase your income potential because your income is no longer limited to the number of hours in a day. It frees up time to focus on growing other areas of your business. So you're spending more energy working on your business rather than in it. It allows you to make the same or more money while working fewer hours for it. And because you're able to earn income from anywhere, any time, that means you can travel more, spend more time with family, all those nice things.

[00:04:09.200] - Melissa
So, if you're thinking, "Well, that's great, but how do I know it will work for me?" Unlike other types of business that have different barriers to entry, essentially anyone can create an online membership program. All you need is a computer and Internet access and some expertise that others are interested in. And you can create and manage a successful online membership program.

[00:04:29.970] - Melissa
Now, a lot of people get stuck here and think, "Well, I don't have an idea. I don't have something nobody else has already offered." But I'm confident that you can build a valuable membership program from what you already know and do and have to offer. And if you're not completely sure what that is yet, I'll give you some more tips on that in just a moment.

[00:04:49.620] - Melissa
Now, there are a gazillion different ways to structure an online membership program, but I'm going to highlight the four main types most membership programs fall into. So, you can think about which might be the best fit for your business.

[00:05:01.290] - Melissa
But before we get into those four different types, I just want to point out that each of them can be offered as either a free or paid product or is a supplement to an existing product or service you provide. Free membership programs are typically used as a strategy to grow an audience before you launch a higher level product. For example, back when I was a health coach starting a wellness company, I set up a free membership program to grow my audience while I built the paid products for my business.

[00:05:28.880] - Melissa
In doing that, I was able to build an audience of hundreds of interested people before even launching a product. So when it came time to launch my services, there were already people interested in even hearing about that. So, free membership programs do exist and can be a great way to grow your mailing list and your audience. That said, membership programs are most commonly paid programs that offer content of value for a specific fee. That could be either a one time fee in which your customer pays you and receives access to your program. Or it could be a subscription fee in which your customer pays monthly or annually for as long as they remain a member.

[00:06:06.350] - Melissa
It's also possible to create an online membership program that serves as a supplement to a different business offering you have elsewhere. For example, I worked with an organic family farm that has an existing audience of members who purchase weekly boxes of produce from their farm as a supplement to that physical product. The Farm started an online program for their members to access digital resources, things like; seasonal recipes that they can make with the produce they're receiving in their box; articles; and video tutorials on how to properly store or canned their produce; things like that.

[00:06:38.360] - Melissa
This isn't necessarily a free program, but it's also not paid for directly by members. They receive it as a benefit of another product or service they're already paying for. So, your online membership program could be free, paid or supplemental. And these are the different ways it could be; structured; a simple piece of protected content; a collection of protected content; and a resource library; an online course or training and a membership group.

[00:07:06.840] - Melissa
Protected content is the simplest version of an online membership program, if simply a specific piece of content that is only available to members, almost any type of content can be membership protected. Some examples are; an eBook; video training; a workbook; a Web page or a PDF download like a checklist or how to guide or other type of special content of value to your audience.

[00:06:06.350] - Melissa
This is an example from a fashion designer that membership protects their line sheets, which is a specific resource available only to their wholesale account members who are required to log in to access it.

[00:07:42.590] - Melissa
Next is a resource library, which is, in a sense a larger or more in-depth collection of protected content, usually around specific subject matter. It could include; Web pages; videos; audio files; or downloadable material like PDF or images; could even include a blog or a Podcast. An example of this as the wellness library I mentioned earlier, which is the resource library I set up to grow my audience by offering free, healthy living guides and resources, which I provided via both Web pages and downloadable guides and materials.

[00:08:15.960] - Melissa
Online courses are one of the more common membership program types, they could include a combination of Web pages, videos or downloadable material. The course could be a complete training, like one hour long video, or it could be broken up into a series of modules. Content can be accessible immediately or it can be gipped, making it available a specific amount of time after a member joins your program, for example, opening a new module each week or each month.

[00:08:43.710] - Melissa
Programs can be either ongoing, meaning that your members join at any point or they can be time specific and that they begin and end on specific dates and all members complete the program together. Courses are typically more time and resource intensive to build, but they can also be some of the most in-depth and the most valuable membership programs to offer.

[00:09:03.840] - Melissa
This example here is an online training I created with step by step instructions and tips and resources for setting up an online membership program. So, it's a DIY version of everything you do for my custom web design clients, which allows more people to work with me and offers a lower price point for those who need it.

[00:09:22.730] - Melissa
And finally, a membership group is something that could exist in and of itself as an online membership program, or it can serve as a supplement to an in-person or real life group that exists elsewhere. Like the example I shared earlier from the farm. Membership groups can involve a combination of features like, videos, web pages, articles, downloadable material, as well as an interactive forum, community directory or special links like access to a members only Facebook group.

[00:09:50.710] - Melissa
So, these are the four main types of online membership programs. You may find that several of them would work for your business, and that's great. It's certainly possible to host multiple different membership programs within your business. And that can be a way to serve specific segments of your audience or provide a tiered program offerings at different price points.

[00:10:08.440] - Melissa
So, now let's chat about the technology we'll need to do all of this. There are quite a few different platforms that allow you to build and sell an online membership program. First, one of the questions I get a lot is why we can't just put a password on a Web page and protect our content that way. Most website platforms like WordPress or Squarespace do allow you to password protect any page on your website, but it uses just one password to do that. So, you need to share the same password with all of your members and then they could share it with anyone they'd like as well. So, the protected content is not secure. This also means that if you built a membership program with more than one page, any navigation to different page would require members to submit a password again, which is not very user friendly.

[00:10:52.730] - Melissa
So it's just not a reasonable or effective method of membership protecting your content, which is why there are other tools out there to help.

[00:11:01.010] - Melissa
There are several popular online course creating platforms like Teachable Kajabi, Thinkific and Podia. They're known for simple and easy course creation. They typically have a nice interface and some fancy features. And you don't need a website to host your course because it's hosted directly on the platform itself. And they also have a built in sales page for you there.

[00:11:21.500] - Melissa
These tools do make online course creation easy, but there are a few drawbacks to be aware of, too. It can be somewhat of a detriment to have to host your course on an external platform instead of on your own website. But they do offer some ability to style your course to match your business's existing branding. It can be pretty limited and in most cases the user experience is a little choppy because it does take users away from your site to a third party site; and it looks like it's doing that.

[00:11:48.260] - Melissa
Most of these platforms are designed to support online courses. So, they're not there's not much flexibility in the other membership types I mentioned earlier, like resource archives or interactive membership groups.

[00:12:01.130] - Melissa
And even though for some people it can be a perk to create a membership program without having your own website for SEO purposes and to grow your business long term, you do want to have your own website anyway, and you don't want your sales page with all the key content about your program being hosted on someone else's website.

[00:12:20.300] - Melissa
So, those are just a few drawbacks to be aware of. But that said, many people use and like these platforms and they can be a great option if their limitations aren't an issue for you.

[00:12:31.270] - Melissa
The next option is to host your membership program on your own website. There are a few different ways of doing this, depending on the website platform you use. And I'll talk through those options in a moment.

[00:11:01.010] - Melissa
But first, just want to highlight a few of the benefits of hosting your membership content on your own website.

[00:12:47.380] - Melissa
One, you're able to retain your existing branding and create a more seamless user experience for your customers. It also gives you a bit more control over the content you're able to include in your program. The other tools do allow for a range of content as well. But this typically allows you to include anything in your membership program that you can host on your website, like videos, audio files, web pages, blog posts, PDF downloads, images, forums, directories, links, podcasts and probably something else I'm forgetting, too.

[00:13:18.070] - Melissa
You also have a lot more flexibility and control over the design and functionality of your program, how it will be structured and how users will flow through and experience it. And one of the things that many small business owners managing their own websites and technology like about this method is that it doesn't require you to learn a new platform. You can build and update your membership content directly on your existing website, SEO. If you're familiar with your website platform, you're good to go with building and managing your membership program as well.

[00:13:47.920] - Melissa
If you have a WordPress website .

[00:13:49.480] - Melissa
There are a couple membership plugin options that allow you to protect content on your website. Member press, restrict Content Pro or Learn Dash are all paid plugins that can be added to your WordPress website.

[00:14:02.830] - Melissa
Now, I'll be very honest. I designed exclusively on Squarespace. It's my favorite website platform for a lot of reasons and most of my membership building expertise is with regard to Squarespace. So, I'm not an expert on these particular WordPress plugins. But if you have a WordPress website and you plan on staying there, these are your current membership plugin options. And we'll get to another option for you in just a moment. Squarespace just released their very own native membership feature called Squarespace Member Areas, which allows you to create members only pages on your Squarespace website.

[00:14:34.660] - Melissa
This feature is an additional subscription that can be added on to any Squarespace website, if you'd like. It's definitely the easiest, quickest way to host membership protected pages on your Squarespace website. There are some functionality limitations to it, like the payment options you can offer and how you structure tiers of membership and how you engage with and communicate with members once they're in your program. So, I would say right now this is best for smaller, more simple membership programs, but it's definitely a great option to consider. If you have a Squarespace website. And there's also another option for membership, protecting content on any Web site platform. And it's called Member Space.

[00:15:10.960] - Melissa
And it happens to be my favorite memory space as a third party tool that allows you to membership protect pages and content like file downloads on your website, integrates with Squarespace, WordPress, Whibley, Wick's and a bunch of other website platforms, too.

[00:15:28.330] - Melissa
This is the membership method I have used most often for my clients because it has the most functionality and flexibility for designing many different types of membership programs. And also growing your membership program over time. It integrates nicely with a bunch of other business tools you might want to use for your membership program, like a members only forum, a member directory and members only Podcast and of course, your email marketing software so you can communicate with your program members.

[00:15:55.150] - Melissa
I would say I end up recommending this method probably eight to nine times out of ten for the different membership programs I come across and consult on.

[00:16:04.330] - Melissa
Now, which membership platform would be the most suitable for you? Depends on the type of membership program you're building. For example, if it's an online course or resource library or an interactive membership group where your website is already hosted and if you want to keep it there, the type of content you'll be included in your program, like videos or downloads or a members only blog and the payment options you'll need for your members.

[00:16:30.470] - Melissa
There are certainly cases in which each of these different tools would be the best fit. But like I said, I tend to recommend member space in most cases that I see because it works across many different website platforms and it has the most functionality and flexibility in terms of designing your content and member experience.

[00:16:49.260] - Melissa
Now to create a membership program, you will need a topic whether you already have an idea in mind or you'll need to do some brainstorming, here are some things you'll want to consider in choosing the topic of your program.

[00:17:00.600] - Melissa
First, think about what you know, what skills or areas of expertise do you have or do others tell you you're good at? Then think about what people need from you. What do they ask you for help with? What advice do you give over and over again? And third, consider what you enjoy doing. What do you do even though you don't get paid for it? What would you like to have time to do more of? And great topic for your membership program will be right here in the middle, a few tips as you think through potential topics for your membership program. Keep it simple, you can always add onto your program down the road. It is absolutely 100% okay and even encouraged that you start small and build up from there.

[00:17:43.660] - Melissa
With that in mind, if you have a very large topic idea. Think about how you can break it down into smaller, more specific and tangible pieces. You can always start with one and add to it over time to create an even larger, more comprehensive program or resource.

[00:18:00.110] - Melissa
If you have multiple topics that seem like viable contenders think through, which is likely to be the most useful to your target audience at this time. If one of your ideas is more advanced than the others, consider starting at the beginning and continuing to create and build additional course content as your audience makes their way through your content along with you. So, you start at a basic level and then add intermediate and advanced editions down the road when you've already built more of an audience that's looking for that.

[00:18:28.560] - Melissa
Make sure your idea aligns with your long term goals and you can sustain a business around it or easily fit it into your existing business, and you don't have to brainstorm alone, go ahead and phone a friend, ask your audience what's of interest to them. If you have an email list or a social media following a poll, if you're starting from scratch, reach out to people who know who you know in your field or among your target audience and ask them what their greatest challenge with it is or what they would love your help on.

[00:18:59.240] - Melissa
If you're a service provider consider your current limitations, what could you use help with right now? Are you unable to meet demand? Are there certain systems or processes your clients find useful that you could train them on? Is there a certain aspect of your work that you don't actually want to do one on one anymore and you could create a program for others to do it themselves?

[00:19:20.360] - Melissa
And listen to what people are already saying. The best program and service ideas are born out of meeting a need that already exists, solving a problem that people actually have and they know they have and are telling others about it.

[00:19:35.330] - Melissa
So, that is a quick overview of the technology options for hosting an online program and a few tips on choosing a topic idea that would work well for your business to help you get started on all of this, I am sharing my member space checklist, which includes all the steps of setting up a membership program on MemberSpace, which, of course, is my favorite method and generally the best option for most membership programs that I work with.

[00:19:59.170] - Melissa
And I'm also leaving a link here to the free membership building resources you can find on my website.

[00:19:59.170] - Melissa
And if you'd like more guidance and inspiration, including creating your own membership protected content, I outline literally all my best hopes in the membership lab, which is its own membership program on building membership programs. So, in addition to giving you a blueprint on the exact steps I use to create online membership programs for my clients, it's also a real life example program. So, you can see how everything comes together and functions.

[00:20:28.280] - Melissa
The Membership Lab includes six modules and video trainings, including; how to choose the best membership platform for your needs; How to brainstorm and validate your profitable topic idea; how to structure your program content; all the tech tips on building it out on your website; and it also includes instructions and best practices on creating a sales page and marketing your program, preparing for your program, launch and ongoing management of your program.

[00:20:53.120] - Melissa
The modules are broken up into quick little videos, so you can go through them at your own pace. And there are plenty of workbooks and downloads and an interactive planning and pricing template.

[00:21:02.360] - Melissa
And one of the features people say they appreciate the most is the Members Only Question portal, which is your direct access to me or my team. And any questions come up, whether it's about the technology or business strategy or you can't decide what to name or price your program. Really, any membership billing questions you have? We are there to help.

[00:21:23.150] - Melissa
The Membership Lab was designed for Squarespace users and all of the tutorials use Squarespace Web sites as examples.

[00:21:29.810] - Melissa
But if you're planning to use MemberSpace, that awesome tool I keep mentioning, most of the training will still apply to you regardless of which website platform you're on. I am leaving the link here if you'd like to check it out or sign up. And if you're watching this training, you can use code Blogger for a special discount.

[00:21:46.980] - Melissa
So, I hope this was helpful and gives you some tangible tips you can use to get started with your own online membership program. Thank you for watching and feel free to reach out with any questions.
