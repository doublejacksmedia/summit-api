Hey, guys. Welcome to the Potent Action Workshop. My name is Faith Mariah, and I'm going to be talking about how to create more results in one week than you did in the last 30 days without working more hours. All right, I'm really excited. Let's go ahead and jump into this. If we haven't met or become Internet friends yet, I'm faith Mariah.

[00:00:35.980] - Faith
I'm a business mindset coach. I'm the founder of the Becoming Boss Mastermind. I'm a certified life and weight loss coach. My background is in social work, and then I also have experience making full-time income online for the last seven years.

[00:00:52.660] - Faith
And I currently generate multiple six figures online, and I help other women that want to do the same. And I am very excited to help you with your business today. So, the first thing I want to talk about when we talk about increasing our results without increasing hours is that not all actions are equal. So, what I see happen a lot is entrepreneurs, especially new entrepreneurs, have this thought error that is, I want more results, therefore I just need to do more things. I just need to do more actions.

[00:01:27.780] - Faith
This is kind of how we're taught goal setting in our culture, which doesn't work because most people fail their new year's resolutions and aren't able to pursue goals, especially over a long period of time. And if you're going to build a business, that is a long term goal. It's year after year after year, not just one year as a resolution, so it has to go even longer. And so, it requires a much, much higher level of thinking even than doing a new year's resolution for an entire year. It's a much different level of commitment and thinking.

[00:02:00.940] - Faith
So, most people think, they're like, I want more results, I just need to do more tasks. I just need to do more things. I just need to do more things on my to-do list. And what I see a lot of people do is they're very, very busy. They're doing lots of things, but they're not necessarily creating results.

[00:02:17.520] - Faith
So, the first thing I want to offer you guys is you want to be, do not get lost in, like, just doing tasks on a to-do list. You want to be focused on what results do I need to create to create customers? Okay. A lot of people look at analytics and they look at the wrong numbers, the most important number when you're an entrepreneur or you're a business owner is always sales.

[00:02:41.800] - Faith
And so, we really want to be thinking, okay, we're trying to create the results of sales. What are the most potent things I can do? And you really want to figure out what's going to give you the most bang for your buck. You have to put your brain to work and test things, right? So, you're just going to have to take your best guess, come up with a hypothesis, I think these tasks will give me the most bang for my buck and create customers.

[00:03:10.470] - Faith
I think I'll be able to get the most leverage doing Instagram reels or I think I'll be able to get the most leverage learning Facebook ads. And you just have to take your best guess and go test it, right? So, you're always testing things, evaluating the results, adjusting, testing things, evaluating the results. And that's going to help you move forward so much faster than most people, right? Most of you probably don't have multiple six-figure or seven-figure businesses.

[00:03:37.770] - Faith
And you want to keep your business as simple as possible. If you're making your business complicated, now, think how complicated it's going to be when there's hundreds of thousands of dollars and lots and lots of clients and lots and lots of stuff going on. It's like we want to start with a very simple foundation, a simple and effective foundation. And so, when you're thinking about creating more results, I don't want you to think about just doing more tasks and doing more stuff. I want to think about getting results.

[00:04:08.320] - Faith
And what I find is if I can get people to focus less on just doing more stuff, doing more stuff, doing more stuff, and being on that treadmill, I need more time. We're going to talk about that. I don't have enough time. I need more time because I need to do more stuff, right? If I can get you out of that and take you to a place of life, how can you triple the free value you're giving?

[00:04:30.210] - Faith
How can you really, really take to the next level everything you're doing that's working? So, what is working? And how can you make that even better? How could you make your emails more valuable to people? How can you make your podcast more valuable to people?

[00:04:46.330] - Faith
How can you make your challenges and your live events and the things that you do before you sell? How can you make those more valuable for people and really upping that nurture piece, right? What's the most effective way for you to get leads right now? Not just like posting on Instagram. A lot of times people are just like, oh, I just post three times a day.

[00:05:04.840] - Faith
That's not a strategy because it doesn't necessarily create a result, except for you posting on Instagram. But that's not what you guys want. You guys want customers, right? So, it's much more useful for you guys to think about, how can I get three customers this week than focusing on, let me post on Instagram three times a week. Like, the intention is different.

[00:05:25.750] - Faith
One is just checking tasks off the list. Post on Instagram three times a week. Check, check, check, do, do, do, task, task, task, right? And one is outcome focus.

[00:05:34.870] - Faith
How can I create three customers this week? And then if you do post on Instagram, it's going to be much more intentional because you're trying to post on Instagram not just to check off your stuff on your to do list because you heard somewhere that you need to post on Instagram three times a week, right? You're going to be focusing on posting with more intention to actually create clients. Okay? Remember that the only outcome you really, really want to focus on is creating sales and clients, don't get lost in the sauce.

[00:06:01.800] - Faith
A lot of times people get focused on follower numbers or email list size and like, you know, that stuff is important to an extent and those numbers can be helpful. But for most of you, you need to focus on getting sales. If you're not getting sales, like, adding more followers is not going to help you. If you're not getting sales, adding more people to your email is not going to help you. Right?

[00:06:24.270] - Faith
We need to fix those things and fixing that process, seeing where is your business breaking down? Why are we not making those sales? How can I increase revenue? Putting your brain to work on those things and working on problem solving and creating results is very different than just like, okay, send out my weekly newsletter, check.

[00:06:43.470] - Faith
Post on Instagram three times a week, check. Record my podcast, check. And like, you could do all those things and be busy working every week and create absolutely no results. So, I wrote on the slide, more action does not equal better results. Adding more action and time is lazy thinking.

[00:06:59.800] - Faith
So, the most common thing I see is people are like, I want more results, I just don't have enough time. I wish I had more time, I don't have enough time. Right? And the reason they think they need more time is because they think they need to do more things, do more tasks. I just need to be busier.

[00:07:15.790] - Faith
Being busier does not necessarily make you money. Most of the time, it just makes your business very, very inefficient. Most people, when they get more time, produce at the exact same level they're producing now, they produce very similar results. I have very rarely seen an entrepreneur quit their job or clear up a significant amount of time off their calendar and all of a sudden it start producing results. Maybe they add more tasks and they start doing more actions, but usually they are creating the same amount of sales.

[00:07:46.350] - Faith
It's kind of like you are selling at the level you're selling at and adding more time doesn't up level you're selling. Adding more time doesn't make your post any better. If they're not getting customers now, like adding more time and doing more of them is not going to help that. And so, we want to focus on the potency in which we are doing things. So, these are some better questions.

[00:08:08.200] - Faith
How could you cut your hours in half and double your income? I actually did this one year as my new year's resolution. I cut my hours to 20 hours a week. And doubled our income from 100,000 to 200,000. Right?

[00:08:21.790] - Faith
So, I literally doubled the results I was getting with less time. Because time doesn't create more results. Time and results are not linked. They're not linked. It's like, yeah.

[00:08:32.170] - Faith
Do you have to have some time to work? Yeah. But adding more time does not necessarily create more results. In fact, what I see most of the time, especially new entrepreneurs, when you guys have more time, you just have more time to be confused. Think about how you don't know what to do.

[00:08:47.190] - Faith
Think about, I don't know how to do this, should I do this, should I do that, I don't know if it's working? What if it's not working? What if this is a waste of time and you just indulge in more low level thinking? You just waste more time being confused, right?

[00:08:58.620] - Faith
So, for most of us, like when we have more time, it doesn't create more results. It just creates more time for us to be confused and indulge in how we don't know what to do and indulge in a bunch of lazy, low level thinking. That's what it creates for probably 98% of the people. I've pushed a lot of entrepreneurs, so probably hundreds, hundreds of entrepreneurs. And probably for all of them, when we give them more time to do things, it just allows you to indulge in inefficiencies and be inefficient and be confused and have a lot of low level thinking.

[00:09:29.140] - Faith
Like giving yourself less time gives you less time to mess around. So, how could you cut your hours in half and double your income? That's a really good place to take your brain because you'll start seeing the leverage points of, like, what actually has to happen to make money. That's where what you need to figure out is, like, what actually has to happen to make money. And you do that with very specific thinking, with testing very specific strategies.

[00:09:58.260] - Faith
Right? Our brains don't like specificity. They love to dabble. They love to be confused. They don't like to do the deep thinking that we need to do to make this happen.

[00:10:08.940] - Faith
And this is a very good place to take your brain. It will require you to get very specific about the things that are working and the things that are not. And it will require you, in the time that you do have and the content you are putting out for that to be very, very good. Because you're not just going to be putting out tons of random stuff anymore. How could you create more results this week than you did in the last 30 days?

[00:10:31.200] - Faith
We do this challenge in my community kind of regularly. We did it twice this year. And people are always very surprised. Look at the results. And by results, I mostly mean sales, right?

[00:10:43.870] - Faith
Revenue. How can you create more money this week than you did in the last 30 days? That's a very good challenge. And think about if you put your brain to work at that every week, and you thought about that and you worked at that in a year. Think how much more efficient you're going to be at making money.

[00:11:03.070] - Faith
Right? We do not need more time. This does not have to take a long time. You do not need more time to do more tasks. You need to do less things at a higher level.

[00:11:12.760] - Faith
And the easiest way to up level your content is just give yourself less time to do things. We have a really common thought error that is, I think I have a slide on this, but we have a really common thought error that is more time. If I spend more time on things, the quality will improve. But like I said, when you have more time, you're usually just indulging in low level thinking, which does not improve the quality of your content. Right.

[00:11:39.250] - Faith
So, time and quality, not linked. Not linked. Some of my best work has taken me no time at all. Just came right out. Right.

[00:11:47.820] - Faith
So, I just want you guys to unlink those in your brain. Very not helpful when you're an entrepreneur. And then this is one of my favorite questions. We call this, like, the $20 Challenge or the $20 question. If people were paying $20 a month to be on your email list, would you feel good about the content?

[00:12:02.940] - Faith
If they were paying $20 a month to read your blog, would you feel good about that content? Right. A lot of us think that our free content doesn't have to be as good. We don't want to give our best stuff away for free. And I just think that's never a good use of your time.

[00:12:19.740] - Faith
Like, what I think is a better use of your time is growing your reputation as someone who creates a lot of valuable content. Right. I think I believe a lot in networking and growing your business through networking. And you're not going to network well if your emails and your blogs are not valuable, if your podcast isn't valuable, like, that stuff isn't doing much for your business. But if you're providing a ton of value, I'm like, I want my free stuff to be better than most people's paid stuff.

[00:12:46.810] - Faith
I want our free trainings to be better than most of the courses people buy. That's how good I want my paid stuff, right? And then take your brain to a place of, like, what if they were paying $100 a month? Would you be proud of the emails you're sending? What if they were paying $1,000 and then put your brain to work of like, what would have to be in my emails to be able to charge $1,000 a month?

[00:13:07.260] - Faith
Like it's just a good place to take your brain. It allows you to create more results for your people and create more customers without just doing more tasks and doing more tasks and doing more stuff. Okay, this is one of my favorite. Like, I can really go on a rant about this, but I'm going to try and be brief so I can get through these slides for you guys. You decide how long things take.

[00:13:29.260] - Faith
So, something I see in here a lot is people in their business talk about tasks as if they don't have any input about how long they take, right? And this is just another thought error, and it's just not true. Like, you decide how long your tasks take. Like I was coaching someone the other day, and she's like, well, it takes me 90 minutes to write an email. And I was like, stop doing that.

[00:13:53.210] - Faith
I was like, don't get yourself, I was like, 90 minutes to do what. Right? So, I was like, I would try to write your email in 20 minutes, right. Decide to develop the skill of writing an email in 20 minutes. And I was telling her, I was like, think about over the lifetime of your business, how much more you will get done year after year after year if you learn how to write an email in 20 minutes versus just letting it take 90 minutes every time you do it. And things really expand to take the amount of time that you give yourself.

[00:14:25.030] - Faith
And a lot of entrepreneurs don't decide ahead of time how long tasks take, and then they take probably about four times as long, right, as they usually do. And so, one of the things we do when we talk about, like, increasing, like, getting more results is like, first of all, focus on that potency, not the volume, because that's the most important thing. But second of all, like, I do think it is important to give yourself less time to do things and learn to become someone who controls their time, right? When you're just like, I don't know how long it's going to take, I don't know how long it's going to take to write the email.

[00:14:57.340] - Faith
I don't know how long it's going to take to record a module. I've never done it before. I don't know. It's like, you're just going to end up letting that path take. I mean, who knows how long?

[00:15:05.890] - Faith
Like, a really, really, really long time. This is how it ends up taking people months and months and months and months to do their course, or months and months and months to make their sales page, or whatever it is that they're putting off because they just don't give themselves any deadlines. So, everything you do when you sit down to work, you want to know what result you're creating in that time and how long you're going to take. And you decide that ahead of time with the highest part of your brain, you decide, how long am I going to spend writing this email ahead of time.

[00:15:33.430] - Faith
You don't just let the course take however long or the emails take however long. Like, you have control over this, the amount of time you spend on tasks and how long things take is 100% within your control. That's a much more useful thought, right? Then just like, I just have to see how long it takes. And people push back on me on this sometimes.

[00:15:50.670] - Faith
And I always use this example of like, how long does it take to write a term paper? Like, if you go to grad school, like, I did a thesis, right? If I go to grad school and I don't just tell the teacher, well, I've never wrote a thesis before, I don't know how long it's going to take. I'm just going to have to see. I'll just have to see how long it takes.

[00:16:06.940] - Faith
It's like, no, they have like, deadlines. It's like, you have to have it done by this date, right? And so, instead of them telling you the deadline, you do that for yourself. You decide how long you have to do things and how long things are going to take, right, and you get it done. And thesis are huge.

[00:16:23.610] - Faith
It's a pain in the butt, right? But you can still get it done in that timeframe because we do have control over how long things take, right? And then this is, I just love this, I know I already said it, but I have to say it again. More time does not equal better quality work, right?

[00:16:39.730] - Faith
So, a lot of times when I start talking about this stuff, people are like, well, that's fine, faith, but I really want my stuff to be really good, and I only want to put out the best stuff. And I'm like, more time doesn't equal better quality. Right? I think quantity creates quality, right? Like I always say, like, I'm good at coaching or I'm good at teaching this stuff because I've done it for hundreds and hundreds of hours, right?

[00:17:02.710] - Faith
Literally. Literally, we just uploaded all of my replays into a portal for a program, and it's hundreds of ours. I think that makes me better at what I do. And it will be the same for posting on social media or writing emails.

[00:17:14.230] - Faith
It's like the more you send them, the more you do it, the better you will get at it. And so, quantity can create quality. Usually, the people that are thinking like, oh, I want to create quality, they have this thought that's like, oh, I want my stuff to be very good. I only want to put all my best stuff right? And what that creates for them is a bunch of pressure and stress and overwhelm.

[00:17:38.200] - Faith
And those feelings do not create your best work. I would say, like, genius ideas don't live in stress and overwhelm. That's not when your best stuff is going to come to you, right? And so, all you're doing when you're thinking the thought, I want to put out my best stuff is usually just making yourself very slow. It doesn't make your quality of work better.

[00:17:59.290] - Faith
It just makes you slow. Okay, so give yourself less time. You don't necessarily even have to do more tasks. I would rather cut your time in half and just work half as much, right and create the same amount of results that you did last month. Like, would you cut your hours, and how potent would your work have to be, and efficient.

[00:18:19.090] - Faith
So, when I'm talking about potency, I'm not talking about, like, spending hours and hours and hours on email to write the best email of all time, because I don't think time and quality are linked, okay? So, when we're talking about increasing potency, it's not like, oh, spend a really long time on it. Like time and quality are not linked. Okay, I'm going to go through these facts.

[00:18:38.080] - Faith
These are just low level thoughts people have about time. I don't have enough time. I'm really busy. I have a lot to do. I don't need to do it now, I can do it later.

[00:18:46.530] - Faith
My brain loves that one. My brain is like, we're very tired. We can do it later. I'm not doing enough. I think women, in general, most women have this thought in the loop in the back of their mind, which is like, I should be doing more, I should be doing more, I should be doing more.

[00:19:00.070] - Faith
I'm not doing enough. And I actually think that's what creates burnout. Not the amount of hours that you work, it's the amount of hours that you work and the time that you spent thinking that you should be doing more. And it's not enough. I've been working really hard.

[00:19:14.290] - Faith
And that's another one. I've been working really hard. It's like, what does that mean? Creates the result of you not working that hard. So, I just want to show you this very quickly.

[00:19:24.900] - Faith
I know I said it, but I think it's helpful to see it written down. So, the fact is there's 24 hours in a day. That's a fact. We could take it to a court of law. Okay?

[00:19:34.990] - Faith
And then a lot of times I see people's thought about there being 24 hours in a day. They think, I don't have enough time. And then that thought creates overwhelm, which makes them actually work less efficiently and spend more time being confused and debating what to do first and putting off making decisions and complaining to family about how busy they are, right? And not making progress on their business. And the result of those actions is that they create less time for themselves.

[00:20:06.640] - Faith
Right? So, you want to look at, like, what am I thinking about time? How does that make me feel when I'm thinking and feeling those things? What am I doing and what result am I creating? And the thought, I don't have enough time almost never creates anything useful.

[00:20:23.350] - Faith
I coached a lot of people. I just don't see it being useful for anybody, really. So, let's just, I'm going to just kind of summarize, getting more done, right? And when I'm talking about getting more done, it's not just like doing more stuff. It's like creating more results, right?

[00:20:38.940] - Faith
Being more intentional with the things that we are creating. And I think like, to increase intention and increase potency takes less time, not more time. I think creating great results for yourself takes less time, not more time. Okay? Give yourself less time to do things and become someone who does things fast.

[00:20:59.050] - Faith
Think about how different your business will be in five years if you spend the next five years focusing on doing tasks in less time, giving yourself less time to do things, not indulging in, should I do it this way? Should I do that way? Should I do this way? Should I do that way?

[00:21:13.500] - Faith
Should I write about this? Should I write about that? It's like being someone who is decisive and sits down and does it and knocks it out and doesn't indulge in any of that stuff and works efficiently. Like, think how much further your business is going to be in a year, five years, ten years.

[00:21:26.520] - Faith
I'm always like, as a business owner, you got to look far out, right? A lot of new entrepreneurs are like looking down like right in front of them. It's like you need to look up. Businesses are long game, long term.

[00:21:37.080] - Faith
Ten years. Look up. And think about how much time you're going to spend if you become someone who is fast and set time boundaries for yourself. Do not give yourself unlimited amounts of time to make modules or make courses or make products or write blog posts. Like, give yourself very, very challenging deadlines. Like really challenge yourself to become someone who is fast.

[00:22:02.970] - Faith
Right? And like, I'm saying, I think that will result in your higher quality work to do. I think you'll indulge in less low level thinking and you'll output more and you'll be able to help so many more people and you will just get better just by sheer quantity, right? It's like if you make a thousands TikToks, you're going to be a lot better than someone who spent a lot of time thinking about TikToks and posted five of them. I guarantee it.

[00:22:28.360] - Faith
Okay. Focus on what is working and what you did get done. A lot of people spend a lot of time thinking, I'm not doing enough, I should be doing more. Spend time focusing on like what you are doing and what you did get done. When we're focusing all of our energy on thinking about I'm not doing enough, I'm not doing enough, I'm not doing enough, we create a just loose loop that we create for ourselves where it's just like there's no winning, right?

[00:22:58.020] - Faith
And the thing with that thought is a lot of people have that thought and it has nothing to do with how much they're doing. I should be doing more. I should be doing more. I canva get enough time to be working the business more. Right?

[00:23:08.080] - Faith
A lot of women will make the decision, I want to spend the day with my kid. I just coached someone on this. She took the day to spend with her kid because her kid was sick, and then she came to coaching, and it was telling me how she didn't get enough done on our business. And I'm like, you didn't not get enough done on your business. You made a decision to spend time with your kid.

[00:23:23.680] - Faith
Like have your own back about that, right? But if you make a decision to spend time with your kid and then you're telling yourself, I need to be working on the business more, that's a loose loose loop that you're putting yourself in where there's nowhere for you to win, right? It's just like you're just doing it wrong all the time. And guess what? It's not sustainable when we're talking about doing a business long term, ten years out.

[00:23:45.820] - Faith
Like, if you feel like you're losing all the time and you can't win and you're putting yourself in positions where you can't win and you don't have your own back about the decisions you're making, you will burn out, and you will give up, and you will quit, and you will make no money. I'm like, laughing. But it's like, I really think that's true. Just follow your calendar. This is like a mantra in my mastermind and in my community. This is thought has made me a lot of money.

[00:24:08.890] - Faith
It's like, I'm just going to follow my calendar. I'm just going to follow my calendar. I put all of the tasks I need to do on my calendar, and then I just follow. I'm always like, Google calendar's the boss of me. Google calendar's the boss of me.

[00:24:20.790] - Faith
I just follow my calendar, and it opts me out of so much drama, and it saves so much energy, because I never come in this office and have to think, what should I do? What should I work on? Should I do that? Should I be doing that? Should I do this thing or that?

[00:24:32.890] - Faith
It's like, I know exactly what results I need to create, and I spend no time doing low level tasks. A lot of times when we don't have a plan and we sit down in the office, you guys end up on, like, Pinterest, or we end up on Facebook, and we don't end up doing the difficult challenging things that we know we need to do to move the business forward, right? So, spend less time dabbling around and more time doing those tedious, difficult tasks that are going to move your business forward. You know like how many people on here know you need to have a product, but you haven't made it yet? Like, don't go on Facebook till you make that product.

[00:25:07.010] - Faith
Don't do it. Get it done. And if you've made a product, you get what I'm saying? It's whatever you've been putting off, just go do that thing. Put it.

[00:25:16.650] - Faith
On your calendar. Break it up into small chunks. The other thing I see people do is they put way too big of projects on their calendar. So, it'll be like, create course on their calendar. That's just too big for your brain.

[00:25:29.260] - Faith
It needs to be like, create slides for module one, and then it needs to be like record module one, and then it's like upload module one. It's like all of your tasks broken out on your calendar. Because if you put work on course, it's like, what does that mean? I don't know if I got that done. I don't know.

[00:25:45.420] - Faith
Did I get a lot done? Did I get a little done? Did I get the task done? I don't know. Because it's like, what does that mean, work on course?

[00:25:50.710] - Faith
I don't know. Well, I guess I worked on it. I don't know what I was trying to accomplish. I don't know what result I was creating. I was just doing tasks.

[00:25:57.880] - Faith
I wasn't creating a result. So, break things up into little things. Plan ahead of time to not want to follow your calendar. You're not going to want to follow your calendar. You're not.

[00:26:08.800] - Faith
When you come time to sit down, your brain is going to be like, we're very tired. My brain always does that. It's like, I'm very tired. We've been working very hard. We're very tired.

[00:26:18.690] - Faith
It's going to offer you that stuff. And it's not a problem. That's just what human brains do because human brains are designed to conserve energy for survival. The survival thing in your brain, it's not because you're lazy and you suck. Like, contrary to popular belief, it's not because of that.

[00:26:35.460] - Faith
It's just a survival mechanism in your brain. So, you want to know, oh, I have a human brain. It has this survival mechanism in it. I'm going to sit down to do the calendar, and my brain is going to tell me thoughts about how I don't want to do it. And that is not a problem as long as you understand that and you plan ahead of time to not want to do it and you plan ahead of time to do it anyway.

[00:26:56.960] - Faith
Let's see, you do things you don't want to do every day, right? So, you don't have to want to follow your calendar because you do things you, I mean, you probably don't want to feed your kids all the time either. You probably don't want to pick your kids up from school all the time, but you do those things. We do things we don't want to do every day. So, you're not wanting to follow your calendar is not a problem unless you're managing your mind poorly and letting your brain offer you that thought, I don't want to do this, and then being like, yeah, let's go watch Netflix.

[00:27:25.690] - Faith
Start small and consistent. If you've not been following a calendar, do not try to follow like, a 40 hours a week calendar. Try to do, like, one thing, okay? One thing every week. Like, okay, Monday at 10:00 a.m., every week, I'm going to start writing emails.

[00:27:39.030] - Faith
Just do that. Use thoughts that create sustainability in your business. So, I always say the energy in which you do things matters. Okay? And we talk about action fuel.

[00:27:51.240] - Faith
Like, what energy are you fueling your actions with? What is your action fuel? And your action fuel is your thought feeling combo. So, it's what you're thinking and it's how you're feeling while you're taking the action. Okay?

[00:28:07.090] - Faith
So, a lot of people, when they start, will use stress or overwhelm to drive them to take action. And that might work for some of you for a little bit. It's like, we can really activate our nervous systems and get ourselves to go do a bunch of work. It is not sustainable. You will burn out.

[00:28:25.060] - Faith
That is what creates burnout. That is what creates overwhelm. If you're feeling stressed out or overwhelmed, just know it has nothing to do with your to do list. We always say, like, your to do list is neutral. You don't have a lot of things to do or a few things to do.

[00:28:38.820] - Faith
You just have things to do and then your thoughts about them. That's it. To do list is neutral. You don't have too much to do until you have the thought, I have too much to do. I promise.

[00:28:47.820] - Faith
I know a lot of you are like, you don't know my life. You don't know about me, though. I do the same thing to my coach. I'm like, you don't know my pain. Right?

[00:29:01.090] - Faith
So, you want to use thoughts and feelings that create sustainability. Thoughts and feelings that create overwhelm. I don't have enough time to do this. This isn't going to work. I don't know if this is going to work.

[00:29:10.380] - Faith
Like, that stuff is not sustainable. You've got to find a sustainable thought that will help you take action. What are mine, I'll tell you right now because my brain is always offering me like, no one's going to like this. Anytime I'm making new stuff, it's like, no one's going to like this.

[00:29:24.900] - Faith
This isn't even that good, right? A lot of us have those thoughts. It's totally normal to have those thoughts. It's the human brain thing, right? And I'll just go to a place that's like, even if no one likes this, I still want to try to help someone.

[00:29:38.890] - Faith
Even though I don't know if the business is going to grow or not, I still want to see what happens. Like, find somewhere neutral to take yourself. Anytime you feel yourself starting to get stressed or overwhelmed, it's like, stop. Like find a grounding thought, change your action fuel, right?

[00:29:56.910] - Faith
If you're feeling stressed and overwhelmed, it's because you're fueling your actions with crappy fuel, right? Crappy thoughts and crappy feelings. So, take a better thought and a better feeling and then take the action. All right? That's it for me.

[00:30:12.340] - Faith
