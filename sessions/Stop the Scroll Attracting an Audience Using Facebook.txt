If I do say so myself.

[00:00:28.850] - Interviewer
Please welcome Juliet Stapleton. Juliet, thank you so much for being here.

[00:00:33.410] - Juliette
Hi, Liz. Hi, everybody. Thank you so much for having me. And yes, our second name is pretty awesome. It's a really beautiful name. And I tell you, this is not the name I was born with, but ever since I have acquired this name, everything's changed in my life. So, there is magic to it.

[00:00:51.290] - Interviewer
I like it. I like it.

[00:00:53.690] - Interviewer
Alright.

[00:00:54.110] - Interviewer
So, let's go ahead and dive in because you specialize specifically in Facebook, which is just a beast in and of itself. How you know we're going to talk about kind of how you attract your audience with Facebook. But what makes Facebook different from, like, a blog post in terms of you know what's really the goal and kind of how do you switch your mindset for it?

[00:01:17.850] - Juliette
Well, when you're a blogger, I think there is a little bit of a challenge because you're used to expressing yourself, let's say in a particular way. Sometimes, you know it's more strategic for some people, you know maybe sharing some valuable tips and things like that. For some people, it's more of a personal story sharing. But we have to think about in terms of audience. When we're posting something on a blog, how do people see that. We are driving traffic. We have to drive traffic to the blog. We have to optimize it.

[00:01:48.330] - Juliette
So, maybe they will find it in search engines. And the keyword here is find. So, people who we are attracting to our blogs are people who are seeking a particular information. And so, something in your headline Hooker, you know title, something triggered the seeker in a person. And so, they went and they ended up on your blog. That's who you are attracting. However, on social media, people don't go there to seek for information. It's something that everyone you have been there today. You have been in this situation.

[00:02:27.090] - Juliette
You picked up your phone, and I do it in my first, like, 15 seconds, I'm really bad at this of my morning I mean. And you went to do what you want, not to read, not to engage, not to learn, not to buy. Obviously, you went there to look. That's what you actually do. You're just looking, staring at the screen scrolling. And the only time when your brain will engage in the next step, which will be reading, for example, is when you see something that is so familiar, it triggers you on emotional level somewhere.

[00:03:03.750] - Juliette
It just resonates immediately. So, the first line, that's when your brain says, okay, stop, a little light goes up and you just say, okay, let's read this. And of course, there's a lot of things that we read are a lot of nonsense, especially when you are I call it a zombie mode. When we are on social media and Facebook, we're in the zombie mode. We're just too much distraction. We suffer as humanity suffers with constant state of destruction. Anyway, not destruction, distraction anyway, I think hopefully not destruction, but it does destroy our focus.

[00:03:39.390] - Juliette
Right. And it does make us think about, okay, so let's just flip the coin here now as content creators, how do we deal with this. If my audience on Facebook comes to me, but they're all like trying to wake up or trying to just chill. They're not coming to necessarily read my content. And I write, guys, I write really long posts. Probably the longest posts you may have seen on Facebook are from me. So, you know I require a lot of focus from my readers. How can I get them to actually read and go to the end where there may be some sort of call to action.

[00:04:18.330] - Juliette
And the only way to do it is to start with something that's extremely relevant. Whereas when we write a blog, we can introduce someone to a topic. And because they were seeking actively for this information or there's something that brought them there, they are already there. You know it's like if you were doing a presentation in front of a few people or if you have a performance background, when you have a performance, audience comes in. Well, they came in with an intention to look at you because if you just went into the middle of the street and started doing the same act. Not necessarily,

[00:04:53.130] - Juliette
people will stop. Some probably will, because they will resonate and they will like this sort of art. But some won't. Right? So, Facebook is a street. We have to, as opposed to the audience that comes there with an intention to consume your content. We have to do our act. And it really is like street art because we have to accept the fact that there is a constant movement. And a lot of people imagine, you know I don't know, Times Square in New York, somewhere like, this crossing that they show Tokyo and this crossing and they're just walking, walking, walking.

[00:05:25.170] - Juliette
How do you make them stop? First of all, you don't need everybody to stop because they're not all the right people for you. You just need the people who resonate with you to stop and whatever you're doing, whether you're blocking just because it's something that you want to do or you are actually monetizing it. And in that case, it becomes particularly important that the right people stop. You just need to be doing your thing, doing your thing really well. But kind of doing it in a way that if they just blasted you, they know that that's something that they like.

[00:05:52.410] - Juliette
So, it's all about formatting our text and changing the order of how we present the information. So, everything that we start with needs to be kind of the most important point. And in terms of marketing, when you talk about what's the ideal person I'm trying to attract, what is the ideal target? What is the ideal clients? You know what is the audience, what are they thinking at 03:00 in the morning when they are frustrated, they can't sleep. What's going on through their mind? What are the words they're using?

[00:06:30.030] - Juliette
That's really important for social media writing, really using the simple English words that are going through our heads as opposed to some sort of like a more professional language or you know coaching language or any kind of terminology, which you can use when you're writing your blogs. Because the audience came there with an intention to consume your content. Do you see the difference? 

[00:06:53.670] - Interviewer
Yes. Yes. And I think it's one of the things where using fancy language or something on social media doesn't make you look like more of an authority when you're using on social media, it just makes you look kind of annoying.

[00:07:06.750] - Juliette
Well, yeah, it depends on if your target audience speaks that language or not as an example. So, for example, I target coaches. And in the coaching world, we use a lot of words like transformational, alignment, and the coaches know what it is. Even though these words mean thousands of things to thousands of people. It's just know, for them, they kind of know what I mean when I say alignment, even the word clarity. But those are the kind of words. But if you are targeting ordinary people who are not in the coaching world, they don't understand when you say you know transformational energy coach, what does this mean?

[00:07:46.230] - Juliette
You know, so fancy language and actually sounding professional. It depends on who you're trying to impress. You're trying to impress your peers or you're trying to attract clients or monetize. Or you're trying to trigger people. And if you're trying to trigger, when I say trigger, it sort of cause a positive response or stop the scroll. You are trying to stop. You're trying to wake up a zombie, and that's a different task. And professional language doesn't do it. It actually puts the zombie back to sleep. And as you said, for some people, it's just too much because the brain is so not active.

[00:08:22.050] - Juliette
It's not that it's not even active. It's just not focused and in tune with what you are trying to say, that the big words and you know fancy language becomes very difficult to read. Yeah. And that's the difference. So, even if you're using that kind of language in your blog, which is your style and your voice, and that's what you do. I think that finding the way to simplify the language when you are driving traffic from Facebook, for example, to your blog, which, that will be sort of your goal.

[00:08:54.450] - Juliette
Just simplify it. Simplify. Put it in a, you know five year old sort of language, not baby speak, but very, very simple. If you set it to a child, they would kind of get what it was. And that's really the key.

[00:09:08.790] - Interviewer
I like it.

[00:09:09.390] - Interviewer
Okay.

[00:09:09.690] - Interviewer
So, let's move on what would you say is the ideal Facebook post format. You talked about it a little bit, but kind of how do you stop the scroll with the format? Because you know all the posts can have some text or some image or some video and they're just scrolling. So what do you do to make a difference?

[00:09:30.090] - Juliette
Well, let's just establish that there is no such thing as one format of the post that will work. Right? So, you have to find the goal with all sort of marketing social media, especially is to find your own way and just discover what actually attracts people that you want to attract for you. So, for some people, it could be maybe losing a lot of emojis in their posts. But for me, it's a turn-off. Right. So, the secret here is just to make sure. Okay, here, let's just talk about the most important thing.

[00:10:08.010] - Juliette
The most important thing is that we only see two, three lines when we are looking. When we don't go visiting each other's profiles. It's important that we optimize them. It's important that we have all the stuff, good stuff there, but we don't use each other's profiles, and even less, we go to pages. I like what a lot of people think that they use only their business page and they don't use their profile. But actually people visit pages even less. So, we rely so heavily on the newsfeed and in the newsfeed because there's just so many, there's 2 billion users on Facebook alone, and you know there's 90 million pages or something like that.

[00:10:44.910] - Juliette
Everybody's posting. And plus every fifth post is sponsored. So, you know you're bombarded with this content all the time. And all you see is this three lines, three or four lines on the desktop, maybe five. Like, I think on the phone we get a little bit more preview. So that is the most important part of your post of whatever format or whatever way or whatever voice or whatever style you want to use. But that is going to be make or break, whether they're going to stop the scroll and read. And hopefully, someday turn it not someday, but going through your funnel, turn into a buyer from just a scroller or they're just going to scroll.

[00:11:22.810] - Juliette
So, use whatever, say, for example, you wrote a post and maybe it was a post about, maybe it was a post about people-pleasing. And you're talking about people-pleasing and you want to promote this post, or you want to write something that will be similar on social media. Because I wasn't looking for this information, I'm just happened to be in the newsfeed when your post comes in. If your opening line describes some sort of scenario that I was a people pleaser, how it made me feel, like literally, illustrate what does it look in somebody's life.

[00:11:58.150] - Juliette
That's the best in my opinion, because we have all different opinions. You can take delirious, but in my opinion, that's the best way to get a person to click on, read more and start reading rather than giving a generic statement. Or some sort of, sometimes I see people even putting the titles like we have titles on our blogs and they put them as a title of their post. And I'm saying, you just wasted one or two lines. You wasted it because you know I actually didn't get to read the whole sentence after that, because it got cut off.

[00:12:27.250] - Juliette
And so, my brain just was scroll by. The brain doesn't want to work, so we will only work if it's worth it. And if it only becomes worth it when suddenly we recognize ourselves. So, our, you know brain starts liking up and wants more of this. So, it's all about getting the person to crave a little more. And we need to get away from generic statements and start with just illustrate. Like, imagine, tell them to imagine something. Ask them a question that illustrates something that was in their lives.

[00:13:01.450] - Juliette
For example, one of my clients just wrote a post and I really loved the opening. And she said, who were you when you married your partner? Were you still the same person? And that opens up who you know kind of warms in a way because you start saying, am I still the same person because my husband. And then you start reading to make sure that you are or you're not. And if not, then get some sort of help. And the post gave a lot of you know valuable tips for those people who were not very happy.

[00:13:31.450] - Juliette
But it was the triggering question that stopped the scroll. I actually stopped my scroll before I even realized it was from my clients. So that's exactly what I'm talking about in terms of social media. I'll give you another good example. When next morning, tomorrow, or maybe today, you're scrolling mindlessly on Facebook. And then you stop, something made you read, just kind of ask yourself, what was it? Why am I reading this? So, was it something how they opened the post? What was it? Was it a picture?

[00:14:07.150] - Juliette
That's another, you said images. Was it an image? Was there something in the image and even a selfie can do that if there is a really nice selfie. All my visuals are selfies because I really love them. And I'm also a control freak. And no photographer can get inside my head. It seems. But if you take a selfie with that energy that you are writing your post, maybe that energy alone can trigger the person. And just you know we work on intuitive level a lot. It's not always about strategies or exact words or anything.

[00:14:39.730] - Juliette
It's just sometimes you can see something and something just makes you read more. But that's another way that you can consider what is the image that comes with this? Is it an image of you? Is it some sort of like a graphic that is very interesting. Maybe you wrote an article full of tips and you want to add a graphic that has the best tips listed, and that you know creates some sort of interest straight away as well. If it's relevant, obviously to the reader. Does it make sense?

[00:15:08.590] - Interviewer
Yes. Yes

[00:15:09.250] - Interviewer
No, it does.

[00:15:10.990] - Interviewer
So, because Facebook, the Facebook feed feel like a lot of stuff can get lost in it.

[00:15:18.370] - Interviewer
It doesn't even get shown you know.

[00:15:21.070] - Interviewer
So, what sort of frequency would you say people should be posting on Facebook to try to actually be seen in that feed?

[00:15:29.590] - Juliette
To be honest with you, they're kind of two legs to this to being seen. One is the frequency. And yes, you have to post daily. If somebody tells you that you don't need to post daily, that's too much work, blah, blah, blah. They're just feeding into your need of not being there. Right? But the truth is that when we ask ourselves you know, if you have to do a quiz. I say something and you need to respond straight away what came into your mind? If I say fast food, you probably will say McDonald's, right?

[00:16:05.690] - Juliette
Why? Because McDonald's ads are everywhere. Even if you never go to McDonald's, you will still say McDonald's for fast food. Why? Everywhere, side of the bus, you know every kind of like stops, stations, you know side of the shops. But they are not promoting deals. They're just saying "McDonald's, I'm loving it". It's called an awareness campaign. So, when they have their $1 deal or whatever, it sits on top of the awareness campaign, and that becomes very effective in terms of marketing and client attraction. It's just constantly being there when you're posting frequently.

[00:16:42.710] - Juliette
And it's not as hard because we have a lot of tools that allow us to automate. We can take a piece of content and create loads of little small pieces of content. This is probably, you know we might talk about it, but this might be a topic for another kind of talk. But you know when you're approaching it strategically, you don't need to work that hard. But you need to make sure that you're there all the time, because if you are not there all the time, then you're not on top of mind of people who are mindlessly scrolling.

[00:17:07.550] - Juliette
Facebook is not an enemy. Facebook algorithm is not some horrendous invention that stops people from seeing you. Most of the time, the truth is that you haven't been consistent. And you're also not engaging with people who are engaging with you. You know there's a lot of things that you can do as a user, become a little bit more active. And just block your time in the morning when you're scrolling mindlessly, right, you can also use ten minutes that you just go into your post and see if anyone liked.

[00:17:38.810] - Juliette
You go to their profiles like go to their profiles and like their last post and connect to your audience that way. So, if you show Facebook algorithm that you're an active user, you're kind of going to get a little bit more love as well. And that's the second leg. One leg post daily, create consistently, be that McDonald's ad on the side. So, your name, it doesn't matter what you say. Post a funny picture. Post a picture of your puppy. It doesn't matter what you're posting. It's about being there all the time.

[00:18:09.830] - Juliette
That's why staying visible is easy. Of course, you want to be strategic about it. Of course, you want to share, you know authority. You mentioned earlier. You know your fancy words don't make you an authority. But if you, for example, wrote a guest article and submitted to, maybe I don't know, Addicted to Success, or Medium.com, or entrepreneur became a contributor. That's authority, right? So, you can use that to occasionally repost things that build up your authority. And that's a piece of content. So, again, you're there. And for me, if I'm a relevant person to you know the person that you want to attract, maybe I don't know you.

[00:18:48.170] - Juliette
First, I don't care. You know I scroll by, but over time I start seeing you more and more and more, and there was, maybe really good openings on your post that made me read. Even if I wasn't interested, it was just that line made me click on Read More. For Facebook, clicking on Read More button is a form of engagement. For us, we think that only comments and likes. And if nobody comments and likes, it's like drama, because there's no engagement. But there is engagements, people who are serious about you.

[00:19:16.430] - Juliette
And especially, if you're writing really good posts, like really valuable. A lot of people actually just go and consume that information and it sinks deep, deep in. But they forget to comment or like, which is still okay because they clicked on Read More and they read the whole post. So, there is a way of manipulating the algorithm, but just make it to your best friend because it can be. It's only a piece of code. It's not there, it's not there to prevent anyone from seeing anyone. This is just you know kind of like some marketers use this scary discourse.

[00:19:51.110] - Juliette
It's not true, but you can use it to your most advantage. And of course, the more frequent you are, the more you're engaging with other people, the more you're focusing on one thing. That's why you know I said to at least straight away, I'm a Facebook girl. Don't ask me about LinkedIn. Don't ask me about Instagram or any other platforms because I made a decision four years ago when I turned into online marketing and I had a digital marketing agency. And I knew, I used all these other platforms, too, for my clients.

[00:20:21.350] - Juliette
But for me, I said, I need a platform. I need to be in one place, but that place going to be Juliet's domain. And it was my personal profile because I could send people friend requests. And you know I could produce content. I don't do any sort of outreaches, spammy techniques. I just write. And I go live or you know I do interviews. And I let people observe and the right ones, they self-identify the right ones. They want more of me. They want to binge on Juliet. So, they go into my blog and they go into my website and they find my offers and they become clients, some of them.

[00:20:58.670] - Juliette
So, this is turning into this kind of funnel. So, you can take the same approach and turn it into a funnel on your blog where you do all the monetization. 

[00:21:10.010] - Interviewer
Yes. Okay. So I did want to ask really quickly, are you using ads to be seen more at all?

[00:21:17.510] - Interviewer
Does that come in?

[00:21:18.530] - Interviewer
When would that come into play?

[00:21:21.110] - Juliette
I will be honest with you. No, but I wasted a lot of money on ads. So, there is a no for two reasons. One reason is because I market, I position myself as an organic marketing coach. So, you know if I was running a lot of ads and said, let's do it all organically. It was kind of go against me. But I did. And I have sometimes, and I sometimes even now do use ads a little bit to boost you know my visibility a little bit. But it's always a waste of money for me. This is as transparent as it gets. Because the truth is that I think maybe for the blog, if you were, if it's, maybe it's not a really personal blog, it's more kind of you know valuable.

[00:21:59.970] - Juliette
It could work to use the ad. But you would only want to use ads when you have a completely proven validated method of monetizing or getting clients from what you are writing. When you have done this with your organic, so free visibility. And you know that, okay. So when they come and they click on this particular, maybe call to action to this blog article, then they come there. And then I have maybe three suggested articles that are relative and it feels like they click here. And they come to this article and then they sign up to my freebie and they get onto my list from this article.

[00:22:35.370] - Juliette
And so, I can actually create an ad that brings more people that are relevant to this article. Because I know that from this article, they come and they enter here and they go here. So, when you know how you get your clients or how you make money, then you can put money behind it. Sometimes, and this was, again, I'm very, very honest. I'm like straight talker. I am extremely fluid in my marketing. And I love it because I test and try so many different things, especially with organic marketing. And sometimes, I have clients that are coming in one way, and sometimes clients coming in the other way.

[00:23:13.450] - Juliette
I don't have in my business that just like one way I get clients. They go in and sign up to this masterclass, and that's how they go. And this is why, for me, every time I'm using ads, it just doesn't make sense because I'm not scaling. So, there's the word you need to use ads when you want to scale the results that you're already consistently getting with free content. That's my opinion. Again, you know like, experts in this world of coaching and marketing, everybody has their own opinion. There's no right or wrong strategy.

[00:23:45.190] - Juliette
You are here to figure out your own unique strategy, just wanted to put it out there. But this is one of the approaches. You know, maybe do it organically and you can. Yes. Yes. Start that way anyway. You have to start that way. Because when you are starting, you don't yet know who you're targeting. You might decide, but you don't yet know, you know what. If you're actually reaching them. Yeah, yeah, it's a process. And I know a lot of programs they decide on your ideal clients. And the ideal clients is something you discover over the course of your, you know, many years.

[00:24:21.070] - Juliette
To be honest with you, it gets clear and clearer. You pivot. So, it's sometimes very difficult, especially, and that's why there's a lot of money wasting happens with ads that we don't know. You know if I say that I want to target coaches. It's such a huge area. But what about these other things? The particular people who like particular things, who like my energy. So for me, audience growing would be much more doing interviews, writing, you know sharing. So, if you're really, writing is your thing, you're a blogger, then make sure that you're not only staying on your platform, your own blog, that you're going.

[00:24:55.690] - Juliette
Even if you're just simply republished the same stuff to medium.com, you are reaching new people. You know if you have other platforms where maybe you know you don't need to write original content, but you're reaching more people with the same piece, so.

[00:25:11.830] - Interviewer
I have two more questions.

[00:25:13.810] - Interviewer
So, my question is kind of where, you know because you're tracking them with those first few lines so that they hit Read More. Where does your call to action come into play? What kind of call to action would be most effective?

[00:25:24.130] - Interviewer
I know it kind of depends on your offer. But, for you know.

[00:25:25.630] - Juliette
For bloggers. It's a really good question because it kind of has to do with what type of content Facebook hates. Facebook hates links. So, if your call to action is read more here, Facebook is going to do whatever it can to the algorithm, in that case, is not going to like. Because you're sending people away from the platform. So, Facebook wants everyone to stay on Facebook. But the platform, the algorithm is not intelligent enough to even figure out that maybe you're sending them into your group. So, every time you add a link into your call to action, your visibility naturally will be the least possible you know, so.

[00:26:06.950] - Juliette
My trick is that my call to action, you don't have to write really long posts. You can just, if you wrote a really good article, think about how can this what I just talked about be illustrated in somebody's life. You know some sort of frustration or something, start with that. That will be your trigger. And then you can just say, I just finished this article that I go through this, this, and this, and explain how to do this and this and this link is in the comments. If you love it, come back and give me you know gif in the comments or something like that, or do you want it?

[00:26:42.230] - Juliette
That's one of the ways. And then you put the link in the comments. And another one, if you want to build engagement, there's a tactic for you. You can say I just wrote this, put the juiciest, you know, points. Do you want it? And they have to say yes. And then you send the link either you can post the link as a reply. But I sometimes go one step further because you want to engage all the possible tools that Facebook has and messenger tool is a great tool.

[00:27:13.010] - Juliette
So, instead of putting the link publicly and then everybody else doesn't want to engage with me because they saw the link and they just clicked there. I can say, hey, great, I'm sending it to you. And then I go to this person's messenger and I say, hey, thanks, Amelia. There is the article. So, I triggered a messenger. I made a personal connection. I don't have to go into any pitching. I don't have to go into any chats. Trust me, I'm someone who doesn't like talking to strangers at all.

[00:27:40.190] - Juliette
And they call me the Queen of visibility, right. And I'm a Facebook girl. So, it's possible even when you're an introvert and all these things. But the personal connection means a lot. So, if you send a message, the person feels great. Facebook likes the fact that you used messenger and you know what, every time you can actually experiment. Next time you send a message to someone that you haven't spoken for a while. If they are active on Facebook, you will start seeing their posts in your newsfeed for the next week or two because it triggers because it says these two users, they're very close.

[00:28:11.450] - Juliette
We need to show them more of their content. So, it's really, really good for you. And it builds engagement and it builds connection with your audience. So that's something that you can also do. That would be a strategy. 

[00:28:21.470] - Interviewer
Yeah. No, I love that. I've already got ideas going.

[00:28:27.450] - Juliette
Don't put links into, don't say, here's the article, there is a link because it's going to, you know it just reduces your visibility. What you can do is after a couple of days, you can go back to the post and add the article to the main body because the whole algorithm scanning it and deciding, you know that's all kind of finished now. If you want to do it, but it's perfectly okay in the comments. 

[00:28:49.950] - Interviewer
Okay. No, I like that.

[00:28:51.390] - Interviewer
Okay.

[00:28:51.750] - Interviewer
So, we talked about sort of repurposing with this stuff, but how long does it take you to do this kind of marketing?

[00:28:58.590] - Interviewer
Really.

[00:28:59.010] - Interviewer
Especially if you want to do a daily opportunity.

[00:29:00.630] - Interviewer
You can batch and schedule and stuff. But how long are you spending kind of creating this content and getting it scheduled for Facebook?

[00:29:09.210] - Juliette
Well, let's put it this way. I am Facebook marketer first, blogger, 15th, so I usually write on Facebook. And my posts are like blogs, and I take them and they just tweak slightly and put them onto my blog. So, I do it all in reverse. Whatever time it takes you to create your piece of content, say, for example, you're writing a blog post. So, whatever time you spent on that, that's your time for the creation. What you need to be is strategic while you're writing this. And I know a lot of publications require that as well.

[00:29:44.010] - Juliette
When you pitch an article to them is think about a couple of blurbs. You know a couple of blurbs what your article is about, but keep my advice you know in mind. Try and make it like to do with everyday life stuff or people's thoughts or some sort of inner feelings. Try and present what you did in the article to do with the person's inner world or everyday life. And that would be your blurbs. So, if you wrote an article while you're in that creative process, write two or three blurbs. And those are the two or three blurbs you can use to promote this article to open your social media post.

[00:30:20.610] - Juliette
So, you don't need to do to write a lot of stuff for the social media post. You can just juicy, you know introduction, create a niche graphic. Maybe you already have a promotion of your blog and then post this. But in reply to a question, how often or how long I have to do this, in terms of how long the process of your marketing is every day. Marketing is not an A to B. Marketing is a journey like it's a process. It's like a habit that you have like you brush your teeth.

[00:30:51.570] - Juliette
If you want to have healthy mouth, you brush your teeth. If you want to have healthy business, you market you know. And if you want to you know make money or attract clients or attract just people reading your stuff, you need to do it every day. But not every day needs to be groundbreaking as I said. So, it doesn't take long. I love memes. I have a cool collection of my phone. Every time, I see a meme, I'm like I'm stealing this because you know humor means a lot to me. So, I use that on some days and that builds much more engagement and you will notice that. And don't take it personally.

[00:31:25.110] - Juliette
If post about your blog doesn't get as much engagement as a photograph of your puppy. Because that's normal. Because that's what social media is about. It's easy to, you know it's easy to engage. It doesn't require thinking. You know it's just kind of impossible. So that's fine. So, we use those posts that are easy to engage. Jokes, heads, you know whatever your passions are. I don't use religion and politics, but if that's your thing, do that. And that builds your engagement. Next day, you give them a serious post to your blog because a lot of people will see on the back.

[00:31:59.910] - Juliette
It's like surfing, right? So, you're surfing the wave of engagement. But what happens after they've engaged with, maybe meaningless post. Give them something more serious, but they will see it. And they will click on that Read More. The right ones, they will click on that Read More button. They will go and check out if you have links in the comments and they'll do everything you are asking them to do, provided they're the people you're targeting, and it's relevant to them. Because they will see it on the back of your question, earlier question about how do we get seen it's this kind of riding this wave and making sure that you're not just oh, just my blog.

[00:32:30.570] - Juliette
My blog, my blog, me, me, me. But it's also a little bit of you know who you are. There's my puppy. Ther's memes. Whatever lights you up, put it out there. And that creates a daily content as well. So, it doesn't actually take that much time. And it's fun.

[00:32:48.630] - Interviewer
Okay. No, I like that.

[00:32:50.490] - Interviewer
Yeah, because marketing is a lot easier to do if you're enjoying.

[00:32:54.990] - Juliette
I think that it's very important. And I don't know if you heard about human design. It's a little human design. It's all about the energy and the aura and the personality. It's something that is a permission to be you. And for some people, depending on their human design type, my type is a projector, which means I have an aura like this. And I need to project myself. I need to be there. I need to be enjoying myself. If I'm doing something I don't enjoy, I'm going to repel clients.

[00:33:23.610] - Juliette
I'm going to repel people because somehow on intuitive level, they can feel that. And so, you can. And this is like I testified that you can simplify the way you do your marketing and only do things that you really enjoy or things that you don't mind doing. And you can actually say no to things that feel horrendous to you because there's no one way to get there. And as long as you're enjoying it, that energy will be with your content. And so, it will attract people on that energetic level. And it's absolutely okay to say no.

[00:33:58.710] - Juliette
So, yeah. Marketing can be absolutely easy. 

[00:34:02.670] - Interviewer
Yes, yes. Okay. So, where can people learn more about you?
