Hey everyone. I hope you've been enjoying the presentations you've watched so far. It's surreal that I'm speaking at the Blogger Breakthrough Summit because it was the first ever virtual summit I attended. And so it feels like I've come full circle. I want to say a quick thank you to Liz for asking me to be a speaker. And I hope you will enjoy my presentation. So my presentation today is about accessible blogging and how to write content for every reader. And what I mean by every reader is including disabled people, people with different learning styles, and everyone, literally everyone, and not leaving anyone out. Here's a quick overview of what I'll be talking about today. I'll start by explaining what online accessibility is. Then I'll talk about why you need to care about it. The next part is about the five accessibility features that every blog post must have. And I'll also be sharing the best practices for each feature. And then to finish, I'll do a quick summary. But first, it might help if I introduce myself. Hello, I'm Ami. I'm an online accessibility consultant, and I help bloggers and online business owners by providing actionable tips and resources on how to implement online accessibility best practices without feeling overwhelmed.

[00:02:08.380] - Ami Hook Ireland
I do want to put a disclaimer out there, as I'm not a legal expert, and all the information I provide is based on my own personal experiences with inaccessibility and what I've learned about online accessibility over the years. That's one variant of my business, and the other is that I also create PLR, which is Private Label Rights products, such as printable and digital journals and planners, custom Canva frames, and lots of other different things as well. I'm a mom to a three-year-old girl version of Sonic the Hedgehog, and I'm married to the man I hated when I first met him over a decade ago. I have multiple disabilities. I have hearing loss, central vision loss, sensory ataxia, and transverse myelitis. I do have more, but it'd probably take up the rest of my presentation trying to explain them. Now, if you're wondering why on earth I'm wearing a horned headpiece in my photo? It's because I am a massive, massive fan of Loki and Tom Hiddleston. And my lifelong, well, okay, only not a year long, dream came through in 2021 when I met Tom at MCM, Comic Con in London. It was an amazing day, it really was.

[00:03:57.820] - Ami Hook Ireland
Anyway, moving on quickly before I get carried away talking about Loki and all that. Let's get started. What is online accessibility? Online accessibility is making websites and any form of digital content and products easy to use and understand for everyone, including disabled people. This then enables us to navigate the online space independently. For example, as I have hearing loss, I need post captions and transcripts to understand what is being said in videos. Another example, as I have central vision loss, I need font to be very clear, have a high contrast, which I'll explain more about shortly, and paragraphs to be broken up so they're not this massive block of text and don't put too much strain on my eyes. There are so many examples, but at the end of the day, accessibility is making something easier for people with accessibility needs to be able to access it like everyone else. And speaking of everyone, accessibility does affect everyone, including you, because say, for example, you find it easier to listen to a podcast version of a blog post. You can then access the content in a format that's easier and more convenient to you. And that's accessibility in a nutshell.

[00:05:54.170] - Ami Hook Ireland
It doesn't just apply to disabled people, it benefits everyone. Because we all learn and take in information in different ways. And let's move on to why you need to care about accessibility. Now, there are so many different reasons why you need to care, and I have two big statistics I'm going to share with you. The first one is how many people there are worldwide who have some degree of sight loss. How many do you reckon there are? Maybe tens or hundreds of thousands. According to the World Health Organization, there are 2.2 billion people worldwide who have some degree of sight loss. So things like not providing alt text for images in your blog post or not having a good color contrast between the background and the text, things like that mean you are potentially excluding up to 2.2 billion people from your content. Another statistic I founds from a charity called Mencap in the UK, which is for people with learning disabilities. So according to Mencap in the UK alone, there are 1.5 million people with a learning disability. Now, people with learning disability also benefit from alt text as some use the screen reader, which is a type of assistive technology that reads aloud text that's on the screen.

[00:07:53.700] - Ami Hook Ireland
Another thing is not using plain and simple words when writing. If you use a lot of big, complex technical words, then you're all potentially excluding 1.5 million people with a learning disability, and that's just in the UK. I reckon worldwide it could be billions. Now, I know these statistics are a lot to take in, and I want you to know it's never my intention to make you feel bad when I share statistics like these. But it is important to know why things need to be accessible and who they impact. But you are doing the right thing by being here and learning from what I'm sharing today. It shows you care about accessibility. It shows you want to learn about it, and it shows you want to take action. I know accessibility isn't the sexiest of topics, but it is a very important one. Just to remind you, I'm not a legal expert, so I can't give you any legal advice about accessibility. That being said, it is important to know that in some countries, it is a legal requirement to have an accessible website. I have included a list of the countries that I'm aware of where accessibility is a legal requirement in the resources part of my free gift.

[00:09:33.580] - Ami Hook Ireland
But at the end of the day to do your own research on it. And I've talked about some of the less positive consequences of inaccessibility. So let's look at the positives and how writing with accessibility in mind can have a huge positive impact on your blog and business. You can reach a wider audience by making your content accessible. This helps increase your page views and your blog and your brand become more visible. So more people know how awesome you and your content are. It can also increase conversions. So by sharing the accessibility of something, for example, a course you're promoting in your blog post and saying what format it's in, you'll increase the chances of people buying through your link. Because people want to know this and they want content in format that's successful and convenient to them. At the end of the day, you don't know what you don't know and you don't know all the needs of every reader that lands on your blog. It also shows that you and your brand value inclusion, and you're aware that everybody is different and that we all have different needs and we don't all fit in with the same status quo.

[00:11:20.030] - Ami Hook Ireland
But the most important reason is that it's simply the right thing to do. It's horrible feeling excluded and not being able to access the same things as everyone else. But all these negative things and feelings can be prevented by making your content accessible. And it can be done quite easily when there's straightforward instructions on how to do it. And this is what I'll be talking about now. So you're going to find out the five accessibility features every blog post must have. Now, a little heads up, I'll try to create a fun way to hopefully help you remember these five features. You're about to read five acronyms and what they stand for. What are five accessibility features every blog post must have? The first acronym is D.A.T, which stands for Descriptive Alt Text. The second is GOAT, which stands for Good and Obvious Anchor Text. The third acronym is EARL, which stands for Everyone Appreciates Readable Language. The fourth is MEANS, which stands for Mighty Ease And No Squinting, which is relevant to color contrast. And the last acronym is CHAOS, which stands for Clear Headings and Organized Structure. In essence, DAT GOAT EARL MEANS CHAOS will increase the accessibility of your blog post, and it is very easy to do.

[00:13:34.990] - Ami Hook Ireland
There you go, DAT GOAT EARL MEANS CHAOS. Now you know the five features, it would help to know more about them and their best practices. That's what we'll move on to next. Let's start on with alt text. What on Earth is it? Alt text is the description of an image. For example, let's go back to the photo of me and Tom Hiddleston. The alt text would be, Ami is in her wheelchair on one side of the screen with Tom Hiddleston kneeling on one knee on the other side. They have one hand against the screen, which makes it look like their hands are touching. Okay, so alt text is essentially what is happening in the image. Now, a shorter and more concise version could be, Ami and Tom Hiddleston holding hands against each side of the screen. And both are acceptable versions of alttext. Here are some things to avoid when writing alt text. Keyword stuffing, it makes alt text unreadable for screen reader users, and it does appear as spammy, which can also negatively affect SEO. For example, the photo of me and Tom, keyword stuffing for that would look like Loki actor, MCM, comic-con, Tom Hiddleston, fan meets Tom Hiddleston.

[00:15:36.860] - Ami Hook Ireland
It don't really give an accurate description of the image. Another is starting with image of. This is because screen readers announce that an image is coming, so starting with image of just adds unnecessary repetition. Another is repeating the same information as it doesn't provide any new information, and it can be quite confusing. Type in blank, spacer, or empty, and in your alt text, it doesn't really convey any useful information of the image. And relying on the file name like image002.png, it's not exactly going to help anyone as it doesn't give any context about the image. Now, what you can do is be descriptive as it helps users understand the image and how it's relevant to the content. Another is to be concise and keep it short and to the point. So it offers enough detail for understanding without being overly wordy. Now, I know it's difficult to be descriptive and concise at the same time. Even I still struggle sometimes. But as long as you keep practicing, you will find a nice balance between the two. Also include important details. So these are things like what is happening and what it's being shown in the way it is, including key details like these make the image more meaningful and it helps readers engage with the content more.

[00:17:54.960] - Ami Hook Ireland
You can include one or two keywords, as it not only helps readers understand the topic of an image, but it can also improve the image's SEO. It can also consider the overall context of an image. So what you need to think about is how the image fits into the overall context of what you're writing about in your blog post, and make sure that your alt text complements that context. So for example, the photo of me and Tom, because my readers know by my blog post that I'm a massive fan, I would also include in my alt text that I was internally squealing like a happy pig in mud. Adding that little extra context to my alt text helps to convey the image and how it's relevant to what I've been writing about. And it provides the reader with the reading experience that flows and just makes complete sense. Moving on to anchor text. What is the anchor text? It's the clickable text in a hyperlink. Now, let's get straight into what to avoid. A big one is to not use generic text like, 'Click here', as it doesn't tell readers about where the link will take them.

[00:19:59.990] - Ami Hook Ireland
Whenever I see a hyperlink that says, Click here, I automatically think, Am I going to Narnia or Asgaard? I want to know where you're taking me. Another is to not mislead. So for example, if the anchor text says free download, and it turns out that you're taking me to a subscription form, this would then make me frustrated. It would make me feel like your content is less trustworthy. So it's always important to give the correct information. Also, avoid using the raw URLs as the anchor text as it doesn't really give any descriptive information, making it look like the same as the rest of the text in your blog post. The readers might not recognize the hyperlink, which can then lead to missed opportunities for the reader to engage with the content and to not use all capitals as it can appear as aggressive and it is harder to read. What you can do is be descriptive as it helps readers understand where the link will take them and what to expect. You need to be concise and keep it short as it makes it easier to scan and read your content. And it also improves the reader experience.

[00:22:07.760] - Ami Hook Ireland
Keep it relevant. Ensure that the anchor text is directly related to the content of the linked page. It's best practice to include the main keyword as it adds value to the context and can also boost SEO. Now, if you have lots of links in your blog post, consider changing the anchor text to prevent confusion and ensure that the anchor text for each link is different enough to avoid readers getting confused. Next up is Readability, which is making sure content is easy to read and understand. It's as simple as that. One thing to avoid is assuming that your audience is familiar with the topic you're talking about, and having the same level of knowledge as you do, at the end of the day, they're there to learn from you, and they want it explained in a simple and easy to understand way. Try to avoid overly long sentences, as these can come across as quite complex and confuse readers and just make it difficult to understand. Another big one is using unnecessary big words, because every time I come across a big word that I've never heard of before or I don't know the meaning of, I go straight to Google to find out what it means.

[00:24:11.820] - Ami Hook Ireland
Nine times out of 10, I usually forget to go back to the page I was reading. So it's always important to simplify the words you use if possible. Don't be afraid of using image or two as they can simplify difficult concepts and make the overall content more accessible and engaging. What you can do is use clear and simple words as these improve content accessibility and understanding. For example, instead of using the word convoluted, just say difficult, simple as that. You can use lists and bullet points as these help to break up the content and make it much easier to scan and take in information from your content. I always recommend using short paragraphs, so four or five lines maximum, as these are much easier to read. Make use of the white space around text to make it much easier and more comfortable on the eyes, and it also improves how your content is presented. And use a consistent format. So by maintaining the same structure throughout your content in terms of fonts, styles, and sizes, that consistent format helps your content to flow, and it's much easier to read. Next up is color contrast, which is the difference between light and dark.

[00:26:23.450] - Ami Hook Ireland
Some things to avoid are using similar colors. Low-colour contrast can make content hard to read, and it is inaccessible to some readers. For example, black text on a dark gray background, it's just completely inaccessible, really difficult to read. Another is to not rely on colors to explain something, so don't rely solely on color to convey information or meaning in your content as it can exclude people who are colorblind and they can't visually understand the information correctly. So for example, the crosses and ticks I've been using in the best practices slides if I just had them as the cross and the tick without the words next to them. To someone with color blindness that would come across as the same colors, so it's not really giving them the accurate information I'm trying to get across. Try to avoid using the same colors for the hover and focus of a hyperlink. So for example, a link that changes color when hovered, but doesn't show any visual indicator of the focus. It's not easy to tell the difference between the two. So it's always important to make sure hover and Focus Colors are very different from one another.

[00:28:33.480] - Ami Hook Ireland
Another thing is to not ignore accessibility standards like WCAG, which is the Web Content Accessibility Guideline. I can't remember the exact number of what the color contrast needs to be to meet accessibility standards, but I have put the number in the resource as part of my free gift, as I've included with color contrast checker. What you can do is use very clear and distinct colors. For example, dark black text on a bright white background like on my slide. Use color contrast checkers like I just mentioned, and these will quickly tell you and verify that the colors you're using comply with accessibility standards. Do try and understand that not all types of vision loss the same. Understanding these differences helps you to make content accessible to broader range of people. You can provide the content in a different format. For example, if you have an infographic and it's represented by different colors, provide text underneath the image to explain what those colors represent. It will help the reader to understand the infographic better. Last step is headings and structure, which are used to create an easy to follow format. Some things to avoid are overly long heading as these can turn out quite complex and be overwhelming for the reader.

[00:30:55.020] - Ami Hook Ireland
Try not to skip the heading hierarchy, which is basically the order of headings that they need to follow. By skipping these heading levels, it can confuse readers and it disrupts the flow of the content. Try not to use too many different colors, fonts, and sizes in your blog content. For example, using five different fonts and colors for various heading, it comes across as inconsistent and also appear as disorganized. But try not to overuse heading levels unless necessary. For example, using every heading level in a short form blog post, it doesn't really make sense to use them and ends up complicating the content. What you can do is use descriptive headings as these help readers to quickly understand the content's main point. Make sure you follow the heading hierarchy, which is the order of headings, so H1, H2, and then H3, and so on. This helps to structure the content and makes it more organized and easier to understand. Try to keep the structure of your content the same. And by using the same font size and color for all the headings and subheadings. By making all of this consistent, it improves the appearance and readability of your content.

[00:33:09.890] - Ami Hook Ireland
You can use subheadings to break down complex content into more manageable sections. This then helps make the content scannable and helps the reader to go through the content more smoothly. Finally, ensure there's white space as it makes the content less crowded and improves overall readability. I know there was a lot to pack in one presentation, so if you need a quick summary of what I've covered today, here you go. Online accessibility is about making websites and any form of content easy to use and understand, not only for disabled people, but people with different learning styles too. You need to care about accessibility because by not making your content accessible, you could be excluding billions of people. In some countries, it is a legal requirement, but there are lots of positive effects that making things accessible can have. It helps you to reach a wider audience. It can increase conversion rate, and you and your brand will be known for caring. Last but not least, DAT GOAT EARL MEANS CHAOS. I hope these acronyms will help you to remember the five features every blog post must have. Again, which are 'descriptive alt text', 'good, and obvious anchor text'.

[00:35:12.550] - Ami Hook Ireland
'Everyone appreciates readable language', 'mighty ease and no squinting', which is related to color contrast, and finally, 'clear headings and organized structure'. Remember, DAT GOAT EARL MEANS CHAOS. We also covered the best practices for each of the five accessibility features, which I won't address them here because there were quite a lot. But we have definitely covered so much today, and I really hope you've learned a thing or two from my presentation. As mentioned a few times, I am providing a free gift, which you can get somewhere on the page that this video is on. I've included lots more examples, the tools I use, and reliable resources that I've trusted for years. I hope you find all that helpful too. One final thing I want to say is that accessibility is not a do it once and forget type of thing. It is ongoing and it does require you to be proactive with learning, implement and accessibility. I can promise you it's not all technical, it's not all that difficult once it's explained clearly and in simple and plain words, that's basically what I'm here for. That's what my business is about. I want to help you understand it in a way that actually helps.

[00:37:01.030] - Ami Hook Ireland
I think that's everything. So thank you so very much for attending my presentation today. And again, I hope you've learned a few things. And if you do sign up for my free gift, then I can't wait to get to know you. Thanks again to Liz for asking me to speak at the summit. It's a surreal experience, and it's absolutely a huge milestone in my online business journey. Thanks again, and I need a drink now after talking for however long. Bye for now.

**Transcript:**
Cousett Hoover [00:00:12]:
Welcome. Welcome to the Blogger Breakthrough Summit. I'm so excited to be here. Our session today is beyond the trifecta, integrating web accessibility for multiple wins. Really quickly, a disclaimer. I'm not a lawyer so we will not be tackling the consequences of not having an accessible website in this session. Instead, we're gonna dive into what you can do to make your site as accessible as possible. Before we get started, a little bit about me.

Cousett Hoover [00:00:40]:
Welcome to the techy mama world. Back in the eighties, I was born in Silicon Valley that pretty much made me a tech girl from day 1. I made it official around 2005 with a degree and have been designing, developing, and teaching technology ever since. My other passion is teaching. And before kids, I was a dissertation away from a PhD in educational technology. Now I'm on a mission to empower mompreneurs to automate, build, and scale their business. I started Techie Mamma as a small blog with a newborn in tow. Since then, it has grown and flourished into so much more.

Cousett Hoover [00:01:17]:
I have 2 incredible screen addicted Minecraft expert boys who are 8 and 6. My husband is also a leader in the open source community of WordPress, Drupal, and much more. Together, we compete over our Wi Fi connection in suburbia of Central Texas, Silicon Hills area. You can dive more into the Techie Mamma world on social or by joining our BFF community. Scan the QR code to get all the deets. Enough about me. Let's dive in because I can't wait to learn more about your journey. Today, we're going to talk about web accessibility.

Cousett Hoover [00:01:52]:
Web accessibility is a huge topic with a full conferences devoted to it. We're going to touch just the tip of the iceberg. But by the end of this session, you'll be able to identify problems people may have when using the web, identify the benefits of universal design, understand the four principles that define the web content accessibility guidelines or WCAG 2.2, identify other compliance documents, learn how to apply some things to improve your accessibility of your website, and understand how assistive technologies are used with the web and understand basic testing and some tools. So web accessibility and universal design. Web accessibility involves a wide range of disabilities, including visual, auditory, physical, speech, cognitive, learning, and neurological disabilities. Universal design is also important to make web content more usable by older individuals with changing abilities due to aging and often improve usability for users in general. Let's consider some statistics and talk about the relevance of web accessibility today. 15%, at least 1,000,000,000 people of the global population have a recognized disability.

Cousett Hoover [00:03:15]:
28.7%. More than 1 in 4 adults in the United States have some type of disability and a reduced ability to carry out normal activities. 46%. Worldwide, more than 46% of people ages 60 and older live with a disability. The Microsoft app a Microsoft app developer guide says designing inclusive software results in improved usability and customer satisfaction. Let's talk about how this is good for everyone no matter if your audience has any disabilities or not. So that is inclusive design. With inclusive design, there is an expanded audience reach.

Cousett Hoover [00:04:03]:
It unlocks an audience of 16% or more of the global population with disabilities. Keeping web accessibility in mind, if we look at some percentages, it includes 5.5% of US adults who have a vision disability with blindness or serious difficulty seeing seeing even when wearing glasses. We want to make sure that screen readers are able to speak content, there's sufficient contrast, information, and information that's not dependent on color alone. We have 12.2 percent of US adults who have a mobility disability. That's serious difficulty walking or climbing stairs. It can be due to a tremor or disease. In web design, we want to make sure that content is keyboard accessible and can be accessed also by voice or an alternative device. 6.2% of US adults are deaf or have serious difficulty hearing.

Cousett Hoover [00:05:06]:
The implication for web design is that transcripts need to be provided for all content and captions for video content. Then cognition disabilities. We have 13.9% of US adults that have serious difficulty concentrating, remembering, or making decisions. In web design, consistent navigation, high contrast, and well organized content can really help. The most probable problematic issues on the web include complex page layouts, content that is unreadable when enlarged, poor contrast, CAPTCHA forms, pop up windows or dialog boxes, complex or difficult forms, too many links or navigation items, missing or improper headings and poor keyboard accessibility. Alright, so let's talk about the guidelines. That's what makes it the law. So there are various guidelines and laws in various countries.

Cousett Hoover [00:06:10]:
We're going to dive into the global guidelines which are the web content accessibility guidelines. They're at the version of 2.2. They define how to make web content more accessible to people with disabilities. Other countries have their own compliance laws in relation to web accessibility as well. The web content accessibility guidelines have 4 main principles. So our first principle is perceivable. We want information and user and the user interface components must be presentable to users in ways they can perceive. We want to make sure that text alternatives are available for non text content, provide captions and other alternatives for multimedia, create content that can be presented in different ways including by assistive technology without losing meaning and make it easier for users to see and hear content.

Cousett Hoover [00:07:08]:
Our second principle is operable. User interface components and navigation must be operable. You want to make sure all functionality is available from the keyboard. Give users enough time to read and use the content, not use content that causes seizures or physical reactions. Help users navigate and find content. Make it easier to use inputs other than the keyboard. Our third principle is understandable. Information and the operation of the user interface must be understandable.

Cousett Hoover [00:07:43]:
You wanna make sure that the text is readable and understandable. Make content appear and operate in predictable ways and help users avoid and correct mistakes. And lastly, we have robust. Content must be robust enough that it can be interpreted by a wide variety of user agents, including assistive technologies. We wanna maximize compatibility with current and future user tools. So there are even more documents of compliance. In the US, we have the American Disabilities Act and section 508, which defines the scope of responsibilities for accessibility in the US Federal Government. In Canada, there's various other ones including the Accessible Canada Act, and the Ontarians with Disabilities Act.

Cousett Hoover [00:08:36]:
In Europe, there's the European Accessibility Act, which goes into effect, June 28th this year. It's going to be a national law in all 27 EU member states. There's also the EN 301-549. It's a European standard for digital accessibility, which measures the accessibility of websites, electronic documents, and non web software, such as native mobile apps. So now that we have a little bit of a background about accessibility and our WCAG guidelines, let's dive into some specific action steps to improve web accessibility on our sites. First, alt text. We want to add alternative text to all images, provide text alternatives for all non text content, such as images, audio, or videos so that it can be changed into other forms people need such as speech, braille, or text. We wanna make sure that there's an alt attribute for every image.

Cousett Hoover [00:09:38]:
We want to use text to describe the image, to write out any text present on the image, or leave it blank if it's purely eye candy. Provide a text transcript to any audio content that you may have on your site, and provide captions for all video content. 2nd, our headings. We wanna make sure that we're using headings correctly throughout our site. Headings are used to navigate through the site, identify key elements of a site, and skip over repetitive navigation. We want to make sure that we're not using headings just for the design or the font. And actually, use headings in a structural order using one heading 1 and then starting with a heading 2 and embedding heading threes through 6 as needed. So it separates long form content.

Cousett Hoover [00:10:31]:
You can separate long form content with headings as well. Our third tip is color contrast. We need to ensure that there's a sufficient contrast in our, site. That means that text on a page is sufficient for color blind or low vision users. The visual presentation of text and images of text should have a contrast ratio of at least 4.5 to 1. In large print and in images of large print, you could have a contrast ratio of 3 to 1. Decorative images and logo types are exempt from this requirement. So testing your color contrast and seeing if your brand has good contrast within a couple of your different colors on your site is really, really important.

Cousett Hoover [00:11:21]:
Doing using color beyond, or beyond color alone. So don't depend on color to convey meaning. I see this a lot in things are required. We have it marked in red. Instead, add like an asterisk and the red color and mark it as, required. I also see this in links where links do not have an underline and then it's maybe a different color. And if you're visual, you can see that different color. But if you're not, then without that underline, no one will know that it's, a link.

Cousett Hoover [00:11:58]:
So next up, we have meaningful links. So links should make sense outside of context. You want to avoid using click here or more info and links should refer to their destination. So in a content area where you might have links to multiple, articles or so forth, you want to make sure that it has kind of the title of the article, linked or something besides just a click here or more or things like that. Next up, let's talk about web assistive technologies and evaluating, accessibility. Web assistive technologies are products, equipment, and systems that enhance learning, working, and daily living for persons with disabilities. I will also let's take a look at how these, technologies work, and we'll also have a demo of how it works, in a few minutes. Web assistive technology.

Cousett Hoover [00:12:59]:
These can include alternative keyboards, alternative mice, headwands, mouth sticks, refreshable braille displays, screen magnifiers, screen readers, and voice recognition software. Some popular screen readers include jaws by Freedom Scientific and Apple voice over. It can be really helpful to understand the unique way that screen readers work. So screen readers announce and read everything, including page titles, acronyms, alt text, links, headings, and more. They have special modes to navigate more complex elements like tables and forms, and they depend on the keyboard to navigate around a website. Let's visit a demo site created by the Web Accessibility Initiative Education outreach working group. The demo will illustrate some of the aspects of web accessibility. It does not cover every type of accessibility barrier or accessibility requirement.

Computer [00:14:32]:
City lights. Your access to the city. Image. Sunny spells. Image. Explore side by topic. Quick menu. Explore side by topic.

Computer [00:15:03]:
Full story.

Cousett Hoover [00:15:05]:
Okay. Let's take a look at our demo site. So we have, an inaccessible before and then an accessible after. The w three c or the web accessibility initiative, did do a report. So we'll look at the report, and then I have, the web aim wave tool, report and what's this one? The silktide, one that I also liked. So here's our inaccessible. When we listen to it with voice over, we hear like the long description of this. That doesn't make any sense because that's not what we need as a user of this website.

Cousett Hoover [00:15:51]:
There's re there's mores here and there's a lot that we hear when we listen to the voice over. So this is the, silktide. I really like this one. I thought this was good. It analyzes the page, and it gives you different things are wrong. So image, and link alt text. So we have alt text that's missing. We have table headers are missing.

Cousett Hoover [00:16:17]:
We have links that are not descriptive. If we go into color contrast, this is the foreground and this is the background. So that doesn't pass. It shows for normal text, it does not pass. For large text, it might pass. But that's just normal text, so that doesn't pass. Then we have, we can go in and see the alt text that's missing. So I really like this Chrome extension.

Cousett Hoover [00:16:44]:
It seems really nice. This is

Computer [00:16:46]:
pretty nice.

Cousett Hoover [00:16:46]:
Oh, it has even like a little demo of a screen reader. That's kind of cool. You can go into impaired vision and see what things look like with different, issues. Some different, and color blindness. What things look like with color blindness and how that, responds. So a really, really nice extension I found. WebAIM has the wave toolbar. It's a super popular toolbar.

Cousett Hoover [00:17:16]:
A lot of people use it. I personally get overwhelmed by it, but, a lot of people like it. So you see the errors here are happening. So there's missing alt text. There's it's a table layout. Oops. What happened? I must have closed it. Oh, I guess I loaded it.

Cousett Hoover [00:17:40]:
Okay. Let's try one more time. Alright. So let's see. We have, so I think that's the alt text for that. So that's really kind of this long red dot with a white letter c. We heard that in the, in voice over. And now we have a lot of things that don't have alt text.

Cousett Hoover [00:18:02]:
So we can break down into the errors, missing alt text, link image, missing alternative text. There's a lot of things that we can do here as well. You can see kind of what the link, the keyboard tab will be when you go. So you're starting up here, 2, 3. That makes sense. And then 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18. So that looks good. So there's a lot that we can do here.

Cousett Hoover [00:18:30]:
There's no structure whatsoever. So there's no headings and stuff like that. Whereas in our accessible page, we, have headings. So let's take a look. This is the last tool that I have. It's called accessibilitychecker.org. It you put in the URL of the page and it gives you a report. So a little different.

Cousett Hoover [00:18:52]:
But it does go in and show you kind of different things that are critical issues, that are past audits, that are required manual audits. So a lot of things can't be done by automated tester. You need your eyes and ears to do it, and then maybe things that aren't applicable. So you can go in and then you can fix the 47 issues and so forth. And you can also, I think, change what law you're using, but that might be in the paid version. So there's a lot that you can do here. Last but not least, if you go to this page, which I really recommend you go and navigate around and, just explore this demo a little bit more. I wasn't able to in the presentation for very long, but we have, their report that they have.

Cousett Hoover [00:19:43]:
So the inaccessible report, and they break it down by all the WCAG guidelines. So here are the failures. We have, failures here on adaptable info and relationships. We have text presentation, without so, it's depending on color alone. We have, keyboard accessible. It's not keyboard accessible throughout. We can't get to specific things and functions, and then understandable and then robust. So it breaks down based on WCAG, all the different issues, and, and you can see that as well.

Cousett Hoover [00:20:25]:
So with our, good page or after page after we've made all of the changes and so forth, let's do this one and we can just go in and get the general analysis. And see one issue with semantic links, but that's it. That's all it came up with. So there's a lot, to be said about the changes that were made. We can also go into the report for the accessible and you can see kind of what they changed and what they fixed. And let's do one last. We can go to web aim and see kind of the visual that they did. So zero errors.

Cousett Hoover [00:21:06]:
There are some alerts. There's some features, but you can see sunny spells, is kind of what that is. City lights, your access to the city. It's doing the text instead of this long description of it. Because remember, all text, you want to just convey the information that's there. So if it's text, you want to make sure it's text. Then we have different things here. These are probably marked with, as just eye candy because there's not really anything extra that's happening from this, as well as these images most likely because there's just not anything that we can gain from that.

Cousett Hoover [00:21:45]:
It's just visual to help a visual person kind of see the different, stories and so forth. So with that, that's a little quick, quick, quick way to go kind of go through and look at our, sites and test it. There's a lot more that you can do. This could be a whole workshop in itself, but I hope this gets us started a little bit and you have a little bit more understanding on this. Alright. Let's talk about some action steps. So when looking at your website, let's run an alt text report and see if your images are missing any alt text. When writing content, use headings to organize your articles, pages, and more.

Cousett Hoover [00:22:33]:
Do not use them just for font size or for design. Test your site for color contrast, in your brand colors. Don't just use color for web elements like red for important or required. Avoid using links that do not make sense outside of context of the webs of the website. Let's talk some action steps. So run an alt text report and see if any of your images are missing alt text. When writing content, use headings to organize your articles, pages, and more. Do not just use them for your font size.

Cousett Hoover [00:23:11]:
Test your site for color contrast. Test your brand colors. You also want to not use color, for web elements, just color for web elements. So make sure that your, required and so forth are not just red, but there's additional text that helps the user. And you wanna avoid using links that do not make sense outside of the context of the page. Let's review a bit. So web accessibility is universal design and good business practice. The WCAG guidelines are international, but many countries have their own guidelines to follow.

Cousett Hoover [00:23:50]:
There are many things you can do to make your site more accessible today. Assistive technologies work in a unique way to help their users. Screen readers have special features to make navigating websites a little easier. And it's best not to depend on automated tools, but there are lots of tools that are manual checks or other tools that you can use to test your site. Some resources and some, things that I use when doing web accessibility include the equalize digital. They have a great WordPress plugin that helps out. Web aim has some great tutorials and information out there. The web accessibility initiative is a part of the w three c, which is, organizing unit for web technologies, and they have a lot of resources to help out.

Cousett Hoover [00:24:49]:
And WAVE is one of my favorite, web accessibility, tools. There's a Chrome plugin that you can use, that adds a toolbar to your site and you can test really, really easily. In addition to, you know, tools are specific to accessibility, you wanna use also just general tools that help with accessibility. So I really like the Kadence WP theme. If you're using WordPress, it's a very clean theme. Its start is very accessible. And so then as you build on top of it, as long as you keep things accessible, it will be good. Elementor Pro actually has a lot of features that help with accessibility.

Cousett Hoover [00:25:29]:
They have a huge kind of push to make things accessible, and so they have a lot of things that can help as well. And then since accessibility and SEO are kind of hand in hand and they help each other, having a really great host like WP Engine really helps things. Making sure that your site is fast, that it runs, that's secure and it runs really well will help things in the end. Thank you for attending my session. I would love to get to know you better. Please drop in the summit chat box and let's continue more, connect more, and continue the conversation. I'll also have a couple of questions that you might be able to answer or that we can discuss in the chat box. Last but not least, I have a couple of gifts for you.

Cousett Hoover [00:26:15]:
I have the web accessibility checklist. It's gonna be a checklist that kind of gives you step by step a couple things to test, some of the things that we've talked about, and a few more, things that you can take a look at. I also have a program called Tech Angel. So I've been called more than once the Tech Angel. And in my program, I help you at different levels, with questions and your tech and I can completely do things for you or I can answer questions. And there's a lot of different ways that we can connect and that we can work together. And thank you. I hope we can get in touch, and let's continue the conversation in the summit group.

**Transcript:**
[00:00:19.290] - Erin Perkins, mabelyq.com
Oh, I'm sorry, I was muted. You're saying you need audio. Is that what I'm hearing. Well, what do you think it's like being deaf. By the way I am totally judging you right now. Deaf people requesting caption is equivalent to hearing people requesting audio. ""Imagine being denied to access to audio every time, everywhere and every day"", L. Friedemann.

[00:00:54.300] - Erin
So, here's what I like for you to do before we get started. I want everyone to turn on the subtitle on the ad, and I want you to really get an idea of what it's like to follow along with caption. Typically when it's live, a live event and you have live captioning, you are actually going to notice the delays. You're going to notice the error. Welcome to my life.

[00:01:24.970] - Erin
All right. Let's get started here. There are seven point seven billion people in the world. Over a billion of those people, which is about 15 percent of the world's population, have some form of disability. Now in the U.S. alone there is actually, one in four adults have a disability. So, when I talk about disability? I'm not just talking about the physical disability. I'm also talking about vision, hearing, learning, chronic illness and also temporary disability as well. Within the global number, a global market. I'm talking bigger number. We're talking trillions of dollars. People with disabilities have a spending power of more than six trillion dollars. That's trillion with the letters T. This should tell you, people with disabilities have money to spend. We have money to invest. So let's really get into it. So I'm going to go on the assumption that most of us are small business owners, that of other small business owner. So statistics actually show that there are more people with disabilities who start their own business over people without disability. Though, when you look at these numbers, the Small Business Association reported that 12.2 % of the general population show self employment vs. 14.3% of the people with disability who have started their own businesses. The reason why I bring that up again, most of us as small business owners, so you typically tend to accommodate other small business owners? There are more people than you realize that that do have disability in any form or way.

[00:03:28.660] - Erin
So, what happens when your online business isn't accessible to the disabled community? So, If you're actually here live with me, I want you to pop in the chat what you think happens when your business isn't acceptable to the disabled community. And I'll take my comments in there. So, when your business is not acceptable, to put it quite simply, you will lose money. Eighty-six percent of the people encounter difficulty on a website even when they use assistive software. Assistive software could be anywhere from a screen reader, like using a special designed keyboard that helped them tap through things faster, anything that helps with magnification. If they have difficulty, that's 86% of those people. Seventy percent of those people leave the website and that actually leaves revenue on the table.

[00:04:48.430] - Erin
That said that is 14.4 billion dollars per year out the window. However, they said, 82% of those people will return to a company and spend more money with a company that provides an acceptable online experience. So, I know when I have a good experience with a company, I usually go back and buy from them again. We're all in the business of serving others so you want to create a good experience for everybody.

[00:05:27.160] - Erin
I'm going to tell you this, you don't want to be like Dominos. You could end up in court. The fact is Dominoes have been in court because of the fact that their app was not designed to be user friendly for people with disabilities. Their lawsuit was taken all the way up to the Supreme Court and Dominos lost.

[00:05:59.830] - Erin
In 2017- in all of 2017, 814 website accessibility lawsuit were filed in federal court. Now, you move on to 2018, in the first six months there were 1053 website accessibility lawsuits that were filed in court. That is almost double the amount of 2017 lawsuit. I don't want to scare you, but it really could happen to you. Here's the thing, these lawsuits could cost you between 15,000 - 100,000. There's are  a wide range of what would happen.

[00:06:44.180] - Erin
I'm doing all this research on accessibility. I've had several conversation with website accessibility experts. And they've had a client that decided not to work with them in the first place because they didn't want to spend the money on monthly maintenance. These client have ended up coming back to them several months later because they've had lawsuits filed against them because the website was not up to Web Content Accessibility Guideline standards.

[00:07:15.440] - Erin
So, when the lawsuits were filed against them, the client then came back to the website accessibility company and asked them to resolve the issue, so that they're in compliance with the law. The price of monthly maintenance, I've read right from the two clients- two company that I collaborate with, are like $50-$500 a month vs. 15,000- 100,000 in a lawsuit. So, you do the math there.

[00:07:56.990] - Erin
I'm a deaf woman. I'm an online business manager. I'm a graphic designer. And I'm a disability advocate. I'm Erin Perkins. I the CEO of Maberly Q. I founded Maberly Q in 2018 to work with rebel women, entrepreneurs who are ready to take their business from startup to scale up. In collaboration with that, I'm also a disability advocate and educator on why accessibility is important and showing business how to be more inclusive. For the last two years, I have been teaching my clients the simple but incredibly important strategies in order to make their businesses accessible and successful. Something I call successible.

[00:08:41.750] - Erin
Now, I want to explain that I do find myself a different case. Yes, I am deaf. Yes, I do speak thanks to years and years and years of speech therapy. Yes, I can hear only with the help of my cochlear implant, my hearing aid and using an interpreter. I also rely on technology such as the audio AI app. 

[00:09:10.310] - Erin
Now I want to clarify not all deaf people are like me. There are several friends of mine that I have that can't do what I do, which is I, you know, be on webinars and summits like this and still interact fairly well.

[00:09:27.800] - Erin
Now, there are other friends that can have full on phone conversations with a complete stranger, their family members, whoever. I can't do that. I have to have an interpreter for when I'm on these calls, so, there is a wide range of what a deaf person is. But we are deaf. We all have different needs.

[00:09:58.070] - Erin
Why I am so excited to be speaking at the Breakthrough Bloggers Summit? So, I am a serious, serious blog reader. I have been making this part of my morning routine for, on regular for 10+ years- since the dawn of time. So, I know that probably just aged me here. So, blogging has really enabled me to connect with so many people that I otherwise would never meet. This is like really part of my morning routine. Other people journal, I read blogs, like a religion and funny thing is I probably follow 50-70 blogs. I know it's kind of ridiculous, but it really is my thing. My personal favorites tend to be DIY, home renovation and fitness. Yet, I'm not a blogger.

[00:10:55.760] - Erin
So I know that the biggest challenge with blogging is you're all trying to do the next big thing: social media, adding videos, and doing podcasts. And sometimes I've actually seen some of my favorite bloggers shift from just writing content and just doing videos and they just do Instagram stories.

[00:11:22.610] - Erin
Why should you make your blog accessible and inclusive? I'll show you what you can do, but I want to talk about why. Because when you're not, you lose followers and fans, dozens. When you're not accessible, you're kind of a jerk. I'm just putting that out there. I kind of think you're a jerk. We all know in today's time the number of followers does mean something.

[00:11:50.030] - Erin
So, I want to share a story with you about a blogger that I've been following for many, many years. And many of my friends did too. Huge fan of them, were very active and commenting, posting on their blog. At one point they decided to stop blogging and move on to podcasting. Totally fine, I was invested. They've been doing it for so many years, but when they started doing podcasts, they didn't transcribe it. And they'd only do show notes, which we all know doesn't really include anything from the podcast. This is really frustrating for us because we would reach out like a bunch of me and my friend actually follow them. We reached out and asked like, ""Hey, can you transcribe."" And we felt like we missed out because they weren't blogging on a regular basis. Their response to us was, ""It's really expensive to transcribe. Who wants to read one hour of talking on a Podcast?"" We do. Besides we can read fast. It is a lot quicker than spending an hour listening to the podcast. Finally, I respect that there is a lot of work for editing it.

[00:13:06.440] - Erin
Honestly, I felt like the blogger was taking the easy way out. The reality is we all knew that the blog is their source of revenue and they're able to live off of it comfortably with the blog income alone. It literally showed me how not valued we were. The ironic thing is this year they spent a lot of time invested on being inclusive and stuff. The thing is people with disabilities are people too.

[00:13:39.410] - Erin
The reason why I share this story with you, because I know you're creating content for your audience, but you really have no idea who is following you out there. I have pretty much stopped actively commenting and I take what they promote with a grain of salt because I really don't feel like I'm a valued member of their audience.

[00:14:01.460] - Erin
Now, on the flip side, there was another blogger that I also followed. She started doing a lot more Instagram stories but she wasn't captioning them. So, I would like send them a DM and I'm like, ""Can you make sure you caption your video in someway so I can still be involved?"" Her response was, ""I'm so sorry. I didn't even think about that."" And she remedied that situation like immediately and she does it like on point all the time now.

[00:14:35.600] - Erin
So, here's the thing, when it comes to blog accessibility or business as a whole, why do you need to do this? Because honestly, it's the right thing to do. You want to make and create a good user experience for everybody. You treat all users equally. That includes people with disabilities such as blind people, physical limitation, deaf people, people with learning disabilities, but whatever it is. Also when you're accessible, you actually will increase your reach and exposure.

[00:15:08.780] - Erin
Now, when you're also accessible, it actually makes your content even more searchable. There's really great SEO.

[00:15:17.930] - Erin
Now and honestly, once this starts becoming your income, your monetary income, you have a legal responsibility to do this. I really should not even have to explain this, but websites are actually getting sued more than ever before. So make sure you do the right thing.

[00:15:44.900] - Erin
Common misconceptions about being accessible. Many people think when you're being accessible you are going super basic. That's actually quite the opposite. When you realize that this is an outdated notion that accessibility means stripping away features, starting over and dealing with the impossible. But the fact is being accessible is actually a source of innovation and growth, it can be a catalyst for creativity and a boost to the bottom line. And when we create an opportunity for more people to contribute to society in meaningful ways, little by little everyone can make progress.

[00:16:42.160] - Erin
What does being accessible look like? There's actually 8 places accessibility matters. When I first started doing research on accessibility, the thing that kept showing up was your website. But the more of I got to thinking about this, I was like, the website is probably not anyone's first touch points that a potential customer has to do.

[00:17:09.860] - Erin
You may actually connect with your potential reader via social media. And by that I mean Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, Tik Tok, maybe your email list, somehow they got on your email list. Or they saw your design somewhere else and they followed you on social media. Or somebody was like promoting your course about design or whatever. Or like they found your recipe on Pinterest. Or they connected with you virtually. Or maybe they met in person or about physical assets like, you know, the building where you have the handicap door, like every time you communicate on any one of these platforms, social media, email, your design, your website, your online course, you actually could lose the reader/customer because they can't access your content.

[00:18:16.310] - Erin
So, I'm doing a top three things tailor made just for bloggers, because you're a blogger. You're my favorite kind of people. So, it's easy. I promise you. So, in case you haven't finished- figured it out yet. I'm a huge fan of Schitt's Creek. Late commer, nonetheless. I'm a fan. So, I think we all know that premise of Schitt's Creek is really about, it doesn't really matter who you are identity. Like it doesn't matter what race you are, doesn't matter what gender you are, doesn't matter what sexuality you are. They even make it a thing. It was literally like ""Listen, this is what's happening. This relationship is what happened."" The same thing actually applies to people with disability, whether someone was born with a disability or came later in life, it's already hard enough for us. And only and enough for one. We're asking just for a little bit of help to help level the playing field because honestly, the world was design for a hetero normative white male. If you're a white male out there, I apologize, but I'm not stereotyping, but it is what the world was designed.

[00:19:42.550] - Erin
So we're going to start with your website because we all know, you start with your website. So when we talk about your website, this is usually for blind and visually impaired people. You might think, ""Why would a blind person be on my website?"" Blind people actually use technology a lot more than the rest of us because this is their connection to the world. So, when they navigate websites and blogs, they usually use shortcut keys. When you use your header, when you're designing your website, you want to make sure you include the header one, head two, header three, because this enables the blind people, visually impaired people, to navigate around your blog efficiently and easily and be able to skip post titles and other aspects, and adding the headers actually help with readability.

[00:20:45.340] - Erin
So, I'm going to talk about link text. When you're linking to something outside, another page or whatever, you want to make sure that it's something relevant and meaningful. A lot of times people, in fact, have always said, ""Click Here"", ""Read This"". Okay, I'm reading this.  That doesn't tell me anything. Like no. You want to make sure that you make it relevant. Like ""Read more here"" and that'll take them somewhere else. Or you're actually linking to a product or whatever. Don't be like click here, click here.

[00:21:30.640] 
I know a lot of you include images in your website, in your blog. You want to make sure you include alt-text. The reason for alt-text is, yes, it improves SEO but a blind and visually impaired person they're not really seeing the picture or they don't have a clear idea of what the picture is, having the alt-text in there gives  them a little bit of a leg up in regards to, ""Oh that's what the image is about."" You know.

[00:22:06.130] - Erin
Now, this might not be a favorite for people without disability for able bodied people, but the fact is I also learned this- don't force links to open in new window or tab. Now we'll let you know that Squarespace does allow you to turn this on and off.

[00:22:24.760] - Erin
So, the reason why you need to code it so that it just opens, and not in a new window or tab is because when you open it in a new window or tab, it actually becomes very disorienting for a visually impaired user. And even though they might use a screen reader, only the most recent screen reader gives blind users any indication that a new window had been opened. Popping open a new window also resets the back button effectively breaking that link. So, you want to avoid doing that.

[00:23:08.620] - Erin
So, when you have the next thing, your blog roll should be on the right hand side. Blind users will actually find top and left hand navigation bar annoying because the screen reader starts at the top of the page and reads from left to right. So, it is very time consuming to listen to the same list of links every time you visit a page. You can get people right to your latest post by putting your navigational link on your right hand side.

[00:23:40.640] - Erin
Finally, I know you like using video, you like using audio that starts automatically. It is very hard for people with visual impairment to navigate your blog. If you use video and audio that start automatically, then people who have to use screen reader have to listen to that all the way through, which is very frustrating, aggravating. It's just causes problem for them. It actually also causes problems for people with other disabilities as well. If you want to use video or audio on your blog, make sure you add an option for people to click start if they want to, rather than it starting automatically.

[00:24:29.050] - Erin
So that's your website! That is tip number one.

[00:24:33.460] - Erin
Social media- you want to be accessible on social media. So, you want to use Camel Case or Inital Capitalization for your hashtag. I know Instagram doesn't make this easy when you initial cap because when you initial cap, it makes it easy for the screen reader to actually read what the words are. Otherwise, it will not be able to read the words out loud as it would be incoherent. It also actually help people with learning disabilities to be able to read it easier. So, what I actually do is I have a set list of hashtags that I store in my app and I already made them all Camel Case, so they automatically go in the way I want it to.

[00:25:25.990] - Erin
Next thing, you want to be descriptive in your link. So when you're asking for someone to click here, don't just say, ""Click here"". Make sure you explain where they're going, like, you know, ""You want to read more, swipe up for details on the product."" And stuff like that. If you have over 10,000 followers, like you can be like, make sure your swipe up is clear on where the swipe up is going. If you don't have 10,000 followers, you will only want to say the link is in my biro, and then when you leave them, make sure you left a link in your link to your website, whatever it is, is clear as to what each link is. It is not just images. It has the actual words that is readable, not just a picture that doesn't really tell people anything. You want to... Which brings me to alt-text. You want to make sure you include alt-text or even better image description. So, I really encourage you to include image description in the caption or in the first comment. Those are like 3 things that you can do to improve your social media.

[00:26:43.450] - Erin
Finally, audio and video. So, I know as a blogger you probably have a lot of audio and video. Number one, caption your video. Do not rely on auto captions that Facebook and InstagramTV has set up. It is not good. It is not accurate. Like you want to control your narrative. You want to make sure that the caption, is accurate as they can be. Next, you want to make sure you have transcripts available. If you're doing a podcast or you're doing a video and you don't have time to do that, transcribe your video and make sure that transcript is available.

[00:27:26.890] - Erin
Finally be open to adding new practices  to your process.

[00:27:36.400] - Erin
There's a lot of information that I've shared on how you can ensure that you're blogging is accessible to everybody. But I really don't want you to get super overwhelmed because one day, what I want you to do right now is shoot one thing, like, whether it's for your website or whether it's for your social media or for your video and audio, take one thing and take action on it. I want you to take action on it and do it well. And once you integrate that into your process, then you'll be able to add on the next thing.

[00:28:17.720] - Erin
It's like I say, it is a marathon, not a sprint.

[00:28:24.670] - Erin
Finally, we have key takeaways. So, as you've gone through the presentation, I hope you enjoyed it. I've included a workbook for you to, like, download for free to and you can get on my email list. I want you to think about that. Why is it important for you to make your content inclusive and accessible?

[00:28:50.140] - Erin
Now the next question I bring up is, why this is everyone's responsibility not just one person? Say you're part of a group of bloggers and you noticed that somebody is not captioning their video. Like you need to make sure that you call them out on it. Say, ""Hey, I noticed you just posted this new video, but it's not a captioned. Like you might want to make sure you do that.""

[00:29:17.860] - Erin
Now, I know some bloggers have teams, team member. How will you inspire everybody on your team to want to ensure that your- all your content is created is inclusive and accessible? Maybe you work for several different bloggers or you are like the manager for the blogger that you will make sure, ""Hey, can we think about this a little bit?""

[00:29:44.760] - Erin
Now I want you to write down, what is the one commitment that you're going to make to make your content more accessible?

[00:29:53.830] - Erin
Finally and then an opportunity for you to share what you've learned with others.

[00:30:02.260] - Erin
The main thing, everyone should feel inclusive, valued, seen and heard. So, I always want to tell people that you want to remember: It's progress, not perfection. You're not going to get it right the first time. You're also not going to get it all done at once. You're going to start making progress. So, don't forget to download the free workbook and you get on my email to get free resource guides to help make sure you get a head start on making sure your blog is accessible.

[00:30:37.220] - Erin
Well, you know, reach out to me on any of the platforms. I'm always happy to connect with new people. And I really hope that you've enjoyed this and you are on your way to making your content more accessible or as I say Successible.

**Transcript:**
[00:00:14.810] - Speaker 1
Could you last 24 hours without any access to sound? No sound on your phone? Not being able to have a simple conversation with your neighbor outside. Complete silence.

[00:00:31.530] - Speaker 1
Could you do it for 48 hours? 72 hours? How many of you are starting to get uncomfortable? You know, we live in a world that's incredibly noisy and you have no access to sound. This is normal for 350,000,000 people in the world if they have a disabling hearing loss.

[00:00:58.030] 
Did you know that people with disability are the largest minority group in the United States over any other minority group? This group crosses boundaries such as age, ethnicity, gender, race, sexual orientation and socioeconomic status.

[00:01:19.910] - Speaker 1
Small businesses, big business, every company in between. Even you as a Blogger, you are a business. We have to start prioritizing flexibility from day one. If it's too late to start from day one, start right now.

[00:01:36.140] - Speaker 1
I'm going to talk about three different ways of why it's important to be accessible for people with disabilities. First of all, it's really important that we all unlearn the assumptions that disabled people to be responsible for their own acceptability needs and start accepting responsibility. We'll also going over some actionable items that you can do right now. And finally, we're going to tell you why accessibility is better for everyone, not just for people with disability.

[00:02:14.730] - Speaker 1
I'm a DeafBlind woman who has had to face obsiticals in my entire life. With the lack of adaptability everywhere I go, including my job of eleven years. I even had a boss that told me she almost didn't hire me. During my time there, I often will be questioned whether or not I really need an interpreter during meeting or why I couldn't just answer the phone. I was also constantly told that I wasn't good enough to be a manager.

[00:02:43.180] - Speaker 1
Despite all of this, I still wanted the opportunity to move up within the company. I just didn't know how or didn't I really have the support.

[00:02:55.390] - Speaker 1
During my time at the company, the American Disabilities Act always weighed on my mind. This is something that's supposed to protect me and everybody else that has a disability. It's literally all people rights. I'd like to share that this act is only 31 years old and is younger than me. The unfortunate thing is despite having the American Disabilities Act, so many companies fail miserably in creating access for people with disabilities.

[00:03:28.990] 
Many businesses of all sizes tend to have chips, responsibility, spectates and slapped onto people with disability and assume that they should know everything about what is provided to them and what laws are. Which result in frustration and doubt. The reality is companies needs to accept responsibility on providing support. When we ask for support. Do not question what we need. I don't like being questioned about my ability even though I can speak and I can hear with the help of tool.

[00:04:05.300] - Speaker 1
This line of questioning often leads me to doubt my own ability within my disability. I know my own limits. People with disability do not need someone else questioning our own abilities. Well, we don't expect you to know everything there is, but we also don't know everything there is, especially when it comes to your business. We need this to be a collaboration rather than it being me versus you.

[00:04:34.810] - Speaker 1
How do I like, put this in perspective? Say, you've created a video for your blog, and someone reaches out to you and they've asked you, ""Can you caption the video? I don't know what you're saying?"" When someone tells me, ""Oh, I don't have time for that."" This means this comes back to us. The story we created our own head is, you don't care about me as a reader.

[00:05:04.520] - Speaker 1
So instead of doing that, you can say, ""You know what? Let me look into it and let me figure it out."" Or if you really don't know how to caption a video, you'll be like, ""Okay, so here's my scenario. I don't know how to capture video, but I also don't want to put all the responsibility on you. How can we work together to ensure that you get what you need, because I do want to keep you as a reader?

[00:05:36.070] 
And to me, that's how you truly collaborate with somebody. Because in the past, there's been a blogger where they shifted onto podcast, and we would ask them to transcribe. And their answer to me was it cost too much money. That to me made me feel like, ""Oh, I'm not valued,"" and that didn't feel good.

[00:06:07.360] - Speaker 1
So think about, when you answer somebody, as they reach out to you to ask you to do something, how you might make them feel as a reader.

[00:06:22.860] 
It good to remember that there is no one size system. You might have created something that's supposed to be accessible to most, but unfortunately, sometimes there might be one person that is just not accessible for. So don't be standoffish and be like, ""Oh, I've already created something,"" and it doesn't work for that question. Maybe that's just something you need to have a conversation about.

[00:06:51.450] - Speaker 1
Truth be told, I stayed at my company way longer than I should have because I had this internal fear that I'd never get hired anywhere else because of my disability. After eleven years of dedication, I was laid off. Once I got over the shock of being laid off, I knew I had two choices: apply to work at another company and repeat the same process all over again, starting my own business. Guess which one I chose? I mean, it's obvious! I'm here now. The harder one. I started my own business, so I started my business.

[00:07:30.030] - Speaker 1
We all know it's not that easy. And the first obstical I came across was this course that I purchased online. None of the videos will captioned. I wasn't even make any money at this point. I was bootstrapping it, and I invested a good portion of my investment into this course.

[00:07:49.920] - Speaker 1
So I struggled through the course and I vowed I would never buy another course again unless I knew all the videos were captioned. So this is my perspective. Big company such as the company I worked at didn't even do a great job of it. Of giving me access so why would I ever expect a small business to provide me with access.

[00:08:18.970] 
You know, I knew the American Disability Act existed for such reasons, however, the American Disability Act did not typically apply to small businesses. Here's how it stated, if providing and creating access create undue hardship for the business, such that it is difficult to provide for or is true cost to then the business is not required to adapt. So this began my journey to educate small business owners like all of you about accessability. But when I first started, I really didn't know what I needed from these small businesses that I needed you to do in order to ensure I equal access.

[00:09:05.410] - Speaker 1
But I also knew that your budget was significantly smaller.

[00:09:10.350] - Speaker 1
So I was like, how am I going to figure this out? But my thing was I wanted everybody to know that there are 20 million people with disabilities. These people represent $490 billion in disposable income. Globally, these figures jump up to 1 billion people with disabilities with $8 trillion in disposable income. Take a moment to soak those numbers in.

[00:09:51.190] 
Understanding that people with disability have the third largest economic power over, in the world, they pushed us about Japan, Germany, United Kingdom. This means we have a lot of spending power and we have money to spend.

[00:10:11.090] - Speaker 1
So the thing is, here's how we need to think about this. We have small businesses, big corporations. The company that prioritize accessablity will put themselves steps ahead of other companies that do not prioritize accessablity. When these company do this, they're going to attract people with disabilities as consumers and their peers around them. It's also lead to more innovation because if you prioritize it from the beginning, you have been a little bit more innovative.

[00:10:52.830] - Speaker 1
You're more steps ahead and then in the result, because accessablity was built in from the beginning, you have less maintenance to deal with. You're not having to go all the way back to fix anything.

[00:11:05.100] - Speaker 1
Ola Ojewumi, Founder and Director of Project Ascend said, ""Being disabled is the one group that you don't have to be born into. You can become disabled at any time. So my fight for equality and disability justice should be your fight because you may very well become a person with disability one day.""

[00:11:35.050] - Speaker 1
The idea is we need to come to understanding that accessablity benifits more people than it does not.

[00:11:45.830] - Speaker 1
The reality is the world was designed and is still designed for heteronormative white male. Did you realize that people with disabilities are likely to be the original hackers? We have to hack our very daily lives as very little is designed for us. I want to share this example with you.

[00:12:13.050] - Speaker 1
The deaf community. This is the community that I've been part of my entire life. Within our community we've been communicating via texting since the early 2000s, before anybody else was. Now it's completely normal to be testing with one another. There might be some people who still pick up the phone, but you know.

[00:12:42.430] 
I also want to share the story with you. I've been part of the blogging world since the very early 2000s. This is a world to me that had no barrier. Everything was written, everything was easy. I didn't have to try so hard to understand people as if I met them in person. I stuck with blogging, even as platforms shifted.

[00:13:05.150] 
Facebook, YouTube, Instagram, Twitter, SnapChat, Tiptok, Podcast, Clubhouse. All these things started to come through and different things you can do with them. But the thing is, the last couple of years have started leaving me with the feeling of being left behind, again.You know, we have the newest and greatest thing. Accessibility priorities are being shuffled down to the bottom of the list, once again. Audio focus platform become all the rage again. I mean, there was radio, talk radio back in the day.

[00:13:48.650] 
So I'm going to go over with you how you can be acceptable on social media because I think this is one of the step in terms that will allow you to be more accessablity across your entire platform. Social media flexibility is one of the easiest things you can do and it can file into everything now.

[00:14:14.490] - Speaker 1
Number one, this is my number one rule: Caption all audio and video based content. Video content can be incredibly engaging, but without transription captions, it's not acceptable. It's that simple. All material needs to be captioned, whether it's video or audio based.

[00:14:38.430] - Speaker 1
Even if the person is signing. Me when I signed, I would make sure I have captured.

[00:14:47.290] - Speaker 1
Now, I also want you to choose your platform thoughtfully. Not all social media platform include accessibility features. For example, if you use platforms that are audio or video based, make sure you caption all your content. One of the examples, that I like to use is Clubhouse. It is audio based. However, they don't necessarily allow for transcribing in real time.

[00:15:14.530] 
Now, we're also going to talk about podcast. I know a lot of people have decided to do blogging/podcast. They all layer. I get it. Podcast is a great marketing tool and it's a converstaion piece.But be sure to provide a transcript or a caption video version of the audio content.

[00:15:40.370] - Speaker 1
Next, add an alt text for image description. So alt text is great for website and image description is great for social media. The reason why I say this outline in this way is because social media are starting to provide a space for alt text but sometimes it is easier to do image description as you can include that in your caption or first comment and schedule ahead of time. Alt text is not part of any scheduling.

[00:16:17.810] 
So alt text often is read only by the screen reader.It is invisible to any other person and you tend to add it to images on the website and social media pages. It describes the photo. There is a character limit and it is brief. Image description can be read by anyone. You can add it to your social media caption, your comment, or add the caption to a photo on the web page.It describes the photo, but it is usually a lot longer than alt text. There is no character limit.

[00:16:57.710] - Speaker 1
So if you want to know how to go add alt text on Instagram, what I suggest is you cannot do this on your computer. You have to do it on your phone. So when you go into the app, you'll go to your most recent photo and then you click on that photo and you're going to click on three dots in the upper right hand corner above the image that you want to edit. And then a window will pop up and it will give you a list of options. You want to select edit. And then the next thing that comes up is your picture with your caption and everything. You don't have to go all the way up to your picture. And in very faint white text, depending on how light or dark your images you'll see in the lower right hand corner of the image, you'll see text that says Edit alt test. You will want to click on that. Then a new window opens up that says, that is alt text and you can type in your alt text. And click done, that's it.

[00:18:05.590] - Speaker 1
So how do you write alt text? Number one, you'll want to keep it under 125 characters. This is shorter than a tweet. It's really important for you to describe the important aspect of your image. If it's purely decorative image, it doesn't need alt text.If it's a photo of a pie chart, say it's a pie chart. No keyword stuff. You're also not going to write the word ""photo of"". We already know it's a photo.

[00:18:38.870] 
Next, you're also going to write image description. Basically, the idea is object, action, content. Object is the main focus of your image. Action describe what is happening, what the object is doing, and context described the surrounding environment.

[00:19:04.290] - Speaker 1
To also define it more objective, concise, descriptive. So people using the description can form their own opinion. You also want to keep it concise enough to allow them to absorb all the concepts. But yet you still want it to be descriptive enough to explain all the essential aspects of the image.

[00:19:29.410] - Speaker 1
Finally, there are so many details to keep in mind. You do want to describe race and gender if it's relevant to the image. If you know what their identity is and how you describe it is consistent with other. If you are unsure, then describe them as people or person.

[00:19:52.150] 
Each of these are super simple actions you can take do to take that next step of being accessible for everything.

[00:20:05.810] - Speaker 1
As Nikki Eslami, founder of Wild Elements said, ""Building a culture of transparency where people understand that while we can always improve and involve, we are rooted in being kind to one another.""

[00:20:26.310] - Speaker 1
But I want to encourage you to get out of your own way and stop creating based on the assumption that only one way to do things. There are so many things out there that marketed as the only way. And this is the best way to do things. We all know you are bloggers. It is so far from the truth.

[00:20:45.870] - Speaker 1
There is not one way to blog. There's all kinds of ways! So with accessablity get out of your own way. We also want to shift our focus of accessablity to be more of the inclusive design. It considers the full range of human diversity with respect to ability, language, culture, gender, age, and other forms of human defense. We can and we should do better.

[00:21:21.780] 
Here's something that we can improve going forward and that is that working with people with disability, the collaborative effort. Do not put all the responsibility on them. So if you see someone like a fellow blogger, they've like done a video on social media that's not captioned. Give them a nudge and be like, ""Hey, make sure you caption yourvideo.' And then finally stop shuffling acceptable priority down to the bottom of your to do list. Start prioritizing it.

[00:21:58.520] - Speaker 1
Take a look at where you need to improve accessibility within your own company. Start with your own people. Start with your own consumers. Understand and know that being acceptable benefits more people than it does not. Start to shift your focus to include the full range of human diversity.

[00:22:24.290] - Speaker 1
To be honest, we're not expecting things to be absolutely perfect, but people with disabilities, such as myself, we do want to have the same access as you, an able bodied person. And the way we can get there is with a little help from you for making in this shift to be a more accessible world for both you and me. Thank you.

**Transcript:**
Erin Perkins [00:00:12]:
Hello. Welcome to the Art of Designing Accessible email. I am Erin Perkins, and I am deaf blind. I can hear with the help with my hearing aid and cochlear implant. I have no peripheral vision, so I can still see the center, but I can't see next to me, below me, or above me. I am a disability advocate, and you can call me an educator, a coach, a strategist, whatever. My mission is to teach you how to take accessible practice to to create an inclusive customer journey for everybody. I am also a design architect.

Erin Perkins [00:00:59]:
I love design. I think it's one of my favorite thing. If I wasn't doing this, I would probably be an interior designer or architect. So I wanted to quickly go over my little framework to help you understand how we have landed on the topic of email. So when I have created the word successable, which is just just an accessible that creates successible it is where accessibility and your business meet to create a successful future. And when I talk about the word success, I pull it out so that you can break it down into different aspects of your business. So you have all your aspects of business. You can utilize accessible events to connect with your audience and promote your brand.

Erin Perkins [00:01:53]:
You can create engaging and accessible podcast content that resonates with your community. You can communicate with your followers on social media with accessible content, enhance your brand design through the length of accessibility and inclusion, simplify your online presence by optimizing your website for inclusion and accessibility. And finally, we want to strengthen your communication to your audience via accessible email marketing. So these are all the different parts that I can teach and show you how to build accessibility into your business. Today, we are going to be talking about email. So I want you to think about what you are doing right now to support email accessibility. There have been people that said they use link and button to make it easy to see. They keep the paragraph short and simple.

Erin Perkins [00:02:55]:
They break up the content with heading and subheading. They choose a font that is easy to read. They leave plenty of white all of these are fantastic thing to consider. But I'd like to ask you, are you using emoji? Are you using GIF? Are you using video? Are you doing layout? All of these thing can actually create some sort of a accessibility barrier. So we are going to focus on 3 thing that you can do to ensure that you are accessible. The goal is to get to know your people. That's the first thing you wanna do. You wanna engage your list.

Erin Perkins [00:03:44]:
Use survey for feedback. Monitor which topic resonate, and listen to your people. By doing this, it's gonna help you naturally segment your list, which means you are segmenting your list based on specific behavior. So the update number 1 is we're going to segment our list. The reason why we want to do this is because you want to make sure your audience is satisfied because the people that might prefer plain text or the others that actually enjoy receiving email with some gifs and do it. So when you segment your list, it's gonna keep your audience happy and engaged. So what does being accessible, segmenting your list have to do with being accessible? A lot, really. Segmenting your list doing ensures you can create an accessible experience for everyone regardless of how they engage with your content.

Erin Perkins [00:04:53]:
Segment your list allows you to ensure that you are accommodating different reader preferences. If you like to design your email strictly using layout and use a lot of GIF and emojis, you might wanna consider that you're also using this text only email aspect to ensure that it's accessible. So one of the thing that you can do, as I mentioned in segmenting your list, is through link action. What you're gonna be doing in using the link action allows you to automate your action when the subscriber click on a specific link within the email. Ask your reader about their preferences and interests. Use the surveys and feedback form to gather this data. When you naturally segment them, that means you're gonna segment them based on specific behavior. So, say, one question I encourage you to ask, like, when they first join a list, you want text only, or do you want email with images? Give the reader a call to action to decide which statement they want to join.

Erin Perkins [00:06:20]:
Update number 2. We're gonna be talking about enhanced your link. There are several different ways you can do this, but the main reason why we do this is because we want to make sure that it is accessible. It's really important to design your call to action clearly because screen reader will often announce Links and buttons. If there is no text, they will say link or button. And the reason for that is the link needs to give the user an idea of what happened if the link is clicked on or activated. Don't worry. I have a couple of examples here.

Erin Perkins [00:07:05]:
So I have a screenshot of one of my email. So first of all, I wanna remind you, a call to action text should be meaningful and descriptive, and it tells the user what will happen after they click something. So for example in this, I have a line that said, if you can't make it but have a question or 2, you can fill out this form. And only the word form is highlighted in bold, different color, and underline, and I'll address it on the call. Form do not tell the user what is gonna happen. Especially if you are a screen reader user, you're gonna hear the word form link. That's not gonna give the reader context, what and what is gonna happen if they click on word form. And then I also have a button that said, a purple button that said join me, but it literally just says join me.

Erin Perkins [00:08:07]:
How is a reader or listener supposed to understand what join me means? So, another example that you can take note that makes it better. When it come to so with this one, I have said use this anonymous form to submit your question. It has bolded, change the color, and underlined anonymous form to submit your question. The reason being is if somebody, a screen reader were to say this out loud, it would tell them and not link to anonymous form to submit your question. They know, oh, this is gonna take me to a form so that I can submit my question. And then there's another one that said, add the date to your calendar. So when I click on it, they know they click on it. It could've take them to a calendar that you can add to your own calendar.

Erin Perkins [00:09:10]:
Then the button that clicked to join the successible monthly call. Oh, if I click this button, it mean I'm gonna join the call that's gonna happen. So it's really important to understand, Screen readers will announce links and buttons, but without any kind of context or alt text, the user can't discern where they will lead. They're less likely to engage with your email. So I want you to imagine if you are on a website or even your email, you encounter a link that says ""link"". Would you click on it? Probably not. It's like you enter an elevator, and all the buttons are plain blank. How do you know where you wanna go? This is why we need to prioritize making sure that we are giving clear and navigable pathway that guide users to their intended destination.

Erin Perkins [00:10:18]:
So the other thing I wanna emphasize, and and it's really important to have at least 2 more differentiator beside color when it come to highlighting your link. If you're using a button, that already give that differentiator. But if you're adding link to your body copy, you like, your text is blue. Your main body text is blue, but your link should be a different color. But I will show you the next thing. You wanna make sure you add I like to add bold and underline. The underline, I think, is really important to the highlight. This is a link.

Erin Perkins [00:11:04]:
I also wanna encourage you to go easy on hyperlink. Too many links can confuse your reader and hinder screen reader. When you limit the hyperlink to improve accessibility, it improve the visual impairment or cognitive disability. You wanna make sure that you are clear and concise so that people can actually focus on your content and what the info what information is important. Now did you know 1 in 12 men and 1 in 200 women experience some level of colorblindness. 1 in 12 men. That's a lot. That they you probably know 2 or 3 people in your circle that are colorblind.

Erin Perkins [00:11:58]:
Part of enhancing your link is also considering color and color contrast. So the goal for this is aim for good contrast ratio. You wanna make sure that you have a 4.5 to a one for normal text and then a 3 to 1 for large text. If a user is color blind, they may struggle to differentiate between the text. So I have a really a couple of examples here. So this is Protanopia, which means they usually can't see red red or green in that content. So I have on the left hand side my actual email. This is what it looks like to me.

Erin Perkins [00:12:51]:
It's all color. But if you're color blind and you don't see the red and green, you can tell that the colors shift significantly. And the thing I wanna highlight the most is the fact that I have used shown in to use purple as my link selector. However, when you look at if they call it personal color blind, they would not be able to the the color differentiator. It literally looks like the that same color as the to your text. It is why I would encourage you to think about adding at least 2 more differentiator, bold and underline. This is gonna help your reader so much. This is it another one, tris tritanopia.

Erin Perkins [00:13:42]:
That this is also it showed you that you can still see the color differentiator, but they're losing some color. So so it's not exactly the same, but it stand out a little bit, but you're still able to see it. I also encourage you to so those are the 2 different thing to think about. I use this app called, are mycolorsaccessible.com. And one of the thing I do is I enter all of my HEX code. I put in all my HEX code, and it will tell me what color I can use with what. For instance, I have a lot of yep for, like, the navy blue can you be used with any color except for the dark purple, which kinda makes sense. And then with the orange, it can only be used mainly with the navy blue, maybe with the dark purple if it's larger text.

Erin Perkins [00:14:47]:
But every other color with orange is not gonna work. Though these though, I strongly encourage you to go to the website and use that to build out your color contrast. The last thing I wanna share with you is emoji user. I do encourage you to minimize your emoji users because it is problematic. I would like to show you an example, a video. So we So how did that sound to you? If you use emojis at bullet points, it's gonna sound very, like, overwhelming. It's gonna be like, wait. What is happening? Because the screen reader literally reads out what that emoji is and then the sentence.

Erin Perkins [00:16:07]:
So I am not telling you you should stop using emojis, but I want you to be more strategic about it. Don't use it as a bullet point. Use emojis at the end of a sentence. There's way more accessible at this point. So to recap, we have, segment your list. Ask them what is their preference. If they want text only, they want design email, everyone has a preference. Maybe it's a little bit more work for you, but it could still mean a lot to people.

Erin Perkins [00:16:48]:
Think about your link. Make sure they're descriptive enough, but they're short enough so that they understand what is happening. And in addition to the link, making sure that you're using 2 more differentiator beyond color. And then the last one is emoji user. Just think about it using more strategically, and then it'll be a lot easier for you to do. If you have any question, I have included a freebie that is gonna help you with instituting a lot of these things for your email marketing. Remember, keep building your email list. That's the only list you own.

Erin Perkins [00:17:31]:
Alright. Thank you.

[00:00:00.000] - Liz Stapleton, Host
All right guys, I'm really excited to have the speaker back at the Blogger Breakthrough Summit. She's spoken a couple of times, and I always learned so much from her. I'm always trying to get a little bit better every year. A big warm welcome to Erin Perkins. She is the CEO of MabelyQ. She's deaf-blind, although you may not be able to tell just by looking at her. She started out under the guise of being an operations manager and graphic designer and then quickly realized that business owners don't know a whole lot about accessibility. And so she's pivoted to teaching businesses how to be accessible, leaning on her life experiences and her mission is to make the world more accessible one business at a time. She's definitely helped mine. I'm getting there. Thank you, Erin, for coming back.

[00:00:53.320] - Erin Perkins
Thank you for having me. It's really awesome to be able to speak to a Blogger Breakthrough Summit, I love speaking to you guys because blogging has my heart through and through. I still read blog to this day. I was reading blogs way back when I was 15, 20 years when it first came out. I'm still a loyal blog reader, so don't stop.

[00:01:18.480] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Yeah, I started my first blog in 2014, but then I realized I actually did a live journal in 2009, way back. So I hear you. Okay, so we're going to be talking about accessibility. And I think a lot of bloggers, the only thing that maybe would come to mind is like alt text, but it's so much more than that. I mean, that's a great place to start. But what are some of these things you see bloggers just completely missing?

[00:01:53.600] - Erin Perkins
One, the biggest one, because now I feel like bloggers have been making a lot of videos over the past few years, is they're missing out on capturing the video. They might think that, Oh, maybe they're just playing music or something. But make sure you highlight that there is music playing. Even if it's just at the very beginning, just throw in there that whatever music, say you have a little instrumental going, throw that in there and say that there's music coming because otherwise we wouldn't know what's happening and we're like, Wait, are there captions or are they not? Just enabling that and adding that in is just that simple, but it creates a better experience.

[00:02:43.250] - Liz Stapleton, Host
It's impactful. It gives the context.

[00:02:45.860] - Erin Perkins
Yeah.

[00:02:47.120] - Liz Stapleton, Host
I feel like if you're ever a little unsure of what to do, first of all, AI will help a lot, correct me if I'm wrong. Yeah, for sure. Go ahead next time you turn on Netflix, turn on captions, and you'll be able to see some examples, I guess, of Oh, it's intense music or it's whatever.

[00:03:06.620] - Erin Perkins
Yeah, just watch different shows on any channel, any streaming, and you'll see how the caption does. Not everybody does it the same way. But one other thing I do recommend when you do caption, keep it the standard, like black box. Maybe you can make it a little transparent with white text. Because that's just like a standard. Don't try to colorize it. Don't try to make it fancy and stuff. Don't try to be artsy. It needs to be legible.

[00:03:42.240] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Yeah, is there? And I think, so I was actually just watching a training on building accessible websites because I'm building a custom site for this summit. Hopefully you all are enjoying it when you're watching this. But isn't there like there's like a website where you can check to make sure your colors are contrasting enough?

[00:04:00.540] - Erin Perkins
Yeah. My favorite website is coolors.co. So it's like colors, but with double O's. And that one I find has been really easy to access, and it's just like putting your Hex code of your colors, see if it works. If it doesn't, then you might need to find a different color to make sure that all complements one another. Contrast is one of the highly missed things when it comes to colors. People will pick their own colors. I understand that. Sometimes you're going to pick your favorite colors or your brand colors, and they can still work. But my original colors for my branding was navy blue, and coral, but the contrast was never great. I would always have to add on more color to that. I'm a graphic designer by trade. That was one thing that frustrates me is that they never taught accessibility when it comes to design, and it's still the case these days. Now, when I'm teaching people, I'm like, You want to think about how the contrast is on your website, the colors and stuff. That way, when you're putting it out there, it really does have a good experience for people.

[00:05:27.300] - Erin Perkins
People are not like, Oh, my God, this is too bright. This is too dark. I can't read it. That's why when I speak about caption, this is the one thing I will stand behind because I grew up with it. Maybe this makes me old school. I like my black box with white caption. It's easy. It's all I know. The white caption, when all the letters are white, but there's no background, that's actually very hard for me to read because you never know what is going on in the scenery. Sometimes when you go to the movie, it's like, Wait, what was that word? Because the background is white too? You can't read that.

[00:06:09.180] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Yeah. I've seen people who have a teal footer and then pink text, and it's... Even for someone without any eyesight issues or different, that's hard to read. So just take a step back and make sure stuff is readable, not just like, Oh, it's.

[00:06:27.860] - Erin Perkins
Like a little - Still do your brand brand I have new brand colors. I had it redesigned a couple of years ago, and it's very color contrast friendly, but it's beautiful, at least I could say so.

[00:06:41.770] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Yeah, it's definitely possible. So don't think you can't use your brand colors, but just be mindful in the ways you use them would be probably the best approach. Okay, so we've talked about captions, we've talked about colors. We did briefly touch on alt text, and I'll let you chat on that in a second. But, what, let's take a step back and talk about the different tech that people with different abilities use to see a website or hear it, or that people should keep in mind when they're creating their content.

[00:07:14.700] - Erin Perkins
So, screen readers are very commonly used by a lot of people, more than you realize. The one thing I am going to tell people do not accessibility overlays on your website. That's just like a hard no. No accessibility overlays. The reason being, these companies are going to sell you on it. I'm going to be like, No, they're going to charge you outrageous amounts of money. It's not a good good thing, because when you think about it, most people with disability, we have already created our own system for what what works. We have our own setup. For me, for example, my setup was when I use this loop that I have around my neck, the black loop, it streams stuff to my hearing aid and my cochlear implant and it works for me. When I'm asked to wear different, like headphones it's not going to work for me because it's not compatible. I've already created a system that works for me. The same rings true for a lot of people with disabilities, they may use only only keyboard because they can't use a tracking pad or a mouse. Sometimes when you have an overlay, it interferes with the tech that they bought and set up for themselves because it's worthwhile for them.

[00:08:50.180] - Erin Perkins
Overlays, are literally a Band-Aid. If you want to think about it that way, they're a Band-Aid fix. Those band-aids always fall off, don't they? You know they suck. Let's not do that. Do it from the beginning. Build your your website, create access that way with your website. Don't just slap on band aid fixes.

[00:09:17.480] - Liz Stapleton, Host
I will say I think it's easier to build an accessible website from the beginning than it is to go back and fix fix it. I'm definitely in that boat where I didn't know any better when I started some of my websites. I'm still, years later being like, Oh, wait, that is missing an alt text. My very first blog, do as I say, not as I do, I totally used for a while headings based on how they looked and not necessarily...

[00:09:49.040] - Erin Perkins
I did too, 100%.

[00:09:51.620] - Erin Perkins
I think we all did. The website, content accessibility guideline, WCAG guideline, that is still a relatively new concept in terms of age. I don't even know how long ago it came out, but that concept is still new. Honestly, it is really hard for a lot of people to understand. I like tech, but I'm not a super nerdy, all into coding. I don't do any of that. I can't do any of that. My brain brain doesn't work like that. What I did was I went in and tried to learn so that I can turn around and teach all of you how to make your website accessible without even needing code. You don't need code. You don't need to know code. You just need to know how to do certain things to ensure that it's accessible. You're right, it is better to do it from the beginning. But if you have to take a step back, it's okay.

[00:10:58.120] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Yes.

[00:10:59.410] - Liz Stapleton, Host
You said there are some certain things that people do need to know how to do without coding to make their site accessible. You want to give a couple of examples?

[00:11:09.780] - Erin Perkins
One of the examples that you said that dropping in, the wrong Heading, and maybe you would create a graphic so that it is your your fits look. Don't do that. Just find a good picture, resize it according to how it is, put in the text that you need, and then look at how it it mobile versus desktop. That way you can see how it looks and make sure it flows on either one. You always want to check both sides. You want to make sure things are mobile-friendly. Most websites do allow you to push things up on either side. I use Squarespace. I don't use any coding whatsoever. It's literally I can rearrange things mobile and it doesn't affect my desktop. I really like that. If you're just starting out as a blogger, that's something you might want to consider. How are things laid out so that you can be able to make it how you want it to look without throwing in all the fancy fancy.

[00:12:22.740] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Yeah, and I think a lot of WordPress themes and things have that that built You click over and see what it looks like on mobile and make any adjustments you need. But it is something that I think a lot of bloggers are guilty of because we're always working on our desktops, and so we forget to see what our site looks like on mobile.

[00:12:41.280] - Erin Perkins
I I will say one of the things I've noticed, I like to read my blog on my iPad, and there's two or three that don't translate well on my iPad. Landscape it is really weird. If I try to turn it to portrait, but it won't resize, which I find really interesting. That's something you might have to consider. How does it look on different platforms.

[00:13:11.840] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Yeah, because some will do desktop, tablet, and mobile. I think in most instances tech-wise, if you adjust stuff on tablet, it's going to adjust it on mobile as well. Then you would want to go and adjust mobile because it'll adjust down but not up.

[00:13:31.310] - Erin Perkins
That makes sense. Then the other thing I want you guys to consider is the sizing of your picture photograph.

[00:13:38.600] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Okay.

[00:13:39.610] - Erin Perkins
I think that's a big thing because people who might be reading your blog might be in a low-access area. They might not have a lot of money, so the internet is low, not as high power that we're all used to. That's something you need to to consider quickly do those photos load on somebody else's website if they don't have high internet speed?

[00:14:07.920] - Liz Stapleton, Host
The file size.

[00:14:10.070] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Of the.

[00:14:11.150] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Actual image. Guys, there's tools that will help compress them without making them lose any quality. I use use short pixel on to help with file sizes and loading, and it just makes your site better if it loads faster for everyone.

[00:14:27.800] - Erin Perkins
Yeah, and that's what we're about, creating a better experience for everybody.

[00:14:32.140] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Everybody. Okay, so we talked about about sure you're using headings correctly, not stylistically, and checking your image sizes, I'm wondering, do you want to talk about, because I feel...

[00:14:46.590] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Sorry.

[00:14:47.020] - Liz Stapleton, Host
I'm wandering with this question, alt text. It's not necessarily required for every image, correct?

[00:14:52.810] - Liz Stapleton, Host
But how do you differentiate?

[00:14:57.090] - Erin Perkins
I mean, if it's a decorative image on on your website it doesn't necessarily pertain to the story you're telling, then you can get away with that. However, I feel like it's very tricky with bloggers because you all put in a lot of pictures, which I understand. I enjoy these pictures. Let me say say I'm a huge fan of Emily Henderson. Her blog is amazing. Her team does an amazing job. Pretty sure they probably don't put in in alt text in all their pictures because they load a lot of pictures in. I think that's something to consider. If you are a DIY blogger, if you want someone to understand and visually see all the steps that you're doing, you might need to copy and paste your steps and use that as alt alt text that can help the people follow along with the images. I think you need to… If you are a photographer, I think it's very subjective. Are you going to want to put in or test for every single one of that family, the same family, but it's just everyone posed differently? Probably not. But you still want to give them an idea of how much they are describing what they look like in some form or way, and then just say these are just different pictures of everyone posing.

[00:16:44.180] - Erin Perkins
I think you do need to think about how the pictures are the content of the picture and how to do it. But don't keyword stuff with with Don't just be throwing things in because Google will know when you're trying to stuff in all the keywords. So be mindful of how you're using your alt text.

[00:17:07.910] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Okay. No, I like that. I want to ask because I feel like it's just the direction that tech is heading. Ai is a great tool. I mentioned I use it to help me create my transcripts and captions as a step one. There's also AI for alt text. What are your overall thoughts on AI in helping a site gets become more accessible and the best practices.

[00:17:35.230] - Erin Perkins
I have tried AI for helping me create images, the image description, and I do think it's helpful. But don't just take what AI does and just throw it in there. There. I just thought I don't feel like you might have to, will have to edit some of those, but I think it's very helpful. I'm a big fan of AI. I think it really helps people get ideas going and stuff like that. Use it when you need to.

[00:18:06.220] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Are there any AI tools you would recommend to help people get their stuff in order if they have to go back and fix things.

[00:18:12.030] - Erin Perkins
I have to go back to, I can't remember those those AI I feel like there was one that was AI, AIAlttext I tried that out. It wasn't too bad, but it's probably better since last time I used it.

[00:18:29.230] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Okay. So starting off right is the best option, but if you're going back and fixing things, how would you prioritize different... What do you need to fix fix first and what is 'keep fixing it as you go' type of a a thing? Like is an emergency? I mean, it's all not great if it's not there, but what is something that, okay, keep working on it as you go versus this needs to be fixed now? Now?

[00:18:57.290] - Erin Perkins
I'm going to say that don't feel like you have to go back to every single blog and edit those. Don't feel like you need to do that. I would say definitely make sure the framework of your blog, all the stuff that is repeated throughout the website is all set and good to go. Then just start from where you're at now. Say that you are starting fresh February first, right after this Blogger Breakthrough Summit, you're like, All right, I'm ready to do this. All right, so now you're going to be just like take one by one, say, say, know what? I'm going to look at doing the alt text for this blog from this point. Once you feel like you've gotten comfortable with that, and then move on to the next step of that.

[00:19:47.850] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Okay, I like that. The framework, so things that you're talking about there, I just want to make sure I'm understanding, the theme, the footer, the header, the share buttons. Link colors

[00:20:04.090] - Erin Perkins
Anything that is is repeated, is basically the foundation of your blog. Make sure that's all good to go. Everything the images, the links all look good, the color, all of that. Once you have that foundation, good to go. And I would step into when you post your blog and make it go from there. Okay.

[00:20:29.980] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Okay. Looking at my... Oops, make sure I've got my notes and things. Okay, so we talked about video and captioning, but I feel... So video isn't just on a blog, though. Social media has hugely moved towards video. Besides captioning, are there other issues you notice notice with bloggers social media in terms of accessibility?

[00:21:03.570] - Erin Perkins
Hashtag.

[00:21:04.800] - Erin Perkins
If you're doing hashtag, you're going to want to make sure first letter of each word is capitalized.

[00:21:16.880] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Okay. Is that a screen reader? Otherwise, it's trying to sound out a whole word.

[00:21:23.510] - Erin Perkins
It's a screen reader, and anybody who might have a learning disability, they actually have trouble trouble working out those words. It's like for multiple purposes. The screen reader definitely can't read those. They're reading it and they're like, whatever that is.

[00:21:43.230] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Yeah, like as a single word.

[00:21:45.350] - Erin Perkins
Yeah.

[00:21:46.380] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Okay. No, I wouldn't have thought of that. Anything else you think would be helpful for bloggers to know in terms of just trying to create a better experience on their site?

[00:21:57.840] - Erin Perkins
I mean, it's just like being being outside your box, think outside your circle. Most people who follow you are following you for a certain reason. A lot of them probably have ADHD, any types of disability that they're not going to necessarily share with you. When you're sharing them your world, they want to be a part of your world. They want to have that access to you. That's why I fell in love with blogging. I never did blogging myself, except for when I was doing DayNote back in the day. But because I want to be part of your world, and the more you create that inclusive experience, I feel like you are writing for me. I remember one blogger they decided to switch totally over to podcasting. I was so bummed about it because I was like, You're leaving us behind because at the time, transcripts weren't coming out and stuff. That was very frustrating to me. It's like, think about the diverse people that you have in your world, and you're very fortunate to have them in your world. Make sure you create that better experience.

[00:23:20.870] - Liz Stapleton, Host
There's probably more of them than you think. Like you said, they may not stand up and be like, Hey, but there's probably a lot more than you realize.

[00:23:27.910] - Erin Perkins
I mean, at least 90% of disabilities are invisible. Yeah.

[00:23:34.030] - Liz Stapleton, Host
I will say I always working to make stuff more accessible. If there's some way that I haven't accommodated you, please do tell me. I will appreciate appreciate it, 

[00:23:45.600] - Erin Perkins
I taught you how to turn on zoom captions.

[00:23:49.340] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Yeah, very much appreciate Erin walking me through Zoom captions.. And I mean, so first year I did the summit I didn't have any transcripts because I was like, I can't do this much work. But I was hand trying to do transcripts. But I've developed systems over the years, and I'm slowly going back and adding transcripts to those earlier sessions. So if there's something, especially regarding the summit, because it is time sensitive, please reach out because I will work with you to get you what you need.

[00:24:23.380] - Erin Perkins
For sure.

[00:24:24.280] - Liz Stapleton, Host
I just wanted to say that. Erin, I know you have some resources for for attendees. You want to tell us about them?

[00:24:32.210] - Erin Perkins
I believe the Freebies the Social Media Accessibility correct?

[00:24:39.220] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Okay. If you say it is, then it is.

[00:24:43.210] - Erin Perkins
Okay. All right. Then the other thing that is for the VIP or Access Pass. Whoever you are.

[00:24:51.070] - Liz Stapleton, Host
 Whatever we're calling it. It.

[00:24:53.130] - Erin Perkins
Yeah, everyone calls it different. For you guys, you're going to get a checklist that is going to help you walk through what things you should be looking out for to make sure your website foundation is all set to go and then you can hit the road running.

[00:25:12.530] - Liz Stapleton, Host
I like it. Awesome. Definitely, guys, check that out. The link for the social media accessibility info is below. Then if you haven't already upgraded, you can do that to get that fantastic checklist from Erin as well. Erin, thank you so much for coming back and teaching me and being part of this community.

[00:25:29.760] - Erin Perkins
I love being part of this community. You guys are awesome. Keep blogging people.
