[00:00:00.000] - Liz Stapleton, Host
All right, guys. We are here today with Tracie Fobes from traceyFobes.Com. Tracie, welcome. Thank you.

[00:00:06.410] - Tracie Fobes
Thanks for inviting me.

[00:00:08.140] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Yeah. And we're going to be talking about sponsored posts or sponsored content. It could be various things. And I'm really interested in learning about it because I actually haven't done sponsored content that much. I've been blogging for over five years, and I've maybe done two sponsored content, like total.

[00:00:27.450] - Tracie Fobes
So.

[00:00:28.490] - Liz Stapleton, Host
I'm excited to learn more about this because I know it's something you've had a lot of success with. Do you want to just give us a little bit about your background and some of the stuff we'll cover today?

[00:00:37.540] - Tracie Fobes
Absolutely. So yes, I am Tracie Fobes, and a lot of people know me through my first website, which was pennypinchinmom.Com. And I started that in 2009, figured out how to monetize that, and grew that over 11 years. And this last about a year and a half ago, I started having more people ask me about how to do what I was doing, including the sponsored posts and how I was making money. So I started moving into coaching, and I realized this is where I want to be. I loved doing the site, don't get me wrong, but I had moved on from that. So this last summer, I've been hemming and high. What do I do with Penny Pinchin Mom? And someone approached me to buy it. And so in October of last year, we finalized our contracts, and I sold my first website, which was pretty darn incredible. What was really cool about Penny Pinchin  Mom was that's where I learned. And at the point that I sold that site, I was making five figures a month continuously just from sponsored work. And because it was such an integral part of the income structure for that site, that's what led me to want to teach others how to do that because we need content and sponsored posts just makes sense.

[00:01:52.880] - Tracie Fobes
So that's what's led me to where I'm at today.

[00:01:55.900] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Awesome. Yeah, no, I like that. That's nothing to sneeze at. That's oftentimes a lot more than people are making 9:00 to 5:00s or whatever when they're working on building their blog if they aren't full-time yet. So what are some of the things you think we want to make sure to cover today?

[00:02:15.190] - Tracie Fobes
Okay, I want to talk about first we want to go over the legal mumbo jumbo, because everybody knows you've got to have your legal stuff. So we'll cover that. We're also going to talk a little bit about where to find these sponsors, because that's the struggle a lot of people have. We'll talk about a few tools to have at your disposal. So when you do get maybe somebody emailing and you start talking to someone, you can give them great information. We're also going to talk about the number one question every person has is, How much should I charge? That is really where the magic happens. And there are so many things that people need to consider that you might actually be surprised at where I'm going to tell you to start your sponsored post pitch.

[00:02:56.560] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Okay. I'm excited for that. And so we are going to talk legal stuff just so you know. It's informational educational only. You should maybe talk attorney if you have questions or concerns. We do have three sessions on legal stuff, related to blogging, in the Summit. So definitely check out those as well, all with attorneys. Okay, so let's just start. Well, actually, before we dig into that, what is a sponsored post?

[00:03:22.470] - Tracie Fobes
Okay, a sponsored post is an article that you write on your site or you do a social share or something on behalf of a brand, a company or another party, and they pay you to do that. So it gives you ideas as to what to write about, but then they're giving you money to write on their behalf.

[00:03:42.690] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Okay. And because you're being paid for this, this is where the legal stuff comes in. The Federal Trade Commission, FTC, requires that you disclose this at the top before you even dig into the content.

[00:03:55.300] - Tracie Fobes
Absolutely. Just like if you do affiliate marketing, we always say you have to put, Hey, this post contains affiliate links. Blah, blah, blah.... It's the same thing here, except this time we have to say, This is a sponsored post on behalf of company name. All opinions are my own, point blank. The reader has to realize that when it is sponsored, they need to know that this article you're about to read, someone paid to put it here. There is a reason it's on my site. I'm going to be talking a lot about this company, and I'm going to be saying these things about them. So if it appears to read like an ad, that's why.

[00:04:35.540] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Okay. Yeah. So make sure you do that disclosure. Make sure it's at the top.

[00:04:39.800] - Tracie Fobes
Absolutely.

[00:04:40.860] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Okay. So now you know what it is, what you have to do before the content is showing up on your site. How do you find opportunities?

[00:04:49.510] - Tracie Fobes
Okay. So there's a couple of different ways. There's three different directions you can go. One is through networks. The second is to pitch yourself. And the third is you get pitches back to you. So I just touch on each of those. So networks are out there where you can sign up. And these companies that want people to write, they come and find you through them. One of them, for example, is called Izea, I-Z-E-A, free to join. And you sign up, you connect your analytics, your accounts, everything, your social. And then what happens is these companies who are looking for somebody who maybe has the same target audience that they want to reach, the same demographic, the same social, they will reach out to you to say, Hey, we think you're a fit. We'd like you to write for us. And you go from there. There's also where you pitch. This is where you cold email companies. For example, if you happen to be a financial blogger and you follow Dave Ramsey, you might pitch their PR department and say, Hey, I write this a site. I think that your every dollar app early, I can't think of the name of it, but I think it's.

[00:06:00.380] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Everyi don't know. Literally, my personal find my most popular post is why I don't like it.

[00:06:05.190] - Tracie Fobes
Okay, you see, it's funny. That's the whole point. You reach out and you're like, I think this would be a fit. Let's talk. Then you start the conversation and you go from there. And the third kind is where the company comes to you. And once you start writing more and you have more of a social presence, you'll start to get these emails. A lot of times they might be DMs through Instagram, or they could be messages on your site, direct emails, et cetera. But then companies are going to come to you and say, We think you are a fit for, fill in the blank, and we would love to work with you to create sponsored content. So that's the different ways we find the people that want to work with us to give us, or to pay us to write on our site about them.

[00:06:48.020] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Yeah. I just want to take a note there because the two I've done, they've pitched me, right? As you said, they think they're a great fit. You want to make sure they're a great fit. You don't just want to take every opportunity just for the money because it's really disingenuous to your audience.

[00:07:04.790] - Tracie Fobes
Absolutely. So one of my funniest pitches was when I got a request, we wanted to do a sponsored post, etc, and it was some a bidet company. I write financial work. I'm not going to write about bidets. But it also comes to something you can't get behind. I didn't believe in credit cards for years. I would get pitches from companies to write about credit cards. I couldn't do it because ethically, I couldn't write about that. So it's not even just a fit for your audience, but it is also something you personally can support. Do not sell out for a buck. Whatever you do, that's not going to help you.

[00:07:43.030] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Yeah, totally. Yeah, I remember I would get a lot of pitches because my personal finance was less debt, more wine, and it's about money. But I would get all these pitches for alcohol or a party thing. And I'm like, You clearly didn't look at what my site was. You saw the wine part, and I was like, That's not at all related to what I'm doing.

[00:08:05.830] - Tracie Fobes
Yeah. It's one of the things that I think that you get so excited when someone wants to pay you that you jump with the dollars. And we just can't do that as bloggers because your integrity trumps money every day of the week.

[00:08:20.060] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Absolutely. Yeah. So I just wanted to touch on that. Okay. So once you've found an opportunity, you received one, what's that pitch look like? What's that next step if you get a pitch that you're actually interested in taking up their offer?

[00:08:36.000] - Tracie Fobes
So yeah, that's a great question. So once you get a company that's like, Hey, we'd like to work with you. The next thing you always want to do is like, Great. Here's my media kit. Your Media Kit is a resume that we have for our blog. It includes a lot of factors. You will tell them who you are. You're going to include your target audience, who it is you are writing for. Because let's say you write about retirement, and this is a company about retirement, but they're targeting the 40-plus crowd. You write for the 25-40 crowd. Your audiences are different. You want to have your audience in there. If you've worked with other brands in the past, you want to mention who you've worked with. Because when you can name drop, like I was able online, I've worked with Staples and Dollar General and Walmart and Target, these national companies that made people go, Oh, my gosh. If they worked with her, we need to work with her. You'll also include general stats such as your page views, your social accounts, different things like that. And the most important thing you have to have on there is your contact information, not your phone number.

[00:09:40.220] - Tracie Fobes
Do not put your phone number on there because you do not want that out there. Trust me.

[00:09:44.840] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Unless you have a Google phone number or something.

[00:09:46.180] - Tracie Fobes
Unless you have a Google voice number, that's fine. But your cell phone? Yeah, you don't want that on there. That would be a big mistake, trust me. But that's your media kit. Then the next sheet that you want to have is what we call your rate form or your rate sheet, and it is the supplement to your media kit. Your rate sheet is where you let people know what you charge. My trick that I recommend is the three-tiered rate sheet. Tier one is basic. I will write a post about you. That's it. So the second one can be something I'll write a post. I'll share it on all these social channels. I'll put it on Pinterest. I'll put it in my newsletter. You can put different things. Your top one can be, I'll do a video. I'll do all these extra things. And you have levels that people buy. The funny thing when you do that, you might experience what I do. I never had anybody buy my least expensive package. They always started with my second one because they wanted more. So we want to think about that when it comes to your pricing structure.

[00:10:48.190] - Tracie Fobes
So you pitch that back to them, and then you might even have some ideas. Hey, yeah, I think you're a fit. Here's what I think we should do. I think I should write a post. I think we could do really good with this, or I think it'd really be fun to do a Facebook Live where I'm using your product, or I'm planning on going there anyway. Can I just tweet and use a special hashtag where I'm talking about my experience? So you have to think about how you think you could use that. Some brands will already know what they want, and you can see if that works, but you start giving ideas as to what you're comfortable doing, because you don't want them to come and say, Yeah, we want you to have a Twitter party, and you're like, I've never done that, because you're not comfortable with that. So you just start the conversation and once you agree on the price, we're going to come back to another legal thing, which is your contract, not an attorney. I don't play one on TV. We have a.

[00:11:38.120] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Session where we talk about contracts as a blogger, that it's.

[00:11:43.880] - Tracie Fobes
So overlooked. But yeah. Yeah. Then you do your contract and you go from there.

[00:11:48.170] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Okay. And I'm just going to dig in a little bit more on this because I feel like it's a place people really get hung up on it, is pitching themselves. It's one thing if you find an opportunity on a network that is, they're looking for pitches, right? Absolutely. Or someone pitches you. But if you are totally in love with company, you use it all the time, you're like, I would love them to pay me to talk how obsessed I am. I feel like people get a little hung up on that. So any suggestions or tips on that front?

[00:12:21.330] - Tracie Fobes
Yeah. So the first thing you have to realize is you need to embrace your awesomeness. I mean, really, you're awesome. You've got a great site. You've got people who love you. If you don't believe me, go look at comments. Go look at feedback. Go look at your loves. All those things you're getting from social, to realize that I know this topic and people trust me. So that's the first thing is don't think you're not worth it, okay? Put that out of your mind. But then the next thing I tell people to do is you need to come up with a standard email. And what you will say is something like, Hey there, I was pitching you. Like, Hey there, I worked. My name is Tracie Fobes, and I'm used to Penny Pinching Mom. I run the website...Penny Pinching Mom. Our audiences align because just like you, I am trying to help families who are struggling to get out of debt, figure out how to do that when they can't put food on the table and they don't know which direction to turn. Here is a little bit more about my site.

[00:13:17.320] - Tracie Fobes
I started it here. Here's who I'm talking to. Here's a little bit about my background. Our audience is aligned. Here's my social. You talk about, here's what we have on social. We've got 600,000 on our Facebook page. We've got about 30,000 in our private group. Our newsletter reaches around 50,000 people every time we email, et cetera, et cetera. I think we should work together because I think your product is a fit because of, boom, why are they a fit? It's not just we have the same audience, what is it that you think is a fit between their product or their company and your site? You also want to talk about, I would love to work on a sponsored post with you where I can talk about your product, or you could say, I would love to write a post and also review your product because of this, or I would love to do a video showing me doing this product, or a live Q and A on my Facebook group talking about your service. So then you put in what you're thinking, and then you say, I look forward to hearing from you. Do not talk rates in email number one.

[00:14:25.310] - Tracie Fobes
Never, because you need to leave that open, because just because you have certain rates, they might pitch something totally off the wall that you could charge a lot more money for, and you don't want to get locked into charging them something that devalues your work. But what you will do is you'll get them your first page media kit with all of your stats on it, and you say it in there. I don't have mine very long. Mine were four paragraphs, no more than 2-3 sentences per paragraph. Short, sweet to the point, because they don't want to read an email about your whole life history from the time that your dad left the house when you were five and he went and he got hit by a car. They don't care about that, right? They care about her here and now.

[00:15:10.550] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Yeah. Okay. And I do want to, because you threw out some big numbers social wise, even if you aren't that big doesn't mean you can't- Exactly.

[00:15:22.170] - Liz Stapleton, Host
-my first sponsored post of the two I've done. I've been blogging for a year or so, and I was tiny. And I still got someone to pay me 100 bucks, 200 bucks. It wasn't a lot. I probably could have charged more, but I have no clue what I was doing. So just because you don't have like.

[00:15:41.150] - Tracie Fobes
50,000- I have in a lot of Facebook groups, and I keep saying this thing. Oh, you need 10,000 page views before you can do a sponsored post? No, you don't. What the sponsor is looking for is who you target. Let's think about, for a second, Pinterest. You see these people with like 10 million monthly viewers, right? And you see another one with 100,000 monthly viewers. What you don't know is they both get the same amount of traffic. Because the one with 100,000 is highly targeted, and they know what they're doing, and they're reaching the people that matter, where the other one is just flying in the wind, throwing spaghetti.

[00:16:21.160] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Against the wind. It's got tons of graphics people love and repin.

[00:16:24.270] - Tracie Fobes
But aren't- Exactly, right. It doesn't mean anything. So you want to make sure that you realize, I don't care if you have 20 people on your Facebook page, and you're getting a thousand page views a month, you can still do a sponsored post. You can't charge as much as the person who has more, but so what? I mean, I would take 250 bucks any day of the week over nothing. Yeah. So yeah, don't think you're too small. Don't think you're too new. Now I will say you can't start your site last week. You do need a little longevity. I would say I don't look at sponsored posts until you hit that six to eight month mark because you know what you're doing. You're getting to learn your audience. You're settled into your group. So once you hit that point in your blogging journey, that's when you can start thinking about sponsored posts.

[00:17:15.640] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Absolutely. Yeah, I totally agree with that timeline. Okay. So once you've got an opportunity, you've got a contract in place, and guys don't be afraid to review and ask for changes to your contract. I feel like bloggers have a really bad habit of just taking contract and be like, okay, and not being like, actually-.

[00:17:43.550] - Tracie Fobes
Because they're notorious for sliding in things like, you can't work with anybody else for a year.

[00:17:49.970] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Yeah. Non competition, not to apply.

[00:17:52.360] - Tracie Fobes
Exactly. I had somebody do that to me once and like, we have to have it. And I said, okay, then you're going to pay five times my rate. Guess what happened the next morning? I had a new contract in my inbox.

[00:18:02.820] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Yeah, exactly. If they are going to ask for non compete, then they need to pay you that exclusivity.

[00:18:09.340] - Tracie Fobes
I'm a freelance writer.

[00:18:10.430] - Liz Stapleton, Host
I'm like, I'm a freelance writer. Are you kidding me? And they're like, Oh, no. And half the time the editor, I mean, that was writing, right? Editor didn't know. They just forwarded the.

[00:18:21.980] - Tracie Fobes
Contract, right? Exactly. Yeah. They don't know. So yeah, review that. Things like in that contract look for things like access to your images. Do they get to use your images as they see? Do they get to reproduce your content somewhere? I mean, there are so many things they slide in. Do not be afraid to say no.

[00:18:39.590] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Yeah, exactly. Okay, so contract is signed, you've reached an agreement. How do you make this go well? Because I feel like a lot of people, what they do is they get the contract, they get the money, they write the post, and they're done. But the reality is to be more profitable, there's a lot more.

[00:18:57.360] - Tracie Fobes
You can do. Exactly. So what you want to do is you have to consider a few things. So within that contract and stuff, maybe you can use affiliate links because let's say it's a company that sells something and they're on one of your ad networks or your affiliate networks, and so they might be able to put some of those in there. So what I always say to do, and I'm probably one of the few people to do this, I always offer my sponsors a pre-preview of the content, and I make it very clear that the only changes they are allowed to make is to factual information about the product that may be stated incorrectly. For example, if I was offering an app and I said that you had a 14-day trial and they're like, Oh, no, we've changed that. It's now 21 days. I'll change that. If I say the app was a little tough to get to download and to get signed up, they can't say, No, it's not. Here's why. Nope. My review, my words. So I always put that to them, and they really appreciate that because they're paying me so they can see it.

[00:20:03.220] - Tracie Fobes
There's not these surprises, because invariably what will happen is you're going to hit publish. They're going to review it and go, Oh, wait, you said this wrong. You said this wrong. You said this wrong. Right? And then you have to change it anyway. Do that on the front side. That's one thing that I do. The minute you hit publish, there on your social do all of that. Send an email right away to your sponsor say, Hey, we're live. Here is a link to the post. Here are all of the social links. Here are the hashtags I use. That way they can follow everything. They can follow all of the, if it's trending, they can follow up with comments. Like on Facebook, they can pop in and answer questions, et cetera. Another thing I tell people to consider using are tracking links. Now, some sponsors will want to track link clicks within your article, and they will give you a tracking link so they see it on their site. You can also use these by going into Google and creating these trackable UTM codes or using Bitly or something like that, so you can track those clicks.

[00:21:05.600] - Tracie Fobes
You have Pretty Links something, but you can provide link tracking. Link tracking is something I charge extra for, just saying. But you can put that in there. So you can say, Okay, at the end, I'm going to talk about the end, when we're done with all this, something that happens a couple of weeks later, we can give them some information that makes you stand out from your competitors because you are doing something on the back end of your sponsored post that most people are not doing. But that's what we do. You want to do keyword research because you want to make sure it ranks. So don't forget to do that keyword research. You could even ask your sponsor, are there keywords you are targeting? Because if you ask them, they see, Oh, my gosh, they are really putting forth effort to make sure this article can rank on Google as well for us. Another win in your pocket and something a lot of your competitors may not be doing.

[00:22:01.250] - Tracie Fobes
But these.

[00:22:01.800] - Tracie Fobes
Are the little things that we do. Proof it like three and four times, like upside down, backwards and forwards. Check the sponsor's name spelling. I can't tell you how many times I've seen where somebody spells the sponsor's name incorrectly, or they linked to the wrong page for the sponsor or something like that. Check them upside down, backwards and forwards. You want to make sure that all of your links have a note. It's called rel equals sponsored is the new code Google wants us to use that signals to Google. I'm not trying to boost their ranking. You're going to show your sponsor that you are in compliance with Google.

[00:22:36.830] - Liz Stapleton, Host
And if they ask you to not do that run away-.

[00:22:40.260] - Tracie Fobes
Oh, my gosh. Right. Exactly. You hit the lead on- I.

[00:22:42.430] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Cannot tell you how many people like, you will get so many emails that are junk, they're like.

[00:22:47.110] - Liz Stapleton, Host
I'll pay.

[00:22:47.490] - Liz Stapleton, Host
You for this link. And it's like, No, that's not how this works.

[00:22:51.480] - Tracie Fobes
No. And that needs to be one of those first things that you talk about upfront to make sure that it's very clear in that negotiation process that every link will be no followed or using the sponsored tag. Right. Exactly. No follow- We're doing.

[00:23:03.950] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Tech sessions.

[00:23:04.820] - Tracie Fobes
Too, guys. We'll talk about that. Yeah, talk about that there. I'm just bringing, this is where that applies. Sometimes it's like that real life application. There you go. You're going to learn the tech stuff and I'm telling you now is where are you going to use that? But that'll be part of your whole negotiation process. You also want to make sure that you include, I always say like three to five links to the sponsor, no more. You're not going to link. Every time I mentioned the word lending tree, I'm not going to link to that. How many times in an article? I probably all mentioned them 30 times, 30 links. Holy heck, that's too much. So make sure you link at the first paragraph, there's a link. You have a link at the very last paragraph, and you link to the throughout the article.

[00:23:44.280] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Kind.

[00:23:45.080] - Tracie Fobes
Of like you would affiliate links because you have sponsors who are like, they'll look at your article and they want you to start linking to them more? Yeah, no, because it looks too addy. It just doesn't work. So yeah, that's what I do. When they get that back, hit your deadlines. There is nothing worse than saying, I will put this post live at 10:00 a. M. On January 23rd, and it's 4:00 p. M. And you're like, Oh, crad, I didn't get done yet. Don't do it. Stick to your timelines.

[00:24:10.530] - Liz Stapleton, Host
That's just a profession to build- It is. -from a professional standpoint. I think that is all some great information. I'm trying to see if I have other... Oh, I did want to ask, how much do you charge extra for the link tracking?

[00:24:24.910] - Tracie Fobes
So the link tracking, because I have to build that and provide that report, I'll charge $100 to $150.

[00:24:29.700] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Okay. So we're going to talk how do you decide what's charge?

[00:24:34.230] - Tracie Fobes
All of you guys are like, listening to this whole session. I'm sure waiting. Come on, tell me what I can charge. So your site is brand spanking new out of the box. You've been blogging for six months, $250 to start. Never accept less than $250. And the reason is your time. You have to write the content. You have to edit the content. You have to do all these things. Your time is worth something. This is not... Don't think, Oh, I don't have any traffic. I can't charge very much. Yes, you can, because it's on your site, freeging forever.

[00:25:13.750] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Well, unless you put in-.

[00:25:15.310] - Tracie Fobes
Unless you paid the same thing. Unless you paid the same thing. Unless you put in a.

Year- Unless you.

[00:25:17.280] - Tracie Fobes
Paid and joined in a year- Unless you're in a contract. Most sponsored work will be on your site for eternity.

[00:25:22.160] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Yeah. So I always add in the contract that I can't take down after. And I was like, chances are I'm not going to. But if I change directions on my site, I don't have to keep up content. And I've heard horror stories of someone being like, I took down a sponsored post and then two years after the fact, and they did a thing through PayPal to get the money back.

[00:25:46.170] - Tracie Fobes
Yeah. You do want to make sure that's in there. That's part of it, though. And they're using your site for ranking in Google. They're using your platform and your voice. They need to start. That's where I start. Then I do all the add-ons, so I have my base. Then we look at page views, and we have a range that we can go from low. We can charge like two and three dollars RPM for your page views, up to seven and eight dollars RPM, just like an ad network, because this is an ad. So we add that in. Then we add in ranges for social engagement and interaction, not just numbers, engagement. Because if you have a Facebook group with 20,000 people in it, but no one responds, who wants to pay for that? But if you have one with 10,000 and it's really active and you have good engagement, you can use those numbers. So we look at that. We look at Instagram. We look if you have a YouTube channel. We look at all those different social accounts, Pinterest, all these different things, and we come up with a base. Then we start add-ons, add-ons, newsletters, call-outs, and we can charge so much for newsletters, and we do rates on there.

[00:26:57.020] - Tracie Fobes
Not only the number of people on your list, but your open rates. Because I can have a list and I'm only getting a 10 % open rate, that's not worth as much as somebody who has an open rate of 35 % or your open rates. If they want video, if they want live, if they want you to go shopping on their behalf, if they want you to take your own pictures, all these different pieces, you start tacking on fees. The basic post, that's one thing. Most people don't want the basic post. They want all the fancy stuff. And so they want the fancy stuff, just like you go to those really expensive restaurants, everything's a la carte. It's all a carte when it comes to your sponsored rate as well. And what's really cool is in the store that I created, because this is so much, like how do I know what to do? I put together a calculator. You literally put in numbers, and it figures you guys rates. I had to do it every time, and I'm like, I'm so tired of manually doing this. I created this worksheet I was using for my sponsors, and then people asked me for it.

[00:28:01.170] - Tracie Fobes
So that's something that I do have available because it's so hard to figure out what to charge. You don't have to use it. Just putting it out there that is something that is out there for you. Okay.

[00:28:11.540] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Two follow-up questions, because some people may not know what is RPM? Okay.

[00:28:16.280] - Tracie Fobes
Rpm is your rate. It's your rate you charge per thousand impressions. So if you get 10,000 page views and your RPM is four dollars.

[00:28:27.130] - Liz Stapleton, Host
That's.

[00:28:28.010] - Tracie Fobes
My brain is not working. $40. Yeah, $40. I'm sorry, it's early, but that's basically what you do. So you do a divisional rate. So you figure four dollars for every thousand. So you would take that 10,000, divide that by a thousand, and then take that times your rate to figure out what to charge. That's what advertisers use to figure out when you're earning money through them, they do that same general theory. Okay. Yeah.

[00:28:52.840] - Liz Stapleton, Host
And then the other thing I want to ask you is graphics because obviously blog post you're doing feature... Is that included in the base rate? Are you referring sponsors to give you some of that? How do you work that out?

[00:29:04.280] - Tracie Fobes
So when it comes to the graphics, what I look at is I ask the sponsor if they have screenshots that they would like me to use or other images. When it comes to the additional images that I'm going to use on my site, I buy them, and obviously we don't use free. I go to reputable sites, I've remixed, deposit photos, one, two, three, RF, and I purchase the graphic that's going to be used. What a lot of times will do is I'll take two or three options. I'm like, Hey, here's the three images I'm thinking about using, and I'll just download the free watermarked copy, and I'll send that to the sponsor and say, Which one do you want? And then they can pick which one they like, or they might say, We have one we want you to use. If they give it to you to use, you are assuming that you have rights to use it, and they're on the hook if you don't. That's why I don't usually... I'm really careful with my graphics and images. I want to make sure I can use it. So I will usually buy them. I create my own pon.

[00:29:59.290] - Tracie Fobes
I create all of those things myself, because it has to be my esthetic, my voice and everything. I don't want somebody who doesn't get my brand to be creating something for me because then it's off brand and it doesn't fit. It doesn't mesh well, Pinterest, Facebook, Instagram, whatever.

[00:30:17.900] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Okay, perfect. All right. I think that was really all of my questions. I know you have a great free offer for attendees. Tell us about it.

[00:30:27.940] - Tracie Fobes
So what I've done is because I'm so big on learning, that's why I'm doing what I'm doing, I've got this free course. It's called Sponsored Success Incubator, and basically it's going to kickstart your understanding of doing sponsored posts. You're going to be able to get in there. You're going to talk about the legal stuff. We're going to talk about where to go find a sponsor. We're going to talk about all these little pieces. So you could really build your first sponsored post right when you get done with that. You don't even have to pay a penny, literally. Just take that freebie, dip your toes in and learn, because I don't want to be doing sponsored posts because it may not be a fit for you. I know some people that start and they're like, Yeah, no, I can't do this. So that's what I want. I want you to get some more understanding as to what these are about and how we go about doing them, so you know if it's a fit for you.

[00:31:21.210] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Yeah. And the link for that is below, guys. It's free. So it's really no risk.

[00:31:28.420] - Tracie Fobes
Exactly.

[00:31:30.040] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Okay. And then for those that purchase the All Access pass, you are also offering a great discount on a course. You want to tell us.

[00:31:38.340] - Tracie Fobes
About the course? Yeah. So I have my sponsored success course, which is extremely in-depth. It is video. It is swipe copy for those pitches you want to do. It's swipe copy when someone pitches you as to what to say back. Has Media kit templates, has the checklist in there so that you don't forget what to do. Invoice templates. There's access to a really super cheap, not cheap and quality, but a sponsored post contract written by an attorney for my course specifically. So it's got all of these different pieces. So when you start, it literally is going to step by step, put you right through doing everything. We even talk about what if they don't pay? You've even invoiced them at the end, and they're not paying you. What do I do now? All of these that go into sponsored posts because it's not as simple as you pitch me, I write a post, I send you a bill. There's so much more to it. And I want to make sure that you set yourself up for success with every sponsored post you write. Because when you do little things like, the one thing I said I didn't even touch on here, I'll just mention real quick.

[00:32:49.780] - Tracie Fobes
At the back side of your sponsored post, send your sponsor a detailed report recapping every link, recapping social shares, recapping page views, all of these different aspects from the post because you'll stand out that, Oh, my gosh. Here is a beautiful report of everything, so I'm not having to research this myself.

[00:33:13.900] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Yeah. And it makes it more likely they'll want to work with you again, right? Because the big money and sponsored content comes from working with, building partnerships with brands that you're working with repeatedly.

[00:33:24.950] - Tracie Fobes
Because a lot of them will come to PR firms, and that if they're in a PR firm, they're going to go, Oh, my gosh, we need to work with this person again for Company B and Company C and Company Z and all that. But that's all of what I cover in the course. And it's one thing, it's so funny. I'm one of these people that I'm a point here, click this, do that person. So when you take it, you're not left going, Okay, well, she said I should pitch, but how do I do that?

[00:33:49.740] - Liz Stapleton, Host
But.

[00:33:50.710] - Tracie Fobes
It's like the bonuses alone are worth more than the value of the course.

[00:33:54.870] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Yeah. And those that purchase the All Access Pass they get 30 % off.

[00:33:58.780] - Tracie Fobes
Yes. And I don't offer 30 % off anywhere else, just so you guys know.

[00:34:02.430] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Exclusive- Exclusive.

[00:34:03.610] - Tracie Fobes

[00:34:12.910] - Tracie Fobes
Like I said, I think you need to embrace the sponsored post. Don't be scared of it. Don't think you can't do them because you can't. Everybody can do sponsored posts. It's a matter of finding the right person who's going to pay you what you're worth.

[00:34:27.780] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Absolutely. All right, Tracie, thank you so much. I hope everyone got as much out of the session as I did. Thank you.
