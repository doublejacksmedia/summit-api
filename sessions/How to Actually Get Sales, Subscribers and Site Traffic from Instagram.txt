Brittany Verlenich [00:00:12]:
Hey, blogger. I'm so glad you are here. My name is Brittany Verlenich. By day, I'm a content strategist, social media manager, and total marketing nerd. But at night, I'm a blogger, and I have multiple niche sites ranging from elementary math to backpacking and hostels to travel opportunities and grants for teachers. So I'm really glad that you're here. I can't wait to show you how you can use Instagram to get the things that you actually need to succeed as a blogger, which is more site traffic, more email subscribers, and more sales. Before we dive into this session, I first want to address a couple of mindset shifts that I think will help you make the most of this session.

Brittany Verlenich [00:00:45]:
The first one is we really don't need to worry about followers as much anymore. I wanna address that because I wanna be really specific about why I didn't include that in the title. You don't need that many followers if you want to make a full time income, and that is definitely something I can help you do. By following the strategies and what you learn here in this session, you can definitely have more followers on your Instagram account as a by product of that. Because if we're creating better content that converts into the actions we want, then we get this positive feedback loop. Right? Because if you're growing your email list, people will come from your email list over to your Instagram. If they're buying things from you, they're gonna come back to you on Instagram later if we're setting these things up in advance. But I don't want us to be focusing on chasing followers anymore.

Brittany Verlenich [00:01:26]:
I don't think it's a fruitful act for us to do. I think there are better things for us to do with our time. Instagram itself is not where most of you are going to make money. Even though you may not feel like a business owner sometimes if you're a vlogger, you're a business owner as well. So you also need to be looking at things like reach and sales. My goal, my hope is to help you see that you can use not only Instagram, but all kinds of social media platforms to diversify your traffic and that we can use these social media platforms more intentionally to get them where we want them to be. Because even though Instagram is great, that's just the door, that's just the portal, that's where we meet them. So without further ado, let's get into the session.

Brittany Verlenich [00:02:00]:
Let's talk about how we can get more site traffic, sales, and subscribers using Instagram. And by subscribers, I mean email list subscribers here. Although, if you also have a YouTube channel or a podcast, you can use these same tips and tactics for that as well. Here's a quick agenda for us. We're gonna talk a little bit about Instagram as a platform. We're also going to talk about different types of Instagram content, both in format and in purpose and what each piece of content does. We're gonna share options for links. Practically, what is the how to step by step of how we get these links to the people who see our posts.

Brittany Verlenich [00:02:31]:
Let's start with Instagram 101. These are all the different types of posts and content you can create on Instagram. Reels are short form videos. They're up to 90 seconds long, and you can see them in 3 different places. On the profile grid, if you've allowed for it to be there, on your real squirt on your profile, and in the feed. If you use Instagram yourself, you've probably already experienced the feed. That's when you're flick flicking just like you would on TikTok. Carousel posts are those posts you see that have multiple images.

Brittany Verlenich [00:02:57]:
Sometimes they're photos, sometimes they're assets made in Canva or something like that. It just means more than one image where the action is to swipe. You also have single image or single photo posts, which you see on someone's profile, but sometimes they do come up in the feed as well. And aside from the reels feed, I should also say there's the explore area, which is like the for you page that we see on TikTok. That's another great place for you to get discovered. Your stories are those things you see when you're looking at people you already follow. There's actually a place you can go to see multiple stories or you might go to someone's profile specifically, click on their profile picture, and it will show you everything they've posted to their stories within the last 24 hours. And a live is just that.

Brittany Verlenich [00:03:36]:
It's a live stream. It's when you decide to go record in real time and hang out with people who are hanging out with you live. You can see just by looking at this screen that every single piece of content really does have its own purpose on the platform, and it really is like a funnel itself. I would urge you to think about where Instagram fits in your overall funnel. For example, if you don't have any other kind of content, if you only have a blog, you do wanna be thinking about, okay, is this the core way that people are discovering me?

Brittany Verlenich [00:04:02]:
If so, is Instagram

Brittany Verlenich [00:04:02]:
the place where I'm really gonna Instagram the place where I'm really gonna hang out and connect with them and nurture them? Maybe convert them to a sale depending on what kind of business you have? Or is Instagram where you're going to get discovered? Or ideally, are you trying to have both be your discoverability platforms? Because when you answer those questions, that's going to help you create a strategy that really works for you. I really don't believe that there are any one size fit all strategies on these platforms. We're just so different. For example, if you are a blogger and you sell digital products on Etsy, you're in a volume based business, especially if your products are $1-$5/$7. If you need to make $2,000 a month, you need to sell so many of those units in order to make $2,000. Right? So you need more people to see your products because not every single person who sees the product will buy it. On the opposite end, if you're a service provider, maybe you're a social media manager, you're a website designer, you design apps for companies, or even technically if you are doing brand deals or creating UGC content for brands, you're still technically a service provider. In that sense, you might not actually need to have a large audience because you are selling your skills and the end product for the person or company that you're working for.

Brittany Verlenich [00:05:13]:
You just need to be really strategic with your content. You don't necessarily need to have a large following. Even if you have a high volume based business like you're selling on teachers pay teachers, Amazon KDP, Etsy, or you're just going for site traffic so you can monetize your site with affiliate links and ads, yes, you do have a volume based business, but that doesn't mean you need to have loads and loads of followers. Of course, it helps if you do, but it's not necessary because every single post is going to act like a funnel in itself. Now that we know about the different types of content you can post in formatting, let's talk about how you can use them. As I mentioned before, reels are great for discoverability. We wanna make them as shareable and savable as possible. If you think about how you use Instagram yourself, you're probably sending reels to your friends, your partner, spouse, and they're ending up in their DMs.

Brittany Verlenich [00:05:58]:
So the more content you can create that is easily shareable, the better. What does this mean? You can post things about you where you're in it, depends on the kind of niche you have and the kind of content you're creating. But the more that you can actually create content that's about the viewer, the user, the reader, the better. That doesn't mean that you can't have a personal brand. It just needs you need to be thinking about how can I make this content about them even if it's your face on it? Carousels are also great for discoverability. At least as of when I'm recording this, you know, these platforms can change. But we've seen some shifts in people not just wanting to flick and scroll anymore. People are getting kind of tired of that.

Brittany Verlenich [00:06:32]:
I've been feeling the shift towards long form content again. I'm really excited about this trend actually. YouTube is having a heyday resurgence. More people are reading substack. More people are reading medium, which should be really exciting to you as a blogger because these were things that were really hot a few years ago, and they're kind of coming back. These things always trend in cycles. And anytime there's a push one way, like there's one push towards AI and automation, there's gonna be an equal and opposite push the other way, meaning more real time interaction with people, meeting people in real life, all that. And it's the same thing with content.

Brittany Verlenich [00:07:03]:
There's more snack size sized content. That means there's going to be more fuller, richer, nutritious content. Right? So that should be really good news for you as a blogger, but you wanna use these social media platforms and short form content to drive them back to your long form content and your other channels. Carousels are great for also shareability, and the more shareable, the better because people share them to their stories and they share them to individuals. They're also great for authority building and for nurturing. I usually see on client accounts because I manage people's accounts that carousels often get shown to people who are already following them. This isn't always the case, but it is often. Your stories are seen usually with people who are either following you or kind of lurking.

Brittany Verlenich [00:07:40]:
You might see the same faces and names even though they're not following you. They're seeing or following your stories. That happens sometimes. And for stories, what really works there is BTS or behind the scenes content. Your stories is also highly converting. It's where your superfans are most likely to show up because it's people who are checking in with your profile every day to see what you're doing, what you've posted, etcetera. That's also one of the few places on Instagram where you can share live links because you cannot share live links in post and in comments on Instagram. Lives are also great for conversions, although you have to be kind of strategic with those as well because the comments can disappear because I know that not everybody will use lives.

Brittany Verlenich [00:08:16]:
They are great in highly converting, but I usually recommend for people to make that call to actions. That's what CTA means, call to action, you want for them to DM you just because the comments might not show up and that can cause some problems with follow-up later. Okay. Let's talk about your profile for a second because it is very important. Usually, people are going to come across your content in the feed. They're either going to see the reel when they're flicking and scrolling. They're going to see the carousel post on their explore page, but they're not always going to come to your profile. Right? They actually might follow you and then go binge your other reels.

Brittany Verlenich [00:08:46]:
They might not even follow you, but they might go buy something from your bio. So there's all these different kinds of paths they could take. But if they do end up on our bio, we want for it to look professional and we want to be ready for them. Here are the things you need to have. Your handle is this piece up here. It's what people use to tag you or mention you in something. I have chosen for this account to go with a personal brand. You can decide to do that or you can do your store brand.

Brittany Verlenich [00:09:08]:
I've heard so many people ask me which one is better. It really just depends on you and how you want to show up. You also want to think about your eventual strategy with your business too. Are you growing a niche site that you eventually want to sell and you want to have an Instagram account that's an asset that goes with that? Or are you a personal creator and you might shift your niche over time? Those are some questions you might have to take some time to answer. So your handles here, when we talk about a username, typically we mean this bolded section right here. And this is, by the way, searchable. So if you type in social media strategist now I might not be the first one, there are other people who will pop up, but you want to have whatever you are in the online space pop up there. This is for a couple of reasons.

Brittany Verlenich [00:09:48]:
1, if you're any kind of service provider, freelancer, you want for people to find you when they're looking for people to work with. If you're a travel creator, food blogger, it's the same for you. If a travel brand or a luggage company is looking for creators to collaborate with, you wanna have travel blogger in your searchable title. And you actually do have a good amount of characters for this. I would recommend at least putting your first name and then at least one keyword search term here. Now you don't want to put too many because if it goes onto the second line, it looks a bit messy. Think about 1 or 2 keyword titles you'd like to rank for. So it could be travel blogger and UGC creator, for example.

Brittany Verlenich [00:10:24]:
It just depends on what you do and then what you create. Now for me, since I already have my first and last name in my handle, I don't really have to put my name on the username, but I choose to because I feel like it's just helpful for someone coming across my profile to know what is my name. Your bio is this part right here. It's these few lines that you get to see and talk about you and your brand. Notice that you can't always see the whole thing. That's why I wanted to show this clipped more part. They would have to tap on that if they're looking on their phone to see the whole thing. So those first couple of lines are very important, and sometimes even the third line gets cut off.

Brittany Verlenich [00:10:55]:
So I recommend having the first line be something that shows them what you do and, like, what they can expect from you. The second line is something that is memorable, maybe something you believe or something that makes you stand out. The third line could be either something that you're known for as far as, like, an asset or an achievement. You might notice that some influencers will say something like 200 k on TikTok, 40,000 subscribers on YouTube, something like that. That's partially because they want the brands to see that, but it also helps to build some authority and social proof for them. And then finally, you wanna have some kind of call to action. So you can see from mine, I have my arrows pointing down to my link. My core link is Fiverr because I'm really trying to drive traffic to Fiverr right now.

Brittany Verlenich [00:11:34]:
I'm building that up. And I also have other ways that people can work with me. So when they click on this link, they'll see all of my links for Instagram pop up. You can have 5 built into Instagram as of right now, so you don't need to have a link tree or a milkshake or a links page if you don't want to. You can have it on Instagram there for free. You also have this pink ring that comes up around the profile picture when there is a live and active story within the last 24 hours. So if you don't have stories on yours, then you won't see that. Some other things I wanna point out, you have notes right here, which if you remember and I know I'm dating myself here.

Brittany Verlenich [00:12:06]:
But if you remember, like, AOL instant messages, the away message that you would have, that's literally what it is. Only close friends or followers can see them. Just a really quick note about close friends. That's a group of people that you've given more access to. If you're an influencer, especially, that is a great offer you could do is you could make this like a paid subscription membership to have someone access your close friend's content, and that could be your whole membership. It's just additional content for your close friends. So that's something to consider because especially once you get used to creating content on Instagram or if you've already been playing with it, it's not that much more work to to add that in. Your archive is where you'll find old posts that you've already taken off the grid and your stories post because they only last for 24 hours unless you add them to highlights.

Brittany Verlenich [00:12:47]:
I don't know if we're going to have time to really talk about that. It really is its whole strategy. But those circles, those bubbles you see under someone's profile bio, those are highlights. You can actually take stories that you've posted and move them to highlights that they're seen forever later. Okay. Before we go any further, let's talk about some myths or I like to call them Instagram conspiracies because it's one of those things that you think is true just because other people have said it or you've heard someone say it. Trending audio, in my humble opinion, isn't all that, especially now. We've seen a big shift.

Brittany Verlenich [00:13:15]:
Instagram is favoring and people are favoring original content. They don't just wanna see and hear the same thing anymore. And that totally makes sense. Right? If we wanna follow people who are thought leaders, who are authorities and experts in their fields, why would we want for them to say the same thing as everyone else using the same sound as everyone else and creating the exact same kind of content as everyone else? I think trends in general are just boo. I don't really like them unless you're just doing it for fun. I do one for fun every once in a while, or if it makes sense for my brand, but in general, I don't love them. And same thing for templates. I'm a big fan of taking the time to create original thoughts or repurposing content you've already used.

Brittany Verlenich [00:13:50]:
Like, if you have a blog and or a YouTube channel and or a podcast, anywhere that you've been creating content consistently, take that, repurpose it, and use that to craft your Instagram posts. Information is out. Storytelling is in. So I know this session is very informational, ironically. There's still room for informational content on Instagram in your blog. But also remember that with AI, you can basically answer any question in the world within seconds. Right? Right? AI can't fake stories, at least not yet. Your personal lived experience is what makes you unique, especially in your brand.

Brittany Verlenich [00:14:18]:
That might be your expertise. Don't be afraid to dive into storytelling. Bring people into your world. Bring people into why they should care. We'll talk more about that in a bit as well. Be the primary source. I gotta shout out Nina Clapperton as far as content because she does a couple of things really well. She might actually be speaking at the summit.

Brittany Verlenich [00:14:38]:
Her content's so good. She does a good job curating content. For a while, when all the Google madness was happening, I was like, I'm only going to 2 sources. I'm going to Niche Pursuits and I'm going to Nina Clapperton because I don't have the bandwidth to watch all this other stuff. And honestly, it was making me kinda depressed. So I was like, I'm just gonna focus on what I can control and follow these 2 people who are taking the time to go through all this information for me and tell me what I actually need to know. So that is great content curation, but when you're the primary source, that's also great. So when you're developing your own case studies, when you have your own lived experience, I have a blog about teaching on a reservation and it is the top ranking for anything else because I'm kind of one of a kind with that.

Brittany Verlenich [00:15:17]:
There isn't a lot of content out there about that that people can speak from their lived experience. So I continually rank for that even though all of my blog posts aren't perfectly SEO optimized, they're optimized for the reader. And I'm a huge fan of that, by the way. Always optimize for the reader first, then do SEO later, at least in my opinion. There's no magic time to post. This is a question I've had so many times. Is this time better? Is this time better? It's actually going to be different for every single audience. Other things affect it too, like time of year, holidays, is your content seasonal, and also the platform.

Brittany Verlenich [00:15:49]:
Many people think that a post today is, like, gone tomorrow, but that's not true. I've had posts that are, like, 2 or 3 weeks old, sometimes even a month old, get a second wind and they get passed around again. Instagram just decides to bless it, I guess. So there's no magic time to post. You just have to experiment and see what works best with your audience. I've heard so many people say that they don't get as good of results when they use a scheduler. That's one of those things that might actually be true even though they all say at the head of Instagram that they don't hinder reach on post schedules. We're not sure if it's true, but I wanna say this.

Brittany Verlenich [00:16:20]:
If it comes down to you using a post scheduler or not posting at all, I would rather you use a scheduler. Because even if you get 10% less reach, if you still have a 1000 people going to see your product, that's still better than no people seeing your product. So when we're talking about content creation, batch creation scheduling, set it up in whatever way is going to make it easiest and most doable for you. Instagram always says it doesn't matter if you edit in the app or not, but I have seen that they do like it. For some reason, if I make a post in capcut or Canva or something and put the text in there and then post it on Instagram, but, again, use whatever platforms make the most sense for you. Meta does not like comment x for y anymore. That has been a tried and true strategy for the past at least two and a half years now. It's something I dive deep into on episode 48 of the social media magic podcast.

Brittany Verlenich [00:17:05]:
If you wanna hear that, I'm not saying it doesn't work. It definitely still works and it's one of the most highly converting calls to action there are, but Meta doesn't like it. And in fact, just this morning, I had a client message me about a post getting flagged. For some reason, Facebook sees it as engagement forming clickbait. At the same time, Meta also partners with ManyChat, which is all about that, and I'll explain that more in a minute. Sharing Reels to stories, in my opinion, is okay, but limited. If the reel is only 3 or 4 seconds long and it's really more so created for people who don't know you yet, then people who are looking at your stories are probably not going to get the most out of it. However, if it's a clip from your latest podcast episode or YouTube video or if it makes sense for people who are also following you to see it, then go ahead and share it to your stories.

Brittany Verlenich [00:17:46]:
Kind of related to the last one, there's no magical number of posts per day or week. It doesn't matter if you post 3 days, 4 days, 7 days per week. Post as often as you can without diminishing quality and without burning yourself out. When there's a new feature, use it. Instagram does like it when you test out their features, especially because they only roll their features out to a certain number of people before pushing it out to all users. So that gets a lot of data for them. They like it. They'll push out your post to more people when you play with new features.

Brittany Verlenich [00:18:11]:
Thumbnails and titles of reels do matter. It's very much like YouTube now. Even though we don't always see the full title when we're scrolling, we actually do see it for, like, a split second. You might not notice it because it's so quick. People are making so many micro decisions when they're scrolling to see whether or not they're going to stop scrolling, whether they're going to watch the whole thing, whether they're going to read the comments, whether they're going to read the whole caption, whether they're going to DM you. So let's give them every reason to do that. It's less important that your grid is pretty with the covers, and it's more important that the title and thumbnail of the reel shows the viewer exactly what it's about. When we're talking about carousel posts, you can have up to 20 images, by the way.

Brittany Verlenich [00:18:49]:
Now it used to be only 10. The first two matter a lot because Instagram will naturally do an a b test. They'll push your carousel post out to people, and they will see which people respond to better. Slide 1 or slide 2. So make sure those first two slides are really good, and your hooks do matter. You have hooks on the actual image or reel itself. You have the hook of the first line of the caption. The caption is the text below the actual post, and you have what you actually say or do in the reel or on the carousel.

Brittany Verlenich [00:19:15]:
I already mentioned how your follower count doesn't matter as much, so we'll skip that one. Views, I argue, are on their way out as a metric. They matter right now, but keep your eyes out and your ears on the ground because we are moving towards a more private Internet. We talked about already Instagram itself being a funnel and all these different features and formats working together to kind of take your viewer, your follower through a whole experience and journey with you. But you also do wanna think, as I mentioned earlier, where it lands in your overall funnel of your content. And you also wanna think of each post as a funnel. They have the first decision, am I going to watch this? 2nd decision, am I going to keep watching this? 3rd decision, am I going to read the caption? 4th decision, am I going to like or comment? 5th decision, am I going to share or save it? 6th decision, am I going to take action additionally? Like, am I actually going to use this information in my daily life? And by the way, that last one I would argue is the most important because if a piece of content is so compelling that it makes them want to to take action in their daily life, that's when they grab your lead magnet, that's when they buy your product, that's when they follow you, that's when they DM you, all those things we want for them to do. And keep it fun because if you don't enjoy social media, you're not going to want to spend the time learning about it, refining your craft, spending time on here, engaging, etcetera.

Brittany Verlenich [00:20:25]:
A cohesive look does matter on Instagram. I don't think it's the most important thing, but it does matter more there than on other platforms like Facebook threads and Twitter, for example. But you don't need to be a model or a designer. I know it's easier said than done, but don't get too stuck on your appearance. Just think of how you want your appearance to be as far as your brand and try to be as consistent as possible. You wanna have consistency not only in how often you post as much as you can and what you post, but also in your brand message. What is it that you really want for people to know? Ideally, you want to post as often as possible and have great posts as often as possible. But if you can't have both right now, just pick 1.

Brittany Verlenich [00:21:00]:
Do you wanna have fewer high quality posts or do you wanna go for quantity and just get better? There's no wrong answer here. And by the way, you can grow without reels. You don't need to have reels to succeed on Instagram. And by the way, if you break the mold, you'll stand out. So you'll probably notice as a user yourself, when you come across someone on Instagram that has amazing content, they've done something different, that's a good thing. If we do the things that others are not willing to do, we're going to have results that others will not have. Every single post has a purpose. You either want to persuade, inform, or entertain in your content.

Brittany Verlenich [00:21:30]:
I've left some examples on the screen for you. And this is probably what you learned in grade school because I was an elementary teacher, so this is what I taught. But the best content does more than one thing at the same time. If we think about infotainment, for example, we love it when someone is teaching us something, but they're also funny. The better question when it comes to

Brittany Verlenich [00:21:47]:
creating your content on Instagram is, how do I want them to feel afterwards? Do you want them to be inspired?

Brittany Verlenich [00:21:47]:
Do you want them to feel empowered to do

Brittany Verlenich [00:21:52]:
something, like the information

Brittany Verlenich [00:21:52]:
that you just share with them is actually attainable and they can do it? Do you want them to feel motivated, especially in the new year, which we are now, right, as of when you're watching this, if you talk about eating right or nutrition, fitness, this is a big time of year for you. So how can you motivate your people to take action? Let's talk about how we can actually grow our traffic now that we have an idea of what Instagram is, how it works, what we're looking for, and now we've busted some myths. It all starts with compelling content, and I think we've really covered that in-depth. The hard thing is you're not going to know what's compelling to your audience until you try things out and experiment. So here, I want to assume that your content is already compelling. What do we do to make sure that that content gets the reactions you want? We do that by creating a connection to them. What I want you to do is in a minute, you're gonna pause this video. You're going to set a timer for 5 minutes so you don't get stuck in the scroll.

Brittany Verlenich [00:22:44]:
Go ahead and do that now. Set a a timer for 5 minutes. You can pause this video while you do that and then come back and push play. Did you set your timer? Okay, good. So now what you're going to do is you're going to go to Instagram yourself. And when I say go, you're going to make your timer start counting down from 5 minutes, and you're going to scroll reels on Instagram, or maybe not even reels. You can start in for you page, whatever you wanna do there or in reels, wherever you wanna focus on for your own content. And I want you to take notes.

Brittany Verlenich [00:23:09]:
What makes you stop scrolling and watch the video? What kind of hooks are they saying? And actually write them down. This is what every single good marketer and content creator does. This is what copywriters do. If we wanna get better at something, especially in the creative arts and creative industries, we need to understand what moves us. We're not the same as our readers always, but it gives us a good idea and a starting point so that you know what to create to start with. You're going to scroll on Instagram. When the timer goes off, I want you to come back and push play so we can move on. Ready? Go.

Brittany Verlenich [00:23:39]:
Did you do it? I hope so. What stood out to you? Did you write down any hooks that were interesting? This kind of work, this 5 minutes of intentional work and study and reflection on that is going to be way more compelling than any templates you buy, any video vaults you find that have, like, 50 hooks. This is the stuff that's going to work, especially because it's what's working right now. Often when we see people creating templates and things, that's what was working 6 months ago, 2 years ago, but you need to focus on what's working right now. So this is an exercise that you can do every month, every quarter, whatever your schedule allows. I want you to pay attention to how those posts made you feel. Did you feel inspired, motivated, angry? Negative feelings can work too. We see that a lot with news media, traditional media, and you might not wanna have those feelings by people who come across your content, but you might also have some polarizing opinions, controversial statements.

Brittany Verlenich [00:24:27]:
The more strongest stand you're willing to take, the more you're going to stand out, the more responses you're going to get, both positive and negative, but your post will get pushed out to more people. So that's another decision you'll have to make in how you wanna be perceived and what you want your brand to be known. Stretch. Do what you gotta do because we're gonna keep going and I wanna show you some screenshots of practical things that you can do today or this weekend to make your Instagram more actionable and so that you can get these things you want, like site traffic sales and subscribers. These are the 3 places where you can share your links. Your profile bio, which I showed you earlier, your stories, which we talked briefly about, and DMs. On stories, you do it with a link sticker, and on DMs, you can just copy and paste links into there like any other messaging platform. When we're adding a link to the story, this is the process, you're going to click on this little face box thing.

Brittany Verlenich [00:25:12]:
It might look a little bit different, by the way, if you have an iPhone. I use Android. You're going to have all these sticker options come up and you're going to click on link. You'll have this window next. You're going to paste the link into here, and then whatever text you want to pop up, you're going to tap on this customized sticker text and put that there. So when you see these link stickers that say, like, join me in Manchester, that's the text that would have come up in the customized sticker text box, and then you're going to click done once you're done. You can have up to 5 links on your Instagram profile without having any kind of third party tools. You'll wanna go to your profile, which if you click on the down arrow and click on your handle, it will take you right to it.

Brittany Verlenich [00:25:46]:
Then you'll click edit profile, which will look like this screen. You'll go to click on links, and you'll see all your links here. So you have a note that says you can add up to 5 links on your bio. You only see 4 here. However, I also have my Facebook business page linked. So if I wanted to add a separate 5th link, I could take my Facebook business page off of there. Your first link that you have up here is always going to be the one that shows on the preview of your profile. See here, I have fiverr.com/BrittanyVerlenich and 3 more.

Brittany Verlenich [00:26:12]:
So it's the same thing here. Right? You can only see those ones. But see, you can also see the link to my Facebook business page, so it's also just whatever you wanna share. You can also change the order of the links. So if you click these three little dots up here, you'll see an option that says reorder links, so you can always drag them to the position you want for them to have. And then just like with your story sticker, you'll enter the URL and then the text that you want to pop up right here. This is where the magic really starts to happen. And if you've heard of apps like ManyChat or Link DM, this is exactly what they help with.

Brittany Verlenich [00:26:40]:
They help you automate the process of sending links to people who are interested in your freebies, your products, your website, anything you have to offer. So the first thing you'll wanna start with is a compelling post. I have a screenshot here, and I have a very clear call to action. Now this specific client is a doctor with a private practice, so we have some specific disclaimers we have to include. Her content is going to look a little bit different. You don't have to have this big disclaimer at the end most likely. But she has this clear call to action, comment guide, and I'll send it to you. It's very clear people know to comment guide down below.

Brittany Verlenich [00:27:10]:
This person commented guide, I said on her behalf, just sent it over. If you used link DM or ManyChat, that whole process would be automated and you would have set all of this up in advance, including the message. Hi, person. Here's the free guide you were asking about. Link. Thank you so much. And it has the preview there of whatever you have for your website. Now I know that depending on where you are in your business, you might not be able to afford an extra $15 or $20 a month for an app or a subscription.

Brittany Verlenich [00:27:35]:
I get it because it's, like, not just 15 or 20 here. It's like 15 or 20 times 20. Right? You have so many things you're probably paying for. But you don't have to do an app or a tool to do this. You can do this manually, and I do it manually for clients. And depending on where they are in their journey, sometimes it's more affordable to have a VA or a social media manager handle it than it is to outsource this task to a tool. You just kinda have to decide where you are. I wanna say clicks are very expensive to your viewer on socials because you're interrupting their scroll time.

Brittany Verlenich [00:28:03]:
That is why you wanna make sure the post is very compelling. So in this post, it doesn't show you the reel, but the reel was talking about, and this is her words, that not all cancer is genetic. In fact, it's a very small minority that's genetic, and most of it actually comes from other factors. That's a very polarizing controversial statement that most people would not think is true. So that made for a very compelling reel that got a lot of reach very quickly. So you do wanna be thinking about that. Do you have any strong takes you can make? You always wanna give them enough information in the post itself to help them take action. The post itself should be a win.

Brittany Verlenich [00:28:33]:
Of course, we do want for them to move off the platform, but we also want their experience with the content right through on the platform to be positive. These are the different actions that people can take in the order of what I would say is most important. So, of course, we want the clicks, but these other actions signal to Instagram that the post is good and helps them push it out to more people, including shares, saves, comments, and likes. Okay. Let's talk about building your email list. The first thing you'll wanna do is make a spreadsheet of all of your core CTA codes. Whether you use many chat link DM or you just do this completely organically, you keep it separate that you know on your spreadsheet what goes to what. So for example, for that client, we use BTH for her podcast link because her podcast is called Born to Heal.

Brittany Verlenich [00:29:14]:
So anytime someone says BTH, I send them to her podcast. For her, we also have guide as her lead magnet. So anytime someone says guide, they get the guide to 3 things that you need to know about cancer that no one else is telling you. So it's a good idea for you to know what all of those are and to keep it all organized in one spreadsheet because, 1, it's going to save you time and work later, and 2, if and when you decide to hire out or maybe if you already have a team member, it's going to be easier for you to outsource it. Bear in mind that if you're using the free version of ManyChat, ManyChat does allow you to have 3 funnels. And I would think about what are those 3 core actions you want for them to take. I would recommend that you'd have at least 1 going to your freebie or your lead magnet to build your email list, one going to your website, maybe your homepage or your about page or a certain blog post that's like really core cornerstone content for you, or 3 to your signature product or service. Here's the other trick though, you can also set up saved replies up to 20.

Brittany Verlenich [00:30:07]:
And that's another reason you wanna have this spreadsheet because you wanna track them all. And also because Instagram is an app and it can sometimes be glitchy, I also recommend whatever you save in your saved replies. Also save those on separate notes within your phone, so that way you can just click on the note, open, copy, and then paste into the message. Here's how to set up your saved reply. So you're going to open up a DM with someone. I recommend trying with a friend first or if you have more than one account, use the other account. So that way you're not just sending someone random things. And you're going to click on this little icon that has 3 dots.

Brittany Verlenich [00:30:39]:
When you click on that, any saved replies you already have are going to pop up. And then once you're ready, you have one set up, you can just click on this and it will send to them. Once you have a saved reply already there, once you start typing it out, it will actually start popping up, and it's kinda hard to show you right now. But this is gonna save you a whole lot of time, especially if you find that you're saying the same things over and over again. For you travel bloggers, for example, you can have one saved reply for your itinerary about visiting Taos in New Mexico, one for Santa Fe, one for Albuquerque. Right? If you have really clear content pillars and blog posts that you're sharing over and over again, save yourself time. Then to create a new saved reply, you're going to click on this little plus. The shortcut is the word that you wanna use to bring it up.

Brittany Verlenich [00:31:19]:
So when you start typing the word also in the DM so if I was to type in guide right here, this one will start popping up, which is why it's so cool. So definitely, you wanna have your link ready. You wanna have your shortcut of what is the word that's going to come up. That's going to be the code that you have linked in the spreadsheet that you make, and then the core message that has your link in there. If you're using ManyChat, you can also set up automatic story replies so that when people are sharing your content to their stories, you're thanking them for that. She's sharing the content of this client to her stories. So I'm saying thank you for sharing. Thanks for sharing.

Brittany Verlenich [00:31:48]:
I did that manually on her behalf, but when we have many chats set up for this client, we will set that up to happen automatically. Anytime you're posting to grow your email list, you want the post itself to be a preview or something that leads to the freebie. So let me give you some examples with different niches. For my travel bloggers out there, if you have an itinerary carousel, 5 things to do in Edinburgh, Scotland, you can say as your call to action, wanna find out about my whole trip? I'll give you the itinerary in Google Docs. Comment blank to get it. If you're a food blogger and you have recipe reels where you're showing the food, send them the recipe in Google Docs or otherwise. If you're talking about tips in Canva, maybe you're a designer, you could have a template be your freebie. So this is a little bit of working backwards too.

Brittany Verlenich [00:32:29]:
We don't just want to create content and then link it to the freebie. Ideally, we have our freebie set already. So if you haven't made one, go do that and then work backwards. What kind of content would make sense with having the freebie as the next step? If you're a photographer, you could do a photo editing tutorial on a reel and then use that to sell your Lightroom presets. If you're talking about fasting, like my client was, and she says that helps to heal cancer, that readily leads to the guide about healing cancer. If you're a teacher and you have a reel showing a fun game you made for a student, the worksheet for the game could be the freebie or the product that the call to action leads to. If you are an influencer talking about fun outfits and you have a like to know it storefront or you have Amazon influencer storefront, you could have a fit check reel and then have a style guide as your freebie, or it could even just be affiliate links to a capsule wardrobe that you created. If you're a podcaster, you can show a clip of a podcast episode, maybe a recent one.

Brittany Verlenich [00:33:20]:
Maybe you have a private podcast that's your opt in or you have a podcast landing page that you want for people to go to. You want to sell the lead magnet itself like it is the best thing that person will ever see. We have to sell the free, as Faith Mariah likes to say. She's speaking here too. So if you're brand new to list building, email list building, making freebies, making lead magnets, all this stuff, you're hearing this and you're like, what is that? But you've been a blogger for a long time. One thing I highly recommend if you just need a low lift way to collect email addresses well, two things actually. One really great idea is to use a Facebook group. That way you have a private place to connect with people and you can collect all of their email addresses because you're going to set up membership questions.

Brittany Verlenich [00:34:01]:
Before they enter the group, they have to share their email address. Another really scrappy way is by setting up a Google form. This is not gonna be automated, but if you're new to list building and you're just starting with this, set up a Google form and then send it to them manually. You will not wanna do that forever. I know anyone who's an expert on email marketing heard that and just went, how could you? You do wanna have an email service provider eventually, if not already, but I'm just giving you some options if you just need to take the next step. I would rather you start collecting email addresses now. And honestly, having a Facebook group isn't a bad asset if you're a vlogger than to not have anything at all. Okay.

Brittany Verlenich [00:34:33]:
Let's talk about getting more sales on Instagram. Three things you would really wanna work on are copywriting in general, having strong hooks, and having really clear calls to action. With copywriting, I always write in 2nd person, and I always wanna speak directly to the person. And when I say speak directly, I mean directly. I am hitting their pain points, but also I'm helping them see what could be better. Right? What awaits them on the other side once they do whatever action they need to do? We wanna speak to the transformation, not just the benefits. Every post is a funnel and we're always interrupting a good time. Right? We need to show them why they should interrupt their scroll sesh and go do whatever we're asking them to do.

Brittany Verlenich [00:35:07]:
We also wanna make it super clear what we want them to do. So ideally, only one call to action per post. Don't be afraid to get repetitive, especially if you're launching a paid product or service. Most people are not going to see your post and even if they do see it more than once, it's not a big deal if they see it again. You'll also wanna start planning in advance and have a launch calendar that makes sense with all the social media content you're creating. And use the features. Like I said earlier, Instagram loves it when you use new features they have as they release them. Don't be afraid to collaborate, especially with other people in your space.

Brittany Verlenich [00:35:35]:
I know sometimes there can be this feeling of maybe their competition, but look for people who don't have the exact same offer or service as you, but who have 10 gentle ones. Those are really good collaboration partners. Track your data. Don't become too obsessed with it though. You wanna keep it light and fun so that you enjoy the journey. Here are some final tips for quick growth on Instagram. Repurpose your blog post. You don't have to start everything from scratch.

Brittany Verlenich [00:35:56]:
I am a huge fan of using chat GPT to feed your blog post and then use that to repurpose into Instagram posts. In fact, within every blog post, you probably have at least 5 to 7 post ideas for Instagram. You can also use Chat GPT for ideation if you're starting completely from scratch. I also am a big fan of scrolling for inspiration, but with a timer so you don't get stuck. And if you find that this is triggering you and it's getting you into that comparison trap, then don't do it. With that, I do think it's smart to scope out competitors, not because you wanna copy them or to get discouraged. We never wanna do that, but it is helpful to see which hooks are working, what kind of content is resonating with people. And don't be afraid to cross promote and pollinate.

Brittany Verlenich [00:36:34]:
If you have a podcast, ask them to follow you on Instagram. If you have an email list, you can have them follow you on Instagram too. Remember that when we talk about funnels, it doesn't mean that people are going to go step 1, step 2, step 3 all the time. Really, marketing is more like a web. They might hear you on a podcast and then come follow your podcast. And then maybe they'll get on your email list, but they don't buy anything right away. But then they follow you on Instagram and they see your profile bio, and that's the point where they decide to take an action. You just never know.

Brittany Verlenich [00:37:00]:
So we wanna have as many multiple touch points of people as possible. If you want help with this, there are a few different ways I can help you. 1, like I already mentioned, you can tune in to the Social Media Magic podcast. You can find that basically anywhere where podcasts are found. And I also have some of those podcasts that are specific to my YouTube channel. Here's a clip of my YouTube channel so you can get a sense of the kind of content you can find there. It's definitely a mix of informative, inspirational, and how I build this content. So I have lots of case studies on there if you wanna see people actually building things.

Brittany Verlenich [00:37:27]:
I'd also love to see you in the gram guild. This is a great next step for someone who wants to learn about Instagram and actually practice everything in a really safe supportive environment that's low pressure. This is a great place to do that. We have all kinds of challenges and I do have templates to get you started, but I don't wanna keep you there. I do not want you reliant on anybody for templates. I want you to know what you're about, what your core message is, and how to use AI and automation and tools to help you get that content out there. You can actually join the Gram Guild for just a dollar, and I'll have that information here somewhere on the page. You can use the code bb25 if for some reason the link doesn't work right away.

Brittany Verlenich [00:38:03]:
Definitely grab my Instagram bio checklist. It's going to make sure that your bio is perfectly positioned to convert people who come to your profile so that they do follow you, so that they do click on the link in your bio. You can also hire me on Fiverr. So if you're in the position where you are not wanting to do any of this stuff yourself anymore, you wanna hire it and outsource to someone who knows their stuff, I'd love to support you. But that's a one time call where we get on Zoom and work out what your strategy is going to be or a a full handoff, let's talk about it. You can hire me on Fiverr or we can work together personally to make a custom package. This is a great tip for you as well that you'll have on your profile. So let me actually show you how this works.

Brittany Verlenich [00:38:38]:
On Instagram, when you go to your profile, in the middle, there's a button that says share profile. And when you share it, you have a QR code that you can make and share. So if you have a YouTube channel, if you're presenting at summits or events like this, you can put your QR code up on the screen. And how that works is someone acts like they're going to take a picture, they go to their camera, they hold it up, and then a little link pops up on their screen. They're going to click on that, and it's going to take them right to your Instagram profile. So if you will act like you're going to take a picture now, hold it up. This should work for you so you can see how it's done in action. Thank you so much for watching my session.

Brittany Verlenich [00:39:10]:
I hope you got loads out of it. Be sure to check the screens so you can see all the offers I have for you on Fiverr, at the gram guilds, and in all the free content I have. Talk soon.
