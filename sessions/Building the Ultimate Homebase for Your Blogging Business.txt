[00:00:00.000] - Liz Stapleton, Host
All right, guys. I'm really excited to have Scrives here, Paul. He goes by Scrives, I feel like everywhere. A blog simple framework who's going to be sharing a whole new side of blogging. First of all, thank you so much for being here and for being part of this. I really appreciate it.

[00:00:15.390] - Paul Scrivens
Such a pleasure.

[00:00:16.020] - Liz Stapleton, Host
To be here. For the people that may not know you, which I find that hard to believe because I feel like you're everywhere-.

[00:00:21.780] - Paul Scrivens
Oh, you need to stop. You need.

[00:00:23.230] - Liz Stapleton, Host
To stop. Can you give people just a little on your background and what you're going to cover today?

[00:00:30.170] - Paul Scrivens
Well, I actually started blogging in 2003. And that was before people... I don't know if they even called it blogging back then or all that stuff. But essentially what happened was I graduated college. I didn't know what to do. So I got a really crappy job. And in this crappy job, I was supposed to be on the phone all the time and I don't like calling people. I'm just paranoid about it, even though that's surprising to a lot of people. And so my boss was like, Oh, we need a website. And I was like, Oh, I build websites all the time. I could build a website. I never built a website. So I didn't know what I was doing. But that was my story. And so I was like, Man, I really got to learn quickly how to build a website. So I was doing searches and actually came across some web design blogs and they were talking about how they did things. I was like, Oh, that's very interesting. And let me practice by setting up a blog. And so I set up a blog and actually started talking about web design. And that's how I was learning web design by sharing what I was learning at the same time with people.

[00:01:27.670] - Paul Scrivens
And long story short, boss found out about it, got upset, said that's not what I'm supposed to be doing, said I could either give up the blog or quit the job. So I quit the job. And then I became a full-time blogger. And I was really terrible at it for the longest time. Then I had to get a job again. And a couple of years ago, I came back into blogging. And I sat down and I tried to understand, okay, now why do some people succeed with blogging.

[00:01:51.060] - Paul Scrivens
And why do.

[00:01:51.960] - Paul Scrivens
Others just struggle? And I just kept on studying different people. And I just kept on always think it's like a coach. I just kept on trying to crack the code. And then I just kept on starting more and more blogs. And once you find what you're supposed to do, it just becomes a sick addiction. And so it's like my shoe collection behind me, it's like, I wish I could have blogs on the shelves over there and everything. So now what I do is I do have still have some other personal blogs and separate blogs, but I also help people that are just really trying to understand how do you figure out this whole blogging game and make it work for you. Yeah.

[00:02:36.220] - Liz Stapleton, Host
So I'm excited to hear what you have said. Do you want to give us just some quick highlights of what you're going to teach us?

[00:02:42.470] - Paul Scrivens
Yeah. So I think the way blogging is moving into the future is that if everybody's focused on SEO or everybody's focused on Pinterest, there's just so many people who have already started blogging or generated a blog and everybody's just like, Oh, you got to do Pinterest and you got to do SEO. And so you just have everybody competing. And I think sometimes we think that we're trying to grow our blogs in a bubble, but we're actually competing with hundreds or thousands of other bloggers that are taking the same courses, doing the same tactics and everything. So how do you create a blog that is future proof, that is not reliant on third-party services, Google, Pinterest, or something else that's not reliant on algorithms? How do you build a blog that actually focuses on building a brand that allows you to build a tribe and that tribe sticks with you for as long as you want to keep the blog open. So how do you make your blog an actual business versus just a blog where you wake up every day praying to the Google or Pinterest gods, hoping to get.

[00:03:40.170] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Some traffic. I know that's all marketing, right? So maybe you're starting there to attract your tribe, but how do you build something that your tribe is there no matter what?

[00:03:49.140] - Paul Scrivens
Right. So yeah, in essence, it's easy to get noticed, but how do you keep people's attention? And that's what we're going to be focusing on.

[00:03:59.530] - Liz Stapleton, Host
All right. I'm excited to do that. I'm going to let you take over and let's.

[00:04:03.290] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Get to it.

[00:04:03.890] - Paul Scrivens
Awesome. Thank you.

[00:04:05.670] - Paul Scrivens
All right. We're ready to dive into this. Let's talk about building a better base camp. And if you don't know what a base camp is, this is essentially what a base camp is at the bottom of a mountain and everybody sets up base camp and that's just where they begin their journey. But essentially, base camp is where you always come back home. That's the idea that I'm working with here. That's the analogy that I'm going with. Hopefully you can work with me on that if you can. Okay. Well, I don't know what to say because I just like the title, Building a Better Base Camp. Let's run with that. First and foremost, I think we need to ask an important question. What is a blog? The funny thing is I could probably ask 99 bloggers that answered to this question and I would get 178 different answers and two people would say, Hold on, let me do some SEO research on that. The reality of it is blogging is home. It's the home for your business. It's the home for your ideas. It's the home for pretty much your own creation. And I want you to keep that in mind because a lot of people tend to treat their blog as a hobby.

[00:05:20.210] - Paul Scrivens
They treat it as just a part of their website. They treat it as basically something that they can get around to every once in a while. But when you think of it as your home, it becomes different because your home should always be presentable. Your home should always feel like home. It should just always be that place that people love to come back to. Again, I want you to keep that in mind. That's going to be very, very important here. Don't worry, I'm not going to quiz you on this. Now, I want you to imagine a world without ads. I know that sounds crazy because a lot of bloggers make good money with ads. However, when I like to think about the future of blogging or how somebody can set themselves up for success with their blog, I like to think about a world without ads. And the reason why is because the ad model is already known. We already know how to make money with ads. You create a blog, you create content, and then you get a lot, a lot of traffic to it. Because you need a lot, a lot of traffic, there's just so many different dependents, so many different variables you're depending on, right?

[00:06:32.750] - Paul Scrivens
If you like to use Pinterest and you're hoping that Pinterest smiles upon you and sends you a viral pin that day. If you're working on SEO, then you're hoping that you do better than all of your competition. Essentially, when you're working with ads, you're working with a lot of things that are out of your control. So what would you do if ads did not exist at all? I think that's a good question because when you think of it like that, I think for a lot of people, it changes their strategy with regards to how they approach their blog. Now, that doesn't mean that you shouldn't have ads on your site. If you want to make money with ads, then by all means, make money with ads. But don't base your strategy around ads because what happens is if, let's say, you're ranking on the first page of Google and for this one post and this one post is basically making up 90 % of your revenue, what happens if Google changes their algorithm and that first post drops from the first position to the fifth position? It might not seem like much, but that could be hundreds of thousands or even millions of page views.

[00:07:40.060] - Paul Scrivens
That just completely crashes your revenue. What do you do? Another thing just to keep in mind, that's the whole reason why we're going through all this, is we're just imagining a world without ads. But I don't want you to think that everything that you do and learn moving forward means you can't have ads on your site. All right, makes sense. All right, so this is probably the most important question. What is the purpose of business? I know there's going to be a lot of people saying, I already know the purpose of business. The purpose of business is to help people and just do wonderful things for the world. Again, that's not the purpose of business. The purpose of business is to make money. Let's just get right to it. The purpose of business is to make money. If you're starting a blog, chances are you're starting a blog to make money. That doesn't mean that you're not doing it to help people or gain some type of fulfillment or change the world for the better, but you want to make money, and that's the purpose of business. I don't want you to be scared about saying, You know what?

[00:08:45.970] - Paul Scrivens
I'm doing this to make money. Because what happens when you make money? The more money you make, the more people you can help. And so if you're one of those people that says, I really want to change the world with my blood. I really want to help people. Well, guess what? When you make more money, you get to help more people. I mean, look at that guy. That guy is smiling because he knows he just made a deal that's going to make them more money. That's a good deal. So after you ask that question, which I just answered for you, you need to ask another question. What is the best way to make money? Now, I can tell you one of the best ways not to make money, and that's to pretend you're a happy homeless person like this guy in the picture. That is not one of the best ways to make money. So don't do that. We're more specifically wondering what's the best way to make money with your blog? And this is where people get caught up in tactics. They think, Oh, maybe ads or affiliate marketing or products or services. That's not really it.

[00:09:39.920] - Paul Scrivens
You need to think more about the strategy and not necessarily the tactics. So what is the best way to make money? Well, first and foremost, you need to send the right message and we'll go deeper into the right message. And then you need to send it to the right person. If you have a fear of clowns, I'm sorry, there was much scarier clown pictures that I could have used and this was the happy one. So again, sorry to throw that off. The right message to the right person with the right offer, that is the best way for you to make money. Because if you can send the right message to the right person with the right offer, you have a great chance of selling an affiliate product, selling your own product, selling a service. Why? Because that person's ready. It's very similar to, let's say, you're leaving a grocery store, and that's where all the Girl Scouts like to hang out and sell their cookies. It makes sense because you're shopping, you're in the mindset of food, getting ready to eat, and you bought your dinner, and there's these Girl Scouts offering you some cookies, and Thin Mints would go great with that meal you're going to prepare.

[00:10:44.340] - Paul Scrivens
So why not? But what if somebody was trying to sell you tires when you leave the grocery store? They probably wouldn't sell many tires because most people are thinking about getting tires when they're leaving the grocery store. Now, however, if there was somebody that has a flat tire in the grocery store parking lot and decide to go in and get a sandwich and is coming back out and you're selling tires, then that would be the perfect person to sell to. But the chances of that happening are slim. So you really don't want to go down that road. So again, the right message to the right person with the right offer is the best way to make money. And if we're being honest, this is where most blogs collapse. And I say that because we're not necessarily taught as bloggers how we should approach our whole blog strategy. A lot of us are taught that we should just go and just find all the popular content or the best content that people want to read and then we just write that content. And so each individual piece of content just does its own thing. And eventually what happens after a couple of months or a couple of years, we have this blog that is just a paint splatter of a bunch of different topics and blog posts.

[00:12:01.270] - Paul Scrivens
There's just no cohesion to it. And the reality of it is every piece of content that you create must have a purpose. It must have a purpose. So basically every single thing that you do with regards to content creation, be it blog post, YouTube videos, social media posts, it all has to have a purpose. And so if you're wondering, well, what is that purpose? That's an excellent question, and that's why you're my favorite student. No matter how many people watching this, you're my favorite student. Just keep that in mind. So what is the purpose? Well, before we can understand the purpose of each piece of content, we need to start with a goal. You might be thinking, Well, the goal is to make money because that's what you said. The goal is to make money with the business. And you caught me on that one. But unfortunately, that is not the goal we're thinking of. We're not thinking of the goal for you. We're thinking of the goal for your reader. And this is important because without the reader, if we're being honest, there is no money. And I'm sure you figured that out, right?

[00:13:13.240] - Paul Scrivens
There's no audience, there is no money. So we need to figure out a goal for the reader. Because if you can figure out a goal for the reader, then everything else starts to fall in place. So how do you figure that out? You're going to ask a simple question. Who do they want to become? Now you might be thinking, Well, wait, that's not really simple at all. What do you mean, who do they want to become? Well, if you think about it, whenever we do a search on Google or YouTube or Pinterest, we're searching for maybe a solution. If we're going through social media and we're liking posts, then maybe we're liking posts because we aspire for something. No matter what, we want to become something. We want to become someone else than who we currently are. I don't want you to think extreme. I don't think suddenly that I wish I was a member of parliament in England. It's not like that. But a simple example would be when you're hungry, you want to become someone who's not hungry. It's small things like that. When your teeth feel yucky, you want to be someone who feels like their teeth aren't yucky, so you go brush your teeth.

[00:14:27.510] - Paul Scrivens
It could be very simple to think like things like that. It could be very complex things. It could be someone who wants to become someone that's going to have your marriage that has a better job. It can be very small things or can be very large things. But you need to figure out who does your reader want to become. You have to be careful here because this is where a lot of people get caught up and they come up with very vague things. My reader wants a happier life. The more specific you can get, the better. For example, let's say someone wants to gain a bigger audience with something. Let's say a person wants to gain a bigger audience for their blog, they want to be someone who has a larger following for their blog. They realize that maybe YouTube is a good place to go. That can be a thing. They want to be a person who has a thousand subscribers on YouTube. Okay, so that's very specific, right? That's very specific and something we can figure out. So after you figure out who they want to become, you need to figure out the steps.

[00:15:30.610] - Paul Scrivens
And what I mean is you need to map out all the different things that someone must know to achieve that person they want to become. And this is going to be totally dependent on the size of the goal. If the goal is massive, like I want to be an astronaut, then obviously you're going to have a ridiculous amount of steps. But if the goal is you just don't want your teeth to feel yucky anymore, then maybe the steps are go buy some toothpaste and toothbrush, go home, brush your teeth. Even then, we can break that down. What's the best toothpaste? What's the best toothbrush? What's the best technique for brushing your teeth? Let me show you how to brush your teeth. Should you floss? Almost anything that we can come up with with regards to the goal, we can break it down into steps. As you'll see in a little bit, I don't want to spoil this for you, but as we'll see in a little bit, each of those steps can become a piece of content. Now hopefully you're starting to see the structure that you're forming with your blog. Instead of just having a blog with random blog posts all over the place, you're starting to have a little bit of structure here.

[00:16:40.270] - Paul Scrivens
Now that you understand the steps, and you might not have all the steps written down, you might not understand all the things that a person immediately needs to do to become this new person that they want to become. But over time, you'll begin to figure it out, either through interactions with people, through comments, through emails. This is something that is not supposed to be where you figure out the steps and then that's it. You figure out the steps that you know right now and then maybe you figure out some more steps six months later. So now what? Now what do you do? Do you create tons of content? It's very possible. That's what a lot of bloggers tend to do, right? They just say, Hey, it's time for me to create a ton of content and I am going to write 100 blog posts in the next three months. And that's what I'm going to do. I'll just start creating content. Before you do that, you need to become aware of something. What is it that you need to become aware of? Well, you need to become aware of the five stages of awareness. I know you're wondering, What are you talking about?

[00:17:47.800] - Paul Scrivens
What are these five stages of awareness? Well, if we go all the way back in time, we answer the question, What is the best way to make money? The best way to make money is to send the right message to the right person with the right offer. However, people aren't always ready for that offer. Let me brought up the grocery store analogy, but we have another analogy that we're working with now, and that is the person wants 1,000 subscribers on YouTube. Now, that goal was very specific in the sense that this person knew that they wanted 1,000 subscribers. What about the person that just is thinking about growing their blog? They're not they're not even... They don't really know YouTube is an option for them growing their blog. They're at a different stage of awareness, right? There's a person who totally understands that YouTube can help them and they want to dive deeper into it, and then there's a person who doesn't even know YouTube is an option for them. That's what we're talking about with the five stages of awareness. You have most aware, which is the person who just knows, Okay, I know YouTube is going to help me.

[00:18:55.340] - Paul Scrivens
I've got my channel set up. I know all this stuff. I need to figure out how to get my first out on the subscribers. It goes all the way down to the completely unaware person who doesn't even know YouTube is an option. There's a difference. Then you have all these stages in the middle. You have product aware where they understand that there is a product out there that will help them and they're actually looking at the product. You have solution aware where they understand it's a solution. They just don't know which solution to pick. Problem Aware is when they realize, Oh, okay, I actually do have a problem that I want to fix. So if we're looking at this with a YouTube person, getting completely unaware, they don't really know YouTube is an option. Problem Aware is, Oh, now they know YouTube is an option, but they don't know what they're supposed to do with YouTube. Solution Aware is, Oh, now they see that there is possibility to grow to a thousand subscribers and get big, product-aware would be maybe they now find a course or both teaching them how to get to a thousand subscribers.

[00:19:55.010] - Paul Scrivens
Most aware is now they're completely aware of the product, the solutions, and all of the problems, and they're ready to make a decision and move forward with stuff. So what does this have to do with content? Well, believe it or not, every piece of content you create is directed towards a stage of awareness. Whether you knew a stage of awareness was being targeted by a piece of content or not, it doesn't matter. Every piece of content that you create is directed towards a stage of awareness. And this is where when you understand this concept as a blogger, the game completely changes. The reason why it changes because when you understand the content, when you understand who that content is specifically targeting, you understand the map. The map is the way you get back to your base camp. What exactly do I mean by this? Well, let's look at some examples here. We're sticking with this getting your first thousand subscribers on YouTube thing. Let's say you decide I'm going to write a post. The ultimate guide to getting your first thousand subscribers on YouTube. I love ultimate guides. Ultimately guides are a great start for anything.

[00:21:06.020] - Paul Scrivens
Now, a lot of people, what they would do is they would just leave it at that. I've created the ultimate guide to getting your first subscribers on YouTube. So that's it. I don't need to do anything else. However, remember the person who doesn't even know that YouTube is a solution for them. They're scrolling through Facebook, Instagram, Pinterest, whatever, and they see the ultimate guide to getting your first thousand subscribers on YouTube. And what do they do? They just go right past it. Why? Because they're not even aware that YouTube is an option for them. What could I do for that person? Looking through this content, I don't have a specific post for that person. A post for that person could be 17 ways to grow your blog's audience. Now, that person knows that they want to grow their blog audience. As they're going through that post, you see number 13, use YouTube. Now they're becoming aware. Wow. I can actually use YouTube to help grow my blog audience. Okay. This is starting to make sense here. Starting to make sense. I'm starting to piece things together here. But we also have other pieces of content that go towards the different stages.

[00:22:23.070] - Paul Scrivens
The idea here is when we say, when you understand the content, you understand the map, think if you can attach a stage of awareness to each of these pieces of content. And the idea is you want to move them from five to one, right? You want to move them up the ladder, so to speak. If you could attach a stage of awareness to each of these pieces of content, then you can start building out a map or a guide. You can figure out which post is a link to where. Instead of just randomly saying, Well, you know what? I want to rank for this keyword, so I'm going to have this post linked to this other post. Instead, you can say, You know what? Now that this person has read my 17 ways to build your blog's audience and now they're interested in YouTube, now maybe I can send them to the ultimate guide to get your first thousand subscribers on YouTube. And that post suddenly links to the top five cameras for people getting started with YouTube, which then links to my YouTube channel on creating a video, creating your first video for YouTube.

[00:23:27.360] - Paul Scrivens
And then when you create your first video, you want to edit it. So then that links to my post on the best software to use to edit your videos. And while you're editing your videos, you want to add music, so you need to find the best places for copyright-free music. And now that you've done your first video, you want to figure out some other video ideas, so then that links to a post on creating video ideas. Now that you have your basic setup, maybe you want to see a more advanced setup. I'll talk about it on my Instagram story about my own video setup. Now you're getting sick of me talking about my stuff and you want to learn from somebody else. Then I have a Facebook Live interview with another YouTube creator where she explains how she got started with YouTube, which those posts, which that Facebook Live can link back to my site with some other posts. Then I decided, Hey, you know what? I want to send out a series of tweets with all short tips on succeeding with YouTube and all those tips linked back to the different posts that I've created on my site because now I have a map and this map is leading them all the way up to the stages of awareness.

[00:24:27.040] - Paul Scrivens
Now, notice if you're looking at this list, this is not just posts on your site. It's actually social media posts, your own posts on your site, and everything just leads back to that single goal. And again, the goal we set up for this person is how to get your first thousand subscribers on YouTube. Now, the beauty of following this method, which I call the content buffet, is that over time you're going to have multiple goals. But first you just need to start with the what. You need to start with that one goal. What do you want your reader to become? I want my reader to become someone who can get their first thousand subscribers on YouTube. Now, once they do that, what do I want them to do? Maybe I say I want them to make their first thousand dollars from affiliate marketing in YouTube. So then that becomes a whole new set of posts and social media and all that stuff. And then from there, what do I want them to do? Well, then I want them to get to a million subscribers. And you might be wondering, where emails or products or services fit in here?

[00:25:36.280] - Paul Scrivens
Hopefully you can see this all comes together. Because it's not that I have to say these things once, I'm going to say these things over and over again. I can have an email series that also talks about fighting copyright-free music and then making sure that you understand the best type of music to use for your video. I can have a whole course on setting up your YouTube channel and using YouTube SEO to rank better with your videos. And this is all going to work. Why? Because I understand now that I have to send the right message to the right person with the right offer. It's not just me creating random content for my site, hoping that each individual piece of content gets X amount of traffic, so I can make a little bit of money. Every piece of content that I've created here serves a purpose, and maybe business-wise, that purpose is leading them to my YouTube course. But it doesn't make sense for me to write the blog post on the 14 ways to grow your blog's audience. And in that post, I say, You know what? You can use YouTube to grow your audience.

[00:26:51.880] - Paul Scrivens
If you want to use YouTube, go buy my course. Because that person had just entered the fourth stage. They just became problem aware. They're not at product aware or most aware. And so that's why I want to link them to my other pieces of content. That's why no matter where they come across me, either on the blog, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Pinterest, YouTube, whatever channels I decide to use, everything is just driving home that message. Hey, I'm going to help you get your first thousand subscribers on YouTube. I'm going to help you build a successful YouTube channel. Everything comes back to your base camp. That's why I like to call the blog the base camp. When I said your blog is your home, think about it. When people into your home and they go, Where's the bathroom? Most homes follow a logical layout, right? You don't go, Where's the bathroom? Oh, it's in the basement. Just go down the hall, take a left. Okay. That's how you need to set up your site. How can you set up your site where the map becomes clear? Instead of your homepage just being a big generic screen with a list of blog post, maybe it becomes a map of its own.

[00:28:18.110] - Paul Scrivens
Maybe you tell the people, Hey, you want to build a successful YouTube channel? Follow these lists of posts in order. And so the content buffet, people should be able to go to your site, jump in and out, pull the pieces of content that they want at that time. But it all follows the same theme. Sometimes you go to the buffet, you might say, You know what? Let me get some chicken wings this time. Well, guess what? I have a nice little email series on something with YouTube. They go sit down and they consume that. They're like, All right, I'm ready for some more. Oh, guess what? The Prime rib is ready. So you go to get the Prime rib. Prime rib happens to be a nice big blog post on something else with YouTube. When you follow this model with your blog, it gives your blog more structure. So there are benefits to this. There are huge benefits when you follow this model because now your blog has a structure, it gives you authority. Because if somebody comes to your site and they're like, Holy crap, this blog has all the information I need about this one person that I want to become, you build authority.

[00:29:40.350] - Paul Scrivens
And when you build authority, you build trust. Because you have that trust and it makes it easier to get people to buy things. It also builds expertise. You become known. People say, Oh, you're interested in building a YouTube channel, getting your first down subscribers? Go check out Paul. There's a whole site around that stuff. Now, you might be concerned like, Oh, I really don't want a niche site. I don't want my site to be one particular thing. Remember, you could expand. But you need to start with one thing. You need to start with one goal because you're going to find that you have that one goal. It becomes a lot easier to map everything else. Now, you might be asking a question. This question might be just ringing in your ears. The question is, But what about my ads? You said I didn't have to get rid of my ads. Notice that I didn't take away ads from this. You can still write your 99 ketogenic dinners made with chocolate, right? You can still write posts like that that have a chance of pulling in big stuff. You can still write the post that target specific SEO keywords.

This model is not taking anything away from that. What it's doing is it's giving the overall blog a structure. It's making sure that each piece of content plays a specific role and makes sure that everything is cohesive. The actual steps, what do you need to do? You need to figure out the goal. Now, again, over time, you're going to have multiple goals as your blog expands. Or maybe you just have the one goal and it takes you for 5, 10 years to write everything to accomplish that one goal, or you just keep on expanding that goal. You need to map out the steps. This is also a great way to figure out your content. I know a lot of bloggers sit there and I just don't know what to write about. Well, figure out the goal, map out the steps, and then that's the content that you need to create. And then you need to make sure that each piece of content that you do create has a job. And what I mean by this is every piece of content should have a call to action. And that doesn't necessarily mean that every piece of content needs to get the reader to sign up for it, that's your mailing list, right?

[00:32:01.040] - Paul Scrivens
Because what if somebody's completely unaware? Do they want to sign up for your email course on how to pick the perfect in credit post titles card for a YouTube video? Probably not because they don't know what that means. So maybe your big call to action is licking them to another post, which will move them up the content awareness ladder. And then in that post, maybe you have a very specific opt-in that works for their level of awareness. When you understand the levels of awareness for each piece of content, you can tailor more specific calls to action, which increases the conversion rate of those calls to action, which gets you the right people. And when you have the right people, you already know you're sending them the right message. And when you're sending them the right message, you can send them to the right offer. And now you're making more money with your blog. Now you're getting more traffic with your blog. Now your blog is becoming more known. Everything just works out better. When you start following this content buffet and you're creating and building a better base camp. There's a lot to digest with all this.

[00:33:10.950] - Paul Scrivens
There's a whole lot you can run with on this and it's just an exciting way to go about blogging because it feels like it gives your blog a purpose. It feels like when somebody shows up for your blog, they're not just showing up and randomly wondering, What do I do now? Your blog gives them all the tools that they need. That's just a good feeling to have. All right, thank you. That's not a stock photo, that's actually me. The clown picture was better, but I like that one. Thank you, everybody. Hopefully, I didn't put you to sleep. And yeah, if you ever have any questions, just reach out.

Thank you so much for sharing all that valuable information. I love the aspect of not just getting attention, but getting people to stay there. So thank you for sharing that. Any final words before we tell everyone about the free thing you've got for them?

[00:34:12.700] - Paul Scrivens
I know blogging can be frustrating, depending on who you're looking at, because it always seems like there's one person who's like, I'm doing so great with my blog today. And then you're sitting there thinking, That's not fair. My blog is not doing well at all. But for every one person, there's thousands of us who are still going through that struggle. And really, the name of the game is just persistence. And I don't mean persistence like you keep on banging your head against the wall. But every once in a while, take a step back, look, see what adjustments you can make, test things, and keep on pushing.

[00:34:43.450] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Yeah. And I'm sure after the summit, you'll have a ton of ideas. So take a deep breath, maybe write them all out. And then just write.
