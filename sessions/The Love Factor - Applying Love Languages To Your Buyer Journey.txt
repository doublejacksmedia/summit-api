Hey there. Welcome to "The Love Factor: Applying Love Languages to Your Buyer Journey." Over the session, we'll explore a few different things. The first is busting some common buyer journey myths. The second is we're going to focus in on why your buyer journey matters, and how it could positively impact your business and your future sales. Then we're going to touch on the five love languages and then some examples of each of them in business. Also, we're going to wrap it up with when and how to actively and strategically apply love languages to your buyer journey.

[00:00:48.120] - Stacy
But first, let me introduce myself super quickly. I'm Stacy Coyle of "Workplace Lemonade," and I'm a purveyor of customer journey and buyer experience glow-ups, which is basically just a fancy way of saying that I am a customer journey and buyer experience strategist. So, I help digital business owners experiencing growth, realign their customer journey. And when I say realign, what I mean is does your current customer journey match both your audience's needs and your goals as a business? If those are not aligned, then your customer journey is going to really struggle to do its job. And then because the customer journey does not end at the point of sale, I also help digital business owners craft high-end experiences that wow their audience.

[00:01:34.200] - Stacy
So yes, that includes the buyer journey too. I've added a few things that I'm into at the moment. I'm calling these trends, but I guess the first one is less of a trend and more of just a state of being for me. I'm originally from Ireland, but I thought I'd mention it here in case you are wondering about my accent. I am putting you out of your suspense. I've really gotten into Dungeons and Dragons of late, and I'm currently playing a High Elf Warlock, or at least I hope I still am at the time you're watching this. And I really love binging K-Dramas. Korean dramas are just amazingly addictive. And then the last one, I guess, is less of a trend again and more of a lifelong aspiration in that I would like to be a cat lady. But I travel a lot at the moment, so it's not a good fit. But anyway, enough about me. Let's dive into the session.

[00:02:26.080] - Stacy
Let me clarify what I mean by buyer journey. So a buyer journey is anything that happens to your buyer once they hit the checkout button. Anything that they experience beyond that. Those are things like the Thank You page, maybe a welcome video, the welcome email, any email that they get in regards to any touchpoints about the product or service, like module drops or reminders for live elements, things like testimonial requests or feedback requests would also be included in the buyer journey.

[00:02:59.330] - Stacy
I want us to bust a couple of myths about the buyer journey. The first one I mentioned earlier, but I really want to reiterate it. Often when we think of our customer journey, it can feel like the point of purchase is like the ultimate finish line, that all paths in our business lead there. That's really not the case. Our customer journey continues beyond the point of sale. And how we craft our buyer's journey can have a huge impact on our business.

[00:03:28.130] - Stacy
Another common myth is that the customer journey is linear. So, think of like someone sees us, they opt into something, we then spend some time nurturing them, they see a checkout page, a purchase, and then we deliver the thing to them. So that linear path. But in reality, often our customer journey is way more flexible than that. People can hop in and out at different stages. People cycle through the same stage multiple times. So you can have someone who fast-tracks straight to a buyer just from seeing an Instagram post, for example. Or you could have a buyer who goes back into the nurture phase and then a few months or a year later, repurchases something else from you.

[00:04:10.410] - Stacy
So people can move through your customer journey in different ways. They could also move through it cyclically as well. There are just so many possibilities. So it's worth keeping that flexibility in mind when we are planning our customer journey and our buyer journey too because the buyer journey and the customer journey is a part of the same thing, but because of the checkouts, we can think of them as two different things. But our customer journey extends beyond that point of purchase, so the buyer journey is really part of the customer journey.

[00:04:39.750] - Stacy
Let's explore why it's worth spending time strategically planning that buyer experience. The first one is achieving your vision. When we're creating a product or service, we always have in mind like, oh people are going to really love this, or this is going to be so useful, or we're really excited to see how people interact with the product or service. Taking the time to plan your buyer journey and stepping into the role of being a good guide. By good guide, what I mean is how can we proactively anticipate our buyer's needs? But by doing that, we allow our offer and ourselves to shine. We want people to be able to interact with our product or service in the way that we envisioned.

[00:05:22.550] - Stacy
Then we want our product or service, our buyer journey, to reflect what was promised pre-sale. We don't want to be accidentally catfishing anyone. By focusing in on our buyer journey, we can help our buyers feel super supported, build that connection between us and them. In turn, that increases buyer participation and buyer engagement as well, which is all part of the vision that we would have had for that digital product or service.

[00:05:52.040] - Stacy
The second reason is future sales. The data tells us that the people most likely to buy from us are those that have an existing relationship with us. And yet we often spend a lot of our time and effort focusing on how we can find new leads. And I'm not saying that we shouldn't focus on how to find new leads. Of course, we should. Well, what I am saying is that we can spend some of that energy into nurturing our relationships with our current buyers. And by focusing on the buyer journey, it helps us to do that.

[00:06:21.000] - Stacy
And the benefits of doing so are that we can increase repeat sales from our buyers, but also we can increase referrals because people who've really enjoyed the experience of working with us are way more likely to become affiliates, give us testimonials. When people are looking for a specific expert or someone who does X thing, your name is more likely to pop up in the conversation if they have positive associations with you. So it is way more effective to spend some time on your buyer journey, continue to nurture those relationships that we have with our buyers, and long term, we will see the effects of that in our business.

[00:06:59.400] - Stacy
Then the third reason that I have here today is that it will boost your confidence, both the confidence that you have as an expert who's visible, and then also your team's confidence in delivering the program or product. So planning your buyer journey ahead of time helps you run your program or product as a well-oiled machine. It helps you field less questions. You'll get less refund requests, primarily because the experience post-purchase is matching that pre-purchase experience, like the catfishing element we touched on earlier. And you as the expert can spend less time worrying about who got access to what, and focus more on delivering your expertise. And this allows you and your team to focus on providing an excellent experience instead of worrying about the logistics.

[00:07:46.590] - Stacy
So, out of these three, which would you be most excited to achieve in your own business? Achieving the vision, increasing future sales, or building that confidence?

[00:07:57.130] - Stacy
All right, so now that I've spent some time on my soapbox talking about buyer journeys and customer experiences, let's move on to love languages.

[00:08:06.360] - Stacy
So before we dive in, I want to mention that people give and receive love differently. What I personally love is not necessarily what everyone loves. So sometimes we have to factor in other people's love languages when we're considering them. Our natural inclination does not necessarily match the person that we're planning to give some love to.

[00:08:28.270] - Stacy
The other thing I want to mention is that emotion is important. If your buyer doesn't feel anything as they navigate your buyer journey, they're less likely to engage, refer you, repeat buy in future. We want them to feel something, and what we want them to feel is excited, impressed, supported, all the good things. Then this comes back to point one again, but understanding your buyer's love languages can help you roll out to the red carpet. We want to understand what helps them feel supported, what helps them feel appreciated. That comes back to the idea that what we naturally think of as our preferred love language may not actually be theirs. It's worth investing time and effort into figuring out what's really resonating with your buyers.

[00:09:16.560] - Stacy
Why do we actually want to add love languages to the mix? What are the benefits of actually spending time actively thinking on this? The first one is Empathy. We want to step into our buyer's shoes and anticipate their needs at once. We want to do this anyway when crafting a buyer journey, but when we view it through the lens of love languages, it really helps us get into their shoes and anticipate their needs, what would make them feel good?

[00:09:42.260] - Stacy
The next one is Appreciation. We want to convey our appreciation to our buyers. They have just invested in us. We want to make sure that they feel appreciated and that they feel supported.

[00:09:52.860] - Stacy
The next one is Reputation. Love languages mix with a solid buyer journey, has that "wow factor" and it reinforces your position as an expert.

[00:10:03.510] - Stacy
Then the last one, and it's not to be cynical, but there is an element of Reciprocity. That is often returned to us by things like testimonials, referrals, or maybe even repeat purchases.

[00:10:16.350] - Stacy
It is worth our time to consider how we can use the tool of love languages to achieve these things. I keep saying love languages, but we haven't touched on what those are. Here are the five love languages. We have Gifting, Words of Affirmation, Quality Time, Acts of Service, and Touch. Do you know which of the five is your love language? It's not that we do not appreciate every love language, it's just attends that we have a preference, like a scale of 1-5. Do you know which one is your favorite and which one is your least favorite? If you're not sure, let's dive into each of these love languages and come up with some examples of how we can use them in our business and our buyer journey.

[00:11:01.470] - Stacy
All right, so first up we have Gifting, and the reason I put this first is because I think this is the one that most naturally comes to mind. So for the receiver, a gift is a visual symbol of your regard. They value the time, effort, and thought that goes into selecting a gift for them. So receiving a thoughtful gift will stand out in their memory vividly. And then for the giver, you want to plan your gift thoughtfully. What would the receiver specifically like to receive? Let's touch on how we can add gifting into our business. The first thing I want to say is that gifting is very much on a scale. There has got to be some balance between what you choose to gift and then the cost of the program or service. It has to be sustainable. It can't be financially to your detriment.

[00:11:47.690] - Stacy
Having said that, gifts don't have to be expensive and you can actually give gifts, like relatively cheap things as well. Some example of gifts in business, and I think it comes into three categories. The first is high-end gifting, the second is universal gifting, and the third is little knickknacks. So the first one, Tier One, that would be used in high-end coaching programs or one-on-one services. You want to convey appreciation that someone has invested a significant amount of money in you and your business. So, when it comes to those tier-one gifts, those really should be designed for the receiver in mind. They should be specific to that receiver, and thought and care put into, "What would that person specifically like to receive?"

[00:12:33.570] - Stacy
Now, of course, it can be a little bit tricky to figure those things out. So when we're planning our buyer journey, we should probably add things into the mix to help us figure that stuff out. Usually when we're gifting, we want it to be a surprise. So it's a bit anticlimactic to be like, "Hey, what do you like or dislike?" But there are little signs along the way, whether on their social media, whether on their onboarding call, whether on their intake form, etc, that can give us an idea as to what they would or would not appreciate as a gift.

[00:13:02.290] - Stacy
Tier Two is universal gifting, and this is usually a best fit for a program that has a largest cohort. There are too many people in the cohort to sustainably pick out a gift for each person. However, you do want to convey your appreciation. The thing I would say when it comes to gifting on this level is it should have universal appeal. It should match the vibes of your program, or you, or your brand, because that's more likely to be in alignment with what they would expect and, what they would appreciate. The final thing I will say about universal gifting is you should take into account things like allergies, whether that's through food, perfumes, or anything like that. People can be very sensitive to foods and perfumes and things. So when you are sending out a universal gift to everyone, take into account that you don't want to accidentally give someone something that they won't be able to eat or consume.

[00:13:56.730] - Stacy
Then Tier Three, which is knickknacks, that's things like little journals, pencils, pens, stickers, little things. Those are for random little appreciation. You can have a lot of fun with those. Those could be really branded to your business or things like, for example, my brand is "Workplace Lemonade." I think if I were sending out stickers and stuff, they'd probably be little lemonade bottles or yellow in general. Those little gifts would just be like specific things that are just fun, little elements of joy. It doesn't have to be hyper-specific to the receiver, but just spark a little joy upon receipt.

[00:14:35.750] - Stacy
The only thing I will say about gifting is we do think about it as a physical thing, but you can gift digitally as well. Whether that's from your own product suites or whether that's like vouchers, etc, you can do that too. You can give people access to digital products or maybe credit to your business, etc. However, for whatever reason, digital gifting just feels less personal than physical gifting. If you're aiming for that personalization, then physical gifting tends to be the better way to go.

[00:15:07.000] - Stacy
Okay, so up next we have Words of Affirmation. So, for the receiver, they enjoy kind words and encouragement. They like random messages. They appreciate being top of mind. You as a giver you can make this person's day just by complimenting them or popping in to cheer them on. So verbal or written words of encouragement or positivity, are really impactful for this type of person. So when we're using words of affirmation, there are so many different ways we can go about that. We can just pop into someone's DM's and just send them a little note. We can send them a personalized video. You can hit reply to their newsletter email, or you can send an organic email where you're just like, "Hey, I was thinking of you, blah, blah, blah." During a one-on-one call together, you can touch on things you saw them doing and that you thought were really cool. You could comment on their social media content. One, it helps drive engagement for them, but two, they're always going to appreciate the kind words. Or if they're in your group program, noting their achievements during a group call can be a way of giving them those affirming words.

[00:16:12.830] - Stacy
Now, I will say do take into account the type of person someone is. If they're more low-key or introverted, maybe those public shout-outs might not feel super comfortable to them. But, if someone is very visible publicly and loves engaging and sharing the wonderful things other people do, then yeah, pop in and do that more visibly.

[00:16:33.930] - Stacy
So, up next is Quality Time. So the receiver wants undivided attention. They appreciate when you are present and focused on them when you're together. And then for you as the giver, you want to prioritize being present, attentive, mindful. You want to make the person that you're with feel like they are your full priority, and that you are actively listening to what they are saying. So basically, for the person who loves quality time, they just want your undivided attention and they want open communication. So, in order for someone to feel like they have that, you want to first actively listen. Secondly, you want to remember the things they said. And thirdly, you want to follow up on those things at some other point. So if I mentioned something in passing weeks ago and then you bring it up later, they're like, oh my gosh, you remember that, and I'm going to feel super appreciated. So when you're on one-on-one calls or DM'ing or on a coffee date, whatever your avenues of connection are, if you're referencing those things that they've said in the past, if you're actively listening and engaging with what they are saying and they can tell they really have your attention, then they're going to feel super appreciated.

[00:17:41.240] - Stacy
The next one is Acts of Service. So, if your buyer's main love language is acts of service, they'll notice and appreciate the little extra things you do for them. Basically, they'll notice those extra mile things. And then as the giver, actions speak louder than words. So think of ways that you could support and care for your buyer. So in terms of how that can work in business, we could introduce them to a peer that we think that they would gel really well with, or maybe we could highlight them in a newsletter email or show and tell, or if your buyers work maybe reshare some of their social media posts, or refer them as a potential fit.

[00:18:18.820] - Stacy
Some of those things crossover with the idea of Words of Affirmation, of course. There is a little bit of wiggle room there. But other ways we can be of service is when we spend a little bit extra time doing something, reviewing something, giving them feedback, etc, when we're thoughtful about things like that. Those are Acts of Service and things that people who really appreciate that that extra mile will really appreciate.

[00:18:43.660] - Stacy
Finally, we have Touch. And all I'm going to say about touch is that if you're a digital business, then it's probably best to ignore this love language for now and focus your energy on the other four. So, now that we've been through all the love languages, do you know which is your love language?

[00:18:59.900] - Stacy
Now let's move on to how we can actually add love languages into our buyer journey. There's a couple of things to remember. The first is that your love language may not be the same as your buyers. We have to consider that what we naturally gravitate towards may not be what our buyers actually appreciate. You might love gifting, but maybe your buyers just really want quality time with you. It is worth remembering what you instinctively gravitate towards may not match your buyers.

[00:19:29.300] - Stacy
The second thing is it's okay to lean into your own love language to make it more sustainable long term. Using love languages in your buyer journey should feel sustainable. The easiest place to start when it comes to love languages is what comes naturally to you. It's also worth remembering that even when you're not actively planning on using love languages, they do have a habit of finding their way in there anyway. You will subconsciously add them into the mix.

[00:19:57.530] - Stacy
Then the third thing is that any use of love languages in your buyer journey should be an enhancement, not added just because. It's important to have a solid buyer journey in place before you actively add in any bells or whistles. There is really no point in spending time on sending your buyers gifts and being really attentive if the rest of the experience is super chaotic. So your love languages can't really compensate for a poor or chaotic buyer experience. So, you've got to make sure that you have the foundations in place and then sprinkle the love languages in as a way of adding more to it.

[00:20:36.730] - Stacy
So, when do we add love languages into the mix? So, earlier we spoke about the importance of planning your buyer journey, and here's a hot tip. Most buyer experiences are actually pretty mediocre. So just by having a buyer journey that's been thoughtfully planned with your buyers in mind, that's already going to set you apart. So, that being said, we want to know when we can add love languages into the mix.

[00:21:01.110] - Stacy
I would say add love languages into the mix once you have a solid buyer journey in place, one that you've thoughtfully thought out. I also just want to remind you that even if you're not actively adding love languages into your buyer journey just yet, some of those organically find their way in. So, it's not like we're not making use of them at all.

[00:21:23.450] - Stacy
So, when you are adding love languages into your buyer journey, you want to start by adding one love language at a time, just to make it sustainable. So choose one that's sustainable to you, that's balanced with the price point of your program or offer, and start with one product or service and see what the response or the workload feels like before branching out.

[00:21:45.760] - Stacy
Now that we're nearing the end of the session, let's just cast our eyes back a little bit and think about the things that we should take a look at if we want to add love languages into our buyer experience. My recommendation is that going forward, that you review your buyer journey to make sure it's as strategic as possible and that the foundations are in place. Like I said, most buyer journeys are pretty mediocre, so just by having a solid foundation in place, you're really going to stand out.

[00:22:14.260] - Stacy
Then do a self-assessment, a self-check. What are your own love languages? What do you naturally gravitate towards? Then take notes of the things that you notice that your buyers appreciate, because there may be a difference between what you naturally gravitate towards and what your buyers super-appreciate. You want to find a balance between those two things to make sure that it's sustainable long-term and that it comes semi-intuitively to you. And then you want to start trialing by actively adding one love language into the buyer journey of one product or service.

[00:22:45.740] - Stacy
And then once you've figured out okay, what's the response been like? How did this feel? Did this add anything or was this superfluous? Did people really love it or were they meh on it? Did I find it hard to deliver? Or was this really energizing? Then you could start branching out from there.

[00:23:05.300] - Stacy
And if you've been wondering how you can strategically plan your buyer journey, then I invite you to come check out your "Customer Journey Pillars and Roadmap." This is a short PDF and it goes through a couple of different things to consider when planning your buyer journey. The first is the three foundational pillars for impactful customer experiences. The second is an neglected high-impact area that you can use to increase future sales. Then the third is the five-step program delivery roadmap for smoother-than-butter delivery. So if you use this PDF, you should walk away with some insights into how you can plan your buyer journey. You can download that on workplacelemonade.com/pillars-roadmap.

[00:23:50.980] - Stacy
