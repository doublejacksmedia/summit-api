All right, guys. I am super excited to have this speaker come back. She is the first princess of email marketing. Liz Wilcox is an email strategist and keynote speaker, showing small businesses how to build online relationships and make real money with emails. She's best known for selling a blog, turning a $9 offer into multiple six figures without ads, and helping you untangle the email knot with her simple framework, this email staircase. She loves the '90s, headbands, and the beach. A big, super warm welcome to Liz Wilcox. Coming back, thank you so much for joining us again.

[00:00:41.940] - Liz Wilcox
Hey, friends. I'm so excited. Let's do this thing.

[00:00:47.170] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Yeah. So we're talking about once you've started growing your audience, what's next, right? So let's dive into how can they, once they start growing that audience, start to nurture a deeper connection with that audience.

[00:01:03.370] - Liz Wilcox
Yeah. So I teach something called the email staircase. First, you've got a follower. We get them on the list. We've got some friends. And then once you have a list full of friends, you can have a list full of customers. So a your friend customer. And really, that's just a fancy way of explaining the customer journey, right? That can feel really, I don't know, like a knot you're never going to be able to untangle. Well, we just untangled it. Three easy steps. So if we want that list full of customers one day, we really have to nurture our subscribers. I say, just make friends in the inbox. And how the heck do you make a friend in the inbox? You just got to do three things. Number one, show that you are invested in your readers. And this can be as simple as if you have a podcast saying, I just bought a new podcast, Mic, so I don't sound like garbage. That shows you're invested in that community, in your readers. It could also be something like, I just attended this event where I'm going to learn all about emails and writing better emails for you.

[00:02:16.650] - Liz Wilcox
It could be, I just recorded this new podcast episode, and I recorded this episode in particular because so and so emailed me asking me this question. Show that you are invested in your readers. No one is going to invest in you if they don't know you're invested in them first, right? The second thing is to just relate to your people. And note, I didn't say, I try to be interesting, right? Let's leave interesting for like, celebrities or something. But it can be really simple to relate to your audience, right? Like, even when Elizabeth was reading my bio, it was like, Oh, she loves the '90s and headbands and the beach. You You probably had those images in your head as she's reading them, right? That's just a very simple way to relate to people. Like, Oh, yeah, I loved the '90s, or boy bands, gross. Headbands, that's weird. Either way, we're relating to our people. And this is really, really important. Why? Because people buy from people they trust, right? So if we can not only show that we are invested in them, but we can become that relatable person. Oh, my gosh, it's going to be over for everyone else.

[00:03:33.470] - Liz Wilcox
And the last thing, and this is what trips people up the most, is just stay top of mind. And no, I don't mean you have to email daily, or if you skip a week, all has been lost. But it is important to stay top of mind because, listen, people don't buy when you sell something. They buy when they're ready, right? So if you're only emailing once a week, every once in a while, If they want a solution on the 15th of the month, but you're not emailing them until the first, they're going to go with whoever's top of mind, right? Think about if and when you buy a house. Who is your realtor? Probably the person you know, or maybe the last person that handed you their card, the first person that popped up on Zillow, right? They're the top of mind person. So I really recommend staying top of mind, writing emails at least once a week. But guess what? These emails don't have to be hard. And when you do these first two things, when you show you're invested, when you become relatable, staying top of mind becomes a lot easier.

[00:04:46.850] - Liz Stapleton, Host
I like that. So when you're trying to stay top of mind, right, as your audience grows, I feel like it can be difficult to make it still feel personal and relevant, right? So what are some tips you have to make sure that what you're writing, even when it's going out to thousands of people, still feels really personal?

[00:05:09.830] - Liz Wilcox
Yeah. So when it comes to making the emails personal, Again, think about what is relatable for the majority of your people, right? For me, I tend to use the '90s, right? That's relatable for most people, even if you're a Gen-X or a boomer. You were there, right? You remember that stuff. And then also just the idiosyncrasies of life make it personal. For example, a lot of email marketers will tell you, Oh, just tell stories. Well, that's hard. But instead of telling a story, just do a personal update, 2-3 sentences, like something you've done since the last time you e-mailed someone, right? And so this can be, Oh, I took the dog for a walk. My kids are on half days, and I'm rushing to get work done before they get home. What's more relatable than something like that, right? My fridge just broke. I'm going to... I'm writing you really quick before the repair man gets here. Those little things, those little life moments, those everyday things are incredibly relatable. And it's not about making everything customizable and segmenting your list like crazy. It's more about pulling out those things in life that everyone has a personal connection to.

[00:06:43.600] - Liz Stapleton, Host
I like that you said that and it's not all focused on the tech side of things, because one of my other questions is going to be, how do you grow, keep things simple but effective? Because I know I was totally guilty of it. I had so many opt-ins and then so many different welcome sequences that then led to this and led to that. And it's like a hot mess it feels like at this point. I'm just trying. I've been at this for 10 years. I'm just trying to simplify. So how can people avoid the mistake I made, I guess, and keep a bit simple and keep growing? Because sometimes you feel like you need to create another freebie or opt-in or whatever to keep things moving. Yeah.

[00:07:24.500] - Liz Wilcox
Chances are you don't need another opt-in. Let's just clear the air on that. You probably just, you need to promote your current opt-in more. You need to find more people for that. Visibility is really, really important, right? So instead of thinking, Oh, I got to create something new. This isn't working. It's like, Okay, well, what are you doing to make this work in the first place? And can you repeat the main question? Because I want to make sure that I get it right. I just wanted to talk about that real quick.

[00:07:55.210] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Yeah, no. As they grow, how can they keep their approach simple but still effective?

[00:08:00.670] - Liz Wilcox
Oh, yeah. Number one thing with anything in business, intentionality, right? What is your intention? Think about the vision that you have for your subscribers. For example, my vision is you make money with email marketing. I don't care about anything else. I don't care about your podcast mic, how your screen looks, your webinars, what tools you're using. All I care is that you make money with email marketing. So when it comes to what I'm putting in the newsletters, how I'm getting people on my list, I just always keep that in mind. Is this going to help people make money with email marketing? That's my vision for you. And when it comes to emails, honestly, let this be, I don't know, a permission slip. You want it to be simple. No one wants to read long, convoluted, gigantic newsletters, right? Unless they're super duper fans. And the majority of your list, they're probably just interested. They're not super duper fans yet, right? Yeah, right. And so we just want to get in the inbox. We want to get to the point, and we want to get out. So instead of thinking, Oh, I've got to have this for them.

[00:09:09.530] - Liz Wilcox
I have to create value over here. I have to create another freebie over here. Just think, What is the simplest way I can help them with that vision today? And it might be, Oh, I recorded this podcast episode. It's 20 minutes long. You should listen to it because A, B, C reasons. Okay, enjoy. Bye. We don't need to set up a story and move it into whatever. Just being as quick, honest, and, I don't know, transparent as you can be in those emails is a great way to keep it simple. And the last thing I'll say is, and I say this with love, love yourself a little bit more, my friend. Getting things complicated is an act of disservice for yourself. Letting yourself keep things simple is really, number one, it's going to help you love yourself more. I know that's woo-woo, but it's going to help you keep going. Email is already hard, so we don't need to add on all these layers. When in doubt, how can you subtract from your strategy to just get in there, connect with your audience, and get them moving?

[00:10:24.470] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Yeah, I like that. So speaking of connecting and getting them moving, what are some maybe creative, low stress ways for you to keep your email subscribers engaged, but at the same time, not overwhelm them? I know you're a really good example.

[00:10:38.470] - Liz Wilcox
Okay. So my number one way to get people to engage without overwhelming them and myself is to get very simple replies. Okay. Email might feel like, oh, it's about closing the sale, but really it's about opening up relationships. And the easiest way to do this is to just ask simple yes or no These are low effort for you and your reader, right? So for example, one of my questions is, do you have a weekly newsletter? Hit reply, yes or no. They might say, no, but I want to, yes, I love it, or Yes, I love it. Or yes, but I usually feel like crap after I hit send. And then that allows me to open up the conversation. Maybe I've got a podcast episode that helps them. Oh, you know what? You said this about it being so stressful. Here's my podcast episode. Here's my blog post. Or just typing a few bits of encouragement, right? Or putting, Oh, you need my membership then? Click here, right? It's about opening up that relationship. And it's a real low effort. You don't have to, with a yes or no question, you don't have to come in with a novel, right?

[00:11:51.590] - Liz Wilcox
You can just give them a few quick tips or some encouragement, or point them to your Facebook group, or point them to even some outward content that maybe you didn't even create that could help them, or point them to your consultation or whatever. You don't have to give them everything in that reply. That's a really low lift way to keep people engaged. Another way is to talk about things that aren't even related to your industry, but are absolutely relatable, right? I'll give you a real good, if you have no idea what to write in your next newsletter, write this one. It's It's called Beach or Mountains. That's the subject line. And you can say, Hey, Liz, I don't know why, but I'm really interested in knowing. I know this has nothing to do with XYZ, whatever we normally talk about. But do you like the beach or mountains? And getting people to click like that? Because that's something, Oh, I'm a beach girly for sure. Oh, no, I love the mountains. And just getting them to click, again, it's this low effort thing. It's this low responsibility for the reader because it's not like, Oh, what is she trying to get out of this?

[00:13:05.890] - Liz Wilcox
If I click this, is it going to go to a funnel or whatever? It's just so out of the box, but it gets people involved. Also, some people might hit reply, Oh my gosh, I love the beach. Here's a picture of me. Again, it's about opening up those conversations. I recommend doing stuff like this every now and again to the questions point of, How do we get people engaged? But When we can get them to click on something like that, the next time when we say, Hey, are you interested in a product on X or Z? They're already used to clicking on that, and so they're more likely to click later.

[00:13:44.860] - Liz Stapleton, Host
I like that. I'm curious because you said you don't need to give them all the answers. You can refer to things if someone's asking a question. Do you ever... Because first of all, if anyone ever gets a negative email, just know that means you've made it. I think that's in my opinion. Amen. If someone emails you, and it's full on. I literally... That's how I knew I made it. I don't remember when, but someone literally joined my email list just so they could get my email and email me a 800-word diatribe. And I was like, Made it.

[00:14:20.360] - Liz Wilcox
Made it, baby.

[00:14:21.340] - Liz Stapleton, Host
But sometimes it's not that direct. Sometimes it just seems like they're asking a question, they want to catch you out in something, but they just seem to be coming from a native space. Do you even entertain responding to those? Do you just say, I'm letting this one go?

[00:14:34.560] - Liz Wilcox
Such a good question. I honestly, I don't mind trolls, so to speak. I actually, personally, I love customer service, and I have found that I can turn people around. But that is a skill, okay? And it doesn't affect me here, right? And so if you don't feel like you have that skill, or it just feels like a lot, don't entertain it. Just delete. Or if you're an archive person, archive it, because it's not worth it. Your energy is better spent doing the next thing that's going to grow your business, right? And so making sure you protect that energy and just delete, unless it's a customer who's really ticked off and actually needs a response, right? Needs asking for a refund, even though they're not being tactful about it. But if it's just someone, like Liz said, that's just there to spew hatred, peace out. You can definitely just delete. But I will say there are some times where I do get haters, and it's so much for me that I can't help but respond and just say my piece. I always say, I never defend myself, but I reserve the right to clarify, right? And so if someone's coming at me, Oh, this is garbage, whatever, whatever, I don't have to defend myself.

[00:16:12.150] - Liz Wilcox
Oh, that's not true. I do, but I can clarify my intentions if and when I feel that's appropriate.

[00:16:21.640] - Liz Stapleton, Host
No, I like that. And I will say for people, you can unsubscribe people, too.

[00:16:26.990] - Liz Wilcox
Oh, my. Preach on the Preach on the pulpit, baby. Yes, listen, you all, and this happens in my Facebook a lot. Oh, I got this hate. It's like you can block them. You can delete them from your list. You can unsubscribe them. There's been a few people, and in my business that have purchased something, asked for a refund, been less than kind, purchased something again, the same thing. And you can actually even block people from purchasing your products.

[00:16:57.870] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Yup, I've definitely done that. Or They bought it, and then they filed a complaint with the company, which I still won. Because I could prove, Oh, well, it must have been my husband bought it, and I didn't realize. I'm like, Okay. No, me.

[00:17:13.960] - Liz Wilcox
That's a little Yeah, that's a little side note. But yes, if you're feeling some type of way, just unsubscribe it. You don't even have to reply.

[00:17:24.480] - Liz Stapleton, Host
You don't need to justify.

[00:17:26.190] - Liz Wilcox
Exactly. It's very important, especially in those first few years of starting your blog or business, you've got to protect your energy because it takes a lot to get something off the ground or to get it moving the way you want it to move. And so, yeah, it's all about follow or friend customer. If you're never going to be friends with that person, you're out of here.

[00:17:49.270] - Liz Stapleton, Host
I like that way to bring it back to that initial thing. Okay, so we've talked about, again, follow from customer and you don't have to shove your stuff down their throats. You just need to stay top of mind. So that's the right way to go about things. And I think we've touched on some mistakes as well. But let's dig into a little bit more of common mistakes you see when people are trying to monetize their list because everyone's like, Oh, the money is in the list. And a lot of times when you're starting out, you're just like, I feel like all I'm doing is paying for my list, and I'm not getting a return. So what are some mistakes people make when trying to monetize, and how can they avoid them?

[00:18:24.670] - Liz Wilcox
I think the biggest mistake I see, this is such a good question, is people trying to monetize a product that they haven't gotten feedback on. So, Oh, I just have this idea. I'm going to create it, and then I'm going to sell it. You got to get feedback, especially when you're first starting to monetize, and you do have, even if you've just got 50 people on your list, getting them involved in the creation of the product is going to help you succeed so much faster. It's going to help you see your blind spots. It's going to help you make the product better. And remember, we talked about investing, right? Investing in your audience. This is going to show you're invested so that people invest in the product and the success of it before you even ask them for a dollar. When I was creating my first digital product, I was an RV travel blogger, and I had no idea what product to create, but I knew I needed to monetize that list. What's the point? And I asked people, Why do you follow me? I don't I don't even really know what I'm doing. Sometimes I talk about this, sometimes I talk about that.

[00:19:34.720] - Liz Wilcox
I said, Well, Liz, you're really funny. You can tell a good story. So I created a book of funny stories around RV Travel. And guess what? It sold. And I also didn't create it until I got my first sale. I said, Okay, I've got this idea now that you told me I'm a funny storyteller. Now, here's a PayPal link. It's going to be $20 bucks, but you can buy it for $10. And I got, I think, one or two sales. And that's when I knew, okay, I'm going to create the book. Because at the time, I was brand new. Oh, my gosh, I just made $20 off something that doesn't exist yet? Holy crap. This is amazing. So I think the biggest mistake I see is creating in a silo. Oh, I've been talking, I've been opening. I'm doing the things, listen, I'm getting replies, but not telling anyone about the product. So as you create it, sharing in your emails. Hey, I picked the platform. I'm going to go with WordPress. I'm on Kajabi. Even if you're like, Oh, my gosh, I'm a crochet blogger. They don't give a crap. Yes, they do. They want to see the process.

[00:20:44.330] - Liz Wilcox
They signed up for your list, not only for your tips, but like emphasis on your, right? They like you. There's something about you that they like. And they will like, I promise, they will like seeing the behind the scenes stuff. So That's the biggest mistake I see.

[00:21:02.410] - Liz Stapleton, Host
I like that. Okay, so we need to wrap up. I think that was a fantastic tip. I know you have tons of stuff that you can share with them. You've got a new podcast. It's amazing if people haven't given it a listen, definitely go check that out. But where do you want people to find you? What should they do? What link is going to be on this page?

[00:21:21.510] - Liz Wilcox
Oh, yeah, of course. I'm an email marketer. I want you to join my email list, baby. You can go directly to lizwilcox.com. Hit the hot pink button, you're going to get three things. Number one, you're going to get an entire welcome sequence already written for you. So as you grow your list, as you find those followers, you're going to know exactly how to welcome them, sharing that vision with them, sharing the expectations, and helping you monetize from day one with that welcome sequence. You're also going to get three newsletter samples, one to show you how to click, one to show you how to get people to buy, and a third, how to get people to reply, which we talked a lot about today. And if that's not enough, you're also going to get 52 subject lines for a year full of prompts. All that, lizwilcox.com, hot pink button, or I'm sure there's some beautiful button somewhere. It'll be on the screen. Let me just point in all directions. I'm sure you'll find it. I'd love to help you with your email marketing. It really is the way that I've changed my life. I'm sure Liz can attest to it.

[00:22:26.160] - Liz Wilcox
It's awesome.

[00:22:27.050] - Liz Stapleton, Host
All right. And I know you have something for those that upgrade their past as well. Can you tell us about that?

[00:22:32.530] - Liz Wilcox
Yeah. So if you upgrade, remember we talked about the biggest mistake you can make with monetizing your list is to not tell anyone to create in a silo. I actually have some pre-sell templates. It's called Just If you sell it normally $49, you're going to get it for free. And those are templates to get people to buy. I got people to buy my book before you even create the product. Super excited for you to have them. So upgrade now.

[00:22:58.830] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Yeah, definitely check that out, you guys. Liz Wilcox is always fantastic to learn from. I always learn something new when I talk to her. Liz, thank you so much. I really appreciate you teaching.

[00:23:09.140] - Liz Wilcox
Yeah. Thank you for having me.
