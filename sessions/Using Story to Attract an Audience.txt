Liz Stapleton [00:00:00]:
Guys, welcome to today's session with Amanda Page, a writer and host of the Byline Breakthrough podcast. Actually, the breakthrough in her podcast is where I got the idea for Breakthrough in the Summit name and also of the Isle of Skye writing retreat. She is one of my favorite people to read. She's an incredible writer and to talk to. I met her many years ago.

Amanda Page [00:00:22]:
So.

Liz Stapleton [00:00:22]:
Amanda.

Amanda Page [00:00:23]:
Thank you. Oh, absolutely. Thanks for having me.

Liz Stapleton [00:00:26]:
Yeah. So I don't read a lot of email newsletters. I'm on a bunch. But yours I always read because they're always so personable.

Amanda Page [00:00:37]:
They're so good guys.

Liz Stapleton [00:00:38]:
Definitely join her email list. There's a link below. But so today we're going to be talking about writing content where we kind of are. Like, you need to post once a week or two times a week or three times a week if you're trying to grow. But you need to make it stand.

Amanda Page [00:00:53]:
Out because you were in the personal.

Liz Stapleton [00:00:56]:
Finance space, as am I, although technically I haven't written for it lately. And there's tons of personal finance blogs. How do you make it that people.

Amanda Page [00:01:05]:
Want to read your post on budget.

Liz Stapleton [00:01:08]:
Travel to Scotland or something, as opposed to someone else's? Let's start there is we're going to be talking about how to make writing.

Amanda Page [00:01:18]:
Content that anyone could write, but make.

Liz Stapleton [00:01:19]:
It uniquely you and something people can use.

Liz Stapleton [00:01:23]:
Right?

Liz Stapleton [00:01:23]:
Is that where we're going?

Amanda Page [00:01:24]:
Yeah, I think so.

Amanda Page [00:01:25]:
And I think a lot of advice.

Amanda Page [00:01:28]:
I see about writing on blogs is.

Amanda Page [00:01:33]:
Or depending on what your goal is for your blog

Amanda Page [00:01:42]:
Make it focused on the person reading. And I agree that you should have.

Amanda Page [00:01:48]:
An awareness of that and a focus on that. But the way you interpret that, I.

Amanda Page [00:01:54]:
Think, is really important. Is it I'm instructing them on something? Is it I'm trying to sell them on something? Is it I'm trying to make a connection with them? I think the answer should always be I'm trying to make a connection with them. And the way that we as humans connect is through personal stories.

Amanda Page [00:02:15]:
In terms of my budget travel to Scotland story, why would you read that instead and mine instead of someone else's one, I would say read them all. Right, read them all.

Amanda Page [00:02:30]:
But why you would want mine in.

Amanda Page [00:02:33]:
Particular would be how much do you.

Amanda Page [00:02:35]:
Connect to my story?

Amanda Page [00:02:37]:
So you would have to read.

Amanda Page [00:02:38]:
You'd have to kind of some of.

Amanda Page [00:02:42]:
My job in that, I think, is to make sure that I have a.

Amanda Page [00:02:45]:
Compelling headline or title that can get.

Amanda Page [00:02:50]:
Real overwhelming real quick, too. When you start to look at, I know if any beginners are on listening.

Amanda Page [00:02:55]:
Now, there are headline evaluators and different.

Amanda Page [00:03:01]:
Tools to use, and I found those incredibly frustrating and overwhelming.

Amanda Page [00:03:06]:
And they would gum up the wheels, to be honest.

Amanda Page [00:03:10]:
I would start to use them, and then I would not write posts that I couldn't get the perfect title for, even though it would have been really connective content or something that I was really working through or a really vulnerable.

Amanda Page [00:03:22]:
Post that people probably really would have.

Amanda Page [00:03:26]:
Liked to have seen. Because that's another kind of key.

Amanda Page [00:03:32]:
In this puzzle.

Liz Stapleton [00:03:35]:
Puzzle that is blogging that have a never ending amount of pieces yeah.

Amanda Page [00:03:42]:
Is to really make sure that you're also being vulnerable. I mean, that's another way to connect with your audience and tell vulnerable stories, then.

Amanda Page [00:03:49]:
And that's probably where, I think, obviously.

Amanda Page [00:03:52]:
In my budget, travel to Scotland story.

Amanda Page [00:03:56]:
You would have to know that I.

Amanda Page [00:03:59]:
Didn'T have anything to do. So I asked friends, what should I do in Scotland? Someone suggested I go to Skye. I went to Skye and made a.

Amanda Page [00:04:08]:
Friend on the way and they suggested.

Amanda Page [00:04:10]:
I would be back. So there's story there, right? Like, there's story there and everything I write about it then is going to come from that place.

Liz Stapleton [00:04:20]:
Yeah. And I think you're not telling....I think when you're writing blog posts, yes, you need to have story. That's what we're talking about. We'll get to list posts and how to use in a minute.

Amanda Page [00:04:27]:
But your story isn't just like, oh.

Liz Stapleton [00:04:29]:
You'Re telling a story, tell a story. Right, I'm telling a story and then I'm pulling out the bits that are kind of universal.

Amanda Page [00:04:37]:
Right.

Liz Stapleton [00:04:37]:
It's like the more specific a story is, the more universal elements there are to it. I think you see that in movies and TV shows and stuff, like, you're obsessed with The Witcher right now and Game of Thrones and Dragons Don't Exist. But the tension of fighting with your siblings, I mean, obviously not, but there's universal truth even in the craziest things. And so pulling out the universal truth.

Liz Stapleton [00:05:05]:
Of your story so that someone can take it and apply it to their own.

Amanda Page [00:05:09]:
Yeah, absolutely. Like connecting to the elements in the.

Amanda Page [00:05:12]:
Story that you're going to recognize or.

Liz Stapleton [00:05:15]:
The lessons you learned. Because anyone can write a how to get out of debt post.

Liz Stapleton [00:05:20]:
Right. But it's, hey, this is how I got out of debt, and these are some mistakes I made.

Liz Stapleton [00:05:28]:
Here's how I think I could have done better.

Liz Stapleton [00:05:25]:
You're telling your story, but you're also giving them action steps so you can marry the sort of helpfulness in the Story, which makes it more people would want to read that, I feel like.

Amanda Page [00:05:42]:
Yeah, I think so. I mean, I think anytime you can contextualize anything, it's going to be a win. And I think that what you're saying with trying to find the universal elements in a story.

Amanda Page [00:05:53]:
There are storytelling structures like the hero's.

Amanda Page [00:05:59]:
Journey or things like that, that we can look at. And I think that to break it down into blog posts, you can think about your journey that way.

Amanda Page [00:06:10]:
And then what's each individual post on the way on this journey right.

Amanda Page [00:06:16]:
So then you're telling individual stories.

Amanda Page [00:06:18]:
But the overarching thing is the universal thing.

Amanda Page [00:06:22]:
Because, I mean, my story of getting out of debt, it's never just a get out of debt story right there's. How I got in debt story, who I was at the time of the.

Amanda Page [00:06:31]:
Debt, how long I had the debt.

Amanda Page [00:06:32]:
What it was doing in my life. Like, there are all those pieces and there's a story or several stories for.

Liz Stapleton [00:06:38]:
Each, the breaking point of you have.

Amanda Page [00:06:40]:
To get rid of it. Yeah, 100%.

Amanda Page [00:06:44]:
And I think that's what people are looking for is like, what was finally the tipping point? What was the breakthrough that got you to that point? What did you really have to focus on? And I think that there are valuable moments in real time journeys, which is how I was writing mine for Dream Beyond Debt. At the time when we met in the personal finance space, I had no idea what I was doing, what was happening. It was like, I'm just trying to get out of this $48,000 of debt, and I want to do it in this time frame. But especially now, a few years later.

Amanda Page [00:07:22]:
After I've paid off that debt, it's.

Amanda Page [00:07:24]:
Really valuable to go back and look.

Amanda Page [00:07:26]:
At that journey and see where the universal elements really are.

Liz Stapleton [00:07:32]:
Yeah. So you don't have to be writing.

Amanda Page [00:07:34]:
From a place of I'm teaching you.

Liz Stapleton [00:05:37]:
You can be writing from a place of I'm sharing. As I figure it out, you're not alone.

Amanda Page [00:07:42]:
Yes, I think that's highly valuable, and.

Amanda Page [00:07:46]:
I think that's really where a lot of the success comes in. I mean, I know especially back in the day when mom blogs were starting or design blogs and all the sewing.

Amanda Page [00:08:02]:
Blogs, those connections, although there was always.

Amanda Page [00:08:08]:
An element of this is how I.

Amanda Page [00:08:09]:
Do this, those connections were really also.

Amanda Page [00:08:12]:
About, hey, I'm a woman who enjoys this too. So it's just sharing stories.

Amanda Page [00:08:17]:
It wasn't even about like, let's all monetize.

Liz Stapleton [00:08:21]:
Yeah, because there is a lot of focus of let's all monetize. And yes, we're going to talk about monetization in the Summit too.

Amanda Page [00:08:29]:
Right.

Liz Stapleton [00:08:29]:
Because blogging is work, and I fully believe you should get paid for your hard work. It may take time.

Amanda Page [00:08:35]:
It's not thing when it comes to.

Liz Stapleton [00:07:46]:
Blogging, but you need to write this kind of post and monetize it this way, and there's a lot out there like that. And you had mentioned before we started.Recording the how to post or the listicles. Do you want to kind of share.

Liz Stapleton [00:08:54]:
Your thoughts on that again?

Amanda Page [00:08:56]:
Yes, I do. Very badly. So, again, when I was just starting.

Amanda Page [00:09:02]:
And I was reading about, like, I.

Amanda Page [00:09:06]:
Was reading around in the personal finance space and there were several posts about how to monetize, and then anytime that you start to think about maybe turning something into a business, you're going to.

Amanda Page [00:09:16]:
Go read how to turn this into a business. And you're going to see a lot.

Amanda Page [00:09:22]:
Of how to write these headlines, how to write copy, how to write customer focused posts that sell and it can.

Amanda Page [00:09:30]:
Get really overwhelming really quickly and it is a particular skill to develop in.

Amanda Page [00:09:37]:
Order to write those kinds of posts.

Amanda Page [00:09:39]:
But also if you don't have anything.

Amanda Page [00:09:42]:
To sell from the beginning, I wasn't trying to sell my story, I didn't have a product. I wasn't even really trying to sell the blog. Right. If you don't have anything to sell or if you're not particularly in the.

Amanda Page [00:09:55]:
Headspace to be sold.

Amanda Page [00:09:59]:
Customer focused content isn't really going to be connective for your audience. There's plenty out there too on how to do both, like how to make a post that is connective and.

Amanda Page [00:09:58]:
cost effective and will sell you on a product or a service. But really, those things get tiresome very quickly. I can't tell you how many I've seen on like 15 side hustles you've never heard of. And then you go on and it's the same damn hustles that we've been talking about for ten years. I've heard of these and I know people who have done them and those stories are terrible. So maybe like seeking out those kinds of personal stories, you might look at a list like that and it's like, sure, but.

Amanda Page [00:10:57]:
I'm not going to invest my time, my energy, or my money.

Liz Stapleton [00:10:54]:
Go back to that resource again. throw out junk. Yeah, exactly.

Amanda Page [00:11:09]:
Junk is one way to think about it, for sure.

Amanda Page [00:11:13]:
Because when I was heavily into the personal finance space, I probably read 15 blog blogs a day, right.

Amanda Page [00:11:25]:
I was in there. I was in a particularly small community of women who were in student loan debt or just a nice really small niche and.

Amanda Page [00:11:44]:
But I was still reading.

Amanda Page [00:11:46]:
These posts and that's a lot to read in a day, right? And I would read those daily and just kind of stay on top of that community and be engaged with that community. You don't build community with lists or like really thin how to's you build.

Amanda Page [00:12:04]:
Community with stories of vulnerability from your.

Amanda Page [00:12:07]:
Own life that you are sharing with.

Amanda Page [00:12:09]:
Other people who are also interested in doing something similar as to what you're doing.

Liz Stapleton [00:11:08]:
Yeah. And as you said, you can marry that. You can have a listicle do.

Amanda Page [00:12:23]:
Well, so long as it's got the.

Liz Stapleton [00:12:23]:
Story, the personal element to it. But you can't have a listicle without story. You can have a story without a listicle.

Amanda Page [00:12:31]:
But for those types of posts to really succeed, you need to have a.

Liz Stapleton [00:12:38]:
Personal element to it that makes it stand out. That doesn't just make it I think.

Amanda Page [00:12:43]:
It'S a matter of when you're doing.

Liz Stapleton [00:12:45]:
A blog and you're hearing all these posting schedules and there's some truth to it, like you want to post consistently, right? But I would rather consistently do once a month something good and quality. And I'm not talking like good quality, 3000 words, perfectly SEO optimized. I mean, yes, that's great too, but.

Liz Stapleton [00:12:29]:
Something quality as opposed to quantity when it comes to blogs, because if they.

Amanda Page [00:13:11]:
Come to your site and it's a.

Liz Stapleton [00:13:10]:
Come to your site and it's a post that's just that I need to get something out and it's not very helpful or good or have a story.

Amanda Page [00:13:18]:
They're not going to come back.

Liz Stapleton [00:13:22]:
But if every single one of your.

Amanda Page [00:13:24]:
Posts has something in there, a story, I think it's far more compelling.

Liz Stapleton [00:13:20]:
You're going to want to go back like you said you did, like 15 blogs. I did. I had like a bookmark folder of personal finance sites that I would go look.

Amanda Page [00:13:37]:
Did they do a new post yet?

Liz Stapleton [00:13:39]:
Yeah, absolutely. Yeah.

Amanda Page [00:13:37]:
I was waiting to hear from my friends. That's how it felt. Just thinking about that schedule, to that posting schedule. I mean, when I started Dream Beyond. Debt, I was posting three times a.

Liz Stapleton [00:13:52]:
Debt, I was posting three times a.

Amanda Page [00:13:54]:
Week, which seems crazy to me now, but also I wasn't worried about SEO optimization. I was just like, here's my story.

Amanda Page [00:13:53]:
It was much easier to think about. . Yeah.

Liz Stapleton [00:14:03]:
Stories are easier to write. When you're trying to do the perfect post for computers, which is what that is. And yeah, you want to have some SEO optimization, you don't have to go over the top. There's some basics. It doesn't have to be insanely hard. Then you're writing for computer, not for the people that will return.

Amanda Page [00:14:25]:
Right?

Liz Stapleton [00:14:25]:
So you may get fresh people in, but the ones that return, they're going.

Amanda Page [00:14:30]:
To be the ones that when you.

Liz Stapleton [00:14:23]:
To be the ones that when you do finally get to a point of you're like, guys, I've struggled with this because you've written about your story, you're.

Amanda Page [00:14:33]:
You'Re like, guys, I've struggled with this because you've written about your story, you're.

Liz Stapleton [00:14:36]:
Like, I found this tool and it is changing my life, They're going to be like, bought, done.

Amanda Page [00:14:40]:
They're going to be like, bought, done.

Liz Stapleton [00:14:44]:
Or I created this. They're the fans.

Amanda Page [00:14:47]:
I think you don't need a ton.

Liz Stapleton [00:14:41]:
I think you don't need a ton of traffic to be successful as a blogger. And I feel like if you're only writing for a computer, that's the only thing you're going after.

Amanda Page [00:14:54]:
Yeah, agreed.

Amanda Page [00:14:58]:
I don't pay attention to SEO or any of that stuff right now, and I'm so much happier. And I know that I'm not blogging on such a regular schedule, but I do have my website and your newsletter.

Liz Stapleton [00:15:10]:
Is regular and it's always really good.

Liz Stapleton [00:15:12]:
Thank you.

Liz Stapleton [00:14:54]:
But you're building that community that those loyal fans, I think Pat Flynn calls them superfans, right? Something like that. They'll make a bigger difference. I've had high traffic, I got less.

Amanda Page [00:15:28]:
At more wine, up to a pretty.

Liz Stapleton [00:15:30]:
Good place, and I was really excited about it, but it wasn't actually earning.

Amanda Page [00:15:33]:
That much and I kind of stepped.

Liz Stapleton [00:15:35]:
Back from it and I looked at some other things and I focused on my other site. And this last year, I started doing less. I was like, I'm not doing social media.

Liz Stapleton [00:15:42]:
I'm not.

Liz Stapleton [00:15:43]:
I tried YouTube out for a while and I enjoyed it and I value it, but I was like, you know what, it's getting to be too much and having do videos preventing me from putting out posts. And you know what happened? So 2018, I made that decision.

Amanda Page [00:15:57]:
2019, I had more product sales than.

Liz Stapleton [00:16:00]:
I ever had on my site.

Amanda Page [00:16:02]:
My traffic went down, but I had.

Liz Stapleton [00:15:27]:
My traffic went down, but I had. A better sort of I feel more connected to my audience. I had a better conversion. Yeah. I've had my highest self employed income in 2019.

Amanda Page [00:16:13]:
Yeah, I see that.

Amanda Page [00:16:20]:
And I was just reading a newsletter today, I think about that, that people think that you need big lists or that really it's just a few people, and that service businesses, too. And really a blog, I think, kind of exists in the beginning as a service business.

Amanda Page [00:16:38]:
Easy.

Liz Stapleton [00:16:40]:
Yeah.

Amanda Page [00:16:41]:
That those are harder to build, but they're also harder to build than product.

Amanda Page [00:16:48]:
Businesses, but.

Amanda Page [00:16:18]:
They're more scalable later, and.

Amanda Page [00:16:52]:
They're more like, that's not it.

Liz Stapleton [00:16:58]:
I feel like it's the other way around.

Amanda Page [00:16:59]:
Product businesses are harder to build, but.

Liz Stapleton [00:17:01]:
Are more scalable, service based businesses, easier to start.

Amanda Page [00:16:54]:
Easier to start, hard to scale.

Liz Stapleton [00:17:08]:
Yeah, because you can only work with so many clients.

Amanda Page [00:17:12]:
Right.

Liz Stapleton [00:17:12]:
And I've run into that, and then you're like, okay, well, do I want to start an agency? And it's like, no, I don't.

Amanda Page [00:17:18]:
Yeah, no, but you've worked with clients, so you know what clients need. You could create a course on how to serve this client.

Liz Stapleton [00:17:24]:
Yeah.

Amanda Page [00:17:24]:
So there's lots of ways to I mean, I don't think offering a service.

Liz Stapleton [00:16:57]:
So there's lots of ways to I mean, I don't think offering a service through your blog to kind of try to make money to get that more.

Amanda Page [00:17:31]:
To make money to get that more.

Liz Stapleton [00:17:31]:
Flexible lifestyle, which I feel a lot of people look turn to blogging, too. I don't think there's anything wrong from that. I think you can learn a lot from it, but eventually some people love.

Amanda Page [00:17:39]:
From it, but eventually some people love.

Liz Stapleton [00:17:40]:
Doing client based business, and that's what they do, and that's great. But for me, I was like, I.

Amanda Page [00:17:44]:
They do, and that's great. But for me, I was like, I.

Liz Stapleton [00:17:46]:
Don't, I'm finding it hard to, like take a vacation because I have especially.

Amanda Page [00:17:48]:
Take a vacation because I have especially.

Liz Stapleton [00:17:51]:
The services I offered doing Pinterest management. I'm like, Well, I've got to do all the scheduling. I've got to do it's a consistent thing, which is great, consistent income. But it was hard. I was like, I really had to work hard to get ahead so that I could then take time off to go on vacation.

Amanda Page [00:18:07]:
Right.

Amanda Page [00:18:09]:
I think some of that too comes in. What you want your blog to do? Like, I didn't start a blog thinking, oh, I'm going to make a ton of money.

Amanda Page [00:18:18]:
Right?

Amanda Page [00:18:18]:
I was thrilled when I got $300 for a sponsored post, and I was never making I never had the tons of traffic. When I got to $100 in my Google Ad revenue, I was like, Whoa, that was a big deal. I was blogging to stay accountable, to.

Amanda Page [00:18:39]:
Pay off the debt at first, and.

Amanda Page [00:18:41]:
Then I was blogging to stay engaged with the community. And I think that is important to keep in mind. A lot of blogs are existing as a marketing piece of the business, and.

Amanda Page [00:18:56]:
I think that's a shift in the mindset or the way that those writers.

Amanda Page [00:19:03]:
Of those posts are looking at the audience, like to sell to. But it's the same thing, I think.

Amanda Page [00:19:10]:
That you're not going to sell unless you're sharing a story.

Liz Stapleton [00:19:17]:
Okay.

Liz Stapleton [00:17:49]:
Because the aim of the Summit is to be really kind of action oriented. So we're like, you've got to do stories.

Amanda Page [00:19:22]:
So we're like, you've got to do stories.

Liz Stapleton [00:19:23]:
Do you have any thoughts on sort. Of how to kind of figure out.

Amanda Page [00:19:26]:
Of how to kind of figure out.

Liz Stapleton [00:19:27]:
What stories to tell or how to kind of go about having a consistent editorial calendar, whether that's once a week.

Amanda Page [00:19:30]:
Kind of go about having a consistent editorial calendar, whether that's once a week.

Liz Stapleton [00:19:36]:
Three times, once a month, whatever, where you're doing stories? Because it's kind of a catch 22, right, is blogging can take over your life, but then you're not really living life, and then you don't really have as many stories. So thoughts on sort of that, I guess.

Amanda Page [00:19:49]:
So thoughts on sort of that, I guess.

Amanda Page [00:19:52]:
Yeah, I have lots of thoughts on that as well. One of them is just to kind of train your mind. When I was posting three times a.

Amanda Page [00:19:58]:
Week, I was always kind of looking at life through the lens of, is this shareable?

Amanda Page [00:20:06]:
Is this something interesting?

Liz Stapleton [00:20:07]:
And also talk to your people.

Amanda Page [00:20:10]:
And by your people, I mean your friends and family. You know when a story is bad.

Amanda Page [00:20:14]:
And you know when it lands and.

Amanda Page [00:20:15]:
If it's landing with your people, it'll land with your audience. It's a lot like the way that live storytellers or comedians work sometimes. Like, you've got to kind of try out your material. So talk to your people.

Liz Stapleton [00:20:32]:
And then.

Amanda Page [00:19:50]:
And then. Just give yourself some space to train.

Amanda Page [00:20:35]:
Your mind to start looking for the.

Amanda Page [00:20:38]:
Stories in your life. And one way to do that is.

Amanda Page [00:20:41]:
Just to start, like journaling or even.

Amanda Page [00:20:44]:
Better, just making lists of the stories that you already think might be interesting.

Amanda Page [00:20:51]:
And I know epic, they don't, they.

Amanda Page [00:20:33]:
Don't need to be epic. They can be tiny. They could be tiny. You can have three stories in one thing. Like it's these three things happened. And altogether, I think they mean this.

Amanda Page [00:21:04]:
Right, like boom post.

Amanda Page [00:21:07]:
You just have to start looking at your life through that lens.

Amanda Page [00:21:12]:
For sure, and keeping track.

Liz Stapleton [00:21:14]:
So having like a pen and paper or just making notes in your phone wherever you are, having a place to when you get an idea about something.

Amanda Page [00:21:23]:
And how it can play out on your blog, write it down.

Liz Stapleton [00:21:26]:
And you may not use all of them, and that's okay, but the more you have, the easier it is.

Amanda Page [00:21:02]:
Oh, yeah, and I still have, like I still come across lists of titles for things for Dream Beyond Debt that I never used, still happening for my weekly prompt. And those are interesting. I don't have an editorial calendar for those. I do have a list of things I would like. Here's some subjects that I want to touch on, but those are really coming from my life in the week that I'm writing them. And I know a lot of people batch your work and do that stuff, and maybe I'll get to that point someday. But really, I'm talking to my audience.

Amanda Page [00:22:01]:
About like, hey, is this stuff happening.

Amanda Page [00:22:05]:
For you guys now, too? My last one was what I'm going to be available for this year. It's really about setting boundaries. And it's like, I guarantee that other people are thinking about what boundaries do I need to set? Because I've been talking to my people. We're all talking about that.

Liz Stapleton [00:22:19]:
Yeah, exactly. Because I do like editorial calendars, but I am sometimes flying by the seat of my pants.

Amanda Page [00:22:27]:
But.

Liz Stapleton [00:22:29]:
I feel like an editorial calendar makes it easier to fly by the seat of your pants because you've got, like, a fallback. So you can take those ideas that you've had and put them into an editorial calendar and then not use it. Be like, I actually want to write this post this week, even though it was slated for three weeks from now, or whatever, or actually this happened this week, and I think that makes more sense to do.

Amanda Page [00:22:52]:
Yeah, I think that's really important to think about. It's helpful to write out a list.

Amanda Page [00:22:58]:
Like, you can just write out 52 subjects.

Amanda Page [00:23:01]:
Right. And that is a way to start training your mind to think through this lens. So those subjects, what stories do I have about these subjects? Or if you've got titles in mind, like 52 is one a week for the entire year, and that's kind of a good benchmark to start with. And then it's a way to start.

Amanda Page [00:23:21]:
Thinking about it through the lens. Yeah, because it's just training your brain.

Liz Stapleton [00:22:00]:
So blogging is a whole skill set. So training your brain to be a storyteller, even if you're not naturally a storyteller.

Amanda Page [00:23:33]:
So training your brain to be a storyteller, even if you're not naturally a storyteller.

Liz Stapleton [00:23:36]:
Because I am not naturally a storyteller at all. I'm really bad at telling stories, actually. But the beauty no, I am, though. I feel like the beauty of blogging is you can write out a draft where you tell the story and you're like, whoa, that is really bad. Let me clean this up. You can find the good parts in it and clean it up and take out what's extra and not really necessary. And that's kind of the wonderful thing of playing around with it and testing.

Amanda Page [00:23:59]:
Out what's extra and not really necessary. And that's kind of the wonderful thing of playing around with it and testing.

Liz Stapleton [00:24:07]:
It is you become a better writer.

Amanda Page [00:24:10]:
The more you do it.

Amanda Page [00:24:11]:
Yeah, I think it's really important to note, too, to just kind of play it first. Otherwise you're going to suck the joy right out of it. If you put too much pressure on the post in the beginning, you're not.

Amanda Page [00:24:23]:
Going to create some kind of some.

Liz Stapleton [00:24:25]:
Of my very first posts. It's like if you don't look back at your very first post, like a year or two from now and cringe, you have not been writing enough.

Amanda Page [00:24:35]:
Oh, yeah.

Amanda Page [00:24:36]:
When I look back at my first couple of Dream Beyond Debt once or even the first three months, I'm like, who.

Amanda Page [00:24:40]:
I mean, who.

Amanda Page [00:24:45]:
I was teaching.

Liz Stapleton [00:24:46]:
Delete them later too, guys. Or just go back and redo them and then republish them.

Amanda Page [00:24:52]:
Well, and I should say that too. There are tons of resources. I mean, I teach live storytelling in a course and narrative structure, so there's.

Amanda Page [00:25:02]:
Plenty of that out there.

Amanda Page [00:25:04]:
If you think, oh, I'm a terrible storyteller. Well, there are tips. There are tips. And I can leave many resources in the notes on this because.

Liz Stapleton [00:25:16]:
They'Re good.

Amanda Page [00:24:06]:
They're good t hings to keep in mind.

Liz Stapleton [00:25:21]:
Yeah, absolutely. The best thing is blogging. Nothing really permanent, so just tell the story, hit, publish, think of your next one or your next list with a story element to it and keep going because the more you do it, the better you'll get. And you can always go if you are strapped for time, instead of throwing out a junk post, go back to one of your very first ones, read it, cringe a little bit, and then be like, hey, how can I make this better? And then republish that. Because at least there's a personable element to it that a junk post of 15 side hustles that everyone has in.

Amanda Page [00:25:57]:
Fact heard of is not going to do. Yeah, those posts make me sad.

Amanda Page [00:26:06]:
Junk posts make me sad.

Liz Stapleton [00:26:08]:
Yeah, so don't create junk.

Amanda Page [00:26:11]:
I know you're here because you are.

Liz Stapleton [00:25:17]:
I know you're here because you are here because you're a quality blogger that wants to build content, because you do, literally. She is a professor, guys, at a school where she teaches writing.

Amanda Page [00:26:24]:
So.

Liz Stapleton [00:26:27]:
As a teacher, what are things you see people struggle with when it comes to writing that could maybe help.

Amanda Page [00:26:33]:
Especially oh, goodness, getting started. The drafting process. No one wants to go through that.

Amanda Page [00:26:38]:
Process.

Amanda Page [00:26:41]:
And there's no avoiding it. But one thing that I will say about the drafting process and blogging is.

Amanda Page [00:26:49]:
That all of my blog posts were first drafts.

Amanda Page [00:26:54]:
And I can see even and I meant to do this a long time ago, but I can see there are.

Amanda Page [00:27:00]:
Like three posts that I have that.

Amanda Page [00:27:02]:
You can see me working out the same idea and what the final product was.

Amanda Page [00:27:10]:
And I think that can exist in.

Amanda Page [00:27:13]:
A blog, but it can also exist. You've got to give yourself time for the drafting process and that can include brainstorming outlining all that. Just what structure do I want this to adhere to? What's a great first line.

Amanda Page [00:27:28]:
All that doesn't come straight from the beginning.

Liz Stapleton [00:27:32]:
Give yourself permission to just write a crappy.

Amanda Page [00:27:34]:
Yeah, absolutely.

Amanda Page [00:27:38]:
The other thing that I think I see a lot of struggle with is integration of outside material, like just attributing to other people. Although I tell a lot of personal stories, I make a ton of references.

Amanda Page [00:27:51]:
In my work and I think that.

Amanda Page [00:26:22]:
It's important just to be like, hey, according to so and so, according to so and so, or I read once on this blog that it's just, like throwing out casual references. There's a way to do that that's.

Amanda Page [00:28:05]:
Not academic and kind of boring.

Liz Stapleton [00:28:09]:
Yeah, I got the idea to use breakthrough from you, and I reached out to you. I was like, Is it okay if I do that? And you were like, yeah, absolutely. I'm so upset. I had, like, perfect lighting because it was, like, rainy, but it was, like, light, and now the sun came out in the blind. But anyway and it's okay if you've.

Amanda Page [00:28:30]:
Been just don't steal.

Liz Stapleton [00:28:04]:
Been just don't steal. We've got copyright and stuff being covered in another session, but throw attribute people.

Amanda Page [00:28:40]:
Where it's a full attribute stats or.

Liz Stapleton [00:28:35]:
Where it's a full attribute stats or information that helps support your point or your idea. It just makes it that much more credible. And that is stuff Google likes. You don't have to write a scientific paper in order to do that.

Amanda Page [00:28:53]:
Paper in order to do that.

Liz Stapleton [00:28:53]:
And I definitely recommend you guys go read some of Amanda's stuff to better see, because I think she does things so good.

Amanda Page [00:28:58]:
Read some of Amanda's stuff to better see, because I think she does things so good.

Liz Stapleton [00:29:04]:
I look forward to her emails, even though she really does aim more towards people who are writers. And I'm a blogger and I write, but I don't necessarily consider myself a writer. I have been one. I used to freelance.

Amanda Page [00:29:17]:
Right.

Liz Stapleton [00:29:17]:
Obviously.

Amanda Page [00:29:17]:
Yeah. I don't understand that.

Liz Stapleton [00:29:19]:
But I don't tend to think of myself as a writer because I was a math major. I have a math degree, not English.

Amanda Page [00:29:34]:
But I love her emails because the.

Liz Stapleton [00:29:01]:
But I love her emails because the stories and they're applicable to, like even though I'm not thinking about it in a writing sense, I'm thinking about it in more of a business sense or in a client sense or whatever.

Liz Stapleton [00:29:47]:
They'Re.

Liz Stapleton [00:29:42]:
They're fantastic examples of how do you connect. Even if it's not even the same subject. Thank you.

Amanda Page [00:29:51]:
Even if it's not even the same subject. Thank you.

Amanda Page [00:29:56]:
Yeah, I think of my emails kind of as personal development for writers. But writing, it is so broad. Right? It's so broad. And I think about it in terms.

Amanda Page [00:30:08]:
Of I mean, I know a lot.

Amanda Page [00:30:10]:
Of people who wouldn't consider themselves writers who are making their living as a writer, you know what I mean? Hold on, where does this come from?

Amanda Page [00:30:18]:
Like, deep, deep cultural conditioning.

Amanda Page [00:30:24]:
Yeah, I have a sense of who.

Amanda Page [00:30:27]:
My audience is just, again, from growing.

Amanda Page [00:30:31]:
The list and talking to people and asking for replies.

Liz Stapleton [00:29:52]:
Go to conferences, talking to people, talking to them. You and I met at a conference, the first Blogging conference I ever went to.

Amanda Page [00:30:45]:
And here we are, like five, six, five years later ish I was like, when was that?

Liz Stapleton [00:30:44]:
And here we are, like five, six, five years later ish I was like, when was that? And you're still someone I go to. I'm like, hey, what do you think of this idea? It can really help because sometimes your audience is like, lurkers and they're not actually talking yet. So talking to other people, bloggers even.

Amanda Page [00:31:10]:
Can really help in terms of getting.

Liz Stapleton [00:31:07]:
Can really help in terms of getting. Those ideas or just bouncing off because you can get.

Amanda Page [00:31:17]:
So stuck in just a debate with.

Liz Stapleton [00:31:15]:
So stuck in just a debate with yourself and then you ask the one they're like. Yeah, that one easy decision made.

Amanda Page [00:31:27]:
So, yeah, go to conferences, go hang.

Liz Stapleton [00:31:23]:
So, yeah, go to conferences, go hang out with other people at the summit.

Amanda Page [00:31:31]:
Right. We're going to have some sort of.

Liz Stapleton [00:31:30]:
Right. We're going to have some sort of Community group for you guys during the summit. But the comments section of these two can be a great way to connect and get ideas and ask questions like we started out. It always comes back to what story are you telling with whatever piece of content that makes it different from all the other blogs in the same topic as you.

Amanda Page [00:31:55]:
Yeah, and I think that's important too.

Amanda Page [00:32:00]:
To say, read widely. I was reading 15 blogs a day, and not always the same. Like the next day. It might be 15 more.

Amanda Page [00:32:10]:
The personal finance sphere is very large.

Amanda Page [00:32:14]:
Yeah, but read widely and connect widely. I was making a point in the beginning to comment on two blogs a day. Sometimes it'd be more, but always two.

Amanda Page [00:32:28]:
And to make those.

Liz Stapleton [00:32:31]:
I would only.

Amanda Page [00:31:59]:
I would only comment on the stories that I was connected to and it wasn't hard to find two of those a day. But yeah, read widely I think is important too, just so you have things.

Amanda Page [00:32:42]:
To reference and that also helps you.

Amanda Page [00:32:46]:
You just kind of like organically start to understand story structure and how to do this better.

Amanda Page [00:32:51]:
Yeah. So if you got writer's block, you're struggling looking at a blank page, go read something.

Liz Stapleton [00:32:40]:
Yeah. So if you got writer's block, you're struggling looking at a blank page, go read something. Yeah. Never fail.

Amanda Page [00:33:01]:
Yeah, absolutely. Read.

Liz Stapleton [00:33:04]:
Don't watch. That's a little bit different because you're.

Amanda Page [00:33:06]:
Not creating locked in. If you start watching, next thing you know, you're sending your friends memes for days.

Amanda Page [00:33:13]:
So, yeah, don't do that.

Liz Stapleton [00:33:14]:
Yeah.

Amanda Page [00:33:17]:
Look forward to getting those.

Liz Stapleton [00:33:20]:
But yeah, so no, I think it all comes back to telling a story. And if you're struggling with how to.

Amanda Page [00:33:25]:
Do it, look at Amanda stuff first, but also just see start looking at.

Liz Stapleton [00:32:57]:
Do it, look at Amanda stuff first, but also just see start looking at. The bloggers who you read and you enjoy going to and looking at taking a step back, not just from the story, but being like, hey, how are they weaving the story? And that this is why I like it. And kind of just take that step back and see what people you like are doing and why it is that you like that. And it will help, I think, to.

Amanda Page [00:33:51]:
Inform your own writing.

Liz Stapleton [00:33:50]:
Inform your own writing. 100%. Okay.

Liz Stapleton [00:33:56]:
Any final words or thoughts or tips.

Amanda Page [00:34:00]:
Actions they should take?

Amanda Page [00:34:04]:
No, I think we covered it because I really do, just to kind of recap, make those lists in the beginning.

Amanda Page [00:34:12]:
Just start playing on the page, pulling.

Amanda Page [00:34:16]:
Out things that you address.

Amanda Page [00:34:18]:
Guys, it doesn't be perfect.

Amanda Page [00:34:21]:
Yeah. And you know what some of your good stories are, right?

Amanda Page [00:34:24]:
Like, you already know. And I say talk to your people.

Amanda Page [00:34:29]:
But I also asked my friends once.

Amanda Page [00:34:32]:
There was an essay contest on the.

Amanda Page [00:34:36]:
Story of your life, and it was like, what's the one defining story of your life. So I asked three different friends of.

Liz Stapleton [00:34:40]:
Mine, hey, what do you think the.

Amanda Page [00:34:42]:
Defining story of my life is?

Amanda Page [00:34:43]:
And they came back with three different.

Amanda Page [00:34:45]:
Things to say this, but yeah, it's embarrassing to say that they each came back with a different public vomit story.

Amanda Page [00:34:50]:
And I was like, that's not how.

Amanda Page [00:34:54]:
I define my life. Those are the stories that they love to hear. So I don't know, maybe there's something in that. But also just in asking them, I never tell public vomit stories anymore, but I tell that story of the time that I asked three friends about what the story of my life is, and they came back with three different instances of me embarrassing myself in public.

Amanda Page [00:35:17]:
There's something to that.

Amanda Page [00:35:18]:
There's something under that story.

Amanda Page [00:35:19]:
Yeah, for sure.

Liz Stapleton [00:33:51]:
Yeah, for sure. When you talk to your people, we're not just saying talk to your audience, because your audience may not be speaking up yet, but talk to bloggers you.

Amanda Page [00:35:26]:
Up yet, but talk to bloggers you.

Liz Stapleton [00:35:28]:
Admire, communities, your friends, your family, they may not understand blogging, and they may look at you funny for doing a blog, because they don't understand it. But they understand stories, and they understand, I want to be able to tell a story.

Amanda Page [00:35:44]:
How do you think this sounds?

Liz Stapleton [00:35:26]:
How do you think this sounds? They can help in that regard because, yes, my family, I've been doing this Five years, and they still don't like what but they can understand a story.

Amanda Page [00:35:49]:
Five years, and they still don't like what but they can understand a story.

Liz Stapleton [00:35:56]:
And they give you feedback and ideas for stories, too.

Amanda Page [00:36:00]:
Yeah, 100%. That's the thing. You can ask your friends, hey, what do you think my best stories are? And you don't always have to agree, but you have to learn from what they've told you.

Liz Stapleton [00:36:11]:
Yeah. Don't be defensive about it.

Amanda Page [00:36:13]:
That's make life unhappy.

Amanda Page [00:36:16]:
Yeah, I do want to say, too, because this really helped me. A few years ago, I was talking to a friend of mine, and we were talking about being in a writer's group, and he said something about how it can be like an echo chamber. And he's the one I have a piece that you can link to below about.

Amanda Page [00:36:31]:
He was talking about going to open.

Amanda Page [00:36:33]:
Mics for a real audience. And although you may think that may.

Amanda Page [00:36:37]:
Not be the same as blogging, I.

Amanda Page [00:36:40]:
Know I have taken pieces that I drafted in my folder or drafted in WordPress to something and been like, I have this, and this is what I'm going to read. And pieces have become other things.

Amanda Page [00:36:53]:
So that can be really helpful, too.

Liz Stapleton [00:36:56]:
Yeah, and it is like, blogging is kind of like doing an open mic night. You're just doing it from behind a computer screen.

Liz Stapleton [00:37:04]:
Yeah, that's a great point. Yeah.

Liz Stapleton [00:37:08]:
And test it out. You could always actually go to a real open mic night if you're worried.

Amanda Page [00:37:12]:
About it's good to take things in front of other audiences. Like I said, sometimes you can just get into an echo chamber. It's good to talk to other bloggers.

Amanda Page [00:37:19]:
But also non bloggers.

Liz Stapleton [00:37:22]:
Yes.

Amanda Page [00:37:26]:
You don't stay too, in the world of people who are doing what you're.

Amanda Page [00:37:31]:
Doing because you've got to have outside.

Liz Stapleton [00:37:35]:
It becomes a back references and yeah.

Liz Stapleton [00:35:53]:
You've just yeah, you've got to keep.

Amanda Page [00:37:40]:
It interesting and layered.

Liz Stapleton [00:37:42]:
Yes. Awesome.

Liz Stapleton [00:37:43]:
Well, I think that is a lot of food for thought for people and gives them some ideas of how, especially.

Amanda Page [00:37:49]:
As new bloggers, to write.

Liz Stapleton [00:37:37]:
As new bloggers, to write. Don't stress about all the technical stuff. Just tell a story and you'll get.

Amanda Page [00:37:59]:
There with the rest.

Liz Stapleton [00:38:05]:
All right.

Amanda Page [00:38:05]:
Awesome.
