Alright, guys. I'm really excited for this next session because we're going to be talking about marketing as a whole, which is something that I struggle with myself. So, our speaker is the founder of Dash of Social, it's a content marketing firm specializing in social media marketing strategy, blogging and email marketing. Working closely with their clients, our wonderful speaker Ashley and her team help small business owners and entrepreneurs craft and execute value-driven marketing strategies designed to establish thought leadership, grow online communities, and build connections and leads. So, Ashley, thank you so much for coming on here. I can't wait to ask you all the questions.

[00:00:45.010] - Ashley
Yeah, thank you for having me, Liz.

[00:00:47.810] - Liz
Yeah, so kind of the topic you propose was you know value-driven marketing, and so I think there you have to then start with values. Because I know when you start blogging, you may not realize that you have certain values associated with your blog, you haven't put them to word. How do you suggest people kind of think on that and figure out exactly what their values are to be able to then work on marketing?

[00:01:14.980] - Ashley
Yes, that's a great idea. So, I always encourage clients to think of their overall content pillars which do align with their values. So, really being able to think of about three to five main topic categories that they would be incorporating into their overall marketing. So ,whether it's personal content, whether it's tips, whether it's videos, really being able to outline the methods and content umbrella ultimately that they'll be using to really plan out their content marketing plan. So, one thing that I always say to clients specifically is that your marketing content in general, regardless of what method you use to deliver it, should always focus on providing value. You should provide value and you should serve your audience in some way. So, whether that's being able to educate them on something, whether that's being able to just get them to know a little bit about who you are and building that, you know like and trust factor, you always want to make sure that you're delivering something to them so that they get something out of it.

[00:02:16.460] - Liz
Okay, so we knew, because I think a lot of people struggle with that of like, well, if I'm giving everything away, how can I make this a business? So, can you provide me some examples of value without you know kind of, you know,  harming the business side of things?

[00:02:35.110] - Ashley
That's a great question and something that I've also gotten asked as well. And what I say is that you can give people all of the information in the world, but whether or not they implement it is a whole other thing. So, what often happens is that you might give people a bunch of awesome tips on how to do something that relates to your business, but they'll end up following those tips, trying to get through it and then realize, oh shoot, this takes way too much time than I thought. And I also don't know how to do this, but now I'm going to hire such person to do this for me. And so, having that mindset is huge because it really helps to portray you as the expert and they're going to really appreciate the fact that you gave them all of this free information. And then when they realize that they can't do it themselves, you're going to be the first person they think of to outsource it to.

[00:03:24.060] - Liz
Yeah, and I will say because I know with the summit, a lot of information, like, you guys are going to end up with so many ideas. I see it happen every year. Make sure you attend the implementation workshop on Friday to come up with a plan to tackle it. And then you might realize when you're tackling it, you need to hire out, in which case go look at our speakers. But definitely, that will help you guys to take action because you're right, you can attend every single session, get all the information, and then do nothing. And that's the worst.

[00:03:49.590] - Ashley
Exactly.

[00:03:51.340] - Liz
Okay. So, when you're coming up with a marketing ecosystem, because it is a lot moving parts, and I've got to say I'm totally guilty of like, not doing social media, like bare minimum, if not less than that in reality. Like I've always focused on email marketing and creating blog content. I'm trying to slowly build up my YouTube. But like, how do you create like, just something that kind of sustains itself, right? Like, that's kind of what an ecosystem is.

[00:04:21.610] - Ashley
Yeah, great question. So, I think there's a few parts to it. So one, making sure that you're using more than one marketing initiative or method, so not just focusing on only social media, but making sure you're using all of the components that go into that ecosystem. Such as social media, email marketing, having a website, being able to, like you said, create videos, whatever it may be. But then also I say it's really best to be able to batch plan your content. If you just spend a few hours at the start of each month, whether it's on a Friday if that tends to be a slower day of the week for you. Or even if you just spend a Saturday just knocking it all out at once. Being able to just kind of take a few hours to plan everything, whether it's writing your social media posts, writing blog posts and scheduling them, or writing out a newsletter. Then it's kind of like a "set it and forget it" type of deal where you can just do it all at once, schedule it, and then you know it's done. That kind of really helps to take the pressure off because what I often see with business owners or bloggers is they might say, I'll just write the post tomorrow, and they try to do it day by day.

[00:05:27.370] - Ashley
But then what happens is they end up going months without anything getting posted because they just truly get busy. And so it's best to make sure that you are setting that time to be able to plan things out. So that way you know that your content is created, it's scheduled and it's getting published, and people aren't going to your profile, to your website and seeing tumbleweeds rolling by because it's been so long since you last shared an update.

[00:05:50.290] - Liz
Yes. So, I do batch. I've gotten into a bit of trouble myself lately because I like to batch excessive amounts, which I'm going to have to adjust that because now I'm a little bit troubled. But part of the reason I struggle too is, life happened.

[00:06:08.400] - Ashley
right.

[00:06:08.860] - Liz
And like really threw me off everything. So, I mean even if you're doing just a month at a time, which I think is totally doable, and I think it's a great approach and it might be one I have to go back to. Do you have any tips for you know if something happens, life happens and you're not able to get that batching day at the beginning of the month or the end of the month or whatever, of managing that and keeping things going at least for that month?

[00:06:34.460] - Ashley
Yes. So, a lot of social media schedulers, like the social media scheduler I use, which is smarter queue, with social media specifically, they have like an evergreen option, which is amazing. So, basically what you can do is you can write a bunch of social media posts but add them into this evergreen queue. You can set up a certain cycle so that way the post ultimately gets recycled and republished for whatever timeframe you want, whether it's once every three weeks or once every week, whatever you'd like to set it as, it's an amazing feature to take advantage of. So that way when things like that happen, when life gets crazy, you know that you have a content bank built up and you're not going to have to go and create new posts all the time. You can just have your scheduler pull from things that you've already planned.

[00:07:19.260] - Liz
And then that could actually probably apply to older blog content to just republish it.

[00:07:24.720] - Ashley
Yeah, exactly. That's one thing that I always recommend people do is update at least one blog post per month. Usually, I start with the oldest blog post so that way, you can update any old stats. If you have a fresh perspective on the topic, you can include that, it kind of prevents you from having to reinvent the wheel, so to say, and just be able to take something you've already written and maybe spend 20-30 minutes tops, going through and updating it as you see fit.

[00:07:50.590] - Liz
Okay. The next thing I want to kind of ask you about because I feel like it's becoming more and more prevalent in the online space is the use of AI because it can really speed things up to a certain extent. What is kind of your view on, is it useful tool? How should people be using it, so it's useful or not? You know because it can be really unuseful too but you know wjust kind of your thoughts on that?

[00:08:14.190] - Ashley
I think it can be helpful with automating but what I will say is that you have to definitely pay really close attention to what it produces. Especially with, I can't remember the name of it but I've used like an AI copywriting type of software before and the type of text that it created just didn't really seem very English, so to say, it was kind of like taking things very literally, and especially if you're writing in a more personal voice, I think that stuff gets lost in translation. And so even though it can totally help you with speeding up the content creation process, you definitely need to make sure you're keeping a close eye on it to make sure that nothing's slipping through the cracks. So, I think it's really helpful to be able to do that. One other software that I use that I guess I would consider it to be AI is Descript which is amazing. I use it for a podcast that I'm going to be launching but it's really helpful for being able to transcribe the episodes. And so again, one thing that I have to do with that is go through and double-check all of the transcription that it's pulled together because sometimes the words are just completely off based on the way that it picks up the audio.

[00:09:20.920] - Ashley
So, it is helpful in that case because otherwise, I'd be spending hours listening to the episode and typing it. But that in that sense is huge of being able to use it.

[00:09:31.690] - Liz
Okay, so I was wondering if you could maybe give an example of like value-driven marketing ecosystem of like, if this is your post and this is how you kind of pull all the pieces in.

[00:09:44.470] - Ashley
Yes. So, I like to start at the higher level or the bigger piece of content which is a blog post, typically anywhere from 750 to maybe 1500 words, give or take. With that, you have your long-form piece of content but then you want to find ways that you can repurpose it across all of the other channels. So, from that one blog post, you can pull up multiple bitesized, social media posts from it. From that one blog post you can perhaps film a short video about the topic that might be three to five minutes long, just kind of verbally sharing what it is and explaining the topic further. From that, you can also leave a link to the blog post and the newsletter that you send out and promote it that way. I mean there's so many different options that you can include. Really all that entails is making sure that you're educating your audience in some way or serving them in some way through a piece of content and making sure that you're ultimately promoting it, sharing it, and repurposing it throughout all the other channels that you have in your hands.

[00:10:43.840] - Liz
Okay. So, if you've got a blog post that you've just finished writing, do you then work on pulling out all the other pieces, or do you come back to it later?

[00:10:51.790] - Ashley
I usually pull all the other pieces out at once while it's still fresh in my head, and then I kind of just make sure that I have all of the pieces completed and done, so that way it's something I don't have to go back to.

[00:11:02.610] - Liz
Okay, what are some mistakes you see people making when it comes to trying to repurpose that content or to you know create an ecosystem?

[00:11:12.110] - Ashley
I think people tend to focus a little bit more on one medium over another. Specifically, like, we're talking about social media, generally, everyone's honing in on Instagram, and they tend to kind of forget about or discount the other platforms that are available, such as Facebook. Everyone is always so quick to kind of knock on Facebook, which I can totally understand, but for someone like me, where most of my clients come from Facebook, you really need to not discount something just because of what you're hearing other people say about it. You need to make sure that it really works for your audience, whether it's readers that you want to drive to your blog, or if you own a business, whether it's clients or customers that you want to get, make sure that you're prioritizing and researching that. And then I think also too, being able to kind of give a fresh perspective when repurposing. So, even though it is good to be able to reshare stuff you've already created, I think if there's a way to spin the post in a way where it can seem like something brand new, that might help to make your audience realize or think that it's something that they haven't seen before.

[00:12:15.340] - Liz
Yeah, because even if they've seen it, they may not have read the whole thing because people's attention spans are pretty short these days.

[00:12:21.820] - Ashley
Exactly.

[00:12:22.720] - Liz
Heck, the first year of the summit sessions were like an hour long, and now they're like ten minutes, so. Anyway, so, okay, we talked about kind of you know the value you're providing in terms of your content pillars and your topic categories. When you say provide value deliver, is that just like, hey, give them an action step? Is that, you know how clear are you in the like, here's this thing?

[00:12:50.770] - Ashley
So, I think it can depend on the content and the topic, but ultimately, you want someone to read whatever you're creating and have some type of takeaway. Whether it's a tip that they try to implement, whether you share a blog post that they want to go and read, whether you share a lead magnet or a free resource that they download and they're able to use to kind of guide them through something. You want to give them some type of clear action or step that they are able to take that will ultimately improve their life, their blog, or their business. That's ultimately the goal with the content that you create is you want to inspire someone and you want to encourage them to take action.

[00:13:25.610] - Liz
Okay. Follow up to that question, because basically what you're talking about is having a clear call to action, which is shorthand CTA often referred to that way. How do you decide what the CTA should be?

[00:13:37.990] - Ashley
I would say depend on what your goals are. So, if you want to get people to sign up for your email list, that call to action should be to download your free resource and sign up to receive it. If you want to drive website traffic, the goal should be to send people to a blog post or to another page on your website. If you want people to leave a comment, you can literally say that leave a comment in the comment section below with your thoughts. I think it just all depends on what you hope to get out of it and then making sure you continue to ask people for it. And speaking of that, it's one thing I always say to my clients, is that being able to get people to take action on it is like the same thing as being a parent. So, I say, how many times do you have to ask your kid to do something before they actually do it? And I always say to people, you have to continuously ask before someone actually does that thing. And so even though it may feel to you annoying or tedious to constantly be including the same call to action, you have to do it because the chance of the person actually doing it the first time is super slim.

[00:14:40.080] - Liz
Oh, my gosh. Like, yes. I've never thought about it that way, but I'm like, yeah, as like, you know, now I was arguing with my niece. You have to eat lunch. Why do we eat?

[00:14:51.720] - Ashley
Right?

[00:14:53.290] - Liz
And I was like because you need energy for practice. I'm not hungry, I don't. The only thing I want to eat, you won't make me.

[00:14:59.960] - Ashley
Oh, my gosh. I know.

[00:15:04.760] - Liz
Exactly [crosstalk 00:15:05].

[00:15:05.300] - Ashley
And like the first time I said that to a client, he was like, oh my God, you're right. And I'm like, exactly.

[00:15:11.890] - Liz
Oh, that is just like perfect. Okay. So, obviously, so, your call to action is going to depend on your goals. How do you balance when you have multiple goals? Right? Like, how often are you switching between different calls to action to, A, keep it fresh but also reach different goals? Like how does that balance work?

[00:15:31.090] - Ashley
I think it would depend on the season of your business or blog. So, say if you're in the season of launching something, your goal might be at that time to build your email list. So that way you have more subscribers on your list when it comes time to announce the launch of whatever it is to your audience. If things tend to be a little bit slower in the season, and maybe you just want to focus on building up some followers. That goal, you'd be creating content that helps you to reach that ultimately, but I think it kind of depends on what you're looking to do at that time and it can change over time, which is okay. As you start to reach new goals, you might set bigger ones or maybe you are a little bit ambitious and are going to end up falling short in the goal that you originally set. It's absolutely okay to be able to change that as you go through and then think about ultimately reverse engineering it, thinking about what you need to do in order to reach those goals and the calls to action that will accommodate them.

[00:16:24.640] - Liz
Okay, so it's all well and good to have call to action to be, you know, marketing all the places. How do you see what's working? What are your tips for actually checking the data and having a way to easily see what's working and you know getting you towards your goals?

[00:16:43.390] - Ashley
Google analytics is huge. So making sure you set that up and see what your bounce rate is, how many clicks people had, how many subscribers came from that one landing page. It's helpful to kind of give you a good understanding. It's especially helpful too if you're promoting a certain lead magnet on social media and you can see that social media is doing its job of constantly driving people to the website, but they're not opting in. And so that's an indication to you that something needs to be fixed on that website in order to be able to capture the people who have shown interest in downloading the resource and convert them. So that's really helpful with kind of being able to identify problems that might be happening within your marketing and really being able to give you an inside look into what you need to adjust in order to help you reach those goals that you've set.

[00:17:36.110] - Liz
Okay. Just couple of follow ups to that because Google Analytics is insanely powerful if you can figure out how to use it.

[00:17:42.930] - Ashley
Right.

[00:17:43.440] - Liz
Beyond just installing it, right, because you can do goals, you can do. I'm just curious if you know of any good resources, you know, that can help people to better use Google Analytics or if you have any of those. I don't know, but just because it can be a beast, especially when you're trying to figure it out with the social media and you could do utms and is it converting, and yeah.

[00:18:05.020] - Ashley
Yeah. So I took it like a million years ago. But Google does have like some type of certification and courses and things like that that they share. But honestly, I say for me, what works well with getting to know any type of new platform is honestly just trying it. Like, I like to try things out and kind of get a feel for it because I feel like I could watch a video or read an article, but actually going ahead and trying it, I end up understanding it a little bit more. It's also helpful to perhaps hire a consultant. If you want to hire someone to set it up for you and then maybe do a session with them one on one to walk you through the process, that will definitely help to take some time off your hands.

[00:18:43.290] - Liz
Yes. Especially, they can just set it up so that you can just see the result, like the data.

[00:18:48.410] - Ashley
Exactly. Like I don't care how this is working. I just want to know what this stuff means.

[00:18:53.810] - Liz
Yes. Yes. Okay. Any final tips for someone who's struggling to kind of create a cohesive marketing plan?

[00:19:00.790] - Ashley
I say to start small, because that is a really big struggle that bloggers and business owners have is, they try to do all the things everywhere, all at once, and it gets really overwhelming, and depending on your schedule, might even seem impossible to do. So, people think that they need to be on every single social media platform that exists and be posting every single day. But with that, I say really understand who your target market is and what platforms they're using, and then hone in on those platforms. You can also start small with the amount of content that you create. So, even if you're just publishing one social media post per week, one newsletter per quarter, one blog post per month, that's okay, because you're still being consistent in showing up. And I always say that consistency is much more important and means more than frequency. So, once you really start to kind of get comfortable with all of these different moving parts and you feel good about it, then you can increase the frequency and start to post more often, or perhaps try a new marketing method or whatever it may be. But you definitely want to start small, because doing everything all at once, right off the bat is what will cause you to burn out and just drop it completely.

[00:20:11.210] - Liz
Awesome. Okay. Where can people learn more about you? Is there somewhere specific you want to send them?

[00:20:18.190] - Ashley
Yeah, absolutely. So, you can go to my website, which is Dashofsocial.com. On that website, you'll find a resource you can download, which is called Build Your Content Marketing Bank, which is super helpful to download and covers pretty much everything Liz and I just chatted about. You can also follow me along on social media at Dash of Social on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram.

[00:20:42.410] - Liz
Alright. Awesome. Guys, definitely, go check her out. I actually probably need to download that because, as I said, I am only doing small parts of marketing when I really should be doing more. So, Ashley, thank you so much. Appreciate you being here. And if people have questions, you know they can always find you, like you said, on social media or ask away in the comments, and we'll be sure to get you guys some answers.

[00:21:03.330] - Ashley
Awesome. Thank you, Liz.
