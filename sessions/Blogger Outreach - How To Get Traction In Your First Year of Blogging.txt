[00:00:09.400] - Liz Stapleton, Summit Host
All right, guys, I'm excited to have Rob Powell back again. He was one of our speakers last year at the 2020 summit. Rob, thank you again for joining us to talk about sort of SEO and growing your reach. Can you tell, for those that weren't here last year, tell em a little bit about your background?

[00:00:25.960] - Rob Powell, robpowellbizblog.com
OK, well, thank you. First of all, thank you very much, Elizabeth, for having me back to speak at the Summit. So I'm a blogger, I guess, mainly in the SEO space. And I started, I think in early 2017. And it's a pretty competitive space I'm in. In retrospect, I probably wish I'd done niched down a little bit, but in the end, it's I guess it's what fires you up and. Yeah.

[00:00:58.450] - Rob
SEO, you know, I love that it's always evolving and I love that about it. But yeah.

[00:01:06.220] - Rob
So it's a very competitive area, that space that I'm in. And yeah, I think the problem is to differentiate yourself from all the other voices out there. It's a big challenge. I've just started accepting guest posts in the last six months. So in the last three or four months, that's been a big change at my end. For ages, I was really worried what that would, what the SEO impact of that. I've started a YouTube channel, but I've been pretty slack about that and that's one of my resolutions is to be more consistent about...

[00:01:41.230] - Liz
Well, you should attend the YouTube sessions. All right, so let's go ahead and dive in, because, I mean, we're recording this at the end of 2020, and 2020 has been unexpected. I think at the very least we could say, of the way the year's gone.

[00:01:53.560] - Rob
Absolutely.

[00:01:53.660] - Liz
And so a lot of people had to learn how to work from home and now are maybe exploring the idea of an online business because of the flexibility it provides. So if someone is starting a blog right now, you know, what should they do to get traffic? Because there's lots of people doing it.

[00:02:08.200] - Rob
Yeah, well, I really believe in organic search. I really believe in free, free Google traffic. But there is a bit of a delay, a bit of a lead-in time for that. Partly because if you're starting off new your website doesn't have any backlinks and also because there's a thing called the Sandbox Effect where Google actually prevents you from appearing in the results for somewhere from three to six months.

[00:02:43.540] - Rob
So basically, during that time, Google wants to see what kind of website you are and establish your bona fides before showing you in the results. And that's a problem for many websites. So in that time, when you're waiting for organic search to kick in, there are two things that I really recommend people do. One of them is to write roundup posts and the other is to write top list posts.

[00:03:11.860] - Liz
OK, so what are roundup posts? Are they specifically of experts? If you can explain what a roundup post is, that will drive traffic. Because you can do roundups of your own posts that aren't going to do as much in those early days.

[00:03:26.800] - Rob
Yeah. So the roundup posts I'm talking about is where you invite anywhere from 20-50 experts in your niche to talk about a particular topic. The question you're going to ask them is very simple. So the quicker, the shorter it is for them to answer, the more likely they're going to participate.

[00:03:47.890] - Rob
So it could be, what's the one thing you would do differently if you were starting again? Or what are your three most important blogging tools? Or what's the most important tip you would give to a blogger starting out in 2021? So that's basically the form it takes. And there are two things that expert roundabout, sorry, expert roundups will do to help you get your blog off the ground. One is that the people you're interviewing usually have high domain authority and the other is that they most often have very large email lists and very large followings on social media.

[00:04:27.040] - Rob
So with the high domain authority, let's say your expert roundup has 45 contributors and only a third of them post a link to your roundup article. That's 15 high authority backlinks you've just earned for your website and that's going to help you rank on Google and with the email lists and the followings on social media. The same thing when they post your article or they share it on their social media accounts, you're basically tapping into their traffic, which is going to be pretty big. And that's because, by definition, influencers and experts have built up large email lists and large social media followings.

[00:05:03.340] - Liz
OK, so we talked about the expert roundup posts, but you also said we should be doing list posts. So what are they and how do they help you build traffic when you have a brand new blog?

[00:05:22.840] - Rob
Well, list posts, one of the reasons I like list posts, is they're much less work than a roundup post. So roundup post involves quite a lot of outreach and there's a lot of to-ing and fro-ing between the contributors and some end up not responding. And then you've got to keep track of who you've outreached to and where you're up to with each person. But a top list post is you're just doing your research and compiling a list of the top 30 or 50 influencers or experts in a particular niche. And you're making you're just compiling a list.

[00:05:56.500] - Rob
But you do need...So with a top list post, you do need a sort of a criteria for ranking them. That can be the number of followers they have, the number of views they have, the number of subscribers. If you've got access to income reports, it could be monthly income. It could be Alexa rank of their website or it could be monthly page views. And it could also be completely subjective.

[00:06:29.020] - Rob
So you can just list the experts or influencers that you like best, but if you do that, you just need to make sure that you explain to the reader what it is you like about what they do.

[00:06:40.180] - Liz
Yeah, because the more sort of organization there is to it, the easier it is for people to see and read and stay on the page, which also goes towards SEO. Correct?

[00:06:49.440] - Rob
Yeah, that's right. Well, actually, one of the reasons for the ranking is that, and this is what makes them so powerful in generating, like, I've done these and they get sort of five hundred shares on social media quite quickly. Top list posts feed into a sort of basic human tendency to want to receive recognition.

[00:07:10.210] - Rob
And yeah, we all have a desire to see ourselves listed on a list of the best performers in our niche.

[00:07:18.550] - Liz
Yeah.

[00:07:20.020] - Rob
And so that's where the ranking comes in. Yeah. So you really do need to I think, have a fairly objective way of ranking people. And that's why those things get shared because people want to say, "Hey, look, I was on this list."

[00:07:33.610] - Liz
Yeah, yeah. It's like an award, you know? I was, like, nominated for an award once and I was like, I'm a nominee. You know? X year of this award thing. I was the nominee, you know? Like I didn't win but they nominated me out of all these other people, so...

[00:07:49.950] - Rob
An interesting thing I've noticed is that the people who are going to share your top list, most are not the people at the top, it's the people in the bottom third because they are just absolutely thrilled to be on that list. And so, yeah, you get a lot of traction and they're just very easy to put together. They're really quick. Whereas roundup posts are quite a bit of work.

[00:08:14.380] - Liz
Yeah, herding cats a little bit there, trying to get everything organized.

[00:08:20.740] - Rob
Exactly.

[00:08:20.740] - Liz
And, you know, it's a little bit like trying to get 50 speakers for Summit.

[00:08:25.680] - Rob
Exactly.

[00:08:26.350] - Liz
Yeah, it is quite a lot of work. But yeah, like you said with the expert, if you, a really short, to the point question instead of like a long drawn out one that they can answer quickly and send off, like, that's going to work a lot better.

[00:08:39.130] - Rob
Absolutely. Yeah. Yeah.

[00:08:41.560] - Liz
OK, so thank you for that. Given everything that's going on in the world right now, do you think, I mean, because more people are looking at starting a blog, but do you think it's actually a good time to be starting?

[00:08:52.570] - Rob
Yeah, absolutely. You know, just I with this pandemic things, I don't think things are ever going to go back to the way exactly the way they were before and, you know, people in the travel industry, entertainment, anything with high public contact, those kind of sectors, people in those sectors have had to look for something new. And a lot of people, millions of people are now looking for something to do online. But even before the coronavirus came, there was already a very strong movement towards online learning.

[00:09:29.860] - Liz
Yeah.

[00:09:30.730] - Rob
So it seems that universities and colleges haven't been able to keep up with the pace of change and they're just not agile enough to respond quickly to changes in the marketplace. So even before the pandemic came, there was this enormous explosion in online learning. So there's just a huge demand for information, whether it's free in the form of a blog because that's basically free information or you've got a particular skill set that you can teach through an online course.

[00:10:07.560] - Liz
Digital products, yeah. So it is a good time. There is a lot of people looking and not just looking for jobs right there at home now, they have new hobbies that they're trying, you know, they want to explore. Or the kids are home and "OK, I need to find someone who has a blog on, what did they, how can I keep them busy all day?" There's you know, it doesn't necessarily have to be that you're like teaching something, like digital products. You know? It's a sharing of your knowledge, right? It doesn't necessarily teach and it can be a great way to start an online business, but also just to help people. Like it's a crazy time!

[00:10:45.840] - Liz
So I do want to ask you what's the single most important bit of advice you would give to someone just starting out right now?

[00:10:53.340] - Rob
Well, based on my own experience, looking back at it, I would really urge people to niche down. It's not that you can't succeed if you don't niche down, but it's just going to take you longer to breakthrough.

[00:11:08.190] - Rob
So what do I mean by niching down? I mean, I'm just pulling these examples out of the air. But for example, instead of having a website or blog about vintage cars, go for Italian vintage cars. Or instead of a blog about parenting tips, go for a blog about parenting tips for single dads. And instead of a blog about SEO, go for a blog that focuses on SEO for real estate agents. When when you niche down, what happens is, firstly you rank quicker on Google because there's less competition.

[00:11:46.020] - Rob
Secondly, you become seen as an expert in your field much quicker because you're not competing with so many big names. And thirdly, you identify your, you kind of identify your tribe much quicker.

[00:12:04.110] - Rob
So a single dad who arrives on a website that it's just parenting tips, it may have lots of information that's relevant to him. But if he arrives on a website that's called Parenting Tips for Single Dads, that's it. He's, he knows that you're talking about him.

[00:12:23.010] - Liz
Yeah.

[00:12:23.880] - Rob
So, yeah, the more you reach down, the more the people who arrive on your website are going to say this is exactly, this is me.

[00:12:31.380] - Liz
They're going to come back. They're going to engage. They're going to...

[00:12:34.540] - Rob
Yeah, yeah.

[00:12:36.120] - Rob
So that the more, the narrower your niche, it's not that, you know, people have got this terrible fear that there's not going to be...you know, the smaller the niche, the less the traffic. That's not really the big issue, the big issue...

[00:12:50.570] - Liz
It's the better quality of the traffic.

[00:12:52.660] - Rob
Yeah, that's right, exactly right. And people know, people need to know that you're talking to their issues, their problems.

[00:13:01.880] - Liz
If you're trying to write to everyone, you're not going to reach anyone. You've got to write to a person, you know?

[00:13:06.830] - Rob
Exactly.

[00:13:07.130] - Liz
Really narrow it down and it's not that other people can't get something from it too, they probably will, but the more specific you are, the better success you'll see has been my experience.

[00:13:18.080] - Rob
Yeah, absolutely. Yeah, yeah. 

[00:13:20.900] - Liz
