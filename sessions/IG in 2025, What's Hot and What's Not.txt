Cat Griffin [00:00:12]:
Hello, and welcome to my presentation. So just very very quickly, in case you don't know who I am, my name is Cat Griffin, and I became an accidental obsessor of Instagram around 8 years ago when I decided to make a bet with my husband that I would become a travel influencer. He found this hilarious and justifiably so, seeing as I hadn't even looked at Instagram at this point. So to say I was clueless is the understatement of the probably the decade, maybe century. But I did. I grew that travel account to a 100,000 followers and a bit more, and then I quickly became bored. Now my day job is I am a teacher. I teach at a university in South Korea.

Cat Griffin [00:01:01]:
So the natural next step for me was to help others teach others how to effectively use social media to grow their own businesses, their presence online, their blogs, and how to leverage it effectively. Now in today's presentation, I'm talking about Instagram, what's hot and what's not in 2025. The intention of this presentation is you want to use Instagram to grow your presence. You want to have a presence on Instagram, but you don't want you know, you don't have hours and hours to spend on it every day. It's a realistic look at how to use Instagram to grow your presence online. It's not a this is going to be your be all and end all. I just want to make that clear from the start, my goal is not to overwhelm you with how to use Instagram. So the first thing I want to say is remember your audience.

Cat Griffin [00:02:02]:
So regardless of anything I say throughout this presentation, it's your audience that want to

Cat Griffin [00:02:07]:
be at the heart of any practices, any decisions, any strategy that you use on Instagram. So I'm going

Cat Griffin [00:02:16]:
to say the dreaded algorithm word, but what actually drives the algorithm is your audience and what your audience want from you, what they enjoy from you. If you are making content that your audience enjoy and consume and find valuable, it doesn't matter if that content is a static image post. It doesn't matter if that is a highly edited reel. It doesn't matter if it's a beautiful carousel. If you are creating content that your audience enjoy, are consuming, are engaging with, then the algorithm will show that content to your audience, and it will show it to lookalike audiences too. This is where I put on my teacher hat and become a little bit stern. It's really important because of this then that you don't engage in any kind of fake following, fake engagement. Even things like dropping your Instagram handle in follow for follow threads can be harmful for you in the algorithm because it creates a fake audience for Instagram to follow.

Cat Griffin [00:03:29]:
So not does it just mean that your content will be shown to the wrong audience, people aren't your target audience, It will also end up limiting your reach on Instagram because people aren't engaging your content because it's being shown to the wrong audience. They don't like it, but Instagram doesn't know it's a wrong audience because it's using the data that you have given it. So everything that you do on the platform, you want to be organic. You want to be genuine. But at the heart of it is you want it to be content for your audience. And also remember who you are. Your audience want to get to know you through the platform. If people are checking you out on socials, it's because they're expecting to see the human side, the personal side, the know the person behind the business, behind the brand.

Cat Griffin [00:04:23]:
And I'm not saying that you need to share all your private personal information. You don't. You can still, share as much or as little of that as you want. But you do need to have your personality, your values, your your visions, your your aspirations, all of those kind of things your audience are going to want to see from you on the platform. Now following on from that, then I do want to just introduce you to the concept of the evergreen, first of all.

Cat Griffin [00:04:56]:
So the evergreen feed. So the evergreen feed is if you

Cat Griffin [00:05:03]:
know that you don't want to be active on Instagram, but you know that your audience are going to look for you on Instagram. So about 80% of people actually do go and look for a business on Instagram before they make a purchase. Now you might not have the time to be on Instagram. It might not be the platform that you really want to be active on. An evergreen feed is a perfect solution to this. It's basically a static 9 grid or 12 grid feed that very quickly allows people to find out about you and your business, your blog. Not quite at a glance, but very quickly visually, and all the important information is there for them to very easily find. Some people do use an evergreen feed if they're creating reels as well.

Cat Griffin [00:05:55]:
I teach not to do that. I teach if you are going to create reels, then you should have those reels on your feed. You shouldn't hide those behind an evergreen feed. Because if you're creating reels that people like, then they're going to follow you for that. People are genuinely not going to follow you because of an evergreen feed, but it is a source of information. It's a place where people can find out about your business quite easily. So just to recap that, an evergreen feed is great if you know your audience are going to look for you on Instagram, but you don't want to spend time creating content. It does come into caveat though you are going to grow a following on Instagram or not a significant following on Instagram to an evergreen feed because you're not creating new content that's going to be being pushed out to new people for people to find you.

Cat Griffin [00:06:55]:
Now I do want to just sort of go back to your audience, and we always talk about you need to be on the platform where your audience are active. Your audience might be active on the platform but your content your content type might not be what they want on Instagram. So for example, I need an accountant. I will look on Instagram to check out about an accountant that

Cat Griffin [00:07:24]:
I'm interested in, but I'm never going to follow an account on Instagram because I

Cat Griffin [00:07:29]:
have no desire to see that content showing on my feed. If that is what you do not I mean, maybe you are an accountant. But if what you do is something that isn't content that people are necessarily going to want to keep following, be engaged with on the on Instagram, again, the evergreen feed is a perfect solution.

Cat Griffin [00:07:52]:
Not only are you not wasting your time creating content, but you've got

Cat Griffin [00:07:56]:
a very solid place that when people do go and look to find out about you, it is all there. So you've got the presence without doing all the work.

Cat Griffin [00:08:08]:
Alright. So moving on, I mentioned reels already. Let's talk about reels. So reels aren't going anywhere. Now you might love creating reels, and that's fantastic. You might hate creating reels and that's also okay. What I do

Cat Griffin [00:08:28]:
want to share is if you are creating reels, again remember who your audience are. Don't just necessarily chase going viral with a reel. You want to make sure that your reel is delivering value, is speaking directly to your target audience. It's not about the number of views on a reel. It's about whether or not those views are reaching the right people. And if you are very very niche, then it is a very niche audience that you want to reach. Maybe you do have a very broad audience, in which case, then, yes, going bright going viral will be an effective strategy for you. But the ability to actually go viral, a lot of that comes down to luck.

Cat Griffin [00:09:21]:
It's not something yes. You can strategize. Yes. You can have engaging content. Yes. You can have content that's interesting and has transitions and has great music, and all of these things help. But there is also an element of luck factor there too. So without spending all your time worrying about everything being perfect, spend your time worrying about, is this content that will value will give value to my audience, my audience will want to see.

Cat Griffin [00:09:55]:
Now there are a lot of low effort reels. So if you're like, yes. My audience do like reels. I don't love being on camera, or I don't have the time to shoot a lot of reels,

Cat Griffin [00:10:08]:
I don't have the space in my home, any of these things. There are a lot of low effort reels that you can create. So you

Cat Griffin [00:10:16]:
can use b roll content, and you can either create your own, or if

Cat Griffin [00:10:20]:
you're using something like Canva or maybe you've got a stock, a video content subscription. And b roll content is things like when you

Cat Griffin [00:10:31]:
see a coffee cup being stirred, or you see panning across the ocean, or leaves being kicked up as somebody's walking. That kind of content, which you can then overlay with text information. And you can reuse this b roll content multiple times. You can be shooting this yourself. You know, if you're going out in the autumn, fall leaves, you could make pick up some leaves yourself. If you're at a beautiful location, you can shoot a quick panning video, or there is tons of videos available on places like Canva that you can use and quickly put text as an overlay on there. You can just simply talk to the camera. You don't need to worry about all the fancy transitions and quick costume changes and all that.

Cat Griffin [00:11:27]:
If you've got something you know your audience want to hear, just talk to them about it directly through the camera. Don't worry about all the fancy editing and everything if you don't want to. You can also use things like writing on post it notes or taking post it notes away. You can even just film writing or typing or screen records. These are all low effort ways that you can use video to communicate with your audience, and you can even actually use a carousel and make that into a reel. So if you've got a carousel post and you add music to that fur first post on the carousel, that automatically means that it will show in the reels tab. I am going to say though that just because something shows as a reel or something is a reel, it doesn't mean that people are going to enjoy it as a reel, but they're going to consume that content in the way that they create other reels. So, again, you're focusing on content that your audience will enjoy, not just creating a reel because it's for the sake of creating a reel.

Cat Griffin [00:12:41]:
One thing to do though, and this has become increasingly important, is use a cover for your reel. This is something that's been sort of transitioned across and different players currently show differently, but it's becoming more and more that reels don't automatically play from home screens or in the search screens. So you need a cover for that reel so that people can quickly see, what the reel is. If it's just like a, you know, the first sort of screen grab of a reel, it's not going to tell them anything about the reel. So you need to use a cover much like you would have, like, a static post on Instagram and add that to your reel. And you can do that when you're sharing the reel on Instagram. You can simply select cover and upload your own image, or select a screen grab, so maybe a later screen from within the reel. You can use that to be your cover.

Cat Griffin [00:13:43]:
You can even create reel covers within stories. So use, like, the text and images, options, stickers in stories to create a reel cover too. But it is important that you have a cover for your reel that people can quickly easily see what that reel is going to be about from. Captions are still really important. You still need to have a hook and a call to action. If you are creating reels, you need these in the content of your reel and within text. And your call to action shouldn't just be read the caption. It should be something active within what you're saying within the reel too.

Cat Griffin [00:14:30]:
For example, if you want people to go and check out a link, tell them to check out the link. If you want people to go and read your latest blog post on something, tell people to go and read your latest blog post. Hashtags were huge on Instagram. They are becoming less so, but they aren't redundant. You will still get a few views from hashtags. They're not the way that you go right viral anymore, but they are useful in terms of helping Instagram categorize what your content is about. So make sure hashtags that you are using are very specific to that post that you've created, and you only need to use a handful of hashtags. The days of using 30 hashtags are long behind us.

Cat Griffin [00:15:25]:
But what you do need to use is keywords. So Instagram more and more uses technology to determine what your content is about based on the image and based on your captions. So throughout your caption, you need to be dropping keywords. For example, if you are a a cake baker and you make, custom birthday cakes, those words need to be in your caption, and anything else that might be what people are searching for. For example, if you bake for a local area, then that will be included in your caption. Doesn't have to be every single one, but you do need to have that regularly popping up so that Instagram understands what your content is about and who to show your content to. We also want to be using alt text, alternative text on our images.

Cat Griffin [00:16:28]:
Partly for the reasons that I've just said, but Instagram

Cat Griffin [00:16:33]:
knows what the image of is of because it can see what the image is of, but it doesn't necessarily know the intent behind the image, which you can also add into the alt text. You can also tell it who the image is of. So if the image is of you, put your name in there. This is a photo of Cat Griffin, a woman who is blah blah blah, describing the image there. She's very happy. She looks happy because give the context of a situation that maybe the AI reader won't pick up on. Okay. They don't know every industry.

Cat Griffin [00:17:11]:
They don't know every business. They don't know that that perfect, fondue that you've just created in your hand is why you are extremely excited. But if you're putting your own alt text in there, then you can have that in there. Not only does this help you in terms of having Instagram understand more about your content, it's also just a really good practice to make your content more accessible. And accessibility is something that's becoming increase I mean, look. It's not becoming increasingly important. It's always been important, but it's something increasingly that people are becoming conscious of, people are trying to implement, trying to use within what they do. And also the platforms are taking this on board, and content that is accessible is start it's very early days, but it is starting to get more visibility, and that's a trend which is going to go forwards as we go forwards.

Cat Griffin [00:18:17]:
A few things that the algorithm currently loves. So it still wants you to be active on the platform. Now I'm not saying that you need to spend all day every day active on Instagram, but when you are on Instagram, maybe be mindful of the content that you're looking at. Think about the kind of content that reflects, like your business, your blog, what you do. Try and engage with content relevant to that. It helps ins helps Instagram understand more about you as a person and people that you like to engage with, and then that they might like to engage back with you too. They might like to see your content too. Also, take the time to click and engage with stickers or comments or polls or even just liking content that you genuinely like.

Cat Griffin [00:19:13]:
It just takes a second or 2, but it does just show more that you're active on the platform. It loves it as well when you mix up content. So not just post reels because you think you need to post reels, but post reels and a carousel and a static post and some stories. The different content types allows your content to be shared to different audiences, but still all your target audience. Like, different people like different content types. It allows you to reach more people. It allows more people to engage with your content and then ultimately see your content. Original content is really important.

Cat Griffin [00:20:00]:
Instagram now, if you are the second person to post something, then it will either completely suppress or reduce the reach of that content. As I'm recording this, this is still early days in terms of Instagram implementing this, but it is doing it. It doesn't always get it right, which is a bit problematic. So if you have somebody copying your content, that's something that you need to be reporting and trying to sort of get a handle on. But content yourself, make sure it is original content, that you're not reposting memes or anything like that. Also, give people as many opportunities to engage with your content. So engagement stickers have been around on stories for a long time. They're being rolled out now onto reels.

Cat Griffin [00:20:55]:
You may on may or may not have them currently. So I'm recording this obviously quite a while before the summit is live. They're not rolled out universally yet, so you may have access to these currently. They may still be coming for you. But if you do have opportunities to make engaging for people easy, use them. The easier you make it for people to engage, and not just easy, but fun and actually a way that they want to engage, the more likely people are to to engage. If someone engages with your content, they're more likely to see future content of yours. It helps Instagram understand what kind of people like your content.

Cat Griffin [00:21:39]:
So to just, yeah, make it fun and easy to engage. And reels, 30 to second 30 to 60 second reels are great. 15 seconds, and maybe not enough time to properly draw people in to sort of follow what you're talking about. 90 seconds and people are generally bored, and they scroll through to the next video. Reels are a very short attention span situation. Make use of them, but make use of them in a way that people are going to enjoy, quickly consume, quickly deliver information to them. Okay. I want to talk to you now about some of the features that you should be using on Instagram or can use very effectively on Instagram.

Cat Griffin [00:22:27]:
So number 1, automatic replies. So think of this as a bit like your out of office email, and these can be great for delivering key information to people who sent you a message. So it could be as simple as just telling them, like, what timescale you'll be able to get back

Cat Griffin [00:22:43]:
to them in, but it

Cat Griffin [00:22:44]:
could also be, like, if you're looking to find out more, check this out. If you're looking to purchase this, check this out. So it can be a great way of giving the links directly to people without you actually being there. And you can also take this a step further and set up frequently asked questions. So these can be things like delivering, freebies, directing people to where they can purchase from you, directing people to other ways they can find out more about you. So, for example, if you are a you, for example, you teach crochet and you care for one of your frequently asked questions of where can I find great patterns for crochet? Maybe this is something you offer. So your response to that then, and again it's all automated, you can set this up in Instagram. It's quite easy to do, and the response might be check out my blog post all about great places to find crochet patterns.

Cat Griffin [00:23:45]:
All of the questions might be, how can I learn some basic crochet techniques? And you might have a freebie, a lead magnet. So the answer to that would be, here is a link to my resource all about how you can do basic crochet techniques. I hope you see I don't crochet. I don't know why I just picked this one. Hopefully, it's those examples make sense, but you get the idea. So frequently asked questions you can use to deliver a link, share a link, or directly share some information. They're really good to use because I like automatic replies. If somebody sent you a DM, they're ready to take action.

Cat Griffin [00:24:27]:
They're taking action. They're reaching out to you. Now if you're not there to reply to them, and you're not going to be there to reply to them for 2 or 3 days, the chances are that they will either have lost that momentum to take action, or they will have taken action with somebody else and found something else in that time. So having these set up means that you're giving people a way to take action right there and right then. There are also things like ManyChat and other, chatbots that you can ins install and use. These are things that you can get people to DM your keywords. So, for example, if you talk about something in a reel and you can say DM me, I don't know, bonus, or comment bonus, and these will also send people the link directly. They are really great to use.

Cat Griffin [00:25:21]:
There is a little bit more of a learning curve in setting these up, but it is something that you might want to look at. If you have a shop storefront, any kind of where people can purchase from you, if you can, connect it to Instagram. Not all platforms can be connected, but many can be. This, again, it makes if if you've made a post or a reel and that's done the hard work and it's got people wanting to take action and it's got people wanting to buy from you, if they can click directly with Instagram and get straight to that shop page to buy, then that's when they're ready to take action. As if you can't connect to a shop, absolutely do that. You can also do things like set up appointment booking on Instagram. That's something again, it's a bit more fiddly, a bit more technical to do, but definitely worth looking at if you have an appointment space business, for example. A minimum age is also something that you can use to filter if you're targeting an older audience, and you can set up a minimum age.

Cat Griffin [00:26:34]:
If you're finding that for some reason your posts are reaching a a specific country and you don't actually sell to that country, you don't ship to that country, then you can put in a high minimum you can't exclude posts from being viewed in certain countries, but you can put a high minimum wage minimum age, sorry, for viewing within that country. And then that means that, like, less people are going to see your post in that country. Like, that just it sometimes does happen that for some reason, the algorithm decides that lots of people in America wants to see your posts, but you're based in the UK and you don't ship to America. That could be a problem. This can help sort of get more people in the UK seeing your posts. Now when I am recording this, some of these features aren't quite out yet. So I'm doing a little bit of guesswork in this. But, hopefully, this is going to be true and accurate by the time you are listening to this.

Cat Griffin [00:27:42]:
Now first of all, it's not new, but notes are coming back. So notes are viewable by people when they are looking in the inbox. They also send out notifications to people when you share one. So use notes. People are just starting to use them now in lieu of x or what was found with Twitter. Story and reel comments, where you can actually, like, write comments, add notes, add things to reels, add things to stories. These have started to be rolled out to some countries. They're not everywhere, but they can be publicly visible, so they're viewable to more people seeing leads.

Cat Griffin [00:28:30]:
They send notes to your audience. They can be ways of showing your expertise. They can be ways of connecting with people. These are definitely features to explore and play with. And stickers and text layers are coming out for reels. They're, again, ways of making your reels more engaging, making your reels stand out, giving new ways for people to engage with your content. So Another quick reason why to use new features. Instagram loves it when you play around with their new features.

Cat Griffin [00:29:10]:
If they've put out a new feature, they want lots of people to see it, so it is natural that they will promote, push content that are using new features.

Cat Griffin [00:29:20]:
So give them a play, have an experiment, see how you like them. If you like them, use them. Alright. Hopefully, you enjoyed my presentation today.

Cat Griffin [00:29:31]:
If you do want to connect, then you can pop me an email or send me a message over on Instagram at Cat Gets Social.

Cat Griffin [00:29:42]:
And, yeah, thank you for

Cat Griffin [00:29:44]:
listening, and I hope you enjoyed the rest of this amazing summit.
