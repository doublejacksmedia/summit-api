All right, guys. I'm really excited to have this speaker back. I've been talking to her a lot lately. I'm so excited when I saw her on my calendar today. She's the founder and CEO of the Simple Business School, Membership, and Simple Business Suite. Customized all-in-one software for online business owners. She's a business coach and consultant who helps online business owners run simple, streamlined and in profitable businesses in less than 20 hours a week. She's been in business for nine years and has helped thousands of people start and scale their own business to reach their unique freedom goals. A big warm welcome back to Steph. Steph, thank you so much for coming back.

[00:00:43.200] - Steph Blake
Liz, of course. I'm so glad to be here. I always love talking with you. Thanks for having me.

[00:00:47.380] - Liz Stapleton, Host
It's always a really good time. We're going to be talking about Simplicity and streamlining your business. Why don't we start by, how do you define a simple and streamlined business?

[00:00:58.610] - Steph Blake
When I think of It's a simple and streamlined business. It is a business that essentially works for you, not you working for it. A lot of times people, especially when they're either getting started in business or they've been in business for a while, they just start to do so many things. Things get very overwhelming, very, very quickly. Once they start to even think about scaling, it's not possible for a lot of people because they just have too much happening, too much going on.

[00:01:30.290] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Yeah, I'm guilty. Okay, so when you say it's working for you, are we talking automations? Are we talking about it's instead of seven different things going on, you're really pairing down to one or two? What's the dirty detail there?

[00:01:47.980] - Steph Blake
Yeah, so when I talk simplicity, specifically, especially for people who are in the more beginning stages, I always say, Focus on one thing. Focus on selling one thing and reach your your time freedom goals and your money freedom goals. For most people I work with, they want to reach six figures and they want to work less than 20 hours a week. Have one business, or I'm sorry, sell one thing until you reach that goal. Now, once you reach that goal, whatever that goal is for you. Maybe some people just want... Some people want to make $50,000 and they want to work 40 hours a week, whatever it is. Everybody's situation is unique. So once you reach that goal, then if you have this desire to do more, to pursue another passion, then you can add other things onto it. But we want to make sure that you have everything set up and streamlined so you're not getting overwhelmed when you add these other pieces on. So yes, automation is a really big part of it because if you don't have to do something, let the robots do it for you. But it also comes down to organization, too, on the back end of your business.

[00:02:53.840] - Steph Blake
Because you're going to notice after you set one side of your business up, let's say you do, I don't know, consulting, and you work with people in either a group setting or a one-on-one setting, then you can take a lot of those systems and those processes and you can duplicate them for another offer that you create, or maybe you want to start another business or whatever it is. Really focusing, again, on simplifying by selling one thing and streamlining by setting up all of those back-end processes. That is going to, again, not only allow you to reach your goals initially, but then allow you to scale because you all the pieces in place for this current offer and the next one, and the next one, and the next one, and the next one.

[00:03:35.650] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Let's talk about those pieces because I feel like you think, Oh, I just need... When you first think of it, it seems so simple, but then you actually get into it, it's like 17 tiny steps into that one thing. What are some processes that you see people underestimating in terms of set up and automating or stuff that's under automated? What are some of areas that people should really focus on, honing in on?

[00:04:04.570] - Steph Blake
The biggest thing that I see, especially for people in service-based businesses, is their onboarding. Their onboarding and their offboarding. Far too much of that is done manually, and a lot of people are afraid to automate pieces of that because they're afraid that an email will get accidentally sent or something will go out to the wrong person, and they want to make sure that their client, especially their new client, has It's a really great experience. That's one big thing. Another big thing is, and I know that the people who are listening to this, they don't necessarily have clients because they do a lot of blogging and whatnot. But another big piece that I see people not doing is organizing with digital tools. I know you love ClickUp, I love ClickUp, and a lot of people shy away from that because they think they have to be really tech-savvy. But truthfully, you don't. You can set it up to be as simple or as complex as you want it to be. The biggest thing here is to just use a tool that works for you because, again, that will allow you to simplify things, automate tasks. I love automating tasks, recurring tasks.

[00:05:17.880] - Steph Blake
There's so many different pieces of it. Does that answer your question?

[00:05:20.950] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Yeah, no. I think, especially where you're talking about the example of they're nervous to automate because they don't want an email going out. Well, at least automate to the extent that it's a click of a button to send it when you I want it to. Don't be having to manually write that email every single time or draft that proposal or whatever.

[00:05:38.240] - Steph Blake
Templates, canned emails.

[00:05:41.540] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Yeah. There's so many tools, guys. You could do templates and so many things. I love you could do templates. I do email templates inClickUp.

[00:05:53.290] - Steph Blake
There's so many different- I love Airtable. Yeah.

[00:05:58.970] - Liz Stapleton, Host
So yeah, There's... Never underestimate how much time a template or just a text expanding tool will save you.

[00:06:09.050] - Steph Blake
Yeah. And I think another piece of that is people think that they don't have to document their processes, too, because they're like, Oh, I'll remember. I've done this so many times. But guess what? If you have kids and you're in the middle of doing something and your kid starts throwing up, but you haven't documented your process, then you come back and you're like, Oh, shoot. Did I do that? Did I do that piece? So it's all of this extra brain work.

[00:06:33.050] - Liz Stapleton, Host
It's also going to get to the point in your business, if you're growing, that you probably won't be doing that particular task as often, either because you automate it or you bring on help. I only run this summit once a year. Okay, well, I'm not actually doing the whole transcript processing for a summit session in April. It's once a year. What did I do last year that worked really well? I write it down because otherwise, I know But then it's having to work that much harder to figure it out.

[00:07:04.760] - Steph Blake
And that is one of those things that uses up all of your time, right?

[00:07:08.670] - Liz Stapleton, Host
And if you get into batching, which hopefully everyone does because it's a huge time saver, again, you're not doing that task every day. You're doing it once a month, once every other month. You don't want to have to use that brainpower just document.

[00:07:22.030] - Steph Blake
Yeah, absolutely. And if you're somebody like me with ADHD and you get 30 new ideas a day, guess what? You're not going to be able to remember all of those things because we are still human at the end of the day. I need lists for everything, honestly.

[00:07:39.710] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Okay, let's talk about that a little bit more because, of course, when you scale, it typically brings more tasks, more responsibilities. Lists is just one method, I think, that helps people keep things simple and avoid overwhelm. What are some other ways you've noticed with your clients, especially that they manage that?

[00:07:56.700] - Steph Blake
Like I said before, having a place where you keep all of your tasks. A project management tool is non-negotiable. Non-negotiable, even if you are a solopreneur right now. I started using ClickUp when I was still in my corporate job and a solopreneur, just because, well, one, I just love to organize things. But two, I knew that eventually I needed a platform that was going to grow with me because now I have team members. And guess what? Those team members need access to these things. And it doesn't make sense for me to shoot somebody a text message to ask them to create a graphic in Canva. It's little things like that. Treating your business like an actual business is what it boils down to. When you think of any business out there, I don't know, let's look at... I don't know, Target. Target, for example. Do you think Target has processes for new team members joining? Do you think they have a process for, I don't know, stocking their shelves? Do you think they have a process for even your lunch break? There are documented process for how all of these things work. So it doesn't matter if you're just getting started or your Target or Amazon or a huge giant.

[00:09:06.010] - Steph Blake
You need these different pieces in place to eventually be a truly successful company.

[00:09:11.880] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Yeah. And I will say one thing about ClickUp is that you also have a personal list of like, Oh, yeah, I need to go in the litter box today. It's trash takeout day. So I'm not trying to look at ClickUp in my personal calendar. In my business, it's all just in one place.

[00:09:27.740] - Steph Blake
My gosh, my personal list in ClickUp is a big repository of random ideas that come to my head, too.

[00:09:35.630] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Mine is just the recurring little chores that I need to not let get bad.

[00:09:40.890] - Steph Blake
Yeah. I have a whole other space for my personal life. So again, that's why it's great. You can organize your personal life, you can organize your business life, and you can keep it all in place. So you don't have to go to a bunch of different tools. That's another thing, is simplifying the tools. So many people are

[00:10:00.450] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Especially, from a recovering to appsumo addict?

[00:10:02.860] - Steph Blake
Same.

[00:10:05.260] - Liz Stapleton, Host
When people are getting to the point where maybe they're scaling because they've got these foundational pieces in place, what are some of the first tasks or roles that you suggest they consider outsourcing or delegating?

[00:10:19.120] - Steph Blake
Yeah. Well, I mean, at this point, you should be outsourcing anything financial because you should not be doing that. If you're at the point of scaling, you should outsource your bookkeeping, you should outsource your accounting. All of that should already be outsourced at this point. That is not something that you need to worry about. Then if you haven't brought on somebody to do admin work in your business, things like answering support emails, making sure people get access to things. For example, if you're creating courses and people can't get access to it, you need somebody to come in and do those little pieces or somebody to come in and create graphics. It's hard to say, honestly, because it's so unique to each business and what each business needs. For example, I have a membership and I have a software company. I have team members devoted to both things because the tasks are very different and they require very unique sets of skills. I also run bundles, and I have one person that manages all of our bundles. I can't just say, Okay, I need one person to do all of these different things. It's so unique to each individual business.

[00:11:29.350] - Steph Blake
I would say Okay, look at your big goal. I would say for the year, honestly, think about what it's going to take to reach that goal and then hire people to fill those roles before you get there. Because if that is going to allow you, having people in those roles will allow you to reach that so much more quickly than if you try to just do it on your own because you're just going to be at the same place year after year after year, wondering why you're not hitting that goal when you are one person and you can only do so much.

[00:11:59.220] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Absolutely. Okay, so when you are deciding to automate, and there's obviously so many different tools out there that help you automate, how do you decide what to automate and what you should keep hands on? Is there something that you're like, This is always going to be hands-on for me?

[00:12:15.130] - Steph Blake
Yeah. So the things that I like to keep hands on are things where I know it requires a personal touch for me. So for example, the bundles are a good example. So I host bundles once a quarter, at least at the time of recording this. We may be doing more. But when Whenever those emails go out to our contributors, I like to write those because I'll do a daily recap of everything. So that is not something that can be automated because I need to take time to review the things that happened the day before, put all the stats in, add my personal touch. I would say anything that requires a personalized touch from you should not be automated. Now, things like your welcome sequence, obviously, that should be automated. You do not need to be sending that out. Things like booking calls with you, that should be automated. When it comes to... I don't know, I'm trying to come up with some examples off the top of my head right now. Really, anything that requires a personal touch from you should not be automated. Anything else can be automated. You'll see very quickly that 95% of things in your business do not require a personal touch from you.

[00:13:23.640] - Steph Blake
They don't.

[00:13:25.920] - Liz Stapleton, Host
No, I like that. Yeah, once you've created it, that was your personal touch. You don't need to continue.

[00:13:35.560] - Steph Blake
Create it one time, leave it.

[00:13:39.180] - Liz Stapleton, Host
When it comes to measuring the success of everything, what metrics do you think are essential for tracking growth and efficiency without overcomplicating the process?

[00:13:52.310] - Steph Blake
I'm going to be honest with you. Numbers are not my favorite thing. They are very hard for my brain to understand. They always have been. I I don't know why. But I have come to learn over the years that it is so crucial, especially as you're scaling, because you have to see what's working, you have to see what's not working. I like to track, obviously, on a monthly basis, on a quarterly basis, and on an annual basis. I always like to go back and refer to the data from that previous time period. For example, when we host a bundle, I'll keep track of all of the stats, and then I'll go back and reference the previous bundle to see, Okay, how did this perform compared to that? That could be anything like sales for the day, overall sales, clicks for the page, abandoned checkouts, What else? Clicks on emails. So again, that's something that's very specific to the... If you're launching something, it's going to be very specific to that. On an ongoing basis, though, bare minimum, everybody needs to be tracking your revenue, your total revenue, the total amount of cash, the amount of cash that you're keeping, the amount of cash that you're spending, your expenses on your team, your tools, all of that.

[00:15:13.850] - Steph Blake
And then I also, again, along the same lines of simplicity, tell people to focus on one free resource. One free resource aligned with that one free offer until you reach your goals. So you should constantly be tracking the data for that free resource. So How many clicks is it getting? What's your conversion rate? How many sales is that getting you? And just putting that out in tons of different areas. The other piece of that is the collaboration that you do. For example, for this event, I'm going to be tracking whether or not it brought me leads, whether or not it brought me clients. Spoiler alert, all of Liz's do. That's what I love participating in them. I know that was a big list, so I don't know. Was that helpful? Do you need me to clarify anything?

[00:16:02.670] - Liz Stapleton, Host
No, I think that's great. I love numbers, actually, so I'm a little different than you. But I struggle to set... I don't want to have to go dig up the data every single time, but I struggle to set up and create a dashboard in data studio or something. I just, finally, hopefully set it up properly, a data overview of how Black Friday stuff is going for me. We'll see. But it is. We all have our little blocks and struggles What else with that?

[00:16:31.230] - Steph Blake
For all of our sales, I do have an Airtable database set up that does all of that for me on autopilot. So I just look and I say, Okay, how much should we make this month? All of that, like what were the best sellers? All of that, because I don't want to think about that.

[00:16:44.600] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Yeah. Okay, final question. Looking back on your own journey, what are some things you would have done differently to scale more smoothly?

[00:16:52.600] - Steph Blake
My goodness. How long do you have?. Thank Okay, so really the biggest thing, and this is probably going to sound hilarious coming from me, but simplifying sooner. Because my first year in business, I had eight different businesses because I had undiagnosed ADHD, and I was just so excited about this new beautiful online world I found. So that is really one of the most important things I would do. And then also remember, and this is going to sound so cheesy, so cheesy, but it's true, to remember that It's you are on your own journey. You are not comparing yourself to anybody else because I got stuck in that trap for years, years, and years, and years of looking at people who I thought were on the same path as me. We started business together. This person was here. I was here. I was like, What's going on? Why are they surpassing me? I'm so much smarter. Blah, blah, blah, blah, all of these things, right? Not taking into account all of the other things in my life, not taking account their background, their experience, right? There's all these different things that we don't think about.

[00:18:03.810] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Absolutely.

[00:18:05.040] - Steph Blake
you be you.

[00:18:06.230] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Yeah. The other website is that. It's chase after your own version of success. Exactly. That's something that I got stuck doing more than once because if you don't learn your lesson the first time, life will make sure you get to learn the lesson again. You're like, Oh, I want that. And you go get it because you take that course and you get there and you're like, That's actually not what I want. So make sure you're taking a step back and evaluating what the business is like you want and then be on your own.

[00:18:33.260] - Steph Blake
Yeah, and literally build your business around the life that you want. That's the most important thing.

[00:18:39.200] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Yeah, I like that. Okay, is there anything else you last minute, if you want to share with them before we talk about all the things they can get from you.

[00:18:48.050] - Steph Blake
I mean, I have so many different things to share, but like I said, my biggest piece of advice is just keep things really, really simple. And that just means reducing the number of things that you're selling until you reach your goals. That's really my biggest piece of advice, because the more simple that you can be, the more quickly that you will be able to scale.

[00:19:09.310] - Liz Stapleton, Host
All right. So why don't you go ahead and tell everyone what they can grab the link below? I'm pretty I think it's a pretty awesome offer.
