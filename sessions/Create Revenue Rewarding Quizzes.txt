Hey, hey, hey. Welcome to this exclusive quiz lead generation training with me Jack Long. And I'm really excited to be diving into the power of quizzes to help you grow your email list, segment your leads, and present your offers and your promotions based on where your prospects are currently at -- your prospect's current situation. So, if you're ready to start leveraging quizzes for your marketing power, you could see anything up to four to five times return on your investment and your revenues versus, say, offering an average PDF to your audience as a lead magnet. So, we're going to dive straight into this training. I like to just get on with things, and I want to just start this training by just saying quizzes are hot. You're in the right place right now if you want to create a quiz to grow your email list with hot leads. As you can see here with my screenshot that we've been running a campaign for the last 30 days and our quiz has received over 700 views, 702 views. And from those 700 people that viewed our quiz, they all went through the quiz, opted in and became a lead meaning our conversion rate for our quiz is 82 percent conversion rate, which is not to be snipped, especially as the average PDF can be 30 to 40 percent.

[00:01:24.560] - Jack
So it's double your PDF, if not triple your PDF, depending on what your PDF converts at. So, if we have 100 people we are sending to our quiz, 82 percent of our audience are becoming a lead and joining our email list is really exciting. Now, the other thing we love about quizzes is that it's the same effort to create a quiz than it is to create a PDF in, say, using a platform like Canva. It's the same energy to promote your quiz than it is to promote a PDF. It's the same budget to set aside for ads and marketing on advertising platforms than it would be to acquire a lead for a PDF. And it's the same audience. You're just going to send your quiz out to the same audience. But as you can see, the conversion rates there are far greater with the quiz. I'm going to be explaining exactly why quizzes are so powerful and how you can utilize the quiz for your marketing going forward to grow your business. So real quick, my name is Jack Long. I'm your go-to-quiz expert. I specialize in elevating digital entrepreneurs like yourself to grow your business with strategic power of an engaging quiz so that you can boost and grow and send more traffic to your website, send more traffic to your promotions, send more traffic to your launches, attract higher quality leads, but effortlessly generate more revenues as well with a quiz.

[00:02:36.690] - Jack
So I'm going to show you how you do that how you can generate more revenues by using a quiz. So, let's dive into this, right. Let's show you the power of a revenue rewarding quiz. So I've already explained quizzes are hot. They're highly engaging, as I've already shown you that as well. They're high converting, but they're also highly profitable. On the screen right now, these are some quizzes that I've created for my business for different --various angles to try and grow my email list with different people because I have different promotions running. And quizzes are really fun and engaging, and that's the whole purpose of a quiz, to attract the eye, grab your audience's attention, turn them into leads, and then very quickly turn them into a customer as well. And that's exactly what a quiz can do. So what I've got for you today is the number one thing that I want to share with you is you will get a full understanding and a whole method and strategy into how a quiz lead magnet could actually double your sales, okay, by just following my five very simple hacks, and I'm going to be giving those to you right now.

[00:03:32.590] - Jack
And this works if you are either you've already got a quiz, but maybe it needs some tweaking, or you're a first time quiz creator and you're really excited about diving into creating a quiz. And this is for -- this training is specifically for course creators, online coaches, membership program owners, digital products or service providers. Anybody who has a digital program or a course or anything like that online that you are selling your products and your programs online this is perfect for you. All right, so let's get straight into hack number one. How are quizzes more engaging than any other kind of content that you might be creating for your audience? How are quizzes engaging? So, let's take, for example, the online social media platforms and channels where you may be creating content on a weekly, daily, monthly basis to try and engage your, your audience. Now, obviously, we've got Instagram. We've got Facebook. We've got podcasts. We've got YouTube. It doesn't matter what platform you use. But I'm just going to quickly highlight Instagram for this very specific training because everyone knows what Instagram is. So how many posts -- this is the question I'm asking you, right?  How many posts or how many stories or how many reels does someone who follows you, your audience, how many of those reels, stories, and posts do they need to engage with you on your Instagram channel before they become a customer. Right?

[00:04:48.920] - Jack
How many pieces of content does someone need to engage that you're posting on a weekly basis, on a monthly basis, on a yearly basis before they become a customer? Maybe the question should be, how many weeks does it take or how many months or how many years does it take for one of your Instagram followers to engage with your content to then become a customer? I'm going to average to say it's more than a month. Right? If someone follows you today, they're not going to become a customer tomorrow. At the very minimum, they might become a customer with you or work with you in some capacity maybe in a month's time. But it takes a long time these days to nurture your audience across any one of these channels whether it's Instagram, Facebook, you know, YouTube, TikTok, or wherever. Okay. So quizzes are a lot faster to engage with your audience and then ultimately warm them up to the point where they're just ready to buy from you instantly. Okay. And this is the power of a quiz and this is how it works. So, what we do first of all is we want to look at your -- the quiz kind of landing page. On the left-hand side there

[00:05:49.980] - Jack
you can see mine is brightly colored. It says take the quiz. It's like a superhero-style quiz that I've created. And it says, "What kind of marketing superhero are you?" Now, when they click on the button, it's a very, very micro step. Clicking on a button is very micro step to like like liking or hearting a post on Instagram. It's a micro step. Okay. But it's still an engagement. It's still a step where they are engaging with that piece of content. And once they've clicked from that take the quiz button, now we send them for a series of about seven questions. And each of your quiz questions is a piece of content that your audience will automatically engage with and interact with throughout your quiz. So, each of your question has a series of answers and they are engaging and they are like recognizing the answers or they are either, yes, that is me, or they're also saying, no, that is not me, or, yes, I like this, and no, I don't like this. They are telling you vital information about themselves. They're giving you vital data about who they are, where they are, what are their problems, what are their frustrations, what are their ideal solutions. Right?

[00:06:57.670] - Jack
What do they see? What do they envision in the future? What are they struggling with right now? And they do this across seven pieces of content because each of your quiz question, with all the answers, is seven pieces of different actual content, all right. And so, meaning that your audience will engage with your content at least seven times inside a quiz. Okay. And this is the power of a quiz. Now, we recommend you have about seven questions. If you have eight or if you have nine, it's okay. And there are very specifically -- there's an order that each of those questions go in a specific order in order so that your audience do actually finish your quiz because the last thing you want to do is your audience landing on question number one being turned off straight away and closing your quiz down. Okay. We don't want that to happen to you, so we have them in a very specific psychological order that works like a dream. So here's the thing, this -- if you look at quizzes, quizzes are engaging pieces of content. You can have images on quizzes. Okay. You can have -- obviously, you've got multiple-choice answers. You can have it in any color palette that you like, and your branding, and your wording, however you like to see fit.

[00:08:06.530] - Jack
You can have actual images as actual answers. Okay. You can have GIFs to make it more engaging. Whatever you want to do, however you want to create your content for your quiz you can make it really highly engaging. And again, if you think about reels and TikTok and other platforms, they are highly engaging with moving content, with polls, questions and answers. There are lots of those features inside those platforms, so your audience will easily take your quiz and will fully engage with the content inside your quiz. So that is why quizzes are really engaging. Your quiz takers will engage with your quiz at least seven times and they will engage with that content seven times in under three minutes and they will instantly then take action. No social media content can do that in this time frame. Think about it. That's that seven Instagram posts or seven Instagram stories or seven Instagram reels or a combination of those features on Instagram seven to eight times that your audience will be engaging with. Do they then take action and become a lead? Very unlikely so that's why quizzes are hot. Okay. Hack number two, how to quickly create a quiz lead magnet.

[00:09:18.770] - Jack
This is one question I get all the time. But Jack it sounds amazing. But doesn't it take ages to create a quiz. I wouldn't even know where to begin. It's actually really quite simple because I have simplified this to make it easy for you to be able to do. So there are really kind of four elements to what makes up a really high, engaging quiz to ultimately turn a cold lead into a warm hot, sorry, cold prospect, shall I say, into a warm, hot lead. So, the first step is by creating a landing page which is basically just a quiz title, a nice image that attracts your ideal audience, a small subtext, and then a button that simply just says take the quiz. That's the first step. It's a very quick and easy landing page. Then we've got the seven questions -- or each question is different. Each question leads your users, your quiz takers from one question to the next effortlessly. And each question is basically dissecting information from your ideal audience so that you can then understand where your audience are at so that you can sell more digital products or maybe new digital products, discover new things about your audience you didn't know. And then we've got an opt-in form.

[00:10:16.870] - Jack
We want to make sure that we grab their lead -- grab, sorry, their personal details and turn them into a lead. Right? We want to make sure they grab their details. And then we grab their details like their email address which is the most important detail we want there, and their information. We grab that before we give them their result. But remember, they're not taking small micro steps by watching a story or clicking a like or a heart on a post. They're actually engaging with seven questions. They're reading the question. They're choosing an answer -- moving on to the next question. They're engaging with the content. They've just taken seven large steps, okay, during your quiz questions. So, when it comes to the opt-in form, actually giving you their email address then now feels like a very small micro step again, and that's the power of a quiz. Okay. And then -- and then, of course, they're going to be dying at the same time -- they're going to be dying to see their quiz result. What is my result? Okay. Because we humans are very inquisitive people. We are dying to see a result about ourselves. We're dying to see what our next steps are in order to eradicate this problem that we've got.

[00:11:15.440] - Jack
What is our ideal personalized, tailored solution? We'll, we'll be dying to see this information and that will be the same for your audience as well. They're only five quiz-building steps that you need to follow. Step number one is your quiz title. Okay. We give you a formula so that you can very quickly follow our formula and, and craft your own high attention-grabbing title so that you always attract the right prospects to become a lead. Step number two is your audience, okay, your audience. Your quiz needs to be perfectly aligned to your audience. Okay. And we help you do that. Step number three is your quiz questions. Like I said before, there are seven questions -- seven psychological questions that go in a very specific order. I'm going to share with you how you can -- what those questions, sorry, look like later on. And then step number four is your quiz results. Of course, you want to wow your audience. You want to give them results so they take the next steps -- next action with you. And then step number five is once you've done steps one to four, you then plug that information into the actual quiz building software that we use, and the quiz building software is really easy.

[00:12:16.100] - Jack
It's as easy as just like writing an email in any other email CRM software you probably use as well. So, five really quick steps to get your quiz up and running and out there in no time as you can see here with some of our quiz students that we have who have taken my formula and gone through those five steps and created their own quiz. You can see they're eye-catching. And all of our students are in so many different niche markets offering so many different products and promotions and services on -- in the online space. So, you know, my own students have an amazing time in their quiz. They're growing their business and scaling their business with a quiz as the front funnel to grow their email list. Now, that's not all. As you know, quizzes are engaging. They're eye-catching, high converting, fun to create, easy to build. I've proven all of those things. But they're also highly profitable and here is how they're that. So the power of quizzes, this is my revenue rewarding quiz method that I teach my students. It's very quick to understand once you understand the methods of it, and it's incredibly powerful yet unbelievably simple. And when I teach it, my students always go, oh, my God, that is so incredibly genius and yet so simple.

[00:13:22.490] - Jack
Let me quickly show you how it is. This is how to sell more of your offers to your audience by having a quiz, no PDF, no cheat sheet. Not even a webinar can actually do this. Okay. So this is the problem we normally have or normally see with most marketers online trying to attract their ideal audience. You see, you probably -- most marketers see their audience as one whole collective. Okay. They see their audience, their community, as a whole collective. They, they think or they assume that their audience all have the same problem. So, if you think about the health and fitness is like, well, all of my audience have the same problem. They all want to lose weight. Okay. And you're going to, even if you're niche down, it's like, well, I know exactly who my audience are. They are, I know -- they are women who are over 40 and they all want to lose weight. So therefore, they assume instantly that their audience is the same person. They're all women over 40 that want to lose weight and they all want the same thing. But actually, that's the wrong way about thinking about it. And this is why a lot of people, a lot of businesses, should I say, struggle to scale their actual business.

[00:14:25.520] - Jack
So, let's look at the fitness and health as an example. And what we should be looking at our audience is an amazing array of colors, colorful, beautiful people, right. And as you can see here, I have kind of differentiated and separated this audience out now into four different colors. This is probably pretty much where the health and fitness example comes into play nicely for everyone to understand this. Okay. So you got gym member, too busy to exercise, tried every diet under the sun, and then yo- yo dieting. Okay. Now, this is really important because a quiz is going to ask your audience a series of questions. Okay. It's basically going to ask this audience here, the kind of bland looking blue and gray audience is how we all see our audience -- is going to ask this audience a series of questions over a course of seven psychological quiz questions. And then it's going to dissect these people and filter them and segment them into a very specific situation where these people -- this audience are at. So that now our marketer, okay, this could be you, me, whoever has the quiz, the quiz owner can now talk to this audience specifically based on their own situation and struggles and problems as to why they're unable, in this case, why they're unable to lose weight. Okay.

[00:15:36.090] - Jack
So, for example, if they discover someone's a gym membership, they can now very specifically talk to that person directly to their situation. Look, look I know, you know, you've got an expensive gym membership that you're going down the gym every single week and you're trying and you're grafting, you're putting the hard work and you've got an expensive membership that you're paying for but you're not seeing the results that you want. But if you join our program, not only do you cut your membership subscription in half, but you also, you know, can now start doing exercises from home. Start getting fit and healthy, and you actually get to start seeing the results that you really want. Check out Stacey. She used to have a gym membership. Check out Brad. He used to have a gym membership. Check out whoever. They used to have a gym membership and look at the results they're now getting since they joined our program. Let you see the power of what a quiz can now do. You can now be more specific and talk to your audience based of where they're at. And then again, you know, you're going to have a similar person. Again, there's another lady potentially who could be over 40 that wants to lose weight but is too busy.

[00:16:34.900] - Jack
Maybe this is a profession -- a professional person, right, in the corporate world. So now you can say, hey, look, I know you're too busy to exercise. I know that you're a professional person with a professional job, blah, blah, blah, blah. However, my program nicely fits around people who are too busy to exercise. We actually have exercise, you know, exercise regimes and training programs, fitness programs, sorry, that are only X minutes long and you can do them in between any time you're busy. And also, we've got an amazing meal plan that doesn't take hardly any time to create the most amazing, healthy meals so that you don't have to keep getting takeout food because you're too busy to cook. Okay. Our program is perfect fit for the too busy professional who's too busy to exercise. Okay. And then you can say again the same to the other people who tried every diet. I know you've tried every diet under the sun, but this is not a diet program or, you know, the yo- yo diets. I know that you lose weight, but you also put it on just as fast. That's because you've been doing it this way, this way, this way, and this way and, you know, that's not your fault.

[00:17:36.520] - Jack
You've just been sold some fad yo-yo diet. But actually, our program makes sure that you lose the weight and you keep it off for long term and you'll never get regain the weight again. So again, you can start talking to your audience based off of their situations, and this is the power of a quiz. So, let's think about marathon runners as another example -- as another quiz niche market. Okay. You're also instantly going to be like, hey, marathon runners ever wants to, you know, maybe take a course or a program to learn how to, oh sorry, not learn, but how to actually run a marathon. But the thing is you shouldn't be looking at your audience as everybody who wants to run a marathon. You see, you can have two, potentially more than two, but two different types of people who are going to be taking this quiz. You've got people that want to run a marathon. It could be their 100th marathon, but they want to somehow discover how they can run their personal best. And then you got others that want to discover, actually, what are the first steps I need to take to actually start to train to run a marathon?

[00:18:29.580] - Jack
Two very different people, but they all want the same outcome -- is the outcome is simply run a marathon. Right? I want to run a marathon. It's simple, but they're both two very different people who want to run a marathon for two very different reasons. And again, a quiz is going to allow you to talk to those people very specifically and sell products and courses and whatever services based off of their situation. And again, here's another example as an Instagram -- let's say we've got an Instagram expert who teaches there, I don't know, teaches course creators how to utilize the power of Instagram to sell more of their digital courses and products. So maybe their quiz is called, which Instagram feature should I focus on? Because you think about Instagram, there's so many features. There's Reels. There's Posts. There's Stories. There's this. There's that, and maybe our course creator doesn't know which one they should go all in on to feature on so they take the quiz. They answer all the questions. They enter in their email address and their name. They click on Submit, and they get to then see their result. But here's the interesting thing and the most amazing thing about quizzes is, let's say our Instagram expert has more than one course or product or toolkit or, you know, mini offer or membership to offer their audience, they've got an array of product suites to offer at any given time, well, then this is where the quiz comes into its true power.

[00:19:46.040] - Jack
You can now perfectly align your offers based off your audience's quiz results and that, ladies and gentlemen, is the power of a quiz. So there you go. That's the power of quizzes. You're leaving money on the table by not offering your products or your services when your audience needs it the most which is right now straight after they've taken the quiz, not in a month's time when you think you need to warm them up with emails and sending them out a ton of podcast episodes. Grab your audience at the hottest moment and a quiz can do that for you. And then hack number four: how to have your quiz wow your audience. So look who else has a quiz. Okay. This is one of the other reasons why we should all be focusing on having a quiz because a lot of the top online marketers like Amy Porterfield, like Lewis Howes, like James Wedmore, like Jenna Kutcher, like Brendan Pritchard, and many, many others all have a quiz in their business for them to grow their business. They have quizzes to grow their email list. They, they run a quiz during their launch events, during other promotions and other times of the year.

[00:20:46.870] - Jack
They are all offering quizzes to their audience, and here's Amy Porterfield's quiz as an example. As you can see, it's a really nice, eye-catching quiz. It looks incredibly professional and it's very enticing to take it. She's looking at the camera. It's in a nice pale kind of yellow. She's got a really enticing title. Its call to action simple, take the free quiz. And you want to discover what it is that she's offering here. Okay. This is the power of a quiz. There are no hurdles, okay, for your audience to jump over. It's simple. It's easy. Take the quiz, done. And that's why people like Amy Porterfield have quizzes. Here's one of my students. This is Lisa Woodford, and as you can see, right, Lisa's quiz is so eye-catching. Why is My Teenager Actually Driving Me Crazy and What Can I Do About It? So any parent who has a teenager in their house slamming doors, being grumpy, you know, not being very nice, hostile environment as a teenager can cause this quiz is going to grab that parent and say, yeah, I want to know why my teenager is driving me crazy, and I also want to know how I can deal with this.

[00:21:51.400] - Jack
So Lisa created a quiz and it's absolutely, you know, exploding her business for her. And as you can see, Lisa was originally giving away a free PDF. And a PDF is a great PDF, but her quiz is converting so much higher. But what Lisa did, and this is what we also teach, is take content you've already got. Take content from your free PDF. Take that amazing content inside there and put it into your quiz. Use some of your content in your PDF across your quiz questions and your quiz answers. Use some of the content in your PDF across your quiz results pages so that your audience are always reading the same content over and over again across different, different ways in way you're delivering it, whether it's a PDF or whether it's a quiz. It doesn't matter. But as you can see though, the conversions there are far greater with Lisa's quiz versus her PDF. Hack number five, final hack, quizzes can be simple when you follow the right method. And that is the one thing I need to say here is because a lot of people assume quizzes are difficult, and they're really not. Okay. A lot of our students aren't that tech savvy and that's okay, but they can create a quiz very quickly.

[00:22:52.180] - Jack
So, the first step that you need to do with your quiz creation journey is to create your quiz title. So, you need to determine who your quiz is for. What is your audience? Okay. What are your audience interested in? And what problems do you need to help solve for your audience? That is the first thing. You captivate a really high-engaging quiz title. Now, like I said, we've got a formula and a framework that our students follow and they create their quiz title literally in under 10 minutes. Really easy, but it's a high converting title. Step number two is your quiz audience. So, you want to make sure that your quiz attracts the right leads, but also at the same time repels the people who are not a good fit for your offers and your services. So I'm going to use a really simple example of this. Okay. Let's say you specialize in coaching women. Well, you don't want a bunch of men joining your email list, right? Because although you've got nothing wrong with that, of course, they're just not the right fit for your coaching program that's specifically for women. And so therefore, you want to repel people. And again, we teach people how to do this.

[00:23:51.870] - Jack
And it's such an important thing with marketing. You can't serve everyone. Trying to serve everyone in your audience will actually lead you to serving no one, and we actually have training in this as well and a mindset thing as well. It's really cool. Well, step number three, your quiz questions. There are seven psychological quiz questions, okay, not six, not eight, not nine, seven. And you must follow these seven questions in a very specific order so that your audience effortlessly finishes your quiz, and that your audience are then buzzing at the end of your seventh question ready to give you their email address and their name to see their quiz results. Step number four is your quiz results. Now, you should definitely be offering a digital product or a service or a call to action of any kind at the end of your quiz results page. It could be a product. It could be join your membership program. It could be jump on a call with you for a free 30-minute, free 30-minute call. It could even be, you know, a call to action to join your up and coming training program or a launch event like a five-day challenge or webinar. Whatever it is, meet your audience where they're at right now in the market space so that you can give them the right next step going forward.

[00:25:02.420] - Jack
And that step going forward is with you, not a competitor. Step number five, your quiz launched. So, once you've done the first four steps, building your quiz is really easy. It takes probably no more than half an hour. So, build and launch your quiz to the world via social media, paid advertising, and even have your fans promote your quiz for viral potential. Okay. So now, are you ready to create a quiz? Because if you're not nodding, going, oh, my God, this is amazing. This is going to smash anything out of the park. Nobody in my -- nobody in my niche market is offering anything like this. I need to jump on this right now. Then this is the perfect time for you.
