Hi, and welcome to today's session, Brand Protection with Federal Trademark registration. My name is Nicole Cheri Oden, and I am married to my high school sweetheart. We have an almost seven year old little girl, and I'm a licensed attorney in the state of California. I have my own virtual boutique law firm, Nicole Cheri Oden Law P.C, as well as an online business, which is legal templates and more, providing legal templates and resources for other online service providers and digital product creators. So today, we're going to chat not only about what a trademark is, we're also going to cover the benefits of federal trademark registration for your blog and your online business.

[00:00:54.370] - Nicole
The importance of doing a comprehensive search sooner rather than later, and a bit about what a comprehensive search is, as well as three questions to ask yourself to decide if your business is ready to move forward with federal trademark registration. Before I launch in, know that everything I share is legal education and information. It's not business, financial, or legal advice. It doesn't create an attorney client relationship between us.

[00:01:21.130] - Nicole
You definitely want to chat with an attorney in your local area. And since I'm licensed in California, in the United States, everything I share today is going to be from the perspective of United States law. Okay? So with that in mind, let's first cover the key distinction between a brand and a trademark, because while they are lumped together frequently, they actually are two very different things. So a brand is the personality, character, identity, reputation, really the goodwill that your blog and online business have built that's recognized by the public.

[00:01:59.850] - Nicole
So you actually build your community and you sell because of your brand. A trademark, on the other hand, represents your brand in the marketplace, and it helps consumers identify your blog or online business as the source of products or services. So a trademark is a word, phrase, logo, graphic, or symbol that ties to your brand. For discussion purposes, today, we're going to lump trademarks and service marks under the umbrella of trademark. There is a difference.

[00:02:34.600] - Nicole
So trademarks tied to goods versus service marks tied to services. Under the law, they are used pretty interchangeably, and we're going to do so today. So what does this brand verse trademark distinction have anything to do with your blog and your online business? Well, let's take a step back. I can almost guarantee that in your family, there is a distinct preference for one product or service over another with a different competing company for some specific reason. The ones that just come to mind for me are the Coca Cola versus Pepsi debate.

[00:03:07.900] - Nicole
I'm sure your family falls on one side of the line or the other. There is a very distinct difference in how the products taste, in my humble opinion. They also have very distinct feelings behind their messaging, and they have very distinct trademarks. So with CocaCola, you think of that white script font with Pepsi, you think of the white, red and blue, and they have a very distinct, bold block font. 

[00:03:36.720] - Nicole
Think about shoewear if the Pepsi-Coke debate's not for your family, what about the Nike Swoosh versus the Adidas three lines? You maybe have a preference versus the comfort and the wearability of one or the other. But again, both products also have a very distinct brand behind them. Taking it to the online space, I know bloggers sometimes have a very definitive opinion on the type of website that they want to establish their blog on. Be that WordPress, be that Squarespace, or Wix, or all of these other emerging platforms that you can use.

[00:04:09.860] - Nicole
There are two components to this conversation, the brand, the reason behind why you choose to lean toward one or the other, and their trademarks that differentiate them in the marketplace. You would know picking up a can of soda, what's Coke and what's Pepsi? That's because of their trademark. So what can be a trademark? This is your blog, business, podcast, product and service names, your logo, slogans, tagline, those are all trademarks from the moment that you start using them.

[00:04:42.280] - Nicole
Interestingly enough, other things that can be trademarks, can be sounds, smells, and color schemes if they identify your blog or online business as the source of products or services. So some examples, sounds, we are probably all familiar with that, NBC Chime, that is a registered trademark. Smell, playdoh, weirdly enough, the smell of playdoh is a registered trademark. Color scheme, Tiffany blue, we all know what it is.

[00:05:14.370] - Nicole
Registered trademark, they all tie to a specific product or service. Now, when I said that your blog and online business names, product and service names, all these things are trademarks, that is true. There is a difference, though, between what we call common law trademarks and registered trademarks. So the United States has what's called a first in use system, meaning you have trademark protection simply by using the mark in the marketplace first. So the second that you launch your blog using a blog name, trademark, the second that you launch your ecommerce store selling journals and t shirts, trademark.

[00:05:56.370] - Nicole
But the protections for that common law, unregistered trademarked limited, limited to the geographic area that your business is located and where you're using the mark. So let's say that for discussion purposes, you launch a small store in Arkansas and you just sell to neighboring states. That is the zone of reach of your trademark. Now, it gets a little bit blurry, especially for bloggers and online businesses, because the internet essentially makes it possible for people from potentially other countries to read your blog to purchase things from your ecommerce store. So there's a new, more nuanced analysis when it comes to blogs and online businesses in terms of the reach.

[00:06:50.060] - Nicole
That being said, if you register your trademark with the United States Continent Trademark Office or USPTO, you get protection in all 50 states, among other benefits, which we're going to talk about in a minute. But that's even if you haven't started selling to some of these other states, so let's say you have your business in Arkansas that starts an ecommerce store, and now you're making sales in 25 of the 50 states. Irrespective, you still get protection in all 50 states if you decide to move forward with federal trademark registration. So what are some of the other benefits of registration?

[00:07:26.470] - Nicole
So we talked about those exclusive rights that you get across the United States, but you get the ability to enforce them. And we're going to talk about that in a minute. One of the other cool things is you also get the ability to use that R in a circle. So if you reach registration, you can use that symbol next to your trademark to alert potential infringes of your registration. Sidebar, you do not want to use that symbol unless you have a registered trademark because you could be found guilty of fraud.

[00:07:58.680] - Nicole
Going to stop there. Not going to go more into it because I'm limited in time today. But you want to make sure that you're only using that symbol if you have a registered trademark. Now the little TM for trademark and the little SM for service mark, you can use those to assert your rights, you know next to your blog name, next to podcast name. But don't transition to the r in a circle unless you have actually achieved registration.

[00:08:25.610] - Nicole
So I talked about being able to enforce your exclusive rights across the United States because of registration. And that means you can actually sue if somebody infringes on your mark in federal court. And with that, if you are successful in your infringement lawsuit, you recover attorney's fees and damages. And that means they are statutorily provided. If somebody infringes on your mark, you have to take them to court and you win.

[00:08:51.420] - Nicole
You get damages and attorney's fees because of their bad behavior, essentially. Another cool thing, especially if you have goods, so if you have an ecommerce store that provides journals, t-shirts, candles, all sorts of physical goods, you can actually file your registration with the United States Customs Service to prevent the importation of infringing goods. So they will have that registration, and as things are being imported, they scan them to make sure that there's not an infringement issue.

[00:09:26.080] - Nicole
And if there is, they actually, you know, deny the goods from being brought into the country. It also makes the experience of registering your mark in foreign countries much more expeditious if you already have a registration here in the United States. And this is increasingly important for bloggers and online businesses because we are essentially an international commerce at this point. So I mean, we are all connected because of the interwebs, and so you may start small and build into other countries, UK, Canada, Australia, Asia.

[00:10:01.160] - Nicole
The sky really is the limit, and that is the beauty of online business, so something to consider. And one of I think the greatest things about federal tradmark registration is you gain a very valuable asset for your company. So maybe you started a small business and you weren't kind of trying to plan to take it to a behemoth business, so a large corporate entity, maybe that is in the cards and that's kind of where you're planning on taking it. It is an asset to your company. If you are building a business to sell, one of the pieces of the due diligence process that the purchasing company will come to is actually evaluate to see if you have registrations for your trademarks in place, because that adds value to your brand and to your business.

[00:10:47.210] - Nicole
That is because, and I'm going to explain why in a minute, but copyright and patent protections are time limited. So not getting into what copyright and patent protections are, whole other conversation. And since I'm time limited today, will just suffice it to say that when you register those specific forms of IP, the protections are good for a limited period of time. This is where the value comes in with federal trademark registration. That is not true. With federal trademark registration, it could potentially last indefinitely so long as you continue using the mark and you stay current with your maintenance and renewal filing. 

[00:11:30.110] - Nicole
A lasting legacy for your business or your blog and it's definitely something that you want to consider for the long term. I think a lot of online businesses start small. Sometimes there's a side hustle and things can escalate and grow and expand, and that is an amazing thing. Planning to make sure that you have that asset in your back pocket can be very beneficial for you.

[00:11:52.240] - Nicole
But a word of caution. So you can have a trademark from the moment that you start using this. It is a trademark with limited protections whether or not you choose to register. But it's important to do a comprehensive search sooner rather than later. And that's because even if your trademark, let's go with your blog name, is not an exact match for another.

[00:12:15.730] - Nicole
It may be similar enough that a consumer is likely to be confused by the source of that service, or a product if you have an ecommerce store. Trademarks function to protect consumers, so think back to the beginning of the presentation where we were talking Coke versus Pepsi, Adidas versus Nike, you know other distinctions that you can think about competing, dueling products or services in the same industry. When you're walking down the marketplace, be that the grocery store, target aisles, let's talk about the cereal aisle, for example. There are hundreds of brands of cereal and you can probably differentiate between them because of their trademarks. That is the function of a trademark.

[00:13:03.710] - Nicole
So if you launch your brand without seeing if you're infringing or close enough to some other brand that's in the marketplace, you're putting yourself at risk of being on the receiving end of a cease and desist letter. Potentially, facing an expensive rebrand, because we all know how expensive it can be if we're not DIYing to bring on a website designer, a copywriter, graphic designer, all these things to launch our online business or our blog. And you may even have to hand over the profits that you earned while you were using the marking question. So a comprehensive search really is a key investment for your online business and brand. Period.

[00:13:45.730] - Nicole
End of story. That is because in trademark law, likelihood of confusion are the keywords that you need to pay attention to. A comprehensive federal, state and common law search looks to first the similarity of the mark and then the relatedness of the goods and services to determine if a likelihood of confusion exists, among other things. And we'll talk about that in a minute. But let's first focus on likelihood of confusion because this tends to be one of the biggest issues and one of the biggest reasons that we see refusals to register with the USPTO.

[00:14:22.360] - Nicole
So let's take Delta for an example. Delta Airlines, flight services, right? Delta faucet, your kitchen or bathroom sink. You're probably not going to confuse an airline service with a faucet. So the likelihood of confusion here, not a big issue, but let's say Starbucks, we all know Starbucks, right?

[00:14:48.990] - Nicole
And you decide to launch a coffee company using the name Starbucks, you just add an S. Okay? So similarity of the marks, it's the same exact mark with an extra S on the end relatedness of the goods and services, you're selling coffee in a coffee shop, you know, situation, there's a likelihood of confusion that exists. But let's take this a step further. The mark does not have to be an exact match for likelihood of confusion to exist.

[00:15:20.060] - Nicole
So different spelling, eight and eight different spelling, different words ostensibly, but perhaps they function the same in the mark. It could happen, there could be a likelihood of confusion issue. Misspelling. The common example I like to give is EZ, E-A-S-Y versus EZ. It has the same impression, although they are spelt differently, singular and plural versions.

[00:15:50.610] - Nicole
So this is the Starbucks version. Let's also turn to Nordstrom. Nordstrom, most of us know is a department store and it is of registered trademark. But one of the things I like to point out is if you go to the USPTO's website, they have the ability for you to search all of the registered trademarks, both live and dead, meaning ones that are existing trademarks and ones that were registered and for whatever reason, were either canceled or they just failed to file maintenance documents, and so they were abandoned.

[00:16:26.960] - Nicole
They also show pending application, which is good for you to be able to kind of search to see is there a likelihood of confusion issue with my mark? But this is a big bet, if you go, it's called the trademark electronic search system or test on USPTO's website and you type in Nordstrom, that extracts on the end and that basic search function, nothing's going to pop up. So if you're not doing a deep dive and really doing the comprehensive search, you may think you're in the clear to be able to use Nordstrom for departing store services even though there is a registration already in place for Nordstrom. Foreign language equivalents are another thing you need to look out for.

[00:17:10.320] - Nicole
So let's say the name of your blog incorporates Luna. Well, if there's another blog that has Moon in the same order of words as your blog, that could be likelihood of confusion issue. Hyphenated and non-hyphenated versions, sticking a random hyphen or different symbols that represent letters into a trademark could be a likelihood of confusion issue. These are all things that you have to pay attention to when you're thinking about naming blog name, product name, service name, tagline, all these options that you have to use as trademarks in your online business.

[00:17:46.470] - Nicole
And the sky's the limit in terms of being creative, in terms of using trademarks. But you do want to make sure that you have the ability to use the mark. I mentioned earlier that likelihood of confusion is one of the biggest reasons that we see refusal to register at the USPTO. You know, there's other things to consider, is the mark descriptive?

[00:18:06.690] - Nicole
Is it generic? Does it fail to function as a trademark? One of the common examples that I give is for T-shirts. A lot of times people will launch any commerce brands and put T-shirts in the store. And while the market may function as a name for the ecommerce store, it's probably not going to function for T-shirts as a registration if it's just a design on the front of the shirt because it doesn't designate the source of the product or service.

[00:18:35.670] - Nicole
It's just decorative, it's ornamental. So there are a lot of things to consider and unfortunately, I don't have enough time to dive into it all. But I wanted to touch on likelihood of confusion, because I think it's the spot that I see online business owners and bloggers get tripped up the most on, because they'll have inspiration from somewhere.

[00:18:55.500] - Nicole
They run with it, they launch, without doing that deep dive search to make sure that they are in the clear. And I really want to prevent people from being on the receiving end of those cease and desist letters because it can get not only stressful but very expensive very quickly depending on, you know who's on the other side.

[00:19:15.590] - Nicole
So I'm not going to dive into the actual registration process itself, which would be a whole other 30 minutes talk since I'm time-limited today. But let's say you do the comprehensive search and find no issues. So there are two types of applications that you can choose to file with USPTO. There's both an in use application and an intent-to-use application. So in use just means that you are actually using the trademark in interstate or international commerce.

[00:19:44.800] - Nicole
So for goods, this means it's on the goods, or if it's for your ecommerce store, it's posted in the ecommerce store. And you are actually making sales. For services like your blog, by way of example, it's being used in the rendering of your blog.

[00:20:00.970] - Nicole
So you actually have a readership that marks there on the blog. It's visibly displayed and people tie your posts to your blog. An Intent to use application, and I'm going to make a case for why, I think this is one of the underused tools for online business owners is when you actually file the registration application because you have a good faith intent to use the trademark within the next six months of filing, but you're not actually using it yet. So maybe you have considered launching a blog or you've considered adding an ecommerce store to your website and you have this catchy name.

[00:20:36.700] - Nicole
You've done the search, you don't see any issues, but you want to get that protective filing date first before opening it up and sharing with the community. And I'm going to talk about why that's smart in a couple of slides, so bear with me. You would file an intent to use application. Both have different processes.

[00:20:53.830] - Nicole
Again, not talking about what the registration process looks like today, but it's important to know that there are two types of applications that you can use. And that is because how long do you think it takes from the time an application is submitted to the time it reaches registration? Just going to pause for a couple of seconds.

[00:21:15.910] - Nicole
So it used to be that you filed a registration application and you could reach registration if you had no issues come up if you didn't receive an office action, which is essentially a written correspondence from the USPTO that finds some sort of issue with your trademark application that prevents it from moving forward with registration. Six months, six months. And then came COVID and the rise of online businesses and businesses in general, and the time frame between submitting an application to registration has increased to about a year. And it is moving upward.

[00:21:56.640] - Nicole
They did recently bring on some new examining attorneys at the USPTO. They're trying to hire more. There is still a backlog. So the quicker that you move, the quicker that you file and get that protective date, the less you have to worry about because it's filed. And as I said, I can't get into registration specifics, but I do believe that an intent to use application can be an amazing tool for online businesses.

[00:22:23.190] - Nicole
And I'm going to talk about that. Why? Why does it matter for bloggers and online business owners? Now it's the unfortunate time for some horror stories that I have seen as an attorney in the online space, the first one being one that happens relatively recently. I had an online business owner company she was working with a coach, and she shared kind of this idea that she had to launch a specific product in the online business space.

[00:22:53.110] - Nicole
She didn't have a contract with this coach, which is a whole other issue that we had to talk about. We made sure that she is using contracts in her business and will be signing contracts for every professional relationship that she engages going forward. But this coach turned around and registered the market their own, started a separate part of the business, and ran with this online business owner's idea. Trademarks do not protect ideas. So let me just say that, if you have an idea, a concept, it could be protected by an NDA, which is a non-disclosure agreement or some other provision, confidentiality provision in a contract. She hadn't launched yet.

[00:23:35.040] - Nicole
It was just a discussion she had with the coach. The coach ran with it. She didn't. She had to go back to the drawing board, and it was a frustrating lesson for her. I had a blogger come to me who spent a ton of money on their website and their branding without doing a comprehensive search.

[00:23:53.160] - Nicole
So they had a catchy blog name that already existed, and they didn't poke around to see if that was true or not. They just launched and spent a pretty penny and got that cease and desist letter. And so, they not only had to take everything down and rebrand, but they had the headache and the stress of being on the receiving end of receiving this letter because they didn't do a little bit of legwork first. I had an online business owner who bought a domain name thinking that was the same thing as trademark protection. Little tip here.

[00:24:29.060] - Nicole
So if you are thinking about launching a new product, a new service, running with something else in your business, people do monitor IP hosting platforms and domain sites to see what's being purchased, to potentially go file intent to use marks and vice versa. They may monitor to see what's being filed as an intent to use or any application, and then go try and do a search for domains, try and tie them up. They're not the same thing, but it can be a headache. So this online business owner bought the domain, started doing a bunch of stuff, assumed it was trademark protection. It wasn't.

[00:25:09.180] - Nicole
She found out afterwards that there was a business owner that was using the same name, essentially, and had priorities. They've been using the mark and they had actually submitted a trademark registration application. So she had to go start rebuilding with a whole different brand and concept. I had a blogger who shared that they intended to file an intent to use application with their audience, so they had it filed. It was, again, just a concept, and they shared it publicly.

[00:25:41.160] - Nicole
Well, one of their audience members liked the idea so much that they took it verbatim and filed for registration and got an in use date first. So it's important as an online business owner to be cognizant of what you are running with in terms of your brand and your business. Because you want to make sure that if you're drawing that figurative line in the sand, if you're building that community and that goodwill, it's not on borrowed ground. Side note, you also want to make sure that you are sharing with people that you're comfortable with, as you have a non-disclosure agreement in place or contract with a confidentiality provision, and there's teeth, so if there's a breach, you can go after them.

[00:26:27.760] - Nicole
So put that in your pocket for future use. But these are just some of the horror stories that I've heard with business owners who fail to really put trademark registration in the forefront of their mind and factor into their business plan.

[00:26:43.660] - Nicole
So how do you know if you're ready to move forward with federal trademark registration? I have three questions that you really want to consider and ask yourself. The first being, do you have a profitable product or service? And as a blogger, let's say that you're maybe not making money off your blog per se. Maybe you are doing affiliate marketing or you have sponsorships or other things that are going on with your blog.

[00:27:05.410] - Nicole
If you are building an audience, a readership, a reach, you can factor that in here as well. Number two is do you intend to stick with your product or service? So if the timeline to reach registration with the USPTO is a year, and this is something that you're just kind of launching to see that sticks and it, you know, may go away in six months, chances are you may not want to submit for registration. If it is something to where you're building a legacy. And this blog is going to be something that you have for years and years to come, or your online business with an Ecommerce store and you really want to build this thing big and be able to maybe sell it down the line, you want to factor that into your decision making.

[00:27:49.210] - Nicole
And finally, do you plan to stop others from infringing on your trademark? So getting to the registration point is amazing, getting that shiny certificate, although news flash, we don't get hard copies of your trademark registration anymore with the fancy gold seal on them. Unfortunately, now it is an electronic copy and even if you order courtesy copy, a display copy of the certificate, it's truncated, so it's definitely not as pretty. And there's been some rumbling behind the scenes trying to get the USPTO to change that to at least make the display copies a little bit prettier.

[00:28:23.670] - Nicole
We'll see if anything comes of that. But once you reach registration, you also want to make sure that you're putting other people on notice that you're not comfortable if they get too close to your mark or if they start to infringe on your rates. So this is something to maybe sit down with a trademark attorney and talk about and how that factors into your online business or your blog planning, you know. Are you to be having somebody that's monitoring to make sure that there's no potentially infringing applications being filed or setting up a Google alert is a great way, and it's no cost to you as a business owner. You know you put the phrase or the name in Google alert and have it send you a weekly email updating you on any use of these, so that you can kind of monitor.

[00:29:06.540] - Nicole
But you do want to make sure that you're telling people, no, you can't infringe on my marks because you have the obligation as a trademark owner to protect that mark or potentially face, you know, the counter arguing that you've kind of diluted the strength of your mark if you haven't protected it. So those are the three questions as you're contemplating if this is something you want to move forward with to kind of consider. Can you conduct a search and apply for registration on your own? Yes. That's the short answer. Of course, you can. You can go to the USPTO's website.

[00:29:38.610] - Nicole
There are a plethora of resources. Like I said, you can use that test system, the trademark electronic search system to poke around and see if there are any likelihood of confusion issues. It's not as easy as it looks. I will say, even as an attorney who's done the Boolean searches, because that's what it is, there's a whole search method. It's not that easy, quite frankly.

[00:30:02.510] - Nicole
And to really go in and identify potential likelihood of confusion issues, look at existing trademark law, and decide if there is a genericism issue, if there is a descriptiveness issue, you know, if it's really truly functioning as a trademark. I believe that working with a trademark attorney is one of the best investments that you can make for your online business, for your blog. Because it ensures that you get much better guidance and advice. There is a much smoother and less stressful experience of being able to work with a professional who understands the registration process, and you actually have an increased chance of getting to a successful registration. Because they have that knowledge of trademark law, all the nuances, what the process looks like, which I know, you know because of time constraints we couldn't get into today. But there's much more than just submitting an application and getting to registration.
