Alex Waggoner [00:00:12]:
Hello. Hello. And welcome to the training for taking overwhelm from overwhelm to taking quick action project management system every blogger needs. I'm so excited to help you get your blogging systems organized so you can quickly scale into a successful blog in 2025. So a quick introduction. Hello. I am Alex. I'm an online business manager at Tech VA for the past 5 years, and here are a few key things to remember me by if you ever see my name pop up in the online space.

Alex Waggoner [00:00:42]:
So I'm a verified ClickUp consultant. I adore ClickUp, and you will be hearing some tips I have as far as using ClickUp, to streamline some of your systems and workflows. And I also love travel. It's the reason I started my online business. My brand is about it it's a nomadic entrepreneur. I love travel and I've had the privilege of working remotely from 15 countries and counting and yes I think it is incredible how we have this location independence available to us. And I also love a scary movie, it is my favorite genre of movies. And I'm a huge astrology nerd with my big three being a, Sagittarius sun, Virgo Moon, and Gemini rising.

Alex Waggoner [00:01:22]:
So let's dive into the good stuff, shall we? So today, we'll get we're gonna be talking about the challenges bloggers face with project management, the benefits of having those strong project management skills in place and how they can impact your success, essential tools for bloggers that will help you scale long term, some tips for staying organized, and some techniques to stay organized and productive as well. And yeah. So challenges. So any of these could be impacting your ability to scale long term. So first things first, of course, is managing content production. That is the number one skill that is required to take that hobby into a career. It's it can be overwhelming at first to try to keep track of all those little bits and bobs of information when it comes to creating high quality content. I will be showing you a template or included in this training is a free template for my tried and true blog post tracker.

Alex Waggoner [00:02:22]:
It is how I recommend keeping track of all of your blog posts, not only when you first create them, but to maintain them long term because that is one piece of blog post management is we forget that we also need to go back and update things and managing that production of not only just initial creation, but maintenance and updates is part of that challenge. So you're most likely not just posting content in your blog as well. You also probably have additional, you know, social media channels that you wanna share your content on Pinterest. There's all of these different areas that we need to scatter our content on the internet in order to reach the most amount of people. So getting that system is definitely a strong challenge. And maybe you also have things like writing, like you have a team of writers, that's also a pretty common thing that you might have as far as your content production goes. So there's a lot of different bits and bobs that you need to keep track of when creating content. Collaborations is another additional challenge that you have to keep track of.

Alex Waggoner [00:03:23]:
So you'll be once you get started and really start to build up a momentum as far as your traffic goes, you'll start to get guest posts and then additional digital events like this one, like a summit or bundle, and you want to make sure you have all of that information organized and set up for success so you can look professional long term. So you can meet meet certain due dates and remember all of the different places that you've been that you have shown up long term. And then another additional thing is time management, once you start doing this path you become self employed in some capacity and how you spend your time is directly connected to your income when you're fully self employed. If you're just getting started, even just like a little bit, having good time management skills is essential, especially if you're only you only have, like, 5 hours a week to dedicate to your blog, then having good time management skills is essential. You want to have a clear idea for how long your tasks will take and how to fit those into your calendar, which we will talk a bit about shortly. Benefits. So some benefits of having strong project management skills. So we just discussed the challenges that you can face as a blogger getting started or even just as a blogger who is already working and you could already have a ton of, like, a pretty high level traffic skill and you want to focus on scaling to that next level of your income and impact.

Alex Waggoner [00:04:58]:
So some benefits of having these strong project management skills in place to take you from being overwhelmed to just executing is increased output as a creator. So once you have clear systems in place, it's easier and you can your brain can kind of turn off and you can just start creating once you have a clear system in place. And you can also relax because you have that externalized brain that you trust. Right? So it's more it's not just having like a list of blog post, a list of blog posts to keep track of which if that's enough, then that's enough. Right? But what we want is a system that we can trust through those project management skills so we don't have to second guess anything that we have as far as our systems go. It's also easier to outsource to a virtual assistant. Once you get to a certain point where you've built up enough income or you just have a little extra money to invest into your blog, you might want to consider outsourcing to a virtual assistant to help you with some of those more mundane tasks that there's there's always a lot of little bits and bobs you have to keep track of with the tech, with the updating text, with, you know, link management, all of that kind of stuff. It's just helpful to have that second person to support you.

Alex Waggoner [00:06:18]:
It also has increased it increases your professionalism, you're organized, you meet your deadlines, and all of that jazz, and it is easier to be flexible and adaptable with your new ideas when you have systems and project management skills in place to quickly be able to assess whether or not you can say yes to something. And yeah. So essential project management tools for bloggers. So the first thing, when it comes to being a blogger, there are a couple of tools that are a part of included in your what I call your operations suite, which is a specific tech stack that helps you manage the operations of your blog slash business. And one thing that I think is very important here is to make that mindset swap from blog as a hobby, you know, just like a passion project to a business. And once you make that step and that mental conversion, then it can the importance of these tools kinda falls into place. So first things first is your task and project management tool. Naturally, I recommend ClickUp, but there are a couple of other options that I recommend depending on the person.

Alex Waggoner [00:07:32]:
Everyone's different, and some other additional options worth exploring are Notion and Airtable. And then additionally, we have your communication tool. So this is essential when you start outsourcing and working with other people, whether that is with a virtual assistant, a branding company, a copywriter, a blog, like a writer's team if you have a team of people, a couple of tools I recommend for that are Slack and Voxer depending on the robustness of your team. If you have a larger team then I would definitely use Slack, but Voxer is also good for anything, like, if it's just like a quick couple of people, you know, I would say max, like, 2 people on a team in addition to yourself, but otherwise, I would use Slack, just to keep everything outside of your personal world versus, like, a text or email. It's I can go on about this for a while, but the main thing is get it out of your email or your text messages because you wanna have those work life balance boundaries, and then additionally, your time management tool. So this is doesn't have to be anything fancy. I recommend Google Calendar, but essentially, it's your calendar tool that you use because I recommend time blocking out your time so you can visually see where you're spending your time. And that includes, like, if you're working a full time job, I would include, like, time blocking that out in your calendar so you can see visibly what you have time to complete.

Alex Waggoner [00:09:03]:
So when you're setting your goals, you're not just, like, throwing spaghetti at a wall and hoping it sticks, and instead you're being intentional with, like, okay. I know I only have 5 hours this week to dedicate to my blog. I can't expect myself to produce 30 blog posts that are high quality. Maybe you can if you're a a champion at producing blog post content but depending on your workload, that's just it's one of those things where you need to assess what you're capable of producing and connecting that to time and when you gain that skill, it will really help you scale long term. And then lastly is your content calendar tool. This can sometimes be, like, integrated with your task and project management tool. The system I am showing you is integrated into ClickUp, which it can also be a task and project management tool, but it's really helpful to have, like, a visual content calendar so you can see, like, when content is going live, especially if you have, like, multiple platforms that you're posting content on, like email marketing, social media, all of that. So you can get that, like, overarching view of what's going on in your content.

Alex Waggoner [00:10:09]:
And yeah. So next, let's talk about tips for staying organized, not just to get organized, but to stay organized using your systems because that's really the goal. It's not just, like, one goal or being organized isn't just one achievement that you hit and then you're done. It is an ongoing process which can be met through having clear systems in place. One way I like to do this is through brain brain dumps. So getting information out of your head and into, like, some externalized documented format so you can, go through when creating your project plans and all of that. So I prefer using a Notion database to collect my ideas because it's you can have, the widgets on your phone, I have an iPhone, I don't, I would imagine you can do this on Androids as well but if you get the widget for Notion on your phone where you can have like the favorited, pages on the widget, you can bookmark that so then it's really easy to just open that up real quick and then make note of whatever your idea is. So you can set reminders to, like, every week go through your brain dump list so you can see, like, okay, where do I have, like, blog post ideas? Because sometimes it's not only just, like, blog post content, right? Like it might be, like, a digital product ideas, it might be, I don't know, you want to redesign your bathroom.

Alex Waggoner [00:11:31]:
Right? Like, there's it's a place for you to just, like, externalize your brain so you don't forget things. And having, like, a system to remind you to go back and check it every week or every month can be helpful to keep you organized and out of your head. And then next tip for staying organized is store everything in one place. I think this is a good rule of thumb for just everything in your digital world of files and ecosystem things, because the main reason for this is you don't wanna have to update information in multiple places. So if you have, especially if you have a team, this can be overwhelming to have like multiple places to update, you know, like the blog post title is one thing that I would consider here. Now, of course, in certain places, it's unavoidable to I'm thinking, okay. So in a blog post tracker, of course, you'll have the blog post title in your site, like, on whatever's published on your site, and then in your tracker, you can set up things with automations to connect things, but I definitely recommend having, like, a tracker to remember and sort, like, statuses for your blog posts, but you'll want to just have 1. Like, I wouldn't have multiple lists, like, if you have a blog post writing team, I wouldn't have multiple spreadsheets where you have to update, you know, like, okay, this is one like, I would have it in one system that you can easily keep track of and just train everybody on it as opposed to, like, having different customized solutions for every single person.

Alex Waggoner [00:13:13]:
It'll just reduce your headache a lot, long term because you won't have to train yourself in 5 different ways and you will just have one system that's easy to easy to remember. And then next is to create a roadmap. Now I know that might not be the most intuitive for, like, staying organized, but it is actually very helpful because when you get into this energy of planning ahead your plan might shift and that's okay but having that long term vision to work towards is really helpful to make sure you're continuing to meet that goal. Because sometimes when we say we wanna get organized, we get overwhelmed by all of the options to, like, have to clean up, but if you create a road map and you're like, okay, I just wanna make sure that my blog post system is organized and easy to follow by the end of this quarter, like that's your quarterly goal, it's a lot easier to, you know, like keep that self confidence, keep that momentum going as opposed to being like I want my entire business organized by the end of the quarter. And depending on the state of your business, that might not be a a an achievable goal. And that's okay. Right? Like, we are allowed to pick away at things versus just being, like, suddenly perfect. So, yes, creating a roadmap will help you stay organized long term.

Alex Waggoner [00:14:30]:
So next steps, how to start taking action and actually implementing this into your business. The first thing I would recommend doing is tracking your time to get real how long something takes for you. So I would do this with writing blog posts, I would do this for managing team members if you have a team, I would do this for any kind of bit and bob that you'd work on for your blog and when it comes to even like writing a blog, I would break it down to like writing the blog post and then like the tech setup or like any of that kind of more admin stuff and maybe designing a blog post if you do a lot of photos, Like, if you're a travel blogger who has a lot of, like, you know, custom photos that you work through and all of that, like, you wanna make them very I mean, I wouldn't go insane, but yeah. Now I'm thinking maybe having design. Like, designing your blog post is the tech. You know? Like, so setting up all of the, like, making sure all the tracking elements are correct and all of that. So boiling down to make sure you track your time so you can get real on how long something takes. So when you time block out your calendar, you know what you need to do.

Alex Waggoner [00:15:40]:
Next is create that roadmap specifically on a quarterly basis. What do you want to complete every single goal for the next year for 2025? What would you like to achieve by the end of Q1, Q2, Q3, and Q4? That's a whole another training in itself, but it's a good thing to start training your brain into thinking in those quarterly milestones. And then choosing a content management tool. So if you haven't established one already, this is essential because you want to make sure you have a clear system for managing your content. I will show you briefly the ClickUp template that I have, but I think that this is an essential step in your process of being a blogger. And then finally, implement and adjust. So we want to have a growth mindset with this process as opposed to just not doing it correctly the first time and then never doing it again. It's okay to not follow a plan perfectly.

Alex Waggoner [00:16:42]:
It's okay to not achieve a goal. It is okay to write down a goal at the beginning of a quarter and then never look at it again. But we still wanna go back and we still wanna make sure we are working towards these goals of tracking your time, creating a roadmap, and using a content management system, because it will benefit you greatly as you start to scale your blog. And yes. So let's look at the click up templates for bloggers very quickly. I'm gonna pause my recording one sec. Alright. So if you're not familiar with ClickUp, this is what ClickUp looks like.

Alex Waggoner [00:17:20]:
And I have a few different resources for how to use ClickUp on my site, so definitely check that out. If you're like, I have no no idea where to even begin with this, don't worry. I'm not gonna focus too much on the basics for this just to show you kinda, like, the things that are helpful as a blogger. But if you're new to ClickUp, definitely check out my site. So the first thing I would like for y'all to see is there's these 3 different views here. So this little light bulb, this is the place where anything that is an idea, this is where your blog post ideas go, Any blog post that you're currently working on creating is here and then all of your published ones will go here. Now how ClickUp works is each row in a list is a task. So this is one task, but I also want you to kind of think of like this as more of a database for the purpose of this template.

Alex Waggoner [00:18:15]:
So this individual, task is 1 blog post and how this works. So there's a couple of custom fields here where you can keep track of all of this information as far as, you know, like the status of the blog post. So like if this blog post was set to the status of idea or published or needs updates, it would go to the according corresponding view up here. So if it was under the idea status, it would go over here. I'll show you that real quick. And then if it was under published, it would go here. We're not gonna do that. I'll ignore that for now.

Alex Waggoner [00:18:56]:
It will be over here. So this helps you keep track of that bird's eye view of what blog posts you currently have. Now when you open up this blog post or this task, excuse me, you'll see that there is actually I'm gonna show you real quick. You'll see first that there's this 0 to 27, 0-27, bit here, this is a checklist. This shows that there's a checklist inside of this task. So it's all of the little, like, bits and bobs you need to keep track of when doing a blog post. That can be found under action items if you see this 3 bars here or just continue to scroll down in the task and you'll find all of the all of the checklists. There's a couple of different phases as far as creating a checklist goes and that includes like writing the post.

Alex Waggoner [00:19:44]:
Right? Like so we have headline titles, actually drafting the post itself, and then there's all of the bits you have to do for confirming the tech is ready to go, right? So like updating the categories, confirming authors, updating the permalink so whatever you link to on your site, like all of these little bits and bobs that we might forget, this is how you capture that to make sure you're actually achieving everything you wanna get done for your blog post. I'm not gonna go through every single bit here. If you have any questions, please feel free to reach out. There is an option to do that in your like where you'll find this template. And then one thing I also recommend doing is and this is overkill. This is so overkill. But I do recommend having the actual blog post copy inside of this task. So it's every single bit about your blog, that single blog post is in this task because then you can, if for whatever reason your blog goes away, like it crashes or you lose your site or for whatever reason, like that's the worst possible scenario.

Alex Waggoner [00:20:50]:
But if that does happen, you have the safeguard of still having the content. Of course, the site should hopefully be me and like hopefully that will never happen, this is just a safeguard, but it is one nice feature to keep track of everything so you don't lose that content. And yeah, so I hope that one sec. So I hope that you found a ton of different little takeaways for this from this training, and I really hope that you start implementing the use of this template. If you have any questions regarding it, please let me know and I will help you out because I know it's, it's a big tool to get started with. But, yeah, I hope you enjoy the template.
