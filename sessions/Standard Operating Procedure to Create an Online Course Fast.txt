[00:00:00.000] - Liz Stapleton
All right, guys. I'm super thrilled to do this session with Suzi, who's going to be talking about creating courses, which as bloggers, there's different levels of where you're at. But eventually you get to product creation and courses are a great way to go about it. Welcome, Suzi.

[00:00:19.540] - Suzi Whitford
Thank you so much, Elizabeth.

[00:00:21.820] - Liz Stapleton
We're going to just talk through it. We're going to figure out what steps they need to take. Is there some overview things they should know before we dive in?

[00:00:32.150] - Suzi Whitford
Yeah. Hi, I'm Suzi. I blog over at Start a Mom blog. And over the last three, four years, I've created about ten Signature courses and about a total of 20 to 30 products. Some of them are a little smaller of printables and so on, and that's a great way to start as well. But before we dive into that, I have been able to generate over a million dollars with my business, which is insane. And the cost of running an online business is so small. So most of it is profit. I didn't get a team or have a VA up until three years into my business. So it was a lot of bootstrapping this from the beginning. Additionally, I had kids at home. So I started my business when I was pregnant at 37 or 38 weeks of my second baby. I had baby number two, then I had baby number three. And while I was doing this, I was launching courses and growing my business. So I want to give you guys the standard operating procedure that I used to create my courses to make it simple so that I can still live my life and tend to my most important needs, like my kids and my family while still growing this business and launching amazing products.

[00:01:46.150] - Liz Stapleton
Yeah, I'm really excited because blogging can easily take over your life, especially if you're working full-time and doing it on the side still or whatnot. And the thing is, life is for living, not just for blogging. You need to get into blogging to have it take over your life. So I like that you're like, I did it so that I could maintain my life and the things that are important. So I think that's fantastic. So what made you choose courses as your product? Because obviously there's lots of different things you can do, and I said you have lots of products. And what was the benefit of that route?

[00:02:19.670] - Suzi Whitford
Well, so courses, the perceived value that students get from it is huge. Unlike a printable or a small ebook, which are great lead-ins to a course, a course is more you're learning from the person. Most of the time there's videos, there's a lot of material. You get access and you can take it at your own pace. So for students, a course is very valuable because they're building that connection with you. And many of us are used to school, right? Being taught by a professor, being taught by a teacher. So it's a natural transition to then do it as an adult, but then in the flexibility of your day. Yeah.

[00:03:00.630] - Liz Stapleton
And then how do you decide... Because I feel like this is where a lot of people get stuck and also where things can fall flat. How do you decide what to do a course on?

[00:03:10.450] - Suzi Whitford
That is a very big question. So all my students, I teach them how to start their blogs. And then eventually, when I became very successful with course creation, I started teaching that as well. And my students have done amazing with that. But the reason or what I tell them is to put in their course is the how, the detailed steps, step by step, how you would actually take somebody and hold their hand and walk them through the problem, where your blog or your website is more for the what and the why. And then your course is the exact how steps.

[00:03:45.190] - Liz Stapleton
Okay, that's a great point. So blog is what and why and course is how. So is choosing the topic the first step in the standard operating procedure, would you say, or is there like a step before that?

[00:03:56.280] - Suzi Whitford
Oh, yeah. So before you even think about course or product creation, the most important thing you can do is grow your audience, is listen to your audience, engage with them. Even if you only have 100 people on your email list, email them and ask them for feedback. Ask questions in your emails. If you don't know what to write in your weekly newsletters, just ask a question. Share something personal about yourself and ask something about them. And then as you're growing your niche, you'll start learning what their biggest struggles and problems are, and then start thinking about product creation. So your most important thing before you launch a course is to build that audience and build engagement with them. And then when you're ready to launch the course, you could survey your audience. You could do one-on-one interviews with them. You could do a Facebook Live where you're just engaging with people. Any way that you're getting feedback from them, that's going to give you ideas for your product. Yeah. And go ahead.

[00:04:56.030] - Liz Stapleton
I was going to say the more you know your audience because they won't come out directly, they don't know the solution they need. So it's more listening for the problems and think, do I have a solution for them? Because you'll be like, what do you want course on? They're like, I don't know. So don't go that route. Engage with them like you said, get to know them the more you know your audience. We did another session. We were like, be obsessed with your audience. Engage. Ask questions. They're your friends. They're your tribe. So I like that you taking that approach.

[00:05:26.950] - Suzi Whitford
Definitely. That's your bread and... That's your base of your foundation is your engagement and that relationship you build with people. They're not just like computers on the other side, there's real people, real emotions. And I love my audience because they're all moms and they're very emotional and we have all our hearts and our sleeves because our kids. So I just love it because we're just so as all people loving. But you know. So what I would suggest before you dive into creating a course is you start engaging with your audience. You learn what they need and how you can help them in that problem. Then I would suggest creating a small printable, like a small $10 product or a small ebook under $50, maybe- I'm.

[00:06:07.700] - Liz Stapleton
Going to test that area. Yeah.

[00:06:10.880] - Suzi Whitford
So create a small product first and see if they take it. See if they like it. See if they actually purchase. Kind of warm up your audience to buying from you to building that trust. And then once you see, okay, they're building or they're purchasing the small product, they're purchasing the small ebook, then you can slowly start creating that course with videos and worksheets and a ton more material in it. But before you invest two months into creating a course, start with a smaller product.

[00:06:42.090] - Liz Stapleton
Yeah. I may or may not back a year or two after I started a blog, and they have launched a course to crickets. That's okay. So back in my early days, I'm definitely familiar with that, unfortunately. And so once you got that buy in from them, literally, which that money should also help you in providing you with the resources you need to build a course because it could be a little more involved with software to do video, even if it's screen shared stuff. What does that... Do you suggest? Like a beta launch? Do you suggest how... What would the next step be? They've got the buy in, they know the topic. Where do you go from there?

[00:07:26.830] - Suzi Whitford
All right. So I have done some beta launches for my courses where I had the idea, I had a small product that was doing well, and then I beta launched a course idea. I'm going to sell this course, it's going to come out in two months, and that also puts a deadline on me. So it holds me accountable because I just told the entire audience I'm going to do this in two months. I better finish this in two months. So I beta launched a couple. I'm not a big fan of beta launching. I think it's a great strategy, but I just feel like it's so much work. If you've already tested out your idea with a small product, you've warmed up your audience, you can go ahead and start telling them that you're going to create a course. Start telling them you're going to create something a little bit better for them, a little bit more intense with more helpful tutorials. Then when you launched a course, launch it at a little bit of a discount. So that is an incentive for people to sign up that week that you launch it, add some bonuses, add a couple of different other features so that people get it for that launch week.

[00:08:26.620] - Suzi Whitford
But not the biggest... I do beta launches, but I feel like it's double the work. Like you've already did a little product, you do a beta launch and then you launch a product. And sometimes that just gets.

[00:08:36.250] - Liz Stapleton
Okay. And I did want to touch on because there's a big difference between creating the course and launching it.

[00:08:42.950] - Suzi Whitford
Oh, yeah.

[00:08:43.870] - Liz Stapleton
So do you want to dive into, okay, what action steps are you doing to create the course? And then how do you then move to the launch phase? Because those are both beasts.

[00:08:55.310] - Suzi Whitford
Yes. So there's a couple of different elements that comes before you actually launch a course. So about three or four months before I know I'm going to create a course, I would start talking to my audience about it. Just warm them up. Maybe once a month I would talk about it. And as we get closer, I would mention it in my weekly email. So number one, make sure that your audience knows that something is coming. You don't want to launch something and they're like, Oh, where did this come from? Then in the course creation process, and this is the process that I follow, this is a standard operating process that I've used to create my courses is I take that time and I start outlining it. That's the first thing I do. It might be on a notebook, might be on a piece of paper, but just start brainstorming the outline for the course. How are you going to get them from point A to point B to actually solve that problem? So that when they go through your course, they have somewhat of a transformation. Even if it's small, even if you're just helping them lose five pounds, or helping them write a little bit faster, or helping them do their first Facebook Live.

[00:10:00.870] - Suzi Whitford
One of my students is really successful. She helps moms have natural births. So instead of having Medicaid births. So that's a clear transition and transformation that the person goes through. But for a month or so, I would just brainstorm the outline. Once I have the outline done, I would write it down on a Word Doc or a Google Doc, and I would start doing the text lectures. So what text can I put into each lecture? Which lecture needs text? Which one doesn't? Sometimes I do this in Google Docs. I would start, but a lot of times I just start doing it in Teachable. That's a platform I use to create my courses just because it's already nicely organized and they're in their lectures. So outline, text lectures, then I would create any worksheets, complementary resources, any physical, technical PDFs that go along with the course or calculators or spreadsheets. Then lastly, I would record my videos because a lot of times in the videos, I'm referencing the PDFs or I'm referencing the different lectures. So you want to make sure you do the videos way last because they're also the hardest to redo and to edit and to all get done.

[00:11:14.720] - Suzi Whitford
But once I have my outline, my text lectures, my PDFs, my videos, upload it all into teachable, go through it, make sure everything looks good, and then I start creating the sales pages.

[00:11:26.130] - Liz Stapleton
Okay. And we do have some sessions on sales page creation for sure. So you are using teachable. What are you using, though, to create all that? You mentioned Google Docs, but what are you using to shoot your videos, to edit them? Because sometimes videos are... You're facing the camera, sometimes it's the screen. What tools are you using and what made you decide to go with those ones?

[00:11:53.920] - Suzi Whitford
Sure, definitely. So hardware, I use a ring light. You don't have to. One of my courses, I sat in front of a nice lit window with my cell phone. So you can start off like- You can bootstrap. Right, you can bootstrap. That was perfectly fine. Right now I have a ring light, a webcam, and the microphone, but that's pretty much it. Then for software, I was between Screencastomatic and Camtasia. Camtasia is around $300 a year or $300 for the entire license, but it's pretty pricey, where Screencastomatic is $15 per year. It's fantastic. You can do the screen sharing. You can do full face on the video. It's very easy to edit it. Camtasia has a little bit more capabilities of doing fancy overlays and making it look more fancy. But you know what? People are enrolling on your course not for how fancy your things look, but to get the transformation. So Screencastomatic does 80 % of what you need. Also, what's a perk about Screencastomatic is when you are done editing it, you can watch it on two times speed and then edit it that way and cut out any silences or any places you mess up, where in Camtasia, you have to watch it at the same speed that you spoke, and that takes twice as long.

[00:13:16.860] - Suzi Whitford
Got you.

[00:13:17.410] - Liz Stapleton
No, that's a great point. I don't use either of those. I use something else, but I like it. But I'm also like, well, I know how to use the one I use. Which one do you use? I use Screenflow. Oh, cool. I think I've heard of it. It's a similar idea of ScreenTests, but it's like... So I bought it years ago and it's a one time cost. You can always upgrade when they come up with a new one and pay for the upgrade. I've just been using the one I paid for. I think it was like a hundred bucks, so it's not cheap, but it's not yearly either. Right. You know, everything has its pros and cons. But yeah, because I think it's always important to understand course creation. Typically you can bootstrap it pretty cheaply, but you've got to be aware there is going to be some cost to that. And then teachable, I would assume, hosts your videos.

[00:14:05.120] - Suzi Whitford
Yes. So teachable, there's different ways that you can actually create your courses and then lock down the membership and accept payments. So you can do it all on your WordPress website with a couple of different tools connected together. There's programs like Thinkific, Teachable, Kajabi. There's all-in-one solutions like ClickFunnels or Kartra. So there's a lot of platforms. You just decide on the right one for you and try not to overcomplicate it. So teachable works for me.

[00:14:36.450] - Liz Stapleton
Yeah, I use Podia, but I remember teachable and it was Fedora. I've used them in the past too. They've built a really great platform. So it's whatever's going to work best for you and everyone's a little different. I like to think of it as like Apple versus the Android, right? They're both great, but some people just gravitate to one or the other.

[00:14:55.030] - Suzi Whitford
Exactly. Yeah.

[00:14:57.090] - Liz Stapleton
Okay. So then once you've built your course and you got your sales page, which we won't dig too much into that unless there's some points you really want to make because we do have sessions on sales page. Yeah, that's fine. What is the launch look like?

[00:15:12.020] - Suzi Whitford
All right. So depending on how pricey the course is. So if it's something that's like $20 or less, you don't have to push that much. It's an easy sell. You can probably write a couple of emails, maybe do one live. That's good. If it's something like $100 close to that range and depending on how price sensitive your audience is. So $100 for my audience is a lot of money. So that would be a legit launch for me. I would email my list a couple of times about it. I would warm them up the months before. I would also have a very segmented part of my list that I know they're interested in the course. So yes, my entire list would hear about it, but that smaller segment of my list would hear more about it. So a recent launch I did was my entire list is at that time was around 40,000, and the smaller part of the list was 700 people. So a very small percentage of that. But with that 700 people, I think I made over $70,000 a month for total. So even though it was a small list or a small segment.

[00:16:20.400] - Suzi Whitford
So during launch week, I would have my two lists that I would talk to. I would write multiple emails. I would do multiple Facebook Lives so that people can see me and see me sell the product. I've never been really good at webinars where people know they're signing up and they're about to get sold. I just clam up and I just am not really good at that. I know it's a great strategy. It just doesn't work for me. So I do Facebook Lives where I'm much more casual and relaxed, and I can tell people about my.

[00:16:51.200] - Liz Stapleton
Product-you're audience-talking because you're like that, right? People that are your people are going to get it, and I'll be fine.

[00:16:58.140] - Suzi Whitford
They're going to be like, What's this webinar? Suzi doesn't do webinars. I do Facebook Lives so people can ask me questions. I have expiring bonuses during my first week that I launched it. I definitely have a price increase during that first week, and I would recommend doing a launch. What works for me is from Monday to Friday. I once did a launch, I think it was from Wednesday to Sunday. And once the weekend hit, I could just feel the engagement drop because my audience are moms and they're busy with their families. And ending my launch on a Sunday was a bad idea. So for future references, think about your audience. Are they... Maybe they're at their corporate jobs all week and on the weekends they're freer. So maybe that's good for you. For mine, my audience is a little bit more in structure during the week, and on the weekends it's like family. So for me, my future launches will be from Monday to Fridays, and those do much better for me.

[00:17:54.370] - Liz Stapleton
Okay. Yeah. And then so I want to ask because you mentioned a launch week. So do youhow do you decide... Okay, a couple of questions in one, I guess. Because launch week, does it become unavailable after that? Do you do Evergreen? What dictates that launch week?

[00:18:13.030] - Suzi Whitford
So launch week is the first time it's open for sale ever, and it starts off with a little bit of a discount. So people who trust me, who like me, who don't take a chance, but are invested early.

[00:18:27.980] - Liz Stapleton
They get the-I have people that are like, Oh, you can... Something new. Here's my money. Let me have that.

[00:18:32.180] - Suzi Whitford
They already know you. They know they're going to get a little bit of incentive. So launch week is... Yeah, it's awesome. It's a little bit of a discount. But then after that, it's open and people can enroll when they want to. I might run sales throughout the year, but never as low as what launch week was. Launch week is always the lowest that I ever offered.

[00:18:55.870] - Liz Stapleton
Okay. And then what you mentioned, bonuses also during launch week. What bonuses do you typically do or recommend or suggest to go with your launch?

[00:19:06.350] - Suzi Whitford
Yeah, it's a great question. Anything that makes them get to that transformation faster. So the course probably that you're creating already has tons of videos, and that takes time. So bonuses work really well if it helps you get through that content faster. So maybe like a cheat sheet that goes with the course, maybe some done-for-you templates. There is a big bundle that's sold every year called ultimate bundles, and it's 65 courses and it's insane and it's so much content. But the bonus that they have that goes really well with it or like a to upsell, is the cheat sheets for each course. So if you can create some way where people can go through your course, but at a faster pace like Cliff notes, those work really well as bonuses.

[00:19:57.350] - Liz Stapleton
Swipe, copy, things like that. Okay. Yeah. And then because another thing blogger space is time. So you've created the course and then where do you fit in creating bonuses? How does that balance? Or where do you squeeze that in? Do you need to be ready at launch day or can you be like by the end of launch or by the end of next week they'll be ready or something?

[00:20:21.530] - Suzi Whitford
Normally if they're PDFs, they're a file, I would have those already done because I'm more excited about them. You could also if you run out of time and you don't have a bonus to offer, you could offer a future bonus, like get on a coaching call with me, like a group coaching call, or everybody who is on who gets it during launch week gets something special that you promised in the future, but it's more personal with you, engagement, if you don't have that PDF.

[00:20:50.330] - Liz Stapleton
Right now. Okay. Yeah, group coaching videos one on one time or something like that.

[00:20:56.910] - Suzi Whitford
I'll review your course or I'll help you with your process, or let me look at your birth story or your birth plan and we'll talk about it if you're selling a birth course.

[00:21:07.240] - Liz Stapleton
Sure. So you say the launch is always the lowest price, but how much lower is it from what the final price is going to be usually as a percentage? Is it just depends on the course?

[00:21:18.310] - Suzi Whitford
Like around 40 %.

[00:21:20.610] - Liz Stapleton
40 % cheaper than the launch? Yeah. Okay.

[00:21:22.880] - Suzi Whitford
That would be the highest I would go. And then because sales throughout the year, I can go as low as like 30 % off my products.

[00:21:31.740] - Liz Stapleton
Okay. Yeah, that makes sense. Okay, so 40 % cheaper. And then you said you'd always do a price increase during launch. Is that in between the final price and the lowest?

[00:21:42.160] - Suzi Whitford
So I've done some crazy launches where the first 100 people got it for one price and then the rest of the launch was at another price. And then at the end of the launch, it was a big price.

[00:21:52.470] - Liz Stapleton
That was fun.

[00:21:53.770] - Suzi Whitford
Yeah, that was really fun to do that. But if it's your first launch, don't try to overcomplicate it with different tiers of pricing. Just have your launch price and then your full price.

[00:22:04.890] - Liz Stapleton
Okay. Yeah. If you want to throw another one in there rather than getting complicated with a bump sale, which I think is what it's called, you can always be like, three days later, hey, guys, it's going up to something like 20 % off or something or whatever before you get to that final price. But just make it a date as opposed to a number of purchasers.

[00:22:21.470] - Suzi Whitford
Yeah, it was crazy. So I built up all this excitement for the course. And then I said the first 100 people would get at this price, and it was gone like 10 minutes.

[00:22:31.580] - Liz Stapleton
I.

[00:22:31.840] - Suzi Whitford
Had to sit there and refresh, refresh, refresh, and like, Okay, coupon code expires. Done. We're gone. And people were asking. It was a lot of fun. Yeah.

[00:22:40.920] - Liz Stapleton
And that's a great way to drive scarcity and get people to take action, which is one method of getting them to purchase the course. There's a lot of that psychology and various things you could do. But one thing I did want to touch on is I feel like a lot of people face mindset issues when it comes to creating a course. And this is just sometimes a fear of failure, but it's also sometimes a fear of success. So you have a lot of students that you've helped launch courses. What are some of the struggles they've had? And maybe things people should be aware of so they can overcome them?

[00:23:17.650] - Suzi Whitford
I think the biggest struggle is sending that first email and asking people to buy something from you. It's very scary. So that's why I highly suggest to my students who have those mindset issues to start with something small. Start with small e-book, small printable, maybe a small mini course if you are willing to go ahead and pay for the nice software to host that. But if you don't want to pay for teachable or think of it or whatnot, you can start with a small e-book. But that helps build your confidence. So if you can sell a five-dollar e-book and some people are getting engagement and you like it and they're giving you good reviews, then you can sell a $15 e-book plus workbook or e-book plus printable, and then it can slowly progress from there. But I think it's just like starting a little smaller and building your confidence that way instead of thinking, Okay, I only have 100 people on my email list. I want to create a course on this. I've never sold a product before. I don't know how to do funnels or sales pages or launch. So just start smaller and build your confidence there.

[00:24:19.740] - Suzi Whitford
Okay.

[00:24:21.000] - Liz Stapleton
So obviously there are some that because of various mindset issues, they never take action or they never get to the point of launching. Any suggestions on how they can break through that to take the action to do the things? I mean, they're on the summit, which is great.

[00:24:40.290] - Suzi Whitford
It's a.

[00:24:40.690] - Liz Stapleton
Good first step, but what else should they do?

[00:24:45.190] - Suzi Whitford
Golly, just think about what's the worst that's going to happen. So you email your list, you created a small ebook, nobody buys. You're like, okay, well, maybe I'll do a little something different. Maybe I'll start with a printable. Maybe I'll just focus on affiliate marketing. Maybe I'll continue growing my email list. But nothing bad is going to happen. There's no lion that's going to eat us. We get stronger if we go through these failures. There's lots of times that I have- You.

[00:25:13.010] - Liz Stapleton
Learn a lot more from failing than succeeding

[00:25:14.450] - Suzi Whitford
 yeah, and I know it's scary, but it's okay. We all are afraid. Like, even people who've done this for a long time. I recently launched something last week that was around $15, and I'm like, I wonder if somebody's going to buy it. I wonder if they like it. I hope they like it. And I'm like, if they don't like it, then nobody will buy it, or then I'll just create something better. But yeah, there's a lot of things that I've done that have failed, and it's okay. And the.

[00:25:44.060] - Liz Stapleton
Thing is, one of the great things when you've done it a long time, so I've been working for over five years, is when you work on something, then you're like, Wait, I think I have something that could go along with this, and it could be a bonus later on. When you get to bigger stuff or whatever, and you're like, Oh, wait, I don't have to create something brand new. I already created this. It's just my audience wasn't very big then no one bought it and dropped it. Bring it back. They may be totally into it now.

[00:26:08.940] - Suzi Whitford
That's a good point.

[00:26:10.130] - Liz Stapleton
So you can always reuse it for something. You could create content out of that ebook instead. If you're short on blog post, be like, let me take a picture, whatever. So worst that happens is that no one buys, but then you still create a piece content or something that you can totally use later on.

[00:26:27.540] - Suzi Whitford
Super smart.

[00:26:28.400] - Liz Stapleton
So just always something to keep in mind.

[00:26:31.510] - Suzi Whitford
I like that.

[00:26:32.950] - Liz Stapleton
Yeah, because-.

[00:26:34.880] - Suzi Whitford
You have to be stubbornly positive as an entrepreneur.

[00:26:38.370] - Liz Stapleton
I.

[00:26:39.070] - Suzi Whitford
Know we all get our negative days and we get down the dooms and we're like, I'm not good enough. But sometimes you just have to be like, you know what? I'm stubbornly positive today. I'm going to be happy. I'm going to figure this out. It's okay. Yeah.

[00:26:50.830] - Liz Stapleton
And recognizing that that nervousness doesn't go away. Like you said, you were nervous last week. I launched a preview with an upsell last week, and I made the first sale in a day or two or whatever, which I haven't started marking it yet. And I was like, that's my favorite, $39 I've earned or whatever. Just because I was like, oh, my new thing apparently it's working, right? Yeah. No, I totally hear you. And I'm nowhere in the League of you, but it's always exciting wherever you are, what level, how much you earn, stuff like that. That good feeling doesn't go away either.

[00:27:28.610] - Suzi Whitford
Right. I remember my first sale, the first ebook I sold was I created something and I sold it. I don't know how... I can't remember. I think I emailed my list about it on a Saturday night where all moms are busy on Saturday. They're busy with their kids. But anyway, I woke up Sunday morning and I had one sale. I had a sale at $17. It was so exciting. And then from there just slowly started to grow. But every little sale I remember. -yeah. I made a video for the first 100 people who bought my e-book. I made a video and I read their names, and I thanked each one. I put it on Facebook. I think it was a live. Yeah, I should probably do that again. It would probably just take a little longer now to read through all the names.

[00:28:17.250] - Liz Stapleton
Yeah, just depends. But no, that's exciting. Yeah, because the more you make them feel special. You just create a whole bubble of awesome.

[00:28:25.290] - Suzi Whitford
Oh, that's awesome. Yeah.

[00:28:27.490] - Liz Stapleton
Just came up with it. I love it. And I'll have to.

[00:28:30.570] - Suzi Whitford
Use that again. Can we put that as the title of this talk?

[00:28:33.450] - Liz Stapleton
Bubble of awesome. We'll put it in the description. Okay. That will be fine. You can maybe hashtag anything you guys want to say with this.

[00:28:44.950] - Suzi Whitford
Bubble of awesome. Yes, bubble of awesome.

[00:28:48.760] - Liz Stapleton
All right. So have we missed any steps when it comes to creating and then selling an online course? Is there anything that makes it go by faster? Because you talked about taking a good few months. You can probably create that first product quickly. But anything, any final tips or steps?

[00:29:10.930] - Suzi Whitford
Collie, so yeah, the longest thing that takes me in course creation is the outlining. And that could take you a couple of days if you know exactly know the steps from point A to point B. I just always take a little bit longer because I want to make sure they're in the right flow and then I'm covering everything. And it's not like I'm sitting down every day for two hours thinking about the outline. It's like as I'm cooking dinner or as I'm in the shower or as I'm driving, I'm like, Oh, yeah, I should add that, and I just jot it down. So the brainstorming phase takes me a little longer just because I like to do that process. But then the actual course creation phase is I would take like two weeks and be like, this is my two weeks. I'm going to spend these two weeks creating courses. I might have some people guest post on my blog, so I don't have to worry about writing content. I might already pre-schedule some newsletters, so I don't have to email people. I can just focus on course creation. You can also let your audience know, hey, I might be a little bit quieter because I'm focusing on this.

[00:30:08.990] - Suzi Whitford
Then take two weeks, do the outline, write the lectures, create the printables, and then take one or two days to do all your videos because it takes a long time, especially if kids or you have a busy life to organize to have four or five hours of quiet and to do your hair, to do your makeup to look good, to have to be in a good mindset to do those videos.

[00:30:28.590] - Liz Stapleton
I'm trying to get my makeup for these videos, and I'm like, Don't be worried. Can't wait to come here. I'm not going to be able to be able to be able to be able to come.

[00:30:36.370] - Suzi Whitford
I would take one or two days to do all the video shooting and then edit them and then put them all into your course creation platform, and then just set up a part of that two weeks to get it all done. And then after that, start launching. Don't be afraid to launch because a lot of times you run into creating this awesome product, and then you're like, Okay, I'm not going to tell anybody about it. Now I'm going to be really quiet and like... So don't be afraid. I know you put a lot of effort into creating your product. You still need to save a little bit of effort to actually launch it too.

[00:31:09.400] - Liz Stapleton
Yes, for sure.

[00:31:11.610] - Suzi Whitford
Very.

[00:31:14.980] - Liz Stapleton
Few people in my experience ask for refund. They may be like, Hey, I didn't quite understand this. You're like, Oh, I can add to that. The beauty of blogging and digital products is you can always tweak them later and add more if you find that a step is missing or that people keep getting tripped up somewhere. And having people in there is going to help you identify those.

[00:31:33.260] - Suzi Whitford
Exactly.

[00:31:33.820] - Liz Stapleton
You can't do that unless they buy, so you got to speak up.

[00:31:38.800] - Suzi Whitford
Very true.

[00:31:39.540] - Liz Stapleton
To make your best product, you got to get people to buy. And then the other thing I was going to note is, when you're brainstorming, you can always bounce ideas. It's always great to have a group of blogging friends. Guys, what do you think? In a Mastermind last month, friend who's been doing a course forever, and I told her just do it. She showed us her outline and we're like, well, we think you should rearrange it this way. Because what she's teaching is an art expertise. So we're like, we'd understand it better, which is how she thinks differently. So it's just having someone you can bounce an idea off of maybe besides your audience can help you to clearly read that outline.

[00:32:21.060] - Suzi Whitford
Definitely. I agree. I bounce most of my stuff off of my husband, but not everybody has that same very techy husband that sits next to you and does your WordPress updates for you. A lot of us have family.

[00:32:32.830] - Liz Stapleton
That like, I've been doing this five years and they still don't know what I do.

[00:32:36.930] - Suzi Whitford
Okay, you're just in front of a computer. I'm like, Yep, I'm a YouTuber. Sometimes when I just say I'm a YouTuber or an influencer, they start understanding a.

[00:32:45.860] - Liz Stapleton
Little bit more. Back when I did freelance writing, I know anymore, but I'd just be like, I'm a freelancer because they could understand that. That's okay. Yeah. Well, that's great. Thank you so much. I think that gives people a lot of action steps that they can take, which is fantastic.

[00:33:02.140] - Liz Stapleton
But you do have a course course by numbers. Do you want to share with them what that is, where they can get it?

[00:33:10.310] - Suzi Whitford
Yeah. So you could just go to... Thank you. You can go to coursebynumber. Com and see the success stories of my students who have gone through course by number, making up to 20,000 a month with a birthing course or a parenting course or a Finnish language course. So there's different niches that can do really well. It's all about building that engaged audience and then launching an awesome product. Also in Course by Number, I don't just cover how to create the course and launch it. I also show you how to build that Evergreen funnel so that maybe you are not really big into doing this big launch, but you just want to sell it automatically on your blog and funnel people into it. I show you how to do that too.

[00:33:52.940] - Liz Stapleton
Yes. And the link is actually below the video. So it's on this page, you guys can go click on it. And then I think if you end up getting the All Access Pass, there's a discount for that course included exclusively for the All Access pass too. So definitely if you like this video, want to rewatch it, get the All Access pass and you'll get the discount to see these course too.

[00:34:13.620] - Suzi Whitford
Awesome. That's a good incentive. Yes.

[00:34:17.280] - Liz Stapleton
And depending on when you buy the All Access pass too, the discount may be the value of the All Access pass. I don't quite remember. But thank you, Suzi. Any final words? I appreciate the time. Anything else? Lastly...

[00:34:34.340] - Suzi Whitford
No, thank you guys so much for being here. Thank you for watching. If you have any questions for me, I'm Suzi, S-U-Z-I@startamomblog.Com.

[00:34:42.900] - Liz Stapleton
All right. Thank you so much, guys. We'll see you at the end of the session.
