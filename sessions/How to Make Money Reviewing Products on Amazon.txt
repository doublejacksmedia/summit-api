All right guys, I'm really excited for this next speaker. I got to meet her in person at a conference in 2023. She has been in the Amazon space for almost a decade, from seller to influencer, and is now working to help both sellers and influencers succeed with the Amazon Influencer Program. She's a mom of three teenagers and the founder of FluencerFruit. Big warm welcome to Liz Saunders. Liz, thank you so much for joining us.

[00:00:34.180] - Liz Saunders
Thank you, Liz. I'm so excited to be here and to join you. I was thinking about this earlier. I love how virtual events, and you've been doing this for five years now, so you were even pre the whole move with COVID and everything?

[00:00:47.240] - Liz, Host
The first one was February 2020.

[00:00:49.610] - Liz
That's so impressive. You were like, "No I got this," whatever. But I love how whether you're adding to your in-person events that you go and do, like we do FinCon, or if you are just not able to travel right now, this is such a great way to get all of this amazing content from so many different people without even leaving your house. So yeah, thank you for having me and thank you for coordinating this. Amazing. Well, I'll share my screen, and we'll get started. But today, we're going to talk a little bit about how to make money reviewing products on Amazon. And even though, Liz did my introduction, I do want to just tell you a little bit about who I am and how I got here. So, I am the mom to three teenagers. And I did start many years ago as an Amazon Associate. So if you are new to the Amazon ecosystem, the Amazon Associate Program is what they have named their affiliate program. And I tried years ago to create content, develop a blog, do whatever, and just never really found much traction for myself with the Associate Program.

[00:02:02.100] - Liz
I was friends with lots of people doing great things, I just couldn't seem to make it happen. I've messed around with Amazon KDP, which is Kindle Direct Publishing and their digital book stuff. And I have messed around with Amazon Merch as well, which is their print-on-demand product program. So safe to say, I started as a seller in 2016 and then worked for one of the seller software's, Jungle Scout, for six years. And I'm pretty just obsessed with all of the different ways you can make money on Amazon. And so that led me to Amazon Influencer, which launched in 2020 in beta, and then 2021 for on-site coming out of beta. Now, I want to say really quickly, it launched actually in 2017. So a lot of you content creators who are OG bloggers are like, "Hang on, I think I'm an influencer. Don't I know this? I have a storefront somewhere, right?" And the answer is, yes, you do. But then they needed some place to put this on-site shoppable content. And I think Amazon looked around at the ecosystem, and they were like, "We have this group of content creators over here. Let's try this with them."

[00:03:18.370] - Liz
So they did it in beta in 2020, and then they went live in 2021, which is when I joined the Amazon Influencer Program. And so I want to tell you a little bit about Influencer, how it's different from Associate. And the thing that I like to do as we get started is, when I say the word influencer, the first thing that comes to your mind is somebody who has TikTok, Instagram, Blog, and they are creating content on one of those other platforms and driving traffic to Amazon. So, for the purposes of our conversation today, I want you to take that definition and put it on a shelf, right?

[00:03:54.490] - Liz
Because Amazon has named this program Amazon Influencer, which creates a little bit of confusion because it's not that. The Amazon Influencer Program is indeed an offshoot of the Associates Program. Hence those of you OG bloggers who have had a storefront for years and years are like, "Wait a minute. It is an offshoot of that program." But when they added on-site content, it really started to change what the program is. So how is it different? Amazon Influencer allows content creators to upload content that lives on Amazon specifically, and we'll talk about some of those placements.

[00:04:33.720] - Liz
The content is uploaded, and you do get to put it on your storefront, but it also appears in other places on the Amazon, just all over the place, right? The beauty of this, so for people like me who —I've always wanted to do this, right? I've wanted to create affiliate content, drive content, drive traffic, but just never found a way to build that audience offsite. This is a way to make money in the Amazon ecosystem where you're not driving traffic. This content lives there, and that's how you make money is off of people already shopping.

[00:05:11.800] - Liz
And the way that you get paid through this program is you're going to create content, so those shoppable videos, those video reviews, any product you have in your house that has a listing on Amazon, you don't even have to have bought it on Amazon, right? Anything you've got, if it's got a listing, you can create content for it. And if somebody watches your content on Amazon, engages with it, makes a purchase, you make 1 to 4%, right?

[00:05:39.170] - Liz
So, how is that different than the affiliate program? So, here are some of my posts, some of my favorite ones that I've done. And the difference is, with Associate, of course, you're driving traffic with Influencer, you're on-site. But the other difference monetarily for us is if you are driving traffic, you've got that 24-hour cart cookie, right? So everything in your cart. And then for affiliate, you get only the one item. So for example, my little shade tent over here, which I adore and has made me a lot of money, 12 months and about $5,000 worth of commission just from shoppable content that I wasn't driving traffic to. But when people click on this, they make a purchase. I make commission off of that one item or a related purchase, but only the one item. So I call the related purchase is one-click arm's length distance. So if you click from my little shade tent to a different item that Amazon is recommending, I get commission off of that one-click distance there as well.

[00:06:41.900] - Liz
But let's talk about —we're going to start at the beginning, qualification. We're going to go through how you make money, where the content lives, and then how to pick products. So we're just going to walk through a 101 today of how to make money doing this.

[00:06:57.980] - Liz
So first, let's start with how do you qualify for the Influencer Program? Now, this group is going to be a lot of content creators, so you guys are probably all going to be in really good shape to add this as a stream of revenue pretty quickly. Now, the way you qualify is you have to have an engaged audience on one of these platforms.

[00:07:19.960] - Liz
There's four platforms that they work with. And unfortunately, they don't tell us a ton about the qualifications, but we'll talk about that. The other thing that they're not currently doing is, so if you are an associate and you're driving traffic, while we think that that does good things for you, it's not currently part of the requirement to get approved.

[00:07:43.140] - Liz
So, here are the four platforms that you can use to get into the Amazon Influencer Program. The first two are YouTube and TikTok. These happen to be the hardest and the easiest platforms respectively to get approved with. Youtube happens to currently be the hardest platform to get approved with. TikTok is the easiest platform to get approved with. Now, my theory on why TikTok is the easiest to get approved with is because the TikTok algorithm is designed for engagement, which is really what Amazon is looking for.

[00:08:15.150] - Liz
So, if you are starting from ground zero today and you're like, "Which platform should I pick?" Go to TikTok, create content multiple times a day, post for three, four weeks, and then try to get in. Because we are seeing people that make that happen successfully, consistently right now.

[00:08:34.870] - Liz
Now, the next two platforms that you can get in with are Facebook and Instagram. And I pull these out separately just because there is a little bit of a difference with these. So these are, of course, both owned by Meta. And in order to get into the influencer program with either of these, it has to be a business account. So, it can't be your personal profile with 5,000 friends. It can't be your personal, locked Instagram. It has to be a business account.

[00:09:05.120] - Liz
So, both of these can be changed into business accounts if they're currently personal, right? But in the Facebook side of things, it can be a creator profile, a page, a group. And if you have —so just thinking through some of our OG bloggers, if you used to run challenges and build Facebook groups for challenges, and they're public, it has to be public so that Amazon can see where you're posting stuff. Those are good options for things that maybe are sitting around in your archive that you haven't utilized in a while. Go redevelop that engagement. Get that fired back up and go with that.

[00:09:45.820] - Liz
Now, on the Instagram side, you can make your personal Instagram profile a business account pretty quickly. If you haven't done this, it's a really quick Google search, and it's like a quick switch of your account type in the backend. So if you have a really solid following, but you've just never switched your account, go do that and then go apply. It just is very easy.

[00:10:08.280] - Liz
Now, the thing that I want to tell you specifically about these two platforms, if you decide to apply with an Instagram account that was personal that you changed over to be a public business account, once you get accepted, you cannot change that back to a private personal account. Amazon will at some point sweep through and close your account because of it. Whatever you get approved with has to stay the same way that it was. So just be sure that once you make all of your personal Instagram stuff public and also a business account, it's something you're willing to commit to and there's not content in there that you only wanted to share for a period of time.

[00:10:53.040] - Liz
And then TikTok. So quite honestly, again, ground zero, go start a TikTok channel, talk about anything. Just pick your poison. Whatever you can talk about every day, three times a day, go do that. And the content on Amazon does not have to be niched to what you talk about on your platform that you get approved with. So, for example, and I'm going to switch here and talk a little bit about follower needs here as well. So I got approved with an Instagram account that is a food and health fitness journal, right? Basically, for 90% of it, it's pictures of the food I'm eating that day. I did Whole30 a couple of years ago, got some traction, 2,700 followers, and that's what I got approved with for Amazon Influencer. But when I create content for on-site, I'm not talking about just health and wellness or food items, right? I  review my shoes. I review dog stuff, anything that has —because you're not having to niche down, it can be general content for anything on Amazon.

[00:12:03.420] - Liz
Now, to talk a little bit about how many followers you need, because this is of course what everybody wants to know, and the unfortunate truth is Amazon doesn't tell us. I know you're all shocked that that's not something that they publish. But they basically tell us that you need an engaged audience. And then they say that there is a combination of your follower count and your engagement metrics, and that's really all we know. Now, you will hear people say, "You need 500. You need 1,000." We don't know. We've seen people get approved with TikToks as low as 500 followers, but their engagement is really good. And we've seen people with Facebook groups that have 100, 000 members not get approved. So there just is not a tried and true way to win this system. My best advice is to just go apply, right? If you're like, "Hey, I have this group. Do you think it'll work?" My answer is just go try, because the answer is you'll know when Amazon tells you.

[00:13:05.530] - Liz
Now, there's two parts to the application process, and I'm going to split them out. So right now, we're talking about just getting into the program. You can apply to get into the program as many times as you want. There is not a max out where they say, "You're done with this," which is why I say if you have a group, a platform somewhere, just go try and see if you can get into the program.

[00:13:30.820] - Liz
So there is on-site placement, which I'll talk about in a minute. That's a little bit different because you only get three chances at that. But before we get there, let's talk about where Amazon Influencers are making money, right? So, we make money through on-site placements, and this is going to be your next steps once you get into the program, but this is where the money is. And there's a couple places that have this on-site placement. I have on a slide here in a minute like examples of what each of the placements look like. But the ways that you make money through the program are people watching your video. The different types of content you can do: shoppable videos, shoppable photos, shoppable live streams. Now, any of those pieces of content people can engage with on-site and then make a purchase, and that's how you make commission.

[00:14:24.630] - Liz
Now, the offsite portion of this is you can be repurposing this content. If you have a blog, or an Instagram, or something else and it falls into your niche, you can also be combining this content to double up so that you can be driving that affiliate traffic in addition to taking advantage of that on-site as well.

[00:14:43.870] - Liz
And the third way that we make money is by working with brands for flat fees or additional commissions, depending on where you're finding those brands. Those are the three ways.

[00:14:57.570] - Liz
All right. So you're getting started. What equipment do you need? I like to talk about this because sometimes if people have been doing written content only or just doing photo content and they haven't moved over to video yet, sometimes you just have that hang up of something little in your mind that feels really big, right? And equipment tends to be one of those things. So the good news is you probably don't need anything new, right? You need a camera, and it can be either your computer, so, I'm currently looking at my Mac, right? This is what I use to create all of my on-site content, is either my Mac or my phone. And if you have one of those things, and I say Mac, but it could be a Dell, whatever you have with a camera, you have what you need in way of a camera, right? There are people in the Amazon Influencer Program who do really well with very high-produced content. But then there are people in the program that do really well just using their iPhone, walking around, talking about products. There it is, my little thumbs-up filter. So, whatever you have is going to work for the program, because people are looking for that authentic, trustworthy content.

[00:16:14.010] - Liz
The next thing I recommend is a tripod. If you don't already have one, it does make talking, especially if you're a hand talker like I am, much easier than walking around with your phone. The other thing that I did as I got started or when I can't find my tripod is prop my phone up. So this is not something you have to have, something I recommend.

[00:16:32.440] - Liz
But this is probably my number one recommendation. If you are going to invest in any new equipment, audio is I would say, arguably more important than your video. If you're standing outside filming something and then you go in and do a voiceover that has good video so that you don't hear people in the background, people will stay if they can hear you. Even if the video is like a B-, right? They're not going to stay if your video is an A+ and they cannot hear what you're saying or there's background noise. So if you are like, "Listen, I don't have a good mic." The one thing I recommend, go buy a mic. The ones on the left here, these Lapel mics, are really good. You can find them on Amazon for $20. Just search for Lapel mics for your iPhone or for your Android, whichever. And this little Blue desk microphone, I don't know how much this one is, $20 to $40. You can find them where they give you this good audio for a very low investment amount.

[00:17:36.550] - Liz
All right. So now you got into the program. You've been accepted. Now what? And this is in the Facebook groups or the Reddit threads, these are the number one questions that we get as people get started. It's just like any ecosystem. When you get started, there's new lingo. There's new fill-in the-blank, right? Everything you have to learn, like all the new processes, and terms of service with Amazon and everything else.

[00:18:02.020] - Liz
So, the first thing you're going to do is create three videos. And the reason you do this, is this is the approval process to get that on-site placement. So, up to this point is where if you've had a storefront forever, you are basically here, right? You are starting here. Because you have that storefront, you can create content, usually idea lists and photos that live on that storefront. But this is going to be where you start the process for on-site placement. Now, Amazon gives you this little counter, three of three videos. And once you've uploaded three, you can see I uploaded four because I didn't know when I got started. And then they give you this little lock, as well as the earned on-site commission lock, and they tell you that you are under review. Now, the reason that I don't recommend you upload 10, 20, 30, and just like, "Let's go, I'm ready," is this is the time that Amazon is going to be the most critical of your content. They are going through it with a fine-tooth comb to make sure that everything is terms of service compliant. But what you don't want to do is give them 10, 20, 30 videos to go through, because they don't tell you it's this video that didn't get you approved. They just tell you, "No." So if you have 30 videos, you have no idea if any of them passed or one of them didn't pass, right? So if you have three, it's not a big deal to go pick three more products to create a new video for, right? It's much different.

[00:19:31.200] - Liz
So, this process can take anywhere from, over the summer last year it was three to five days. Last spring, it was six to eight weeks to get approved for on-site placement. So as soon as you get approved and you're in this program, please go do the three videos because there's no telling how long it will take. And that's how you start making money with this program. So you'll see here, and this is when I published mine and when they are either in review or published.

[00:20:01.870] - Liz
But I want to talk for a minute about published versus placement because this creates a lot of confusion as people get started. So currently, you can see that my account is under review in this screenshot, but I have three published videos already. So when your videos are published, they are placed on your storefront, right? So this is published. But until you get that approval for on-site placement, they're not actually showing up anywhere else on Amazon, right?

[00:20:34.000] - Liz
Now, if you are an Associate in driving traffic, that means you can drive traffic to your storefront if you want. Those idea lists like Black Friday sales or whatever the case is, you can still be using your storefront, but Amazon isn't going to then place you on the listing or anywhere else.

[00:20:53.800] - Liz
Let's talk a little bit about a couple of the places that you can have your content show up. Placement, as a disclaimer, is 100% up to Amazon. So, when I create content, this is just a general timeline, I will upload that video and within 24 hours Amazon publishes it to my storefront. It usually takes 24 to 72 hours then for it to get on-site placement and start showing up on product listings or other locations.

[00:21:25.660] - Liz
I wanted to show you the top three locations that we look at as being the most profitable. And then just know, I'll give you a couple other descriptions of other places, but Amazon is constantly testing where to put influencer content. And so a lot of times people will be like, "I'm making a ton of money off of this one video. It's not on a product listing, and I don't know where it's making money." Just know that you won the Amazon Lotto, and they are testing it somewhere in the ecosystem that we don't have visibility into because they don't tell us.

[00:21:59.190] - Liz
So the number one placement for Amazon Influencer content is this upper carousel on the product listing. And here in a minute, I'll walk through the anatomy of the product listing, but just know for right now, this is the upper carousel on the product listing page on desktop. My videos that are in these carousels do eight to 10 times better than my videos that are not. So it is the number one thing, that number one placement. If you can land a spot in the top carousel, you're doing good. Now, as you scroll down, the upper carousel is only really on desktop. There are occasions that it shows up on mobile, but for the purposes of today, this is a desktop-only type of placement.

[00:22:44.800] - Liz
Videos for this product, this is going to be down below product information, both on mobile, usually, and on desktop. So this is going to be your most consistent placement. And you still do well with these. It's just not quite as well as this upper carousel.

[00:23:03.520] - Liz
And then the third placement that we see results from is what's called the Inspire feed. So if you haven't seen this yet, if you go to your Amazon shopping app on your phone, you see this little star guy down here on this phone app, that's the Inspire feed. And it's basically a shoppable stream, right? And there's a lot of photos. They ask for vertical shorts. If you think about this as Amazon's way trying to compete with Instagram and TikTok shop, they want fast, clever content, top 10 things that Amazon, I found for my car, whatever the case is, right? That's the type of content we see here.

[00:23:47.070] - Liz
There is one other stream that we see, which is the Discover feed. It's a little bit more in-depth to find, and I'm happy to walk anybody through it. But it's specifically for fashion and beauty products. So, Inspire tends to be dog products, all the things. Discover is specifically fashion and beauty, so that's just another place.

[00:24:09.080] - Liz
We also show up in search results. We show up sometimes if a brand doesn't have a video as the main video. Honestly, we just see Amazon put us in all sorts of places that are wild. And anytime Amazon places you somewhere, it's a really good opportunity for you to take advantage of onsite traffic for commission. It's really a lot of fun to follow along day to day.

[00:24:34.310] - Liz
Let's take a minute and just take a step back and talk about what Amazon's stated purpose is for the Amazon Influencer Program. And this is something that I like for people to keep in mind. Because people get lost in the nuance of like, "What should I talk about? Why is this here?"

[00:24:53.180] - Liz
Amazon stated purpose for the program is to help shoppers make more confident buying decisions. And so they are always looking for content that fulfills that, but also that helps them make more sales. If we are on a product listing page, it's because we're helping convert that traffic. Otherwise, we would not have been there for two years. So we are helping Amazon make more money. We're making more money. We're helping the seller make more money, and we're helping buyers make more confident buying decisions. It's like the ultimate win, as far as I'm concerned, in the Amazon ecosystem.

[00:25:30.660] - Liz
So, what kind of content can you make for shoppable photos, videos, live streams? You can do video reviews. And this is probably predominantly what people think of when they think about Amazon Influencer content is video reviews for products. Again, this is anything you've got in your house that has an Amazon listing already.

[00:25:55.320] - Liz
But what are some other types of content you can create? Because Amazon tells you that you can create, and they want you to create multiple pieces of content for the same product. So if you have a yoga mat, or I'm going to use a bookshelf for this scenario just because it makes more sense, unboxing yoga mats is not always super exciting, right? It's like, "Here's the mat." But what other kinds of content can you create? If you've got a bookshelf, like unboxing it and show how it comes and how big the box is and how many pieces are in it, doing a video of you putting it together and talking about how long it took. How good were the instructions? Did you have to watch the video on YouTube? Did you need help from the manufacturer? Those are the types of things that are really valuable to shoppers when they're considering a purchase.

[00:26:43.720] - Liz
Answering questions about the product. You can do this by looking at the Q&A down at the bottom of the product listing or thinking about what you were wondering when you were about to buy that. I have an under-the-desk treadmill, and people always want to know, "Oh, how fast can you walk on it at your desk? Do you have to have a special desk to do it?" All those sorts of things. If you can answer that for people, that's going to be valuable to them.

[00:27:12.480] - Liz
I'll tell you, my best-performing videos are three to five minutes long, so not short. Ana d they are usually for products that are in that $100 to $200 product range where people are giving it that extra thought, like they want to pick the best option for their space, for their house. My top two videos are my under-the-desk treadmill and my 10x10 shade pen for my backyard because I show people how I put it up and down by myself when I'm five foot four and not a six-foot tall person. I have to do it a little bit differently. But I've created this basically like tutorial so people can do it. I do really well on that video because it helps people make that buying decision.

[00:27:58.310] - Liz
Best use for the product, personal or practical examples. The best advice I've heard people give is think about if you and I are just sitting down and you're just telling me about this product. "Oh, my gosh, this new set of knives. I love this block. Look at how cute these handles are." Any of those things is really valuable to people.

[00:28:22.120] - Liz
All right. So you're in, you're getting on-site, you've worked through everything in your house, and you're starting to buy new things. And you think, I want to make sure that I am using my time wisely and that every time I buy something that's coming into my house that I am set up to make the most money that I can from this product.

[00:28:44.590] - Liz
So, I want to show you three things on a product listing that you want to be looking for to maximize your income when you're doing on-site content creations. So this is basically like pick your product listing, right? I have Big B, Little B, Marker Parker here. The very first thing you're going to look for is this upper carousel. So you see how it says six videos? It's got this. It says, "Click to see more videos." That's the number one thing that you want to be on the lookout for. And then that's because not everyone does, so you want to stay away from these. And then you want to look for how many videos there are, so fewer videos is better. And then you want to look at a 4.4 or higher because mathematically those listings do better. It's better for you as an influencer. Those are the three things you're going to look at when you are doing product research.

[00:29:45.660] - Liz
I think that gets us all the way through. I think the only thing I have left here is if you are ready to get started or you just have more questions about the Influencer Program, I put together a landing page for us. It's just FluencerFruitConnect.com/Breakthrough. Head over there. And I do have coaching. I have a course. The course is intended to take you if you are just getting started through monetization. It helps you so you don't have to go read all the terms of service. It's like I hold your hand and we walk through that process so that you have that help. And then I also have, if you are already an Amazon Influencer, an extension that helps with product research as well as video placement management. And as part of the "Breakthrough Summit Bundle", I do have a coupon, which will be on that page as well that gives you a free three months to the extension. So, Liz, thank you for having me. And if you guys have any questions, feel free to reach out.

[00:30:52.740] - Liz, Host
Yes, thank you. I learned so much. I'm like, "This is a whole new world now." So, yeah, if you haven't gotten the "Speaker Bonus Bundle" definitely do that because you will get three months. And everyone else, definitely go check this out. And hopefully you're as excited to learn more about this as I am. Thank you, Liz.

[00:31:09.880] - Liz
You're welcome. Thanks for having me.
