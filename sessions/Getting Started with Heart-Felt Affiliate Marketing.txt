Hi there, my name's Leanne, and I am here today to teach you about affiliate marketing and I'm going to be teaching you today about ethical affiliate marketing. So, how to be strategic and get results, but without being sleazy.

[00:00:25.770] - Leanne
So, a little bit about me, so my name's Leanne and I based in Cardiff in the U.K. and I ran two successful websites. So, I started out as a travel blogger, which is where I started learning my affiliate marketing strategies. I'm going be teaching each day. And now I also have a website called Passive Income Superstars, where I also host the course affiliate Marketing Super star. So if you're interested in learning more about affiliate marketing, then stay with me, because at the end of this presentation, I will offer you a discount code for that as well.

[00:01:00.750] - Leanne
So, I'm all about passive income. I'm not a big fan of sort of sending endless cold pitches to brands. I don't like working to other people's deadlines. And so affiliate marketing really suits me. And and that's why I love it so much. I'm going to tell you a little bit more about that in a moment. In my spare time when I'm not working on my website. Then you'll usually find me traveling somewhere. I really enjoy photography, do a bit of swimming and dancing as well. Although to be fair, most of those hobbies have been on hold for a little while to covid and a little random fact about me.

[00:01:33.780] - Leanne
So, I was once slapped in the face by a wild eagle. And if you want to know more about that story, then you'll have to ask me over in the Facebook group.

[00:01:42.030] - Leanne
So, let's talk about affiliate marketing. So, affiliate marketing. We're going to start with the absolute basics, because it might be that some of you that are watching this have never tried it before. So, what is affiliate marketing. But essentially it is a type of word of mouth marketing. So, that means that you try a product and if you have a good experience with it, then you recommend it to your audience. And if they go on to make a purchase, then you earn a small commission or a referral fee for offering that person. Now you will only get paid if that person goes on to make a sale. And therefore, because of that, it's a very low cost, risk free type of marketing for brands and businesses.

[00:02:25.240] - Leanne
So, why is it marketing so great? Well, firstly, it's a form of passive income, so that means that all the work that you're doing now can continue to earn money for the next weeks, months or even years. And so for that reason, when people talk about making money in their sleep, that's true. It doesn't mean that they're not working for it. They're doing the work, but they're continuing to see results long term. And that's one of the great things about affiliate marketing, because it means that your business will continue to grow and that business can grow exponentially.

[00:02:56.260] - Leanne
There's no ceiling with affiliate marketing. So, if you were relying on work with brands in order to make an income, then there is some limitations. So, for example, even though you can raise your fees, there is a limit as to how much you can charge. And also there's a limit as to how much work you can take on. Whereas with affiliate marketing you just take on as much as you want. But like I said, because all of those articles that you've already written or already circulating, your business can grow and grow and grow and there is no ceiling for how far that can go.

[00:03:29.260] - Leanne
Also, the fact that you can be 100% authentic and retain your audiences trust is super important. So, one of the things that I felt uncomfortable about working with brands was that you made an agreement before you'd experienced a product, and if you didn't really enjoy using that product, you feel obliged to say positive things about it because you've got a financial arrangement between you and that brand. And that just didn't sit right with me. I wanted to always be honest about my experiences. And so affiliate marketing was a great way to do that because I'm only promoting products that I already have experience with.

[00:04:04.000] - Leanne
Also, I mention I'm not very good at deadlines. I like to I like to work to my own timetable. And for that reason, I think marketing is brilliant. It means that if a friend wants to go for coffee, you can just put down work and go out without worrying about hitting the deadlines. You can just come back to the article the next day.

[00:04:23.530] - Leanne
And so it's great for that work/life balance, which I think a lot of people go into blogging in order to find.

[00:04:31.960] - Leanne
Also, it doesn't require huge page numbers. So lots of people think that you need to have huge page numbers in order to be successful with affiliate marketing. That's just not true. It does certainly help, however, is much more important that you get the right people to see your articles rather than just lots of them. We'll talk about that in a moment.

[00:04:55.270] - Leanne
So, occasionally affiliate marketing does get a bit of a bad reputation, and the reason for that is that there are some affiliate marketers out there who will say anything to land a sale and who might promote products based on the commission rates rather than based on their true experiences. A classic example is there's a particular hosting company that is sort of well known amongst bloggers as being not the best. Sometimes that leads to slow websites, but they have a very, very good commission structure for affiliates. And as a result, there are lots of people who promote it to new bloggers. And as a result, there are lots of people are very disappointed when they realize that their website is slow because of their host and they have to change later on. So, that's what I want to avoid. And I think we do have to accept there will always be bad eggs in every single business. However, it's our responsibility to show that affiliate marketing can be ethical and it can be positive and it can be good for all three parties involved. So, for example, a brand will get low cost risk free marketing. You can build a passive income business and your followers and your readers will find out about products that they perhaps didn't know existed, that hopefully going to go on to make improvements in their quality of life.

[00:06:14.870] - Leanne
So, how does affiliate marketing work? So basically, you start off by building an audience now that audience doesn't have to be a blog readership. It could also be an email list. It could be a social media channel. As long as you have an audience that you can reach and influence than you can and join up to affiliate programs. So, you then join an affiliate program or network and you're given a link that's unique to you with a tracking idea on the end of it. You could then use this link in your blog post or email, your social media posts and and even then you Pinterest pins. And then if somebody clicks on that link, even if they click on it, say a couple, they click on it, but don't buy for a couple of weeks.

[00:06:59.390] - Leanne
They are tracked by something called cookies. And as long as they are, they buy the product within the cookie period, then you will be rewarded. A commission as a thank you for offering that sale.

[00:07:15.210] - Leanne
So, today, I really wanted to focus in on what I'm calling today a heart centered approach to affiliate marketing. What I mean is an ethical feel good approach, and that really does start with understanding who you can help and how you can go about helping them.

[00:07:34.350] - Leanne
So, I always start by creating an ideal reader in my mind. So this ideal reader or some people call them avatars, is somebody that you need to be thinking of every single time that you write an article and every single time that you write an email or even a social media post. And sometimes it's useful to actually give them a name as well, because if they've got a name, they feel a little bit more real and that will help you with your writing.

[00:08:00.870] - Leanne
So, before you decide what you're going to promote, you want to ask yourself lots of different questions about this ideal reader. And so ask yourself, how old are they? Where do they live? Do they have children? Are they married or single? What do they enjoy? What do they not enjoy? Do they have any pet peeves? Is there anything that really annoys them? What worries them? What their plans or their goals for the future? And what problems do they have at the moment that they need solving? And also with those goals, are there any roadblocks stopping them from achieving them? So, if you ask yourself all of these questions, you can then go on to ask yourself if there's any products that you've used to solve similar problems that you can recommend to them to help them with their roadblocks as well.

[00:08:44.580] - Leanne
So, affiliate marketing is essentially all about problem solving, and that's one of the things that I think a lot of people don't realize. So, usually what happens is bloggers will write an article and then they will look back through and see if they can add any affiliate links. However, they find then that they don't convert very well, and that's because they haven't started with the problem. So, you have to start with the problem before you even write the article. You need to start with thinking about how you can go about solving it and how you can reach that person when they're ready to make a purchase. And if you do that, you will start to see improvements in your conversions with your affiliate links.

[00:09:27.730] - Leanne
So, what we're going to do is going to have a look at a couple of fictional characters or avatars. And then I'm going to show you how you can help them with affiliate products.

[00:09:35.860] - Leanne
So, we're going to start with Clare. Clare is married, she is 32 and she's got a three month old baby. And prior to having a baby, she was enjoying keeping fit and meeting her friends for coffee. But currently she's just absolutely exhausted. Babies not sleeping, she's not sleeping. And as a result, she's just too tired to enjoy the things that she normally does. And she's worried that she's missing out on her baby growing up because she's too tired to enjoy it. So, products that could potentially help clear out products that will help her baby sleep better and therefore help her through the first few months of being a mom. So, something like perhaps a baby yoga class or sleep training course.

[00:10:14.280] - Leanne
The next person I want you to meet is Anna. So, Anna is single, she's twenty. She's on the career ladder and she's currently working from home due to covered. And prior to covid she was pretty fit and healthy. She enjoyed some contact sports, such as playing netball. She enjoyed eating out. She usually pretty health conscious when she goes out, chooses the healthy things off the menu. However, currently she can't play sports and due to social distancing, she's working longer hours as a result of a lot of her colleagues being sick and as a result, she doesn't have time to cook. And so she's finding that she's ordering more takeaways. And as a result, she noticed that her health is suffering. So, the sorts of products that could potentially help Anna might be products that help her exercise at home, the home fitness equipment or home fitness programs. It could be products that help her to eat healthier and more healthily. So, it might be healthy food delivery services or it could be a course or an eBook that helps her to make healthy meals quickly.

[00:11:18.950] - Leanne
So, before we can work out how to help avatars Anna and Claire with their problems, we need to understand the brain funnel or the sales funnel. So, the idea is that people move from unaware to product aware for various stages. And this process can happen very quickly over, say, 30 minutes or an hour if it's a low cost product or it can take a lot longer. So, when somebody becomes aware of a problem, they don't know how to resolve it. Their problem aware. And then they become aware of various solutions, but they haven't decided on a specific solution at that point they are solution aware and then they go on to become product aware and they have to then decide whether that product is right for them. And so they do research on that specific product.

[00:12:12.710] - Leanne
So, the closer somebody is to the end of that buying funnel, the easier it will be to get to see conversions. So, if you were reaching somebody when they're only just problem aware that probably not ready to make a purchase and therefore you might not see the conversions to try to reach people when they are solution and product elsewhere. Also, if you are promoting higher ticket products that may cost hundreds or thousands of dollars, it's going to take somebody a lot longer to work through that funnel. So, again, you really need to be focusing on reaching people towards the end of that funnel.

[00:12:50.960] - Leanne
However, if it's a low cost product, then you may have more success reaching people at the start of the funnel because it doesn't take quite as long to to work through that process.

[00:13:03.620] - Leanne
So, if we go back and look at Clare's journey, so Clare is our new mum and she's been feeling exhausted, but she's just presuming that it's normal for new mums. So, she then reads a blog article called "What to Expect in your first Six Months as a New Mum". And she realizes during the article that though it's pretty normal to feel tired, perhaps her baby could be sleeping better than she is. And so as a result, she wants to try and improve her baby's sleep. So she's now problem aware. So, she goes on to read an article called "10 Ways to Improve Your Baby Sleep Pattern". And at that point, she starts to think about courses or products that could help her baby sleep better. And now she might be searching for something like the best sleep training courses for new babies. And then she becomes aware of a couple of different courses and she now has to decide which is the right one for her. So she's product aware and she might start to search for things like, say, course A or B.

[00:14:05.700] - Leanne
Now, if we look at Anna's journey, so Anna is currently on lockdown and feels that her health is suffering. So, she starts off by reading an article called "10 Ways to Get Healthier to beat Covid".  And she realizes that she really should be trying to pack some more nutrients into her diet. She's not quite sure how because she's really busy. She's working all hours. She doesn't have time to be cooking elaborate meals. So she reads an article called "10 Benefits of Daily Fruit Smoothies". And she thinks actually that's a really good idea, that she can cram a lot of nutrients into her breakfast. And it's something that can be created pretty quickly. So, it seems like a good solution to her. So, she now starts to search for articles like "How to Make Fruit Smoothies". And in the article, a blender, a particular blender is mentioned. So, she now has to decide whether that blender is the one that's worth spending the money on. And so she might be searching for things like a particular blender. You.

[00:15:03.100] - Leanne
So there's lots of different articles that you can write to convert affiliate sales, but again, keep in mind that you want to be reaching people when they either solution or product aware. So, for example, a product to review or comparison a product tutorial, if it's like a digital product, you can do like a video walk through of a product or interviews with a product owner. They are all going to reach people when they're already product aware.

[00:15:30.970] - Leanne
A point on the interviews is that it's difficult to get traffic to these sorts of articles so people don't tend to be searching for an interview. However, they can support other articles. And also, if you've got a big social media following or you've got a very engaged email list, then something like a an interview with a product owner or somebody that's affiliated with that product, like a marketing manager or somebody like that, can actually be really useful. Because what you're doing is helping your reader come to know, like and trust the the product owner as well as yourself. And therefore, they are more likely to make a purchase from a product where they know a little bit more about the background and who created it.

[00:16:14.470] - Leanne
I've also mentioned here product listicle. So that's the sort of top 10 style articles or how to guides as well, where you use an affiliate product as part of the solution. Also gift guides or special offer round ups and parking lists if you're in the travel niche. So, these are more for people who are solution aware and reaching people just slightly higher up in that buying funnel. But you could still converse in sales and often these sorts of articles might actually have high search volumes of Googles. You might get more traffic or the conversion rates will be slightly lower than those articles, like a product review or product comparison.

[00:16:56.100] - Leanne
So, when you are thinking about the keywords to target, keep in mind that buying funnel and think about what sort of terminology you would use if you were looking for a product to solve a specific problem and and then use that to do some keyword research. And the important thing with Keyword research is it's not about the page search volume. So, for example, if there's a search volume for keyword of, say, 100, but it's a keyword that shows high buying intent, I would always target that one rather than a keyword that perhaps has a thousand search volume. However, it doesn't show much. Buying is reaching people much higher up in that buying funnel when they're not ready to make a purchase. So, just make sure that you keep that in mind and keep an open mind, even when a keyword doesn't look like it has a lot of people searching for it.

[00:17:51.060] - Leanne
So, for example, one of my keywords gets while the the article gets in 75 times a month, which isn't a lot. However, that particular article over about 18 months made two and a half thousand dollars. So if I had excluded that because the search volume was so low, I think the search volume was actually lower than that because the same ranking for a few different keywords, search volume was only about 10 or 15. But I'm ranking number one for that. So, I picked up a few low volume keywords. And those 75 people that landed my article are very, very likely to go ahead and make a purchase. So it's really important that your readers come to know, like and trust you.

[00:18:36.210] - Leanne
So, you need to stay authentic, only promote products that you genuinely believe in. But also if you get the opportunity to convert a reader into a subscriber or somebody to follow you on social media, then you've got an opportunity to nurture your relationship. And then you can come back to promoting these affiliate products later on down the line when they've had time to get to know you.

[00:18:58.080] - Leanne
However, when you are writing a blog article and somebody is perhaps reaching you towards the end of that funnel, they're going to make a purchase quite quickly and they don't have time to get to know you. So, there are certain things that you can do within a blog article that do help to build that. No, like a trust factor. So, for example, be really open about your level of experience with the product. So, if you've got experience, talk about your personal feelings about it.

[00:19:25.800] - Leanne
And if you don't have experience, if perhaps you've done a sort of critical review of a variety of products talk about your methods and talk about why you're qualified to review those products.

[00:19:37.680] - Leanne
Explain why you think a product is valuable. Don't just tell people something's amazing that you should definitely buy it. You've got to give somebody a reason. So, talk about why that product stands out compared to other products. Is there anything in particular that made you choose over something else? And what are the pros and cons of that product? So, be very, very specific.

[00:20:02.370] - Leanne
And don't be afraid to say negative things. Sometimes I think it looks really suspicious if you read a blog article where everything is positive and every single product they mention is amazing. That sounds to me a little bit sales. Whereas if you are very open and say, well, this product I really liked for this reason. However, there is a slight problem and you talk about one of the negative aspects, but you can perhaps even turn that into a positive by talking about how you can work around that issue or perhaps that issue actually doesn't really matter that much. And you could talk about that, or you could give another alternative where the alternative solves the problem from the from the previous product.

[00:20:43.710] - Leanne
Also, when you are writing these articles, don't get too formal. Instead, keep it very conversational. So, talk to them like they're your friend. And and also think about affiliate marketing like you would promoting a product to somebody that you know. So, if you wouldn't feel comfortable promoting a product to your best friend, then you shouldn't be writing an article about it either. So, just always keep that in mind and ask yourself, you know, how would I promote this to my friend and would I promote this to my friend?

[00:21:13.890] - Leanne
And then finally, if there is a way to get somebody onto your email list or to follow you on social media, then do try to do that, because they might not be ready to buy now, but they might be later on after you've had chance to nurture that relationship. So, perhaps offering a freebie like a like a cheat sheet that they can download or something that's relevant to the finished product or to the problem that if that product sells, will hopefully get them onto your email list and then you can come back to promoting the product a bit later on down the line.

[00:21:45.970] - Leanne
So, there's lots of different affiliate networks to join, so for example, Awin, Shareasale, Commission Junction or some of the biggest, and when you join a network, you're essentially paid directly from the network rather than individual programs, but you still have to join individual programs. So, it just basically keeps everything nice and organized so that you can see at a glance which programs are working, which aren't.

[00:22:09.820] - Leanne
Amazon Associates is a really popular program. There are so many different products that almost any nation can benefit from Amazon. And the only problem with it really is that there are low commission rates and there's also lots of rules to follow, as well as the possibility of of getting thrown out if you if you accidentally break one of the rules. However, that said, Amazon are really good at selling. So, you can refer somebody for ten dollar product. But chances are that Amazon will offer them lots of related products before they reach the checkout. And so often, even though you're referring to somebody for ten dollar product, they might pick up some of the things that they need at the same time. And then you get rewarded for the full value, which might be five or 10 times the amount that you offer them for.

[00:22:59.980] - Leanne
Essy is a great program and it's got a 30 day cookie period. And it's really good for almost every niche, but for things like gift guides.

[00:23:09.250] - Leanne
Skimlinks is a good network for beginners. So, Skimlinks, you join the network, you don't have to join individual programs. Instead, it will scan your website and find lots of different links and convert them to affiliate links for you, which is great for say, for example, you only mentioned a product once or twice, so it's not worth joining the program, but you might possibly pick up at the occasional sale here and there. So, it's great for sort of mopping up those sales. It's also really good for if you are slightly new, a blogger and perhaps you get rejected from an affiliate program and so you can via Skimlinks and you can start earning money with them straight away.

[00:23:50.020] - Leanne
The final one I wanted to mention is Ultimate Bundles. So, Ultimate Bundles is slightly different. So they sell bundles of digital products; so courses, eBooks, templates, memberships, things like that. And they've got these bundles for a huge range of niches. So, there are bundles for healthy eating, gardening, photography, home schooling, loads of different things. You may already be familiar with the Genius Bloggers Toolkit, which is one of those bundles, and that one specifically for bloggers.

[00:24:21.220] - Leanne
Now, these sales are open, close cart sales, which means that they're only available for a very short period of time. However, they tend to be very heavily discounted. So they tend to be a little bit easier to promote because they've got that sort of little element of urgency that sort of makes people make decisions. I think a lot of us are bad decision makers. I know I certainly am and often just need that little prod in order to make me decide whether or not I want something. So that's where Ultimate Bundles comes in and it's got quite high commission rate as well. So, you can earning anywhere between 40 and 70 percent commissions, which are huge. So, definitely check out Ultimate Bundles.

[00:25:07.610] - Leanne
So, there's lots of different places you can use your affiliate links, doesn't just have to be in your blog post, so within your blog posts you can use and deep links, you can use buttons. I like to use a bright colored button for really clear call to action. Like click here to check up to date prices. You can even turn images into affiliate links. You can use tables. Tables are a Great Decision-Making tool which will increase conversion rates. So definitely consider using some there and you can also consider using widgets as well. Although I personally don't like widgets, I find that less people click on widgets, I think probably because they look a little bit like ads. And so as a result, people will often just skim over them.

[00:25:47.000] - Leanne
And there are other places on your blog. So for example, your home page or category, page or about me page, which is probably one of your most visited pages on your website, obviously your resources page and also in your sidebar as well.

[00:26:02.090] - Leanne
On Facebook, you can promote links and on your page or within your group or potentially other groups if it's allowed. You always need to check the rules. And often Facebook group owners so that you link to an article rather than a direct link. And also, potentially you can use paid ads on Facebook as well.

[00:26:22.760] - Leanne
On Instagram, you've got the link in your bio and you can use a smart bio link or something like that. You can use to swipe up feature if you've got over ten thousand followers and you can talk about your everyday products and your storage captions and your reals.

[00:26:37.760] - Leanne
On Pinterest you've got a few different options. You can use an affiliate link and link directly to a product. So, they don't actually go anywhere near your website. You do need to mark that as an affiliate link. And you also need to check the terms and conditions of the program to make sure that they allow that. You can also link to your articles that are affiliate articles and you can also link to any pages you've got for promoting your lead magnet's to get somebody onto your email list and then you can set up an email funnel that goes out to them over a period of time promoting products.

[00:27:13.460] - Leanne
YouTube videos and Podcast. You need to use a link shortener, so that your links are nice and easy to remember that when you're talking about them, somebody can remember how to find that link. And you can also link to your affiliate links in your show notes or in your descriptions.

[00:27:28.750] - Leanne
And finally on Twitter, if you decide to use it, links there, make sure that you do tag the company. So, I've done that before where a company has then shared my affiliate link and I've gone ahead and had quite a lot of money because all of the people that they are sharing it to, their entire audience, already interested in the product and therefore conversion rates will be quite high.

[00:27:55.110] - Leanne
Let's talk about the legalities, because this is something that often confuses people and puts people off starting affiliate marketing. So, there's just a few important things to remember. So, firstly, your feelings need to be marked as sponsored links. It used to be that they just had to be no-follow. But now Google does prefer them to be marked as sponsored. You need to make sure that you are disclosing everything as an affiliate link. So, on a blog post the FTC likes to see a disclosure of both your video link and also they don't want it to be too far away. So if you've got a really long article, then it might not be enough to have a disclosure just at the top of your post. You might want to add one at the bottom or there is a tool that I use first affiliate, which adds automatic disclosure so that all of my clients have a tiny little I just above the link. And when you hover over the link to click on it, there is a little notification thumbs up saying it is an affiliate link. Not everybody uses that, but it does mean that you are completely covered.

[00:28:56.460] - Leanne
There is also a plug in that I use called the FNTC plugin, which is basically an easy way to add an automatic disclosure above your articles. So, it puts the disclosure above your social share buttons. And that way the information about your affiliate links doesn't get included in the first 100 words of your article, which can sometimes impact on your SEO. So, it's much better to have it above those social share and not included in that.

[00:29:25.770] - Leanne
You'll also want to have a slightly more detailed disclosure on a legal page where you talk about cookies, and about how you will earn a commission if somebody goes ahead and purchases a product.

[00:29:43.350] - Leanne
So, link cloaking is something that not everybody does, but I highly recommend doing it. So, basically link cloaking means that you take your normal affiliate link, which is usually a really sort of ugly string of numbers that you're never going to remember. And you can turn it into a branded link that is short, neat and easy to remember, so that if somebody asks you for your affiliate link, perhaps you're in a Facebook group and you recommended a product and somebody asks you if you have a link for it, then you can give them the link straightaway. It also means that if the company changes their products well and changes their site structure so that the link changes slightly, you don't have to go back through your whole website looking for all the links to correct them. All you need to do is change it once within your library and it changes instantly across your whole site. So, that's going to save you an awful lot of time. And also it makes it easier for finding affiliate links as well, because you can access your library of affiliate links within your WordPress dashboard while still creating an article.

So, the link cloaking tool. I use is called Thirsty-Affiliates Affiliates. There are other ones out there, like Pretty Links. But First Year is the one I use and I've always enjoyed using it, I recommend it. So, to give you an example of what a cloak link looks like, this is my link for Thirsty-Affiliates. So, as you can see, it's the name of my website, SEO. Passive income superstars.com/recommends/ Thirsty-Affiliates.

[00:31:13.800] - Leanne
So, all of my affiliate links will then follow the same structure. So, all of them have the name of my website, followed by recommends, followed by the name of the product.

[00:31:27.630] - Leanne
I want to talk a little bit about affiliate emails, because I think this is one of the things that a lot of bloggers find really difficult. When I asked my Facebook group about what their biggest struggles with email marketing were, lots of them told me they didn't know how to monetize their email list and they didn't feel comfortable using affiliate links within their emails. And I think that that's partly because when you were building an email list, it's difficult enough to get somebody to join your list and then to open your emails. The last thing you want is for them to unsubscribe. And so I think this makes people very nervous about using affiliate links and the emails, but it's actually a really effective way of doing affiliate marketing. But you just need to follow a few rules in order to make sure that you're doing it in the right way.

[00:32:13.680] - Leanne
So, firstly, I like to follow the 80-20 rule. So what I mean by this is that 80% of what I send to my email list is all about value and only 20% is about sales. So, it might be that more of my emails are just about promoting tips, but it could also be that a specific affiliate email still carries a lot of tips in it. And then an affiliate product, as mentioned towards the end of the email. That's another way of doing it. But basically, just make sure that you're not making your whole email list and email marketing strategy about sales, but that you are adding value to somebody.

[00:32:51.960] - Leanne
Also segment your list. So what I mean by that is to create either groups or segments, depending on which email platform you use to show what somebody is interested in. So, what you can do is add attacked them every time they join via a certain lead Magner or every time they interact with one of your emails, you can add a tag that adds them to a segment which just helps you understand your email subscribers a little bit better. So, for example, I have segments for beginner bloggers and advance bloggers and I don't send the same recommendations to each.

[00:33:29.370] - Leanne
And this just means that, say, for example, if I had a segment on my email list of bloggers interested in Pinterest and then perhaps Tailwind, we're running a special offer. I could message just my followers that I know are interested in Tailwind and not annoy the rest who perhaps don't want to use a tool like that. And that's fine. I also like to offer an opportunity to opt out promotional email.

[00:33:56.500] - Leanne
So, every now and then I will do a promotion over a period of time when a product is only available for a short period of time or a company is having a sale or something along those lines. I'll want to send more than one email that week about it. So, what I do is on every single email that I send, I include a sentence at the end that says, "If you're not interested in this product or if you've already purchased it and you don't want to receive any more emails about it, that's fine. Just click here and let me know and I won't send it to you again." And what that does is it stops people from unsubscribing from your email list because they have another way of opting out of those emails that they're just not interested in.

[00:34:33.270] - Leanne
Also, when you do write your emails and and you're promoting an affiliate product, try to make it more than just a promotion, try to make it something that somebody is going to want to read. So, tell stories, find ways to connect with your audience, be vulnerable, tell them about your struggles, give them tips, give them some educational information, tell them funny stories that you know, you can make a promotional email still really valuable.

[00:35:02.280] - Leanne
So, a few more affiliate marketing tips, so number one, is focused on the benefits. So, what I mean by benefits is the features of a product. You need to talk about how those features translate into real life in terms of how they are going to improve somebody's quality of life. Is it going to save them time? Is it going to save them money, you know talk about what life looks like with more time or more money or whatever it is that they are benefiting from. So, sort of give this sort of before and after picture, and that's quite powerful.

[00:35:35.760] - Leanne
Also, make sure that you use multiple links on your blog articles. Don't just rely on putting one link at the end of your article. Not everyone will get to the end. And you don't want to have to make people go searching for your links. It is about striking a balance. You don't want to use so many links on your blog post that it looks really spammy. So you need to strike that balance. But I like to have one at the beginning, one at the end, one in the middle, and then occasionally I'll use a few more here and there if I've got some buttons some comparison tables or something along those lines.

[00:36:08.040] - Leanne
When you first get started, I recommend focusing just on one or two products and get really good at promoting those products, create lots of different articles that reach people at different points in the funnel and just learn how to promote one and then use that same technique for promoting your other products. And if you really sort of focus in on one or two products, you will start to find results happen much faster than if you're spreading yourself too thin.

[00:36:36.750] - Leanne
If you're a more advanced blogger and you're wondering where to go now with your affiliate strategy, then definitely think about creating a email funnels, which you can automate. So, when somebody joins your email list, they get a series of emails, firstly, to warn them up and introduce them to yourself, give them lots of tips, and then gradually expose them to your affiliate products and talk to them about the benefits. You can try promoting an open close cart sale.

[00:37:02.460] - Leanne
So, I mentioned before about Ultimate Bundles. That's just one affiliate program that you can join as one of my favorites. But there are lots of programs out there like that. You could consider putting some ad spend behind your articles, but only do that if the article is converting really well. So, you need to understand how much money you make on average for every person that lands on your blog post. Without knowing that information, it's very difficult to know whether you will benefit from putting any ad spend behind it. Also, you might want to look at your strategy and make some tweaks. So, for example, you can use heat maps where you get a visual depiction of how people are interacting with your post and you can see where they're clicking and what sort of links they're clicking more on. And then you can make some tweaks to your articles. And one of the ways that you do that is by joining Affiliamate. That gives you a lot of information about which of your articles performing well and which are underperforming.
