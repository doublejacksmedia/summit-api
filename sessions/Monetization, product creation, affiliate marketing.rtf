**Transcript:**\
[00:00:12.010] - Liz\
All right, guys. I'm so excited to have Aisha Preece back because her sessions are always just fantastic. I always walk away with things I need to do. I know we tend to, you know, she tends to teach these things meant for newer bloggers, but even established bloggers can get quite a lot from her. So, Aisha, thank you so much for coming back. I really appreciate it.\
\
[00:00:32.410] - Aisha\
Thank you so much for having me. And I really enjoyed last year, and everybody who attended was amazing, so I had to come back. So, thank you everybody who's watching this. I appreciate you, Liz, and I appreciate everybody attending.\
\
[00:00:42.800] - Liz\
Yes. And I know last year we kind of talked about SEO, but this year we're going to talk about affiliate marketing because you've really expanded that. So, why don't you share a little bit of your background of affiliate marketing before we dive into the teaching, just so people know where you're coming from.\
\
[00:00:56.210] - Aisha\
Right. So, I currently have six sites. Two of my sites are more established, so the first site hits $18,000 a month for one site. But then I also set up new sites. And I realize the struggle with newer websites are, we think I'm new, I don't have any traffic, can I make money from affiliates? And what I've done is I've implemented strategies to ensure that even these baby sites, even if you set it up three, four months ago, I want to make sure that you guys can learn how to earn, because that's certainly something I'm doing for my newer sites. Everyone, if you have a lot of traffic, it's easy. But what about newbies, right? Or newbies that have new sites struggling to earn their first $100. So, I want to make sure I can support all of you.\
\
[00:01:38.590] - Liz\
Okay. So, first of all, because it is turning six sites, it's a lot, but let's go ahead. Let's kind of talk about affiliate marketing is where you refer someone to a product, and you earn a commission, you know, if a sale is made. But when you have less page views, it means you have less opportunities for conversion. So, how do you get a conversion when you don't have that many opportunities to?\
\
[00:02:04.700] - Aisha\
Right. So, first things first, you need to think about the type of affiliate program you're going for. Right? And so, the mistake I made before was I signed up to 20 affiliate programs and just kind of place them all over my site. And don't do that. I would sign up to maximum three or four. And especially for a new site, I would really recommend Amazon affiliates. And a lot of people have sometimes negative things to say about Amazon because they cut their commissions. However, we cannot deny Amazon affiliates for a newbie, it can really help you earn that 1st 100, 1000, 2000 dollars. And so what I would do is, if you're a new site right now, and you say you have ten blog posts and you have less than 1000 page views. I would go into those blog posts and right after the intro, I call these the affiliate template blog. Every single one of your blog posts. So, give me an example, give me a niche. Give me an example of a blog post.\
\
[00:03:05.610] - Liz\
Oh, gosh. Beauty and nail stuff.\
\
[00:03:08.330] - Aisha\
So, imagine you have a beauty. Let's just say you have a sustainable beauty and nail blog. Sustainable nails and beauty, right? So, let's just say, you have ten blog posts and they're not making any affiliate income. I would go after the intro and think, go to Amazon, and go to the top reviewed products, right? Take a few of those that are relevant. So, best cruelty-free nail polish, best foundation, best chemical-free foundation. So, it's four or five affiliate products from Amazon that are four star and above. I would take those four products after the intro. I would create a colored box. You can do that quite easily with gutenberg. And I would say, by the way, in a hurry, this is my favorite cruelty-free nail polish. This is my favorite foundation, which doesn't have any chemicals or harm the environment. And every single one of those ten blog posts, I would embed that up the intro. Now, you might think nobody's going to buy that. People are more interested in the content on what you wrote about. However, the beauty about Amazon affiliates is they just need the click. If they click in and buy anything within 24 hours, you get a commission.\
\
[00:04:20.120] - Aisha\
And so, your job is to just get the click. Get them over to Amazon, amazon will do the rest. They've cooked the customer, they know what your customer needs.\
\
[00:04:28.630] - Liz\
Yes, I like that. And I'm actually thinking of the new niche affiliates that I have, which is not beauty or nail. I didn't go for the easy, tell me what I should do. I'm like, yeah, I should go ahead and add those right after you're, right after the first paragraph. Okay, so. You know, that's getting the click, that is the big thing. Besides just that what you're calling the affiliate template block, where else are you putting them? How else are you, you know, ensuring you get that click?\
\
[00:05:00.990] - Aisha\
Good question. So, another thing that a lot of people I noticed, they make the mistake is they only include the links, and they include the links further down. I make sure that I have the Amazon image. It's very important that if you're recommending a product, so best cruelty-free nail polish, you recommend the link. Right? And then you also include the image. Amazon allows you to embed the image. And I'm finding that the conversion is extremely high because human beings, we're visual creatures, we might just click on it because we're curious. Then we're back on Amazon, and then we might go later on after dinner and play around. So that's number one. And number two is I make sure that I have, you know, in an article. My articles are normally at least 1500 words, so they are in depth, useful articles. We're talking at least five or six affiliate links. So, right after the intro in the template block, then a few paragraphs down, we want to make sure it's not spammy, but we also want to make sure that the reader is aware that the link is there and the link is a different color. It's very obvious.\
\
[00:06:08.150] - Liz\
Okay. And I know when you start, you said, yes, newbie bloggers should work on getting into the Amazon affiliate program, but maximum three to four programs. What would you suggest, kind of in determining what those other few programs should be like? How do you take into account the different, you know, program terms and figuring out what's going to work best?\
\
[00:06:30.570] - Aisha\
I would look at your competition, and so what I would do is sometimes when I'm overwhelmed, especially for my 6th site, right? It's a new site, it's a competitive niche. I don't know why I didn't go for an easy niche, for a competitive niche. And I was like, oh, what should I sign up for? And I took a step back and I was like, let's not reinvent the wheel. I went to my competition and I looked at the affiliates they were heavily promoting, and I was like, there's a reason why they're promoting these. And so, then I took a few of those and then I started promoting them, and I can see it's already getting clicked, which is really helpful.\
\
[00:07:04.810] - Liz\
Okay, next question then is some affiliate programs are more discerning than others. So, do you have any tips on applying to the affiliate program to ensure you get accepted? Because I feel like as a newbie blogger, you get rejected from a lot of affiliate programs. So, any tips to make sure they get accepted into the program?\
\
[00:07:24.510] - Aisha\
Yeah, so I think it's like taking a step back and saying, okay, what do they want to gain at this? So, you're talking to somebody, their whole goal is to make money from the affiliates. Your whole goal is to help your reader with an affiliate solution. And so, it's like dating. You don't go in there like, oh, please date me, date me. You go in there saying, hey, I'm a big cherry pie, you want me, right? So, I go in there and I say, Listen, this is my audience. My audience. I'm on social media. You talk about it as though it's a brand, even though even if it's 1000 page views, my 6th site is tiny. I go in there and say, this is the audience, this is my plan for promotion. This is where I'm going to promote it, and this is how I'm going to promote it, and the types of things I'm going to be writing about. And my audience is interested in this, this and this, and they happen to be in that. And so, it's basically sharing your strategy with them and being honest and saying, I want my readers to have a solution.\
\
[00:08:21.690] - Aisha\
You are my solution to my readers problem. Here is my brand and why actually, you're very lucky to work with me.\
\
[00:08:29.490] - Liz\
Okay. I like that. Yeah. And I think just being honest and putting something in the application, I think so many people get rejected because they hit the apply button and they don't kind of make an effort, and it can go a long way. Okay. So, I think a question, especially newer bloggers are wondering and struggling with is how much do you think they can reasonably earn if they're getting 1000 page views a month, maybe even less? What is like, a good kind of goal to earn with affiliate marketing, you think? I mean, obviously the programs and the commissions, it's going to vary, but a range, if you will.\
\
[00:09:06.910] - Aisha\
A niche is also important. So for personal finance, niche is going to earn way more than, say, a pet niche. Right. But just from, say, my second site, my second site had, like, 25,000 page views, and I earned $1,500. And that was not really trying because it was my second site. I reckon if I really pushed my second site with. So, let's just say 1000. So one of my sites got 1000 page views, and I'm making $89. So, $89 with 1000 page views. And so that's purely from Amazon, but also because I had lack of time. So, it's okay to focus on one. Right? So, if you say, listen, I'm going to really go hard with Amazon, when I'm more established, I can focus on other affiliates. You can, which is what I'm doing. Something also, I want to also just reassure all of you, I'm sure someone in the audience has been rejected that Amazon are not making those three sales. So, if you don't make three sales within 180 days, they kick you out. And the first time it happened to me, I was like, oh my God, I'm a failure.\
\
[00:10:06.840] - Aisha\
Listen, it's okay. You just reapply and they re accept you. It's no biggie, don't worry about it. And then you're like, oh, but what about all my affiliate links? All my Amazon links, I have to change them. Go online, google how to switch to Amazon links. There's a really quick way to do it. Or message me on Instagram, I'll teach you. I googled it. And I literally in five minutes, all my affiliate links change. So don't worry if you get rejected and kicked out, just reapply. It's no biggie.\
\
[00:10:31.220] - Liz\
Yes. And I mean, $89 may not sound like a lot, but that's more than enough for the site to pay for itself and then still have a little bit to pay you, realistically speaking. Okay, so we talked about kind of yes, you can Google and I know a few different ways you could tackle that problem. But are you using any programs to help manage your affiliate links. You know there's like Amazon pro links or whatever. Amazon pro, I don't even know what's called. There's [inaudible 00:11:00] affiliates. There's pretty links. There's, you know, Lasso and Island Affiliateable. Like are you using anything like that to help you?\
\
[00:11:09.270] - Aisha\
Honestly, I should, but I don't. Especially if you're a new blogger, don't worry about all that because when you're new, your focus should be content, quality content and converting it. And I'm sure like, Black Friday is on right now. Like, you know, when Black Friday comes again, people, oh my God, I need this, I need that. You don't need that. I made 3000 on a second site with minimum, not much effort. Then I don't use a tool I should, I should because I'm I have a site that earns more. But for my new site, you don't need it. Just get in there, add the affiliate link, add the Amazon image. You can do that without any tools.\
\
[00:11:42.050] - Liz\
Yeah, and I would say with Amazon especially, you need to either use an approved tool, you know, because you're not allowed to mask affiliate links with Amazon. So, they have very specific terms. But yeah, I'm wondering would you mind if we I can either share my screen or if you could share your screen and just show them kind of an example of building that colored block with Gutenberg or finding that link in Amazon just to give them, like, we're visual creatures. And I think seeing it on the screen is much easier to kind of than understand in your head. That'd be okay.\
\
[00:12:12.330] - Aisha\
Yeah, you could share a screen. I mean, I don't have my I'm sure you do. So I'd allow you to share your screen, if you don't mind.\
\
[00:12:20.190] - Liz\
Sure. I can pull up a site. I have several.\
\
[00:12:25.650] - Aisha\
This is why it's amazing. Honestly, you're so practical. This is so valuable for people watching.\
\
[00:12:30.060] - Liz\
Okay, let's go to this one. I'm like, which site am I going to do? Okay, so we'll just do new post. You know, make it up. There's a paragraph here. Okay. Now I want to do like a hey, you're in a hurry. So, Gutenberg, you're saying, am I just using a paragraph or am I just.\
\
[00:12:57.370] - Aisha\
Imagine you say, hey, are you in a hurry, right? And then let's just say you add a link. This cruelty-free nail polish, right?\
\
[00:13:07.560] - Liz\
Yes.\
\
[00:13:09.130] - Aisha\
The cruelty-free nail polish is the part that you link. So, you copy that and then you add the affiliate link there. So, you click on the link there. You add the affiliate link.\
\
[00:13:19.840] - Liz\
That's not a real thing, but we're gonna.\
\
[00:13:20.980] - Aisha\
And make sure when you click on it right, the affiliate link, you have to mark it as open a new tab and no follow. It's quite important that you mark it as open a new tab and no follow. Because any sponsored links, google has required us to declare them as no follow and open these up. Perfect. Okay, so imagine you created a whole blog, right. So now what you do is you basically copy the whole thing. Yeah. Go on more content.\
\
[00:13:49.020] - Liz\
Yeah. Okay.\
\
[00:13:50.910] - Aisha\
So, let's say you copy both.\
\
[00:13:53.690] - Liz\
Okay.\
\
[00:13:54.670] - Aisha\
So you want to create a blog, right?\
\
[00:13:57.240] - Liz\
Okay.\
\
[00:14:02.890] - Aisha\
So, let's say, hey, are you in a hurry? And more content. I turn that into a blog. So, maybe both of them, copy them together.\
\
[00:14:10.480] - Liz\
Okay, sorry.\
\
[00:14:11.580] - Aisha\
Yeah. And then on the three, yeah, then I put group.\
\
[00:14:17.470] - Liz\
Okay.\
\
[00:14:18.340] - Aisha\
This is going to be a reusable block, right? And then you click on the background on the right and you're going to turn that into a different color, whatever you want.\
\
[00:14:29.510] - Liz\
Go with like a, yellow.\
\
[00:14:29.970] - Aisha\
Yeah, there you go. And so, if you want, if you guys want to turn into a reusable block. So ,let's say you click on that and then add two reusable blocks. So, it could be sustainable products or whatever. Yeah.\
\
[00:14:49.230] - Aisha\
So now you have ten blog posts that you want to add this right after the intro. Boom, boom, boom. Every single one, you add the reusable blocks. And so now when someone reads it, it pops out and allow what's, this? And they click on it.\
\
[00:15:01.460] - Liz\
Yeah. So, then if I want to do, it'll pop right up, right? Okay, awesome. Hopefully that makes sense. This is obviously very [crosstalk 00:15:15] \
\
[00:15:17.240] - Aisha\
That's amazing. Yeah, exactly. And it makes a huge difference because your link is very high up, it's popping out, it's obvious, and it's a solution relevant to your audience. You add that right after the intro.\
\
[00:15:28.140] - Liz\
Okay. And I would say, like, this is a template for this specific affiliate link. It's not for, you know to use this as a template and then edit it for different affiliate links. Correct?\
\
[00:15:40.340] - Aisha\
Correct.\
\
[00:15:41.110] - Liz\
Okay. I'm just making sure I understand the reusable blocks.\
\
[00:15:44.170] - Aisha\
Yeah, so, these are going to the same affiliate link.\
\
[00:15:46.280] - Aisha\
Because if you have, like your site, right. It's likely that if you have a sustainable beauty site, it's going to be relevant products. But if you want to change your product, then create it if a block.\
\
[00:15:56.750] - Liz\
Yeah. Okay, perfect. I just wanted to make sure that was clear. Okay. Anything else you think we should share? I don't know if I should keep sharing my screen or if you think we're good.\
\
[00:16:07.980] - Aisha\
I think we're good, but I just want to share a few tips on also conversion. Right. If we're not, when we run out of time, let me know. But here is something I really, really noticed, because I run a team of writers, I train people how to write, and after six sites, I can't do it on myself. And the biggest mistake that people make is the introduction. Right. When you are writing an affiliate post, or even not a normal post, you might be like, you're looking for the best sustainable products, here are ten stainless products. That's a mistake. You need to think about the pain points of somebody who is Googled best cruelty free nail polish. Number one, what are the pain points why are they googling that? What are they interested in? Number two, you need to then also establish your authority in the introduction. For example, you say, hey, are you looking for cruelty free nail polish? I'm sure that you're really sick of reading about these nail polishes that are being tested on animals. I'm sure maybe you're worried about how it affects on our environment. Don't worry. I am very passionate about sustainability and I have a sustainable blog I run and you talk about your experience and let me share with you my favorite product.\
\
[00:17:23.530] - Aisha\
That's tip number two. You have nine options, right? Don't just go to nine options, give them the first option and the best. Because people get decision fatigue. And I learnt this mistake through my trial and error. I used to just give nine products. And then I realized people don't read nine, they have decision fatigue. So, you say, this is my favorite product because and you give them the reason why. You give them why you choose that. Or if you want, if you really want to make it valuable, you give them three options at the top, highest quality, budget friendly, and the middle compromise. Okay? And when you do that, people want you to tell them, people want to be led. You're like, listen, this is the best if you can afford it, this is the best quality. If you're on a budget, it's okay, you can try this. So, you are giving them solutions, right? And the final major tip that I want to share is, and this is the huge thing is when you are sharing the pros and cons and the features, the mistake we make is we say this is a cruelty free product in red. It's really cute\
\
[00:18:30.910] - Aisha\
Okay, and why would I care? It's really cute and it will stand out during your dinner date. You've got to give the benefit, feature and then benefit. Often we talk about features but we don't say why. Like this foundation is super smooth. Okay, and? It's super smooth, so it will cover all your blemishes and feature, benefit, feature benefits. And finally when you're talking about the cons, am I going on too much? Sorry.\
\
[00:18:59.220] - Liz\
No, you're great. I love this.\
\
[00:19:01.110] - Aisha\
So, when you're talking about the cons, and this was something I noticed when I write of my book, she said the cons are it wipes off really fast. I thought, right, okay, so I'm not compelled to buy this product. So, if you're going to mention a con, think about how we can mitigate it. And so, if it's going to wipe off quickly, right, so you say it wipes off quickly but you don't need much to apply or it's in a really small bottle, so it's easy to carry around. You've got to mitigate that con, especially if it's in that top three.\
\
[00:19:36.730] - Liz\
Okay. No, I love that. That's a great point. And I'm thinking about some of my affiliate posts, I'm like, maybe this is why they're not converting as well.\
\
[00:19:48.800] - Aisha\
I think it's too trial and error, like for me testing and think, oh, that makes sense now because I recently went and bought winter clothes in Amazon and I remember reading a post, I just remember feeling overwhelmed. I'm like, which do I pick? Tell me the best winter coat. And then I went on a post and said, this is the best, because I was outright click buy. Give them the commission. Done.\
\
[00:20:06.940] - Liz\
Yeah. Yeah. No, I love it. I also love that as bloggers are always like, do I want to give this person a commission? Did they give me enough information? Do I want to go look at a different one to click on it? You know what that is?\
\
[00:20:23.180] - Aisha\
Actually, yes. Are you deserving of my click? Yes.\
\
[00:20:28.860] - Liz\
Okay, any final tips? And then I know you have some additional resources you're going to share, but any final last tips?\
\
[00:20:37.840] - Aisha\
So, I think I've shared most of them. Oh, final tips. Okay. Don't be afraid to go for super low volume keywords, especially as a beginner, if they are affiliate type posts, right? And so, if you haven't already, make sure you target affiliate posts such as best, best nail products, best cruelty-free makeup, best make sure you target if you're a new blogger, you already have ten info posts. Make sure that your next ten has best, but then don't just randomly target them. You need to make sure they obviously will do well on Google, right? And so you need to obviously learn SEO. If you don't, I don't know if they can access and buy the last year pass. There's amazing SEO tips on there. So, often when we go for SEO topics, people think, oh, I need to go for low search volume. When you are targeting affiliate type posts such as best cruelty free, don't be afraid to even go for a search volume of even 10. Ten is okay, because you're not going for people go for high volume because they want to monetize with ads, but you don't need that much traffic to convert, convert into money.\
\
[00:21:45.770] - Aisha\
And so a lot of my, like, posts have like, search volume of 10, 20 and they get on page one and then they convert and they convert. So, it's okay to go for low volume.\
\
[00:21:55.570] - Liz\
Yeah, especially when you're doing something like Amazon, right? Because okay, maybe that search volume is only ten, but ten people went, one person clicked on it, they got that, and then they bought a $500 mattress, too, and you got that commission, right? So, just because it's low search volume doesn't necessarily mean it probably means better chance of your converting because you're going to rank faster. But also it doesn't necessarily mean like, low amount of money. It's a different strategy. It's a different monetization strategy that's going to have a different kind of SEO strategy in mind as well.\
\
[00:22:27.330] - Aisha\
Hopefully. Because you're not going to try to go up against these big time bloggers, you need to know, right? What's the strategy that's good for me as a new blogger? Go for low volume. Go for the low volume affiliate keywords. When you've established authority, okay, you can go for the highest search volume later.\
\
[00:22:41.720] - Liz\
Yes. Yes, I love it. Okay, so why don't you tell them about some of the resources you have that they can check out?\
\
[00:22:48.430] - Aisha\
Okay, so I'm going to create I'm doing this special for you guys. I'm going to create a step by step plan for you guys to go from here to making your first affiliate sale. So, I'll share it, and it's free. I will say step one, do this. Step two, do this, by the end of it, you follow the exact process. And I know it works because I use it on my own site. By the end of it, you have the exact process I follow to make my first affiliate sale. My sister, she has a sustainable site, and she followed this with 100 page views, and she made her first sale.\
\
[00:23:19.280] - Liz\
That's awesome.\
\
[00:23:20.290] - Aisha\
So, I'm going to share that, and you know, if you want, you can also contact me on Instagram.

Hello, everybody. Welcome, welcome, welcome. I'm so happy and excited that you are joining me on the Blogger Breakthrough Summit. Thank you so much for your time. I'm going to try to make the next 30 minutes as valuable as possible for you.\
\
[00:00:26.320] - Aisha\
Today, I'm going to teach you how to earn $1,000 with 1,000 followers. My name is Aisha Preece. Who am I? Let me just click on that. Okay, so as a bit of quick background, I set up my blog in 2017 and like most people, I had no idea what I was doing and it didn't make any money or any real money. Over time, as we all do, we make our mistakes. But I used to think digital products was a really advanced, really complicated thing to earn from, which really felt out of reach for me. I only dabbled in it two years ago. My first product, I remember thinking, It's too good to be true. I have to be a graphic designer. I'm not creative. I thought I need to be creative. I need to have lots of money and time. It's a complicated setup. Honestly, they're limiting beliefs. This is what I really thought about my digital products when I began as a newbie blogger. But eventually, I managed to try it. And I launched my first digital product on social media, and it was an e-book, and it made me $6,000. And I had definitely less than a thousand followers, because for me, I prefer to have quality over quantity. I don't pay my bills with number of followers. So for me, I'd rather have less followers, but they're engaged. And back in turn... In 2022, I was a newbie. Nobody knew me. Nobody knows me still. But the point is I made $6,000, and that for me was life-changing money. It was proof that people would spend their hard-earned money on my products. And then I decided to test and try. And as my blog business grew and I had more blogs, I set up digital products for the different blogs I own, and I've earned way over $100,000 from digital products. I really, really think digital products is a real tool to financial freedom because you make it once and you can sell it millions of times. It's very... Almost cost of nothing to create and set up, and it can help a lot of people. I think for me, when they talk about passive income, when I'm traveling with my family, when I'm going around the world, when I'm hanging out with my cat, you might see a cat tail in a moment, I can still earn, and I'm still earning digital products. When I'm recording this, I'll check my email and there'll be somebody who has bought digital product of mine, and that's such a privilege. And this is an untapped market because a lot of people think digital products are complicated, like I did. They think it's too difficult. I don't know what to create. I don't know how to sell it. No one's going to buy it. All these things, I used to think. And so I'm here to teach you the exact things I did and do to make money and sell digital products if you have a low number of followers. It could be Twitter, it could be Instagram, it could be anywhere you are on your platform, you can sell digital products and make money with less than 1,000 followers. I know this because I've done it and my students have done it too. Let me just reassure you that if you're sitting there thinking, "Man, I only have 300 followers," you can make money from these digital products.\
\
[00:03:52.900] - Aisha\
Moving on. Before we begin, I know that we have our phones with us, and I have my phone on me, and it's basically tracking how long, so I don't go over time limit. But can you just literally for the next 25 minutes, put your phone away, give yourself that privilege, because so often we're being pulled in all these different directions. Let's gift ourselves 30 minutes to learn and let your brain focus. I asked you that. Give yourself that privilege. You get the gift of not being pulled in other directions for the next 25 minutes. Let's try that, okay?\
\
[00:04:27.160] - Aisha\
Now, today what you're going to learn is what an earth do you create? What digital products should you create? Because for me, that was my biggest barrier. I was like, I don't know what to create. What do I make? Who wants to buy my digital product? What should I make? And especially at the beginning, when you have not many followers. Number two is what to price it because I often felt like I don't want to overprice it, then no one buys it, then I don't want to underprice it, then it's not valuable and no one buys it anyway. So what do you price it? I'm going to show you exactly what I price my digital products, especially at the beginning. And then how to offer and position your digital product so people buy it. I'm very grateful and privileged that every time I launch a digital product, it sells. It's such a nice feeling because I used to have this fear that I'd launch and there was crickets. I've developed some strategies and really useful ticks, tips, not ticks, tips that I use whenever I'm selling digital products, which really help me and sell my digital products. It's worth my time investment to create the digital product.\
\
[00:05:37.630] - Aisha\
Let us begin. First of all, you might be thinking, Well, how does this work? How am I going to make that thousand dollars? I'm very practical. I'd like somebody to remove the fluff and just tell me what to do. When we talk about that amount, that big amount of a thousand dollars, when I break it down, it really helps me. You could sell a $9 product to 100 people. So if you have 300 followers, you could sell it to the 100 of those. $17 product to 59 people and $49 product to 21 people. And so you will realize you don't need that many followers. You just need engaged followers that care about what you're talking about. And how do you do that? I'll teach you in a moment, okay?\
\
[00:06:21.800] - Aisha\
So for me, sometimes when I'm thinking, Okay, do I feel it's easier for me to create a $9 product and sell it to 100? Or is it easier for me to sell $49 and 20? You might test these different ones, and I tested all three. But my question is, and really helps me overcome this limiting belief that nobody's going to buy it, is what would you spend? What would you spend? What do you spend on? Also, we think nothing on buying dinner, spending dinner, buying coffee, and spending money every day on things which cost way more than $9, $17, and $49 but are way less valuable. You buy digital products, a good one. It can really like... I've had $17 products that have added dollars to my bottom line. They're so valuable. And so first of all, what would you spend that will help you. What would you expect for $9, $17, $49? Because sometimes we might get into this trap of thinking you have to throw the kitchen sink and give everything, but actually it's $9. It could be a drink for somebody. So we give quick solutions in that $9.\
\
[00:07:29.580] - Aisha\
If we look here, I've got a tip for you, right? Start small. If it's your first time creating a digital product and if you have a small audience, don't invest... Personally, and people might disagree with me, but I prefer to start small and test because what happens is I've seen some people, they spend all this energy and time creating a huge course, and then it doesn't sell, they get demotivated, they give up. I think let's create a small product, lower the price, let's get some feedback. If it doesn't work, you haven't spent too much time and money and effort in it. But it allows you to be more flexible. And so things like for those prices between $9 to $49, you can create a planner, an e-book, a workshop, or a mini course. And all of these are created. So I've had a planner, sold it for $9. Workshop, $49. E-book, $17 to $49. Mini course, $49. You can have $37, $49. And so by starting small, it takes the pressure off, and you don't need to... You can just create little bite-sized products which you can test and allow you to get feedback from your customers. Let's look at the time. How are we doing? How am I doing? Good time. I'm not going over the time. Okay, good.\
\
[00:08:48.680] - Aisha\
Now, so we know how you're going to do it. You know what kind of product. And also... What was the previous one? Give me a second. Yeah, "How"? We know "What kind of product." Now, number one, tip number one, okay? Most importantly, when you are on your platform, whether it's Instagram, whether it's Twitter, I don't know, whatever it is, it's so important that you are creating content relating to your digital product. If you haven't created it yet, think about what you're going to create. Decide on it. "Okay, I want to create an e-book." Great. In your head, that e-book solves a problem, right? You need to make sure that the content you're putting out is related to the digital product. We want a focused audience. If you have 300 followers, we want those 300 followers to be in your niche, interested in the topic that you're going to sell. I really recommend talking about the pain points and the problems that people in your niche face and solutions. I don't think you should just reserve solutions to a digital product because you need to show people that you are of value, you can provide and you can teach and you have tips and you do that for free in your Instagram or Twitter or a social media platform.\
\
[00:10:09.410] - Aisha\
For example\'97I'm very practical, I hate when people say try this theory, theory, but what about practically? For example, imagine you are in the parenting niche. Let's just say you have a mini course on how to help your baby sleep. Really? That would be amazing. I've been babysitting my nephew the last couple of weeks, and wow, I need a course like that. Maybe a little mini course on some hacks to get your baby more settled and you want to sleep. That's going to be a paid product, right? In your free content, think about the problems that parents are facing relating to that. You could maybe give a tip. How to know if your baby has a tummy ache? How to know if your baby is cold? How to know some tips to help your baby's tummy get settled? How I get my baby in a routine? These are all questions I have because I've just babysat my nephew and he's a baby, and I don't have kids. These are questions I'm asking as a newbie, right? Then it is travel. I have a couple of travel blogs. If you're a digital product could be how to travel solo safely, you could talk about in your free content, countries that are safest for solo female travelers, gadgets that you use, places that are dangerous for solo female travelers, things you wish you knew.\
\
[00:11:31.050] - Aisha\
The problems that your audience are facing and solutions are all in your free content. Then you can package... Now don't be afraid to package some of the tips and put them into your paid product. Obviously, you're going to have more tips that are more in-depth. But people, not everybody has seen your social media, all the content. I really think that giving free content and giving value is really good, and you can use some of those tips in your paid product anyway. Another example, journaling. I think journaling is fantastic. What are the problems people face when they need journaling? How to overcome overwhelm? What to do if you're feeling demotivated? What if you're sad? How do you keep your thoughts organized? These are all problems. Then you mentioned solutions and journaling is a really good solution. Finally, another example, crafts. I know, for example, in crochet and knitting, they have these patterns. They have these digital product patterns you could print and they sell them. It's amazing. You can share different challenges that you face, like how do you know what pattern, which to follow? You can also actually share some of your patterns and share how you managed to do it in this amount of time and how much easier it was because you now have guidance.\
\
[00:12:47.240] - Aisha\
And so talk about the pain point, mention the solution and create content relating to the digital product. And I promise you, you will get targeted audience that will buy your products, okay? Because we live in a big world with people with different interests. But we want to speak to the people and connect with the people in our niche by solving the problems that people are facing in your niche, okay? That's how you build a relationship. Now, number two, this is so important because you could talk till you're blue in the face all day long about how amazing your product is, but people want to see proof. Like I said, I'm very black and white. Show me proof that your product works. And also how it affects your life before and after positively. For example, if you're in a parenting niche, and you're selling a mini course on helping the baby sleep, if you don't want to show your kid's face, you could blur out the face, or you could just have your baby there and show your baby sleeping. Show you having a bubble bath because you now have time in the evening because your baby's sleeping.\
\
[00:13:51.670] - Aisha\
Talk about how you feel now that you know how to put your baby to sleep. For me, when I was babysitting my nephew, I felt sheer panic every day. I was like, How do I make this creature sleep? This beautiful creature that opens its eyes in the morning and smiles, becomes a little monster and screams. I have no idea what to do with it. If the mother's not there, mother had to go to the doctor or whatever. For me, if I had a solution to say, "Listen, reduce your panic, reduce your overwhelm that you know how to help the baby sleep," Wow! You know what? After this, I'm going to google digital product "how to help the baby sleep." And I don't even have a baby. Travel, for example. Let's say you have a solo female travel. You want to help solo travelers travel more. Talk about how confident you feel now, how happy and inspired you feel that you can travel alone, that you don't have to wait for people, share your life and share proof of your life now that you have your product. Similar with a food blog, often food bloggers have recipes. You can share actual delicious food, share pictures of your family enjoying your food, share that, to be honest, if you have a food blog, any of your recipe, just show your food. Honestly, that's proof enough, right? But I'm sure there are challenges when you don't have a recipe book, you don't know what to order like you talk about don't know what to order in the groceries, spending a lot of money on groceries because you don't have a guided recipe book to help you cook delicious food, nutritious food.\
\
[00:15:22.550] - Aisha\
Number two is share your own proof. This is really interesting because I'm in many niches. Excuse me, there's something in my eyelash. I don't know what it is. It's like dust. This, for example, for me, I have blogs in the travel niche, I have blogs in other niches, but I'm also in the blogging niche. I teach blogging. This is a bit awkward for me because it feels obnoxious to share income screenshots. But if you follow my Instagram, quite often I will share proof of what I earn. I'll share my income, my digital product revenue. I'll share my affiliate revenue. I'll share my ad revenue. I will share screenshots. I'll blur out any sensitive information. Because for me, anybody can say, I earn money blogging. Anybody can say I earn money from digital products affiliate. Show me the proof. My audience know, and I have a really tiny but mighty Instagram community, they know when I say something, I have proof. I back it up with the receipt. They will see screenshots of all the things that I talk about. It builds credibility. It's so important that you do that.\
\
[00:16:23.030] - Aisha\
Now, number three, don't be afraid to share the bad. This is something a lot of people feel embarrassed about because it means, "Oh, I'm not an expert if I share the bad," but we are all humans. You can be an expert and still share the bad. You share the journey. When you share the bad, people will believe you when you share the good. For example, let's say if you're in a parenting blog, you can share a video of the baby screaming its head off, or you're looking really tired because you're like, do you know, some days you really could try everything in the guide and mini course? Babies are babies. They're going to cry. That's how it is, right? Or if you have a food blog, sometimes you might burn something. I think I felt quite overwhelmed the other day, and I just burnt my... You know what? I tried to make chicken satay with peanut sauce, and I had great, great notions of becoming the next master chef, and that baby burnt. I burnt the chicken. It was black and I was so embarrassed. You've got to share real situations. Life is not perfect. For me, I'll share the journey. When I'm sharing about my blogging journey, when we've had Google updates, ups and downs, when you get troll comments, when some days you wake up and you just don't want to work, stuff like that. Share it. Share the good and the bad. It's okay. People will relate to you and they will appreciate that you're human too. You're not perfect. Number three is don't be afraid sometimes to share the bad and share it. It's fine.\
\
[00:17:47.240] - Aisha\
Number four... How are we doing for time, folks? Let me just check. Okay, good. We're doing good. Number four is give access for free to some people in your community and get a genuine testimonial. Because when you're at the beginning, you don't have anybody who's taking your course. It's only you who's vouched for your course. But there's no better vouch. There's no better proof than real people who say, "You know what? I took this course and it changed my life." Showing proof from others builds credibility and authority. At the beginning, you thinking your product is awesome, people are going to think you're biased, which you are, because hopefully you created the best product you could. You need proof that other people think the same. I have friends in my community that are all really loyal students. I just tap them on the shoulder virtually and say, Hey, do you want to take my course? I genuinely need feedback. If you think it's rubbish, tell me. I'd love to know. But if it's good, if I give you this course, can I get a testimonial? And all 10 out of 10 times people will say yes. Give them access for free, get a testimonial, and get genuine testimonials. What you need to share is how it changed before and after. A generic, Oh, this course is great, or This plan is great, is to be honest, great. But really helpful if they give tangible feedback like this, like my SEO course, people say, "My traffic increased from zero to 20,000 as a newbie." That's real proof, and they share screenshots of proof. Or they say, Affiliate marketing. I made my first $100 affiliate sale. Or they say, "I feel less overwhelmed if you're a parent. I feel less overwhelmed. My life is so much more organized now." Share the before and after. Share tangible things that people can relate to when they're giving tests. Tell them, if you give me testimonials, can you tell me how it affected your life? How did it improve your life? That's number four. That's something I do when I'm selling my digital products. I definitely get some testimonials before I then sell it to the rest of my audience. So start with that. Now, I'm going to actually share a step-by-step plan at the end. If you're thinking or writing this down, what do I do first? Just take a moment, listen and learn. At the end, I'm going to share a step-by-step plan, okay?\
\
[00:20:10.590] - Aisha\
Another tip, and not many people talk about this, and I think they should, is sharing your values and your care for your students. Because values bind and unite similar people. People are more likely to buy and connect and relate to people who have the same values. People buy from people they like and trust. Don't be afraid to share your values. My values, and my students know this, is freedom. Freedom is so important to me. As a woman, I grew up in an Asian culture with a lot of conservative beliefs and whatnot background. To me, female empowerment and freedom is so important. Having the financial independence to make your own decisions is very important to me. To me, having said that, freedom not also of financial independence, but freedom of choices. My community knows that my whole motto is, "How can I work less and earn more so I can do the things I love with people I love?" That is literally my life motto. How can I work less and earn more so I can do the things I love with people I love? When I make decisions in the way I teach and everything I do for my community, I think I want you to have more time, more money so you can do the things you love with people you love, and that value permeates throughout my whole business. People who relate to that value, they listen to me, they buy from me. There are people who perhaps they don't want to have that word of mouth, but they want to hustle hard.\
\
[00:21:43.920] - Aisha\
They have these bros out there like, "Hustle hard, 24-7, work, work, work." No, that's fine. They'll join another community. My community is about we work, but we also have good life balance. We eat good food, we exercise, we spend time with family. How do we have that balance? Share your values. People will relate to you. You know what's important to you. You know what you love, you think, mention it. Mention your values. Also, don't be afraid to share how much you care about your students. People forget to mention this, but you know your offering. You know your customer support with your students. How well you support and care for your students will determine whether they buy the next product. I have to say, my recurrence rate is that if they buy the first product, they buy the next five. That's my recurrence rate with my students because they know, number one, that my digital product will overdeliver for the price. Number two, I'll take care of them, send them voice notes, ask them how they are, how's their mom, and you can share that and really share your love for your students because people think, "Well, that's weird. Why should I share it?" Share it because you care about your students. Let them know that you care for them. People need to care for each other. I do this, and if you follow my Instagram, you'll see, in the stories, especially, I will just sometimes randomly message my students like, "Hey, how's it going? I heard you had a bad day the other day. Is everything okay?" And so share that you care for your students and let others know that if they join your community, they will be cared for also, okay?\
\
[00:23:15.770] - Aisha\
Now, number six, discounts are great because, number one, it gives people the opportunity to try with less risk. If it's a price that they're not comfortable with, it feels risky. They're like, "Is it worth my time? With my money?" But if you give them a deep discount and it's a limited time discount, they can test and try your product with less risk, number one. Number two is human nature, we need urgency. I will procrastinate till the cows come home if you give me the opportunity. But if someone tells me, Listen, Black Friday is ending on Monday. You need to get 40% off, if not you'll pay the full price.\
\
[00:23:49.760] - Aisha\
I'm more likely to reach into my pocket. I need that push. And so give a limited time discount. Give a coupon code to your Instagram community and say, "It expires in, I don't know, three days" or "Expires at midnight." Give a limited time discount. Honestly, it really makes a difference if you really want to... Some people need encouragement. If you really believe your product's good, then I don't see an issue with giving them a bit of encouragement so they can actually get to use your product and benefit from it. Now, finally, let me check the time. Oh, we're doing it. We're going to keep going.\
\
[00:24:25.460] - Aisha\
Now, final tip. I always mention this, and I think it's so important because, yes, we are in this business to make money. We need to pay our bills. But I also think that we're in this for the long run. We're not here for just a quick one-off sale. We're in this business and we want it to sustain us in the long run. I don't believe that you should sell if it's not right for them because they'll just disappear and bad-mouth you, and then you have an angry customer.\
\
[00:24:53.150] - Aisha\
I say honestly, listen, I genuinely believe this product will help solve this problem. It will help you. It will make a difference to your life. But if you are in severe financial difficulty, I don't think you should buy it. The amount of times I have students, I rejected and said, "No, I cannot take you on as a student because I think right now your priorities are to pay off your debt." I want to make sure that I take into account I'm not taking advantage of them. If they show to me that they can afford it, that they've got a plan, great, we can talk. Another thing is if you genuinely don't think it would help them, let's say, for example, let's just say I approach somebody and I say, "I want to know how to help a baby sleep," but then I don't plan to have a baby and I'm never going to see my nephew again. If I say that, and I'm just like, "Oh, do you think I need it?" And they're like, "Yeah, I think you need it." "I don't need it because I'm never going to be around a baby again.\
\
[00:25:45.230] - Aisha\
Let's just say I say that, right? So don't push something if they genuinely don't need it. If, let's say, for example, someone's a new blogger and there's a really expensive tool, if you don't think they need it, don't push it. They're going to come to you later on. Honestly, trust and referrals brings you a lot of income, goodwill. Think long term. Don't be afraid to disclaim it. If you genuinely don't think someone should buy it, say don't buy this if X, Y, and Z, and not those fake if you don't want to take action. "If", those are fake "ifs," right? These are genuine "ifs." If you are in severe financial difficulty, I think you should focus on those for now. This product maybe you can get next time. For me, if it's genuinely not good for my student, then I won't sell it to them. They say to me, "Oh, I don't ever plan to travel solo and I don't actually enjoy traveling solo. Do you think I should get this solo travel kit?" Well, no, because if you don't plan to travel solo, then if you're curious, get it. But if you don't ever plan to travel solo, then maybe you don't need it. For me, don't be afraid to say no, because you will get way more sales when you are genuinely recommending something later on, which is going to help them. Those are the seven things that I recommend that I do and I implement to sell digital product when I had a thousand followers, less than a thousand followers.\
\
[00:27:08.120] - Aisha\
Now, let's talk about steps because I'm very practical. I need someone to say, "Oh, okay, now what?" You're sitting here right now, you have less than a thousand followers. What do you do? Step one, forget everything else. Let's not complicate everything else. Step one, decide on a product. Is it a planner? Is it a mini course? Pick a small product less than 50 bucks. Decide on it. Allocate time, create it. Figure out what problem it's solving and create that product. You've got that product. Great. Now it's time for you to go back to your social platform or whatever platform you're on. Start brainstorming problems that your audience are facing. What are the problems they are facing in that niche? If you really struggle, go to ChatGPT. I'm sure ChatGPT can answer. Sit down, google it, find out what are the issues people are facing?\
\
[00:27:57.570] - Aisha\
Write down on the list. Start creating Reels, Twitter, content that solves... Mention the problem, mention the solution. Mention the problem, mention the solution. Number three, you say you've done that, great. It's next step. Start sharing proof of how your digital product is working for you and how it affects your life positively. Share a picture of you living your best life. That's okay. How different things are less anxiety, less panic, how you feel more confident. Share before and after. If it's blogging, share the income you're earning. Number four, once you've done that, approach a few people in your community and offer maybe three, maximum three, and offer your product for free in exchange for a really solid testimonial, sharing how it changed their lives to how it improved their lives. Get that screenshot and you can add it to your sales page. Or if you don't have a sales page, you can share it on your Instagram anyway, right? Then what you do after that is I would share your values. In your content, start sharing your values. What's important to you? Why is solo travel important to you? Why do you think that you want your baby to have a routine and sleep?\
\
[00:29:07.030] - Aisha\
Why? Because you need your sanity, you want your baby to be calm. You want to have organization in your life. You want it to be a mom that's it. That's it. That's trying to help organize your life and have balance, right? So share your values, because some mums that may not be important to them, if you're in the parenting niche. Now, number six I want to do after that is offer a limited time discount. So mention that here's a coupon code, or if you get it from this time to this time, launch price, you get it 40% or 50% or 20% or whatever. Give a limited time discount and honor it. Honor that. If you say you're going to raise the price, raise the price. Because it's not fair for people that have bought it when it's a discount, and maybe they had to borrow money or whatever. Make sure that you honor that if you say that the price is going to go up. Finally, give it honest disclaimer. If you don't think it's good, don't buy this if, it's not for you. Just be very honest and turn away money if it's not good for the customer.\

I'm okay with that because money will come back later. If you take these steps, even with less than a thousand followers, I'm very confident that you can make money from your digital product. I know this because I've done it and my students have too. Now, I know a big objection. I hope you found those useful. First of all, I hope you found those tips useful. Now, a big, big, big barrier that I faced when I started selling digital products was, there's so many other people selling the same thing. How do I stand out? I don't know how to differentiate my product. How do I create something that's useful and helpful that everyone else hasn't done? I'm going to create a digital product training, actually, specially for the Blogger Breakthrough Summit. I'm going to record this record video training for you after this. It's called, very simply, How to overcome competition when selling a digital product. I really don't have an issue with competition. I'm in a really competitive niche. But there are things that I do and there's strategies I follow and there's things that I know that have really helped me not even worry about competition.\
\
[00:31:21.170] - Aisha\
I don't need to worry about competition, and there's a reason why. What you can do is you can click... Let me think here. This is training to access the freebie. This is free, only for Blogger Breakthrough Summit, right? You're going to need to go on the right side here, right? This is a mock-up, it's not mine. On the bottom of your page, on the right, you're going to see this thing on the right. That is where the freebie is going to be. You click on that and you will get access to that training. Okay, maybe not. Then you get access to this training. Then what you can do is go through the video training and really understand how you can remove that barrier of worrying about competition and having a product, which there's so many people in your niche. I think I'm doing... Yeah, I've done okay for time. I'm really pleased. What I want... Okay, yeah. If you'd love to stay in touch, I'm really active on Instagram. I always reply to my messages. Come and connect with me. Say hi. I say hi back. If you have any genuine issues or challenges with selling digital products, send me a message.\
\
[00:32:29.640] - Aisha\
I'm there. I'll voice note back. I'll try and help you. I'm really passionate about this. Follow me on Instagram. Aisha Preece, there. There we go. Also, if you want, you can drop me an email. Maybe you're shy, you don't want to approach me on Instagram, that's fine. Drop me an email. I respond way faster on Instagram, but hey, I'm here to help. I really, really think if you have so much to offer, you're here, you're showing up, you're watching this, and that's half the battle, right? Now you just need to go and just create it and sell it. I'd love to hear, actually, when you do sell it, let me know how you get on, what challenges you have, and let's stay in touch. I wish you lots of luck. Thank you so much for your time. Thank you. Reach over and pat yourself on the back. You did so well to make it to this part. You should be proud of your self for gifting yourself this time. I wish you lots of luck.\

**Transcript:**\
[00:00:03.220] - Alex Okell\
Hello, everybody, and welcome to the Unlock Affiliate Marketing Masterclass a three-step framework to adding affiliate marketing into your business. I'm Alex Okell, and I'm really excited to be part of the 2024 Blogger Breakthrough Summit. Let's get started. I am pretty sure that you are one of two people. Either you've never participated in affiliate marketing, and to be honest you're probably a bit confused what it is, how it can fit into your business. Is it the sleasiest thing you've ever heard? How can you do it well? There's a lot of questions. Or maybe you have added some links here and there throughout your business. Maybe you've scattered some into a blog post, but you might be making pennies if anything, and it's more of an afterthought and something that you occasionally remember to do and post your link on your stories, and then not much happens. Which one are you? Whichever one you are this Masterclass is for you. Because I know that this is where you're at right now with your business. You are swapping your time for money, you are relying on one revenue stream, and you are constantly on the hamster wheel of having to create new, free, and paid resources to support your clients.\
\
[00:01:18.840] - Alex\
Because maybe you are coaching them in one aspect of life, of business, whatever it is that you coach, they just need a little something else to supplement the work that you are doing. So you're either completely reinventing the wheel and having to create more and more resources, new courses, new freebies, new PDFs, whereas actually there is so much out there that you could be promoting to your current clients, to your audience, to your community which would actually be a much better fit than us trying to be a Jack of all trades. If this is you right now, I feel you because this is where I was at. So this is a little bit about me. Before we get started, I think it's important for you to know who you're learning from. So my name is Alex Okell. I am a nutritionist. I am the founder of the PCOS Collective which is a non-diet PCOS education hub, and I help online business owners make one-to-one optional with expansive product suites and affiliate marketing. And a bit more personal stuff about me, I absolutely love spinning, I love reading, and I love deep diving into pop culture. So, I think it's important for you to know a bit about my business.\
\
[00:02:23.390] - Alex\
And I'm going to be talking in this example all about my nutrition business. So I have my two businesses. I have the PCOS Collective and I have alexokell.com which is where you will have found me today. So, a little bit about my business. Before in my nutrition business, I was working one-to-one. I was -- really felt like I was making little impact because I could only work with those people who could afford to work with me. I couldn't scale my income. I was at a point where I didn't want to put up my prices anymore. It didn't feel comfortable. It didn't feel right to expand my prices. I didn't really want to bring in any team members to take on clients for me. It just never was how I saw my business going. I didn't want to be a manager. It just didn't feel good to me. And I had a jam-packed calendar and I was completely burnt out and I went through a really awful period in January 2022 of burnout where I really lost interest in absolutely everything, business and personal. So I was just at the point of, you know, rock bottom. That's really how it felt. And now, I've completely kind of switched up my business model, and I have more income than ever, more time, freedom, and I really feel like I'm making more impact because I'm getting emails and responses from people who are absolutely loving the content that me and my small team of freelancers are creating.\
\
[00:03:39.530] - Alex\
And I just feel like I'm making a much bigger impact. And affiliate marketing really has been a key part of this because the way that my business works in terms of my nutrition business is it is a content hub. So we create free content, and then we sell low cost digital products that really, kind of, really nicely supplement the work that we're doing, and we also offer affiliate links throughout our articles. And I love this way of working because I always really felt this resistance. I felt like I had this message that I wanted to get out there. I had this way of working which was this non-diet approach to nutrition which not many people were doing in the PCOS space, and there really wasn't good resources for people with PCOS. So, it always felt like I was just holding it in when I could only work with one-to-one clients. To completely switching this way of working and having now this content hub where people can really purchase through our affiliate links or purchase our low cost digital products has really, really helped. But they also, you know, they can -- they get so much information and content and educational content just from what we're putting up on the site. So it just really, really good and it feels really aligned because I know I'm helping people, and the way that we make our money is through these digital products and affiliate marketing.\
\
[00:04:49.900] - Alex\
So, If you are completely brand new to affiliate marketing and you're not sure what affiliate income is and you don't understand how our business makes money through that, then I'm here to tell you all about it. But affiliate income is not a get-rich-quick scheme. It's not an all-or-nothing approach, and it's not sleazy. So let's go back to the start. It's not a get-rich-quick scheme because it really depends on your business model. But you might be an affiliate for a product that is \'a35. You might be an affiliate for something which is \'a35,000 and depending on the share that you get, which is usually between one and 50 percent, you could be -- it could be a get-rich-quick scheme for you if you sign up to the -- my affiliate program, sure. But for most people, they are not be able to find a product that's aligned with their community which is a massively high top ticket product. And they also don't necessarily have the traffic in place or the community in place to come sell to quote unquote. So, it is something that builds up over time, but if you can put your strategy in place now, then that means that over the next few months and years, you will continue to be bringing in affiliate income and it will really nicely stack.\
\
[00:05:53.990] - Alex\
And whilst your business grows, your affiliate income will also grow. It's also not an all or nothing approach. So many people think that this means they need to go out and create a really niche website, build their traffic with SEO and sell really something really niche like having a running trainer comparison site. That is always like a really big example that seems to be on the Internet. And you, of course, can do that but I really love teaching people ways that they can bring in affiliate income into their existing business. So, this is not like a whole new project you have to start. We can look at ways that we can bring affiliate income into your business right now, and we can also think about how long term we can strategize to make sure affiliate income is part of your overall business strategy. It's also not sleazy. Of course, like absolutely anything in business affiliate marketing can be sleazy. People can sell in a sleazy way. People can market in a sleazy way. People can do literally anything in business in a sleazy way, and affiliate income is definitely, you know, can -- can be done sleazily. But I teach it in a way where you are completely honest with the disclaimers so people understand how you make your income that an affiliate link is involved.\
\
[00:07:04.810] - Alex\
You are not promoting just to promote just because you want that juicy, juicy 50 percent, you know, cut of the product. It's because you genuinely think this product or service will be able to support your clients or community to, you know, grow and expand in whatever way that you support them. So, in fact, affiliate income is a way to diversify your revenue which I'm a huge fan of. It really is the, I think, key for 2023 to diversify your revenue. After the last few years, we've seen with the pandemic, with the cost of living crisis, all of these things that are going on in the world, we -- the war in Ukraine, we can just see how these huge world events can really shake us and shake our businesses. So, it's important that we diversify our revenue streams so that if anything happens, if we need to take time off unexpectedly or expectedly, that our business is still ticking along nicely and bringing in income. We also -- it's also a great way to make money for products or services that you're already recommending. I know that as you go through your daily life, in your business, and in your -- in your personal life as well, you will be constantly recommending products or services.\
\
[00:08:12.460] - Alex\
Well, why not get a little kickback for those things you were already promoting? It's also a way to serve your audience so they get their best results. Like I mentioned earlier, if you are already offering a service to someone, for example, say you are a business coach and you support someone on how they can, you know, get to the next, you know, 5K of revenue in their month, so they're looking at how they can expand their client portfolio, for example, well there's various ways that they can do that, but maybe one way you're talking about is email marketing. Okay, great. So, they're going to need an email marketing service. Okay. Well, you have various options that's free to being super expensive. Which one do you recommend? Which one is the best one that would actually support your clients to get those results that you have promised? These are just a few easy ways you can kind of see how affiliate marketing is actually beneficial for your audience as well. I also really love the example of I promote various different programs to my one-to-one clients in my business, strategy business, and that's because I know I am not the best at everything. I am not the best at creating courses, so I have someone who I recommend who I get a cut of if the successful recommendations.\
\
[00:09:27.980] - Alex\
I have an SEO course that I recommend because even though I'm pretty damn good at SEO the technical side of SEO I find difficult to teach. So, I'm going to send you to the best person, and that is when I really think that we create the best client experiences because we're happy to say, actually, there's someone who does this better than me. The online space feels like it's a bit cannibalized. I feel like we're all just stepping on each other's toes trying to expand our product suite to the point of where we're really just covering anything and everything to try and reach everyone. Whereas actually, when you're really bloody good at what you do, you are not scared to pass on the baton and say, actually, this person will be really good and really support you with this. And the way that we can do that with absolute ease and certainty and in a state of complete relaxation is if we are making affiliate income from those recommendations. So, to put it really simply, affiliate marketing is a marketing scheme in which a company compensates partners for business created from the affiliate's marketing tactic. So, just to put it simply, really is businesses, from small businesses like myself, which is really just a company of one with some freelancers -- I have an affiliate scheme.\
\
[00:10:35.640] - Alex\
Then we have companies like Amazon, you know, one of the biggest companies in the world also have an affiliate scheme. So it really does go from the smallest businesses to the biggest businesses often have affiliate schemes and this is just a way for them to reach more people. They know that if they get -- if they offer an affiliate scheme, people are more willing to promote their item, product, service, whatever it is. And it's just a really, really great way to kind of, like I said, pass on the baton to the right person so that people can really get the results that they're looking for. If you're someone who doesn't -- who's thinking, how the hell am I going to be able to promote a course or a service it doesn't make sense in my business, for example, let's think about a dog groomer. So you might not necessarily be promoting a course or a service. I mean, one thing you could recommend is you could team up with a behavioral expert who would -- who's a dog trainer, you know something like that, and you could get commission if you refer people on. But in terms of products as well, it's things like you can recommend dog grooming brushes. You can recommend different types of food if their coats' looking a bit dry, you know, all of these different things.\
\
[00:11:40.960] - Alex\
We're just kind of thinking outside the box and realizing how much in our everyday life we do actually recommend. So to put it simply, you really just receive a financial reward between one and 50 percent of the product or service price if someone purchases a product using your unique link. And this is what's key because the way that affiliate marketing works is that you will receive a unique URL which is linked back to you. And when someone clicks that link and buys through it in a certain amount of time, so for Amazon it's only 24 hours, but other affiliate schemes I've been in it's maybe 90 days, 30 days, six months it really depends and you'll see it as you apply to different programs, if someone buys within that time, then you will be credited and they will give you your cut, your percentage. It really is that simple. This is a question I get all the time. So who can actually do affiliate marketing? And the short answer truly is anyone who has a business, whether you're a blogger, a service provider, a coach, an influencer, a content creator, if you have any form of community or you're building a community via social media, a podcast, an email list, or if you have decent website traffic, you can invite affiliate income into your business, and it's really, really exciting.\
\
[00:12:59.140] - Alex\
When we get started into our kind of affiliate marketing strategy, my three-step framework, I just want to go through three mistakes that you might be making with your affiliate marketing if you've already started, or three things that you will want to avoid. The first one, of course, is not being compliant, and this is something that I see all the time. If you are not putting a disclaimer that something is an affiliate link anywhere and everywhere, whether you're sending, you know, product recommendation via email -- via, via email, you know like a mass email, like an email newsletter, on Instagram stories, in Instagram DMs, in blog posts, et cetera, et cetera, you have to be compliant. Certain affiliate schemes will have their own way of wording that they will want you to follow. But for the majority, it's just being really, really clear with your disclaimer saying, just so you know, this is an affiliate link. This means that you will -- that I receive a small amount of commission if you do purchase through my link with -- at no extra cost to you. I think that part is really key because I think people, if they are not familiar with affiliate marketing, might see that and think that you are charging a premium to go through your link, but you are not.\
\
[00:14:08.340] - Alex\
You are just getting a small commission if they decide to go through your link. Setting and forgetting is another key mistake of affiliate marketing. Like with any marketing strategy, it only really works if you are tracking the metrics, seeing what's working, making adjustments accordingly, and you know, seeing what works and seeing what doesn't work. To put it completely simply, is just to see what works. See what doesn't work. Make changes. Test it. Work through kind of those motions again and again, month on month, year on year, see what works, and It can be just an amazing way to bring in extra revenue into your business. But also, so many people just put it in, forget about it, lose their links, lose their login codes, don't know what's going on, make a few pennies, and just think this isn't working for me. There is a strategy that we can follow here. This isn't just a set and forget thing to do. Even though affiliate marketing is really easy, and once you have grasped it, it can be something that really does make you money while you sleep, while you're on holiday, et cetera, et cetera. We do need to have a strategy in place, like with anything in business.\
\
[00:15:10.340] - Alex\
And the final mistake you might be making or want to avoid is being inauthentic. So it can feel kind of exciting and thinking, okay, well this affiliate scheme pays 50 percent so I really want to promote this. But is it relevant to your audience? Is it something that you've actually used or would use? Because that's another thing [inaudible 00:15:28]. In our -- my nutrition business, I will recommend a supplement that I wouldn't necessarily take because it's not relevant to me. I write content about the people who are pregnant, for example. Well, I'm not pregnant. I've never been pregnant, so I wouldn't necessarily take those supplements. But I have done my research and I understand the product and I align with the business, et cetera, et cetera, and that's what this aligned affiliate marketing strategy is all about. It is not a get-rich-quick scheme. It's not a you know, sleazy way to do business. It really is adding an exciting, amazing, new revenue stream to your business in an aligned way that it makes sense for you and makes sense for your customers. So, how do you actually find these aligned affiliate opportunities? So this our step one in our three-step framework. So affiliate marketing can be sleazy like anything in business.\
\
[00:16:16.890] - Alex\
So like I've said, always recommend products you've used yourself or would use. Do your research and disclose. When we lead with value, our affiliate links should be secondary. So, it's not necessarily like we're going in and we're just thinking, okay, how can I get this affiliate link in and I will shoehorn it into anywhere, even if it doesn't fit. All of our content should be leading with value. If you are someone who creates articles for your website, you will already know that if you lead with value, Google rewards you. They want to put the people who are creating the absolute best content online at the top of their Google search. Instagram it's exactly the same thing. Tiktok, what is leading with value? What is entertaining? What is educational? What's informative for your audience? Lead with that and then affiliate links can come secondary. Always lead with them -- value, sorry, and never just because you like the look of the commission. So, there's one way to kind of think about this is to start by thinking what products or services are you already recommending. If you're someone who helps people create courses, you might be thinking, well, I recommend Teachable and Kajabi, so I'm going to go in and see if they have an affiliate program.\
\
[00:17:23.200] - Alex\
Hint, they both do. What recommendations do people ask from you? So someone might be saying, if you're a dog groomer, well what [inaudible 00:17:30] you're using so that I could do this in between sessions? There you go. There's one thing that you can already do. What products or services would complement the work you already do? So this is similar to the example I was using before. Let me do a different one. So say, for example, you are a personal trainer and you know that people come in and you are not qualified to do sports massage -- we know some people come in complaining that they've got some niggles. Could you join up with a physiotherapist or a sports masseuse and promote their products? You know, these are all ways that we can go about this. Could you look at foam rollers? Could you look at, you know, those massage guns? You know, there's so many different ways that we can think about this. And it's just taking some time and maybe getting a big piece of paper or getting a Notion board going, and just brainstorming all of those different things that you already recommend in your business, what people ask from you, and what would complement your work.\
\
[00:18:22.110] - Alex\
And the really overarching thing here is what products or services would help your ideal client save time, save money, and/or achieve their goals, and you can kind of cross out what's not relevant here to you and your business. But for most people, their aim really for anything they're purchasing is because they want to either save time, save money, or achieve their goals, or it might be a combination. So just go back to that and that can be kind of your north star. What is going on here? What would actually help my client? And then we have different types of affiliate programs that you can join. So, I split it into three because I really do think Amazon Associates is its own beast. It's almost like a marketplace because of the way that Amazon does that business and how they run their business. They are such a huge marketplace that sells products from them via Amazon and also via individual businesses. So, Amazon Associates is a huge one, but their affiliates is incredibly low and also you might not feel aligned to Amazon and their way of doing business, so this might not be suitable for you. We also have affiliate networks. So this is more for businesses that you may think of like ASOS, M&S, John Lewis, those sort of businesses, H&M, they have -- they all kind of partner with these affiliate networks and you can join them.\
\
[00:19:35.890] - Alex\
Well, you often just going to have to say who you are, what you do, pop in like your website or your Instagram and show how you are going to actually promote the product. And you are likely to kind of go through a little bit of like a validation phase where they will just check you out and just make sure that you are not going against any of their guidelines like promoting violence or something like that. So there's a little bit of work to be done there, but it's not too difficult and they are generally quite generous with who they accept. And we also have direct, so this might be something like the example I've put here is Kajabi. But this tends to be kind of standalone smaller businesses and not necessarily small businesses but kind of smaller. A lot of the tech platforms do it this way where they have their own affiliate program. Or another good example is like supplement companies often have their own, and then the bigger supplement companies are usually within the affiliate networks. So, you just might have to kind of like route around. But usually if you just go to someone's website for a product that you want to promote or a service you want to promote and scroll down to the bottom, they usually do have a section on their affiliate program and you can figure out how they -- how they do their program\
\
[00:20:39.550] - Alex\
is it via a network or is it direct. And you can also pitch to businesses that don't have affiliate schemes. I'm not going to go into that today because that is a much more in-depth way of doing things, but that is definitely possible. So it's really exciting because there are so many different ways that you can become an affiliate for businesses and companies that you love. And now, we are signed up. We have our code. So when you have signed up to somewhere you've been approved, you will be given unique URLs which are linked via cookies to you and your website. So they're aligned with you, and you are able to start placing them. So I like to split affiliate marketing into two different buckets. So, we have our primary affiliates and we have our secondary affiliates. And for me, primary affiliates' articles tend to convert extremely well, and this is because the consumer is at the end of their buying journey. This is really when the article, the piece of content, the video, the podcast, literally whatever it is, is completely focused on that affiliate product. So, if we go back to the business owner who helps people create courses, this might be a PDF that says, Kajabi versus Teachable, which should you use?\
\
[00:21:54.130] - Alex\
And it's like the pros, the cons, the cost, you know, everything is on there, and then it has the two affiliate links so people can make their decision. So, this works really well for reviews versus content, like I mentioned case studies saying in my experience using Flodesk or my experience with this type of supplement, whatever it is. You can also do interviews. So maybe you might interview the founder of a company, or you might do an interview with someone who's also used that product or service. That can be a really great way to create primary affiliate content. It might be how-to guides or training videos where you kind of coach someone through how they actually use a service or a product. It might be mini reviews on social media. Another way that it converts really well is a sales page. So, for example, if you know that there is a product that you -- a product or service that you just absolutely love, you're recommending all the time, you are really going to be using as your kind of -- as a primary way of creating income, then a sales page can work really well. So you might actually create a sales page as if it's your product, obviously saying that it's not your product, it's an affiliate link but creating a whole sales page.\
\
[00:23:00.890] - Alex\
Secondary affiliate marketing is really things like when you kind of weave the affiliate's links into content you would already be creating, for example, articles for your SEO for people to find you online, resources pages. So resource page is something like all the tools I use in my business onboarding and offboarding documents for new clients within courses, within PDFs and e-books, and another FAQ on a sales page, listicles, roundups, gift buys, thank you pages, and then just like in conversations like on Instagram DM or on Zoom, or in person, you know, just having those conversations with people. Okay. And then we have stage three, and this is really what I was talking about earlier when I was saying about not setting and forgetting. This is how we track and optimize our affiliate marketing so that it actually fits in really well with our business. It's actually making sense for the time we're putting in, and we can see what's working and what's not, and we can make adjustments accordingly. So track. We want to curate an affiliate marketing tracker which I give you free if you join my course. We also have an up -- you need to update that metrics tracker on a monthly basis and audit any broken links.\
\
[00:24:06.330] - Alex\
I actually had this happen to me recently when a affiliate program changed the way that they were doing links and I didn't realize and all of my links were broken for about three weeks, and I should have noticed because it was one of my bigger affiliate products. But then I ended up discovering it and I audited it and I changed the links and I fixed it. But it was one of those things where I have definitely lost income from just not being aware of broken links. So, using a broken link checker is really great for that. You also want to be tracking to keep aware of new programs that you can join because ideally we do want to be off Amazon for various reasons. But one of the main things is just the affiliate commission that it gives is just not very high. It's not very competitive. So if, for example, a product that we usually put on Amazon, they decide to create their own affiliate program, then we can go directly there instead which can be great. And then from this we can optimize. We identify the issue. Why is this not working? So it might be something as simple as, oh the link is broken, you know, something like that -- that happened to me.\

But also sometimes you'll just create something maybe a primary piece of content or a secondary piece of content that's just not working quite so well. So, let's optimize it. Let's see what's going wrong. And we can identify the issue and it's usually three things. Is there low traffic? Is there not enough people finding that piece of content? Whether it's a podcast, an article, a YouTube video, whatever it is, is it a low click-through rate? Are people reading the piece of content but not clicking through to find out more? What's the problem there? Or is it a low conversion rate? People are clicking through but they are not converting. Once we have seen what the problem is, once we've identified the issue, then we can take some time to optimize. Thank you so much for watching this training.

A little bit about me, my name is Amira Irfan. I am the business lawyer, entrepreneur, and coach over at aselfguru.com. I have been known to help entrepreneurs legally protect their businesses. I've been doing that for a decade now.\
\
Amira Irfan [00:00:47]:\
I've helped thousands of entrepreneurs legally protect their businesses with my either my legal templates or working with me 1 on 1, and this is me also on TV talking about legal protection, the 5 things businesses, need to know to stay safe. Although I talk about legal protection a lot, but today's training is very exciting because I'm talking about affiliate marketing and how to make money from affiliate marketing for beginners. And, honestly, when I started my blogging online business years ago, this was one of the very first ways that I made my $100, and it was so exciting. So today, I make thousands of dollars from affiliate marketing. One of my months, recently, I had $20,000 from just affiliate marketing alone. So these are tips and tricks that, trust me, you definitely wanna pay attention to. And I can't wait for you to also start making money from affiliate marketing like a pro. Now before we get started, my one simple, humble request is for you to turn off your phone, close your tabs on the computer so that you're fully engaged.\
\
Amira Irfan [00:01:48]:\
Let's get rid of those distractions because I really want this training to be worthwhile for you, and the best way to do that is to engage with me. So don't make me feel like all alone here. Comment, ask questions so that I can address your struggles and give you solutions. And, also, let me know, like, in the comments, like, where are you in your affiliate marketing journey? Like, have you made any money? Have you signed up for any programs? Like, what are you struggling with? Alright. So what will you learn today? We have a lot to cover. 1st, we're gonna go right into what's affiliate marketing, like how you can be an affiliate and how you can even offer your own affiliate program to others. Then we're gonna talk about how to get started. Like, what are the 5 most important things that you have to remember or look for? And then what plug in that you can use to make your affiliate links look pretty? This is the plug in that I've been using for years.\
\
Amira Irfan [00:02:43]:\
Then some of the affiliate marketing rules that you absolutely need to know. These are the Federal Trade Commission disclosure requirements that you need to know legally in order to stay compliant, avoid any fines and lawsuits. I'm actually gonna give you the exact language that I usually only share in my paid disclaimer template that bloggers and entrepreneurs buy, but I'm gonna give it to you for free here because I really want you to be in compliance. And I'm also gonna tell you the 4 most important things that you need to know. Then another question that comes up often in my Facebook group is, when do I need my own affiliate program, like agreement? Right? These are also known as affiliate terms and conditions. When you sign up for an affiliate program, you will look for those terms, but there will be a time if you offer your own program. You're gonna also need to have an affiliate agreement of your own. So we're gonna address those situations.\
\
Amira Irfan [00:03:36]:\
Then top 7 affiliate program networks that you can join in your niche, and then 5 ways to make money online with your links. Now these are the special unique, you know, ideas and tips and tricks, and I'm also gonna share my experiences and examples so that you can succeed with affiliate marketing and also start making thousands of dollars. Now my legal disclaimer, because I'm a lawyer, I will be sharing some legal tips in here as well, such as affiliate disclosures and tips that you need to know. But please know that I'm not your lawyer. This training is strictly for your educational purposes. It's for informational purposes only. It's not legal advice or even business advice.\
\
Amira Irfan [00:04:11]:\
So let's get right into it. What exactly is affiliate marketing? Affiliate marketing in very simple terms is when you recommend a different product, which is not yours, like somebody else's product or service, and then you earn a commission if somebody else's product or service, and then you earn a commission if somebody else purchases through your link. So a good example is, let's say, I am recommending a business tool and then you end up clicking on my affiliate link and buying through my link that business tool, that I'm going to earn an, an affiliate commission. Another example is beauty influencers that you see on Instagram or in videos recommending makeup products. Right? Amazon products, food bloggers recommending cooking products, utensils. So these are just all different ways that you could sign up in different niches and, make money blogging. Any questions so far? Alright.\
\
Amira Irfan [00:05:09]:\
So how do you get started? When you wanna promote a product or service as an affiliate, you have to first apply to join in their affiliate program. So let's actually go through an example. So here's an example of Wordfence. Right? So let's say I want to join their program. So you just go to workfence.com, and then you scroll down. In this case, sometimes it's at the top, sometimes at the bottom. But, you know, you look at the the header footer menu, and then you go right here. I went to their affiliate program page.\
\
Amira Irfan [00:05:40]:\
And let's say I wanna sign up as an affiliate. So, obviously, I will I would wanna read all of this great stuff because I wanna know, like, how I can promote, what the product is, if it's a good fit for my audience. And let's say I'm already using Wordfence, and now I just wanna recommend it because I love it. So, again, look at their frequently asked questions, and then I go ahead and proceed with the application process. The application, usually speaking, after being part of hundreds of affiliate programs myself, it's very much the same stuff. Like, they will ask you your name, your email. You're you're gonna have to create an account, so your password, your company information, your website link. And then most likely, they wanna know, like, how are you gonna promote? So they will ask you to, like, provide that info.\
\
Amira Irfan [00:06:24]:\
Usually, a lot of affiliate programs pay by PayPal, so they would want your PayPal info here, your social media channels just to kinda get an idea if you're a good fit for them. But every application is different. Okay? So this is just like, generally speaking, that's the case, and then you sign up and then you wait. Okay? So sometimes it's a week, sometimes it's right away, sometimes it takes time. So every affiliate program, the key to remember is that they get to set their own rules. Okay? That's really important, and that's just how every company gets to do their affiliate marketing. Another question I get is, like, what do I look for when I'm signing up as an affiliate? So we touched upon some of those things, but let's go a little bit deeper. There are 5 things that you have to really pay attention to.\
\
Amira Irfan [00:07:12]:\
Okay? Number 1, what's the affiliate commission? This varies from program to pro program. Sometimes it's only 10%. Sometimes it's 50%. Sometimes it's 30%. It just depends on the actual owner of the owner of the program, whatever that percentage looks like. Then sometimes it's not even a percentage. It's just an actual amount. Like, it could be $50 per sale, $100 per sale.\
\
Amira Irfan [00:07:32]:\
I'm part of a program that that literally gives me $100 per per sign up, right, per sale. So it all varies. Sometimes it's reoccurring where you receive a percentage of the sale every month as long as the person that you refer to remains their customer. So I'll give you another example. There's a business tool that I absolutely love, Kartra. I've been using it for years, and I recommend it, and it offers me reoccurring commission monthly. So let's say you sign up for that tool through my link. Then every month for as long as you stay on with them, I'm also gonna receive a percentage of that, whatever that may be, like 10%, 20%.\
\
Amira Irfan [00:08:13]:\
It all varies. So that's what you wanna look for. What's that commission look like? The next thing you wanna pay attention to is what's the cookie period. Now what exactly is a cookie? A cookie is like the way affiliate purchases are tracked on the device that somebody clicked on. So, for example, if I am clicking right now from my computer, then there's automatically a cookie is gonna be placed onto my computer if I am going to click on your affiliate link. And that cookie period could be 30 days, 120 days, 90 days, 60 days. Again, this also varies depending on the program. I have been part of a program that actually had a whole year cookie period.\
\
Amira Irfan [00:08:55]:\
I've been part of a program that only has 30 day cookie period. Amazon is one of them, which has got the smallest cookie period, like, I think, 24 hours. So every program is very, very different. Again, you have to look for that cookie period. And another thing to keep in mind about the cookie period is that, let's say that I click on your affiliate link and the cookie period is 30 days. Within that 30 days, if I don't buy, then and I buy after the 40th 40th day, then you're not gonna gain the commission even though initially I was introduced to that product through your link. So because the cookie has expired. Or what another situation, let's say I go and I click on your link, and then there's a 30 day window.\
\
Amira Irfan [00:09:37]:\
And within those 30 days, I end up clicking on somebody else's affiliate link for the same product and ended up buying from that link, meaning whichever click was the last click, that gets recorded. It's unfortunate. You might be the first one to introduce me to that product, but then I end up clicking on somebody else's review to read more about the product and buying from that link, then that person will gain the commission, not you. How will you get paid is another very important thing to keep in mind because this also varies, depending on the program. Some people pay, 30 days after the sale. Sometimes there's a hold of 60 days. I've even had a hold of 90 days. It just you have to read the terms to know when you're gonna get paid.\
\
Amira Irfan [00:10:21]:\
In my case, there's definitely a hold of 30 days in our affiliate program, but, again, every company is different. The next thing you wanna pay attention to is the company rules, their affiliate terms and conditions to see how you can promote. Sometimes they're very special requirements. Like in Amazon's case, you are required to give in a special special language that you have to post on your site. You cannot share their links freely in your products, digital products. So you need to make sure to review those terms so that you don't violate them and get kicked out. I'll give you another example. I was part of when I was a new blogger, I was part of a program that did not want any kind of promotion on Pinterest, meaning they didn't want their affiliate links to be shared on Pinterest at all.\
\
Amira Irfan [00:11:05]:\
I could not make any pins to the affiliate product. I couldn't even share the product on Pinterest and other places, and I could only use very specific images that they had given me. I couldn't even create my own images of the product or anything like that. So keep that in mind too. Sometimes you have very specific assets that they provide you, very specific disclosure language, such as in the case of Amazon. So there will be these nuances that, again, every program is different. You're just gonna have to look for those things. That's why I'm giving you this checklist.\
\
Amira Irfan [00:11:36]:\
So that way, you can refer back to this when you're signing up and you're like, okay. These are the points that I definitely need to pay attention. The next thing to keep in mind is that quality is more important than quantity. Don't go sign up for 100 of affiliate products right away. And next thing you know, you're overwhelmed. Your audience doesn't trust you. Your business reputation is everything. Alright? So be careful promoting, recommending products that you've never used before.\
\
Amira Irfan [00:12:03]:\
The ideal and the best case scenario, and I'm giving giving you my example, is I recommend products that I've actually personally used, invested in, spent the time to learn, right, that have really made a difference in my business, those are the ones that, to be honest, result in affiliate sales because people relate to people. So when I am writing a review of, like, hey. This blogging course made me earn my first $20,000 month or $30,000 month, then that's the product that people also, whoever is looking to start a blog, is gonna wanna know. Right? Because they're in the same shoes as me. They have the same pain points. So they wanna learn about my experience with this product, and I'm putting myself on the line, and it's my reputation. So, obviously, be careful, sharing that, and people relate to those stories. Right? So if I can share my experience and help somebody, then that's kind of mentality or approach that you wanna have with affiliate products.\
\
Amira Irfan [00:12:58]:\
Think about, like, the products or services that you've used, that you love, that you can, without any reservation, recommend based on your experience. And you'll be helping someone because if you went through a struggle or pain and then that product solved that pain for you, then chances are it's gonna help somebody else in your situation as well. So that's what I do. So my favorite, honestly, products as an affiliate are the ones that I've personally invested in. I've even recommendations page on my website where you can literally see all my investments and all the different, products and tools and things that I've invested in over the years to grow my business online, and those end up becoming my best affiliate income sources. Because, again, there's a story with them. People can see my before, my after, and that is kinda how you wanna approach affiliate products as well. Another pro tip to keep in mind is that you could always offer a special bonus of your own as an added incentive for others to purchase from your link versus others.\
\
Amira Irfan [00:14:00]:\
So remember I gave you that example that I could go and click on your affiliate link, but within the cookie period, then I go and click on somebody else's review of that product, and then the second person that I clicked on will get the commission, not you. But how do we avoid that? We can easily avoid that by giving a special bonus, something extra to the to me. You could be like, hey, Amira. If you buy from my link within this time period, then you're going to get this special bonus or this special course or this special product from me or training or anything. And that might be that added incentive that I need to get it from your link versus somebody else's. So that's just another way for you to increase your affiliate commissions. And this honestly works really well. I've used this tactic all the time to make money.\
\
Amira Irfan [00:14:49]:\
Alright. So the next thing is, what plug in can we use to make affiliate links look pretty? Because if you've ever signed up for an affiliate link or product, then you will know that it's usually this long, ugly looking link like this. This is actually really my affiliate link for Wordfence, to give you an example. So that's just how it it's gonna look. Imagine sharing that on Facebook or Instagram or even on your website. It's kinda like very ugly and long and not easy to remember. So how can we make it look short and pretty? So what what I recommend is this pretty link links plugin in WordPress. Simply search for it.\
\
Amira Irfan [00:15:25]:\
It's free. And then you can easily change that link to this. So you see how now it's, like, easy to remember for me to track, and it's, like, pretty as well because it's like my website domain, and it just looks more official. And the good thing about using this plugin is that tomorrow, I've and I've had this happen a lot. People change the companies that they use for their affiliate links tracking. If they change programs, then this link will no longer work. And imagine if I had, let's say, 30 blog posts where I had shared this link, and now all of a sudden this link is not valid anymore because now there's a new program that they want me to join, then imagine going back, manually and changing that link. It's gonna be so cumbersome.\
\
Amira Irfan [00:16:08]:\
But when you use a plug in, then all you gotta do is just update the link in the plug in, and it automatically gets updated everywhere on your site. So that's really, really easy and something to keep in mind. Any questions so far? Alright. So a common question I also get is how do I write an affiliate disclosure to comply with the Federal Trade Commission rules? Because I remember I mentioned in the beginning that I'm gonna give you the exact language. So here it is. Let's start taking notes. Under the Federal Trade Commission, by the way, that's the agency that regulates privacy, that also regulates transparency with consumers. So what happens is that it is responsible for making sure that people are sharing affiliate links with transparency, and it has rules and regulations to ensure fair and ethical practices in the US and beyond.\
\
Amira Irfan [00:17:00]:\
Right? So this agency, if you don't comply with those rules, just remember that I have personally seen, influencers and bloggers getting audited. They have even gotten fined, and they've even the result they've even been sued. So you definitely wanna pay attention to those rules and do not take this lightly. And this is the language that an example that you can use. So let's say that I was writing a blog post. I would write this blog post, or let's say I was sharing an affiliate link in a course or maybe in an email. Just make sure to insert that here. This email, this blog post, or this course may contain affiliate links, which means that I will earn a small commission if you purchase through my link.\
\
Amira Irfan [00:17:41]:\
Please see full disclosure for more information. And then you have to link this full disclosure to your actual disclaimer or disclosure policy on your website. This is very important. Don't just say, a mistake I see is, like, people just say, oh, this is an affiliate link. Not everybody knows what's an affiliate link. You need to spell it out and say that I will earn a small commission if you purchase through my link. So this language is needed. And then sometimes people will stop there, and they won't even give you the full disclosure page, the link.\
\
Amira Irfan [00:18:11]:\
You need to give that as well. So keep this as keep this in mind, and I'm also gonna show you an example on my website in a bit so that you can get a better idea. So this is directly from my website. Right? And let me also show you how it looks. But this is kind of what you have to do. You have to write this post contains affiliate links, and let me show you on my website. So here's my website. Right? And here's a blog post.\
\
Amira Irfan [00:18:35]:\
I'm talking about legal pages here, but you see this is the language. This is the affiliate disclosure language right here. And then when we click here to the full disclosure, now it's gonna take you to my actual disclaimer page on my website. This is the full disclosure disclaimer policy. I call it disclaimer because my disclosure policy is already built into this template. That's just something to keep in mind that you do have to show and you have to write that, before you start sharing your affiliate link. So going back to my example here. So the key that you have to keep in mind is that you have to use clear and conspicuous language.\
\
Amira Irfan [00:19:15]:\
So do not hide the fact that it's an affiliate link. Okay? Make it extremely clear. Place the disclosure before the affiliate link, not on the sidebar. So not like, not like on the sidebar like here. This is not good enough. Make it, like, right before you actually start sharing the, the link. Okay? At the top is ideal. Then you also need to give the disclosure, even when it's in a sponsored post or even a free product that you receive.\
\
Amira Irfan [00:19:43]:\
That's a different language altogether. But because today we're talking about affiliate links, so I gave you that language. You also need to disclose on all platforms, like your website, your email, your digital products, your social media, like Facebook, Instagram, things like that. Okay? The next thing you have to keep in mind is, like, when do you need an affiliate agreement? Right? This is another question that comes up. Whenever you're gonna offer your own affiliate program to others to join to earn a commission from your own product, that's when you need an affiliate agreement. Affiliate agreement are like your rules of your affiliate program. Remember all those things we talked about, the cookie period, the compensation, how you can promote? Now you get to decide all of those things. You get to decide, like, well, how much commission you're gonna pay.\
\
Amira Irfan [00:20:32]:\
You get to decide when you're gonna pay, how you're gonna pay. All of those are your rules. So that way, you and your affiliates are on the same page. And now also remember, you have a legal obligation to ensure compliance with the Federal Trade Commission rules, and you need to put that, obligation on your affiliate. So you put all of those things in your affiliate agreement and then make sure that your affiliates are accepting those terms before they start promoting and sharing your products. Now the next question is, like, what are the top affiliate network programs that we can join to make money from home? So this is another one of those slides that you wanna screenshot or take notes on. The number 1 or the easiest one that people usually join at the very beginning is Amazon, but doesn't mean that Amazon is the most high paying or anything. Their commissions are usually very small, and over the years, they made changes.\
\
Amira Irfan [00:21:22]:\
So they're not necessarily, like, the best paying. But if you have a lot of articles ranking and, like, for example, best products or best cameras or best whatever, something like that, then Amazon products, you can easily link to them on in those website I mean, those blog posts, and then you will make those that income passively. The next one is ShareSale, then Awin, Impact, ClickBank, FlexOffers, Max Bounty, and any others in your niche. Do not be limited to just these. These are like one of those big networks that you can join. But speaking from experience, I also recommend definitely joining programs that you've invested in. Like, for example, let's say I bought a blogging course. I would always check to see if that course has an affiliate program.\
\
Amira Irfan [00:22:10]:\
If that if I love the course and I feel comfortable recommending, then I would wanna join that course that program owners, you know, the owner the course owners program. So that way I can share it with my audience and recover my investment. Just keep that in mind that there are so many others in your niche that you will find based on your, experience and how you, you know, how you invested in those programs, and that will become, like, one of the great ways for you to make money. Now the other thing is, what are the 5 ways that we can make money? Now the exciting part. Right? Number 1 and the easiest is honestly blog post. You can write a review article of the product. You can even share relevant affiliate links in your blog post naturally. Like, some examples are, like, best WordPress plug ins.\
\
Amira Irfan [00:22:58]:\
You could share, you know, a list of plug ins, and then you could be affiliate for those plug ins, and then you can easily just go down the list like a review post and share them. Another one is, like, best business blogging tools. I have a couple of blog posts about blogging tools, business tools, and they're my affiliate links. And I also talk about, like, how that tool helped me. What is that tool? What is it good for? Explain it to your audience so that they understand why they need it, if they need it. So these are just easy ways for you to, like, write those blog posts with, affiliate products. The next one is also really great, and this has worked really well for me over the years, is emails. You could send a series of emails educating your audience about your affiliate product that you're recommending, the problem that is solved, and the results that you got from it.\
\
Amira Irfan [00:23:50]:\
So this is more personal and impactful. So if it's like a hype, product, I'll give you an example. There was a blogging course that I took at the time, which was like $700, and now it's like $1,000 or something. So, obviously, it's not gonna just happen by just sharing it randomly. Right? Somebody gonna it's a it's a it's a little bit of a big ask, right, to spend $1,000. So in order for me to sell that, I have to share my story. I have to let people know in an email that how, why, first of all, I invested in this course, how it helped me, what are my results from it, do I recommend it, maybe what I liked, maybe what I didn't like so that I'm being honest and transparent. And those are the kind of emails or series of emails will result in a sale because somebody else could be in my shoes and they could be for of, you know, having the same problem and looking for a solution, and that course is going to be that solution.\
\
Amira Irfan [00:24:40]:\
So it's more personal. You can share stories and, make that recommendation. Now the next step is videos. So don't just stop with blog posts or emails. Take it a step further. I would advise to take your blog post. You've already written a nice blog post. Now turn it into a video.\
\
Amira Irfan [00:25:01]:\
Why don't you write a video review or a video tutorial of a product? You could be showing a tutorial of, like, the the tool that you're using. I have a video about Katra on my YouTube channel where I'm literally showing the inside of my dashboard. I'm showing you why I love that tool or how I've been using it for years. What are some of the ways that it's helped grow my business, scale my business? Again, you just wanna give the inside information because think about it. Like, when you go buy a product that is completely brand new, don't you look for reviews? Don't you look for testimonials? So you're doing the same thing for now your audience. Right? You're providing that testimonial. You're providing that review. And then you can share the product in your YouTube video description.\
\
Amira Irfan [00:25:45]:\
Just make sure to give that disclosure as we talked about earlier. You can also share on social media. Like, some of my students well, more like, customers, have told me that they've literally shared my legal templates affiliate link with another Facebook, friend of theirs or Instagram stories, and they've made money Without even writing a blog post, without doing any of this, again, it all comes down to where your audience is. And if you feel that you can just share on social media, like write a post or write, you know, like a helpful description or anything, you will make money through that way too. So social media is definitely a great way. The next one that you may not have thought about are your own products. Like, if you have ebooks, maybe you have a course, maybe you have a webinar, maybe you have a live training, maybe you have a PDF guide or anything. Just make sure to also share affiliate links in them.\
\
Amira Irfan [00:26:44]:\
Sometimes we are so focused on our own product that we don't even think about anybody else's product recommendations, but, you can. You know, you can definitely even offer a special discount, once again, a bonus. You can even negotiate a deal with, for your audience. Like, I've I've done this over the years, like, where I have, collaborated with another entrepreneur and I've said, hey. I would love to promote your product to my, customers. Can you give me a special discount for my audience? Maybe 20%, 10%, something like that. So then I will share that. And that also helps with affiliate sales because people are looking for that bonus.\
\
Amira Irfan [00:27:23]:\
They're looking for that discount. And that's another way that you could distinguish yourself from all the other people that are sharing that product. So keep those tips and tricks in mind. Those are great ways for you to make money from affiliate marketing. So another question I get is, can you make $100 or even $10,000 a month from affiliate marketing? Absolutely. I have made more than $20,000 a month from just affiliate marketing. It can be done. You just need to have all these strategies in place.\
\

Execute on even 1 or 2 tips that we discussed, but do it consistently, and you will start making money. Now as a recap, here are the 5 steps to succeed with affiliate marketing. 1st, you need to research. You need to understand the products that you're gonna promote. The best ones are the ones that you've already used. Start there. Pick 1 or 2 or 5, and then join the program. Once you sign up, make sure to understand their terms and conditions, how you can promote, what's the cookie period, when you're gonna get paid, things like that.\
\
Amira Irfan [00:28:24]:\
Then you start creating content for that product. Could be a review article. It could be a video. It could be a social media post. You need to think outside the box and start doing that. Then you need to promote it. It's not enough to just share it. Like, you know, share it organically within your content.\
\
Amira Irfan [00:28:43]:\
Don't just write one blog post. Share look at your whole calendar. Look at your whole blog post planner and be like, okay. Maybe I have 5 blog posts about talking about business tools. Can I include all of these in on all 5 of them? Yes. The more you share, the more likelihood of somebody clicking on that link and buying through your link. So sometimes people make the mistake like, oh, I just wrote a blog post, but I'm not getting any sales. Well, you only shared it once.\
\
Amira Irfan [00:29:09]:\
You have to share multiple times for people to take you seriously and also for, people to be able to see that content different ways. Right? Then you analyze. Look at the analytics performance and then adjust your approach accordingly. So these are just some of the things. Now let's talk about the action steps because all of this sounds really great, but what are you gonna do next? So first thing is, like, make sure to take about, like, 5 to 10 affiliate programs in your niche. Pick them. Go through those networks that we talked about. Join 1 or 2 of them.\
\
Amira Irfan [00:29:42]:\
Start going through the the affiliate programs in that network. They got they got it many of different ones divided by niche, and then join them. Alright? And then if you're gonna offer your own product for your product or services, your own affiliate program, then make sure to use an affiliate agreement to outline those rules. Then you also know the 5 important things that you gotta look for when you're joining the program or offering your own. Make sure to follow the affiliate disclosure rules. We talked about the language I gave you. Then the top 5 different ways that you can use, your affiliate links to make money. The plug in, I recommend you start using the plug in for day from day 1 instead of the long, ugly affiliate link because it just makes the process a lot more easier and clean and nice looking.\
\
Amira Irfan [00:30:28]:\
The next thing is that you also need to know what are disclaimers and disclosures. Like, what's the difference? People usually could get confused. And this is where I would love for you to sign up for my free legal guide. It's gonna walk you through the difference between disclosures. We talked about affiliate disclosures today, but you also need to give what are called disclaimers, and they're for a different purpose. Disclaimers are basically the language that you need to post on your site to prevent lawsuits, even lawsuits related to the affiliate programs that you're promoting. You need a disclaimer for that as well. So, obviously, I've got templates.\
\
Amira Irfan [00:31:04]:\
But before we even get to that, I think you should sign up for this free legal guide so you can understand the difference. You can understand how to avoid some of the common legal mistakes I see bloggers making, things that can get you audited, fined, and sued. We touched upon some of them here, but not everything. And then I also will guide you through what are some of the things that you have to watch out for to avoid legal disputes with your customers. Look. I watched my own Dad's business get sued for $90,000, which is why I became a lawyer. And so I'm very passionate about giving you a lot of valuable information so that I can guide you from making those costly legal mistakes. And just so you know, this legal guide is even trusted by fellow lawyers.\
\
Amira Irfan [00:31:45]:\
Like, here's an example of Katrina. She's a lawyer. She's also a customer of mine and has gotten this guide. So I definitely encourage you to click here and, go ahead and sign up for this guide. When you click here, it will take you to this page. And you simply scroll here, enter your name, your email, and then make sure to check your spam folder.

\
Amira Irfan [00:32:16]:\
And lastly, I really wanna say thank you so much for being with me here today. Pat yourself on the back because we covered a lot of stuff. Trust me. All of these things that I'm teaching you today or that I taught you took me years because I invested in so many courses and programs to learn all of this.

**Transcript:**\
[00:00:11.800] - Bree Boucher\
Well, hello there. Welcome to my presentation on monetizing your blog with bundles. So let's start off with a little bit of an explanation about what bundles are and why they work for bloggers. So you can actually see a little bit of a screenshot, a little bit of snippet of a bundle that I recently was a part of as a project manager and as a contributor. So I helped put this one together. This here is a collection page or a redemption page where you can access a whole bunch of different resources. So let me explain what that means in more detail now. So a bundle is not a freebie swap where people swap their email and freebies. It's not a giveaway with one prize winner, and it's also not just all of your products bundled together, which is generally what people think of when they hear someone say a bundle. It's your things together as a collection. Instead, a bundle is a collection of digital products from multiple contributors, each providing a broad selection of resources in the one bundle. So that could be things like workshops, courses, templates, Templates. This example that I've shown here is actually all Notion templates because that is the theme of this particular bundle.\
\
[00:01:37.320] - Bree Boucher\
It was designed around Notion, and so that's why everything has a Notion theme to it. So your audience and the audience that you are going to be borrowing can access this bundle for free or by paying with their money. So they either pay via opt-in through email, so they pay with their email, or they pay via actually paying money for the bundle. So I want you to think about a bundle. It's a lot like a buffet in that audience members can sign up for the buffet, and they go ahead and pick and choose from a variety of options, taking just the ones or the things that appeal to them most. So I'm I'm obviously showing you four different things you could select, but maybe not all of them are going to be relevant to your particular example here. So you're not always going to be needing everything in the buffet, but it's nice to know that there's a selection of options there for you. Okay, so how they work. A host organizes the bundle, and they do all of the work, which includes gathering contributors and overseeing the promotion and distribution of the bundle. Contributors join by providing their products and promoting their bundle to their own audiences.\
\
[00:03:09.340] - Bree Boucher\
Bundles, as I said before, can be free, paid, or a hybrid of both a free and a paid tier. It's like an upgrade. Why they are great for bloggers? So audience growth is obviously a key one here. Bundles allow bloggers to rapidly grow their email list by reaching a much larger audience when combined with all of the people that are participating and contributing in a bundle. There's also some revenue potential, and that can look like, obviously, the paid bundles. If you're a host of a paid bundle, you're going to be bringing in immediate income. Whereas with a free bundle, if you're a host or a contributor of that, then you are going to be bringing in more traffic and new leads into your ecosystem, and then that will longer term turn into paying clients and customers. You might even have some trip wires and some order bumps and ways to monetize from the very start as well. I wanted to give you an example from last year when I contributed to over 10 bundles in 90 days. My list grew by over a thousand people, many of whom are still engaged a year later. And I've also seen hosts trapped upwards of 2000 leads with just one single bundle.\
\
[00:04:30.740] - Bree Boucher\
Okay, so you're probably like, cool, that sounds exciting, but who the hell are you? Who am I talking? Who's talking to me right now? Hello, I am Bree. My name is Bree Boucher. I'm an introvert and INFJ. I am Australian. And I am a NLP, Clinical Hypnosis and EFT tapping Practitioner. I'm a certified coach, a strategist, and a mentor. So I'm an introvert visibility coach, and I work exclusively with introverted creatives, coaches, consultants to grow their visibility, community, and income through collaborations. I'm the host of a whole bunch of different communities, my bundles of bundles, Facebook group, the Collab Club over in school. Plus, I have my amazing membership, CollabBetter. And I'm the creator of the Innovative Bundle Flipbook method, which is just one of the many different types of bundle methods out there. So let's get into this again. You probably heard me say 2000 leads and you went, hello, how can I do this? I want to join. I want to do all the things. How do I get all those leads? So the first thing we need to do is figure out how ready you are to host a bundle. So there's a few things that I recommend you have, I guess, under your belt before you even consider hosting a bundle.\
\
[00:05:58.390] - Bree Boucher\
And here's a couple of them. So you want to have digital sales experience. So ideally, you've sold digital products before and you're comfortable with all of the systems that go with that. So I'm talking having workflows, automations, upsell as order bumps, those things I was talking about before, because that will help you make the most out of hosting the bundle. And obviously, if you're wanting to contribute as well, you're going to want to have those things in place too, right? So it's really important to to understand all of those back-end processes before you even consider managing a bundle yourself. I like to think that anyone that's hosted a bundle has actually contributed to a bundle in the past. So at least a handful, maybe three bundles that you've participated in. And that will give you some really great insight as to what works well and what doesn't. So as a contributor, you'll get behind the scenes glimpse of all of the things that happen when you are hosting a bundle. You obviously don't have to do all of the work, but you get to see the volume of copy that's written, the amount of communication backwards and forwards, all of that stuff you get to see.\
\
[00:07:18.500] - Bree Boucher\
And without having been part of a bundle at that level, you probably might think, oh, I'm sure it's going to be easy. What do I do? I just get some people together and that's it. I'm afraid to know you there's a lot more to it than just that. So as you can imagine, participating lets you learn from other's successes and allows you to be a stronger host as a result. Having things in place to track and pay affiliates, this is obviously more so for paid bundles. But I think it's also important to have those systems, like I was saying before. So software where that actually does the work for you. So having affiliate links and ways to capture that information is going to make a big difference when you are hosting. And even just if you're not even having a paid bundle, even just knowing that your contributors are doing their part in promoting, because you can see and track their use of the affiliate link as well, even if there's no cost to the end user for the bundle. So again, that goes back to software proficiency. So there's a lot of different tools that either you're going to need to get used to or learn that you haven't used before.\
\
[00:08:48.080] - Bree Boucher\
Things like Airtable may not be something you've used much, but it's probably the best way to actually coordinate and manage a bundle because there's a lot, again, of moving parts. You can use it for your project management, so like your to-do list. But you can also use it as a way to capture the contribution, information through forms and to coordinate all of that with the people that you're working with and just really just managing all of the logistics that goes on with that. With Airtable, you can send automations out, so you can actually send emails out based on particular statuses and things like that. So that's just one example. But there are other software and tools that you need to be across that maybe you haven't learnt before. Just being able to learn on the go or have a bit of a background in it already is really important. And then communication and collaboration skills. So you want to be able to really communicate well with others. You as the host are going to be leading a team of contributors to do the best they can to promote the bundle, right? So making sure that you're available to and have the capacity to keep up with frequent communication with your collaboration team is really, really important.\
\
[00:10:19.680] - Bree Boucher\
And if you don't think you can, you can also hire people to do that element for you as well. Whether it's a VA or a project manager, there's people out there that know how to manage these sorts of things, too. You want to have an audience for a promotion. So ideally, you already have a bit of a core audience to promote your bundle to, even if it's small. This is really important for bundle hosts that you do start at least with a little bit of a base, because as the host, you're doing the vast majority of the promotion, and then you're also borrowing the audiences of your contributors. So there needs to be a little bit of a base to start off with. And then the ball starts to get rolling because it's really important to get traffic to the page. And oftentimes You're sending maybe an email every day for the period that the bundle is promoted, but your contributors are only sending one or two emails. So we need to make sure that it's constantly in someone's radar because we're actually generating the traffic to the page and all of that stuff. So I think at least a little bit of an audience already.\
\
[00:11:40.720] - Bree Boucher\
Obviously, a bundle will grow your list. So I don't expect people to have thousands of people on their email list at this point. That's what a bundle can offer them. But having a core engaged audience to talk to will help and really increase the impact for your contributors as well. And then lastly, but not least, you want to have a good chunk of time in order to coordinate the bundle. So I suggest that a bundle when you're hosting is a 90 day commitment minimum. So it can take upwards of three months or more to plan, organize and execute a bundle. That includes some of the earlier planning stages and recruiting contributors But you can start some of the ideation and the recruitment months before you even actually get fully into the bundle. So there's a lot, as I said before, a lot goes into it. I don't want to scare you away from hosting, but I want you to know that it's not a tick and a flick and it's done thing. There's lots of bits and pieces that goes into it. So making sure that you have a good chunk of time. It's a solid the project that you'll be working on, like hours of your day will be, most weeks will be taken up with something to do with the bundle.\
\
[00:13:10.180] - Bree Boucher\
So making sure that you have time to plan and execute each stage so that you're not overwhelming yourself And again, you can hire people like myself who can support you in doing this. But if you're wanting to manage this yourself, giving yourself as much time and window to work on a project is always going to be a really great thing to do. So if hosting feels like a little bit of a future goal, that's totally fine. I don't think it's for everyone straight away. It might be something that you want to do down the track, but potentially you're actually more suited to contributing to a bundle first. So contributing could be your longer term goal instead of hosting. And that's totally fine. So start off with participating, like you said, and then really work up to becoming a host as you get more comfortable with the whole concept. I recommend to you listen to my Bundle Secrets podcast. There's a couple of episodes that will help you go a little bit deeper, knowing about whether you're ready to host and some do's and don'ts. Those two are really good episodes to look out for. And there's a few other really good episodes on there, of course, as well.\
\
[00:14:29.980] - Bree Boucher\
All right, let's talk a bit more about monetizing through participation versus creation. Okay, so you want to choose the best strategy for you. And as I said before, that could be participation, are you contributing to the bundles or hosting your own? So with participation, that is going to minimize the risk to you and it won't cost as much in terms of energy and finance experiences as well. But you'll still gain the exposure. And then hosting, you're going to be obviously maximizing the revenue potential and you're going to be building your authority and being out there and having your products being more visible as well. So monetising through participation can look like having a bundle, being in a bundle allows you to grow your list with minimal risk and investment. So basically, as I said before, you're borrowing someone's audience, you're borrowing the host's audience and the other contributors that are participating in the same bundle with you. So you do that to gain larger exposure. So obviously, people are going to find your product in the bundle, and then it's your job to nurture them and connect with them after the fact. So this is a low cost option with high reward.\
\
[00:16:01.200] - Bree Boucher\
So generally, participation is free. Occasionally, there is a fee associated, but oftentimes that is actually a sponsorship fee. So you can choose to sponsor a bundle to have a higher presence in the bundle. So in exchange, as I said earlier, you contribute a digital product or some description. You do your bit to promote the bundle, and then you get access to everyone that actually opts into your specific offer. So you don't actually get access to the entire list of people that opt into the bundle. You only have access to the people that select your thing, which is actually a really good thing to have because it means that your people that join your list are actually interested in what you're sharing and what you're selling and the thing that you're talking about the most. So really by joining someone else's bundle, it's the best way to dip your toes into collaborations more broadly. Bundles are like those earlier stage offers that you can consider being a part of in the collaboration space. It's low risk and it exposes your brand to a new and relevant audience. Whereas the other option, monetising through hosting, that can look like where you actually have the control over the content, like the theme of the bundle, like the example I showed before.\
\
[00:17:37.210] - Bree Boucher\
You could have a very specifically themed bundle that is talking to your topic, your niche, your expertise. You also have control over the people that you decide to collaborate with, the other contributors. You get to choose who is being a part of this collaboration. When you're contributing to other people's bundles, you don't have that control, obviously. You're just one of many, whereas in this instance, you decide who gets to be included in this bundle with you. It also obviously allows you to keep the largest share of the revenue. Even if you're hosting a paid bundle, you as the host will get the majority of the income and you ideally would have an affiliate commission that you pay your contributors when they sell their, a bundle through their affiliate link. But obviously, as the host, you get the majority and they get a portion. Okay, so the benefits of hosting a bundle is you have the revenue potential. So as I said before, paid bundles allow you as the host generate direct income from the bundle itself. And of course, you have the opportunity to generate income through order bumps, trip wires, upsells, those sorts of things that happen during the bundle promotion window.\
\
[00:19:15.020] - Bree Boucher\
And then obviously also the back-end offer, because I like to think of bundles as a lead-generating activity that then ultimately leads into the thing that you want to sell on the back-end. And so oftentimes Sometimes, that's one of the core things I teach, is knowing what you actually want to sell and then work backwards from there in order to decide on what your bundle is going to look like. So even free bundles can drive some significant traffic to your other products and services, especially if you're hosting your bundle on your website. So they're going to sign up for the bundle and take some time going through and redeeming offers on your website. But you can also then retarget. You can have ways to bring them back to certain pages on your site through pop-ups and other things like that. And later, like I said before, driving them to other products or services. Another really good benefit is your brand authority. So as the host, you become the connector in your industry, you're building authority and you're strengthening relationships. So not just You're building your authority to your audience or new audience around hosting, once you've hosted this particular topic or theme of your bundle.\
\
[00:20:41.970] - Bree Boucher\
But also you're connecting with more people in your niche and within your industry. And you are then seen as an authority within that space as well, because you've made those connections. You've been the go to person for that topic. So it helps outwardly and outwardly in terms of authority building. And the other thing to consider is there's a significant It's really an investment in planning that's required. So we need to remember that there is the up front planning. There might be some financial investment, whether it's having your VA work a little bit extra in that time frame to help support you with coordinating a bundle, hiring someone to host for you, or even just the fact that during the time that you're hosting a bundle, that could be a time where you are taking a step back from what you might have ordinarily spent that same amount of time on promoting a different product. And so there might be a loss in revenue in order for you to gain a good chunk of more people on your email list. It's one of those slingshot concepts where you're stepping back in order to slingshot forward. And that in itself could be something you need to consider as well.\
\
[00:22:16.690] - Bree Boucher\
The management of the collaboration can be quite energetically a huge investment, but the payoff can be substantial. So it It might be actually a good thing to consider. Hosting a bundle, I like to think of it as like your host of a party. So you send the invite, you coordinate everything, and you ensure everyone has a great experience. Plus, you get all of the present, ie, the leads, as a reward for your effort. Let's go with some practical tools for streamlining your collaborations. So if bundles are sounding good and you're thinking you're ready to host, here's tools that you will need to have access to in order to, I guess, do well. So Airtable is one, having a bunch of or a couple of different hosting tools and payment tools, and then either Notion or Google tools are the other. So let's get into those. Airtable, as I highlighted before, is really great for tracking contributions, organizing your submissions, and managing timelines with your contributors. And also internally with your team members. Airtable really simplifies everything from the initial outreach to monitoring contributor engagement. So it's like your command center, like the place you always go as you're hosting a bundle to help you track every detail for a smooth and organized bundle experience.\
\
[00:23:50.890] - Bree Boucher\
Hosting and payment tools. So when you actually make the decision to host a bundle, there is a lot of additional decisions now that need to be made. And some of those are deciding the type of method that you're going to be delivering the bundle through. So oftentimes, you'll use the software you already have in place, but that might mean that you need a connector tool that helps you to distribute the information. So if you remember the image that I shared right up the top, it was like a graph or a table of contributions that are using a third party tool to embed that into my website. So there are different tools that you need to consider. And so, like I said before, there's different decisions need to be made around the type of bundle you're hosting. So things like Thrivecart or other software, cart software, can be really useful to help you handle payments, but also for things like managing the affiliate tracking. And if you do go ahead with a paid bundle, it allows you to then pay the affiliates their commissions as well. So yeah, having a system for affiliate payments ensures that each contributor is motivated to promote the bundle.\
\
[00:25:29.170] - Bree Boucher\
So it's really a really good way to, I guess, incentivize even a free bundle because you can then mention, we'll let them know that there's an upsell. So oftentimes people will put an order bump connected to the bundle, which then allows someone to generate some income from that, even though it's a free bundle. So So for affiliates, there's that incentive or added benefit for sharing because they're getting a kickback on that. And then in terms of some other tools, so either depending on how you operate, you might prefer Notion or you might prefer Google tools. So Notion lets you contain everything in one place, whereas Google tools like Sheets, Docs, and Google Drive. You can actually connect them together quite nicely. And they'll be great for bringing together, storing this swipe copy or writing this swipe copy and then storing the graphics and helping to map out timelines and stuff like that. My personal recommendation is Notion because it does keep it all in one place and it just makes it nice and easy and clean for everyone to access what they need to, because you can even download graphics from within the Notion page.\
\
[00:27:07.840] - Bree Boucher\
You can share a calendar in there so people can see the timeline for the promotional window. They can add that to their own calendar. There's so many things they can do. You can even use it as an alternative to Airtable, especially now that there are things like forms and stuff coming in natively to the software. So just having those core aspects are going to be really useful for you. So if you already know some of these tools, then you are ahead of the game. Okay, so that is my presentation. I wanted to share with you a couple of next steps that you can take if you're ready to take action. So the first thing is you'll find a link to my freebie, My Bundle Secrets podcast. So I mentioned that earlier, there's a couple of podcast episodes you'll want to check out. So tune in to that for insights and bundles from participating through to hosting. There's a whole bunch of different episodes in there. There's a couple of debriefing type ones where I talk to other hosts. And yeah, there's some great content in that. If you are thinking you want to try your hand at hosting a bundle, then inside the speaker bonus bundle, you will find my workshop called, So You Want to Host a Bundle?\
\
[00:28:35.980] - Bree Boucher\
Now What? That's really great if you are thinking about hosting that bundle, are you unsure of those next steps? And it covers everything from planning through to promoting your bundle. So it's actually a workshop with some additional resources. And I like to share this a lot as the first stepping stone. So sometimes it's even good to what to watch the workshop because if you're still thinking, I wanted to host a bundle, but you're like, is it now or is it in six months time, being able to watch this workshop will actually give you some really good clarity about how ready you are. So it actually helps with your readiness aspect of hosting a bundle. And it gives you some timeline So you know what actually is involved. And it gives you a bit more of a thorough understanding of everything. So even for people that are thinking about down the ..., definitely grab it now while you can and come back to it when you are ready to consider hosting a bundle. So there you go. That is my workshop. I hope you have enjoyed this presentation. Make sure to find me on social media @TheBreeBoucher.\
\
[00:30:05.280] - Bree Boucher\
And look forward to hearing from you. Let me know you've signed up for the podcast and let me know your favorite episode. All right. Take care.\

[00:00:59.700] - Caroline\
Yeah, we do this to ourselves and we've done it too. So, we're not immune to it. But we want you to understand, it can be easy.\
\
[00:01:08.440] - Tracy\
Absolutely.\
\
[00:01:09.690] - Caroline\
So, we all want our product creation to be sitting on a beach, you're poolside, relaxing, making stuff. And just like watching the money roll in. But in reality, we know that it feels like when you're first starting out screaming at your computer, ripping your hair out, freaking out. We get it. But it doesn't have to be that way. A really important distinction right from the get go that we want you guys to understand is we're bloggers, but at the same time, even bigger than that, this is a business.\
\
[00:01:45.750] - Caroline\
This is not just a blog. It's your freaking business. It means that you are going somewhere with this. This isn't just a hobby. This is something that you want to make you money, to be able to pay for your kids' school, retire your husband early, buy a dream house, whatever it is, just live your life and be able to provide for your family. This is a business. It's not a bad thing to say. So, just getting all that out of the way right off the bat.\
\
[00:02:13.180] - Tracy\
Okay, so let's talk about some truth bombs. First, a product does not need to be expensive in order for you to turn your blog into an online money making business. And guess what? Like we said, it does not have to be hard to make a product. And we're going to show you the easy way to do it. And the biggest truth that we want to remind you guys of what is easy to you is actually life changing for your readers. So, even though if you come up with an idea you're like, everybody already knows this.\
\
[00:02:46.190] - Tracy\
Guess what? They don't.\
\
[00:02:47.830] - Caroline\
They don't know it.\
\
[00:02:49.220] - Tracy\
And it's your job as a business owner to teach your readers what is common sense to you, so you can make it easy for them. And finally, yes, you can hear me say it. Yes, you can make money from a lower ticket product. You do not need to charge a fortune in order to make a lot of money with your blog. Let me just say, if you have a $7 product and you sell three to four of those products every day, which I think is kind of easy, especially if you have an engaged email list.\
\
[00:03:22.120] - Tracy\
You will make close to $8,000 a year from a $7 product.\
\
[00:03:28.120] - Caroline\
Just from a $7 product.\
\
[00:03:29.460] - Caroline\
And that's like a trip wire product. That's not even like if you promoted it to your list. This is just passive. We're here to teach you. We're not going to be like, oh, you need to have a $9,000 signature course that takes you 18 years and a small fortune to create. No, we want you to understand that these are the things, especially if you're like, I don't know how to make a product. I don't know if it's going to be good. We're here to make it easy for you.\
\
[00:03:53.850] - Caroline\
But the truth is, you are not starting from scratch with your product. You are not starting from ground zero at all. You already on your site in your head, everything. It's already there, what you need to make a product on your site right now. You don't have to do any extra work. You're just putting it into a different format.\
\
[00:04:14.680] - Tracy\
You're here to show you how to take a blog post that is the foundation of the product that you're going to make and turn it into a money making product. And this process that we use is not only easy, it's fast. So, you don't have to dedicate a month to create a product. You don't have to lock yourself in a hotel room while you're trying to write an ebook. No. It's nothing like that. This is fast, and it's something your readers actually want.\
\
[00:04:40.360] - Caroline\
So, but we got ahead of ourselves because we didn't even really introduce ourselves so, we're those crazy chicks who are here to talk to you about product creation. Because Tracy always makes me go first in introducing myself. Hi, I'm Caroline Vencil. I'm the owner of Carolinevencil.com. I started my blog in 2015. So, that officially makes me an Internet dinosaur. I am a full time blogger, mom of four little kids. I used to believe that selling was picky. I said up and down, I never wanted to do it, but here I am now.\
\
[00:05:11.880] - Caroline\
My favorite thing in the world to say to people is I make money when I sleep.\
\
[00:05:15.580] - Tracy\
And I'm Tracey Lynn, and I'm the blogger at Simple Living Country Gal. I started blogging after Caroline, so in this case, she's actually older than I am. I started in 2016. I'm the mum of four boys and GG of two grand boys, so I'm surrounded by men.\
\
[00:05:34.170] - Caroline\
You poor thing.\
\
[00:05:35.200] - Tracy\
I know, right? I started out being a revenue chaser. I do not recommend it, but then I turned into creating products, and that is now what I like to call my superpower. That's how I relax. I actually create products. And I love to show other women how to create products that they can then use to explode their businesses just like I did. Then you need to create your own products, guys, chasing ad revenue, especially when Pinterest is in charge of those page numbers coming over to your blog when we first start out with our businesses.\
\
[00:06:07.570] - Tracy\
That's not the way to go. It's a roller coaster, and it's stressful, and it is not fun. We want our business to be fun. And if you want to be in control, then you need to create products. And that way you can be in charge of how much money you make and when you want to make it.\
\
[00:06:27.660] - Caroline\
We wanted to share with you guys some of our, this is just our perfect product formula is what we call it the BOP perfect formula, which, if you try to say it ten times fast, like.\
\
[00:06:38.570] - Tracy\
It's going to hurt your mouth.\
\
[00:06:41.490] - Tracy\
It doesn't work.\
\
[00:06:42.190] - Caroline\
So, here's how this works. You've already written your blog post. Your blog post that you've already written that you've already created says my readers have this problem and need help fixing it. The product that you create says this is how my readers can take action without trying to figure it out on their own. That is a big distinction. You already know that your people are having a problem because they're on your blog post. They're on your site. They're looking for help. Your product is giving them that help.\
\
[00:07:17.970] - Tracy\
We just made the idea of coming up with a product super easy.\
\
[00:07:21.530] - Tracy\
Esasy peasy.\
\
[00:07:22.430] - Caroline\
Easy peasy. So, here's the way that it works. You're taking your person up this little staircase, you're starting them over here with your blog post. Then you're taking them to your $7 product and then you're taking them to your whatever it is next level, it doesn't have to be a huge jump. It can literally be just stepping stones. But you know that they're on this path because they landed on your blog post.\
\
[00:07:48.820] - Caroline\
You're giving them the help that they need in a different container by giving them a product that they can pay for.\
\
[00:07:55.980] - Tracy\
Yeah.\
\
[00:07:56.280] - Caroline\
So, that's all that it is.\
\
[00:07:57.470] - Tracy\
I love this image, this page.\
\
[00:08:01.120] - Caroline\
I know. Isn't it fun?\
\
[00:08:02.580] - Tracy\
Here's what it is. You guys, the blog post is at the bottom. That's the foundation for everything going forward. That's where everything is already started. You already did the hard work of writing that blog post. Your readers love that blog post, and that way you can take all of that information and transform it into an even more valuable tool that your readers can use. So, I love this.\
\
[00:08:26.850] - Caroline\
So, don't freak out because we know that we just threw a lot of information at you and you're like, I still don't even think I want to make a product. The good. I'm reading your, Tracy, sorry.\
\
[00:08:35.340] - Tracy\
It's okay. Keep on.\
\
[00:08:35.930] - Caroline\
Time, come it.\
\
[00:08:39.390] - Tracy\
Not that one. This is mine.\
\
[00:08:39.720] - Caroline\
I'm sorry. I'm trying to kick a cat away.\
\
[00:08:41.930] - Tracy\
This is us.\
\
[00:08:43.120] - Tracy\
Go for it.\
\
[00:08:44.390] - Caroline\
Sorry. I love you. Please don't fire me. I was looking at a cat who I think is going to start jumping at my face. So, if you see a cat, wait, maybe he's going downstairs.\
\
[00:08:54.810] - Caroline\
Okay, this is real life guys.\
\
[00:08:57.020] - Tracy\
She's the person that's attacking her, and.\
\
[00:08:58.340] - Caroline\
I love her.\
\
[00:08:59.600] - Tracy\
Storm right outside my window.\
\
[00:09:01.110] - Caroline\
No, don't tell me that, you're recording.\
\
[00:09:03.420] - Tracy\
I know.\
\
[00:09:04.280] - Caroline\
It can't be a severe thunderstorm. Okay, the good news is you already have the content that you need to make your whole product on your blog. It's right there.\
\
[00:09:17.680] - Tracy\
It's right there. Ready to go. Don't make it hard, you guys.\
\
[00:09:22.770] - Caroline\
I'm going to have you do this one because I already took your site. I'm very sorry. Please don't fire me.\
\
[00:09:27.150] - Tracy\
Just keep going.\
\
[00:09:28.300] - Caroline\
Okay. So, we start with, like, everything that we just said. You remember the little going up the stairs. Everything starts with your top blog posts. This is where we find out where our readers are coming from. You can do this from Google Analytics or Pinterest or wherever it is that you find out where your traffic is coming from. So, this is to help you understand where to start your energy and your focus so that you aren't wasting your time. There's nothing worse than trying to be like.\
\
[00:09:57.430] - Tracy\
It's like that blog post that you're like, oh, my gosh. This is so good, and nobody reads it and you're like, well, there goes all my time and energy. We don't want that to happen to you when it comes to making a product. Start off with the ones that are bringing in the most traffic, because that's what your audience is already looking for.\
\
[00:10:15.950] - Tracy\
And I think that's an important point to make, because if your audience is already at the blog post, that's solving a problem for them. When you turn that blog post into a product, the audience is already there.\
\
[00:10:28.610] - Caroline\
Yeah.\
\
[00:10:28.860] - Tracy\
They're just tapping their fingers on the table, waiting for you to come up with the next step. So, when you can ride the coat tails of a popular blog post, it's like selling something to an audience that is ready and waiting for you. So, yeah.\
\
[00:10:42.750] - Caroline\
It's so true. It works, too.\
\
[00:10:46.230] - Tracy\
Yes.\
\
[00:10:46.560] - Caroline\
Let's see. Are you going to like me today? No. Okay. There we go. Now, it does.\
\
[00:10:50.980] - Caroline\
Okay.\
\
[00:10:52.050] - Caroline\
And then we create the product for that. Whatever that next step is after your blog post, that is your product. That's it. It's really that simple.\
\
[00:11:05.530] - Tracy\
Yeah. So, it's problem, blog post, next step, product. That's all it is, you guys. And I think Caroline and I were talking about this before we filmed. I think we just have this mentality of thinking it needs to be hard, because the word product is sort of a scary word, especially when you're new to doing this.\
\
[00:11:26.400] - Caroline\
Yeah.\
\
[00:11:27.190] - Tracy\
I think we have it in our heads that it needs to be life altering. It needs to change the world. It needs to solve all the problems in society in order for it to be a valuable tool. And it does make you guys. Your readers are just looking for the next step. So, don't make it harder. Keep it easy, not only for you, but for your readers as well.\
\
[00:11:48.690] - Caroline\
Yes. And it doesn't have to be. And this is the big thing for me was realizing that there's a lot of product levels that you can get to before you have $1,000 course.\
\
[00:12:00.920] - Tracy\
Right.\
\
[00:12:01.450] - Caroline\
And in my head, it's like, well, I don't have enough content to make $1,000 course yet, so I guess I just can't make any product.\
\
[00:12:09.100] - Tracy\
Yeah, that's not true.\
\
[00:12:11.020] - Caroline\
That's not the truth.\
\
[00:12:11.400] - Caroline\
It's not the actual truth. It's how we feel.\
\
[00:12:15.510] - Tracy\
How we feel.\
\
[00:12:15.840] - Caroline\
But in reality, people need to have that lower level product before they're willing a lot of times to go straight in and buy a big $1,000 horse. Like you can't just go straight like from playing around like doggy paddle in the shallow end to going off the high dive. That's not how we want our people to be. We got to give them those steps to get in there. So, this is where the fun part happens. Guys, we're going to be dishing on our, it's three, but it's technically four favorite things that we can do.\
\
[00:12:48.080] - Tracy\
Let's just go for it and say it's four.\
\
[00:12:49.670] - Caroline\
We're going to call it four, even though technically we just called it a bonus, but we're going to go for it.\
\
[00:12:54.180] - Tracy\
Okay. So, Caroline and I love to give practical examples so you can really take action. So, we're not hearing people. We're all about giving you actionable things. So, we're actually going to give you four product ideas that you can literally start creating as soon as you're done watching this slide show. Product idea number one is to take your blog post content and use it to create a guide or a binder. A binder is like the buzzword right now. People love binders, so you could take it, turn it into a binder.\
\
[00:13:28.510] - Tracy\
We kind of have different parts that we put in a binder, and it all starts with a cover, and then you want to add an intro. Now, when we say intro, what we mean is the steps in written form of how to use the product that your people bought. And the reason why an intro is so important is because sometimes people buy products quickly, but don't use them right away. So, if they buy a product and it's just the pages of the product, they're probably going to say in their heads, why did I get this?\
\
[00:13:58.440] - Tracy\
Why is this? Why did I spend money on this? And the intro reminds them what it was, why it's so amazing how they can use it to take the next step to solving the problem your blog post wrote about and why it's going to transform them and fix the issue they're struggling with. Then you want to add in a breakdown of each step that you wrote about in your blog post, going into a bit more detail. Then you can add in checklists. You can add in a filled out checklist, a blank checklist that they can customize.\
\
[00:14:32.990] - Tracy\
You can add bonus tips. You can have a shortcut sheet. You can have a calendar, planner pages, whatever you need to round out that binder. Keeping always in your mind what your blog post was about. It needs to relate to that blog post, so it's the next natural step for your readers when they're reading your blog. That post.\
\
[00:14:53.940] - Caroline\
I love that. And here's the fun thing if you're like, I don't know how to make a binder. You've already inside of your blog post whether it's like the ten things that you need to blank, you're still giving them the steps. Now you're giving it to them in a form that they'll be able to take and put it into action. That's the whole thing. You've already written the words, copy and paste those words. Copy and paste the words that you've already used. Give them a blank space underneath of it, so they can fill it out.\
\
[00:15:24.810] - Tracy\
That's it. That's it. That's it.\
\
[00:15:26.030] - Caroline\
And you're not coming up with it from scratch. And you don't have to feel bad that you've already written the words in a different place. You're giving it to them in a place that they're able to take action from it and not just absorb the content but actually do something about it.\
\
[00:15:40.710] - Caroline\
Number two.\
\
[00:15:41.830] - Tracy\
Product idea number two, create an interactive workbook. So, this was something else Caroline and I talked about because sometimes workbooks scare people, but if you use the word interactive, it makes it more of a you and them collaboration on the product. So, again, you're going to start with the cover. Again, you're going to have a written intro of what the workbook is and why it is so amazing. And then you're going to break down each step that you wrote about in your blog post in a QnA format form.\
\
[00:16:13.650] - Tracy\
This allows your reader to be your partner in your blog post, and it allows them to put their own thoughts down on paper and mingle them with yours, creating a really valuable tool for whatever it is you wrote about in your blog post. And you want to include pages for notes and journaling you want to add in planner pages again, a calendar. You can add in the same pages we talked about in product number one, checklist, and blank checklist and filled out one. You make the rules because these are your products.\
\
[00:16:45.280] - Tracy\
We're just giving you an idea of where to start. How deep you go. All depends on you.\
\
[00:16:53.590] - Caroline\
It doesn't have to be hard, guys. It can be as simple or as big as you make them. And here's something else really quick about workbooks. We've seen workbooks that started, like ten pages, and we've seen them go up to more than 300. Like there is no limit. There is no like right number for any of those like workbooks or binders like you make the rule.\
\
[00:17:14.220] - Tracy\
No one knows your people but you, so we can't set a limit on things. You know, if they're going to get overwhelmed by 300 pages and you know, if they're going to get frustrated because you only had to.\
\
[00:17:25.330] - Caroline\
Yes. Oh, that's so good. Okay, sorry. Number three, this is my favorite thing in the world to do. This is my absolute favorite thing in the entire world to do. And I am not kidding. You're reading this and you're going, no way. Yes, way. I sell these every single time I run a sale on my own shop. I make $1,500 in a weekend. This is printing money. Okay, so that's my preface by saying literally, take your blog post, copy and paste it into a Google Doc, which is free or a word Doc if you so chose.\
\
[00:18:02.140] - Caroline\
And make it into an ebook, literally make it into an ebook. Get rid of any of the awesome boxes. Make sure that your photos make sense in that context. Use your most popular Pin as a cover for your.\
\
[00:18:21.670] - Tracy\
That's a fact.\
\
[00:18:21.960] - Caroline\
I thank you so much. For your ebook, add in page numbers, give it a copyright at the bottom. Boom. That's it.\
\
[00:18:29.800] - Caroline\
You got it.\
\
[00:18:31.000] - Tracy\
That is literally it. When she first told me this, I'm like, Nah, I sell them now too. And people buy them.\
\
[00:18:39.400] - Caroline\
I have been selling these since 2016 because I was afraid, this is full story. I was afraid that if I sold anything that people would be like, oh, that's icky. So, I'm like, this is the easiest thing that I can think of.\
\
[00:18:55.840] - Tracy\
Literally.\
\
[00:18:56.390] - Caroline\
Anyway.\
\
[00:18:58.330] - Tracy\
Sorry, guys, we had to check out for tech issues, but we're back.\
\
[00:19:02.380] - Caroline\
Okay.\
\
[00:19:05.510] - Tracy\
So, Caroline, what are your problems?\
\
[00:19:06.490] - Caroline\
Anyway, so, hang on. What?\
\
[00:19:09.110] - Caroline\
Okay. Okay, sorry. There was a child who poked his head in the door. Anyway, I was afraid that this was going to be too difficult, so I just started making these and I literally listed them for sale on my blog. And I'm like, no one is going to buy these. No one's going to buy these. I'm going to get yelled at because I literally took my blog post and made it into a different format. I literally took my blog post, copied and pasted it into Word and made it a PDF.\
\
[00:19:37.910] - Caroline\
Somebody's going to know. Here's the reality. I've been selling these things where it's now.\
\
[00:19:43.280] - Caroline\
Oh, my gosh.\
\
[00:19:44.010] - Caroline\
Is it five years? Was 2016 five years? Holy cow.\
\
[00:19:48.590] - Tracy\
Five years. Five years.\
\
[00:19:50.310] - Caroline\
I've been selling these for five years. I have never once gotten a complaint on these.\
\
[00:19:57.410] - Tracy\
And that is just telling what we said earlier. What is common sense to you is life changing to them?\
\
[00:20:05.750] - Caroline\
Life changing.\
\
[00:20:07.730] - Tracy\
Just because it's easy for you to create doesn't mean it's not going to be a valuable resource for your readers. So, I think we need to give ourselves a little grace, allow us to think of things more on our readers level and create what it is they're looking for, guys. That's it. Just create what you want.\
\
[00:20:29.030] - Caroline\
Oh, yeah. And just back to the whole concept of what is so intrude level, like, to us, like, Duh, doesn't everybody know how to do that? No, they don't.\
\
[00:20:39.780] - Caroline\
They don't.\
\
[00:20:40.230] - Caroline\
Tracy has shared truth bombs with me about organizing, and I'm like, I never thought about that in a million years. I share things about, like, budgeting. But to me, it's like, Duh, doesn't everybody do this? That's my primary niche is talking to women about money who don't know how to handle money. And I'm like, Duh, doesn't everybody do? No, they don't. And the second that you realize that, the second that you realize that what you've just been doing, like, muscle memory is a game changer for other people. That's when you can start to unlock the potential for your product creation, that's where it comes in.\
\
[00:21:19.340] - Tracy\
Oh, I love it.\
\
[00:21:19.850] - Caroline\
Thank you. That was a really good one. Okay, but we're not done yet.\
\
[00:21:23.930] - Tracy\
One more page.\
\
[00:21:27.350] - Caroline\
This is honestly one of our big things because we were like, do we really want to go a little bit next level?\
\
[00:21:35.150] - Tracy\
Guys, don't freak out when we say the V word. Please don't freak out.\
\
[00:21:37.300] - Caroline\
Please don't freak out when you hear the V word, and we all know what that is.\
\
[00:21:40.690] - Tracy\
It's video. It's video\
\
[00:21:42.530] - Caroline\
Here, whether we like it or not. Video is, in fact, something that is becoming more and more important for our businesses.\
\
[00:21:52.130] - Tracy\
Your people who see you and hear you.\
\
[00:21:55.790] - Caroline\
But here's kind of the bonus too of this bonus tip.\
\
[00:21:59.240] - Caroline\
You're taking your blog post and using it essentially as a script for a video.\
\
[00:22:06.600] - Tracy\
I know, right?\
\
[00:22:08.570] - Caroline\
It can literally be if you wanted to do it over a PowerPoint presentation without showing your face. If you want to show your face and just stand there like a talking head is what my I'm told that those videos are called, it's just you sitting there. However you want to do it, you can make that video using your blog post as a script, using that workbook or those planner pages or that binder that you've made in previous products, using that as an add on. And now you have an e course.\
\
[00:22:42.490] - Tracy\
An e course, you guys. Oh, my gosh. It literally is that simple. You're just going to add a video onto one of the product ideas we just mentioned. Add in a few extra bonuses, just like that. You have an E course. That's your double dollar signed product the next level up. And again, it's really that easy.\
\
[00:23:01.880] - Caroline\
Yeah. We make things a lot harder for ourselves when we come up with this idea of, like, well, if I do a video, then I have to have X, Y and Z kind of like, I need to have a DSLR camera and a lighting setup and a teleprompter. No. No. No.\
\
[00:23:19.970] - Tracy\
A lot of my videos are PowerPoints. People love PowerPoints. They like to read and see at the same time. So, PowerPoints are a great way to start.\
\
[00:23:30.250] - Caroline\
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.\
\
[00:23:31.100] - Tracy\
They really are.\
\
[00:23:31.790] - Caroline\
And by the way, your webcam on your computer or on your phone, your phone camera is perfectly fine.\
\
[00:23:38.860] - Caroline\
It's fine.\
\
[00:23:40.080] - Caroline\
You don't have to stress out.\
\
[00:23:41.620] - Tracy\
No.\
\
[00:23:42.590] - Caroline\
But here's kind of the fun part about doing this is you can make this into a big E course or a small one, and you can elaborate on your points that you said so that instead of doing you know ten tips in five minutes, you have ten different mini videos.\
\
[00:24:01.370] - Tracy\
Guys, did you hear what she just said?\
\
[00:24:03.380] - Caroline\
Now you have a big course.\
\
[00:24:04.960] - Tracy\
Now you have a big course.\
\
[00:24:06.340] - Caroline\
Now you have a big course.\
\
[00:24:07.780] - Tracy\
Yes.\
\
[00:24:08.180] - Caroline\
And this is all, by the way, we've come up with all of these different products, starting with a single blog post.\
\
[00:24:17.170] - Tracy\
Yes.\
\
[00:24:18.230] - Caroline\
We're not talking about going and finding more things all over your blog or even having to you know come up with brand new ideas or brand new concepts that you haven't already written down in some way, shape or form. It's all there.\
\
[00:24:30.790] - Tracy\
All done for you, ready to go. The hard work is the blog post. The product creation is easy.\
\
[00:24:38.270] - Caroline\
Yeah.\
\
[00:24:39.010] - Tracy\
So, there you go.\
\
[00:24:39.700] - Caroline\
That's true. And you have to let it be easy in order for it to be easy. So, we've already said this before.\
\
[00:24:46.930] - Tracy\
Oh, I'm sorry.\
\
[00:24:47.760] - Caroline\
No, you go ahead and say it because I'm looking at the corner. Now I'm like I did it again.\
\
[00:24:51.940] - Tracy\
We have a system. We just don't always pay attention to it. Okay, guys.\
\
[00:24:55.580] - Caroline\
We? Yo, I don't pay attention to it. Okay. Anyway, continue.\
\
[00:24:59.260] - Tracy\
Alright. Your people want things easy, and they want to pay you for your knowledge. There is nothing wrong with asking someone to pay you for what you know, guys, this is a business. This is not a hobby. That is way back in 2014, 2015. Now, this is a business. And the quicker you put your mindset on that you are a business owner, and this is a business that you're running to support you and your family with, the easier it's going to be to implement all of those money making resources on your blog.\
\
[00:25:33.290] - Caroline\
Yeah, there it is.\
\
[00:25:36.410] - Tracy\
And there's the thunder.\
\
[00:25:38.100] - Caroline\
Oh, no. Well, I didn't hear the thunder. I'm trying to see if it's going to go to the next page. Okay. But here's the thing that we've both encountered in our own lives, and we know that you're probably thinking it too. Making product has to be hard, right?\
\
[00:25:52.950] - Tracy\
Yeah. Even though we give you examples, you're probably still thinking. Oh, yeah, it sounds good in theory. But how do you actually make it work?\
\
[00:26:00.490] - Caroline\
So, we made an example for you. Go to the next slide.\
\
[00:26:05.100] - Tracy\
Go to the next slide.\
\
[00:26:05.260] - Caroline\
There we go. So, meet Lacey T, bearing in no resemblance to anybody who we know.\

We can help them with our tips, and we don't want to hold anyone back because we think they already know them.\
\
[00:28:46.480] - Tracy\
Odds are they don't. And even if they do, remind them of those tips and those tips off and get them out there. So, your readers can see them and use them because they need to hear them.\

**Transcript:**\
[00:00:09.210] - Chelsea Clarke, herpaperroute.com\
Hey, how is it going, everybody? I'm Chelsea, and I'm so happy to get to be at the Blogger Breakthrough Summit again because I got to be here last year and it was so much fun.\
\
[00:00:23.430] - Chelsea\
So, thank you, Elizabeth, for welcoming me back. I'm very honored to get to be here. And I'm really excited to get to chat about affiliate marketing because I am obsessed with it and I am really, really stoked to get to talk to you guys about affiliate marketing, why it matters, why you should do it and how it can really boost your blog income. So, that's what we're going to be talking about in this session.\
\
[00:00:49.230] - Chelsea\
And if we haven't met before, my name is Chelsea Clarke. I am a content monetization strategist, a digital investor and a business broker. I help creators learn how to monetize their content and increase their profits with affiliate marketing, digital products and funnels. I'm also a mom and a solopreneur who has scaled my blog to half a million dollars in 2020. I founded the entrepreneurship and Affiliate Marketing Blog, Herpaperroute.com, which has now grown to a school, a Podcast and a community of over thirty thousand entrepreneurs who are there to learn about how you can make more money with your content. And I also founded a boutique brokerage called Blogs for Sale.co. And that's where I help people buy and sell niche online businesses like blogs, websites, e-commerce sites, apps, Amazon, FVA businesses and more. So, if you are in the market to buy a niche website or an established online business, do come and chat with me over at Blogs for sale.co. We have a ton of really cool listings right now that you can take over.\
\
[00:02:01.920] - Chelsea\
So, before we get started, you guys have heard this before, turn off your phone, close your other tabs, go to a quiet place and get rid of any distractions, which I'm sure you already are because you are here watching this Summit already. But it is worth mentioning because we are going to cover a lot and I don't want you to miss anything. So, let's talk about what you will learn today in this session with me. So, first, we are going to talk about what is affiliate marketing and why you should make it a focus in your blogging business. We're going to talk about why your authority in your niche matters so much when it comes to making affiliate sales and what you can do to grow your authority. And, of course, we are going to talk about the three types of offers that you should make, that you should be putting your focus in so that you can get the maximum benefit from your affiliate promotions, because I want you to work smarter, not harder. And we want those passive revenue streams.\
\
[00:03:06.090] - Chelsea\
So we're going to talk about what you can do to work less and earn more. Okay, so let's get started. First up, what is affiliate marketing? So affiliate marketing in a nutshell is when you partner with a brand, they give you an affiliate link, which is a tracking link or a tracking code. You go and you share that link around. And when someone uses that link like they click it and then they go on to the partner's website and make a purchase, you get a commission for referring that sale.\
\
[00:03:40.860] - Chelsea\
So, you would spend your time going out, creating content, promoting the content, making sales, and then you get paid. Usually it's just right to your PayPal address, plain and simple.\
\
[00:03:52.560] - Chelsea\
So, once you set up your affiliate marketing business and you start promoting a proven product to the right niche, you can build a thriving, repeatable and scalable income. So, now that you know why you should start affiliate marketing and the benefits that you can get from this type of business model, let's take a quick look at some of the steps that you need to take to get started.\
\
[00:04:14.430] - Chelsea\
So the first thing I would want to mention is that you should always invest in your knowledge. While it's entirely possible to find free information on the Internet, I cannot stress enough just how much a difference it makes when you actually invest money into a mentor or a course. The learning curve can be long and steep when starting an affiliate marketing business. But learning from a mentor who has made all those mistakes and got the exact blueprint to where you want to be will shorten the time it takes you to get to success. And also free information can often be outdated and made by someone who hasn't actually had the success that they make out. So, when you invest your money into a quality affiliate marketing course or you hire a coach, it will drive you to take action, to not give up and not get set, not get upset by the setbacks that everyone may experience from time and time again.\
\
[00:04:14.430] - Chelsea\
And there are a lot of quality affiliate marketing courses out there. I have one myself. It's called the Blog Monetization Course. If you're interested in that, you can come check that out. But I'm just going to keep on rolling along.\
\
[00:05:20.050] - Chelsea\
So, now let's talk about how to make more affiliate sales. The first thing I want to mention is that if you can niche down, you will be way, way ahead, because when you reach down. You have a focus niche on your website. You talk about products that make sense with each other or a overhanging topic. You're just going to have a way easier time finding the ideal customers that are interested in those types of products that you want to promote if you can keep everything into one niche.\
\
[00:05:53.950] - Chelsea\
And before you even choose a product, I would say start thinking about what your niche is. Think about a niche that you are passionate about. You have used or at least you have some skill in that certain area because affiliate marketing works best when you choose one area to work in and you position yourself as an expert. If you try to sell anything and everything, this will not make people trust you and buy from you.\
\
[00:06:18.580] - Chelsea\
So, another thing to consider is, is there money to be made in that niche? Well, I'm an advocate for following your passions. If you're never going to make any money, you may need to think out of the box slightly. And an idea is to look into sub niches. So if your passion is sharks, for example, there might not be a lot of money to make around that topic with affiliate marketing. But maybe you could look into promoting a digital marine biology course online or some tools that marine biologists might need. This is an extreme example, but hopefully you can see what I mean. But if you want to get into the most profitable niches, these are health, wealth and relationships because everybody wants to be healthy, everybody wants to be wealthy, and everyone wants that great relationship. So, you don't have to worry about these niches being saturated as there is always going to be demand for products in these areas.\
\
[00:07:16.750] - Chelsea\
Also, even as a beginner, you can make money up against marketers with big social media followings. You just need to create an irresistible offer. My next point is to promote what you know. So, on that same note, with niching down and deciding about a niche that you want to work in, you should promote products that you really understand you've used, you know, or you have done solid research on so that you can talk about from a honest perspective.\
\
[00:07:48.790] - Chelsea\
When you talk about products that you really do know, it's a lot easier to write about and a lot easier to make sales with. And next, you should really get personal and showcase your authority, because authority is the thing that will really, really guide you and make your readers feel confident in you and trust you and trust your opinion, so that they feel confident to open up their wallets to the brands that you are recommending.\
\
[00:08:18.340] - Chelsea\
So, some ways that you can boost your authority would be, first of all, make sure that you have a professional headshot of yourself on your website. Do not put a selfie up on your sidebar where you took it yourself and it's all pixilated and like, just bad. Go do yourself a favor. Go and hire a photographer and get those professional headshots. And I don't mean the type where you're like super formal and, you know, like with a backdrop. I mean, like a life style photo shoot where you're either outside or you're at your home office or at a coffee shop- somewhere that just gives some personality to show what it is that you do and who you are. And you can, you know, showcase your style and all that good stuff. And of course, in your photos, smile, show that you're friendly and approachable and, you know, a cool, happy person. And then, of course, always include your name and talk about a little bit of personal background. And explain in anything that you're talking about. Remind people why your tips matter, why your expertise should come into play and why they should listen to you. So, that may be mentioning education that you have. You have a certain degree that makes sense for the niche that you're working in or you have some sort of awards. Or you've been able to grow tons of traffic or a huge email list or community. Or you're making six figures. Or whatever it is that shows that you are the authority in this niche. Just don't be shy, put yourself out there and show that. People want to see that and they want to be able to relate and understand where you're coming from.\
\
[00:10:00.910] - Chelsea\
And next, of course, you don't want to waste your time promoting products that pay a low commission. So make sure that whatever you're promoting, you're focusing on high paying commission affiliate programs or even better recurring commission, where you get that sale one time and then you earn a commission for every month, that that customer stays a customer of the brand.\
\
[00:10:23.740] - Chelsea\
And if you stick around until the end, I have a free gift for you to share with you that will help you with your recurring commission affiliate program. So, I will get to that in just a moment.\
\
[00:10:34.690] - Chelsea\
But first, when we're talking about what type of products you're going to want to promote, like I said, think of products that you use and love already. Those companies could be ideal for you to promote as an affiliate because you already know and believe in them. And again, look for products that have a high average sale price so that you make a good amount per sale. So, that's in addition to making sure that the brand pays you a high commission. The actual price of the product should be high, too. And you're going to want to make sure that that product has a professional sales page, because this is what the customer will see initially and you want it to be good. And now remember, whatever you decide to sell will be a reflection of you. So, make sure that you're promoting things that you really do believe in.\
\
[00:11:19.480] - Chelsea\
Okay, so let me know in the comments how do you show your authority right now? What are some things that you are already doing that help to show your audience why you know your stuff and why you are the person to listen to?\
\
[00:11:36.760] - Chelsea\
So, I think we covered the authority offer pretty well, and now I want to talk about the supporting offer. So, this is something that you would create like a digital product. You would create a passive product that educates your ideal customer about the affiliate products that you promote. This could be an online course, a membership or a resource library, something that gives your customers more information and educates them on why this product is awesome. But not just that. You're also going to use this passive product, the supporting offer, because you want to get people into it who will be interested in buying the product later.\
\
[00:12:20.680] - Chelsea\
So, you are going to use this product to show a pain point or a problem that people are having that the product will then solve. So, you want to use this as a way to educate people, but also really illustrate the pain points and the problems of what life is like without that product. So, that then once they've realized that you can explain all the benefits and reasons why the product really could solve those problems and this supporting offer, I like to do this with a webinar or a mini course.\
\
[00:12:59.710] - Chelsea\
You can even set up a course and make it free so that it's used as a lead magnet. You're just getting all of these people in and then once they're in, you can really hone in on the reasons for why the product will be really helpful. And if you have it for free, it's a lot easier to get people in. Right, because they don't have to commit to buying anything. Everybody loves free stuff.\
\
[00:13:21.250] - Chelsea\
So, using your supporting offer is a great way to make affiliate sales after.\
\
[00:13:27.490] - Chelsea\
And my third tip that I want to talk about is the monthly lunch offer. Now, this is when you set up a promotion plan system. So, you create some sort of blueprint or system for how you would promote a product, how you would have a launch as if it was your own product. But you're going to be talking about the affiliate product.\
\
[00:13:52.450] - Chelsea\
So, let's say that you're starting in January. So, on January, you are going to set up a sales page. Maybe you're going to do a webinar, you're going to have that supporting offer. You may create some lead magnets and up sells. You're going to write your sales emails, your nurture sequence. You could think up some bonuses that you may have to go with this offer. You're going to set up your checkout, your car. You might use Thrive Card or Send Owl. And you're going to set up your ads. And what you are going to do is in January, you'll have this set up, you'll have this system, and in January you are going to have a "launch" for one of your affiliate products. And you're going to use all of these things, a sales page webinar, the lead magnets, the bonuses. And for 30 days, this is what you're focusing on; this affiliate product launch.\
\
[00:14:43.210] - Chelsea\
And then maybe in February, you're going to do another launch of a different product, but you already have all of your launch items ready to go. So, you can just use the same sales page; just change the content around. It's really great. Also, if you use Elementor because you can just export the templates and then import it into another page. And that's really helpful. It's a free plugin- Elementor. And you might do another webinar. You've already got your webinar worked out what worked for the first one. So, you just recreate it and you do it again for a different product. And you literally just go through that list and every month you launch a new affiliate product. And when I say "launch", of course, you are not the owner of the product. You're an affiliate, but you are promoting it as if you would when you were launching your own products. And this is a really great way that you can create consistent income in your business because you just have that monthly launch plan. Nothing really needs to change. You just change a bit of the information in the product name. So, every month you have a different affiliate promotion to focus on and then you don't have to think about everything all at once.\
\
[00:15:51.070] - Chelsea\
But then, of course, you have done all of this work for each one. You don't want it just to go away. So, then you can repackage these launches into a mini training or a digital product that can be bought on demand afterwards.\
\
[00:16:03.670] - Chelsea\
So, after you've done that whole January launch, everything that you did, that webinar, the sales page, all that stuff, turn that into a mini course and put it up for sale in February. February, you're thinking about the next launch, so you don't have to think about what you did in January. It's just up and it's selling now for you as you're focusing on the next affiliate product.\
\
[00:16:23.680] - Chelsea\
And by the end of the year, you will have 12 really great affiliate promotions, all set up, running, working as you sleep. You are making commissions.\
\
[00:16:36.110] - Chelsea\
Now, I want to go over some action steps with you, but first I want to see if you have any questions. I will be in the chat. Well, we're live, so feel free to jump in and ask me some questions. And also, I have a Facebook group for bloggers. So come on over. It's Facebook.com/groups/herpaperroute and I'm always around there. I can answer your questions there, too.\
\
[00:16:59.990] - Chelsea\
And before we jump into our action steps, I mentioned that I want to give you a free gift. And I think that this is a great time to do it. So, I have created a really simple cheat sheet of recurring affiliate programs. It's my little black book of recurring affiliate programs that you can check out and join the ones that you like right away. They pay a recurring commission. So, you can get a copy of my list of the best recurring commission affiliate programs that you should be earning from by going to Herpaperroute.com/black and you can get that for free.\
\
[00:17:33.980] - Chelsea\
And I also want to mention that for everyone who has upgraded to the Blogger Breakthrough Summit Pro Pass, you get my premium affiliate marketing strategy eBook included with the Summit upgrade. And so, definitely go and upgrade to your Summit propolis if you haven't already.\
\
[00:17:54.410] - Chelsea\
And now lastly, let's just quickly go down a couple action steps so that you can take away what you should work on today right away.\
\
[00:18:03.740] - Chelsea\
Okay. So first, you should be joining lots of high paying affiliate programs and focusing your efforts on those programs that pay a high commission and also that the products themselves are a high enough price, that it just makes sense for you to be focusing your efforts on.\

[00:18:21.620] - Chelsea\
The next step is you're going to want to download my recurring affiliate programs, Freebie, and you're going to want to start thinking about your digital product that can be your supporting offer to sell your affiliate products.\
\
[00:18:34.130] - Chelsea\
And next, you're going to want to plan a launch that you can rinse and repeat to promote a different affiliate product each month.\
\
[00:18:43.670] - Chelsea\
And lastly, I just want to add this in. You should be making more offers. You can't expect to make any sales if you don't get out there and make more offers. So, don't be shy. Get out and show the world what you are promoting or why you love it, why it really has helped you and excites you and why you think it'll help someone else. Because remember, if you were coming from a place of helping and educating and not from a place of just trying to get sales, in turn, you will actually make more sales because you are actually helping people. And that should be your focus above all.\
\

**Transcript:**\
[00:00:12.690] - Chelsea\
Welcome to the class. We're going to be talking about affiliate marketing and some things that you can and do or implement or some mindset stuff that you can work into your daily lifestyle that can actually help you make more money as an affiliate marketer, as a creator in general. My name is Chelsea Clark. I'm the founder of Her Paper Route. Her Paper Route is a blog, a podcast, a community, all for creators and people who want to learn how to make money in interesting ways online.\
\
[00:00:45.120] - Chelsea\
So, we featured creators who are doing just that in addition to offering courses and educational resources on our website, herpaperroute.com and the Her Paper Route podcast. So, when I started that business, my whole purpose was I wanted to be able to create a space where creators could be inspired by other people, how they are making money in interesting ways online, like I said. So that you don't have to just, you know, depend on a nine to five or waste your money in the stock market or, you know, make bad investments and just have that conversation about money, you know that uncomfortable stuff. Let it just be all out there into the world, so that everyone can be smarter with the money that they have and make more of it through investing, through creating online companies for themselves and just everything in between.\
\
[00:01:39.310] - Chelsea\
So that is what my company does and that's what I'm going to be sharing here on this call today is some tips for what you can do to make more money through affiliate marketing. So, the first thing I want to say is a good place to start is, what the heck is affiliate marketing? Well, it's very simple. Let's call you a creator. You have a website or an Instagram account or a newsletter, whatever your platform may be.\
\
[00:02:04.210] - Chelsea\
You have an audience around your brand, and other brands will want to get in front of that audience that you've put together, and they're going to pay you a commission when you refer sales to them. So, in very basic, in a nutshell, let's say that you have a home decor site, you have your website, you're recommending some products that you found at, let's say, I don't know, Home Depot. It's not really home decor, but you found some really cool home products at Home Depot. You put links on your website that are affiliate links. And when someone comes to your website, they click on that link, and they go on to make a purchase on anything on Home Depot's website, you're going to get a commission.\
\
[00:02:47.140] - Chelsea\
So that just means that Home Depot is going to pay you a percentage of whatever that customer went on to buy. Now, it does not cost that customer anything extra. Home Depot or whatever brand, just pays you off of the sale that they get. So, it's just really easy for people to come and buy things and you earn commission just for recommending great products. That's very simple what affiliate marketing is.\
\
[00:03:12.310] - Chelsea\
And right now, we're going to share some strategies of what you can do to just make more money at it. But before we do do that, I do want to mention, like why the heck should you even bother listening to me? Who the heck am I? And I just want to say, no, I am not some big billionaire affiliate marketer. I do not have a private jet.\
\
[00:03:32.200] - Chelsea\
I do not aspire to have a private jet. I am a very normal, ordinary person. What I do is I actually own multiple niche sites, so multiple websites in different niches and they are all monetized with affiliate marketing. And by doing this, I'm generating over a million dollars in revenue through that. And it's just a great business model.\
\
[00:03:56.140] - Chelsea\
It's a great thing to do. Anybody can do it. You do not need to have any special skills, you don't need to have some sort of special personality to be able to do it. Literally, the fact that you are here and you want, you're curious and you want to learn about it, great, you're ahead of the game. Let's do it.\
\
[00:04:16.610] - Chelsea\
You're going into affiliate marketing. You have a blog, you want to monetize it, come at it with a mindset of a long term mindset. Okay? You're not expecting instant results. It's not about the short term game plan.\
\
[00:04:31.110] - Chelsea\
You are looking ahead to the future and you are planning out for seeing what you're going to be doing next season, like next quarter, next year. You have a game plan for the long term of how you're going to make your affiliate marketing business profitable and sustainable for that long term. Okay? So, we don't want to just start a blog and wonder why we haven't earned anything in the first month, and then just throw in the towel and give up. That is unfortunately what most people do.\
\
[00:05:01.500] - Chelsea\
And that is why most people end up not being successful with affiliate marketing because they just give up before the site has even had enough time to actually have a chance at making revenue. So, just know that you're coming into it. You are going to be here for the long term, right? You're ready to try things, you're going to test things, you're going to run different campaigns, and you're not going to give up too soon. You're just going to be consistent.\
\
[00:05:29.210] - Chelsea\
Come at this with a business plan. Your blog is not a hobby or your instagram influencer, a dream, that's not a hobby. This is an actual business. So, you need to treat it as such. So, come into this with a plan for your business.\
\
[00:05:46.650] - Chelsea\
Okay? So, think about a top of the world, like top-class athlete, right? They don't just do some random exercises here and there. Maybe one week they're not going to work out, and the next week, maybe they will. They don't look at it like that.\
\
[00:06:03.130] - Chelsea\
If they are planning to be successful in their chosen career as an athlete. They get up every day and they are working out and they're exercising, and they're bettering themselves, and they're always thinking about their next competitor, and you know their next big game, and everything like that. And that's how you should be thinking of this too. Have a plan for how you are going to grow your blog, your Instagram, your Tiktok, whatever it is. It doesn't really matter the platform, but you are coming at it with a plan and a system in place of how you're going to get there.\
\
[00:06:36.990] - Chelsea\
And it doesn't have to be fancy. I'm not saying you need to spend a week figuring this out. I mean, like after you finish watching this call, you're going to get a notepad and a piece of paper and you're just going to write out your plan. Just like that. Like creative.\
\
[00:06:50.370] - Chelsea\
Don't stop yourself, don't try to edit yourself. Just blah. Write it all out. Everything that you are going to do to grow your business, what your goals are, and how you are going to reach them in the next three months, six months, two year, put it out into the world, write it out as a notepad, and then start doing it.\
\
[00:07:11.660] - Chelsea\
Tip number three is accept that money is everywhere. It is just waiting for you to set up the systems to get to you. Okay? The money, the success, it's all already there. You've already got it.\
\
[00:07:25.810] - Chelsea\
You just haven't put the step into place yet, so that money can reach your bank account. And what I mean by that is you need to focus on creating content. You need to focus on building your brand and building your community. So, by creating content, that means writing blog posts or taking photos and posting it to your social media. You need to be getting the word out about what you do, so that people can see you and find you.\
\
[00:07:51.130] - Chelsea\
And when they see that content and fall in love with you, you want them to actually convert onto your email list. You want them to sign up for your digital products. You want them to join your community, your Facebook group. You are building a community around your brand. And that brand knowing now, and this can change, your brand can grow and evolve over time. But have an idea about what your brand is now and just run with it.\
\
[00:08:15.180] - Chelsea\
Just start being you. Start being your brand and creating that content now and know that everything can evolve in time. And once you have those things out in the world, those are your like tentacles out there in the world. All that money that's just waiting to be grabbed, it is going to come to you. So, a thing that we hear a lot is people, when they start a business, they're just so stressed out about money, whether they just don't have enough right now or they're scared they're not going to be successful.\
\
[00:08:42.550] - Chelsea\
And that is stopping them from actually creating, which is the most important thing right now, is creating, getting that content out. So, try to remove your thoughts of worry about money except you're getting that money. It's coming to you. Success is inevitable. And also, success is a decision. You have decided today that you will be successful.\
\
[00:09:03.870] - Chelsea\
There's nothing else to it. What else are you worried about, Susan? Get to work. Investing in yourself and investing in your business, in your future success. So, what that means is you should be paying attention to what other creators are doing. Pay attention to your, you know your competition.\
\
[00:09:28.500] - Chelsea\
Be reading all of these other blogs. Be reading Business Insider, be reading forms, have, whatever your niche is, be a sponge to all of the stuff that is going on in that niche, in that industry, and just educate yourself every single day. Stay on the nose of it. Just know what's going on in your industry and you will be successful in it.\
\
[00:09:51.820] - Chelsea\
Just having that, just, you're on it. So that's really important. Also invest in your education through courses. Get a mentor or a coach or take some self study courses, whatever it may be. Just educate yourself.\
\
[00:10:07.150] - Chelsea\
If you're in a niche that requires a professional certification, go and do it. Go to school, do what you need to do to be able to be the best that you can in your industry. And on that note of investing in yourself and in your business, come at this with a budget. Like, have some money to invest right now. You don't have to spend thousands and thousands of dollars, but you do need to invest in some software and some tools into some systems that can help you get ahead.\
\
[00:10:36.840] - Chelsea\
And it's going to save you time, and potentially, money down the road as well. And time is extremely valuable. So, when you start hanging out with high net worth people, people who are very successful and they're making a lot of money, you will soon realize that time is way more valuable than money. And one of the most simplest ways to do that, to take care of that, is to pay others to help you get ahead. And that could mean hiring a virtual assistant, could be hiring writers or an operator or someone to help with editing your podcast.\
\
[00:11:10.420] - Chelsea\
You know, this is a part-time remote type of role that you can offer someone as an independent contractor, does not have to break the bank. But thinking ahead and knowing that every bit of money that you're putting into your business right now and the people and the systems and the processes, that is what's going to help you get ahead faster. So that you can make all of that money that we're working towards. To be successful as an affiliate marketer, get out of your comfort zone. There are so many affiliate marketers out there who are doing really just the bare minimum and that's okay, right? But if you want to be ahead of them, if you want to be ahead of the game and you want to be making the big dollars in your business, and so you should, then you're going to have to go and do the things that most people won't. Go live on your social media.\
\
[00:12:04.060] - Chelsea\
If you're afraid of going live or doing like a webinar like this, or a virtual summit, or something like that, start by practicing. You know get on a podcast where you don't have to be on video, where you just be on audio first. Get a couple of those under your belt and then move into doing something like this, like a virtual summit, participating, being in a live webinar, hosting some sort of training for your audience or the people that are like building around your brand and they're falling in love with you, show up and talk to them. And it's probably going to feel really weird at first, like, okay, I put it off for way too long because I was scared. And then when I suddenly was like, I have to just do this.\
\
[00:12:44.830] - Chelsea\
I have to just let myself out of the gate and just do it, even though I was scared. Everything in my business shifted and my conversion rates went way up, started making way more affiliate revenue and selling my digital products and selling all the stuff that I was working on. Because people like to buy from people. They like to see your face, they want to hear from you. They want to know that you're a real person. And they absolutely want to know your little personality quirks and things that maybe you're uncomfortable with right now.\
\
[00:13:14.620] - Chelsea\
That's what's going to make you memorable. And people are going to think of you and love you and want to know anytime you have something new to offer because they get used to seeing you. Okay? So just like, don't be scared. It's normal to be scared, but do it anyway.\
\
[00:13:30.040] - Chelsea\
Get out of your comfort zone. To make more money with affiliate marketing, have an email list. This is a big mistake that a lot of affiliate marketers overlook, is they don't worry. They don't bother with having an email list, they just don't do it. And the people who do do it, they're making more money.\
\
[00:13:51.840] - Chelsea\
So, you should start an email list. If you don't have an email list, let today be the day. Just start one. You can even start on a free platform for now. You don't have to pay for it.\
\
[00:14:01.170] - Chelsea\
You can just, while you're building up a community, use the free version, the tool, the trials, whatever it is. And then as your community grows, you can upgrade to something better. But start it, just does another thing. Don't be scared to start your email list. You can create an email list today, like that.\
\
[00:14:17.040] - Chelsea\
Start sending your newsletter right away, even if only one person is on your list. People often say, well, Chelsea, I have an email course. And people ask me, well, when is too soon to start emailing my list? Like, I created a lead magnet, and then I have two people on my list, but I haven't emailed them ever and it's been six months.\
\
[00:14:34.720] - Chelsea\
Whoa. Start emailing them right away. Even if there's only one person on your list, speak in your newsletters as if there are a thousand people on your list, and just be you. And the most important thing is tell stories. Email marketing is all about telling stories, and you are selling through those stories.\
\
[00:14:54.970] - Chelsea\
It's not about being salesy or pushing sales on people or making anyone feel bad. You want people to feel inspired and educated and happy when they see your name in their inbox. And you do that by telling great stories through your newsletter. So that's what I want to say about that. And for some of you who may be newer to this, you heard me a second ago, say, lead magnet.\
\
[00:15:16.780] - Chelsea\
And what that means is it's just some sort of free resource that you give to your audience in exchange for them signing up to your newsletter, gift for them, giving you their email address and allowing you to contact them. So, things like a lead magnet could be like a PDF, a cheat sheet, a free mini course, whatever it is, whatever works for your niche. You just create something free that will make people excited to want to sign up for your newsletter.\
\
[00:15:44.810] - Chelsea\
Okay, here's my tip number seven about how you can make more money as an affiliate marketer. This is a good one. It's very juicy. And not too many people remember to talk about this, and it is to have actual conversations with people. So, it's so easy to just be behind our screens and you know type and just forget that there's actually real people on the other side of that screen.\
\
[00:16:08.960] - Chelsea\
This is a big one. If you can have something like a Facebook community, let's say, where you're able to say, hey, like, what if we jump on a call? I'd love to hear what you're working on and actually have offer like a one on one zoom call where you can just chat with people in your audience. Or maybe it's like a group call. You could have office hours or something once in a while, where people in your community can all get on a zoom call with you and you can just get to know them.\
\
[00:16:36.100] - Chelsea\
They can get to know you. You can offer some tips. You know they can ask questions. And just having those real conversations is going to make your success as an affiliate marketer just way ahead of anyone who would just not even bother to go that extra mile.\
\
[00:16:57.040] - Chelsea\
Tip number eight, and this is going to be freeing for some of you, you do not have to be on every social media in fact, you shouldn't. I would really recommend that you just pick one wherever your ideal customer is hanging out and you just focus your efforts there. Don't worry about being on every single social platform. What you can do is you can sign up for you know Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, and just reserve your brand names. You can have an account there and reserve your brand name.\
\
[00:17:29.100] - Chelsea\
But you don't need to feel like you have to be publishing content every single day to all of those. In fact, just pick one right now, and create content for the audience on that one platform. You can also repurpose all that content, right? You can just have it automated through automation tools where let's say, you're just focusing on Instagram, you publish stuff to Instagram, you can have it automatically go to your Twitter, and then show up on your Facebook page, and all that stuff just happening on the back end of the business. But it's not like an active thing that you feel like, you have to have all of these conversations and have these audiences all over the place because that honestly, can really, really affect people.\
\
[00:18:05.970] - Chelsea\
Especially, if you are trying to focus on creating content, which again, that's the most important thing. Remember, creating your valuable quality content that is selling all of your offers, all of your affiliate offers. If you're too busy trying to keep up with all these different social media platforms, you're going to burn out. Okay? I see it a lot.\
\
[00:18:25.410] - Chelsea\
So, free yourself, you do not have to be on all the social media platforms. Just pick one, get that up and running. And then if you feel like you can take on another one in six months to a year, do it. Just allow yourself to be freed of that social media commitment.\
\
[00:18:43.010] - Chelsea\
This is another big one, okay, they're all big ones. But this is so important. Don't let failure bring you down. And most importantly, don't let failure stop you from what you're trying to do. Failure is a totally normal part of success.\
\
[00:18:59.060] - Chelsea\
It would be weird if you started something just right out of the box and you had like just no failures, no issues, everything just was completely smooth sailing every single time. If you have failures, great. You can learn from that. Take those setbacks, take those things that feel awful in the moment and just use it to propel you to create even better content, even better products. Just build on what you are doing, and take all of those failures as lessons because that is just really going to help you grow.\
\
[00:19:33.410] - Chelsea\
And on that note too, I do want to say that no matter what, if you can channel, if you're feeling like that disappointment or anger about something failing, channel that back into your business. Or maybe, maybe you need to actually look inward and look if your goal is still what your goals are now, the goals that you set six months ago. Maybe that's not what you're trying to achieve now. Maybe your path needs to have a bit of a detour. And that is also really, really important part of success too.\
\
[00:20:07.140] - Chelsea\
So don't give up. Don't let failure get you down. Instead, use that failure to be better, do better, and you're going to get ahead. Because there's going to be haters.\
\
[00:20:17.130] - Chelsea\
There's going to be people who don't get it, don't care, you know just not interested. And that is good. We don't want to speak to everyone. We don't want everyone in our community. We just want a few right people in our community.\
\
[00:20:33.180] - Chelsea\
And we want the few right people to buy the stuff that we love. We want to make sure that those people see the right content at the right time, so that they can learn about the products through our affiliate content. Right? We don't need to sell to everyone. We just need to build a small brand of superfans, people who really love you and love what you do.\
\
[00:20:53.610] - Chelsea\
That's the most important thing. So, when you feel like, people are saying notso nice things, you know online, just ignore it, delete it, move on. Or even better, keep it there. But respond in your most professional, level-headed way, so that other people can see just your normal person, right? And your fans will support you no matter what.\
\
[00:21:19.010] - Chelsea\
And now my final tip. And then I'm going to give you something for free, really awesome, so stay tuned. My final tip is when you are working as an affiliate marketer and you are monetizing your content with affiliate links, do not put all of your bags, do not put all of your eggs in one basket.\
\
[00:21:40.030] - Chelsea\
Because things change, okay? Commission rates change. Affiliate programs, sometimes they will close their program altogether. Do not focus all of your efforts onto one affiliate program. In fact, you should just focus on a couple that really makes sense for your audience and for your brand.\
\
[00:22:00.750] - Chelsea\
And know that when you can actually reach out to your affiliate manager, you can actually ask for increased commission rates. Like rates that are not publicly posted anywhere. If you're creating great content and you're getting conversions for a brand and you've been doing so for maybe a couple of months, heck yes. Go and reach out, and actually ask if they can give you a commission increase. And most of the time they will because they want people who are eager to promote their content.\
\
[00:22:31.810] - Chelsea\
They want to, you know you're making them happy. They want to make you happy too, because they want to retain you. So do not just focus on one affiliate program. And also when you start to get into this, don't just mush all everything into one site. If you're interested in all different types of niches, then you should probably have multiple niche sites and be able to monetize different sites.\
\
[00:22:56.170] - Chelsea\
So that let's say that an algorithm update happens and it tanks traffic on one of your sites, you know that you have a couple other sites that are still bringing in revenue for your business. And on that note of not putting all your eggs in one basket, I also want to say affiliate marketing is only one revenue stream. You should also have other things going on on all of your sites that also bring in revenue in addition to that affiliate revenue. So, things like having your own product for sale, your own digital product for sale, things like having display ads, being in a great ad network and having ads come up on your site SEO. When people click their ads, you get a little bit of some money from that too.\
\
[00:23:36.270] - Chelsea\
Just thinking about creative ways that you can generate revenue from your site in multiple ways. Now, on that note, I have some really cool things to share with you. And thank you everybody for sticking around and watching my session. I hope that it was helpful. So, I want to give you a free gift for sticking around.\

Liz Stapleton [00:00:00]:\
All right, guys, I'm excited for this session with Chelsea from her paper route. Chelsea, first of all, thank you so much for being here.\
\
Chelsea Clarke [00:00:06]:\
Thanks so much for having me. This is so fun.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:00:08]:\
Yeah, because we're going to talk about flipping blogs, which is actually something I've never done, but it's on my list to kind of learn more about because I go back and forth on my very first blog. I'm like, I really haven't touched it in, like, a year, and I want to get back to it, but am I really going to do I want to look at selling it and so feel like this is kind of the knowledge I need to have for that. So can you give us a little bit about your background and just what we're going to talk about today?\
\
Chelsea Clarke [00:00:32]:\
Yeah, absolutely. Well, I got started in marketing. I was in corporate marketing, and I was running blogs for big businesses and corporations, and I was having a blog myself as a hobby for a long time. But I wasn't monetizing it. I just didn't make the connection between the two. And then when I finally did, it was like, "Oh, this makes so much sense!" There's so much value in information that you can provide and educate people with, and there's so many ways to make money with your own website. So I quit that job, and I've been building and flipping websites ever since and in all different niches. So I like to niche down and pick one topic and kind of go deep on one topic per blog and then sell it. But then I also have my own website and blog, which is Her Paper Route, and that's where I share marketing tips and blogging tips. So when I'm working on a blog, I really just focused on all the different things that can provide value. So that's always been my way of getting into in and out of a blog quickly, and we'll go into more about the details of that. But yeah, in a nutshell, that's how I got my start, and that's what I do for a living now.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:01:43]:\
\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:01:43]:\
Okay. Yeah. So we're going to talk about how you kind of can get started doing that, how you can look at flipping it, what to look at in terms of, I would guess pricing, you're selling it, and kind of how to do that. Because, I mean, I don't think I Wouldn't even know where to start if I wanted to sell it, to be honest. I think I got one email of someone being like, I might be interested in buying it, and I was, like, not interested at the time. But yeah. So I'm really interested to hear what you have to say. I'm going to let you kind of kick things off because I'm not quite sure where to ask this question to start. So where should we start? If that's kind of what we're looking to do? Whether we're looking to sell a blog, that we're just our heart's not in it anymore, or if we're looking to flip them. How you do?\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:01:54]:\
\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:01:56]:\
\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:02:04]:\
\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:02:05]:\
\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:02:08]:\
\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:02:10]:\
\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:02:21]:\
\
\
Chelsea Clarke [00:02:22]:\
Sounds good. Yeah. So let's say that you have a blog and maybe you weren't intending to sell it, you were intending to run it for a while, but for whatever reason, you lost interest, you got bored, you got busy, you don't want to keep running it anymore. And that's always a big thing for people that want to sell, is they just don't have the time or they've lost interest. It just doesn't fire them up anymore. So you would be surprised how many people out there will pay money for your blog. Even if it's not making any money, you'll definitely get more money if it's making revenue. But there are people who want starter blogs, so I always say, don't cut yourself off before you've actually given it a shot because there are lots of people and buyers out there who want all different types of websites. So if you have a website, let's say it's getting a little bit of traffic, maybe it's making some money in affiliate sales, that's great. You'll really want to focus on getting more traffic to it and increasing the revenue. If you're willing to put in a bit of work, if you just want to get out, you can just put it up, sell it and move on. But if you really want to get some money for it, I would say focus on using Pinterest to drive traffic. Running a promoted Pin, that's the fastest way. great for your advertising dollars to get traffic coming to the website. Because no matter what, a buyer is looking for a website that is active. Unless you're a flipper like me, and you're looking for a website that kind of hasn't been used for a while and there's room for improvement, most people aren't looking for that. Most people want something that's already generating money and they can just kind of come in and it's working for them. So if you can get your blog in the best shape that it can be, you're going to be able to sell for a higher price. And this talk, I think we're calling it, I think it's: Selling Your Blog for Six Figures. And that's absolutely possible. You just have to think about how much money you're making per month. So a general rule is a website is sold for the two years ahead, projected income. So if your blog is making $1,000 a month right now, times that by 24, we'll say we're going to sell it for the two year projected. So that's a listing price of about $24,000. But there's a lot of other things that can make it more value or sorry, a higher value. Things like if your traffic is really good, if you have beautiful design, if you have a large email list, that's always going to be a valuable asset for a buyer. If they can come in and they see you have customers, subscribers, that's just going to add more value. So just based on revenue alone, though, we're just saying that $24,000. Let's say that your goal is to sell your blog for $100,000, and your goal will be to have that blog making about $8,300 per month. And if you can run it for a year so you have a one year revenue history showing that it's making about $8,000, then you absolutely could be listing it in that six figure market.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:05:30]:\
Okay, quick question, because...\
\
Chelsea Clarke [00:05:35]:\
I could go blah blah, so please cut me off.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:05:37]:\
$8300 a month is 100 grand a year.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:05:40]:\
Yes.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:05:41]:\
So if you're doing two years out, wouldn't you technically really need to make like four grand-ish a month?\
\
Chelsea Clarke [00:05:46]:\
Exactly. Yeah. If we're just saying the two years, then yes, you cut it in half. But I always like to say you'll want to aim higher in your mind.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:05:54]:\
Absolutely.\
\
Chelsea Clarke [00:05:55]:\
The goal I should have mentioned that because that's going to make a lot easier. So also if your goal is to hit, say you want to hit 100,000 page views per month, you'll just be wanting to have a higher number in your mind because it's a lot easier to hit. If you aim for that one number, it's going to be more of a struggle, I find, just with the mindset around.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:06:16]:\
Mindset? Yes. The session I record earlier was on Mindset, so there's a session on that in the Summit, too. Don't you worry.\
\
Chelsea Clarke [00:06:23]:\
I can't wait to see everybody's interviews. I'm so excited to see the Summit.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:06:27]:\
I'm really excited how well it's come together and all the information. How generous all the speakers have been with their time and their knowledge, yourself included. It's really exciting!\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:06:37]:\
\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:06:41]:\
Okay, so that's kind of getting a guesstimate of what the value of your blog might be worth. But where do you start? Where do you list it, how many factors? Because I've worked with clients who bought their blog, and so I got a little bit of insight in sort of what they looked at. But it can vary a lot depending on the cleanup that needs to be done.\
\
Chelsea Clarke [00:07:06]:\
That's a great point that you make, too. That's an awesome point. I want to touch on that quickly because there's a lot of work that goes into, no matter what, your website is going to be a certain amount of work for someone. So if you can make it easier for someone, you fixed your broken links, you have things kind of a nice flow, the content is easy to read and that sort of thing. It's just making it less work for someone. So that's always good.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:07:30]:\
\
\
Chelsea Clarke [00:07:32]:\
Where you can list and sell your blog. There's a few places online now that I've been doing this for a while. I have a business called Blogs for Sale, and I just sell it, Blogforsale.co. And it's a marketplace where people work with me to list their blogs and I work with my network of buyers and we help find the right buyer for your website. But I'm certainly not the only place. So there's Flippa online. Flippa.com, that's a great place as well. If you want to get a higher selling price than Flipa generally Empire Flippers is great. You will need a very high value website to sell on Empire Flippers. They will require a larger revenue history and not all revenue is the same, which we'll jump into a little bit too, the different ways that you can bring money to your website. But yeah, those are like the main ones that are sort of the leading industry places to sell your website. And you can also just sell it yourself. You don't need a broker or an online marketplace. You probably have someone on your email list. If you were to send out a newsletter and say, "Hey, thank you so much for reading my blog all these years. I'm kind of thinking that I'm moving in a different direction, putting the word out there that my website is now for sale." I bet you, there's going to be someone on your list who will take interest, at least to reach out and discuss more with you.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:08:57]:\
Yeah, no, that's a great point. Okay, so once you've decided you want to sell your blog, or a blog that you have because you're working more on another one or whatever, because once you get into this, you get addicted and all of sudden, you have like 17 domains you own and three blogs. Each year, "Do I want to renew that domain? I'm not doing anything with it." And you know the different places you can kind of put it out there for sale. What do you need to put together to put it for sale? Kind of, what do you need to look at? Like you said, there's different revenue types that some are of more interest than others. What does that process look like?\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:09:38]:\
\
\
Chelsea Clarke [00:09:41]:\
Yeah. So when buyers are looking at a website and they're looking at where the money is coming from. If you provide a service that really takes you to do it, that's not going to be as attractive to a buyer, because they may not be able to replicate that same service that you do.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:09:50]:\
\
\
Chelsea Clarke [00:09:52]:\
\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:09:58]:\
Something like sponsored content, bringing in the majority of your income.\
\
Chelsea Clarke [00:10:01]:\
Yeah, like sponsored content maybe alright if the sponsors are supplying the article. But if you, the buyer, are familiar with writing and you're okay to take on that job, but yeah, exactly.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:10:12]:\
That's something that's a little less passive. Totally.\
\
Chelsea Clarke [00:10:15]:\
Totally. Yeah. The less passive, the less value for a selling place. But if you have a website that's making affiliate income, that's nice. That's a nice to have. And it's definitely a great way for you to make money while you're running the website. You're just going to hope that the buyer has some experience with affiliate marketing that they'll understand about, it's not always passive. You have to have traffic. You should be actively promoting your affiliate content. So it's a nice to have, definitely, but it's not the main thing that they're looking for.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:10:48]:\
Okay.\
\
Chelsea Clarke [00:10:51]:\
The top way that you can bring in money that will be the most attractive to a buyer is ad revenue with traffic. So if your website is getting a lot of traffic, whatever a lot means to you, it's making some money and it's in a premium ad network, all the better. So something like Mediavine, if you can get your website approved in Mediavine and stick with them for a couple of months to show a history of earning money with them, you are way ahead of the game and you have a high value asset. Your website is a high value asset just from that.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:11:23]:\
And we have a session from someone at Mediavine talking about SEO, which helps you get traffic. So definitely check out that session.\
\
Chelsea Clarke [00:11:30]:\
Yeah, I'll be checking that out too.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:11:34]:\
Yeah. So premium ad work networks. I feel like Mediavine is most well known because it does let you in usually around 25,000 sessions. But Ad Thrive, which is usually around 100,000. It's another premium one. Pretty much anything that's not like Media.net AdSense...I'm trying to think of another one that's not as good, but any of kind of the other ones usually.\
\
Chelsea Clarke [00:11:57]:\
Yeah, that's always good. It'll look nice on your listing wherever you're selling it. Just having that on there, people love to see that.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:12:06]:\
Yeah, because it also speaks to at least the minimum traffic that you have because those networks are exclusive to certain levels.\
\
Chelsea Clarke [00:12:13]:\
Yes, definitely. And also I think they're also limited to certain locations too. So if you have a lot of North American traffic, that's always appealing to a buyer, especially overseas buyers, too. They want that American traffic. So if you have a website, no matter where you live, like I live in Canada, but all my blogs are all US and all American customers. That's the cream of the crop if you can do that.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:12:37]:\
Yeah, okay. No, that's good to know. It's a good point. And what sort of ad network you're in, it also could depend on your niche. Right? Because search and ad networks don't like to work in certain niches or that's just not their area, and so if you get rejected from someone, that doesn't mean you can't get into another premium ad network.\
\
Chelsea Clarke [00:12:57]:\
Yeah, that's a great point.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:12:59]:\
Just from my little knowledge of various clients and years of blogging. Okay, so in terms of selling a blog ads are new super important. Affiliates, nice to have. Sponsored, may be good. And really the other monetization model for blogging is products. Does that play into selling it at all or what does that...\
\
Chelsea Clarke [00:13:20]:\
Yes, definitely! That was the next thing I was going to say is always, always have digital products for your blog. Create a course, create an ebook and create a free version of it too, so that it shows that you're getting people on your email list with the free offer, which then can lead into a paid course or a paid ebook. Buyers really want to see a website that also has digital content like that because that is just something that they will own when they buy it, it's theirs and they can resell it and continue to grow with it. So those top like, ad revenue and digital products always, always make that your goal.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:14:01]:\
And probably a history of sales of the digital products I would assume place into that as well. Knowing kind of your site conversion rate.\
\
Chelsea Clarke [00:14:11]:\
You tell me if I'm wrong and you're totally right. You are an experienced blogger. You know all this stuff. It's the same kind of thing that helps make your own blog successful, is going to be appealing to someone who wants to buy it. So it really is probably a lot of things that bloggers listening. Here are things that you're already trying to work on just for your own blog and your own business as you're trying to grow it. These are all things that are great that you're doing, because if you do decide to sell later, this is what people are going to see, the value in what you've done.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:14:43]:\
Yes.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:14:45]:\
So I do want to ask because when you sell your blog, at least as you're describing, you're not just selling the blog, you're selling everything that goes with it. So the email list associated with it. Which I assume there's some legal stuff there that needs to be worked out in order to do that, or some notification going on. So can you kind of walk us through that? I feel like people don't even realize how much stuff is tied to the blog sometimes. So can you share that?\
\
Chelsea Clarke [00:15:15]:\
Yeah. So first of all, whether you're selling your blog or not, the fact that you have a website, you need to make sure that you follow the laws for having an email list for...Yeah, so great. Check those out.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:15:31]:\
We have three sessions on legal stuff but I don't know that we cover actually selling your list, which is a little bit different.\
\
Chelsea Clarke [00:15:36]:\
Yeah. So if you're already following those main legal aspects of having a website, then you're already going to be covered when you go to sell it. Because when you sell your website, you're selling everything that goes with it and they take over everything. And you have a legal document. If you go through me and I help you sell, I provide all these legal documents between you and your buyer so that you're both covered and it states exactly who owns it and what that transfer encompasses. So if you're already following email laws, you're okay. When you have that transfer, the buyer essentially becomes they are the business now. So there's nothing extra that you have to do. As long as you just have those legal clauses in your sale agreement, then everything's covered. And you don't actually have to send out an email blast and say, oh, I'm no longer here. There's actually a lot of companies that will buy a website and they will continue to pretend to be that person, and it's part of the agreement. And there's actually a lot of really big bloggers out there who sold a long time ago. And it's a big secret that a corporation actually is still running their website, the pictures on the website, and they're sending out emails every week as if they are this.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:16:51]:\
Yeah. And so you need to be okay with that if that's something you're going to take. But you do have to with the new law in California CCPA, and again, not legal advice, you are going to have to on your privacy policy, you're going to have to notify California residents and give them the right to opt out of having their information be sold. And that just went to effect in January.\
\
Chelsea Clarke [00:17:11]:\
In January.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:17:12]:\
So this month that we're recording right now. So that may be a little less known, but there's a little tweaks in sort of the agreements and stuff that you're having to do to your yeah.\
\
Chelsea Clarke [00:17:20]:\
And you want to put all of that information in your original privacy policy page on your website as well.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:17:26]:\
Yes, exactly.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:17:27]:\
So make sure that's in there. So I just wanted to touch on that because that is a new thing.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:17:33]:\
Okay.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:17:36]:\
So you put it up for sale. Do you fill out a form that shares your information? Do you put together like a presentation that's like the information on your site and the conversion rates and the money and all the information we've discussed? What does the for sale sign look like? A house is like the picture of the interior. What does it look like for a blog?\
\
Chelsea Clarke [00:17:58]:\
It's exactly like flipping a house. You want to have all of your information out there. You're going to want to have a profit and loss sheet. This is just a standard spreadsheet that shows how much you make each month, where that money is coming from, like who's paying you and how much you're spending every month. And that is your PNL statement. And that's something that every buyer is going to want to see. They're also going to want to see your Google Analytics so you can add them to your Google Analytics just so that they can have view access, just check for themselves to make sure that what you're saying about your traffic is true. And they can just verify that. You'll also want to have pictures. So pictures of your social accounts, snapshots of how many followers you have on Instagram, things like that. All of these little tidbits, a snapshot of how many email subscribers you have. You just want to paint the picture of what it's like for someone so they can easily just read the info and imagine themselves owning that website just like they would if they were buying a house.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:19:00]:\
Okay, no, that's a great point actually, on that point, because when you stage a house, you want to take out the pieces of you, right?\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:19:10]:\
Like that. You always see that. I don't know how many people know that. Maybe I just watched too much HTV. And I've heard of bloggers that when they are looking to put their blog for sale, they try to kind of take their personal aspect out of it. To what extent do you recommend that? Do you really have to do that? Kind of what?\
\
Chelsea Clarke [00:19:31]:\
Yeah, it's really your own personal choice. I do recommend removing yourself as much as you can just because when someone takes over your business, everything that they get that day that they take over ownership is theirs. That means that if your face is on the blog, they own that picture, your name, they could continue using your name. So if you don't remove it before or you don't state in your sale agreement that you're not okay with that, they have full reign to run the business with your face still there and your name. So your name will always be attached to that and it's out in the world. So I always say, no, just remove your personal name, your family's name, your pictures, just make it so that it's morestuffnonymous, just for your own privacy. Because ten years down the road they could sell it to someone else and you'll have no control over that stuff.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:20:25]:\
Does a blog, sales wise, look more attractive if it's more about the blog brand as opposed to the personal brand?\
\
Chelsea Clarke [00:20:30]:\
Yeah. And it really depends what your niche is and what you're selling. If it is a blog where it's your personal opinions and your personal reviews of things, then it does help to have a picture and a name. But the thing is you don't have to use your real name when you go to sell. You can just swap it for a different person's name and swap your photo for a stock photo of someone else if you have the right to use that photo. Because, yeah, you can protect your privacy that way and it can still look like it's a real person to anyone coming to view the blog, but you yourself have stepped out of it. So that's what I recommend doing.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:21:09]:\
Yeah, I would also try to be upfront about that if you're like. I'm using a different name for this because there was a whole scandal in the personal finance space two years ago about Drew Cloud who turned out to not be a real person but was quoted in tons of articles and looked to as an expert. And so, I mean, it's a little different if you're just like changing, but if you're kind of starting from that place, I'd be upfront about whatever, the actual expertise, because you don't want to be portraying something you're not necessarily to a certain extent, there's a difference.\
\
Chelsea Clarke [00:21:43]:\
Yeah. There's definitely an ethics thing that will come into it. And I think you really have to just think about what you're comfortable with. If it feels wrong to you, then it probably is. So just always in whatever type of business you're in, just do it the right way. Just be cool.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:21:58]:\
Yes. I like that. Okay, so you've got it up for sale. Ideally, you probably get multiple offers. Right. And maybe like selling a house. I mean, I've never actually sold a house, but I watch a lot of HGTV. Does that tend to happen? We get multiple offers. What does that look like?\
\
Chelsea Clarke [00:22:18]:\
Yeah. So when you're selling your blog, you always hope that you'll get multiple offers. If you're putting it up for auction, you could get multiple bidders, which is great if you're putting it up with a broker. It really just depends how good your content is and if the right buyer is seeing it at the right time. So there's really no way to tell you. "Yes, you are going to get so many buyers and bidders and interest on it." It's always going to be personal to the website and the person.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:22:48]:\
Yeah. And I mean, those bids or offers could be above or below your asking price I guess.\
\
Chelsea Clarke [00:22:54]:\
That's right. Yeah. Your asking price is just a median and you should be prepared that you will be negotiating because, yeah, you're probably going to sell a little bit under, but I've definitely worked with people who've ended up selling for more because there has been more interest and more buyers fighting it out over it.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:23:14]:\
Yeah.\
\
Chelsea Clarke [00:23:16]:\
Sorry, go ahead.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:23:17]:\
I was just going to say don't be scared to ask for something and don't be scared to negotiate.\
\
Chelsea Clarke [00:23:22]:\
Right.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:23:24]:\
And actually, Jamie Lieberman, who did the talk on trademarks and copyrights, offered, a negotiation worksheet. So if you need to get a little more comfortable with that, her free offer was negotiation worksheet. That might help.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:23:34]:\
That might help. Yeah.\
\
Chelsea Clarke [00:23:35]:\
Yeah, always negotiate. Never accept the first offer. And you know, it's your baby. You built that website, you ran it. Those are your words. You don't have to sell it for anything less than you're comfortable with.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:23:48]:\
Yeah. Walk away if it's not what you want. That's okay. And I had interrupted you. I think you covered what you were going to say.\
\
Chelsea Clarke [00:23:58]:\
Yeah, I got to that.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:24:00]:\
Okay. So you might get multiple offers and stuff, and then there is a contract in place. There should be a lot more contracts in blogging than there are, unfortunately, I feel like, for most people. So contract, read it, hire a lawyer to look through it, just so that you understand what all you're selling and what you're agreeing to.\
\
Chelsea Clarke [00:24:20]:\
Yes, 100%. That is so important. And if you are working with me. The contract was written by my lawyer and she and I can answer questions at any time, too. And you're always encouraged to reach out to your own lawyer and your own team always for anything before signing anything.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:24:37]:\
Yes, absolutely. And then how does the money work? Because it is an online world, it could be a large sum of money.\
\
Chelsea Clarke [00:24:47]:\
Escrow. Always escrow? Yes, always. PayPal does not protect sellers. It's just, oh, God, I've heard horror stories. And Escrow protects you. And what Escrow is, it's just an online service. You can do it yourself. You can have a broker do it. You put your money into this third party account, you send the website to your buyer, and then when they check everything out and they agree to it, then they can release that money to you. So if you're buying a website, you get that protection as well. It just protects both parties. If there's any ever a problem, there is a person at Escrow that can work with you to work it out, and you're just so. Oh, I always see people, they're like, "Oh, I'll just use PayPal. It's easy." It's like, "Oh, just don't"\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:25:38]:\
It's like, oh, just don't it's not insured. It's not no.\
\
Chelsea Clarke [00:25:41]:\
Yeah, exactly.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:25:42]:\
We have a session on that too. We have a session where like an accountant is like, don't use it.\
\
Chelsea Clarke [00:25:50]:\
Costs are actually similar, if not sometimes less, to use Escrow than PayPal, so you have no excuse.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:25:57]:\
Yeah, I understand why bloggers use PayPal for certain things. Sometimes it's the only way to pay affiliates depending on what you're using. Yeah, there's totally reasons why you use it.\
\
Chelsea Clarke [00:26:07]:\
But a big sale like your website.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:26:11]:\
Don't do it. And try to use it more as a pass through account than as your only business checking because it's not really bank. Okay, so Escrow is how you work that out and then once you send everything, you're done. How does that work?\
\
Chelsea Clarke [00:26:32]:\
Yeah. So you'll want to make sure that you send them everything. So the website files, the domain transfer, the social accounts, the email list, anything. If you have courses, maybe it's your teachable account or your Podia account, whatever it is.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:26:48]:\
Okay, it's a question because you're likely paying for teachable, you're paying for Podia, you're paying for plugins sometimes. How does that work in terms of the annual subscription comes up?\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:27:01]:\
Yeah.\
\
Chelsea Clarke [00:27:01]:\
So unless the buyer wants to take over those plugins, they can. They could just take over the account and change the payment info to their own, or you can do that for them.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:27:17]:\
Yeah, but like a Teachable account or a Podia thing.\
\
Chelsea Clarke [00:27:20]:\
Yeah. So something like that, you can do the same thing, like, just take it over and change it to your own name and your own payment. And I have done that before, but since I already have my own Podia account for my other courses, a lot of the time. I will just use my own account if it's something that I'm going to merge into my own business somewhere else. But yeah, you can always change your name, change their name, change their payment to your own. But personally, I like to just start fresh. I'll start a new Podia account and I'll just bring everything over and then close the other one. That way I know I have that peace of mind that it's just me from the start and I start and.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:28:02]:\
That'S when you buy it. But when you sell it, do you just go in, like, delete your payment information yeah. To make sure you're not being charged after you've sold it. Right, because, I mean, you don't like that's kind of yeah.\
\
Chelsea Clarke [00:28:15]:\
You would never just give any of your accounts with your credit card information on it. You would never do that. So you would have to work it out. And this will be between it really depends on what you and the buyer's deal is. It'll be different for everyone, but yeah, I would always say yeah. So you should remove your payment information and anything personal when you give it over to them and then they can just fill in their own information.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:28:37]:\
Okay, got you.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:28:40]:\
Is there like a resource somewhere that kind of is like, remember to check all this stuff for your personal information before you sell it.\
\
Chelsea Clarke [00:28:47]:\
Yeah, and that's actually included in my free offer, which we'll talk about later. But...\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:28:53]:\
I feel like there's a lot of places that I'd be like...Because especially if you started like years ago and you've been at it for I can only imagine how much stuff.\
\
Chelsea Clarke [00:29:01]:\
Exactly, yeah, you'd be surprised when you start looking. You've probably got affiliate accounts all over the place, but you don't have to give away your affiliate account either. I do want to say that they can just set up their own affiliate account and add in their own link. And I always recommend use the Pretty Links plugin, it's free. It's a really easy way to keep track of your affiliate link so that when you sell something, your buyer can just change the link once and it changes everywhere. It makes it a lot easier.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:29:27]:\
Yeah. Pretty Link or a tool like it I use Lasso, which is a paid plugin, but it also shows me how I've optimized pages for affiliate links. So it's got some features especially, and it tracks in my Google Analytics, too. Which I'm sure that potential Buyers would be interested in seeing. "Okay, well, how many actually clicks are they getting? How much is it converting?"\
\
Chelsea Clarke [00:29:46]:\
Yes.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:29:46]:\
I feel like when you're selling, the more data you can provide, the better would be my guess.\
\
Chelsea Clarke [00:29:51]:\
Absolutely! Yeah. The more transparent you can be and the more information you can provide. It makes it a lot easier. And you're going to have more offers and just giving the buyers more information about what the business is because you run it, it all makes sense to you. But for someone who just found out about it, they have no idea.\
\
Chelsea Clarke [00:29:57]:\
Makes it a lot easier. And you're going to have more offers and just giving the buyers more information about what the business is because you run it, it all makes sense to you. But for someone who just found out about it, they have no idea.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:30:11]:\
Yeah, no, that makes sense.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:30:13]:\
Okay, I'm trying to think if I had other questions on this topic that I wanted to ask you. Is there anything we haven't covered? Do you feel like in terms of what it looks like to sell and how to get going on that?\
\
Chelsea Clarke [00:30:25]:\
I think something that a lot of people sort of it stops them from wanting to sell is they worry about the tech side of it, like how to actually get their website to someone else. And actually it is really easy. There's even a free plugin called Migrate Guru Plugin, which makes it really easy to just transfer from one hosting account to another. And I mean, people think, oh, that there's going to be so much back and forth and it's really not. And you'll be surprised. It's really easy to do a domain transfer too, if you've never done it before. It's as simple as logging into the new registrar, initiating the transfer by clicking a button, paying the $9 or whatever it is, and then away it goes a couple of days later.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:31:09]:\
It's probably a little like emotionally scary how simple it is. Kind of like when you hand over the keys to your house. It's like, well, once the keys. After all that work, you're like, "Oh, I just had to click a few buttons and it's gone."\
\
Chelsea Clarke [00:31:23]:\
Yeah, no, that's a great point. Yeah, the emotional side of it is huge, especially if it's a blog that you've been running for a long time. You're going to go back and see that content before you sell it and you're like, "Oh, I remember when I wrote that!" or "I was in school," or "I just had my baby," or whatever it is. And it's an emotional roller coaster too, so you kind of have to be prepared for all the different aspects of selling your website. But it's so great when you do sell and that money lands in your bank account and you're like, "Yes!" Because you can move forward, focus on the next thing in your business.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:31:57]:\
I think there's that sense of accomplishment, too, is I built an asset from nothing that I was able to sell for. It's kind of like I built the house, I've got the plot of land and I built the entire house and decorated and did all things and someone bought it and now I get to go do something else now with having made that money. So I think that's amazing. Sorry, I'm just like I can imagine the roller coaster, but yeah, sense of accomplishment once you do sell as well.\
\
Chelsea Clarke [00:32:32]:\
Yeah, absolutely. People are so happy when you've gone through all of that and it's done and you've got your money and you're just ready to move forward.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:32:42]:\
No, I like that. Okay, you already mentioned it. A little bit, but I know you do have a free offer for attendees. You want to tell us a little bit about it?\
\
Chelsea Clarke [00:32:51]:\

I keep using an analogy of selling your house, but there's a lot of little things. There's checking the foundation, there's so many things to I think a course can help and she's a great resource for that. So thank you. Any final words of advice or tips for those attending?\
\
Chelsea Clarke [00:35:22]:\
I think whether you're wanting to sell your blog or you're not, you're just trying to make money with it. People can get really overwhelmed by the sheer amount of work that it takes to run a blog and get it to the point where it's actually becoming your full time business. But I always say do not give up because so many people give up before your blog actually has a shot. And you will be really surprised if you just stick with it. What can happen? It doesn't happen overnight, but it does happen if you stick with it. So just hang in there. And you really do have this.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:35:55]:\
Yeah.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:35:56]:\
You could do it? If I could do it, trust me, anyone can. Like, I take after my mom who walks towards the computer and it crashes. So if I can do it I mean, it may have taken me six months to figure out how to do drop down menu, but if I could do it, anybody can. It really is. It's a persistent thing. Don't bang your head against the wall, but just keep going. You'll get there and hopefully this summit will help. So thank you again so much. I appreciate all of your knowledge, generosity and time.\
\
Chelsea Clarke [00:36:26]:\

Liz Stapleton [00:00:00]:\
Alright, guys. This session with Christi Cooper is going to be essential if you are selling products on your site. So, Christi, welcome, and thank you for take taking the time.\
\
Christi Cooper [00:00:11]:\
Thank you for having me.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:00:12]:\
Yeah. Because we're gonna be talking about design that sells and how to create a sales page that's gonna help convert. You know, because, yes, copy's super important, but design makes a difference too. So can you tell us a little bit about your background and and what we're gonna learn in your session?\
\
Christi Cooper [00:00:29]:\
Sure. Yeah. So I currently, I run Cooper and Heart Creative, and I've been doing that for about 2 or 3 years. But it overall, I have 20 years of design experience, in the industry. And when I got into this, my own business and online space, I got super fascinated with marketing and sales and, like, all the psychology behind it and everything. So I kind of, like, dove in and, you know, I've just been doing sales pages for people and it's been a lot of fun. So I love to talk about it. And then I yeah.\
\
Christi Cooper [00:01:05]:\
That's what I do. I do sales pages and I do websites and brandings.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:01:08]:\
Right. So what are you gonna be covering in your presentation today?\
\
Christi Cooper [00:01:12]:\
Yeah. So like you said, I'm gonna talk about design that sells. So I'm gonna be talking about, specifically, on sales pages, what should be on them to make them more effective. I'm going to be talking about why the design matters, like, what what impact does design have? Because we all know copy is important. We know your offer is important, but what what does design bring\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:01:36]:\
colors and things\
\
Christi Cooper [00:01:37]:\
Yeah. What does design bring to the table and why why does that matter? And then I'm gonna go into, like, common mistakes I see on sales pages and why people should avoid those, and I'm gonna also give, like, just design tips, like, things that people can take and apply to their own sales pages.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:01:55]:\
Okay. Yes. I think I definitely need that. So I'm excited to go ahead and dig in. Yeah.\
\
Christi Cooper [00:02:01]:\
Alright. Welcome to my presentation. Design that sells boost your sales page conversions. I'm Christi Cooper, as you know. I'm a designer and creative strategist. I have 20 years of experience in the design industry, and I currently help coaches, online educators, and service providers up level their brands by creating beautiful conversion focused sales pages and websites that they love. Okay. So this presentation is for you if, 1, you have an offer that doesn't have a sales page yet.\
\
Christi Cooper [00:02:39]:\
So for example, you might have a shop page on your website that maybe you have, a couple of mini trainings or something like that. And people just go there, click it, and go to the checkout and and purchase, your training, and they don't you don't really have a dedicated sales page for that, offer. Or 2, you have an existing sales page, but maybe it's not working as well as you would like. Perhaps you were really excited to launch, a new digital product. You threw together a sales page the best you could at the last minute, but now that you have proven that it's successful, you really want to make sure that it's going to, be optimized in order to create more conversions for you. Alright. Are we on the same page? So sometimes there's confusion about what a sales page is. So I always like to clarify this at the beginning of, my talks.\
\
Christi Cooper [00:03:38]:\
And a sales page is a web page, and it's focused on one goal, to sell a single offer. So this is not a shop page. Like I was saying, like, it's not a shop page on your website that has multiple things that you could buy. It doesn't put multiple items in a shopping cart. It's not a page with links to other things. It doesn't have, social media links. It doesn't have blog links to your Blogger. You know? It doesn't have other stuff on it.\
\
Christi Cooper [00:04:09]:\
It's super focused on selling one thing. So, typically, you see sales pages used in launches or evergreen funnels. So a launch is, what they call an open and closed cart where the offer is only available for a certain amount of time, for, you know, maybe launch a course and it's only available for 5 days or 2 weeks or whatever it is, that would be a launch. There's a lot of, marketing that goes in the front end of a launch. And then opposite of that is an evergreen funnel, what they call an evergreen funnel, which basically just means that that offer is available, all the time. So you have some way to feed traffic to your sales page in this aspect. Maybe it is just a link on your website. Maybe you have a nurture sequence that people go through, email, like, they opt in for something, and then maybe through that sequence, you offer them this offer and send them to the sales page that way.\
\
Christi Cooper [00:05:17]:\
There's there's different ways that you can do that. The sales page is separate from your website. And so what I mean by that is that, technically, it can be in the same place as your website. It can be on the same domain, built on the same software, you know, WordPress, Squarespace, whatever it is. But it doesn't look like a part of your website. So it doesn't have that website navigation. It doesn't have the header with your logo and the links. It doesn't have your footer with the logo and the links.\
\
Christi Cooper [00:05:48]:\
It doesn't have the sidebar, you know, with all of that information there. It doesn't have any of that. It's very focused. So you see sales pages selling courses, digital products, memberships, events. You you can use a sales page to sell all kinds of things. And then sometimes people refer to sales page, and they're talking about a page that's actually part of your website. And you usually see this more with, service providers, you know, you might have a sales page that's on your website that looks like part of your website, and it's selling a specific service offering. And so it follows a lot of the same rules, but not necessarily all of them.\
\
Christi Cooper [00:06:28]:\
But they are similar and people do call them sales pages as well. K. People often ask me, how long should a sales page be? And so the answer is it depends. The length of the page is determined by all of the different aspects of, what's going into your, your sales page and your offer. So you like, what what are you selling? Who are you selling it to? How much is it? What kind of marketing strategy are you using to drive traffic to it? Is it cold traffic, warm traffic, that kind of thing? And then is it like a main offer? Is it like a signature course that you are offering, or is it connected to a main offer? Is it an upsell or a downsell or something along those lines? In general, and like I said, it really can vary, long form sales pages, the ones that you you scroll through, they have a lot of content, Those are generally used for main offers, signature offerings, courses, memberships, all of those things. Memberships can be kind of medium length. Oftentimes, it really depends. These are gonna be more when they're when they're at a higher price point people generally need more information in order to make a buying decision.\
\
Christi Cooper [00:07:49]:\
Shorter sales pages tend to be low price points. You know, maybe it's a $7 trip wire, what they call a trip wire after you someone opts in for your freebie. So you offer a freebie, they get on your email list, and on the next page you offer, hey. Do you want this thing for $7? That's a tripwire, and that you don't need a very long page for that. That's gonna be, short and sweet. People are gonna make a decision pretty instantaneously on that, and so you don't need a long sales page. And then I put very high price points here. That's really relevant to more, service oriented type offers, you know, people don't tend to buy tens of 1,000 of dollars.\
\
Christi Cooper [00:08:31]:\
They don't purchase a $10,000 offer directly from a sales page. Usually, they want to get on the phone with someone. So, those can be shorter sales pages because they're really, they have a slightly different goal. All right, the key elements of a sales page, let's get into the meat of a sales page. So what makes up a sales page? Should cover that. Right? Your offer, obviously. And I just wanna clarify that your offer is not just the thing you're selling, but how you are presenting it and packaging and and giving it to people. So because your offer might be for example, maybe you are, a productivity expert and you have a specific productivity framework that you take people through or you, promote that others do as well and you wanna sell this framework.\
\
Christi Cooper [00:09:23]:\
Right? So you could you could package that in different ways, like, the same core content, but you could, sell it as a video course. Right? Or you could sell it as an ebook, or you could sell it as some sort of, email mini course or something like that. So how you are packaging that offer and and conveying that information to people really does, make up part of your offer. Then, of course, you have your copy, which is the content of the page, and we can't skip over this part. The copy, you know, speaks to your people and tells a story that they connect with. And then 3rd, we have design, which is my specialty, and those are the visuals and they support the copy. They attract your ideal people. They do some other things as well, which I'll talk about a little bit.\
\
Christi Cooper [00:10:18]:\
But first, you wanna start with your content. So good copy really does help you sell. I always recommend you hire a conversion oriented copywriter if you can. If you're at the right, stage in order to make that investment, it is highly worth it. So your copy is going to help you know what the story is on your page is, what the overall vibe and emotional tone of your sales page is, and this will help you with the design aspect of it. And it also helps you establish a framework for your content, before you get on your platform and start designing your sales page. Okay. So here's a little diagram I created. This is actually part of, a freebie that I offer, hold the key elements of a successful sales page.\
\
Christi Cooper [00:11:12]:\
This is not the freebie I'm offering, connected to the summit. So if you do want this, just send me a message somewhere, Instagram, email, where whatever, and I I can get you the link for this if you want it. But I did wanna go over, just briefly what the key elements are so you know what should be on your sales page. Because this is part of the design process. Like, people don't realize that design is not just the pretty stuff, but it's also it's also how, how that content is structured on the page. So first, you want a compelling headline. You wanna hook people in, grab their attention, make them wanna read the sales page. Then you have, a story or a journey or, copy that really connects with what your readers are struggling with and how they can travel from that struggle to the solution.\
\
Christi Cooper [00:12:13]:\
So the solution is the thing that's going to help them transform from that struggle point to that success point, Right? That's what you're offering. And then you're gonna announce your offer. So whatever, it is say if you're selling a course, you know, what the name of your course and how it's going to be, how you have the solution for them right there. Like, you've told them what the solution is and then you're like, and I happen to have it for you. Then you can go into the benefits. So these are the results that people get. This is not the, I get 5 videos and 3 workbooks type of information. This is I will become using the productivity example, I will become more productive and have more time to spend with my kids and walk my dog and watch TV.\
\
Christi Cooper [00:13:07]:\
You know? So it's it's a little bit different. So this is the thing that people want after they use, whatever it is you're offering. You can't forget your call to action, so your CTA. This is your buy button, basically, and, like, the text around it. So very important, otherwise, people can't buy. Then you have the details of your offer. So these are the features of your offer. This is on a course example you get 5 videos, 5 workbooks, and a Facebook community.\
\
Christi Cooper [00:13:40]:\
So those are like the details of what they actually get. Then you have your pricing. So sometimes you might just have one price point and it's really simple, other times you might have some different value tiers, it kind of depends on what you're offering. Scarcity, not every sales page has this, but those that do usually associated with launches. Scarcity in the form of, like, you only have 3 more days to buy this. You know, usually, you see this in timers. Scarcity is good only if it's true. So don't use it if it's not true because that's unethical.\
\
Christi Cooper [00:14:20]:\
So definitely, as long as you have true scarcity, then it can be an effective selling aspect on your sales page. Social proof is super powerful, and I always, like to talk about it. So these are customer testimonials, success stories, that kind of thing. A guarantee is also really valuable in providing reassurance for buyers, you know, it helps to increase trust. A bio. So this is especially with, cold audience traffic or colder audience traffic, you want to reinforce why you are the person they should buy this thing from. Not every page needs this, but sometimes it's helpful to have, like, who this is for, who it's not for, especially people are unclear on, if this is for them or not. So sometimes it's nice to have that that information on there really straight up.\
\
Christi Cooper [00:15:18]:\
And then FAQs. FAQs are super valuable. Answer those commonly asked questions that people ask. Answer their objections to buying, like, will I have time to do this? How much time will it take me to go through this? Those kind of things. Alright. So now my favorite part, sales page design. Why does sales page design matter? So I wholeheartedly believe that good design converts. It helps you attract your audience and stand out from competition.\
\
Christi Cooper [00:15:53]:\
It helps you convey credibility and trustworthiness. It guides your reader on the page. It keeps them engaged with your copy. And it helps you set the emotional tone of the page which helps you sell. Okay. I'm gonna go into each of these a little more. Design helps you attract your audience. So your branding, the design, the visual tone, it all appeals to the people that you want to attract and repels the people you don't wanna attract.\
\
Christi Cooper [00:16:26]:\
Because we are visual creatures, 90% of our information is taken in visually. The design aspect of it really does matter, and it catches your audience eye or it turns them away. So some really obvious examples of this is masculine versus feminine styles. So if you are selling something that is aimed at men, you would not put flowers and scripty fonts and, you know, pinks and purples. You know, like, you wouldn't put that kind of more feminine associated visuals on a product that's more aimed for men to use and vice versa. Like, you wouldn't do a particularly feminine product in a very masculine style. It would just not work. And, you know, you see this in other ways, like corporate versus fun style.\
\
Christi Cooper [00:17:20]:\
So you might have a pretty serious topic or a serious audience and so it it will benefit more from a much more straightforward clean-cut corporate style. Or you might have a very lighthearted audience, maybe your products aimed at moms with kids and crafts and things like that. That that would probably have a more fun style, and it just kind of depends. But you can kind of see how the design will attract your people or repel your people. Okay. So design conveys trustworthiness. It helps you establish trust and credibility. So people always wonder why that is and, where's my fact? There's my fact.\
\
Christi Cooper [00:18:07]:\
Sorry. I was getting just sidetracked. So 75% of people I need to rearrange my bullets here on my presentation. 75% of people judge the credibility of a web page based on how it looks and how the content is presented and not on the content itself. So the way a web page looks is how people decide whether they trust the source or not. So that's super important for credibility. Like, you don't want it to look like, you don't want it to look like a scam offer. You don't wanna look like you don't know what you're doing.\
\
Christi Cooper [00:18:42]:\
You want it to have that baseline credibility across the board. And if you have a strong visual brand and you're using that consistently, it helps maintain trust and memorability as well. And memorability is important, as you know, with attracting your audience. So let's see. Going back up into my middle bullet here, the ugly ugly converts argument, I think, is BS. So there was I don't know that it says common right now, but there was, a little while back, there was this common thread that people would talk about how an ugly sales page converts better than a well designed sales page. And, basically, they were basing this on they didn't have any competition, and they had a very specific audience. They had a very specific following and a very specific offer.\
\
Christi Cooper [00:19:34]:\
So that does not apply across the board to everybody. In general, design helps. You convert more than, than ugly does because, I mean, if you think about it, if you look at other industries, if you look at corporations, you know that design is often the separating factor between 2 competitors. You know, Apple versus Windows is a classic example of that. Design is a focus for Apple, and they make more sales and more profits because of that. And the first impressions make a difference. Like I was saying, 75% of people judge the credibility of a web page based on how it looks, which is crazy. Okay.\
\
Christi Cooper [00:20:21]:\
So what else does a design do on the on the sales page? It helps to keep readers engaged with the page. You caught their attention. Now you need to keep it. You need to guide them through the copy on the page. You don't want them to be hit by a block of copy. You don't want your sales page to look like a blog post article because as much as we like to read blog post articles, I mean, I personally, I still skim them, and I don't necessarily read them all the way through. So think about how you read things and how people have short attention spans. You really can use design to break up the copy and guide them through it.\
\
Christi Cooper [00:21:04]:\
65% of people are visual learners, meaning they take and think much better when there are visual supporting the copy and not just straight copy. It helps you to highlight key pieces of the copy. So, if you have callouts of certain phrases or sentences, if you highlight keywords, things like that, they can really help, to keep readers interested and really catch their eyes as they scroll down the page. It keeps them from being overwhelmed. Like like I was saying, like, from those big blocks of copy, you don't you don't want them to to just be, like, okay. I don't have time to read this and click away. You you want to keep them engaged. Okay.\
\
Christi Cooper [00:21:50]:\
And lastly, design sets the emotional tone of the page. So we like to think that we use logic when we make buying decisions. But, actually, we buy based on our emotions and how we feel about something, and that all comes from our intuition, our subconscious. And there was a neuroscience study that I was reading that said 95% of our decisions, including purchase decisions, take place in our subconscious. So it's what our, gut feeling is, basically, and then we justify those decisions with logic after we've made that decision. So the feeling of a page is really influenced by the design and the visuals. They really set the tone and the mood of the page much more strongly than words do, like the words kind of come second there. So that's why you need design to support the words on the page.\
\
Christi Cooper [00:22:56]:\
When you have copy that also speaks to emotions and you have design that supports that emotion tone that you're trying to convey, they can be very, they can be a very powerful combination. Okay. So I put a few examples in here because I know some of you are much more visual. So I wanted to kinda point out how different sales pages can have different feelings, and styles. So, like, the one on the left is bright and colorful and cheery and kind of light hearted. You know, it's not it's not very serious even though, you know, she's talking about a serious product in a way, but just her style and her vibe is very fun and lighthearted. Now the one in the middle is not fun and lighthearted, but it's not cold either, but it's definitely got a much more polished look. It's very much, it's a little bit more on the serious side, but not so much that you're turned off as, as a as her audience, would respond to something that's very clean, modern, and polished rather than something that's kind of, like, a little bit too casual.\
\
Christi Cooper [00:24:15]:\
Right? And then on the right, you have something that's very straightforward even though it has colors. The market here is educators and teachers, and so they they're looking for some very structured straightforward information, and they they don't really need that lightheartedness. They don't really need that kind of, polish like in the middle example. So you can see they kinda have some different feelings going on that you just gain from the design visuals. Okay. Now we're getting into some useful stuff. So if you have a sales page, you might want to take some notes. These are some common sales page mistakes that I see a lot.\
\
Christi Cooper [00:25:02]:\
So one of the top ones that I see is a sales page is missing some key information that could really help buyers make a decision. So if you go back to those, the key elements of a successful sales page, they're missing something in there that's really, really key in helping people make a decision. So one of the ones I see is not including enough about the benefits of the offer. So the results and transformation that people will see after they buy it. So don't just tell me I need to buy a productivity course to be more productive because really that's not really what I want. Right? What I want is to buy a productivity course so that I have more time to do things that I like to do, like read a book or play with my kids. So you really want to make sure that you are communicating the results and the transformation that your offer provides. The other thing I see, which is funny, is people don't include enough information about the features of their offer.\
\
Christi Cooper [00:26:12]:\
So I've seen some where they, like, barely touch upon, like, what you get what you actually get when you buy. They're like, oh, yeah. You get, like, a video course and some work books, and, you know, it's like one little bullet point, and it it just doesn't feel like you're getting very much. And especially in this kind of online digital world when you're selling something that is intangible, you want to make it feel like it's much more tangible. So you want to really go into, like, you get module 1, which has a video and a workbook and tells you all about this. And you get module 2 and it has a video and a workbook and it tells you all about this. You really wanna outline all of that stuff in in a way so people can see how much they are actually getting. The other thing that I see missing a lot is testimonials or reviews or success stories or any other social proof that helps you establish credibility and that your offer is something that actually works.\
\
Christi Cooper [00:27:16]:\
People trust other people. So if they see that someone like them had success with your offer, they are much more likely to think, oh, hey. I could have success with it too. I could be just like that. So it's super valuable to have, a lot of really positive testimonials or reviews on your sales page to help people see that your offer really does work for others. And then the other thing I see missing is not addressing common objections. So if you don't address, maybe you have a course and maybe it takes a significant amount of time to complete that course in order for them to see that transformation. If you don't address that objection of, like, well, what if I don't? I don't have enough time.\
\
Christi Cooper [00:28:06]:\
Why why would I buy this? If you don't address that, somewhere, it's usually helpful to address in the sales page. You can address that in other places like email and stuff, but putting it on the sales page just helps to reinforce that, you know, hey. No. Yeah. I totally made it easy for you to make time for this. Like, I've broken it up. I've got a road map for you. You can plan to do it in 1 hour a week or whatever it is.\
\
Christi Cooper [00:28:32]:\
Right? If you address that objection, it's going to be really helpful, and people are like, like, oh, yeah. I guess maybe I could make time for it as an example. Okay. Some other mistakes I see is copy that doesn't connect. So this is headlines that don't hook your reader in. I've seen some that are too, like, generic or vague or, you know, they just don't they don't speak to what your people are struggling with or who your people are. Right? So definitely work on connecting with with what your people are struggling with. So, other things I see is too much industry jargon.\
\
Christi Cooper [00:29:19]:\
You know, industry jargon for me would be like branding and trip wires and all of these things are it's very it's very jargony and not necessarily the words that my people use. So you definitely wanna be conscious of that. Failing to use words that readers use. So maybe you're you're trying to be clever and you come up with clever sayings to communicate things, and that's fine if that's who you are and who your brand is. But if it's not something that your readers say or it's not something that your readers connect with, you're it's gonna fall flat. Not having a story to relate to. So if at all possible, you really wanna communicate either your backstory if it relates to your offer, like, so you can show the transformation or maybe it's a story of someone that you have helped with your offer that kind of showcases that illustration. People really connect with stories.\
\
Christi Cooper [00:30:19]:\
And so if you have a sales page and it doesn't have a story, then it doesn't connect as well. And then I see both sides of this, either a sales page that really is too wordy and too long or it doesn't say enough. So and this can vary a lot with the audience and the offer, but I've seen both of these cases, like, either it's just too much or they just don't have enough to really communicate the information people need. And then, obviously, the other common mistakes that I see is design that repels. So this is design that looks amateur, pieced together, unprofessional. You don't want it you know, you can DIY things and it still look, clean and professional and not, not what I would say is janky. That's kind of a term that I use. You you just want it to you still want it to have a professional feeling even if you have done it yourself.\
\
Christi Cooper [00:31:25]:\
So anything like like that looks 2 pieced together, just unpolished, un and, you know, made it looks a little bit of a mess. I'm sorry. It it just turns people off and it really they just don't trust that that page. Right? So often this can be too many font styles, too many different colors, awkward spacing. So if you have awkward spacing that doesn't keep like a headline with the the bullet points underneath. Like, maybe if there's spacing weird, maybe it's too close, maybe it's too far apart, it can really hinder, reading comprehension. Blocks of copy, like I was saying previously, that aren't broken up or highlighted in in keywords in some way can be, a deterrent. Not making your buy button stand out.\
\
Christi Cooper [00:32:16]:\
I've seen some sales pages that didn't even have buttons that look like buttons. They had, like, text links. So you really wanna make sure that your button stands out and it's clear. And then poor experience on mobile view. So this is also a turn off that repels people, so don't don't forget mobile view. So and this I'm gonna jump on into actionable tips to improve your sales page design. A lot of this is just reiterating, some of the mistakes I talked about, but in a way that, like, these are the things you should do. Right? So I'm kind of flipping that around.\
\
Christi Cooper [00:32:53]:\
So make sure you keep it clean and simple. So choose 1 to 2 fonts, 3 maybe if you have, like, a script accent font or something like that. But just don't use too many. You know, you can use just 1 and just use varying sizes and thicknesses. Choose 3 to 5 colors if you have more color hues, meaning like red, blue, yellow, green, purple, orange, you know, if the more of those, like, strong color hues you have, the harder it is to make it flow. So as a as a designer and I design with a lot of color, I know how challenging it is to make a bunch of different colors work together on a page. So if if you're not a designer, you're not design, inclined, definitely simplify your color palette. Don't don't do too many bright colors.\
\
Christi Cooper [00:33:49]:\
Don't do too just don't do too many colors overall. Don't go crazy with a lot of background images, textures, and patterns. They can just be distracting because remember the design, the job of the design is to support the copy. So when you have, like, background stuff that is a little bit, crazy, like, it distracts from the copy. So remember, you don't wanna distract from the copy. Design a few different styled sections and then duplicate those down the page. It really helps keep the page cohesive and cuts down on your design time. Use white space, left and right.\
\
Christi Cooper [00:34:31]:\
So, like, for example, this presentation I have white space on the left, I have white space on the right. And you wanna use white space between your sections too. So then you have clear, like, here's a block of copy you should read, here's another block of copy you should read. So it's, it feels airy and it's easier for people to take in. Next, you wanna pay attention to your copy. You wanna break up that copy into bite sized scannable pieces. So no big paragraphs here you want, you know, a sentence, a sentence, a a sentence, you know, bullet points, things like that. Something that will help you break up copy is to read it out loud to find natural break points in it.\
\
Christi Cooper [00:35:14]:\
With, your font styling, use 2 to 3 headline, subhead styles and then a body copy style. So don't go don't have too many different like headline sizes and things like that. You if you keep it consistent it'll give you a cleaner look. Use bullet points, use call outs, use, blurbs, you know, like the little 3 columns across or 4 columns across. Definitely use different ways to break up your copy. And then accentuate keywords and phrases. So, like, if you have, like, a sentence and it has, like, a really, juicy juicy word in there that that would stand out to people, you know, like, make more money. You wanna bold that.\
\
Christi Cooper [00:35:56]:\
Right? Or italicize that or, underline that kind of varies or highlight that. Underline, I just say that because sometimes that indicates a link if it's in body copies, so you may not want to underline necessarily. But it can be used to accentuate words as well. And then let's highlight with design elements. So this is bringing in that more visual aspect for visual learners. So use icons to bring attention, help readers visualize what that copy is about, use divider lines to help break up copy sections, use instead of just bullet points, you can use icons for bullet points that kind of add a little subtle message like check marks, you know, these are, this is a positive thing, positive thing, positive thing, or arrows, you know, to bring attention to things. And then when you're using photos, you wanna use photos that either are from your brand or that relate to the copy. But you don't wanna go overboard with a lot of stock photos because that can feel, that can feel a little bit too amateur.\
\
Christi Cooper [00:37:13]:\
And so unless you have, like, a very cohesive stock photo collection or maybe you take your own photos, I don't know, you want your photos to feel as cohesive as possible, so don't when you use a lot of stock photos, sometimes they can just kind of look jumbled together, like they don't really go together. And so that's why I kind of warn against using too many. All right. You also wanna keep conversion in mind. So these are these are things that you just you definitely wanna get right on your sales page. Make your buy button stand out, and that and it can be a bright color. It could just be high contrast on the page. It can be, just a different color from everything else on the page.\
\
Christi Cooper [00:37:54]:\
It could be bigger. You know? Don't make don't make it too small. Just make sure that it stands out from all the other elements around it. Use, especially on a long form page, use multiple buttons on the page. So you and you're going to put these in any place that's a natural place where people would be like, yes. I'm ready to buy this. You know? So that's a good place to put your button in addition to, like, right with your pricing. Use mock up images for digital products.\
\
Christi Cooper [00:38:26]:\
So this really helps people visualize things in a tangible way. So it create makes takes that intangible, information and turns it into a visual that feels tangible. Put, testimonials near your CTA button. So you might have a whole series of testimonials. Put that near one of your key call to action buttons, and it just it has that connection there for people who are like, oh, look. This has worked for others, and there's the button I can just click it. Also, relating to testimonials, use photos if you can. So photos really help people connect with people.\
\
Christi Cooper [00:39:08]:\
So instead of just being text, if you have a photo, people can see their face and that just is like an instant, human connection for them. On the tech side of things, don't forget mobile view, like I said earlier. So when you're checking your mobile view, watch for weird spacing, weird sizing, overlapping elements and then tweak as needed. Speed is important when choosing your tech. So make sure that you have, you know, a good server, that it's it's it's hosting that page in a speed. There's some different things online to check the speed of your page. But definitely, if your page is loading slowly, you can lose people that way. One way you can help your page remain quick is to don't use oversized images.\
\
Christi Cooper [00:40:03]:\
So make sure you use images that are sized for, the location that you're using them and that they're not like 10 times that size. You can compress your images for free using services like tinypng.com, and then there's there's a whole variety of plugins and things like that, but if you can, compress images to help with your page speed. And then don't forget before you put the sales page out there to test your integrations. Make a test purchase. Make sure that they can pay. Make sure it connects to how you're delivering your product, your offer, and your email marketing service. Usually, you you trigger emails that get sent after someone buys. So make sure all of that is working because there's nothing more frustrating than someone being excited to buy something and then being disappointed in the checkout process.\
\
Christi Cooper [00:40:58]:\
Okay. We're almost done. I just wanna do a quick recap. First, remember sales page is focused on one goal, to sell a single offer. Don't forget to structure your content use proven elements of successful sales pages. Remember that design helps your sales page sell. It attracts your audience, it establishes trust, it helps to keep readers engaged with your copy, and it sets the emotional tone of the page. Avoid those common mistakes that I talked about, missing key information, copy that doesn't connect with your people, and design that repels your audience instead of attracts.\
\
Christi Cooper [00:41:42]:\
And then improve your sales page design. Keep it clean and simple. Break up your copy, accentuate and highlight copy. Use design elements to highlight and break up that copy as well, you know, those icons, those blurbs, those kinds of things, and keep conversion in mind. Don't forget your buttons. Don't forget your mobile view, all that good stuff. So thank you so much. I am so grateful for you watching my presentation today.\

**Transcript:**\
[00:00:09.880] - Dan Morris, lettersfromdan.com\
Hey, hey, this is Dan coming to you today talking about affiliate marketing. I don't know if you know my wife Rachel, but Rachel and I run a Blogging Concentrated, which is, I guess, for the last seven years, has primarily been we do 8 hour workshops around the United States and in New Zealand and Canada and some other places besides the United States. But we do 8 hour workshops, teaching, blogging. We teach, I guess you would say digital marketing more than blogging now that blogging is really just a piece of the bigger puzzle. Right.\
\
[00:00:48.690] - Dan\
You can't just write a blog post and then it's over. You've got to do all the other pieces. So, we primarily do that. And then my wife, Rachel, she runs Finding Joy.net, which is a giant motherhood site. It's fifty thousand pages a day. And I think she's said half a million fans on Facebook. And, you know, we do a bunch of stuff with that community. And then the reason for this video is that we also run a two giant products each year.\
\
[00:01:16.950] - Dan\
One is called B.C Stack, which you may have heard of. It's in June, July period, depending on when 4th of July falls. And we do Podcasters Kit in October. And both of them are affiliate products. So, that's what we're going to talk about today, is how how do you use affiliate marketing in your in your blogging universe?\
\
[00:01:38.670] - Dan\
So, we're going to divide affiliate marketing into two two parts to start with. The first part is what if you host, what if you decide to use affiliate marketing to build your business? And then the second part is, what if you decide to use to be an affiliate for someone like to use affiliate to help monetize your business? So, we're going to talk about both of those halves. And you should have and you should have the worksheet. So, the worksheet should just go kind of like right along with the video. And in fact, to be a little more efficient, I made myself like a little outline of the things that I'm talking about. But if we go off, we go, of course, I'm going to adjust my line so that I can create the perfect worksheet.\
\
[00:02:27.360] - Dan\
Okay, so let's talk about hosting. Let's talk about hosting. So that would be a good place to start. So, hosting an affiliate project, I guess call it is what, not talking about hosting like you have your website hosted. I'm talking about what if you put together a product and then you get affiliates to sell your product for you like you're the host of the product and other people do the marketing? All right. That's that's one concept. So, I'm going to does it seem very clear. So, for BC Stack, which happens in June, July, BC Stack.com we do, I guess you would call it. Some people have traditionally called it a bundle. So what we do is we go out and find 65 products and then we put them into one package that we call B.C Stack, and then we sell that to thousands and thousands of people. And then we primarily use affiliates to do the same. Now, for the affiliates, it's- it's money, it's money, right? They make money and then for us, we also make money. But the idea is it grows the list even further because affiliates have lists that you and I don't. So, we have affiliates and in New Zealand and the Philippines, Canada, Europe and all these different places. And they all have spent years and years developing their own lists.\
\
[00:04:05.430] - Dan\
So when they market the product to their list, then we grow our list because everybody comes to our landing page. Right, buys the product, which gets them onto our list. So, then it just grows the list quite, quite large.\
\
[00:04:20.040] - Dan\
So, the the steps in hosting your own affiliate product are. First, you have to have the product and then the pitch, we're going to go through all these and then the software and the landing page and the prizes and then the key. The key to everything is the universal spreadsheet in my mind.\
\
[00:04:44.530] - Dan\
Okay, so the universe for this is what I would like you to do. Now, if you're going to use affiliate marketing or if you're not physically marketing, I would like for you to do this. And that is I want you to figure out. Who are the people in your niche, niche universe, so, you know, like if you're in the if you're in the running world, obviously there's the top runners in the world.\
\
[00:04:44.530] - Dan\
The best runners, the marathoners, the four milers, the triathletes like the best runners. And then down from there are the people who write about write. Right, who probably are past runners like Higdon writes about how to do the three hour marathon or the four hour marathon. And then, you know, there's these top people who write about runners. So, if you are running person. You probably have a bookshelf and it's probably have running books like off road running and how to run downhill, lean forward technique, breathing techniques like all the stuff in the running world. Right? And then there's races and there's there's race directors who run these big races like the Boston Marathon. And then there's people who make movies about running like Prefontaine. So, there's an entire world around. Right.\
\
[00:06:05.450] - Dan\
So, what I would like you to do is to make a spreadsheet of all the people it doesn't necessarily have to be categorized by. Here's all the best running books and the authors of those books. Here's the best writing movies and the directors and writers of the movies. Here's the top runners. Like you don't have to- I mean, when I started, I had columns for each particular place that I found the top people in the niche. But I've discovered it doesn't really matter. What you really need is just a list. You need to create the list.\
\
[00:06:34.700] - Dan\
Now, there are top people in the running world, right? So I get the Olympics. When the Olympics needs a commentator for the running section, they go to the top people in the world, like the last person who won the Olympics last time or whatever. So, who are those people? And my contention is that until those people know who you are, you're not the top people in the running world. You're not top in your niche. So, you need to figure out who what does it look like? Who are the players?\
\
[00:07:04.610] - Dan\
Right. So, that's the first thing you've got this spreadsheet. You've got all here's all the players. Here's all the people. And then those people second step is you've got to figure out of those people who has like if you're going to do like a BC Stack who has a product or could create a product around that idea. So, now you've got two lists; the list of the top people in the running world and then a sub list of just of all of those people who has the product. Right.\
\
[00:07:35.350] - Dan\
So, now you've got the list laid out of who you're going to reach out to, because those are the people who have the audience for the running world. Now, this works for quilting, sewing, underwater basket weaving, saving money, finance. It doesn't matter. Everybody's got a niche. There's a there's a spreadsheet you can make. Here's the top players. Here's Dave Ramsey, Suze Orman. Here's the top people in the money world- Pat Flynn. So, make the spreadsheet right.\
\
[00:08:05.230] - Dan\
So, now you know who you're going after. These are the people with the big lists, like they either have the big Facebook page, they have the big Twitter, they're the big Instagram. They have a big list. These are the people you want promoting your product.\
\
[00:08:20.120] - Dan\
So, now you need to pitch. Pitch is, you've got to figure out what is your product, what is that you're selling? Why would anyone care and how does it help them? How does selling your products help Dave Ramsey? Right. That's a tough. He's got his own products, his own team, his own universe, you know, like four million square foot building. Like, why would it matter to him to sell you a product? All right. So, we got to figure out your pitch. What is it about it that makes them that? Then you've got to have a page, because traditionally when you do a pitch like here's what we do now, we're seven years into BC Stack. So, when I pitch people to be part of the product or to be an affiliate for the product, I can say, "Go to this website and you can see what we've done the last seven years. But the first year you can't do that. So you just have to be persuasive. You have to be you have to understand what it is you're doing. You have to be to talk about it eloquently. You've got to know what the benefit is going to be."\
\
[00:09:23.390] - Dan\
Right now, the benefit is often money. In your pitch, the benefit is we're selling a hundred dollar product and an affiliate, you get 50% of the sales or you get 70% or you get 100%, depending on who who you're going after. So and there's no rule for that. Like, if I was going to go after Dave Ramsey, I would say, "Look, we're selling a hundred dollar product and if you market for us, we'll give you a hundred dollars for each sale." I'll decide. I take no money for this because I'm just going to he's going to grow on my list. Huge. I'll make the money next year. But I need a big hook to catch a big fish. So, smaller people, you might be able to say, you know, we're giving 50%. I don't mean smaller people. But, you know, Oprah is not the same as Tom Smedley, guy who's got a little website that gets 10 visitors a day. You know, they're just not the same. So, you got to have your people you're going to go after and then you've got to have your pitch. And then you've got to be able to tell them the benefit and then you need software, so we use A Member, there's Member Mouse.\
\
[00:10:31.110] - Dan\
There's- there's a lot of different software for managing an affiliate program. Basically, the software is is the thing that spits out the special link for each person so that when they use the- when they market your product and they have a special link, it gets tracked and they get they get paid.\
\
[00:10:48.390] - Dan\
So, you do need software, there's no way of getting around. Oh, wait there is a way to get around. You could create a separate landing page for every single person. So you go to Bloggingconcentrated.com, slash A, slash B, C, D, and whatever sales come out of, each one goes to that specific person. There's no way in the world I would consider doing it. But you. But it's possible you could do that. So, I would use software and A-member is what we use. I think it's a little bit clunky and I think I would like to switch at some point, but I don't know what that would be, what I would be switching to figure that out, because it's worked. It's worked. We've never have had a problem.\
\
[00:11:33.240] - Dan\
So, then so you have the software to pitch the people and then you need the landing page. Right. The landing page is basically the sales page. You've got to have a place that you can sell the product. So sometimes it helps to have the landing page built before you pitch people. Would you like to be an affiliate or would you like to be in the product? Because they some people are visual. They like to be able to see what it is. On the very first, one might make sense to have a landing page. This is what it's going to be. Your name is going to be here or this is what you're going to be selling. Here is the buy button like? It might make sense, but if you suck in design, then I would go strictly on the pitch and I wouldn't show you something in case they look at it and be like, "I don't think I want to do that." So make up your mind whether you want to have a landing page ahead of time or not.\
\
[00:12:25.350] - Dan\
And then it helps to have a set of prizes. So, the top affiliate gets an extra hundred dollars, gets an iPad with BC stack. We give away $40,000 in prizes. So, the first person gets I think last year 15,000, or 20,000, second person got ten, the third person get five, three to one. And then we had like top prize for Wednesday, an extra thousand top prize for Thursday. There's a lot of- there can be a lot of money involved and the more you get is- I've learned this- the more you give out doesn't necessarily mean you're going to get more people. I don't know why that is like my brain thinks. If we give away 20 thousand dollars, wouldn't everyone want to show up, but it doesn't really work that way. There's a magic number. I don't know. The magic number is. My guess is that if the top prize is around seven, that's a pretty quality number to attract the big fish. I don't think eight attracts more big fish than seven or nine or 10. We started at 20. I think it was a mistake because I think we could have got the same result at end. But now that is out there. This is what we do. So, I feel like I'm stuck with it. But I also wanted to create a long term. Like every year people know that's what happens. So, I don't know prizes, people like prizes.\
\
[00:13:49.130] - Dan\
And the prize doesn't necessarily need to be part of the pitch. The prize actually works during the week sales. When you post on your group or on Facebook or wherever the leaderboard, and then you keep flashing the prize and people can see how close they are to it. So they send another email out, they get a little bit competitive. They want to go after it. That's when the prize actually kicks in to help you make more sales.\
\
[00:14:14.630] - Dan\
So, if you're going to host your own product first, you need the product, right? Then you need the universal spreadsheet so you know who you're going to pitch. Now, you could certainly just go with your- the people that, you know, like all the people in your world or in your Facebook group or whatever. But I'm going to tell you right now, if you do that, there's going to be a lot incest, meaning there's going to be a lot of people whose lists overlap with other people's lists. So, when everyone markets, you know, there's going to be a third of the people are going to get a message about your product from like nine, 10, 20 different people.\
\
[00:14:47.840] - Dan\
Now, my theory has been if I find product- people who have products or people who are going to be affiliates as far away from me as possible, then I'm going to have the most unique lists, because all of these people are going to have- you know, the people in Malaysia who have listened to people in India. Their lists are completely different than the people in the United States. So, I get the most eyeballs on the landing page.\
\
[00:15:15.950] - Dan\
So, did we cover all those things? Product-pitch-software-landing page-universe- prizes. Okay, I want to add something that I just remembered. Test.\
\
[00:15:26.690] - Dan\
Okay, so. Once the sale begins and you have all these affiliates, you're going to start to see your conversion, your conversion rate. How do you get your conversion rate? Well, you go if you want, you can go to Google Analytics and you can see how many people came to the page and you can go to PayPal and see how many people bought the product. And then the number of people who bought the product divided by the number of who went to the page is how many- what percentage of your pages converted. Right. So, if hundred people went to your product and only 10 people buy a product. Then you have a 10% conversion. I think that you should try to get to 18% which is always our goal. So. Sometimes you got to after the first day, if you're percentages like seven percent, you got to start testing, which means you got to you got to change the headline, you got to change something.\
\
[00:16:18.960] - Dan\
If you change too many things, you have no idea it worked. So, sit down with your team wife, your husband, your business partner, and figure out, all right, what would be something we could change that would big if we could change right now and then press, publish and mark the time like 3:33 AM Tuesday morning. All right. It's live and then you start taking the steps from that moment forward again so you can see did it make- did it make any difference. And try to by the end of the week get to 18%. Ours is a week, so yours might be longer than a week. You might have a long time, you could test it out, which would be great, but we get all of our traffic in one week, so we got to test regularly through the week until we have this perfect product.\
\
[00:17:04.570] - Dan\
Okay, so that's the host side how to do it. Now, I'm hoping that on your worksheet you can see that. Do you. I'll write, do you have this. And if you don't these are your actions, this is what you need to get, right. This is what you need to work.\
\
[00:17:23.200] - Dan\
Now, the other side of the prop of the equation, which you need to be good at, whether you're hosting the product or being affiliate, is affiliate marketing. And that is, maybe you do this already, you're an affiliate for Amazon, you get a link and you put the link on Facebook and you sell the product or whatever. But if you're going to have people being affiliates for your product, you need to be able to teach them how to be an affiliate. All right. And I learned this because in the first year that we did this, there were a few people who chose to be an affiliate and they bought ads that drove people back to the page and they made like no money. And that's not a fault of the page or the ads. I'll explain that.\
\
[00:18:08.390] - Dan\
So, there are four parts to being the affiliate, the person who's actually selling the product. So, you're going to be doing this for your own product. You're going to be your own athlete, and then other people are going to be doing it for your or you're going to be doing for someone else. So, you still need to know how to how this works.\
\
[00:18:24.530] - Dan\
So, three things that I that I think are important are; honesty, authenticity and presell. And these are totally different things. Even though honesty and authenticity sound the same, they're totally different.\
\
[00:18:39.350] - Dan\
Okay, so we're going to start with authentic. I'm going to put number one here so I can write this worksheet, correct? Okay, now being authentic, if you're. This doesn't mean like being yourself or being honest or being truthful. Those are not authentic. You know, authentic is the practice of understanding who your audience is and then making sure that everything you do is to benefit that audience. But also everything that you do is based on you benefiting your audience for your own benefit. Explain what that means. You're in the running, right? Why, I don't know, it just came up twice, so you're in the running and you're going to do a big promotion, so you decide to give away twenty five dollar Amazon gift cards for anybody who will fill out the survey. Right. Well, who shows up to get a twenty five dollar Amazon gift card? Everybody, I shop if you're going to do a menopause survey for a $20 gift card, I'm going to take the menopause. Why? Because I want a $25 gift card. So the moment that you give away a $25 gift card to Amazon, you have blown your authenticity. It's out the window. All you have to do is you have to figure out what you're going to do a survey, you got to figure out what would entice only runners to take the survey. Right. So, maybe it's a. Twenty five dollar gift card to a running store, right to New Balance.com. New Balance.com/running. So then like, I don't want a $25 gift card to menopause results.com, I'm not going to fill out that survey. That is not of interest to me. So, you need to make sure that your prize for filling out a survey has directly related to drugs because that becomes your audience right in your list and those are the people that you're going to be selling other people's products to. So, once it's not related to running, then all of a sudden your clickthrough rate goes down, you're unsubscribes go down nobody's paying attention on Facebook because you weren't authentic. You didn't create an environment where only runners your show so, they can talk about their questions and answers and feel safe in that environment; you haven't built that. You're no longer an authentic market.\
\
[00:21:18.770] - Dan\
Okay, so now if you're doing affiliate marketing, any of you have done this, you have been authentic, you've been only working in the running niche, you've only done things that would benefit them. You've only built lists of people who are interested in that. Then you want to find running products that you can talk to your list about as an affiliate. You want to find a running book, you want to find a running movie that you can talk about. Some of them will make you money and some of them won't. You have to be to the point where, yes, I want my audience to see this movie. I don't care if I'm making money, I'm going to promote it. And then you got to find other products that actually make you. Because the second part is honesty. You have to be at all times, I am the person that you want to go to to learn about running or to learn about blogging or to learn about finance. So, I'm going to tell you which movies you don't want, which movies you do need to watch, which books you do need to read, which books you don't need to read. I'm going to be that person. I'm going to be honest with my audience.\
\
[00:22:20.410] - Dan\
So, with your affiliate marketing, you've got to find products that totally fit that path of honesty. So, if if you were in the blogging world, like the blogging niche and you saw BC Stack, BC Stack has got sixty five courses, classes, memberships, all about blogging, then I would think this would be perfect for your audience because now they can learn about all these different topics for one tiny little price. Right. This would help your audience immensely because sixty five different things all have to do with building a better, a better blog. And then at the same time, because your audience needs it and you can talk about it honestly. You also make money from it as the affiliate. So, you have to be super honest. You if you don't think your audience needs that, then you should be able to say, I don't think you guys need this. And hopefully that means the next thing that you tell them about that they do need, you're even more believable or they understand, like "Hey, the last time you saved me some money and told me not to get that because that was a waste of time." But now he's saying I should get this, but it must not be a waste of time, because not only if it is a waste of time, you tell him not to get it. So you become that actual honest voice to your audience.\
\
[00:23:39.310] - Dan\
And then when you're actually decided, "I built this great audience and now I'm going to sell a product." If you want to make money like you actually want to be a successful affiliate, you have to be. Like this is called the presell, you have to you have to send a message that sells the product before they get to the page. So, some people who were "We tried to teach BC Stack over the years, some people have said, hey, I found this great deal, it's sixty five products for thirty nine dollars. I think you should check it out, click the link." Now, that means that you've basically taken your audience and you've given them something that you're curious about and willing to go look at it. Now, My landing Page is not designed to persuade you to buy it. It's like, "Okay, here's BC stack, here's all in it, and here's the buy button."\
\
[00:24:39.200] - Dan\
So, if an affiliate doesn't presell, like, tell me exactly what I need and all those things, then the page doesn't work. You don't make any money. So, if you're going to be an affiliate, you've got to go look at the page. Right. You've got to go look at the page that you're sending traffic to, you have to look at all the benefits you've got and hopefully you bought it or you know it or you've got information on it. You've got to see what the page is missing. Right. And then when you're telling about the product to your audience, you have to tell them everything here is who it's for. Here's who it is not for. Here's how long it will take to do it. Here's what you will learn. Here's why I think you should get it. Here's why I think you shouldn't get it. If you're you know, if you're X, Y, Z, I don't think you need this because like all those things, it should be you should totally be able to sell the product because you get it. You know who it's for. You know, it's not for, you know, the benefits. If it's something that comes in the mail, you know how it arrives, you know how long it takes. If it's a course, you know how long it will take them to get to the meat of the course, how long will take them to get the benefit of the course. Like you put that all in your message and then you say, "If this sounds like you, if this is exactly what you need, then click and go buy." Right. Then they go to the landing page and they don't have to be pretty sold. They don't have to depend upon- you don't to depend upon somebody else's landing page to make the sale. I hope that makes sense.\
\
[00:26:07.790] - Dan\
So, as an affiliate to to be an affiliate one, you want to either have somebody who has a list that's totally authentic list, or you want to find people who find people with authentic. Meaning, that's all- that's all you've seen them do. You haven't seen the market YouTube products one day and then a finance product the next day and then some Walgreens thing that they did a sponsored post for the day after that. Like what kind of audits have they built? Ridiculous. And if that's you and that's what you've done, then I would say you need to for 2021, for 2022 whatever you need to figure out. You need to figure out yourself. You got to figure out what is it you're building, what kind of an audience are you building, what kind of product list? If you're not building an audience that's all focused on one thing, then how are you going to sell to them? How are you going to not sell to them like unsell to tell- them things they don't need? Because obviously they won't even think they're on the ROI list of them, not on there for the right reason.\
\
[00:27:10.320] - Dan\
Now, for some of you who are lifestyle bloggers, who write about raising kids and saving money and best fashion and coupons or whatever lifestyle, so you still have one focus, right? You don't teach Spanish. You're not teaching world currencies like you have a focus. And that focus might be women in who have kids from basically from 3 to 16. That might be your your people. So, as long as your "people" fall in that you've got an authentic list. It doesn't matter if you're talking about those different very topics within that niche. Your people become the niche. Moms with little kids to older kids that's my niche. So you can talk about anything in the area. So, then when you talk to them, you can say, hey, if you're a mom of a 15 year old, you don't need this product. But if you're a mom with a three year old, you do need this product. See what I mean? So, when you're talking to audience, you can totally relate to them. So, make sure that you find people who have what you need to grow your list, because as the person who's hosting the product, you also need to be authentic.\
\
[00:28:17.160] - Dan\
So, you don't need if you're selling a broad product, you don't need someone in the running niche to send an email out to their running community to see if anyone out there is a blogger. Like you don't actually need that. I mean, it sounds it sounds enticing, but you don't really need that. You just need people who've built a business on bloggers or on runners. That should be your world.\
\
[00:28:41.760] - Dan\
I just bumped the table.\
\
[00:28:41.760] - Dan\
Okay, so I'm hoping that makes sense. There's two sides to affiliate market. The first side is posting the product and then finding affiliates to actually sell the product for you. And then the second site is, being affiliate and you're either selling other people's products or you're selling your own product to make money for your audience. And hopefully- on the second part, if you're an affiliate on your worksheet, if you're trying to sell products to other people, I've listed in the presell, the things that you need to have in every blog post or every message about the park so that you can accurately you know, you can actually presell and get people to want to buy it before they click a button. So, that would be your action item, is to find something that you can you can sell and then go out and write all the information about that product. Do it once. Find something on Amazon and then go through this list and write a blog post, all of those things in the blog post about that one product and then see if you can sell it. That would be great.\
\
[00:29:45.540] - Dan\
Otherwise, we would love to have you as an affiliate, at BCstack.com. We actually teach an eight hour course on how to do that. It's about eight minutes long course, there's a lot involved. There's a lot more than than just this is the nuts, nuts and bolts. But each one of those things has 20 tasks. So, we'd love to have you take a look at that if you're interested in doing a product.\
\
[00:30:13.030] - Dan\
Otherwise. Good luck with your blogging world, hoping that everything that you're doing is actually creating an income. And it's what's providing the food on your table at your house. Rachel and I have been doing this for ten years, eight years, nine years, somewhere down there, full time. We work from home. We make all our money basically through PayPal, which is kind of crazy because putting all your eggs in one basket. I might actually change that now that I said that out loud. She runs Findingjoy.net. Through that- through the authenticity of creating a motherhood site where she only talks to moms we got the attention of Penguin Random House and she got a book deal a couple of years ago and did the Today Show and all that stuff. It all came because she focused on one thing.\
\
[00:31:07.120] - Dan\
Now, like I said before, you might focus on a lot of things within that one concept, but she focused on that one concept. So, we're probably going to work on another book this year, maybe. I think we might pitch out another book. But we didn't hit the New York Times bestseller for the first book, so I haven't quite figured out if I want to make a run with the first book again and really go nontraditional and try to become a New York best seller like three years after it's published, which is possible. Or if we're going to go for a second book, we're just not sure on that yet. And then Blogging Concentrated, which I think or changing the name to Audience Industries is now- the covid thing kind of made it difficult this year to do workshops, but I imagine going to start doing virtual workshops in 2021. And look forward to seeing all of you there.\
\
[00:31:59.470] - Dan\
I wish you the most sincere and best look. And if there's anything that we can do ever to help you in your journey, we're at Free Weekly Mastermind Group on Facebook or Unconcentrated. So thanks for spending your time with us.\

**Transcript:**\
[00:00:13.490] - Interviewer\
All right, guys. I'm super excited about our next speaker. She has used her blog to pay off and get out of $238,000 worth of debt, which is just mind-blowing to me. I need to do that, I have a lot of student loans. And she has been consistently earning over $20,000 a month while blogging at the Flooring Girl for nearly three years now. So please welcome Debbie Gartner. Debbie, thank you so much for being here. Welcome.\
\
[00:00:36.590] - Debbie\
Oh, thank you. My pleasure. I'm finally getting to do something here and meeting you. So it's my honor. Thank you.\
\
[00:00:43.430] - Interviewer\
I know I'm so excited. Like we were saying before we hit record, like we've been circling each other for years. So I'm so thrilled that you're part of this podcast this year.\
\
[00:00:50.870] - Debbie\
Thank you. \
\
[00:00:52.190] - Interviewer\
All right. So we are going to be talking about Amazon affiliate marketing, which is a bit of a bear because there's so many rules to it and they'll kick you out and all this stuff. So let's start with just when should people be starting on Amazon? And if they've already maybe started, how can they make sure they get those required sales and not get kicked out?\
\
[00:01:13.130] - Debbie\
Sure. Okay, so in my opinion, people should really start joining Amazon, the program after they've done maybe about ten articles or so. You see everything, as you know, with blogging takes a while, a while to get traffic and traction. But usually by the time you've written ten articles, even if they think, you can get there because you already have a teensy bit of traffic, but it will give you enough time to get those three sales in six months or 180 days. So that's what Amazon recommends. And that's what I recommend.\
\
[00:01:49.310] - Debbie\
Now, can you apply before? Absolutely. I have seen them accept people even before they started their blog. But as soon as you start, your timeline starts and there are plenty of people, as I'm sure you know, they say I'm going to start a blog and they do something and then they don't really start, they get tripped up on what's my blog name, the design, all the stuff that... I mean, the blog name matters, but the design really does not matter much at all. But people can spend a month on that, which is waste of time.\
\
[00:02:22.490] - Debbie\
You got to get in there and get going. So after ten articles, you should be able to, in my opinion, you should be able to easily make three sales within that time period within the six months from that point in time. \
\
[00:02:40.190] - Interviewer\
Okay, so if those ten articles, for example, and obviously you're going to keep writing, how many are sort of focused on, would you go back and have them focus on sharing Amazon links?\
\
[00:02:49.430] - Debbie\
Oh, good question. I guess I would say whenever it's relevant. So when I first started my blog, so I started back in 2010. But this blog on 2011. I didn't know anything about Monetizing at all. I'm glad. So, I had all these articles that were not written for Amazon, not written for Monetizing. I used to have a shop-at-home flooring business, and I wanted people for that. So all my articles were created with that objective in mind. Just help people who are looking for flooring nearby ideally. Educate them on what they needed to know enough so that they would call me.\
\
[00:03:35.290] - Debbie\
But then that was irrelevant to monetizing years later. So I went back and I actually went and edited many of my articles and put links in there when they made sense. And that is the whole key. We are blogging... How do I say this? It's not exactly... The customer doesn't care about us. They're not here to help us make money. We are here to help them with whatever it is. And if we can make money in the process because we've helped them, we've given them the right answer.\
\
[00:04:08.410] - Debbie\
Then by default, we end up making some money. So later what I ended up doing once I learned stuff is I would do articles that were more intentional with better buyer intent so that they could buy something. So everything is going to start with your target customer and your niche. So I write about flooring and painting, and I'm not going to write about I don't know what's the best bike to buy is. It's completely irrelevant or whatever else. You have to do what's relevant to you. So I would then write articles about flooring.\
\
[00:04:45.670] - Debbie\
And by the way, people don't generally buy that much flooring online. So it was another problem that I had. But when people would buy flooring or get their floors finished , they need to know how to clean and maintain their floors, right? They think about all the steps, like right before purchase or right after a purchase, what they're going to need. And then you write articles about that. Generally just putting in affiliate links or affiliate ads of any sort, whether it's an Amazon or somewhere else.\
\
[00:05:20.350] - Debbie\
It won't work. People are there to read the article, not to read the ads. And so if I just plug in some of those things, like, I forget what they call them widgets or whatever the heck. They're like, oh, do this for bounty, it's generally not relevant. Or if I put something on there about web hosting, which, of course, is completely unrelated to my blog, my home d\'e9cor customers won't even know what hosting is, let alone need it. They'll be like, why are you talking to me about religion or whatever? They won't to understand it.\
\
[00:05:56.470] - Debbie\
So it's wasted space. Everything has to be relevant to them. So I'd say if you already wrote articles where it makes sense to put them in, not as an ad but within the text of what you have already written, then go for it and do it. Then going forward, try to be more intentional with the articles that you write. So you think about buyer intent or something that they are about to go and do if that makes any sense, solving a problem. So all my blog posts originally were, what's a problem that my customers actually have.\
\
[00:06:36.130] - Debbie\
And I had the benefit of actually meeting with thousands of customers in their home. So I get the same question over and over again. So for me, it would be like dark versus light hardwood flooring. What's better? Why, what cost less? All those things? Those are all individual questions in there. And then if I had that article, then I might go back and be like, okay, well, dark floors are a little bit harder to maintain, right? So what can I do to make them easier to maintain. So clean every so often.\
\
[00:07:10.030] - Debbie\
Use this cleaner. Use spell pads, whatever. That's kind of my approach on everything. \
\
[00:07:17.770] - Interviewer\
Okay, so one question I have because Amazon is infamous in that you can't do any link cloaking, and there's specific rules about where you can put your links. So how do you kind of manage all your various Amazon affiliate links? I know there are different tools out there, but some really aren't ideal for Amazon. So how do you go about doing that? Because you can end up with hundreds, if not thousands of Amazon links because Amazon has everything. How do you sort of manage and keep that organized.\
\
[00:07:47.050] - Debbie\
Right, right. Good question. So they do have a lot of rules. And my simple answer to the rules is read the rules five times, like three is not enough. Read them, any questions you have, ask. You can always get with them on chat. Just make sure you're not breaking any of the rules. Link cloaking is not allowed, to using things like Pretty links or other things. Anything that camouflages the link is not allowed. So I just never use those. And really you don't need to because a regular person on your site is just going to see the words that are highlighted and click on the anchor text of the link there.\
\
[00:08:22.750] - Debbie\
So it's not a big deal. But the other part of the question which I think you may be getting at is how do I actually track where my sales are coming from? So, I can take that learning to improve because that is so important. I mean, with everything that we're doing, it's so important to track and improve. Just like we look at Google Analytics, we want to know which articles are doing better. So in Amazon, they have tracking IDs, and you can use those. It's free.\
\
[00:08:50.710] - Debbie\
It doesn't cost anything. And that really is the best place to use tracking IDs so that you can learn. Now you can go crazy over these links or you can take a more simple approach, which is what I do because I don't really care usually. Each specific link on the page I want to know which are the pages that are doing well because they always say with market, don't just do it for the sake of doing it, but do it for the sake of an action that you will take or decision you will make, right?\
\
[00:09:23.650] - Debbie\
So the way I do it is I have generally a different tracking ID for each article that I write, and I just make it an obvious one, so I won't forget it. So if I wrote about dark versus light hardwood flooring, I would use a tracking idea like dark versus light. Just very obvious. And then I would do that. I would use every link in that post to use that same tracking ID. That tracks within Amazon, so now every time I go into Amazon to look at how well I'm doing, I look at it and sort it by tracking ID from highest to lowest.\
\
[00:10:06.910] - Debbie\
So I know everything. Like how much money I made, which you won't find with any external program, which is the most important thing. How much money, how many clicks I am getting. What's my conversion rate, what's working. So, I generally do that. Then when I try some new things, which I do from time to time, I may use a different tracking ID and make it similar. So I know it's from the same post, but I did a word that will be obvious to me. That's what I do.\
\
[00:10:37.150] - Debbie\
And then I can track everything and see, okay, did that idea work? Because if that idea worked, then I will write another post and use that same approach. But use the original tracking ID. There used to be a limit where you can only do 100 tracking IDs, but they changed that several years ago. So you can use as many as you want, but don't use too many or you will confuse yourself, and then it doesn't become actionable. \
\
[00:11:07.330] - Interviewer\
All right, can I share my screen? And can you walk me through creating a tracking ID? Because I'm looking, I'm like, oh, yeah. I can select a tracking ID, but I have no idea how to create one. I clearly don't make much of Amazon personally. But I can give it a try.\
\
[00:11:20.170] - Debbie\
Sure. Okay.\
\
[00:11:20.830] - Interviewer\
Let me share my screen. Can you see my screen?\
\
[00:11:24.910] - Debbie\
Yeah.\
\
[00:11:27.010] - Interviewer\
So I see now when I go here, I can try...\
\
[00:11:29.650] - Debbie\
Yeah, that's it. So on my screen, it's on the right side. But anyway, where you just were, go there.\
\
[00:11:39.890] - Interviewer\
Oh, to here?\
\
[00:11:39.940] - Debbie\
And tracking ID. And so... oh wait.\
\
[00:11:44.310] - Interviewer\
To create a tracking ID.\
\
[00:11:45.570] - Debbie\
To create one.\
\
[00:11:46.410] - Debbie\
It's by your email address. Yeah. So it is on the upper right. So your email address is like a little downward arrow. So now you can just create one for your page and there's like a super little glitch, which I'll show you in a second. You have to ignore it. But create the tracking ID. It'll be Dash-20 no matter what, because we're in the US. It's different by country. Create. And it says congratulations, which is good. Sometimes it will say, sorry that one is already taken and it will give you three choices.\
\
[00:12:25.930] - Debbie\
And usually for me, the first choice is exactly what I just Typed in. So I don't know why it has that glitch, so you just have to ignore it. But now you have it. And now if you were to go into Amazon, it should be there in the menu. Although it is possible you need to do another page.\
\
[00:12:44.350] - Interviewer\
Like a little refresh.\
\
[00:12:46.150] - Debbie\
Yeah, you probably need to do that, but it would just be there.\
\
[00:12:54.050] - Interviewer\
Check that out, guys.\
\
[00:12:55.610] - Debbie\
Yeah, that's all you do. Oh, by the way, I don't do the short links that are there. So I changed it to be a full length, and there's a few reasons for that. One of them is because sometimes the short lengths, there's a glitch and it doesn't always work, and I want to make as much money as possible. Secondly, it's way easier when you have it this way because the link is... Or sorry, the tracking ID is in there. And so let's say I wanted to change it, or let's say I have a section where I have the same thing I use over and over.\
\
[00:13:31.310] - Debbie\
Like, these products might be good. If you have hardwood floors, let's say I have four links in there, then I can go and I can copy that into my next article. And then I can just do a search and replace on Microsoft Word and then have it changed to whatever the tracking ID is for that post.\
\
[00:13:50.210] - Interviewer\
Well, I've just learned something new.\
\
[00:13:53.750] - Debbie\
By the way, if you ever sell a blog to, this is very helpful because you can change all the tracking IDs, even if you forgot. I mean, I have an Amazon course where I show a little hack for that if you forgot to do it. So someone can go and do it in, I don't know, 30 seconds or so for each page. So when I bought a blog, I had someone do that for me and she's like, wow, I didn't realize that was available.\
\
[00:14:18.830] - Interviewer\
Yeah, genius.\
\
[00:14:19.550] - Debbie\
Definitely helps.\
\
[00:14:19.790] - Interviewer\
I like it.\
\
[00:14:21.170] - Debbie\
Good.\
\
[00:14:21.950] - Interviewer\
I'll stop sharing my screen so we can get back to it.\
\
[00:14:25.190] - Interviewer\
All right, so using the tracking IDs to kind of actually see what pages are performing and how they're performing. I have a lot of work to do to. Now go back and edit things. Thank you. So, how do you kind of make sure you're getting consistent commissions? Because, yes, you want your minimum three to keep your account active. But is there something you do to make sure that you're getting consistent commissions?\
\
[00:14:50.910] - Debbie\
So usually things are pretty consistent for me because one of the keys to doing well on affiliate marketing and Amazon in particular, is doing well on SEO. And I've always done SEO. So I learned that, like, 2010 to 2012. So because the traffic is generally consistent, my commissions are consistent as well. Now, that doesn't mean 100%. So for me, I do like home d\'e9cor, right. So home d\'e9cor is pretty steady, like taking the whole pandemic, putting that aside. But generally throughout the year, it's pretty consistent from January until the weekend before Thanksgiving, and then everything kind of drops because people are worried about the holidays.\
\
[00:15:39.870] - Debbie\
They get a Christmas tree. They're not going to do more home d\'e9cor. They're certainly not going to do flooring work once that tree is in there, right. So it goes down every year that time until December 26. So, I was looking forward to the day after from an income perspective, the day after Christmas because everything goes back up and then life is back to normal. It goes down for another couple of days around the first or the 31st, and then goes back up. Because the traffic is consistent, so are the Commission. Now, I do have some seasonal items, so I have a few that I've written a few years ago on Christmas, and they obviously do not do that well during most of the year. Although I start seeing sales generally a little bit in July and August, but those will really go up all of November and December, even past the 25th, because people go back for their after Christmas sales and get good prices. So that's usually good then. And I have a few other items that may peak a little bit in the spring, and it all depends on what it is that you write about.\
\
[00:16:53.550] - Debbie\
But I always look at those things as supplements, so that will keep building over time. But for most of my stuff, I try to do evergreen content, so it's usually pretty consistent. \
\
[00:17:06.630] - Interviewer\
All right, so we have a couple of follow up questions to that. First, if you ever do a post that isn't going to have an Amazon link, I mean, they'll probably have a different affiliate link, but just out of curiosity.\
\
[00:17:16.530] - Debbie\
So Amazon is only one of my affiliates. They're the first one that I did really well with, and I often or usually make $4,000 to $5,000 a month on that. But everything is more starts with what's good for the customer. And then if Amazon is appropriate, I use Amazon. But I also do really well with Reward Style, which is another program which I really love, because once you're in that, you have access to all the programs. Amazon is great because there's so much stuff on Amazon, right.\
\
[00:17:54.150] - Debbie\
And people buy from Amazon all the time. If they buy one item, but if they have ten others in their cart, I can also earn money on that as well. But Reward Style is also great, because when I'm in there, I have access to all the programs. So it works really well. But it all is what is relevant. So if you're asking, do I write articles without affiliate links at all? Yeah, I probably have a few, but that all depends on your strategy. So my approach is, I'd rather do articles that can at least have some affiliate stuff in there, even if the main focus is somewhere else.\
\
[00:18:36.810] - Debbie\
But I like to get kind of a two for one because traffic is good. It's not the beyond the end all, it's like step one, right? It's only step one. There's so much more you need to do after. You can actually earn a lot more on affiliate marketing than you can on ads. And you can do products too. So I try to do more that will help me there now that I've been doing this for a while. So I only earn about $5,000-$6,000 a month on ads.\
\
[00:19:10.350] - Debbie\
But on affiliate marketing, I earn more like $18,000 a month on average. So I try to do stuff that will get me primarily affiliate stuff and secondarily ads. I don't flutter those posts with ads.\
\
[00:19:30.150] - Interviewer\
All right I mean, kind of guesstimating here. What would you say? What percentage of your posts have an Amazon affiliate link in them, like 80% 90%?\
\
[00:19:40.580] - Debbie\
I don't know. Probably, I would guess maybe 80% to 90%, but most of my money is only coming from, I don't know. Let's call it 20 articles or something like that. \
\
[00:19:58.470] - Interviewer\
Sure, sure. I think some people maybe only have Amazon links in, like 5% of their posts, and then they're wondering whether not making more. So just kind of want to kind of point that out that it could... Obviously, the more you put out there, the more likely you'll get a click.\
\
[00:20:13.410] - Debbie\
Right, if you're asking me how many articles have any affiliate link.\
\
[00:20:17.550] - Interviewer\
Oh, I would hope that's closer to 100.\
\
[00:20:20.310] - Debbie\
Yeah, I would guess maybe 95%. i may not be correct, but it's directionally correct. Sure.\
\
[00:20:29.610] - Interviewer\
My other question is because you've mentioned SEO. So a lot of people forget that affiliate marketing, there's a marketing piece to it. It sounds like you're primarily doing SEO, but do you ever do kind of additional marketing for your affiliate marketing? And how do you go about using SEO for marketing?\
\
[00:20:48.690] - Speaker 2\
Right, so I grew up on SEO. Pinterest came much later, second to me, I just consider that supplemental and SEO traffic is much more reliable. So basically, with affiliate marketing in general, there are three main or the three, in my opinion, best ways to earn affiliate commissions. They are one, SEO because people are searching with intent to either buy or figure out something, so they're much more likely to buy. The second one is email. Now, email won't really work for Amazon because you're not allowed to use Amazon links in there.\
\
[00:21:26.850] - Debbie\
But in general, it can work, especially when you have a loyal audience as well as when your list grows. But just having a large list is pointless. But anyway, that can really work and can eventually become your number one source. I mean, it may take you a while to get there, but it can. And then the third one is video. So video, especially YouTube, will act like a search engine so it can be the same thing. People can actually search on YouTube or they can search on Google or wherever.\
\
[00:22:00.330] - Debbie\
And often those videos will come up. So those would be the three areas I'd focus on. When it comes to Amazon, I'd really only focus on number one and number three, but I know those can work wonders for your business. So definitely think about that. I do very well on affiliate marketing, and from my email list, I probably make a good... Let me think for a second. So I know I make more than $10,000 a month from my email list, but I don't know the exact breakout of my products versus affiliate commissions, but I would venture to guess that at this point now, I probably make more on affiliate commissions than I do on my own products, but they both do really well that way.\
\
[00:22:48.030] - Interviewer\
So let's talk about really quickly. You mentioned SEO because there's an intent there. What kind of intent? I mean, you want them to be in the space to buy, not just trying to figure out what's out there. How do you kind of figure that out? Is there an SEO tool you use or just a strategy in general?\
\
[00:23:07.710] - Debbie\
Yeah. so I just use the strategy in general. And I will also say people won't want to hear this, but sometimes I just use my gut to do it because I've been in this business for a long time, so I know what my customers ask for, because some of the SEO tools will not give you all the right information. And I go more for a long tail search. But if I had to choose a place, like the best place is probably [unclear], depending on how you prefer to say it.\
\
[00:23:41.730] - Debbie\
So I go after very long tail stuff and or what seems to be most relevant to my particular audience. So, I use a method where I just look at the ones that have the lowest competition and which I think will lead to good sales. So you can follow different formulas. And I have some of this in my Amazon course too. But like the best X for Y. So I just go back to bikes because I randomly talked about that before, but I wouldn't just say the best bikes, right?\
\
[00:24:16.950] - Debbie\
Like that's too broad and vague. And who's even going to search for that? But I might say, like, what are the best bikes for young kids or little girls? Like the more specific I can get or for mountain bike riding, whatever. But be specific. So not just one of the best bikes, but what are the best X for Y? Another method I use is alternatives for things. So you could take a big brand that's well known that people might search for in that category. And like I'm looking at my refrigerator now.\
\
[00:24:55.530] - Debbie\
So like, what's a big brand for refrigerators that might be expensive. You get the idea. \
\
[00:25:01.530] - Interviewer\
You'd be like, Whirlpool alternatives that are the best or something.\
\
[00:25:05.130] - Debbie\
Right, so you might say alternatives to Whirlpool or Whirlpool hot tub. I mean, whatever it is that you're writing about, that's the idea. So take something that people want, but a whole bunch of them may not be able to afford, and you're going to give them alternatives that will get them their desired benefit, but at a price point, that may make sense for them, because lots of people will price shop and they want a good value. Most people don't want cheap, they want a good value. So they want something that is good, doesn't suck but for less money. Is that make sense?\
\
[00:25:41.130] - Interviewer\
It's not about the lowest cost. I miss the best value for the lowest cost.\
\
[00:25:44.310] - Debbie\
Exactly, exactly\
\
[00:25:47.770] - Interviewer\
And then I just want to say we did touch on that. Like Amazon isn't the only affiliate marketing in town.\
\
[00:25:53.470] - Interviewer\
Diversify as you said, as you may have seen on my screen, Amazon is nowhere near my business. If amazon isn't fit for your audience, don't stress it.\
\
[00:26:08.990] - Debbie\
That's right. Amazon is not right for everybody at all, and every niche is not. If physical products are right for your audience or right for that blog post, then Amazon is probably a good bet because their conversion rate is so much higher than other equivalent retailers. So most retail products believe it or not, have a 1% conversion, which sounds like it sucks, but it is a fact of life. So you need to remember that. This is why you need lots of volume, okay? About 1% versus Amazon when you're doing well, not stellar, but when you're doing well on Amazon, you should be able to get 8% to 10% conversion. I personally usually get 10% to 12%, but 8% to 10% is a good place to shoot for. But if you just do the math, even though Amazon Commission may appear to be lower than some places, and by the way, often they're not when you do apples to apples comparison. Because if you look at this on Walmart or versus whatever, they're usually not that different when you do that. But anyway, pretend that they were, right? You would need the other place to be paying you eight times as much commission just to be equal with Amazon.\
\
[00:27:27.110] - Debbie\
Amazon converts well, because people trust Amazon, they can get other stuff on Amazon. Most people have a credit card already stored on Amazon. They make it easy to buy. Yeah, they're good at upsells. I mean, so many reasons. So when people say get off Amazon because of low commissions, that to me is not valid. If they say, go to other places in addition to Amazon. Yes. Or if Amazon or retail products are not relevant to you, your blog or your audience, yes. Don't feel like you have to do Amazon, like diversify.\
\
[00:28:04.430] - Debbie\
So I would guess that Amazon at this point is probably like 20% to 25% of my affiliates, and affiliates are one of my largest contribution right now. They're not even all that I make. I generally make, you know, I don't know, $25,000 to $30,000 in profit. Obviously, my revenue is higher because I have costs in there, but I always measure things on profit, and that's only part of it. So it's a percent of a percent. You need to think about this, like the stock market. Like I'm not just going to buy GE or whatever.\
\
[00:28:42.950] - Debbie\
I'm going to have a variety of stocks because some will go up, some will go down. I'm going to then get mutual funds or index funds. And then I'm also going to have difference in asset allocation. It's like bonds versus mutual funds or stocks or versus real estate. And what's your situation? How old are you? How long until? \
\
[00:29:04.250] - Interviewer\
Yeah, what's your risk tolerance?\
\
[00:29:06.350] - Debbie\
Exactly.\
\
[00:29:07.430] - Interviewer\
Okay, so we're running out of time. I know you have a free guide for everyone. You want to tell them about that?\
\
[00:29:15.890] - Debbie\
Oh, yeah. So I have a guide for Amazon specifically. Although some of the tips will actually apply to all networks, so just bear that in mind because I do well in affiliate marketing in general. But it's seven tips to improve your Amazon commissions, and I'm giving that away for free. So you guys can have that. And I hope it's helpful.\
\
[00:29:37.490] - Interviewer\
Yes, the link for that will be below. And if you get the pro pass, you will get access to Debbie's book, e-book. 45 not so obvious lessons she learned on the way to $20,000 a month, which I read it, and it's excellent. So definitely consider that.\
\
[00:29:53.270] - Interviewer\
Okay, Debbie, thank you so much for being here. Any final words?\
\
[00:29:58.490] - Debbie\
No, I would just say rock on, blog on, keep going onward and upward and keep plowing ahead. And you can do this. \
\
[00:30:09.050] - Interviewer\
That's right. All right, guys, we'll catch you at the next session. \

Hi, Destini here. And welcome to the short training, where I'm going to walk you through how to recession-proof your business by adding digital products to your portfolio. Now, for those of you who may not know me, my name is Dr. Destini Copp, and I am a college marketing professor turned online entrepreneur. I have been creating digital courses way back in the dark ages ever since 2005. So, I have been there and done that.\
\
[00:00:45.820] - Destini\
I'm also the host of the Course Creators MBA podcast and an Amazon best selling author of "launch your online course business in 90 days or less". I am the host of the Scale Your Business Summit and CEO of Destinicopp.com, which is my personal brand. We also have another brand called Hobby School, where we launch virtual summits and a lot of different hobby type niches, which that is a very fun brand if you want to check it out. You can find me on most social media platforms at Destini Copp. And I would love for you to contact me.\
\
[00:01:24.550] - Destini\
You can hook up with me on LinkedIn or DM me on Instagram. I would love to know more about you and your business. Now, I want to tell you a story, which one, I think you can kind of relate to this, or most of you can probably relate to this. A few years ago, I was on vacation with my family in Watercolor, Florida.\
\
[00:01:49.030] - Destini\
And if you've ever been to the Gulf Coast of Florida, the ocean and the beach does look like this. And one day my family was leaving to go to the beach, and I could not go with them. At that point in time, I was a Facebook ads consultant. So, I helped people create and you know load their Facebook ads into their business manager and launch them and optimize them. And I had a client that day whose Facebook ads were not performing as well as he liked, and he was unhappy.\
\
[00:02:25.160] - Destini\
So I had to stay back and work on them. And after that vacation, I came back and I said, that will never happen to me again. And that's when I went all in into creating digital products and automated sales funnels, sometimes we call them evergreen sales funnels in my business. So, today I have a variety of different offers, you know, that I have, and you can see some of them here, but most of my income comes from these passive income digital products and also affiliate marketing revenue.\
\
[00:03:04.140] - Destini\
Now, here's what you're going to learn in this short training today. I'm going to walk you through five types of digital products that are absolutely perfect for business owners and how to choose the best one to start with, so you can get started easily and quickly. Now, we're going to jump right in. Now, here's the five types of digital products that I recommend for business owners to kind of build out that digital product portfolio, if you would. The first one is a mini course.\
\
[00:03:37.660] - Destini\
And this is what it sounds like, a very tiny offer. It can range anywhere from like $27 all the way up to $99. And it's going to give your customer a quick win. And then we have what I call a subject matter course. And this type of course goes into a little bit more detail than a mini course would.\
\
[00:04:01.960] - Destini\
And then you have that full blown signature course which is your A to Z type you know formula that you teach people. It might even have some other stuff bundled in with it, which we'll talk about in just a second. And then you have a membership. And I love memberships because you're getting that monthly recurring revenue and it gives you kind of that stable income, if you would, into your business. And then of course, you have these digital products like ebooks, templates, swipe files, planners.\
\
[00:04:36.180] - Destini\
I love all of them and they are very easily created in Canva. So, all of those are options for you. Now, remember when I mentioned just a second ago, I talked about your signature offer and I mentioned it might have some other type of support in it. So, here is when you're kind of thinking about your digital products, you also have to think about how you're going to design them and how you're going to support your students in them. Now, the majority of my digital products are what I call a self-study type course.\
\
[00:05:14.020] - Destini\
So, if the student is going through it and they have questions, there are places in my classroom. And right now, I'm using Kajabi where they can go in and ask questions and I'll answer them. You can also have some type of Facebook group or community. And I also have tested this out and use this in some of my other programs. I use Upcoach, there's other people out there using Circle, I think it's Circle.so, very successfully. So, there's a lot of different options for you there.\
\
[00:05:47.560] - Destini\
Now, when you are adding in this other type of support, like the communities or the live Zoom calls, which a lot of people do in membership, or even one on one support or group coaching, when you're adding in that additional support, you're going to want to price it accordingly. So, for instance, like your signature offer, which we talked about earlier, which is your A to Z type online course where you kind of you know walk people through your entire formula, you're most likely going to have some extra support in that, but it's going to be priced accordingly. So, the signature courses and I'll go back to the slide for just a second, the signature courses can be anywhere from 500 or 2000, 3000, I've even seen them going up to like 5000 when there's a lot of support in them. Okay. Now what I generally recommend, if you are just starting out and kind of dipping your toes into creating digital products, I would like for you to start with a mini course or maybe even a low priced digital product like a planner.\
\
[00:07:03.490] - Destini\
And the reason why, and there's a lot of reasons why I love minicourses, and one of the reasons why is that minicourses can be created in less than a week. And I'm going to walk you through some tips today on how to do this and let you know that it absolutely can be done. So, if you are really wanting to kind of dip your toes into this and get started quickly, you could have your mini course created very, very soon. So, let's talk a little bit more about minicourses. The reason why I love minicourses, and I think most online business owners need to have one in their back pocket, is that you can just use them in a lot of different ways in your business.\
\
[00:07:52.090] - Destini\
The first one is using it as a tripwire. So, when somebody signs up for your lead magnet, maybe you have a PDF type lead magnet or cheat sheet or something like that on your thank you page. You will have your sales page for your tripwire and it'll say something like, wait, before you go, I have this special offer that I think you may be interested in, so you can get an instant customer and get that revenue in your business from that mini course. The other reason why I love minicourse is that you can sell them fairly easily through email versus a signature course. You're going to need something in general a little bit more substantial to sell it, like maybe even doing a live webinar or a fiveday challenge or something like that.\
\
[00:08:45.270] - Destini\
You can also use a minicourse in collaboration opportunities. As an example, let's say that you have been invited to be a virtual summit speaker and the host of the summit is looking for a donation for the all access pass. You could put one of your digital products in that all access pass, the host will be happy, it'll give you an opportunity to get more eyeballs on your business and it's just a win-win for everybody. And it also can be used as a lead magnet for special events. So, there's a lot of different ways you could use something like this in your business.\
\
[00:09:27.840] - Destini\
Now let's talk about how to plan out your digital product portfolio so you can maximize your revenue, which will help you recession-proof your business. Now, the first thing I want you to do, if you're just getting started, you don't have your idea yet, I really want you to sit down, grab a piece of paper and start thinking about how you help people, maybe what are you blogging about, think about the type of questions you're getting today from your audience on social media, from clients, anybody who you're working with. Think about what knowledge you have, your superpower, and you're just going up. Lay it all down on a piece of paper and just start brainstorming about some things that you can teach on. Now when I first started doing this when I moved into entrepreneurship from my nine to five type job, I had a lot of different things that I could help people with.\
\
[00:10:27.360] - Destini\
I was really good with managing a remote organization. I had a thousand people in my remote organization when I left my nine to five, so I was really good at that. They were all remote, scattered across the US, so I Could have done something in that area. I was really good with my organization and productivity, so I could have done something there.\
\
[00:10:52.540] - Destini\
I eventually landed on helping people create online courses because I had been doing that since 2005. And I combined that with all of my marketing knowledge, so I help people create online courses and also, which is most important, probably part of the process, I help them market them. Now, after you have that you've done your brainstorming, I want you to go in and conduct some research on what's in the market. Of course, you can go to Google, but I also want you to go to like, marketplaces, like creative market, Etsy, AppSumo, if you're in the business kind of market and Udemy.\
\
[00:11:34.480] - Destini\
And I'm gonna talk about Udemy in just a second also. And just go in there, look to see what kind of digital products do they have. Now I know creative market and Etsy has a ton of digital products. I have purchased a lot of those digital products. And of course, like Masterclass, Skillshare, LinkedIn Learning, Udemy. They have a ton of online courses in a lot of different areas and just get an idea on what's in the market.\
\
[00:12:04.930] - Destini\
Now, this doesn't mean that you're going to copy what other people have done. But if somebody out there is already teaching what you want to teach about, that means that there's a demand in the market for it. It doesn't mean that you're going to copy them, you're certainly not going to do that. You're going to add your own kind of influence and superpower in there, but you want to make sure that there's a demand in the marketplace for that.\
\
[00:12:35.130] - Destini\
So, I mentioned just a second ago, I was going to tell you a little bit more about Udemy. So, if you go to Udemy and if you sign up to be an instructor, if you go to their market insights, you can conduct market research for free on your niche. So basically, you go there, you type in what you're interested in teaching about, they will let you know what kind of demand they're seeing for that, how many people are searching for that topic. This is a wealth of information.\
\
[00:13:09.340] - Destini\
Not only will they tell you how many people are searching, they will also tell you how many, basically, should kind of give you an idea of how many courses they have already in that particular niche. So, you'll kind of see how saturated the market is. And it's okay if there's other people out there teaching on it. Actually, you want that, but you also kind of see what the demand is also, okay? Now I want you to brainstorm ideas for your online course portfolio.\
\
[00:13:42.310] - Destini\
Now, I talked with you just a second ago, why I recommend that you go with a mini course. You can also create some digital type products also, but eventually, you will likely want to add other courses to it to, kind of build out your portfolio so you can increase your revenue. Now, here's something that I did for a client or student recently. This particular student was in the cryptocurrency niche. So, we went out and did research because they wanted to get an idea what kind of courses could they do, what should they start with and how could they build it out later.\
\
[00:14:23.220] - Destini\
So, as an example, we landed on doing like a lead magnet mini course. What is cryptocurrency? So, you're getting somebody who's very much a beginner, like me. I'm not an expert in this area, so very much a beginner, getting this started. A lot of people are going to have that question, what is cryptocurrency?\
\
[00:14:44.620] - Destini\
What exactly is it? They don't really know what it is. And then going into the tripwire mini course, "Cryptocurrency 101: a Complete Guide for Beginners". So, going in just a little bit more detail. And then upsell course, or this could even be a membership, how to get started in trading cryptocurrency.\
\
[00:15:11.700] - Destini\
Now you can you know change that up a little bit, especially if you want to do a membership, have an ongoing membership to help people with trading cryptocurrency. So, you kind of get the idea there. And then of course, an example of a cross sell course here. Buy, sell and create NTFs. So that gives you an idea of how you can go in and kind of brainstorm ideas for your online course portfolio.\
\
[00:15:37.440] - Destini\
Now here's another example. This example centers around somebody who helps people do home gardens and homesteading. So, a lead magnet for this particular person could possibly be a PDF guide on container gardening with a mini course. That's a tripwire on planning a raised bed garden with diagrams. So, go in, have some videos there, have some diagrams there.\
\
[00:16:06.600] - Destini\
It will give their students a very much a quick win. So, once you add them to your online course, you're going to start your nurture emails, and in there, you're going to promote your other products and services. So, you could have a cross sell course in there. Maybe you want to do some virtual gardening or homesteading consultation. So, you could definitely do that and promote that in there.\
\
[00:16:32.320] - Destini\
And then eventually you could promote like a coaching A to Z signature homesteading course or even a membership there. Membership would probably actually work very well in that situation. So, there's lots of opportunities there to add additional revenue into your business. Now, I want to let you know that it is easier to get started than you think. And I want to walk you through a couple of things here.\
\
[00:16:59.610] - Destini\
Now, this is an example of a mini course outline, and I'll show you in just a second. This is actually it. Or I have an outline for this in the Google Sheets that has all of our online course ideas. So, basically, what you're going to do, you're going to start with your promise transformation. So, basically, what that is telling you or what you're outlined there is what will your students accomplish after completing your course?\
\
[00:17:29.810] - Destini\
Creating a course for the marketplace is very different than creating a course for somebody who is completing like an educational program, like an MBA or a bachelor's degree. In there, you have all these learning objectives and then, you know it's just a different process. Here, you are strictly going to focus on at the end of this course, my student will be able to do XYZ. Okay? That is, everything in your course will center around that.\
\
[00:18:07.890] - Destini\
Now, for a mini course, you're not going to have a lot of different videos. You're not going to have a lot of different lessons. Quite frankly, I would even argue in a subject matter course or a signature course, you're not gonna, you're not going to throw a lot of content in there. A lot of people think the more content I can throw in there, that's what increases the value and the price of my course. And that is not the case.\
\
[00:18:35.790] - Destini\
Your students are paying you, so that they can get your promise transformation the fastest way possible. And they do not have time, let me say it again, they do not have time to sit down and watch 30, 40, 60 minutes lessons. In fact, they want, there's been research studies done on this and lessons, course lessons, actually, you know, and it's even gone down here recently. Their attention spans are only a couple of minutes, two, three, five minutes. I know some people, I even go up to maybe even ten minute lessons in some of my online courses, but I think even that is pushing it.\
\
[00:19:25.660] - Destini\
So, your students want short, straight and to the point information, and they want short lessons. They don't have time to sit through these long videos. So I would argue in a mini course, it should be very short, maybe five lessons, five videos. You're gonna have some supplemental material, maybe a workbook, a cheat sheet or a checklist. Also, I don't want you to forget about your bonus material.\
\
[00:19:59.960] - Destini\
Now, this is material that they don't necessarily need to accomplish your promise transformation, but it's just nice to have information. But most importantly, it's bonuses that you can put on your sales page to help sell your course. So, people will look at that bonus and say, oh my goodness, I really have to have that. So, don't forget about your bonuses. And that's actually a mistake that a lot of people make.\
\
[00:20:31.290] - Destini\
Now, the other thing I want to point out is the same steps that you use to create your mini course are going to be the same steps that you would go through to create a higher price course, like what we talked about earlier, like your subject matter course or your signature course. There are a few exceptions to this, but the process is very, very simple. And I think a lot of people try to make it a little bit more complicated than what it needs to be. The other thing I want to let you know, and this is one of my last tips here for you today, is that you can use Canva to create your lesson presentations and even record your lesson videos in Canva. In fact, I use Canva to create the presentation that you are watching today, and I'm currently recording it in Canva. So, it is super, super easy.\
\
[00:21:36.110] - Destini\
So, there you go. I hope I have inspired you to go in and create your first digital product. And then as you kind of dip your toes there, you can expand out into other types of digital products that you can add to your portfolio to help recession-proof your business. Now, like I said before you go, make sure you grab your free gift, I've included the link here.\
\
[00:22:05.790] - Destini\
Now, if you can't find the link, you can always go to my website and grab the free gift there. Now, if you go to your Google sheet and you can see the tab in there for the mini course outline, I just want to let you know that that is there. I hope you enjoyed this presentation. If you have any questions whatsoever, please contact me on social media. Mostly hang out on LinkedIn or Instagram, and you can find me both there.\
\
[00:22:37.090] - Destini\
Have a great rest of your day. Bye for now.\

And I'm going to walk you through how to kind of map it out for your business and set it up in general with this free gift. So definitely check that out before you go today.\
\
[00:01:12.660] - Dr. Destini Copp\
Now, for those of you who don't know me, my name is Dr. Destini Copp. I'm a college marketing professor turned online entrepreneur. I'm the host of the Creators MBA Podcast in the Digital Product Growth Summit. And my superpower is helping business owners craft growth strategies with digital products and sales funnels.\
\
[00:01:32.340] - Dr. Destini Copp\
I'm CEO of several different businesses my personal brand which has been out there for many years which is destinicop.com. I also have a Shopify store called hellocontent.shop. And that's where you can find a lot of different content for your business that you can use in your courses to create courses, to create memberships, lead magnets, and just use in marketing in your business and then also wrote -- can't even talk. I also own a brand called HobbyScool.\
\
[00:02:05.180] - Dr. Destini Copp\
And in HobbyScool, we do online learning virtual summits about all types of different hobbies. So think about, like, art journaling, crafting, needleworking, quilting, I mean just a ton of different hobbies. We love everything hobbies at HobbyScool. And I also have a Shopify store for HobbyScool. Also -- and you can reach me on most social media platforms @destinicopp.\
\
[00:02:33.300] - Dr. Destini Copp\
Quite frankly, I'm most active on LinkedIn, but you can reach me on the other platforms also. Now, here is why I focus mostly on digital products and automated sales funnels as my main revenue stream in my businesses. Now, I have other things, as you mentioned, I have the Shopify stores. I also do a little bit of one-on-one type coaching, but my main income comes from these passive income.\
\
[00:03:06.470] - Dr. Destini Copp\
I'll say passive, they're still work, but passive income digital products and automated sales funnels and it really stems from an event that happened in my life when I was at WaterColor with my family. And if you've ever been down to WaterColor, Florida which is kind of near like Destin Seaside, that area, it's on 30A in Florida and the water absolutely does look like this. So, if you've ever been there\
\
[00:03:32.710] - Dr. Destini Copp\
you know it's beautiful, absolutely beautiful there. My family was going down to the beach, and at that point in time, I was a Facebook ads manager and a client that I was working on in his Facebook ads, in his mind, were not performing as well as they should, and quite frankly, what we found out after, you know, after that big hoohah there it just that the price had gone up, right, for the Facebook ads -- just price had increased.\
\
[00:04:00.150] - Dr. Destini Copp\
There was a lot of demand during that time that he was running his event, but I had to stay back and not go to the beach with my family. We paid a lot of money for this beach vacation, and I had to work on his Facebook ads. And I came back from that vacation, I said absolutely never, never again. I'm never doing that again, and that's when I kind of left the service work, if you would.\
\
[00:04:23.030] - Dr. Destini Copp\
And I said, I'm going all in on digital products, and fast forward several years later it has been one of the best decisions that I have ever made. So my life now is around 95 percent passive income which is coming from the digital product revenue and affiliate marketing. I do a lot of affiliate marketing also, and you can see this is the ThriveCart account for one of our funnels that we ran this summer.\
\
[00:04:52.350] - Dr. Destini Copp\
Again, this was one of the funnels. Now we were -- the caveat here is we were driving traffic to this, so this just didn't magically happen. But as you can see, this is through all low-cost digital products. And I'm going to walk you through what exactly was in this funnel just so you can know that it can be done even with low-cost digital products. So here's what we're going to cover in this presentation today\
\
[00:05:17.660] - Dr. Destini Copp\
I'm going to talk about what are sales funnels and the strategic advantage that they offer. I'm going to go behind the scenes of what a sales funnel looks like and some of the tools that I use for these funnels, but also, which I think is very important, is how you can add a personal touch and ethical practices into these automated sales funnels. Now, I'm -- as we go through this, I'm going to be using the word automated, evergreen, autopilot it all means the same thing.\
\
[00:05:49.460] - Dr. Destini Copp\
It just means it's a funnel that's automated that you set up and you kind of set it and forget it to some extent. I mean, you still need to go in, monitor it, make sure it's working, make sure your -- everything's converting properly, but you're not messing with it on a daily basis. And then, which is very important, we're going to talk about traffic strategies to get eyeballs on your funnel. Now, if you're a blogger and you've built up a good base of like your email list, you might already have some of those strategies in place so you might not have a lot of work to do\
\
[00:06:23.770] - Dr. Destini Copp\
there. So let me talk about a little bit more about what do I mean by automated sales funnel. So it means a funnel that's always ready to sell. It saves you time, right. It keeps people interested, so you're giving them a quick win. And I'm going to walk you through what I mean by that as we go through this.\
\
[00:06:45.960] - Dr. Destini Copp\
And you're really using that funnel to initiate and to build that relationship with them whether it's through a free gift that you're offering or a low cost digital product. And one of the things that I love about these automated funnels is with these low cost digital products you're giving people a way to say, you know, an easy yes to something that you have to offer. And when they say -- give you -- when you -- when you give them an opportunity to say an easy yeah -- yes, they're going to get to know you better because people tend to if they buy something, they're generally going to consume it. Right? And then that puts them in a position if they really like what you did, they like what you had to offer that puts them in a position for, you know, when you have something higher price to sell down the road, they're more likely to buy with you and it doesn't break their bank. Right?\
\
[00:07:35.700] - Dr. Destini Copp\
Like I said, it's an easy yes, and it also gives them an opportunity to kind of grow with your business. So you have some type of value offer, right, that you can set up with these automated and evergreen sales funnels that they can, you know, buy with you month after month or, you know, however often that you have offers that are available to them. I can tell you in HobbyScool, we have people that come to our online learning virtual summits. Every time we offer one and they purchase it, they're like, yes, this is something I know. I love this.\
\
[00:08:10.340] - Dr. Destini Copp\
I want to buy from you. So it definitely works out. Now, here's an example of one of these automated sales funnels. So somebody in the, you know, in the first kind of up at the top left here they are going to be buying or sign -- not buying, but signing up for your free offer. Now, in this case, it was a summit that we were doing.\
\
[00:08:34.180] - Dr. Destini Copp\
Doesn't have to be. I have tons of -- I have a lot of these funnels that I've set up where it was just a free gift. Maybe it was some templates that I had. Maybe it is -- I'm trying to think of some of the ones that I have set up today.\
\
[00:08:50.010] - Dr. Destini Copp\
Templates work very well for us. One is like a planner. So the free gift is a planner that works very well for us. So they sign up for your free gift, and then on that next page that is where you have your tripwire offer. So really a tripwire offer is just a really low cost type offer that makes it easy for them to say yes to, so an example in one -- \
\
[00:09:18.050] - Dr. Destini Copp\
and I'll give you an example for the free gift that I have for you today. So on the next page, after you sign up for the free gift, which is a planner to plan your profitable evergreen sales funnel, on the next place you're in get a really awesome offer for our Evergreen Funnel course. So if you're interested in actually setting up an evergreen funnel that will be on that next page, and then from there let's say somebody clicks and say they want to buy, then you'll go to a checkout. Now, I use ThriveCart for all of this, not for all -- not for the landing pages.\
\
[00:09:51.940] - Dr. Destini Copp\
I use Leadpages for the free gift and the tripwire sales page. But once they click to purchase, then that takes me to ThriveCart and on ThriveCart, on the checkout page, you'll have the offer, but then you also have a little order bump. So a little order bump might be a $7 offer or a $9 offer or whatever something that complements your tripwire offer your main offer that you're giving them but just adds a little bit more to it. So it's again a really easy yes.\
\
[00:10:21.270] - Dr. Destini Copp\
So then they have two offers right there that they can purchase from you, and then from there depending on what you have to sell, and we'll go into some examples with that in this presentation, you can have other upsells or downsells there and then they go to checkout. You give them the order confirmation emails. But even if, let me just say, even if they don't go on to buy anything else from you, they're still on your email list. Right?\
\
[00:10:46.590] - Dr. Destini Copp\
So you're still going to send them out an email welcome sequence where you still can promote some of these other offers if they didn't buy. So this generally what it looks like there. So let's talk about some of the tech tools, and I kind of hinted at them just a second ago, but for your landing page, for your free gift, and for your sales page, I use Leadpages. The other thing I like about Leadpages is it has that countdown timer in there for urgency. So on your tripwire page, you will want a countdown timer.\
\
[00:11:21.760] - Dr. Destini Copp\
I like to do 15 or 20 minutes there. I have found we have tested other things. We've tested 30. We've tested, you know, even a little bit longer. It's too long.\
\
[00:11:31.440] - Dr. Destini Copp\
Fifteen to 20 minutes is the ideal spot there. You're going to have a cart sales funnel builder like ThriveCart. You'll need an email service provider. We use ConvertKit. But there's tons of options out there for you. And depending on how you set up your evergreen sales funnel, you may need some type of webinar platform or scheduling system,\
\
[00:11:54.020] - Dr. Destini Copp\
so if you have a place for them to set up, you know, time with you or book with you, or if you're promoting a higher priced course. So let's say you're promoting like a course that's $1,000 you're going to need a webinar down -- further down that funnel. Not right away, not in what I showed you in the slide -- in the slide, but previously. You're going to need some type of extra convincing, right. They're going to need more information before they invest, you know, 500 or $1,000.\
\
[00:12:28.160] - Dr. Destini Copp\
Okay? So let me kind of walk you through this example. So here's another example. So let's say that you are in the blogging niche where you are doing like meal plans, groceries, that sort of thing. You're in the healthy eating, that sort of thing.\
\
[00:12:46.550] - Dr. Destini Copp\
Your free gift here could be like an ebook with recipes moving on to the tripwire, which could be Create the Perfect Meal Course. So that's your tripwire and then from there let's say you're going to the checkout. The checkout is in ThriveCart. Remember?\
\
[00:13:01.290] - Dr. Destini Copp\
From there they would check out for the Create the Perfect Meal course, but you would have an order bump with some recipe cards. So you kind of see how that complements your Create the Perfect Meal course. So maybe the create the perfect meal course is $27. Maybe your recipe cards are like $7 or whatever.\
\
[00:13:19.100] - Dr. Destini Copp\
And then from there you could do some cross sells. You can do a course on traditional food elimination diet. You could do another cross sell on grocery items checklist or something. There's a lot of options that you can do there. Again, the point is you are getting an instant customer. Right?\
\
[00:13:38.730] - Dr. Destini Copp\
You're getting an instant customer. You're giving them easy way and easy yes to do business with you. And you can go on outside of this maybe a week or two down the road if you sell any consultations or if you even have higher price courses or whatever, you can add other things to this funnel. So let's talk about some other offers you can promote in a funnel like this, right. There's tons and tons of -- there tons and tons of options here.\
\
[00:14:12.050] - Dr. Destini Copp\
So let's say you are a nutrition coach or, you know, as part of your blog, you're getting into nutrition coaching you could do that. You could do a meal planning subscription. So in that funnel, let's say you have a membership where you do meal planning, perfect. You could do online courses. You could do workshops. You could do health and wellness webinars.\
\
[00:14:35.890] - Dr. Destini Copp\
You can even promote affiliate products through that funnel doesn't have to be right away, right. It could be in some of the follow up sequences. So dietary supplements and products, health tracking tools, any of those, any of those affiliate products you can promote in there just to keep them interested. You're providing them value, right?\
\
[00:14:56.820] - Dr. Destini Copp\
You could do an email, maybe even have a blog post out there that has really good information about a dietary supplement that you've already done. You could take that content repurpose it in an email put your affiliate links in there and there you go. You could do -- of course, you could do low-cost digital products like cookbooks and recipe guides. You could do a community membership, so maybe you have some type of community where people pay maybe $5 or $9 a month to be a part of. You could do a personalized nutrition assessment.\
\
[00:15:30.560] - Dr. Destini Copp\
So tons and tons of opportunities for something like that. Now, the next thing I will really want to touch upon which I think is very important in these automated sales funnels, is number one, being ethical but also adding your personal touch and I'm going to talk about how you can do that. Now, the first thing is you need to be very upfront and clear about what you're selling, right. You got to include information on the tripwire page, on the sales page there, right.\
\
[00:15:59.490] - Dr. Destini Copp\
They don't have a lot of time to make decision, but you want to be very upfront and clear. This is what you're going to be getting. If you have a refund policy, here's what it is. All of the legal disclaimers make sure that people know what they're actually signing up for. And then let's say that you have in that funnel somewhere down the line maybe you're selling a higher price course and you have a webinar in there. Maybe you have a chat feature in there where there are webinars that you can set up, that even though it's a recorded webinar, you can have a chat feature in there\
\
[00:16:38.270] - Dr. Destini Copp\
so if somebody is watching that recorded webinar, they can type in their question to you. It can go to your email and you can respond. So I have set up webinars like this in the past and people have gone through and watched them. They knew it was recorded, right, because I was very transparent.\
\
[00:16:53.960] - Dr. Destini Copp\
This is not a live webinar. They knew it was recorded. They typed in their question. It came to my email. I think one was like 9:30 at night.\
\
[00:17:00.790] - Dr. Destini Copp\
I responded back to her, she's like, wow, I didn't think I was going to get any response to that whatsoever. But you're just adding that personal touch. So you can do that even in these automated sales funnels. Now, I just touched upon it. You definitely got to be transparent.\
\
[00:17:17.350] - Dr. Destini Copp\
So I absolutely cannot stand it when I know that I am going through a recorded webinar and I know when that's happening because I'm savvy enough, right? I've been in this marketing world for a long time and the person who's doing the webinar is pretending like it's live. That just drives me crazy. That is unethical.\
\
[00:17:35.150] - Dr. Destini Copp\
Do not do that. And the other thing is, is I definitely would encourage you to use urgency, but don't be pushy. We're not here to pressure people, right, but you can definitely use urgency, and this is extremely ethical, definitely use urgency in these sales funnels. And here's another example of how you can do that.\
\
[00:17:58.460] - Dr. Destini Copp\
Now, I mentioned on the tripwire page generally you'll want to do 15 to 20 minutes. Let's say that somebody comes back and they want to purchase they can't you can still set it up so they can purchase, but it can just be at a different price. So maybe the trip wire offer was $27. Maybe the next price -- the next level is 37 or 47 or whatever the case may be. They can still purchase, but they don't get that special deal, right.\
\
[00:18:30.820] - Dr. Destini Copp\
The other option is, let's say that you have down the road in that sales funnel, you're selling a higher price course you still want to put a deadline on there because if you don't put that deadline, people won't make a decision. That is a proven fact in marketing. There's been a ton of research on it. So you still can have a deadline, but if somebody purchases within that deadline, you could give them some extra bonuses.\
\
[00:18:57.280] - Dr. Destini Copp\
That's an option, right? You can still, you know, give them a reduced price and if they come back to purchase later, they can get a higher price. But there's a lot of things that you can do to incent them and to reward the fast action takers, right. So incent them to make that decision quickly. Now, I want to talk about traffic strategies to get eyeballs on your funnel.\
\
[00:19:21.850] - Dr. Destini Copp\
And quite frankly, this is one of the most important things that you'll want to think about because what happens to a lot of folks is they set up this wonderful funnel, but nobody ever sees it. And then they think, what did I do wrong? Well, you didn't do anything wrong. The fact is nobody knows that it even exists. So, if you set one of these automated sales funnels up, you have to, you have to, and I cannot stress this enough, you have to make sure you're driving traffic to it.\
\
[00:19:49.610] - Dr. Destini Copp\
Obviously, you guys are bloggers you can drive traffic through your blog to it if you want to be a guest on a podcast, or maybe you want to start your own podcast. Pinterest is also a great way to drive traffic, organic search traffic to your funnels, free PR. So thinking about -- the other thing I love about free PR, not only does it drive traffic, it drives authority or builds authority because when people are listening to you on somebody else's podcast, they're looking up to you as an expert. So you could do guest podcasting. You can do speaking opportunities. You can do guest blogging. I know that a lot of you have probably already dipped your toes in that.\
\
[00:20:32.170] - Dr. Destini Copp\
That's a really great way to drive traffic to a free gift that you have. You can do quotes for high authority sites. I have a ton of media examples on my website if you want to go check that out, things that I've done over the years. The other thing, and this is one of my favorite ways to drive traffic, is through collaborations and affiliates so you can participate in a bundle.\
\
[00:20:56.990] - Dr. Destini Copp\
That's a great way to drive traffic to your free gifts thereafter your funnels, right? You could be a speaker at a virtual summit another great way to drive traffic. You can do joint Instagram and Facebook lives with somebody's -- and you can also drive traffic to your website and your gifts through other sources like Etsy, AppSumo, Amazon, those are ways I know. I've gone to purchase stuff on Etsy, gone to somebody's website, and entered their world from there.\
\
[00:21:31.710] - Dr. Destini Copp\
Now, once you get your sales funnel set up, I want you to go through it just like a new subscriber. You want to make sure that everything is working properly so go through all of your links. Go through all of your emails. Just make sure it's working perfectly. Have your friends go through it. Have your mother go through it.\
\
[00:21:53.120] - Dr. Destini Copp\
So have everybody, everybody go through it, test it out, make sure that it's working. And the other thing is you don't want to set it and forget it. So, you're going to want to monitor the data I would say at least on a monthly basis and tweak as necessary. So you'll want to look at things like your landing page. What's your conversion rate there?\
\
[00:22:14.170] - Dr. Destini Copp\
I like to see anywhere from like 45% up to 65%. That's generally what we see on our landing pages. A lot of it depends on the traffic, right, that's being driven to it and how aligned they are with the offer and what you have for your free gift. But that's one of the things you want to look at. You want to look at people who are actually seeing your tripwire offer, and how well is that converting.\
\
[00:22:41.070] - Dr. Destini Copp\
So that's going to convert anywhere from like five to maybe ten. If you got above that, you're doing extremely, extremely well. So you want to definitely look at it, monitor the data on a monthly basis and tweak as necessary. Now, I do have a free gift for you. This is a free planner for Plan Your Profitable Evergreen Sales Funnel so you can sell your digital products and programs on autopilot.\
\
[00:23:08.720] - Dr. Destini Copp\

**Transcript:**\
Eb Gargano [00:00:12]:\
Hi. I'm Eb Gargano from Productive Blogging. I am delighted to be here speaking again at the Blogger Breakthrough Summit. This year, I am gonna be talking about how to 10 x your blogging income without more traffic. Let's dive in, shall we? Okay. So before we get started, I want to ask you if you identify with any or all of the following statements. So a, I am not earning as much money as I would like to be earning, b, I live in constant fear of the next Google update, c, I feel like I'm on a perpetual hamster wheel working, working, working, but never getting any closer to my goals. D, every new curveball leaves me feeling like I want to cut my losses and throw in the towel.\
\
Eb Gargano [00:01:02]:\
So, if you identified with any or all of those statements, you are not alone. Making money online has become harder, more competitive, and less reliable over the last few years. And threats from AI, increasingly tough competition, and some pretty brutal Google updates recently mean the traditional blogging model is becoming ever more precarious and ever harder to win at. But what if I told you there is a way to break free from the overwhelm, frustration, and stress of that perpetual hamster wheel? What if I told you there is a way to completely stop worrying about Google updates and random curveballs? And what if I told you that it is completely possible to 10 x your blogging income without more traffic? It's time to get excited, very excited because what I'm about to reveal to you has the potential to change not just your blogging business but your whole life. Okay. So in this training, I am gonna show you the simple money making equation and why most bloggers are focusing on the wrong side of the equation, how to make good money online without living in fear of the next Google update, how to make your blogging business much less precarious and much more protected from those random curveballs, and most importantly, how to 10 x your blogging income without more traffic. But before we carry on, I want to very briefly introduce myself so that you know who I am, why I am qualified to talk about all of this. So for those of you who don't know me, my name is Eb Gugano and I'm the founder of Easy Peasy Foodie and Productive Blogging.\
\
Eb Gargano [00:02:55]:\
I'm also a course creator and ebook author. I've written 5 books and I've created 7 online courses and one membership program. And I teach bloggers and online business owners how to be more strategic with their time so they can earn more while working less. I've helped over 3,000 paying students build more successful online businesses through my ebooks, courses, and my membership program, the Digital Product Success Academy. And when I am not working, I love lifting weights, drinking wine, and learning Spanish on Duolingo, but not all at the same time. So I spend a lot of time talking to bloggers and online business owners. And whenever I ask them about their goals, so often the reply I get back is more traffic, increase my monthly page views, get more readers, hit 50,000 sessions. And there's a really good reason for that.\
\
Eb Gargano [00:03:56]:\
There's a strong correlation between page views and income, especially if your site is monetized by ads and or affiliates. But here's the thing, nobody really wants more page views. After all, you can't pay your mortgage with page views, you can't pay your bills with page views, You can't eat page views. Page views won't buy you a fancy car or a luxury holiday. Bloggers say they want more page views because more page views equals more money. But increasing your page views is only one half of the income equation and I would argue most of the time not the best one. You see, your blogging income is based on one simple calculation. Number of page views times the amount of money you make per page view.\
\
Eb Gargano [00:04:53]:\
The amount of money you make per page view is usually expressed as RPM, which technically means, rate per mille or rate per 1,000 page views. That means if you want to 10 x your blog income, there are 2 things you can do. Number 1, 10 x your blog traffic or number 2, 10 x your RPM. So let's look at each one of those in turn. First up, 10 x ing your blog traffic. If you currently earn money from your blog from ads and affiliates, then the most obvious way to 10 x your blog income is by 10 x ing your traffic. For example, if you currently get 50,000 page views and have an RPM of $20, you would be earning $1,000 per month. But if you had 500,000 page views, you would be earning $10,000 per month.\
\
Eb Gargano [00:05:48]:\
Now 10 x ing your traffic used to be relatively easy to do. You would just double down on your SEO, do lots of good keyword research, crank out lots of well written, well optimized posts, and in a fairly short space of time, you could significantly increase your monthly pages and therefore significantly increase your monthly blogging income. Unfortunately, thanks to huge increases in competition, major advances in AI, and some pretty brutal Google updates in recent years, 10 x ing your monthly traffic is now very hard and it's getting harder and harder to do. In fact, right now, many bloggers are actually going in the opposite direction. Worse still, the only real way of getting those kind of traffic numbers is Google. So trying to 10 x your traffic makes you ever more dependent on Google. And in the last couple of years, we've seen just how precarious that is. One of my favorite quotes is never put all your eggs in one basket, especially not Google's.\
\
Eb Gargano [00:07:02]:\
Relying on any one channel for all or nearly all of your traffic and income is not a business plan. It's a gamble. Never leave yourself at the mercy of any one channel or platform because you have no control over a third party. If one algorithm change can wipe out your entire business overnight, you're doing it wrong. So just a quick reminder, to 10 x your blogging income, you can do one of 2 things. 10 x your page views, which we've just looked at, or 10 x your RPM. So we've just looked at increasing your page views, which is the one that everyone talks about all of the time. So now let's look at the other one, 10x-ing your RPM.\
\
Eb Gargano [00:07:46]:\
So let's look at that example again. We already looked at how if you currently get 50,000 page views and have an RPM of $20, you would be earning $1,000 per month. And if you ten x your traffic and had 500,000 page views, you would ten x your blogging income and be earning $10,000 per month. But you could stay on that 50,000 page views figure and instead ten x your RPM. So if you have an RPM of $200 and 50,000 page views a month, you would also be earning $10,000 per month. But how on earth do you do that? How on earth do you get an RPM of $200? Actually, it's surprisingly easy. According to recent research, bloggers who mainly monetize via digital products are earning over 10 times as much as bloggers who mainly monetize via ads or affiliates. This is a graph taken from the blogging income survey and you can see that the RPMs you get from digital products absolutely dwarf those you get from ads and affiliates.\
\
Eb Gargano [00:09:02]:\
In fact, according to the data, the average RPM from digital products is $365.94, which means if you have 50,000 page views, you could be earning $18,297 a month from digital products compared to just $1,393 from ads. That is a lot more than 10 x. But why is that? Why are digital product RPMs so much higher than ad RPMs? It's actually quite logical when you think about it. People are only gonna pay to advertise their products if they will earn more from product sales than they will spend advertising their products which means the income per page view is being split between the website which displays the ads and the company paying for the ads. And usually, the company paying for the ads is earning a lot more than the website which displays the ads. Or to put it another way, if you run ads on your site, someone else is earning more from your page views than you are. Selling your own products cuts out the middleman. And the best news, creating and launching a digital product is much, much easier than trying to 10 x your traffic.\
\
Eb Gargano [00:10:32]:\
However, just throwing together a quick ebook and popping a link to it somewhere on your website will not magically 10 x your income. If you want to 10 x your blogging income, you need to be much more strategic. You need a step by step plan and that is what this presentation is gonna cover. How to 10 x your income without more traffic, a 4 step plan. Okay. So step 1 is build a solid email foundation. Email marketing is absolutely foundational to the success of a digital product based business. I literally cannot emphasize this enough.\
\
Eb Gargano [00:11:16]:\
If you get your email marketing wrong, your digital product business will almost certainly fail. Email marketing runs through every aspect of a successful digital product business. It will help you do market research, validate your ideas, nurture cold traffic into warm leads, and nurture warm leads into customers. It will also help you onboard your new customers, get good testimonials and success stories, and turn happy customers into advocates, repeat customers, and high performing affiliates. I literally do not know of a single successful digital product business owner who does not have a strong email marketing game. So what does a solid email marketing foundation look like? It looks like this. Multiple high converting lead magnets, a strong new subscriber nurture sequence, a good tagging and segmenting strategy to ensure the right subscriber gets the right email at the right time, automations that ensure that new subscribers are guided along a path from new subscriber to happy customer to repeat customer to raving advocate and high performing affiliate. Okay.\
\
Eb Gargano [00:12:34]:\
That was step 1. Step 2 is create a product ladder. You see, the thing is you are very unlikely to 10 x your blogging income if you only sell one product. If that product is a low cost product like an ebook, you would need huge traffic volumes to achieve that 10 x figure. But if you only sell one high ticket offer like a signature program, though you need far fewer sales to make a decent income, it is really hard to sell any at all because people just don't trust you enough to part with that much money. So what's the solution? The solution is to build a product ladder. But what is a product ladder? A product ladder is a series of products that takes your target audience step by step along a journey from just stumbling across your website right up to the point where they trust you enough to buy your high ticket offer. Here's an example of what that might look like.\
\
Eb Gargano [00:13:34]:\
It starts with your free product, a lead magnet designed to turn casual website visitors into subscribers and give them a quick win. The next rung on the ladder is your low ticket offer, A small product like an ebook that's priced so low that it doesn't require much trust to get the sale. The next rung is your mid price offer. A slightly bigger, slightly more expensive product like a mini course. This will give your customer bigger results and build even more trust. And finally, the top rung is your high ticket offer. This delivers the biggest results for your customers. However, it also has the biggest price tag.\
\
Eb Gargano [00:14:18]:\
But because you've built up so much trust along the way, your customers will be willing to pay that price because they know how much value they'll get. Okay. So that is what a product ladder is, but why does it work so well? Well, the thing is the hardest part of all of this is to get people to make the leap from non customer to customer, to go from free product to low ticket offer which is why you price your low ticket offer so attractively, to make it as friction free as possible for someone to make that leap. Once they've made that leap, it is so much easier to sell them something more expensive. If they give you a small amount of money and your product really exceeds their expectations and gives them a significant win, they will be much more likely to trust you with a larger amount of money in the future. It's also easier for you. Creating a signature program if you've never made any kind of digital product before is a huge step and a huge risk. If you get it wrong, that's a lot of time and money that you've wasted.\
\
Eb Gargano [00:15:33]:\
By starting small with a low ticket offer, it's less daunting and much less of a risk for you. Better still, you can use the feedback you get from your low ticket offer customers to help you understand your audience better and create better higher ticket offers. This makes the whole process much less risky because you have a better understanding of what your audience truly wants and is willing to pay for and proof that they will actually buy from you. And it makes success with your higher ticket products much more likely because you've gained that trust and because it's so much easier to sell to an existing customer than a non customer. Okay. So step 3 is launch your products the right way. All too often, I see people try to launch digital products by maybe sending one email to their list, maybe doing a little bit of social media, and sticking their new product on their website somewhere, and that's it. That is not a launch and that approach is doomed to failure.\
\
Eb Gargano [00:16:43]:\
A proper launch involves a lot more razzmatazz. It involves warming up your list way before your launch. It involves sending emails to your list daily during your launch period. It involves promoting your product on your website and across multiple social channels, and it involves a discount and a deadline. A deadline is really important. Without a deadline, your audience have no incentive to buy now. And we as humans are natural procrastinators. So without a deadline, your audience may see your fabulous new digital product and think, oh, that looks wonderful.\
\
Eb Gargano [00:17:25]:\
I am definitely gonna get that tomorrow. But then tomorrow rolls around and they get the next email from you and they think, oh, that looks wonderful. I'm definitely gonna get that tomorrow. But then tomorrow rolls around and they get the next email from you and they think, oh, that looks wonderful. I'm definitely gonna get that tomorrow, and so on. By giving your audience a special launch discount and a deadline after which they can no longer get that discount, they are motivated to act now and they do. And if you want any more evidence for that, ask any digital product creator when they get the most sales and they will tell you in the last hour of the sale. And finally, step 4 is to build an evergreen sales funnel because once you've done your launch, you cannot expect sales to keep rolling in.\
\
Eb Gargano [00:18:20]:\
It just doesn't work like that. You're gonna hit up against that exact same problem. New people will discover your website and your products and they will think, oh, that digital product looks wonderful. That's really gonna help me. I am definitely gonna get that tomorrow. But without any kind of deadline, they just won't have any kind of incentive to stop putting that purchase off and so they will keep procrastinating and eventually, probably forget all about you. So what is the solution? Well, you could run a flash sale on your digital product several times a year. But there's a fundamental problem with this.\
\
Eb Gargano [00:18:58]:\
Once people discover that you run regular flash sales on your products, the power of urgency is lost. And they will think, oh, I'll just wait for the next flash sale, and the next, and the next. Also, after a time, people come to know you offer regular flash sales and so nobody ever buys at full price. In other words, you have devalued your product. So what is the solution? The solution is to build an evergreen sales funnel. But what is an evergreen sales funnel? An evergreen sales funnel is a type of sales funnel that is automated and can be entered at any time. Typically, you attract people into the top of your sales funnel with a free lead magnet. Once on your list, you will first welcome and nurture your new subscriber before presenting them with an offer, usually a discount off your digital product for a limited time.\
\
Eb Gargano [00:19:56]:\
The sales funnel is evergreen because this limited time period is individual for each new subscriber and available all year round. Whenever anyone signs up for your free lead magnet, they'll be given exactly the same amount of time to buy the product at the discount. Once the countdown timer has hit 0, the discount will automatically disappear and they will only have the option to pay full price. So for example, person 1 might sign up for your freebie on Monday 1st at 9 AM and they are presented with an offer, let's say, 50% off your course if they sign up by Saturday 6th at 9 AM. Now, person 2 then signs up for your freebie on Tuesday 2nd at 5 PM and they are presented with the exact same offer, 50% of your course, but they have until Sunday 7th at 5 PM to take advantage of that deal. And then, person 3 signs up for your freebie on Wednesday 3rd at 11 PM. And again, they are presented with the exact same offer, 50% of your course, but person 3 has until Monday 8th at 11 PM to take advantage of the deal. In other words, no matter when a person arrives in your sales funnel, they will be presented with the exact same offer and have the exact same amount of time to take advantage of the offer.\
\
Eb Gargano [00:21:27]:\
Once the deadline has passed and the countdown timer hits 0, they will no longer be able to access the discount, and they will only have the option to pay full price for your digital product. It's kind of like each new subscriber entering your sales funnel has their own personalized flash sale. But why build an evergreen sales funnel? Well, the short answer is because they work. They enable you to sell a lot more products and earn a lot more money, and yet they enable you to work a lot less because once you've set one up, it runs entirely on autopilot. Who wouldn't want that? And the reason why evergreen sales funnels work so much better than regular flash sales is because they're only available to new subscribers. Every new subscriber who joins your list by signing up for one of your lead magnets is offered a limited time discount on your product. If they don't take you up on your offer within the limited time window, your product is then only available to them at full price. People soon learn that when you offer a discount, it really is only available for the short time period you specify.\
\
Eb Gargano [00:22:39]:\
And so that real sense of urgency is reinforced and they are much more likely to buy. Okay. So I know the title of this presentation is how to 10 x your blogging income without more traffic. But it would be remiss of me not to talk about what to do after you have built your product ladder and your evergreen sales funnel. Once that is all built, you then have what I call a sales system that is almost completely passive. And if you are already getting good traffic volumes, that system should help you 10 x your RPM and so 10 x your blogging income. But what then? Well, then you can turn your attention to getting even more traffic to the top of your funnel and further increasing your digital product income. And because of the nature of digital products, your focus is much less on the quantity of traffic and much more on the quality of traffic.\
\
Eb Gargano [00:23:39]:\
Or in other words, a 100 highly targeted perfect customers are worth far more to you than a 100000 Google traffic randoms. And this means you need a whole lot less traffic to make a digital product business viable, which in turn makes you a whole lot less dependent on Google for your traffic. And because you don't need those crazy high traffic volumes that only Google can bring, it opens up lots of other traffic sources. For example, Pinterest traffic, social media traffic, podcasts, summits, bundles, webinars, collaborations, guest posting, even paid ads. None of these traffic sources work very well when you monetize via ads and affiliates because they just don't send the kind of high traffic volumes you need to make ads and affiliates pay. But if you monetize by digital products which have a much higher RPM, these alternative traffic sources can work really, really well, often even better than Google. Okay. Something I'm hearing a lot at the moment is, I'm doing okay at the moment.\
\
Eb Gargano [00:24:50]:\
I'll worry about all of this in the future if and when my Google traffic goes south. But here's the thing. Building a successful digital product based business is not something you can turn on overnight. It actually takes quite a long time. Depending on where you are now, how much traffic you get, how strong your email list is, how engaged your audience is, it can take 6 months to a year. If you get hit by the next Google algorithm update, do you really want to wait a whole year before you are earning money from your blog again? And also, if you move right now, you'll be moving before most other bloggers. And so if and when there's some almighty shock in the future, the next Google update, changes to third party cookies, new developments in AI, etcetera, etcetera, you'll be established when other bloggers start flooding into the market which will give you a massive competitive advantage. Okay.\
\
Eb Gargano [00:25:50]:\
So I appreciate I have very much skimmed the surface here. I try to give you as much value as I can but there's just a limit to what I can give you in a 30 minute presentation. The truth is there are a lot of moving parts to building a successful digital product based business and unless you do them all, you are very unlikely to get anywhere near that 10 x figure. But if you've been inspired by this presentation and you want to 10 x your blogging income by diversifying into digital products, if you want to stop worrying about Google updates, and if you want to build a more sustainable and less precarious business that is built on assets you own rather than borrowed traffic and third party algorithms, I have just the thing to help you succeed, the digital product starter kit.

Liz Stapleton [00:00:00]:\
Alright. Emma, thank you so much for joining us today. I really appreciate you taking the time. Oh, I'm so excited to be here. Thank you for inviting me.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:00:06]:\
Yes. No. I've been a fan of yours for a long time. I can't even remember. first came across you, but you're, like, in my mind, you're, like, copywriting pro. I feel like it must've been in another summit or Ultimate Bundles or something. I don't know. But I feel like I'm gonna wear it for a really long time. I'm so excited that you were able to join the summit too. So today, you're gonna be talking about sales paid at me because, obviously, you know, as bloggers, we tend to think about content and stuff, but eventually, it gets to the point where you're selling product. and doing a sales page. You know, it's a whole another, like, set of skills.\
\
Emma Lee Bates [00:00:39]:\
It really is. Yeah. I see so many bloggers who think, like, they can just take their skills, writing blog posts, and transfer it to a sales page, and it really is a completely different animal.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:00:49]:\
It is. Yeah. because I it's something I struggle with. And so I'm I'm getting all these people on the summit that I can then learn from. But, yeah, so can you tell us a little bit kind of what you're gonna be covering in your session today or time an anatomy of sales page. Can you just kind of break down some of the the top points you'll be covering?\
\
Emma Lee Bates [00:01:06]:\
Yeah. So I I really I focus a lot above the fold and what should be immediately visible when people land on your page. and I give a bunch of examples at the end. So make sure you stick around because I do go through some other people's sales pages and, landing pages that I really like and think they've done a good job. so it's a great way to sort of have a template to start with if you have one that you really like. And, Yeah. So so those are sort of the main things we go over.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:01:36]:\
Awesome. Well, I'm super excited to to go ahead and get started.\
\
Emma Lee Bates [00:01:39]:\
Alright. Thanks. Welcome. I am Emma Lee Bates, and this is my talk anatomy of a high converting sales page. Many people ask me, how do you know what is high converting? What conversion rate should you be aiming for, and how do you even figure it out? A sales page, trip wire page, should be getting a 3 to 5% average conversion rate. Something like your freebie page is going to be much higher. You can aim for something like 60 to 70%. but for a sales page, 3-5% is average. It does depend on your industry and your traffic. So your industry, something like a high end electronic company is going to have a different aid online gift shop. Why? Because when you're purchasing high end electronics, you're gonna do research. You're going to look around about at different reviews, and it's going to be something that you've put some thought into. So when you land on the page, you're gonna be ready to buy more likely than not. An online gift shop is something that you might browse. You're gonna buy if something catches your eye or maybe, you know, if there's a holiday coming up and you know, you need to get something but it's not something that you're really gonna research beforehand. It's not something that, is going to be a pre sought out purchase in most cases. Your traffic is also gonna be a big consideration. If you are sending an email sequence to your list of email fans and they're engaged and They know who you are, you're gonna have a higher conversion rate than cold traffic from Facebook ads. People who know you already have that no like and trust factor, whereas cold traffic, they are gonna be a little more hesitant. They are going to want to, you know, maybe they're gonna Google you to see who you are before they buy. Alright. So the basic anatomy of a sales page. This is a simple sales page template that I put together. starts with your headline and a buy button and moves into fears and desires, talking directly to your ideal customer about what they are experiencing right now and what they'd like to experience after solving that problem. then there's another buy button with an urgency timer. You know, that that's a, optional thing, but it can help if you have a open close cart to let people know that there is a deadline. then you're going to say you're, you know, welcome to what the product is. You're gonna give a brief overview. You're gonna talk about the benefits, and then you can go into some content bullet points. After that, you wanna make sure you have some testimonials, photos of maybe the product, or people using the product. then it's great to have some results, whether it's you know, more testimonials, a case study, then you can have an about me section, another testimonial, and then finally your buy button and urgency timer at the end of the page. This is just sort of a basic sales page, but it shows you sort of the different sections that I might usually use. Also, we're gonna be talking about the, that above the fold section of your sales page. And on this, it would be from the headline down to the urgency timer. That would probably be above your fold. Alright. So your headline, an attention grabbing headline that encourages them to keep reading. Alright. sometimes you might have a headline that is the name of the course of product and then a subheading that encourages you to keep reading, but you wanna make sure that the top of your page compels them to keep reading. So you want to make your headline really interesting. You wanna be talking to your ideal customer. It's great to touch upon a pain point I like to ask a question a lot. It makes people stop and think because they need to close that that open loop when there's a question asked of them. Powerwords are really great to use in headlines. If you Google Powerwords, there are lists of, like, you know, 800 power words you can use. So, you know, take a look at those and and choose some that are your favorites, some that would really appeal to your ideal customer. and use those in your headlines or subheadings. And then this is my biggest tip. Don't stop at one headline. Brainstorm\
\
Emma Lee Bates [00:05:48]:\
20 to 30 headlines. Just keep writing them out. You know, maybe you're just changing 1 or 2 words. Maybe you're trying. asking a question, you're trying, you know, a formula, you're focusing on a fear, you're focusing on a desire, but really write on a whole bunch of headlines and then figure out which one you like best. Maybe you combine a couple. Maybe you have, you know, what is a headline? What is the subheading? But it's gonna get a much better result if you take the time to really brainstorm a whole bunch of ideas. The next section we're gonna talk about is the above the fold section. there are three things that you wanna make sure are answered above the fold. What it is, who it's for, and a way to buy it. Alright. So what it is, make sure people can tell right away. You know, is this a service, an ebook, a course? What is it people are gonna land on your page sometimes, and they really they're not gonna know who you are. They're not gonna know the types of things you offer. So make it pretty obvious, you know, what it is that you are selling and what it will do for them. So how will it make their life easier? This is those fears and desires I was talking about. You know, if you focus on where they are now and then talk about where they could be after using your product or service, that's gonna really help them understand how this product is important for them to consider buying. The other thing is who is it for? The number of times I've landed on a page and start reading and be like, I have no idea whether this is something for me or not. Make it really obvious. It doesn't have to be like, you know, this is for virtual assistants. You don't have to make it that obvious, but using language that virtual assistants would know or using you know, references to the work at home life or, some way that people are going to start getting the idea whether or not this is for them. And then finally, I know some people say you shouldn't put a button until further down the page so people read, but so often people are coming to your page, you know, Either they're intrigued and they wanna know exactly, you know, how much this costs, whether this is something they can afford, or they would like you know, they've already been convinced that, you know, they love you, they wanna buy your next thing, and you don't wanna have to make them scroll and scroll and scroll to buy it. So I always say put a button above the fold so that people who are ready to buy can buy right away. Alright. So the next thing to talk about is social proof. This needs to be on every sales page. I'll even put social proof on landing pages for free products sometimes. The more people can see that you are a real person who helps people, the better off you are. So ways you can put social proof in, there are, of course, like, apps that you can add to different types of sites that will put a little pop up in the bottom corner that says, you know, so and so bot or so and so join the list. but you don't have to, like, invest in one of those. Get some testimonials. People who have worked with you I mean, I know I do it for people all the time. I love to provide a testimonial if I if somebody has helped me or, you know, provided me with excellent service. So don't be afraid to reach out to people that, you know, worked with you or studied, you know, your courses are material before. The, the thing people ask a lot is if you are releasing a new product? How do you get testimonials or reviews? Do a beta launch. having that feedback before you do a major launch is really important, not just for getting testimonials, but also to make sure you've worked out the kinks, you know, I mean, you're gonna launch stuff and there's gonna be there's gonna be stuff people don't understand. And if you do a beta launch and you take the time to make it really, really good, you're gonna get better results overall. I do believe that beta launches should be paid because people invest in the things, mentally that they've invested in financially. So, you know, it doesn't have to be a ton of money, but definitely a paid beta launch is gonna get you the best, testimonials and reviews. So testimonials is gonna be something the customer write and provides to you. A review could be something that they post on Facebook, they do in a blog post, or, you know, some something like that. So they are, similar, but a review can be more of a public thing than a testimonial might be. make sure you ask people before you put them on your page I know there are some templates out there to get a, like, a testimonial re testimonial release form. You could do that if you feel you need to be protected. but they are, you know, really great for a sales page. It really helps bring in that social proof. A couple of other things that you can do is a case study. So if you have somebody you've worked with and you have the ability to screenshot, you know, maybe their sign ups increased or their subscribers or they made more money. If you have some sort of, visual that you can screenshot and share on the page, that can be really powerful, especially if you can write up a you know, a story about where they were and you worked with them and then hear some proof on the changes that happened for them. And then lastly, a personal experience Be careful not to put this too close to the top of the page. You want it down a little bit. The top of the page should really focus on who the reader is and what their experience will be like. You wanna talk about their fears and desires. But further down, you can talk about your own experience, you can tell your story, you can tell how you developed this, or you know, how you finally dive in to learn what it is you learn and you can really, you know, tell that story as a a strong suggestion that you know what you're talking about. One of the places I really see a lot of people struggle on their sales page is bullet points. So I wanted to take a few minutes and go over the benefits of bullet points and how to write better ones. the first thing to know about bullet points is you need them. They make a sales page really easy to scan. A lot of people will stop and look at bullet points because they're usually kind of short to the point, they can get something out of it. And then if they're interested, they'll go back and read longer paragraphs. So you definitely wanna have multiple places where you have bullet points on your page. They are, as I said, easy to read. They highlight benefits and they create a break for the eye. The best bullet points create an open loop for the reader. An open loop is a question that the mind naturally longs to answer. one of the reasons that I ask questions in the headline because it is something that people naturally want to finish. When a bullet point is well written, it answers one question and brings up a second, or it creates curiosity about how something is possible. A few types of bullet points, the 2 step bullet point, an elaboration on the main benefit, and I'll tell you all I'm gonna show you again at the end what I'm talking about, but all of these bullet points came from one of my very favorite copywriting books called, how to write copy that converts by Ray Edwards. so you should look that up if you wanna get better at bullet points. Okay. So the 2 step bullet point. An example would be how to create standard operating procedures in your business. Parenthesis, you've been wasting time, energy, and money doing it wrong. Okay. So it's telling you a feature, right, how to create standard operating procedures. And then it's telling you something that is sort of a hint as to what you might learn inside. It's creating an open loop, you know, because you ask yourself, what am I doing wrong? I thought I was doing this. Right? What am I missing? So it creates a little intrigue. It creates some curiosity about what is inside. So this is the first type of bullet point that I love. The second type is the single most bullet point. This can be used when you have proven results. So if you have something with a case study that has proved your you know, your point or, something that's been tested, you can say something like the single most effective way to appear powerful on camera, tested by Harvard University. you know, in this case, that's a big name, Harvard University. So people are gonna know what that is, but it doesn't necessarily have to be something that sort of intense. It could be, you know, tested by my previous students, and then you show the proof, you know, you show them screenshots and case studies and that type of stuff. But it is a great way to give, a lot of power to what you're teaching or sharing. Alright. The next type of bullet point I really love is the how to bullet point. It's simple, but you need to make sure to include why the reader should care. So this is what I was talking about before with features and benefits when you want to tell them what it is and why should they should care. For example, how to quickly grow your Facebook book group with true fans. Okay. Why they should care is so you can explode your income. Things that people care about most are saving time, saving money, and making money, things that are basic needs, especially, you know, in real life, you know, finding food, finding relationships, that type of thing. The last one I have here is called is an the number bullet point. When you show multiple ways of doing something or multiple reasons why. So this would be, like, the 3 most important reasons that you need to plan before you launch your next product. So, you know, this can be the 3 most important mistakes, you know, or the 3 most common mistakes that people make in real estate. It could be the 3 most, devastating, you know, examples of people not following, you know, my, method type of thing. But you use a number, they say that using odd numbers is better. So, like, 5, 7, 9\
\
Emma Lee Bates [00:15:46]:\
but it really, you know, a number is powerful. A list is powerful. This is why places like Buzzfeed, you know, make a killing because they are all listicles and people are attracted to that. Okay. So you need to use different kinds of bullet points. You wanna use a group of bullet points to be you want a group of bullet points to be related by topic. You you but use a variety of types of bullet points to keep people interested in what you are saying. So you don't wanna have, you know, 5 bullet points all starting with the 3 most, the 5 most, the 7 most. You know, that's boring. That's not mixing it up. You wanna make sure that your group of bullet points has diversity. Practice. Practice practice. Practice. Just like the headlines, you wanna write out a lot of bullet points. you know, keep writing them down. When I sit down to write a sales page, you know, I'll start with a whole bunch of bullet points, and keep adding to them as I go and then, you know, mix them up and try to figure out where they go on the page. I usually have a features and benefits section. You might have, you know, a section with what's included. you know, you can have a section with the, you know, the biggest benefits for people or, you know, things that your students or clients did after they worked with you, all sorts of different types of bullet points are really good to include, and it's good to use an odd number of bullet points in each group. Alright. So How to Write Copy that Sells by Ray Edwards is where I got all these bullet going tips. He has I think over 20 types of bullet points in that book, and it is really, like, I go back and reference it all the time. It's my very favorite. So if you wanna write better bullet points, then definitely check out that section of his book. So next up is the journey. This is gonna take your customers from where they are now to where they could be after purchasing your offer. You wanna focus on the transformation for them. This is that, you know, this is where you are right now, and I would like to take you to this place. So it is a talking about the, features and benefits of your, product or service. this is, I like to think of it as what it is and why they should care. So if you list something like they're gonna get a workbook, then you would say, you know, 80 page workbook so that you can practice all of the techniques that I have taught you in the course. You wanna tell them exactly why this is gonna benefit them by telling, you know, by having that because so that and then focus on them. use language in terms that help them self identify. I talked a little bit about the focus on using words so they know whether it is for them. And this is the same type of thing. You want to focus on words that they're gonna relate to, terms that they're gonna relate to, If you have been in your niche, a long time, it can be hard to go back to the beginning. And so when you are writing your sales page, it can be really helpful to identify some people who are in that early stage that you can talk to, you know, reach out and say, hey, can we just get on a coffee chat? I'd love to kind of you know, figure out what terms that you're using to describe things. It's a great way to make sure that you are meeting them where they are and not using language that you know, but they are gonna be confused. And then finally, in your personal experience, in your about section, you know, your bio towards the end of the page, really share how your life story is, changed by what you learned or, you know, what you're teaching. So, you know, talk about your story in terms of how your life has changed on this topic. It's I'm being general, so it's a lot to figure out how to how to word that. But you don't wanna just say, you know, Emma Bates lives in New Hampshire with 3 kids, you wanna say, Emma Bates finally got tired of trying to write copy that converts, and she invested in a copywriting coach. I'll show you my bio in a little bit. Alright. So let's jump into some examples. Alright. This first one is from my trip wire page. This page converts at about 10%. So it's got a really good conversion rating. I do start with the title of the product. It is a bundle of 3 products. There's a picture right there of it. And then I talk about it's a quick and dirty guide to building your 1st or next sales page. So this is gonna show you, you know, what it is. It's gonna show you how it can help you. You know, I'm talking about your your struggles. Do you struggle the right sales pages that make sense? constantly questioning your copy. Then I tell you how I'm gonna solve it. You know, it's it's gonna have, you're getting this discount and you're gonna get this bundle of stuff that's gonna help you. Alright. So this is from Monica Froese. It's her pin pin practical promotions primer. I really like this because she tells you exactly what this is. It's a 40 page promoted Pins primer, and it is a step by step guide for profitable promoted pins. So you know exactly what this is. You know, there is no question. It is a step by step guide. You're talking about promoted pins. You know, it's forty pages. You know exactly what you're getting. This is from Lauren at, Financial Best Life. This is for her workbook. I really like this headline. Set big goals with this free workbook. So you know right away. Okay. I'm I'm setting goals. You're on a financial site. And so you know, these are gonna bite financial goals, life goals. and then, you know, it gets down into the nitty gritty. you know, once you fill up this workbook, you'll know what steps to take to make a difference in your life. That, you know, that's a big selling point for people. Alright. This one I love, this is from Rosemarie Groner, and I think her headline is genius. Your decision in the next forty 2 seconds is critical. I mean, like, how much drama is that? I think it's so great because, I mean, you read that and you're like, oh my god. I gotta know, what am I deciding? You know, what is what is so important on this page? And, you know, then she dives right in, free access, easy to implement budgeting system. I mean, I know exactly what it is. She thinks it's a big deal, and I gotta make a decision. So, you know, Okay. I'm gonna press that free instant access button. Here is the bio that I was talking about. So you know, this is on my course page and then talk about, I finally got fed up with being afraid to write sales copy. I hired a copywriting coach and worked hard for 3 months until it finally clicked. This is how I sort of became the expert in what I could, you know, present here. point of my bio is to introduce people to the fact that I have been where they are. I struggled. I found a way to learn what I needed to learn, and now I'd like to help them. And then at the end, you know, I tack on. I have 3 kids and I run an online business, but the point of my about section is really how I can help other people. Alright. And then here is a section from Stupid Simple SEO where he has some great, testimonials. So, you know, he's got the person's picture, a great, very succinct quote from them, you know, hands down one of the best deep dives SEO courses I have seen. It's full of information. I haven't seen anyone else talk about. You know, I mean, that one sentence, but it's a great review. And he's made it really clear that these are real people, you know, that he's got a picture, and then he's got their business name. This is another way that you could do social proof. This is from April Lewis. She screenshots. Facebook posts and, Facebook messages and she puts them on her sales page. You can really see exactly, you know, peep what people are saying. It's not, like, generically, she's got their names and stuff, but, you know, it gives you a really clear idea of what people say about her. Okay. So then the last thing I want to talk about is conversion conversion copywriting. how do you move from knowing your ideal customer to writing to your ideal customer? Is sales copy different than writing a blog post or email? The answer is yes. sales copy is a really different animal. And the the fact that you can write doesn't mean that you know how to write sales copy. You can learn it, obviously. I mean, it's not hard, but it is very different than writing to share information, writing to encourage people to buy takes, a different focus. So I'm going to go over a little bit of that right now. Yes. Okay. So how is sales copy different, and how do you know what to write? First of all, it's all about them. The biggest mistake that I see when people sit down to write a landing page, sales page, trip wire page, even a sales email is that they write about themselves. And that's natural. I mean, you know, we as humans are concerned about ourselves, most of all. But The sales page needs to convince somebody else to buy, which means you need to make it all about them. Don't write your own story near the top of the page. It's okay to include it further down, but you wanna take the top of the page and really focus on the reader. So you wanna write about their fears and desires. You wanna write about their transformation that's possible. You wanna write about their journey. You need to write what they want to hear. Okay. Next is focus on transformation. How will your product or service help them? This is where you really need to write about what is possible with your service or your program. What is the end result gonna be? You need to focus on it in a really positive way. don't use language that justifies. you don't wanna be, like, justifying, justifying your price or anything like that. You really wanna be focused on how their lives will be better after they go through your product, your service, whatever it is. Use social proof. Like I said, testimonials, case studies, stories, things that have, proof that is from other people is really important. Anything that you can do to increase your reader's trust in you on a sales page and having other people vouch for you is a really great way to do that. So that would be something that I would make sure to have. even if you're new, if you're starting out, get some testimonials or reviews. Use formulas. Okay. If you search up copywriting formulas, you're gonna find a whole ton of them out there. PAS is, pain agitate solve. So that would be bringing up the pain where they are now really talking about it and agitating it out of their system and then tell them how they can solve it using what you are trying to sell. That is a very popular one. Another popular one is attention, interest, desire, action, or a ADIA. I never know quite how to pronounce it. but that one is it's similar. You wanna get their intention You wanna increase their interest in your product or service, you want to create a desire for it, and then you wanna encourage them to take action. Next is pain points. I think people get stuck with what pain points are. This is a great chance to go talk to people who are potential customers, potential clients, and find out what they're really struggling with, find out what their biggest pain points are. You know, pain point could be that, you know, they're they're overwhelmed with getting started in something. A pain point could be they don't have confidence that they can do something. a pain point could be that they need to make money from home and have you know, no idea how you even start researching that. You know, pain points aren't necessarily, you know, like, physical pain or, like, mental anguish, but it is something that's causing comfort in their life, and you wanna be able to talk about what that discomfort is and how they could solve it. and then break it up. Don't use big paragraphs. You know,\
\
Emma Lee Bates [00:28:09]:\
3 maybe 5 sentences per paragraph is plenty. you wanna make sure you give the eye plenty of white space. You wanna break up, the text into sections you know, with different colored backgrounds, with lines between them, stuff so that people who are scanning, you know, stuff will catch their eye, they'll read a chunk. You know, they might not read everything on a page. That's really typical, but you wanna make sure you're giving them places for their eye land, places that will catch their attention. Okay. So I have a few gifts for you now. if you download my freebie freebie, you're gonna get the sales page anatomy workbook. It includes a conversion tracker, a sales page checklist, some headline formulas, and that sales page template I showed you at the beginning. So I hope you learned some stuff and got some great stuff out of this, and have a great rest of the summit.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:28:54]:\
Alright, Emma. Thank you. That was fantastic. I learned so much. about sales page anatomy. And I'm really excited because you are offering a free conversion tracker for sales page, which link is below. But just, I mean, So I have a word.\
\
Emma Lee Bates [00:28:54]:\
Yes. So I have a a conversion tracker. It has the formula to help you figure out how to track your page, and then, you know, you can record it each month. and then I also I record what I tweet.\
\
Emma Lee Bates [00:29:21]:\
So if I make a change to the headline, I'll write that down and then check next month and see if that helped or hurt. and I'm also including the slides from this presentation. so that if you wanna really check out some of the examples, you can get up close and personal.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:29:20]:\
Fantastic. That's great. Thank you so much, guys. Definitely check out emmaleebates.com. She's super awesome. Like I said, I've been following her here and there for years now, and we thank you again for for for doing this session. I appreciate it.\

**Transcript:**\
[00:00:13.910] - Gabby\
Hello and welcome. I'm Gabby Conde from acupofzen.com. Welcome to how to tap into your creativity for product creation. In this class, you'll will get inspired to create successful products and come up with ideas that your audience and your customers will love. So the question is, why use your creativity?\
\
[00:00:38.330] - Gabby\
Why not do what everyone else is doing out there? Well, I was going to post about what everyone else is doing out there in this class. But I went to go and see this movie with one of my daughters. It's called Shangchi. It's by Marvel, and it's the legend of the Ten Rings. And honestly, I didn't really want to go to see this movie.\
\
[00:01:02.210] - Gabby\
I was busy and had other things to do, but it meant a lot to my daughter. So, I went, and every time that I go to see a movie, I get inspired because I'm taking a break from the ordinary routine. And I'm doing something that is different. And so, I allow for ideas to come in. And as I was watching Shangchi, the idea for this talk today was to tap into your creativity to find what it is that is inside of you that is unique and needs to be shared with other people in your products. Because that is what's going to set you apart from your competition.\
\
[00:01:48.530] - Gabby\
And it's also going to really make you feel great about what you do in business. So, of course, Marvel was created by Stan Lee, who wrote Spiderman, who came up with Spiderman. I'm sure you've heard of Stan Lee. He has created so many characters. And one of the things that I've noticed about the movie industry is that they seem to run out of ideas.\
\
[00:02:17.630] - Gabby\
But if people tapped into their creativity and their imagination like Stan Lee did, they would have the most amazing films, just like the Marvel films. All of them are amazing and great. Of course, they have great writers that help to write the films and make them funny and relevant to modern times. It all started with Stan Lee when he decided to create his own comics and came up with all of these characters just out of his imagination. Stan Lee was also really practical.\
\
[00:02:51.890] - Gabby\
He would show up at a lot of comic conventions and be there. And I knew someone who got his drawing, I think he drew a Stan Lee signed by Stan Lee, and Stan Lee thought it was funny. And I think Stan Lee had this huge head dispenser, which was a likeness of him that used to sit on his table when he would go to conventions. So, I've heard this second hand.\
\
[00:03:18.530] - Gabby\
I didn't actually experience it. But Stan Lee is just an amazing creator who tapped into a lot of his ideas through his imagination. So, let his legacy inspire you to also tap into your ideas. And, of course, you may not be a comic book creator or a movie creator, but this is just an idea of what you can create through your imagination. Then there's Coca Cola.\
\
[00:03:50.570] - Gabby\
Coca Cola wouldn't have gotten started if it wasn't for experiments that they did to create the original Coca Cola. And they didn't just stop there. They didn't just make one product. They have, like, I think here in Atlanta at the Coca Cola Company, they have these taste tests. They have, like, over 100 different flavors, and some of them are not on the market. And some of them, I've heard, are really, really gross.\
\
[00:04:19.130] - Gabby\
But they kept creating. Their product development came up with so many different flavors to try out and see how they would do in the mainstream market. And the same may go for you. There may be some courses or some products that you create that flop. And there may be some products that create that build a legacy, like the original Coca Cola. You can see that they've added on several popular flavors since then, like Sprite and Doctor Pepper.\
\
[00:04:47.810] - Gabby\
They even have this core power and vitamin water. It looks like they must own Dunkin Donuts Coffee now, because that's here, too, as well as Fanta Gold Peak Tea, Smartwater, Minute made, Powerade. They also acquired other people's different brands, but they've come up with several different flavors all on their own. So, even if orange-flavored Coke may not go that great with people, there's always a vanilla Coke that does. So, even if you come up with a product that doesn't fly that well, there might still be a segment of the market who needs it and who wants it. And there might still be lasting product that you have that appeals to many more people.\
\
[00:05:37.670] - Gabby\
So, don't hold back on your ideas. Just go with the flow and see what comes up for you during this presentation. Another popular website. So, we don't just have to talk about products, but we can also talk about websites. Mashable founder Pete Cashmora.\
\
[00:05:54.770] - Gabby\
He created a news aggregation type of site, Mashable, that took a whole bunch of different topics and put them all together. But they're still transforming Mashable. They're still innovating in their industry. Slutty vegan, this is a restaurant that's here in Atlanta, and I believe it's actually nationwide now.\
\
[00:06:16.250] - Gabby\
I'm not sure maybe it expanded into some other places. They have really grown in popularity. And they've expanded their restaurant chain. And it all started from Aisha Cole here, who decided to create her own restaurant based on a vegan menu. And to be honest, it's not really popular around here.\
\
[00:06:40.310] - Gabby\
There's, like, Longhorn Steakhouse, and people go and get their steaks. Or there's Chilies and several other restaurant chains, restaurants are very competitive. But she decided to do it, and she did, and she's been really successful with it. So, believe in your ideas, no matter what they are, even if they come in fleeting and you know that there's some kind of thing there for you. Go for it.\
\
[00:07:06.830] - Gabby\
Oh, I should have included this. But one of my favorite guitars, Steve Vai. He had an idea for a song when he was learning guitar from Joe Satriani, and when he does a lot of instrumental work, not necessarily anything with words that much. So, his guitar is mostly instrumental. And so, he had this quick couple of notes that came in that he wrote down, and then he stored it away for quite a while.\
\
[00:07:47.270] - Gabby\
And now he used to tour with Frank Zappa, and he used to be with David Lee Rossban when David Lee Ross put up from Van Halen, and then eventually he decided to go solo. And so, when Steve Vai took out this old couple of notes that he had for the song, he expanded it into the most amazing song ever. And it's a song that he absolutely loves. And he said that he plays it every night, and that's just amazing, what your imagination can come up with. Here's another website that's really popular.\
\
[00:08:23.870] - Gabby\
It's Copy Blogger. Brian Clark came up with this website when he was studying copywriting, and he wanted to get these principles of copywriting out there. It started out where the site was just based on copywriting, but it's expanded into so much. Now they do hosting. They came up with a plugin called Scribe that helps people optimize their blog posts for SEO. And they've expanded beyond there to create several marketing courses. So, your imagination can do so much.\
\
[00:08:57.530] - Gabby\
You just have to tap into your creativity and make your product as unique as you are. It doesn't matter if you think that you know other people are more creative than you. Try not to look at what other people are doing. Just focus on you and what makes you unique, your story, the love that you put into your product, your creativity. As you get into that place of tapping into your creativity and into play.\
\
[00:09:23.690] - Gabby\
You will really enjoy the process of creating products. And you'll want to create them more and more and more as you get into it. So, let's get into the meat and bones of this class and how to get ideas. So, first, you want to know what your learning style is. Are you visual? Do you see things and then you come up with ideas.\
\
[00:09:45.410] - Gabby\
Maybe you see websites, or you see performances, or you see a movie and you come up with ideas. Are you more auditory where you can listen to an audiobook and get a bunch of ideas from that? Or maybe you listen to a Ted talk or you listen to some song and you get ideas from that. Are you kinesthetic? And you actually have to go through the process of learning like, you go through the process of learning what it is that you do.\
\
[00:10:14.810] - Gabby\
Maybe you do social media. You go through the process of learning social media, and that's how you learn and you see different connections from doing that. Or are you all up to above? Maybe you use all of these different ways to learn and to develop your own type of process for creating products. So, whichever one it is, you can also look at these websites to get more ideas.\
\
[00:10:41.990] - Gabby\
So, there's Pinterest. And Pinterest has a ton of products on there and blog posts that you can go and get a bunch of ideas. So, here's an idea of how it works. I just typed in planners and then look at all of these different pins that come up that are exciting. And look at all of the different ideas. There's self-care.\
\
[00:11:05.570] - Gabby\
There's gold tracking. Look, there's a water type of tracker. There's a weekly planner, so you can see there's a daily planner. There's all kinds of ideas that you can get just from looking at that. Then there's Etsy.\
\
[00:11:20.930] - Gabby\
And the same goes for Etsy. You can use Etsy to really quickly find so many different ideas. So, I just typed in planners on Etsy, and you can see that there's a digital planner. There's another digital planner. So, it looks like digital planners are really popular right now.\
\
[00:11:40.130] - Gabby\
They're coming up on the first page when I typed in Planner, there's also ADHD planner, a life changing planner. The everything bundles to plan your life. There's tons of ideas that you can get just from typing in your keywords on Etsy.\
\
[00:11:58.910] - Gabby\
So, for more visual elements, I like going to creative market, and they have published that usually their most popular products are shown on the first page. So, if you scroll down, you can see what some of the staff picks and then really popular graphics here. So, this can give you ideas of what to create, or it can also give you design ideas as well. So, you can see some of the popular fonts right now, and looks like those are some blog posts. So, there's some design trends, color of the season.\
\
[00:12:38.210] - Gabby\
So, if you come on here and you choose whichever category you want to look at, these are the ones that show up on the first page are usually the most popular. So, you can get some ideas from Creative Market as well. And then, of course, there's Google. So, if you go to Google and you type in your keywords, you can see that Google will populate other keywords right behind the keyword that you put in. So, there's planners 2021, planners for men, which is a different segment of the market that might be good to tap into.\
\
[00:13:14.870] - Gabby\
There's planners for kids, planners with stickers, planners Aaron Conrad, planners that start in July, and planners for work. So, there's a lot of different ideas that you can get from Google that you might not have thought of before, like, I wouldn't have thought that kids need planners. But if you think about it, the school that my youngest daughter goes to, they do give out planners at the beginning of the year to help them keep track of their homework. So that could be a good idea to create some planners for kids.\
\
[00:13:49.430] - Gabby\
Planners with stickers are popular. So, if you scroll down, you'll also see pages that you can click on. There's planners at Target. There's planners on Amazon. Those are both great sites to also get ideas from and check out as well as looking at the ads here in the Google ads, the Google Shopping Marketplace. You can get ideas from these to see what people are listening in the ads.\
\
[00:14:14.510] - Gabby\
And then if you scroll down, you can find even more ideas from some of these different websites. If you click on them, you'll probably find a shop full of different planners, so you can get ideas from what they're listing as well.\
\
[00:14:32.330] - Gabby\
I always visit my competitors to see what it is that they're listing because they give me ideas as well. They might cover a topic that I haven't covered and then I'll think, oh, I really want to do that. Oh, that's a good topic. You know schedule it put it in my schedule and then done. I've got an idea, you know right there.\
\
[00:14:55.610] - Gabby\
You don't have to be alone doing this. You can look at other people's stuff and get ideas from that. That's what product development is all about. I've actually worked in product development before, and that's what we would do. We would look at what competitors were doing and try to mimic it or try to come up with our own recipes.\
\
[00:15:15.290] - Gabby\
So, we would try to come up with our own recipe you know based on what they were doing or something different. We look at all kinds of different industries, not just our industry, but Google can be helpful for that to find a lot of different related products in different industries that you might want to check out. And see if you can get some ideas from your competitors or from other industries. Amazon is a great place to go to as well because they have all of the popular planners listed right here on the front page.\
\
[00:15:50.030] - Gabby\
You can see that this one has 900 reviews.\
\
[00:15:53.330] - Gabby\
So, it's probably if we think that reviews maybe like 10% of people who buy it, 10% to 20% will actually post a review. So, if you times that by more than or 100, that's possibly, you know a lot of people who have bought close to 10,000 people who have bought this planner, if maybe 10% of them left or actually it would be more than that, wouldn't it? If all of these people had bought it. So, you can look at these different products on Amazon and get an idea for what's popular based on the reviews and see what people really like.\
\
[00:16:34.370] - Gabby\
It looks like a lot of people really like the style here. It's just a 2021 planner, but it has a nice cover that's really pretty as well as this one with the flowers.\
\
[00:16:45.110] - Gabby\
So, if you're looking for design ideas, then this might be a good, you know way to go to put some flowers or some kind of marbly-looking texture on the front cover of the plant that you're creating. Another idea is to use PLR, which is private label rights products, also known as Done for you products. So, PLR can come in blog posts, there's courses, there's planners, there's journals, and digital planners, and all kinds of other products that you can use to easily create your own product from. So, another idea to get ideas is to take breaks.\
\
[00:17:23.090] - Gabby\
Like I was telling you that I went to the movies as my break, and that was really helpful for me to get an idea of what I wanted to create for this course. And I wasn't really looking for an idea, but somehow it just landed in my consciousness and I was able to go with it.\
\
[00:17:39.050] - Gabby\
I recognized that it was the connection that I needed for this course, so be sure to take breaks. Stephen King would often take walking breaks, and during his walking break, if he was frustrated with something that he was writing, he usually got the idea that he needed to continue writing whatever he was working on after he took the walking break. So, be sure to take some breaks there's also, you don't have to just walk. You can watch movies, even sleeping can help, doing the dishes, doing the laundry, cleaning your house, all of that stuff helps, or even exercising.\
\
[00:18:15.170] - Gabby\
So just take a break and let things settle so that you will have fresh ideas in your mind. It somehow seems that your mind will just work it out for you if you ask it to most of the time.\
\
[00:18:28.850] - Gabby\
So, let's get into how to channel your ideas into products using a three-step process.\
\
[00:18:36.230] - Gabby\
The first step is to brain dump all of your ideas onto paper. So, as you brain dump all of your ideas, then you'll have a list of ideas you can go back to at any time and create your products from. The second thing is to organize what it is that you brain dumped onto your paper. So, I like to ask three questions. Who is it for?\
\
[00:19:01.370] - Gabby\
Why is it needed? And how will this be different from other similar products? So, as I'm asking that, then I'm able to organize it. Organize the product list that I have into the target markets that I want to hit or the solutions that I want to provide to their problems. So, as I'm doing that, it's better.\
\
[00:19:22.850] - Gabby\
I'm able to organize it easier so that I can come up with you know not do the same thing every time. you know I can come up with a product that's maybe based on health and wellness, when the next product might be based on spiritual growth, and then the next product might be based on business and marketing. That way you space out what it is that you're doing. So, you're not always doing the same thing exactly. Of course, there is steps that your clients might want to take. So, if they take intro to Tarot.\
\
[00:19:55.490] - Gabby\
Maybe they want to take the next step, which is like how to create your own business from your passion. And the third step is to finally take action. You can see this little girl. She looks so happy with the painting that she did and the heart that she drew from the action that she took. But she wouldn't have felt this way if she didn't take any action at all.\
\
[00:20:18.590] - Gabby\
So, make sure to take action on your product idea. It's best to set a deadline, put it in your phone, put it on your schedule right now when you're going to have your product created. Because you will start to want to meet that deadline and move forward on creating your product. Believe me, this works. This helps me so much. If I put a deadline on there, and especially if I have affiliates who are counting on me to produce this product, then I will get it done. Because I know that I have to get it done in order for it to get out there.\
\
[00:20:56.210] - Gabby\
Then the next thing is to decide what you need to get done. So, are you going to create it yourself, or are you going to outsource? How much time do you really have you know, so decide if you have the time to create it yourself, go for it. If you don't, then get help and support along the way.\
\
[00:21:18.350] - Gabby\
You can go on, you know you can hire different parts of the puzzle of the product that you're trying to create. If you're trying to create a course, maybe you want to get PLR to help you with the course content. Or maybe you want to hire a copywriter to help you write part of the course content so that you have that done. And then all you have to do is record the video. Or maybe you need to hire somebody to do the video for you. Or maybe you need to hire somebody to do the graphics and marketing for you.\
\
[00:21:51.830] - Gabby\
You don't have to do everything. You can split it up into bits and pieces that will help to make the product whole if you need to. If you don't have a whole lot of time, the main thing is to really get the product done. So, I had to learn this the hard way. Outsourcing was hard for me.\
\
[00:22:11.930] - Gabby\
I did things all by myself for years, but I wasn't really getting anywhere because I wasn't able to produce on my ideas as much as I wanted to because it was just me you know. And I also had other things I had to do. And so when I learned about outsourcing and I realized, oh, I can pay someone $75 and earn $750, I was a yes to that. I was like, yes, that makes sense to me. I only spend 10% and I earned $750.\
\
[00:22:49.850] - Gabby\
So, it was a yes. So, if you feel like you can pay someone $75 and earn however much it is that you will make from your product. Even if you only make $200, you still got a profit. If you make $750, you've got a great profit if you make even more than that. Let's say that you are really great at marketing and you make $20,000 off of it.\
\
[00:23:16.130] - Gabby\
That was worth it, wasn't it? So make sure that if you need to outsource that you do that and look for the people, then that you need to create it. So, the next thing is to do your thing and create your product, produce it and get it out there, even if it isn't perfect. How many versions of this character? Rosie the Riveter have we seen online?\
\
[00:23:40.730] - Gabby\
There's so many different ones, but yet someone created even another one, and it may not be perfect, but it's still out there. Get your stuff out there, then you will get paid for it as you go for it. And that's what you need to do to create your business and to make money off of your ideas. So just to recap, we talked about using your creativity, which is part of you tapping into that creative side within you, brain dumping your ideas onto paper and getting all of that out of you so that you have a list of products.\
\
[00:24:18.650] - Gabby\
You can probably come up with a list of products that will last you for a year, maybe even five years.\
\
[00:24:24.710] - Gabby\
You never know if you really sit down and you brain dump your products, you could probably come up with at least a list of good ten products to produce and to come up with however many products you're able to generate and to have ideas for, just go with it. Keep writing, keep typing, whatever it is that you're doing to get your product ideas out there, keep doing it. Look on Google, look on Etsy, look on Creative market, if that's right for you, look on Pinterest and get ideas for all of your products. And then put them on the paper so that you have a list of product ideas that you can go to.\
\
[00:25:04.670] - Gabby\
The next thing was to organize your ideas, go with the ones you think that people would really want first. You know you can always pull your audience and see what it is that they want. If you pull them, then they know also that they're expecting a product from you that is related to what they really want. So, if you do that, then you already have a set of people who are looking forward to what you're creating.\
\
[00:25:32.450] - Gabby\
And even if you don't pull your audience, go with what you feel is the right product for you to create right now. You can always start from the beginning of what you think that your audience or your customers need and create that. Then the next thing for our recap is to take action, set that deadline, do it today, set the deadline. If that's the only thing you do today, then do it because your mind will start to be reminding you that you have this deadline that's coming up and you need to reach it.\
\
[00:26:03.830] - Gabby\
So, make sure to take action on your product ideas and then put it out there and I know you've got this.\
\

**Transcript:**\
[00:00:09.450] - Liz Stapleton, Summit Host\
I'm super excited for today's session with Gemma Bonham Carter, hopefully I said that, right? Yeah! Welcome, because we're going to be talking about launching a course, before you create it and selling it before you create it? I think?\
\
[00:00:22.260] - Gemma Bonham Carter, gemmabonhamcarter.com\
Yes.\
\
[00:00:22.440] - Liz\
Which is kind of mind blowing if you really hadn't thought about it that way. I think most people think of creating the course and then trying to sell it. So can you tell us just a little bit about your background, how you came up with this and then we'll get going?\
\
[00:00:39.270] - Gemma\
Yeah, for sure. So I won't I won't bore you with too much background about me. But I do want to mention that I actually got started as a blogger back in 2010.\
\
[00:00:48.450] - Gemma\
That was my first foray into the online space, was writing a home decor blog that I actually still manage to this day called, The Sweetest Digs.\
\
[00:00:59.100] - Liz\
Well, your background looks lovely, so...\
\
[00:00:59.610] - Gemma\
Oh, thanks. \
\
[00:01:05.580] - Gemma\
So I actually still manage that blog, although not as actively as I once did. And in 2016, I made a bit of a shift to doing more business consulting, helping new entrepreneurs get their online businesses going. And I was getting actually initially a lot of questions from other bloggers about what I had done because I'd grown my blog by that point to be like a relatively lucrative business. And so I launched a course and it was for bloggers in the beginning, and I've since launched lots of different programs.\
\
[00:01:44.010] - Gemma\
And that was really a pivotal turning point for me because I didn't really understand at that time the power of online courses and digital programs and products and really that model of doing business. And so for me, the gate swung wide open. I fell deep in love with online courses have since built this business coaching business of mine over at GemmaBonhamCarter.com, where really I do some one to one client work still, like coaching, but the vast majority of my revenue through that business comes from online courses and digital products.\
\
[00:02:22.710] - Gemma\
So that's kind of my background in a nutshell.\
\
[00:02:25.110] - Liz\
OK, got it. So how, if you haven't created the course, how do you sell it? Let's start there, kind of as an overview, we'll dive deeper into kind of the details. But like, how do you sell something that doesn't exist?\
\
[00:02:37.590] - Gemma\
Yeah, so that's it. So let's like, I'll zoom out for a sec, before I'm sure we can get into more specific strategies. But the idea behind what we like to call pre selling is that it's all well and good to think, oK, I'm going to go create a course about this thing that I really love talking about and teaching. But you don't actually know if people are going to be interested in paying to learn about that thing. You might think it's the best idea in the world...\
\
[00:03:11.130] - Gemma\
Your audience might have zero interest, and sometimes it's hard for us to really be in the shoes of our audience and really understand where they're willing to part with dollars. Right. And actually invest in a course or a program. So the idea with pre selling is that before you've gone and recorded videos and made workbooks and invested in an online course platform and all of those things, if you can do really proper validation of your idea in the form of pre selling, you can feel so much more confident about now spending the time in creating that program.\
\
[00:03:11.130] - Gemma\
And so. With market validation, like one of the things that a lot of people seem to do is they think, OK, I'm going to get beta testers and I'm going to get people to beta test my program. And that's all well and fine. And beta testers might give you some great testimonials or something like that or point out some things that you might have...\
\
[00:04:12.520] - Liz\
Gaps that you didn't realize were there.\
\
[00:04:14.140] - Gemma\
Exactly. But it's not true market validation unless somebody is paying money for that product because anyone will be a beta tester, like you're going to give me something for free?\
\
[00:04:24.850] - Liz\
But paid beta testers is a whole different ball game.\
\
[00:04:26.560] - Gemma\
Yeah. But if you can get people paying for that, for that program, then that's really, you're really then able to say, OK, I actually have something here.\
\
[00:04:37.060] - Gemma\
People are actually willing to pay money to learn about this topic. So let me go further and actually create this program. And so with pre selling, you're going to, you're going to have crafted what I like to call an offer prototype. So you have your course offer all mapped out. You know exactly what each module and lesson would look like. You know, the workbooks that are going with it. You know, what bonuses would be included, how you're going to deliver it.\
\
[00:05:00.040] - Gemma\
All of that is mapped out ahead of time. But then you're, you're not going and creating it. You've crafted that offer, and then you're going to put it out to your audience and say, OK, here's what this is going to look like. Here's the sort of you want to be realistic about the schedule. Like this is going to be a course that's dripped over eight weeks so that you can stay on top of delivering the content in a way that's going to work for you.\
\
[00:05:24.010] - Gemma\
And you can kind of maybe be a week or two ahead so that you're not feeling too stressed and and launch it and do a launch and get people to, you know, get your, whether that's like social media, via email marketing, using webinars, like whatever it might be, and have a sales page and get people to purchase. Knowing that the course starts on October 1st, November 1st, January 1st, whenever that start date is, and you actually run through it with the first time with those founding students, almost like in a live way, like you can prerecord all the stuff and drip it out.\
\
[00:05:58.430] - Gemma\
But it's kind of like....\
\
[00:05:59.560] - Liz\
You can answer questions.\
\
[00:06:00.880] - Gemma\
Exactly.\
\
[00:06:01.810] - Gemma\
And that's really like the zoomed out version of why you want to presell, because how good is it going to feel to get 10, 20, 30 students to pay you to create that program that you kind of have an idea around? And then when you've come to the end of creation, you've gone through it with your first group of founding students. You've got some great testimonials there. Now you can package it up, launch it again, rinse and repeat your launch and just keep making sales over and over and over without having to go and create new lessons or new workbooks or whatever.\
\
[00:06:33.820] - Liz\
And you might add a bonus here and there. Sure. But...\
\
[00:06:36.130] - Gemma\
Exactly.\
\
[00:06:37.150] - Liz\
So from a timeline standpoint, how far from sort of the end of your launch or cart close would you recommend the start date be?\
\
[00:06:46.630] - Gemma\
Probably, I would say. You know, give yourself a solid week or two to recover from your launch before starting, and I wouldn't go any longer than three to four weeks out, like I can't really see people wanting....\
\
[00:07:02.400] - Liz\
They aren't going to be as pumped up a month later.\
\
[00:07:04.740] - Gemma\
Yeah, if you leave it too long, you're just losing that momentum. I also get worried that you might have some people maybe asking for a refund because you've kind of left it too long and they're second guessing the investment.\
\
[00:07:17.010] - Liz\
So it might be like during your launch, once you get the first few sales, start working on less than one so that you can get a little bit ahead.\
\
[00:07:23.550] - Gemma\
Totally.\
\
[00:07:24.390] - Liz\
OK, got it.\
\
[00:07:26.250] - Gemma\
And actually, I should say, because I get this question a lot, people say, "well, what happens if I only sell like two spots? Do I have to then carry it out and deliver on it? If I really didn't get the numbers I was hoping for?" And there's a couple of things to think about before we make a decision. One thing is like, well, how big is your audience? Like if you have an audience that's five thousand ten thousand people and you made two sales.\
\
[00:07:52.710] - Gemma\
Yeah. That conversion rate's bad, we're not going to go ahead and like, see this through because it's just the idea hasn't been proven well enough.\
\
[00:08:01.110] - Gemma\
But if you have an audience of like 20 people on your email list and you got two sales, that's actually a really decent conversion rate and you should probably run with that and then also concentrate on growing your audience and growing your email list. Right. And maybe do them in tandem. So to if it was option A, where you have a big audience and you only made a couple of sales, honestly, it's not that big of a deal to just give people a refund and just say, thank you so much for purchasing. I really appreciate it. Unfortunately, we didn't get the volume we were expecting for this round. So we are going to go ahead and give you a full refund." You can be extra nice and be like, here's a, here's like an extra downloadable that we have that we just wanted to send your way as a thank you, you know, just like kill them with kindness and nobody's going to care. Like you're the only one who feels any kind of way about that.\
\
[00:08:52.980] - Gemma\
They're going to be like, oh, OK. Well,\
\
[00:08:54.900] - Liz\
Yeah, I think the sort of the impression you leave with them is you're open and honest and you take care of your, your customers and your people. So when down the road they're going to feel good purchasing with you again.\
\
[00:09:04.350] - Gemma\
Exactly.\
\
[00:09:05.700] - Liz\
Yeah. OK, so that actually was one of my questions. So thank you for answering it. OK, so I know you said you have specific strategies. You suggest when when launching, a pre selling a course. Do you want to dive into those?\
\
[00:09:25.080] - Gemma\
Sure, yeah. So I have a couple, three main ones that I usually talk to my students about. The first one is a little different.\
\
[00:09:35.580] - Gemma\
So the first one is actually using a paid live workshop.\
\
[00:09:40.290] - Gemma\
And the reason why we do this is it's almost like we are testing the waters on whether people are interested in learning about a given topic. And we're doing it in a much smaller scale with a live workshop that's actually paid. So let's say you want to create I'll give you an example. Actually, I worked with a client. She is also in kind of the the entrepreneurship space. And she's really an expert at Instagram, social media, and sort of sales.\
\
[00:10:10.050] - Gemma\
So but she thought, OK, well, I don't I've never had a course before. I don't know if people are actually interested in learning from me about this. And I said, well, why don't we test the waters with three different paid live workshops? And so you can offer it on three different topics, all within the her general niche, get a sense of what are people willing to like? Maybe there is going to be one that's like really well attended and that's going to give you a clue as to what your course should be about.\
\
[00:10:38.220] - Gemma\
Maybe none of them will be well attended at all. And we'll need to go back to the drawing board and rework this and figure out actually what your audience wants to buy from you. And so she came up with three different topics. She put them out there.\
\
[00:10:52.260] - Gemma\
She got a giant response, made thousands and thousands of dollars actually just from these workshops. And then was, that gave her real validation to then say, OK, now I am going to go ahead and put this course together and launch it. And she did and had huge success with that, too. So a paid live workshop is something that not a lot of entrepreneurs use and I think is a really, really great strategy. So that's strategy number one.\
\
[00:11:16.770] - Gemma\
Strategy number two is your typical webinar. And maybe you're sitting there and you're like, oh, I hate webinars, but I'm going to just tell you, webinars are still working. And they work, like they really work. And I think there is so much value in a webinar for a few reasons because it does so many things in one kind of 60 minute container, it can build relationship and trust with the people who are watching. You can have, create incredible rapport on a webinar in that time and share a bit of your own story and build your own expert status and credibility.\
\
[00:11:54.450] - Gemma\
You can teach them stuff and so that they're like really learning from you. And they are going to walk away from that webinar, having really learned something, have some aha moments, that kind of thing, and get a sense of OK, like she's actually pretty good at teaching about this and I really liked learning from her. And ultimately you can pitch your product and really tell people exactly what it is. And in the case of a presale, you're telling them this is a founding student launch, you're going to get in at the best price it'll ever be.\
\
[00:12:22.590] - Gemma\
We're offering it for 50 percent off for our first students who enroll and tell them exactly what's going to be included, how it's going to roll out all of that kind of stuff so you can do all of those things in that 60 minute container of a webinar. And even if people don't purchase on the webinar, you've grown your email list. You really have continued to build your your credibility in your niche. And they just it does all kinds of good things for you and your, your audience.\
\
[00:12:48.960] - Gemma\
So I love webinars. I don't think they're going anywhere anytime soon. Just maybe don't don't be like slimey in your webinar is all I can say. Right.\
\
[00:13:00.270] - Liz\
And be authentic. Be honest. If you're nervous, be like I'm a little nervous. I've never done this, you know, like, that's fine.\
\
[00:13:06.570] - Gemma\
Yes. The more authentic and vulnerable you can be, crack jokes that you think are funny, like whatever, do like, really let your personality shine through. If you can do all that, you're really going to get the right kind of students in your program. So a webinar is something that I really try to encourage all of my clients and students to do. They're always nervous to do their first one. It always goes better than they think it's going to go.\
\
[00:13:31.920] - Gemma\
And they're always actually like, so shocked when they get their first sales running in from that webinar. So that's the second strategy. And then the third strategy. We're getting really simple here. It's like one to one conversations. And so if you put out. Whether it is a Facebook live video or an Instagram story or an email to your email list and you say basically, listen, I'm creating this program, it's going to be about this. It's going to solve this problem for you.\
\
[00:14:06.030] - Gemma\
We're going to start running it on January 1st, if you're interested, book a sales call, like book a call, a discovery call, whatever you want to call it.\
\
[00:14:15.930] - Gemma\
Either either. Actually, if you don't even want to do a call thing, you can say you can at least get them to respond to the email or get into your direct messages and have a conversation that way about it. I'm in my direct messages a lot doing like voice notes with people. I often just respond that way and then we can have a conversation. I can answer any questions they might have about my program. And then there's so much more trusting and ready to hop in because they've had that interaction with me.\
\
[00:14:40.650] - Gemma\
They know I'm a real person, I'm not a scam artist, and they're now excited to work with me. But really, it's just those one to one conversations. And the nice thing about booking the call of that 15 minute or 30 minute call is whether it's a call or the D.M. You just really need to do more listening than talking. And you really need to understand, is that person, like what are their goals? What are they struggling with?\
\
[00:15:06.990] - Gemma\
Where do they ultimately want to end up?\
\
[00:15:09.270] - Gemma\
And if your program is going to be the right fit for them, then you make the offer and just say give the scoop of what it's all about. You don't need to be super pressure-y or salesy. If they feel like it's the right fit, they're going to hop in.\
\
[00:15:21.940] - Liz\
Yeah, and you can always be like, you know, I don't think this is the right fit for you.\
\
[00:15:25.250] - Gemma\
Absolutely.\
\
[00:15:26.100] - Liz\
Check this out of mine or something.\
\
[00:15:28.290] - Gemma\
Yes.\
\
[00:15:29.550] - Liz\
From having a background in sales, the more the "prospect", if you want to use sales lingo is talking, the better off you are. You want to ask open ended questions, really hear their struggles and listen and respond. If you're spending all the time talking it's not going well.\
\
[00:15:44.340] - Gemma\
Exactly. And you can actually. So those three strategies we talked about were a paid leave workshop, a webinar and one to one conversations. You can combine those, right. Like you could do a webinar and also have one to one conversations. Have both avenues open during your launch to ultimately fill your program for that first round.\
\
[00:16:04.500] - Liz\
Yes. So I love those ideas. I think you're right, I don't see a lot of paid live workshops. Webinars have been around and one on one. But so I have a question because all those are great.\
\
[00:16:17.730] - Liz\
And the idea of preselling is you're not investing a ton of time and work into something that doesn't work out?\
\
[00:16:22.230] - Gemma\
Correct.\
\
[00:16:22.770] - Liz\
But chances are you need to invest in some tools to make any of these launches possible. So would you say is worth investing in a pre sale launch?\
\
[00:16:33.810] - Gemma\
So in terms of tools like, OK, so you need a sales page, which means you need to build out a landing page on some software.\
\
[00:16:42.660] - Gemma\
So whether that is WordPress, Squarespace Wix show it.\
\
[00:16:46.800] - Gemma\
But actually you can even just do it on Canva. Like Canva allows you to publish now to a website so you can actually create a free website on Canva so you can have a sales page. That way, if you don't have a checkout software, you can do a PayPal buy button like you can just if you have a PayPal account, you can create a button that says buy here and put the amount of dollars on it and it just goes through PayPal so we can get really simple with that too.\
\
[00:17:13.920] - Gemma\
You, if you want to host a webinar, yes, you do need like some sort of casting software. I use something called webinar jam, which does it does cost several hundred dollars a year for that. But you could use a platform like Zoom, you could use a platform like Google meet. If you want to get really basic, you could just live stream on Facebook.\
\
[00:17:36.030] - Liz\
Yeah. I've heard that. Yeah.\
\
[00:17:37.530] - Gemma\
Right. So there's I think, whenever we talk about tech.\
\
[00:17:42.510] - Liz\
Livestream YouTube too, same idea.\
\
[00:17:44.160] - Gemma\
Yeah, exactly. So whenever we talk about tech I find there's like a spectrum of like scrappy and pro and like you can go wherever you want on that spectrum.\
\
[00:17:53.300] - Liz\
If this is your first launch and you have no budget go scrappy.\
\
[00:17:56.640] - Gemma\
Exactly. And like emails, your probably, you're going to need an email marketing platform.\
\
[00:18:00.990] - Gemma\
Again, a lot of those email marketing platforms for the first thousand subscribers are free, like Mailer Lite.\
\
[00:18:07.590] - Gemma\
MailChimp, I'm pretty sure Convertkit has a free plan now so you can get going without having invested much money. And I really think that there is an ability to be scrappy here. And in my opinion is that bloggers tend to be some of the scrappiest around. And can really make it work without getting the most bells and whistles software out there. So it's possible and it actually takes, I think, less than what we anticipate it will.\
\
[00:18:39.810] - Liz\
Yeah.\
\
[00:18:40.080] - Gemma\
And from it actually from a delivery point of view of a course, you're right. Like once you get people enrolled, you are going to have to deliver the program, but again, if we don't want to invest in any online core software, you could theoretically just have a Facebook group for your community aspect of it and then create content on a Google drive and share it that way or in a Dropbox.\
\
[00:19:03.870] - Liz\
I think the blogging course I took was completely by email. Like eventually, they like did like a full video stuff.\
\
[00:19:10.100] - Liz\
It was like her first launch in this in the niche after. And I was like, and that course is still for way more than I have access to everything, which is great. But...\
\
[00:19:18.650] - Gemma\
Exactly.\
\
[00:19:19.730] - Liz\
It was these like 20 page emails and I would print them out and I would go through like 2014, 2015 or something.\
\
[00:19:26.360] - Gemma\
Yeah.\
\
[00:19:26.960] - Liz\
And yeah. Yeah. So you can always start there too.\
\
[00:19:30.680] - Gemma\
You can always start there.\
\
[00:19:31.760] - Liz\
Setting the expectation. So have an idea probably of how you're going to deliver so that you can set the expectation for them of what they can, you know how they're going to receive it.\
\
[00:19:40.350] - Liz\
Exactly. But yeah it's like that, I just love that story. And you know a) that was like her being scrappy b) you didn't mind at all receiving it that way, like you still feel, like you still got value out of the course. And C) you've just proven my point about how valuable being a founding student is, because you get it for the best price and then you're always grandfathered in and get all the stuff as it evolves.\
\
[00:20:08.480] - Liz\
Yeah, it's like a $1000 course now or something I got for like a hundred fifty bucks.\
\
[00:20:12.080] - Gemma\
Exactly. And so if you as the person who is like launching their first course can make sure that people realize like that's part of the messaging and the marketing when we're doing a founding launch is to really say like you're going to get this at the best rate ever and get lifetime access and grandfathered into any future updates that come with this program. And that can really incentivize. I love being a founding student. Any time anybody launches something who, like, is somebody that I trust and it's something I want to learn about, you better believe I'm hopping in as the founding student.\
\
[00:20:46.160] - Liz\
Yeah, yeah. I mean, so it was, I mean, it was my first blogging course. It seemed like a huge investment at the time, wasn't making any money on my blog. And it was I mean it completely turned. I now have been self employed online for years and never would have happened if I hadn't started with that first course. So recognize the impact you can have on your students lives too.\
\
[00:21:07.070] - Gemma\
Absolutely\
\
[00:21:07.140] - Liz\
Because sometimes you just worry that they're not going to like it, but you don't realize how much you can help.\
\
[00:21:12.900] - Liz\
I was like, OK, so my next question is because you haven't created how do you decide on the pricing, whether it's for the live workshop or for the presell? \
\
[00:21:22.850] - Gemma\
A really good question. And it's a tricky one because it's unfortunately not one of those things where I can give a formula, you know, like there isn't a cut and dry formula that I can give you where you can plug in some numbers and come out with your perfect price.\
\
[00:21:36.950] - Gemma\
That is going to just like always hit it on the nail every time. So it is a bit of an art and a science. I will say it. The three niches that typically we see can charge probably the higher price tags are if you are in the niches of health, wealth and relationships, those tend to be if you think about, like an online course or a workshop or really any kind of digital product, it's solving a problem for somebody.\
\
[00:22:07.280] - Gemma\
It is. It is the solution to a pain point. And how deep that pain point is felt is correlated with how much they will spend to fix that pain point, to fix that problem. And so if I am a brand new real estate agent and I need to learn how to land clients using social media because cold calling and door knocking isn't what we do these days. And I don't know how to land clients. And my livelihood depends on me landing clients.\
\
[00:22:41.240] - Gemma\
You better believe I'm going to be ready to invest a thousand bucks in a program that's going to teach me how to do that, because I know a) it's a really deep pain point for me and b) the return on my investment is going to be really good. As another example, if I'm somebody who is, I don't know, I'm home schooling my kids right now and I want to do art lessons with them on a weekly basis, I, that's a pain point that I want to solve.\
\
[00:23:12.820] - Gemma\
I want to have some...\
\
[00:23:13.620] - Liz\
Don't want to be on Pinterest every single week.\
\
[00:23:14.860] - Gemma\
That's right. I want to have some kind of like created easy to deliver and manage art lessons for my kids once a week. I'm willing to spend some money to solve that pain point. However, I'm not going to be spending a thousand dollars because it's not as deeply felt as health, wealth or relationship type pain points would feel. I'm also not necessarily, I'm getting a return in terms of I'm getting a return on my time because I don't want to waste my time looking for this and my frustration.\
\
[00:23:48.280] - Gemma\
But I'm not necessarily getting a return in terms of money. I'm not necessarily making more money or saving more money. So that would play into the pricing of that particular program. So you would want that one to be like that water, lets say it's watercolor painting or whatever art it is for kids, like it would need to be a bit lower. I'm probably not going to spend a thousand bucks. Right. This is going to need to be a much lower price point.\
\
[00:24:10.030] - Gemma\
And so you kind of need to look at your own program, figure out, OK, what is the problem that I'm ultimately solving with this? How deeply felt is that pain point? Is my customer able to make money or save money by taking my program? If not, like, what are the other things? Are they saving time, frustration, all of those types of things? And then you're just going to need to do some testing in the marketplace.\
\
[00:24:37.270] - Gemma\
And typically with that first launch, it's going to be the cheapest it's ever going to be. So don't freak out about, you know that you can't ever put it up.\
\
[00:24:47.320] - Gemma\
You know, if you have an idea that eventually you want this course to be 197 or 297 or five hundred dollars or whatever, you can start halfway to that point and know that you can increase it over time. You're not set in stone.\
\
[00:25:02.440] - Liz\
Yeah. So do you kind of apply that same logic when determining the pricing for the paid live launch, or paid live workshop or is that kind of, is there a sort of range that those fall into?\
\
[00:25:13.300] - Gemma\
Yeah, no, it's definitely the same.\
\
[00:25:15.770] - Gemma\
You ask yourself the same questions, you know, similarly, like if you were delivering a workshop for real estate agents, you can imagine like a two hour live workshop where they also get to walk away with some, I don't know, templates or swipe files or things like that. Like you could be charging at least several hundred dollars for that. If I'm doing a two hour watercolor workshop about how to paint peonies, I'm probably going to be charging forty seven bucks.\
\
[00:25:45.140] - Liz\
Yeah.\
\
[00:25:45.450] - Gemma\
Right? Like, it's just it's not going to be in the same arena for the, all of those same reasons. And typically with workshops, I like it to be anywhere from like I probably wouldn't go any lower than something like a $37, $47 as my absolute base level for something like a two hour workshop. And when I say workshops I always like to there's extras that come with it too like things that they can take home with them or download or whatever all the way up to.\
\
[00:26:14.920] - Gemma\
Yeah. Hundreds of dollars for that, for that live workshop.\
\
[00:26:18.880] - Liz\
OK, I know we're starting to run out of time. So let me just so let's kind of talk about, make sure, I think we've mostly answered my questions. This can really be done for any course level, whether it's $27. $47. $997.\
\
[00:26:35.530] - Gemma\
Yeah.\
\
[00:26:37.120] - Liz\
And we talked about testing to figure out the subject. So step by step is, is come up with an idea, figure out how you're going to test, whether it's going to be with a paid live workshop or webinar or just one on one conversations with your email list, surveys.\
\
[00:26:54.160] - Liz\
However you want to do that, figure out which one is really speaking to people and then work on prepping a launch, which means sales page, simple check out. You can be scrappy, mechanics. I'm like took notes. So I'm like... be scrappy. Sell it. But a launch is going to be launch emails too, you need to focus on that. You need some, some graphics, some mockups probably social media, Canva is great for that Canva can be like you said, your sales page.\
\
[00:27:21.490] - Liz\
I may use it for that. I'm learning a lot about Canva this year with various Summit sessions I'm doing. I was like, oh, I didn't know it could do that.\
\
[00:27:28.570] - Gemma\
Oh my gosh. Canava is like my\
\
[00:27:31.300] - Liz\
Yeah, I have a love hate relationship with Canva there's a lot of things I love about it and a lot of things I'm like ugh.\
\
[00:27:34.540] - Gemma\
I'm all love.\
\
[00:27:40.210] - Liz\
But I stopped using them for like a year and then I was like, oh well I can do that now.\
\
[00:27:44.680] - Gemma\
Yeah, they added a lot of features.\
\
[00:27:47.060] - Liz\
Yeah. Anyway, back to prepping. Do the launch once you've got a good number of sales, it looks like the conversion rate is meeting your expectations. Start working on that first lesson to deliver a couple weeks after your cart close, kind of go from there? Is that kind of step by step what we said to presell your course?\
\
[00:28:07.840] - Gemma\
You totally nailed it.\
\
[00:28:09.760] - Liz\
Is there anything I missed that they would need for their launch? Besides, I mean,\
\
[00:28:13.950] - Gemma\
A launch can look a lot of different ways. When I work with my students, I kind of layout a smorgasbord of like, these are all the things that you can do in a launch. And I think it's best to pick and choose the things that feel right for you and resonate with how you want to show up. I'm not going to tell you to go and do a live series in a free Facebook group if that's not what resonates with you.\
\
[00:28:38.110] - Gemma\
Right. Like maybe you're much better at just sticking with email writing and Instagram or something like that. So we talk about different different things that can take place during your launch. But ultimately the big goal is get really visible, talk to your audience and drive people to the sales page is like those are the big goals.\
\
[00:28:58.210] - Liz\
All right. Awesome. Thank you so much, Gemma. I really appreciate you being part of the Summit. I know you have something for attendees. Do you want to tell them about it. And the link is below, I think, to the right, if I remember correctly.\
\
[00:29:10.510] - Gemma\
Yeah. So if if you want to learn more about how to effectively create a course that sells, I do have a free 60 minute master class that is, you can sign up for and watch it on your own time and you can head on over to gemmabonhamcarter.com/course-class . I go more into pre selling. We talk about like what makes a really irresistible online course offer and all sorts of other nitty gritty behind the scenes strategies that I like to share.\
\
[00:29:39.880] - Gemma\
And I tell you a little bit more about my story, too, so you can head on over to that link to sign up for that free class. And actually, I should also mention, because we talked about the paid live workshops, I have a brand new actually product at gemmabonhamcarter.com/workshop-wins that talks a lot more about how to effectively create those paid live workshops and use them as either a test for your bigger online course or just a strategy to layer in some additional revenue into your business.\
\
[00:30:13.090] - Gemma\
So that's I'm really excited about that one, too.\
\
[00:30:15.580] - Liz\
Yeah, that sounds like I'm going to check that out, guys. Definitely go check those links out. And again, thank you so much for joining us. I hope you have a great, wonderful rest of your day.\
\
[00:30:26.050] - Gemma\
Yeah. Thank you so much for having me it was a pleasure.\

Liz Stapleton [00:00:00]:\
Alright, guys. I'm excited for this session with Hannah from hannahljohnson.com. Hannah, welcome. Thank you so much for doing this.\
\
Hannah Johnson [00:00:05]:\
Thank you so much for having me. I'm excited to be here.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:00:08]:\
Yeah. Because you're gonna be talking about how to use Pinterest, not just I mean, I think everyone thinks of Pinterest for, like, getting their blog content there. And, yes, it's great for that, but it's it's great for marketing period and including marketing ways that make you money directly, not just like they go to your blog post and they maybe find something. You know? so can you tell us a little bit about your background and what what we're gonna learn?\
\
Hannah Johnson [00:00:32]:\
Yeah. Of course. So I am a blog and Pinterest specialist. They pair together really well, but what a lot of people don't under end is once you start making money with your blog, it becomes a business. So those of you that are like, oh, I don't really know if I wanna create a business you're going to want to because that's when the money comes in. And I, kind of stumbled upon my Pinterest strategy that I have been kind of perfecting for the last couple of years, and I ended up making just three pins to sell a digital ebook that I created and that made me $3000 in 3 months. And I just created those 3 pins pinned them, and they went viral, and it was crazy. And from then, I've kind of specialized in getting really specific with that and selling that digital content and also affiliate links and doing that whole thing with blogging on Pinterest because it's basically on autopilot, and it's Awesome. Consistent passive income is what we're going for, and that is that's what I specialize in. That's what they do.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:01:34]:\
Yes. So, I'm excited to dig in for you to teach us how we can sort of accomplish similar results. So I'm gonna let you go ahead and take over let's let's go.\
\
Hannah Johnson [00:01:33]:\
Passive income with Pinterest on autopilot. Today, I'm gonna be talking with you about how you can drive tons of traffic, tons of income into your pockets with digital products on Pinterest. Before we get into the talk, I'd love for you to connect with me on Instagram. Tag me on Instagram stories. Tell me why you are here watching this talk If you have an idea for a digital product, share that with me. I'd love to hear what you're creating, what you wanna create, and why you wanna create it. So what you can expect from this talk today is learning the different types of income, what from blogging that you can that you can make from blogging, the power of Pinterest, why we're going to be focusing on digital products and not the other forms of income, and then also I'm gonna be teaching you my 4 pillars to selling success on Pinterest. So passive income with blogging, there's 4 main ways I have not found any other way to really make passive income with blogging, other than these 4, but digital products is my number one and the way that I love to make money ads is the second, and I would say probably the most popular way to make money, affiliate marketing, probably second most popular way. and then the brand end, the brand collaboration slash deals. Typically, when people come into the blogging community, they are looking to make money with ads affiliate marketing, brand collaborations, digital products, or something that's a little more scary because it, it involves you creating something that you're going to sell. And selling really kind of makes people turn away and get a little nervous because they feel like they're being sleazy selling and and all that stuff, but I really want to make it clear that you are selling to these people, especially with Pinterest, Pinterest allows you to reach your ideal audience and sell to them and and give them access to your product and they purchase without even speaking to you. So they know that your product is not only good enough, but also going to help them, which is why they're going to invest money into it. You're not messaging people, you're not in an MLM. This is something that you are doing on autopilot because you've created such an irresistible offer. A little bit of the power of Pinterest, the life of a Pinterest pin is 1600 times longer than that of an Instagram or a Facebook post. Now, just by being on Pinterest and sharing a pin, you already will be able to reach an audience that is larger than you could on Instagram with a post or a story on there. These are a couple of demograph demographic type statistics. There are over\
\
Hannah Johnson [00:04:43]:\
300,000,000 active Pinterest users, and that number is growing every single day.\
\
Hannah Johnson [00:04:49]:\
70% of those users are female, and 40% of the new user sign ups are male. So even though this platform is primarily female, men are getting on board with Pinterest and and starting to use it a little more. Millennials use Pinterest as much as they use Instagram. And this is kind of a metric that shocks a lot of people especially in the kind of digital world because although Pinterest is not a social media form, it's definitely thrown in there more than what it should be. and not only that, but because Instagram is so big, people don't even think about Pinterest in terms of marketing efforts. So it's really, really important to understand that millennials are using Pinterest just as much as they're using Instagram. And a couple metrics in terms of, money 50% of Pinterest users earn $50,000 or greater per year, and that's per user. That's a user, 50 percent of the overall users. So 50 percent of the 300,000,000 active users are earning quite a bit of money per year. And not only that, but 40% of pinners have a household income of over a $100,000 a year.\
\
Hannah Johnson [00:06:09]:\
10% of Pinterest households making greater than a\
\
Hannah Johnson [00:06:11]:\
$125,000 a year compared to the US average household income of $63,000 a year. These net these next two metrics are by far my favorite, They really, really show not only the power of Pinterest, in general, but also the power that Pinterest has in terms of selling. selling, it doesn't matter if it's a digital or physical in this sense. I will explain why we're gonna talk about digital products, in a moment, but\
\
Hannah Johnson [00:06:43]:\
64% of Pinterest users described the platform as a place to find ideas products or services that they can trust, meaning, this is the platform that they use 64% of those users use this place. So over 50% as a way to find products and services that they wanna use. And then this next metric is by far my favorite.\
\
Hannah Johnson [00:07:18]:\
84% of Pinner's use Pinterest to decide what to buy. And basically what that means is there is no reason why you should not be creating something to sell on this platform? Because they're coming people are coming to Pinterest to purchase and making decisions, making purchasing decisions on the platform already, so why not give them a reason to purchase from you? So now I'm gonna tell you why we wanna focus on digital products. Now think about this really quickly before even reading what I have on the screen. If you are somebody, which I'm assuming you've used Pinterest before, since you are at a blogging summit, you Start a blog and you are looking for tips. You try Google. You're looking on Pinterest and all of a sudden you come across a a page. And on this page, they have an ebook for sale. The ebook is $9 and they're telling you that they will give you step by step instructions on how to start your blog for just $9. If you're somebody trying to start a blog, that's gonna seem very appealing to you. But there's also a lot of free information out there about how to start a blog. So maybe you're probably thinking, I don't know if I really wanna invest the $9, but then you scroll down a little more and you see the first the first chapter of the book is free. So not only are you able to see what the first step of creating a successful blog is, and how to get started, but they're literally giving you the rest of the information for just $9. Now if you're someone who didn't really have a lot of time or doesn't really want to spend a lot of time searching, then you may wanna be investing in this product. That's kind of a scenario that a lot of people go through. And not only that, but the the bet the main reason why I really love digital products is because you feed into the customer or the reader or the purchaser's excitement They're excited about starting a blog. They're excited about learning how to sew or getting, more growth on Instagram or whatever it is. when you give them access to a product that's going to save them time or teach them everything that they need to know, They are going to be so enticed to purchase because they get it immediately. They don't have to wait for Amazon to deliver it or wait a week for them to get it in the mail. Not only that, but that free chapter that I mentioned before allows them to get a taste of what they have or what they're going to get before they buy. We'll get into more of this later in the 4 pillars of, selling success, but tip number one of selling is always give free content. I feel like that's probably known pretty well in this in the whole selling aspect things, but anyway, the last reason why I really like digital products because they give you a one end done approach. You are able to create a product one time, and you're done. There's no stock that you have to keep. You don't have to keep create recreating the product. You just have to update it when you want to, or if you're selling templates or something like that, you don't even have to update it. They just purchased one time and they're done. So let me talk about the 4 pillars to selling success on Pinterest in 2020. The 4 pillars are market research, landing and sales page design, supporting content, and your Pinterest strategy. The reason why I specifically picked these 4 pillars is because these are what I have found in my 5 years of working with blogging and Pinterest to be the most important. Let me dive in. Market research is by far the most important pillar. If you can't get market research down, then you definitely need to reevaluate because a 100% of time, your audience will tell you what they want. Always, always ask And if you don't have an audience, you can start with something small like an ebook to build up your audience. However, you should always look at what other players in your industry are doing. What are what have they been successful with? What are they doing that they could be doing better? What are they not doing that they should be doing? Those are all notes that you should be jotting down and paying attention to. because that's what's going to set you apart. Now if you are somebody, for example, who is wanting to teach somebody how to fly fish, Maybe you go on Pinterest, do some keyword research, and figure out what your specific audience is looking for in terms of live fishing. Do they wanna learn everything? Are they only specifically trying to figure out the best ways to cast? I'm not a fly fishing expert. That's just the example that popped into my head. but think about and try and do as much research as you can because that market research aspect of it will be the key to success for you. If you can create an audience if you can create a product that your audience is dying for, that they can't live without that will save them time, that will save them money, and overall will save them from failing, then you have just created your ticket to success. These precise and smart about your product creation do not just create a product that you think your audience will want. That is the biggest mistake that I see so many bloggers and online entrepreneurs make. they just create something that they think their audience will want. You are an expert in selling, and you think that your audience wants to know everything about selling, when in reality, they only wanna learn one thing. Start there first. Okay. Landing page design. You can create an amazing product all day long, but if your landing page or your sales page does not speak to your audience, then you're not gonna make any sales. And the reason why I didn't like, have a pillar in the 4 pillars to selling success on copywriting is because, yeah, copywriting is super important if you are selling a very high ticket item. However, if you're starting small with video trainings and templates and courses, or ebooks? It's not as important if you have the other things in place. So my number one tip going back to the one that I already gave you is always offer something free. The first chapter, a virtual tour, the first module, something to get your audience to trust and understand that you know what you're talking about. No matter what price is, it's an investment to them. So you wanna show them exactly what you are going to give them. Stopping really quickly right here just to do a side note. When I created my first digital product, It was everything you need to know about Instagram and becoming an Instagram influencer, growing your audience, and working with brands. with 3 pins, I made $3000 because I created a gallery on the sales page, or I call it a landing page because I wasn't it wasn't a traditional sales page. And I created a gallery that gave away the first twelve pages of the book. It had the title the table of contents, the welcome page, and the first whole chapter. Now, here's the tip. Again, you're not trying to give away your secrets in this free content. but you're trying to give them a little bit. So, for example, my first chapter was about the Instagram algorithm, describing what it was, all of the different metrics, everything we knew and could be researched on for the algorithm. That was stuff that was already that could already be found on the internet. However, I added my thoughts and my strategies on how we can take the information that we know from the Instagram algorithm and make it work for us instead of fighting it. So not only was I giving the audience a convenient way to view all of the information on the algorithm, but I was also giving them a little bit of information for free about how to use the algorithm to work for you. And then also, I was kind of showing them how I write. I have been a blogger long enough that I understand that my audience loves the way I write because I write like I talk. That's just something that they like. I have had so many people come to me and say, I can't believe how much information you gave away on your landing page. That was amazing. I purchased just because of that. And then I've also had other people come to me and say that they purchased just because they liked the way that I talked. They liked the way that I described things. I described things in a way that was easy to understand. Those are all little tiny consumer things that you may not remember or put into, effect when you're creating this product. So make sure to really get into the mind of your audience in the, in, in the mind of your customer when you're creating the sales page, the landing page, and the product in general. So many times I see people creating landing pages for their products and not adding the price You want to be upfront about your price with your audience. You want to make sure that they know exactly what it is upfront, honestly, and authentically. Don't try to hide it. Don't get them to click on the the checkout page so they can see the the price. Just give it to them upfront. and make sure that they know exactly what the investment is upfront and center. Now supporting content This I have to say is the 2nd biggest pillar because if you were someone who tried to sell a digital product before and completely flopped? I'm assuming this is what you did. You created a landing page, you created the product, you wrote a blog post about it and you shared it on social media, but you got nothing but crickets. That's because you did it wrong. You didn't create any supporting content. You created one social media post and a blog post. You shared it around one time and you expected people to purchase. or maybe you shared it 5 or 10 times and still nobody purchased. The reason why is because you need to be creating supporting blog posts, not just one multiple. Inside of pinning profit, which is my, newly launched program, I teach my easy content creation method, and that helps you create profitable content, know how much of that content to create, when to create it, and when to share it. But just as a little introduction to that, If you have one digital product, you should be writing a minimum of 5 supporting blog posts about it. And then each of those blog posts should have 10 pins created for it for them. So a total of 50 pins for those blog posts and 5 social media posts and stories created as well in addition. That way, you can not only share content over the course of a couple months, but you're not pressed for time creating the content. You have this content already available in your queue. You can be organized and know exactly when you should share it and how you should share it. I get sales through Instagram consistently because of this strategy. because I'm creating supporting content, and I'll get more into this in the Pinterest strategy in just a moment, but people need to see something multiple times before they purchase And if you're just pitching them constantly and constantly, they're not gonna purchase. They want the supporting content, so they know you know what you're talking about. It's just like the landing page strategy, but overall in these blog posts, you're going to be sending them to the landing page. So you, for example, let me give you this little, like, preview. You I created my Instagram ebook. So maybe the blog post that I the supporting blog posts that I create are how to grow your Instagram following, then I add 10 tips in there, just 10, or how to get started with brands on Instagram, and I have a couple tips in there. it's that, it's that little bit of content that you're just expanding on the topic and then saying, Hey, if you want more, here's this awesome, like, $10 ebook or $20 ebook that I created, that's gonna tell you everything you need to know about X Y Z. Or if you're going with a more specific topic then you can still say this is everything that you need to know about how to cast as a fly fisherman. I mean, going back to that horrible example, that is something that you can do. Now, with your Pinterest Strategy, fresh new content is the key to success, and this is where that supporting content comes in even better. Now, obviously, there's a lot more to a Pinterest strategy than just creating content, how many pins you're pinning a day, what your pins look like. There's a whole science to pin design, but just to give you a little bit of information and not completely overwhelm you with everything Pinterest related, new content and fresh content, and supporting content is the key on Pinterest. when I was selling my ebook, I got lucky and I had pins that were going to my landing page go viral, and they're actually still going viral almost a year later. However, it's not always that easy. I work with Pinterest clients every single day who are trying to sell digital products, and it's very difficult to get their landing pages to go viral if they've just started an account or if they're transitioning their audience. It's very easy to get lucky if you have the pin science down and all of that stuff, but there are other key factors that play into your pins going viral. But the more content you create, the more chances you have to go viral. Not only that, but while I'm here, just to put a random side note in here, repins are key. And I'm actually giving you something that's totally, like, not even a part of selling digital products, but with the rise of tailwind tribes being so popular, It's really important to remember that when somebody pins your pin from a tribe, it counts as a new pin, not a re pin, and re pins are very, very key to going viral on the platform. For a pin to go viral, it has to have the initial engagement, and you can't get that just from tribes. So make sure that you aren't While you are focusing on tribes and your strategy, you're also focusing on other areas of Pinterest to ensure those repins are happening. Tip number 2 for Pinterest is something and this is I already mentioned this, but people need to see something on average seven to eight times before they purchase. Sometimes you get lucky and they purchase the first time, but most of the time, They won't. This is where that supporting content comes in. You can get hit for spam very easily with your account deleted on Pinterest However, if you're sharing just the landing page over and over and over again, that is not what you wanna do. If someone is clicking on your Pinterest pin, once they will see your content again and again. They may not see the same content or the same pin but they will see that supporting content that you've created. The more content you create not only allows you more options to go viral, but it also gives your audience more chances to see it. Therefore, giving them more chances to buy it. An awesome little bonus. I wanted to talk with you about the different types of digital products that you can create, there are a ton, as you can see here, ebooks courses, cookbooks, if you're a food blogger, audiobooks, printables, templates, this can literally work for anyone. It doesn't matter the niche you are in. Maybe you are somebody who, like I said, is a food blogger who has no idea how else to monetize except with ads. You could create a cookbook or a training, a video training or even a course on how to get started with cooking. There are so many different digital products that you can create, and that is why selling a digital product on Pinterest as a blogger can work for every single niche. If you wanted to create a journal or maybe you wanted to create a planner or something like that for your audience to track specific things, If you are in the mental health community, I know journals are really, really popular. I have some members inside of pinning profit currently that are working on doing a journal and also a planner so that they can track different things that are specific to them that they may not be able to find in a normal planner that you can get at TJ Maxx or something like that. And the other thing that I also wanted to talk to you about is pricing because I know how important pricing is, and this is also something I talk about inside of the program. However, I wanted to give you guys this little tidbit tip, about pricing your digital product So ebook should be ranging between 10 ish dollars $39. $39 is a very high side when you're selling on Pinterest and you're a beginner, I would definitely recommend staying within the\
\
Hannah Johnson [00:25:35]:\
$8.99 to $19.99 range And then for courses, those can range from $27 to\
\
Hannah Johnson [00:25:42]:\
$2,000 plus. It all depends on how much content you create. It all depends on what's included. maybe you are offering support or you are offering a bunch of additional items or bonuses then your your course is probably gonna be worth a little bit more than normal. Templates are the next product that we're gonna be talking about, and those can range from $5 to\
\
Hannah Johnson [00:26:09]:\
$39 or even above depending on what type of template that you're making. Planners can be, a template printables also go in this price range of 5 to $39. It really all depends on what you're creating, but that's a really good price range to start. If you are just starting out, I would recommend looking at the competition. What are they selling it for? maybe price yourself a little lower until you can get some sales. At launch, maybe you'll wanna give them a discount code. And then for video trainings, those depend on how many videos you have in your series. those can range from $15 to a\
\
Hannah Johnson [00:26:46]:\
$127 plus depending on what you are creating. A super, super important note as you are watching this only create one product at a time. I know how exciting it can be. I'm sure you have a 1000000 and 10 ideas rushing into your head on ways that you create a digital product and sell it on Pinterest, but only create one product at a time. It is so stressful to create a product in general. to launch it and to create actual profitable, consistent income from it. So you're gonna wanna only do one at a time. The other reason is because when you start adding more products to your to do list, you instantly become less productive And there's a whole entire science behind that. I promise you, you should you should create one product at time. And if you're curious on why I'm saying that if you try to create more than 1, you'll instantly become less, productive, you can check out the free master class that I have. I believe it's linked below. that talks about why you should only focus on one thing at a time, especially when you're creating a product after you've created this product and you've started making money and Pinterest's new sales on autopilot, then you can create another one. But for now, just focus on one.\
\
Hannah Johnson [00:28:11]:\
Just to give a little bit of a recap and a takeaway from today's talk, Pinterest users buy. They are coming to Pinterest to learn, to get inspiration, to get ideas, and to make purchasing decisions, and this goes for people that are offering services that are selling digital products, that are selling physical products, The reason why digital products are my favorite and in my opinion, the best way to go is because they are one and done. You can create something once and profit off it multiple times. They also allow your audience to get immediate access to the product and you're able to feed off their excitement. There are 4 pillars to selling success on Pinterest. Do your market research. Give something away for free with no email sign up necessary on the landing or sales page. You don't wanna make them give you an email address. You just wanna be a good Samaritan and give it away for free. just give it away. And if it hurts you to give it away, that means it's good. That means even though you are giving away maybe one trick out of your bag, you still have a whole bag left. Create that supporting content. For every digital product, you should at least make a minimum of 5 blog posts. If you wanna be super awesome, you can create 10, but I know it's difficult to create 10 supporting blog posts around one topic. and then always have a good Pinterest strategy. Make sure that you're making multiple pins per post. Make sure that you're sharing those pins. The fresh content is really awesome. The new pins, the reason why I told you each of those blog posts should have 10 pins is because that will give you enough to share 2 pins a week for 5 weeks, and then you can create more pins. stuff like that. I'm giving you little, little digestible nuggets here that will, allow you to be successful on the platform. If you have any other questions, you can feel free to find me on Instagram.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:30:12]:\
Alright, Hannah. Thank you so much for those, that that great information about how to better use Pinterest, not just to market content, but to market products and things that make you money, So thank you. Any final words on that?\
\
Hannah Johnson [00:30:27]:\
just if you are somebody that really, really wants to make money, especially, like, upfront, not have it take a 1000 years to do so. Digital products are the way to go. a lot of people are are talking about how blogging takes years to grow that following. You don't need a following, especially with Pinterest. Pinterest brings the following to you while also making you money by selling that digital content?\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:30:52]:\
Yes. So definitely take action on that. There's sessions on how to create various digital products in the summit, so watch those get going marketing on Pinterest. Hopefully, that will help you out. And I know you've got some great free resources for our attendees. Can you tell us about that?\
\
Hannah Johnson [00:31:07]:\
Yes. So I have a free master class. If you wanna check that out, I'm sure the links are below. And basically what that does is it walks you through some of the strategies that I teach, and also kind of talks a little bit more about kind of how Pinterest is used for digital product, selling. And I kind of get a little bit more specific on the mindset aspect of selling and that you're not really even selling. You're helping these people, which I'm sure is reiterated on their summit.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:31:38]:\
Yeah. We have a mindset session too. So, yeah, Don't you worry. but, yeah, but it is tough because, you know, people shy away from selling and so are -- Yeah.\
\
Hannah Johnson [00:31:47]:\
because it's definitely great.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:31:49]:\
resource for attendees. Definitely check that out. It's free. The link is below. And then I know you also have a special offer for our All Access Pass holders. Can you tell us about that?\
\
Hannah Johnson [00:31:58]:\
Yes. I have a new course in group coaching program that just launched this February. And, basically, the reason why it's formatted as a program is because There are a lot of courses and, digital products out there that kind of teach you how to utilize Pinterest and teach you how to sell and also make money with your blog, but they're lacking the support aspect. So, basically, what Pending profit does is it helps you step by step teach you how to create this passive con like, consistent passive income for bloggers and online entrepreneurs so you can kind of take that step up. and create this full time blogging life that you've wanted and that you've dreamed of.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:32:38]:\
Yeah. And you've got a discount. So so -- Yes. -- so for the All Access Pass, I always get a a exclusive discount how much how much was the discount?\
\
Hannah Johnson [00:32:46]:\
It's 40% off.\
\
Liz Stapleton [00:32:47]:\
Okay. Yeah. So that's that's a great deal. So if you guys are interested in kind of taking this a step further, getting that support, and you are an All Access Pass holder, or if you're not, get the All Access Pass. And then, you know, because the value of the All Access Pass is still gonna, like, save you more than what you would yeah. So definitely check that out. Hannah, thank you so much for your time. I really appreciate it.\
\
Hannah Johnson [00:33:08]:\
Of course. Thank you so much for having me.\

[00:00:11.930] - Jack Long\
Hey, hey, hey. Welcome to this exclusive quiz lead generation training with me Jack Long. And I'm really excited to be diving into the power of quizzes to help you grow your email list, segment your leads, and present your offers and your promotions based on where your prospects are currently at -- your prospect's current situation. So, if you're ready to start leveraging quizzes for your marketing power, you could see anything up to four to five times return on your investment and your revenues versus, say, offering an average PDF to your audience as a lead magnet. So, we're going to dive straight into this training. I like to just get on with things, and I want to just start this training by just saying quizzes are hot. You're in the right place right now if you want to create a quiz to grow your email list with hot leads. As you can see here with my screenshot that we've been running a campaign for the last 30 days and our quiz has received over 700 views, 702 views. And from those 700 people that viewed our quiz, they all went through the quiz, opted in and became a lead meaning our conversion rate for our quiz is 82 percent conversion rate, which is not to be snipped, especially as the average PDF can be 30 to 40 percent.\
\
[00:01:24.560] - Jack\
So it's double your PDF, if not triple your PDF, depending on what your PDF converts at. So, if we have 100 people we are sending to our quiz, 82 percent of our audience are becoming a lead and joining our email list is really exciting. Now, the other thing we love about quizzes is that it's the same effort to create a quiz than it is to create a PDF in, say, using a platform like Canva. It's the same energy to promote your quiz than it is to promote a PDF. It's the same budget to set aside for ads and marketing on advertising platforms than it would be to acquire a lead for a PDF. And it's the same audience. You're just going to send your quiz out to the same audience. But as you can see, the conversion rates there are far greater with the quiz. I'm going to be explaining exactly why quizzes are so powerful and how you can utilize the quiz for your marketing going forward to grow your business. So real quick, my name is Jack Long. I'm your go-to-quiz expert. I specialize in elevating digital entrepreneurs like yourself to grow your business with strategic power of an engaging quiz so that you can boost and grow and send more traffic to your website, send more traffic to your promotions, send more traffic to your launches, attract higher quality leads, but effortlessly generate more revenues as well with a quiz.\
\
[00:02:36.690] - Jack\
So I'm going to show you how you do that how you can generate more revenues by using a quiz. So, let's dive into this, right. Let's show you the power of a revenue rewarding quiz. So I've already explained quizzes are hot. They're highly engaging, as I've already shown you that as well. They're high converting, but they're also highly profitable. On the screen right now, these are some quizzes that I've created for my business for different --various angles to try and grow my email list with different people because I have different promotions running. And quizzes are really fun and engaging, and that's the whole purpose of a quiz, to attract the eye, grab your audience's attention, turn them into leads, and then very quickly turn them into a customer as well. And that's exactly what a quiz can do. So what I've got for you today is the number one thing that I want to share with you is you will get a full understanding and a whole method and strategy into how a quiz lead magnet could actually double your sales, okay, by just following my five very simple hacks, and I'm going to be giving those to you right now.\
\
[00:03:32.590] - Jack\
And this works if you are either you've already got a quiz, but maybe it needs some tweaking, or you're a first time quiz creator and you're really excited about diving into creating a quiz. And this is for -- this training is specifically for course creators, online coaches, membership program owners, digital products or service providers. Anybody who has a digital program or a course or anything like that online that you are selling your products and your programs online this is perfect for you. All right, so let's get straight into hack number one. How are quizzes more engaging than any other kind of content that you might be creating for your audience? How are quizzes engaging? So, let's take, for example, the online social media platforms and channels where you may be creating content on a weekly, daily, monthly basis to try and engage your, your audience. Now, obviously, we've got Instagram. We've got Facebook. We've got podcasts. We've got YouTube. It doesn't matter what platform you use. But I'm just going to quickly highlight Instagram for this very specific training because everyone knows what Instagram is. So how many posts -- this is the question I'm asking you, right? How many posts or how many stories or how many reels does someone who follows you, your audience, how many of those reels, stories, and posts do they need to engage with you on your Instagram channel before they become a customer. Right?\
\
[00:04:48.920] - Jack\
How many pieces of content does someone need to engage that you're posting on a weekly basis, on a monthly basis, on a yearly basis before they become a customer? Maybe the question should be, how many weeks does it take or how many months or how many years does it take for one of your Instagram followers to engage with your content to then become a customer? I'm going to average to say it's more than a month. Right? If someone follows you today, they're not going to become a customer tomorrow. At the very minimum, they might become a customer with you or work with you in some capacity maybe in a month's time. But it takes a long time these days to nurture your audience across any one of these channels whether it's Instagram, Facebook, you know, YouTube, TikTok, or wherever. Okay. So quizzes are a lot faster to engage with your audience and then ultimately warm them up to the point where they're just ready to buy from you instantly. Okay. And this is the power of a quiz and this is how it works. So, what we do first of all is we want to look at your -- the quiz kind of landing page. On the left-hand side there\
\
[00:05:49.980] - Jack\
you can see mine is brightly colored. It says take the quiz. It's like a superhero-style quiz that I've created. And it says, "What kind of marketing superhero are you?" Now, when they click on the button, it's a very, very micro step. Clicking on a button is very micro step to like like liking or hearting a post on Instagram. It's a micro step. Okay. But it's still an engagement. It's still a step where they are engaging with that piece of content. And once they've clicked from that take the quiz button, now we send them for a series of about seven questions. And each of your quiz questions is a piece of content that your audience will automatically engage with and interact with throughout your quiz. So, each of your question has a series of answers and they are engaging and they are like recognizing the answers or they are either, yes, that is me, or they're also saying, no, that is not me, or, yes, I like this, and no, I don't like this. They are telling you vital information about themselves. They're giving you vital data about who they are, where they are, what are their problems, what are their frustrations, what are their ideal solutions. Right?\
\
[00:06:57.670] - Jack\
What do they see? What do they envision in the future? What are they struggling with right now? And they do this across seven pieces of content because each of your quiz question, with all the answers, is seven pieces of different actual content, all right. And so, meaning that your audience will engage with your content at least seven times inside a quiz. Okay. And this is the power of a quiz. Now, we recommend you have about seven questions. If you have eight or if you have nine, it's okay. And there are very specifically -- there's an order that each of those questions go in a specific order in order so that your audience do actually finish your quiz because the last thing you want to do is your audience landing on question number one being turned off straight away and closing your quiz down. Okay. We don't want that to happen to you, so we have them in a very specific psychological order that works like a dream. So here's the thing, this -- if you look at quizzes, quizzes are engaging pieces of content. You can have images on quizzes. Okay. You can have -- obviously, you've got multiple-choice answers. You can have it in any color palette that you like, and your branding, and your wording, however you like to see fit.\
\
[00:08:06.530] - Jack\
You can have actual images as actual answers. Okay. You can have GIFs to make it more engaging. Whatever you want to do, however you want to create your content for your quiz you can make it really highly engaging. And again, if you think about reels and TikTok and other platforms, they are highly engaging with moving content, with polls, questions and answers. There are lots of those features inside those platforms, so your audience will easily take your quiz and will fully engage with the content inside your quiz. So that is why quizzes are really engaging. Your quiz takers will engage with your quiz at least seven times and they will engage with that content seven times in under three minutes and they will instantly then take action. No social media content can do that in this time frame. Think about it. That's that seven Instagram posts or seven Instagram stories or seven Instagram reels or a combination of those features on Instagram seven to eight times that your audience will be engaging with. Do they then take action and become a lead? Very unlikely so that's why quizzes are hot. Okay. Hack number two, how to quickly create a quiz lead magnet.\
\
[00:09:18.770] - Jack\
This is one question I get all the time. But Jack it sounds amazing. But doesn't it take ages to create a quiz. I wouldn't even know where to begin. It's actually really quite simple because I have simplified this to make it easy for you to be able to do. So there are really kind of four elements to what makes up a really high, engaging quiz to ultimately turn a cold lead into a warm hot, sorry, cold prospect, shall I say, into a warm, hot lead. So, the first step is by creating a landing page which is basically just a quiz title, a nice image that attracts your ideal audience, a small subtext, and then a button that simply just says take the quiz. That's the first step. It's a very quick and easy landing page. Then we've got the seven questions -- or each question is different. Each question leads your users, your quiz takers from one question to the next effortlessly. And each question is basically dissecting information from your ideal audience so that you can then understand where your audience are at so that you can sell more digital products or maybe new digital products, discover new things about your audience you didn't know. And then we've got an opt-in form.\
\
[00:10:16.870] - Jack\
We want to make sure that we grab their lead -- grab, sorry, their personal details and turn them into a lead. Right? We want to make sure they grab their details. And then we grab their details like their email address which is the most important detail we want there, and their information. We grab that before we give them their result. But remember, they're not taking small micro steps by watching a story or clicking a like or a heart on a post. They're actually engaging with seven questions. They're reading the question. They're choosing an answer -- moving on to the next question. They're engaging with the content. They've just taken seven large steps, okay, during your quiz questions. So, when it comes to the opt-in form, actually giving you their email address then now feels like a very small micro step again, and that's the power of a quiz. Okay. And then -- and then, of course, they're going to be dying at the same time -- they're going to be dying to see their quiz result. What is my result? Okay. Because we humans are very inquisitive people. We are dying to see a result about ourselves. We're dying to see what our next steps are in order to eradicate this problem that we've got.\
\
[00:11:15.440] - Jack\
What is our ideal personalized, tailored solution? We'll, we'll be dying to see this information and that will be the same for your audience as well. They're only five quiz-building steps that you need to follow. Step number one is your quiz title. Okay. We give you a formula so that you can very quickly follow our formula and, and craft your own high attention-grabbing title so that you always attract the right prospects to become a lead. Step number two is your audience, okay, your audience. Your quiz needs to be perfectly aligned to your audience. Okay. And we help you do that. Step number three is your quiz questions. Like I said before, there are seven questions -- seven psychological questions that go in a very specific order. I'm going to share with you how you can -- what those questions, sorry, look like later on. And then step number four is your quiz results. Of course, you want to wow your audience. You want to give them results so they take the next steps -- next action with you. And then step number five is once you've done steps one to four, you then plug that information into the actual quiz building software that we use, and the quiz building software is really easy.\
\
[00:12:16.100] - Jack\
It's as easy as just like writing an email in any other email CRM software you probably use as well. So, five really quick steps to get your quiz up and running and out there in no time as you can see here with some of our quiz students that we have who have taken my formula and gone through those five steps and created their own quiz. You can see they're eye-catching. And all of our students are in so many different niche markets offering so many different products and promotions and services on -- in the online space. So, you know, my own students have an amazing time in their quiz. They're growing their business and scaling their business with a quiz as the front funnel to grow their email list. Now, that's not all. As you know, quizzes are engaging. They're eye-catching, high converting, fun to create, easy to build. I've proven all of those things. But they're also highly profitable and here is how they're that. So the power of quizzes, this is my revenue rewarding quiz method that I teach my students. It's very quick to understand once you understand the methods of it, and it's incredibly powerful yet unbelievably simple. And when I teach it, my students always go, oh, my God, that is so incredibly genius and yet so simple.\
\
[00:13:22.490] - Jack\
Let me quickly show you how it is. This is how to sell more of your offers to your audience by having a quiz, no PDF, no cheat sheet. Not even a webinar can actually do this. Okay. So this is the problem we normally have or normally see with most marketers online trying to attract their ideal audience. You see, you probably -- most marketers see their audience as one whole collective. Okay. They see their audience, their community, as a whole collective. They, they think or they assume that their audience all have the same problem. So, if you think about the health and fitness is like, well, all of my audience have the same problem. They all want to lose weight. Okay. And you're going to, even if you're niche down, it's like, well, I know exactly who my audience are. They are, I know -- they are women who are over 40 and they all want to lose weight. So therefore, they assume instantly that their audience is the same person. They're all women over 40 that want to lose weight and they all want the same thing. But actually, that's the wrong way about thinking about it. And this is why a lot of people, a lot of businesses, should I say, struggle to scale their actual business.\
\
[00:14:25.520] - Jack\
So, let's look at the fitness and health as an example. And what we should be looking at our audience is an amazing array of colors, colorful, beautiful people, right. And as you can see here, I have kind of differentiated and separated this audience out now into four different colors. This is probably pretty much where the health and fitness example comes into play nicely for everyone to understand this. Okay. So you got gym member, too busy to exercise, tried every diet under the sun, and then yo- yo dieting. Okay. Now, this is really important because a quiz is going to ask your audience a series of questions. Okay. It's basically going to ask this audience here, the kind of bland looking blue and gray audience is how we all see our audience -- is going to ask this audience a series of questions over a course of seven psychological quiz questions. And then it's going to dissect these people and filter them and segment them into a very specific situation where these people -- this audience are at. So that now our marketer, okay, this could be you, me, whoever has the quiz, the quiz owner can now talk to this audience specifically based on their own situation and struggles and problems as to why they're unable, in this case, why they're unable to lose weight. Okay.\
\
[00:15:36.090] - Jack\
So, for example, if they discover someone's a gym membership, they can now very specifically talk to that person directly to their situation. Look, look I know, you know, you've got an expensive gym membership that you're going down the gym every single week and you're trying and you're grafting, you're putting the hard work and you've got an expensive membership that you're paying for but you're not seeing the results that you want. But if you join our program, not only do you cut your membership subscription in half, but you also, you know, can now start doing exercises from home. Start getting fit and healthy, and you actually get to start seeing the results that you really want. Check out Stacey. She used to have a gym membership. Check out Brad. He used to have a gym membership. Check out whoever. They used to have a gym membership and look at the results they're now getting since they joined our program. Let you see the power of what a quiz can now do. You can now be more specific and talk to your audience based of where they're at. And then again, you know, you're going to have a similar person. Again, there's another lady potentially who could be over 40 that wants to lose weight but is too busy.\
\
[00:16:34.900] - Jack\
Maybe this is a profession -- a professional person, right, in the corporate world. So now you can say, hey, look, I know you're too busy to exercise. I know that you're a professional person with a professional job, blah, blah, blah, blah. However, my program nicely fits around people who are too busy to exercise. We actually have exercise, you know, exercise regimes and training programs, fitness programs, sorry, that are only X minutes long and you can do them in between any time you're busy. And also, we've got an amazing meal plan that doesn't take hardly any time to create the most amazing, healthy meals so that you don't have to keep getting takeout food because you're too busy to cook. Okay. Our program is perfect fit for the too busy professional who's too busy to exercise. Okay. And then you can say again the same to the other people who tried every diet. I know you've tried every diet under the sun, but this is not a diet program or, you know, the yo- yo diets. I know that you lose weight, but you also put it on just as fast. That's because you've been doing it this way, this way, this way, and this way and, you know, that's not your fault.\
\
[00:17:36.520] - Jack\
You've just been sold some fad yo-yo diet. But actually, our program makes sure that you lose the weight and you keep it off for long term and you'll never get regain the weight again. So again, you can start talking to your audience based off of their situations, and this is the power of a quiz. So, let's think about marathon runners as another example -- as another quiz niche market. Okay. You're also instantly going to be like, hey, marathon runners ever wants to, you know, maybe take a course or a program to learn how to, oh sorry, not learn, but how to actually run a marathon. But the thing is you shouldn't be looking at your audience as everybody who wants to run a marathon. You see, you can have two, potentially more than two, but two different types of people who are going to be taking this quiz. You've got people that want to run a marathon. It could be their 100th marathon, but they want to somehow discover how they can run their personal best. And then you got others that want to discover, actually, what are the first steps I need to take to actually start to train to run a marathon?\
\
[00:18:29.580] - Jack\
Two very different people, but they all want the same outcome -- is the outcome is simply run a marathon. Right? I want to run a marathon. It's simple, but they're both two very different people who want to run a marathon for two very different reasons. And again, a quiz is going to allow you to talk to those people very specifically and sell products and courses and whatever services based off of their situation. And again, here's another example as an Instagram -- let's say we've got an Instagram expert who teaches there, I don't know, teaches course creators how to utilize the power of Instagram to sell more of their digital courses and products. So maybe their quiz is called, which Instagram feature should I focus on? Because you think about Instagram, there's so many features. There's Reels. There's Posts. There's Stories. There's this. There's that, and maybe our course creator doesn't know which one they should go all in on to feature on so they take the quiz. They answer all the questions. They enter in their email address and their name. They click on Submit, and they get to then see their result. But here's the interesting thing and the most amazing thing about quizzes is, let's say our Instagram expert has more than one course or product or toolkit or, you know, mini offer or membership to offer their audience, they've got an array of product suites to offer at any given time, well, then this is where the quiz comes into its true power.\
\
[00:19:46.040] - Jack\
You can now perfectly align your offers based off your audience's quiz results and that, ladies and gentlemen, is the power of a quiz. So there you go. That's the power of quizzes. You're leaving money on the table by not offering your products or your services when your audience needs it the most which is right now straight after they've taken the quiz, not in a month's time when you think you need to warm them up with emails and sending them out a ton of podcast episodes. Grab your audience at the hottest moment and a quiz can do that for you. And then hack number four: how to have your quiz wow your audience. So look who else has a quiz. Okay. This is one of the other reasons why we should all be focusing on having a quiz because a lot of the top online marketers like Amy Porterfield, like Lewis Howes, like James Wedmore, like Jenna Kutcher, like Brendan Pritchard, and many, many others all have a quiz in their business for them to grow their business. They have quizzes to grow their email list. They, they run a quiz during their launch events, during other promotions and other times of the year.\
\
[00:20:46.870] - Jack\
They are all offering quizzes to their audience, and here's Amy Porterfield's quiz as an example. As you can see, it's a really nice, eye-catching quiz. It looks incredibly professional and it's very enticing to take it. She's looking at the camera. It's in a nice pale kind of yellow. She's got a really enticing title. Its call to action simple, take the free quiz. And you want to discover what it is that she's offering here. Okay. This is the power of a quiz. There are no hurdles, okay, for your audience to jump over. It's simple. It's easy. Take the quiz, done. And that's why people like Amy Porterfield have quizzes. Here's one of my students. This is Lisa Woodford, and as you can see, right, Lisa's quiz is so eye-catching. Why is My Teenager Actually Driving Me Crazy and What Can I Do About It? So any parent who has a teenager in their house slamming doors, being grumpy, you know, not being very nice, hostile environment as a teenager can cause this quiz is going to grab that parent and say, yeah, I want to know why my teenager is driving me crazy, and I also want to know how I can deal with this.\
\
[00:21:51.400] - Jack\
So Lisa created a quiz and it's absolutely, you know, exploding her business for her. And as you can see, Lisa was originally giving away a free PDF. And a PDF is a great PDF, but her quiz is converting so much higher. But what Lisa did, and this is what we also teach, is take content you've already got. Take content from your free PDF. Take that amazing content inside there and put it into your quiz. Use some of your content in your PDF across your quiz questions and your quiz answers. Use some of the content in your PDF across your quiz results pages so that your audience are always reading the same content over and over again across different, different ways in way you're delivering it, whether it's a PDF or whether it's a quiz. It doesn't matter. But as you can see though, the conversions there are far greater with Lisa's quiz versus her PDF. Hack number five, final hack, quizzes can be simple when you follow the right method. And that is the one thing I need to say here is because a lot of people assume quizzes are difficult, and they're really not. Okay. A lot of our students aren't that tech savvy and that's okay, but they can create a quiz very quickly.\
\
[00:22:52.180] - Jack\
So, the first step that you need to do with your quiz creation journey is to create your quiz title. So, you need to determine who your quiz is for. What is your audience? Okay. What are your audience interested in? And what problems do you need to help solve for your audience? That is the first thing. You captivate a really high-engaging quiz title. Now, like I said, we've got a formula and a framework that our students follow and they create their quiz title literally in under 10 minutes. Really easy, but it's a high converting title. Step number two is your quiz audience. So, you want to make sure that your quiz attracts the right leads, but also at the same time repels the people who are not a good fit for your offers and your services. So I'm going to use a really simple example of this. Okay. Let's say you specialize in coaching women. Well, you don't want a bunch of men joining your email list, right? Because although you've got nothing wrong with that, of course, they're just not the right fit for your coaching program that's specifically for women. And so therefore, you want to repel people. And again, we teach people how to do this.\
\
[00:23:51.870] - Jack\
And it's such an important thing with marketing. You can't serve everyone. Trying to serve everyone in your audience will actually lead you to serving no one, and we actually have training in this as well and a mindset thing as well. It's really cool. Well, step number three, your quiz questions. There are seven psychological quiz questions, okay, not six, not eight, not nine, seven. And you must follow these seven questions in a very specific order so that your audience effortlessly finishes your quiz, and that your audience are then buzzing at the end of your seventh question ready to give you their email address and their name to see their quiz results. Step number four is your quiz results. Now, you should definitely be offering a digital product or a service or a call to action of any kind at the end of your quiz results page. It could be a product. It could be join your membership program. It could be jump on a call with you for a free 30-minute, free 30-minute call. It could even be, you know, a call to action to join your up and coming training program or a launch event like a five-day challenge or webinar. Whatever it is, meet your audience where they're at right now in the market space so that you can give them the right next step going forward.\
\
[00:25:02.420] - Jack\
And that step going forward is with you, not a competitor. Step number five, your quiz launched. So, once you've done the first four steps, building your quiz is really easy. It takes probably no more than half an hour. So, build and launch your quiz to the world via social media, paid advertising, and even have your fans promote your quiz for viral potential. Okay. So now, are you ready to create a quiz? Because if you're not nodding, going, oh, my God, this is amazing. This is going to smash anything out of the park. Nobody in my -- nobody in my niche market is offering anything like this. I need to jump on this right now. Then this is the perfect time for you.

\
[00:26:18.100] - Jack\

**Transcript:**\
[00:00:13.370] - Jesenia\
Hello. My name is Jesenia and I am a lead support specialist at Media Vine. And today, I'm going to share some tips and information to help you optimize your existing content for maximum earnings.\
\
[00:00:27.850] - Jesenia\
So, you're going to want to check your top performing post, find what content to focus on and break it down. And how you're going to do that is by looking at your Google Analytics, you're going to want to see what's driving readers to your site, whether your goal is to increase earnings or traffic. Learning what content your audience is looking for when they visit your site is going to be the key to your site's growth. You can also find information and search console. Again, see what's bringing readers to your site.\
\
[00:00:55.920] - Jesenia\
What are you ranking for? You can also do this by going to your Media Vine dashboard. If you have Media Vine ads on your site, from there, you can check what are your top performing pages? Which pages are earning you the most money and see what your readers are looking for? You can also check in Pinterest.\
\
[00:01:15.210] - Jesenia\
You can see what your top performing pins are. If you do get a lot of Pinterest traffic. And again, just see what your site is trending for. If you do decide to look at your Google Analytics account, there's a wealth of information there that goes beyond just the number of sessions and traffic sources. For example, you can check out on their pages and see what your, you know the reader behavior is.\
\
[00:01:39.060] - Jesenia\
So you would just go under behavior site content and from there you can check the top pages and then you can also add some. You can actually get some more detailed information from your readers by adding some secondary dimensions, so you can see where they're coming from, what devices they're using when they visit your site, and much more. So again, find out how your readers are getting to your site, determine what's driving them there, what content, and use this information to create future content and or update existing content. This information is going to help you gauge what your current trends are and what future trends are for your site. And check often.\
\
[00:02:21.450] - Jesenia\
Check your trending content. Often you might not realize that an old post is trending, but it's missing images or video, or maybe it doesn't have information that's relevant anymore. So, always check. I always say check weekly or monthly and sometimes even daily. If you notice that you're having a spike in traffic, find out why. It could be an old post that was shared on another site.\
\
[00:02:47.960] - Jesenia\
It might be that it's suddenly trending on Google. Look at it and see why are the readers going to your site and also make sure that the post is well optimized and it's also current. And when promoting your content, make sure that you're following the money. What is the post that's making you the most money right now? What's making the most money either from ads, affiliate income, if you're selling products or offering a service.\
\
[00:03:14.980] - Jesenia\
Those are the content that you're going to want to promote, especially like if you're promoting on Facebook. If you're promoting on a social platform and you're boosting these posts, that's what you're going to want to put your dollars behind. And again, look at the previous year and see what content was trending before. Odds are it will probably trend again the next year and also focus on the present.\
\
[00:03:39.970] - Jesenia\
What is driving readers today to your site and see how that can help you prepare future content, you know. One of the things that you can do with this information is help you prepare your content calendar, create your marketing plans, and also just help you focus on what you want to market to your audience.\
\
[00:04:04.270] - Jesenia\
So, you're going to want to track your progress and growth. Use a spreadsheet. You can use Google Docs or Air Table and you're going to want to add your top performing posts. You can do this by views, or you can do this by the posts that are making you the most money. So you choose which ones you want to track, or you can do both and Mark down what changes you're making.\
\
[00:04:25.640] - Jesenia\
And when you're making those changes. You want to make sure that you have something to look back on and gauge what the actual growth was. So, you're going to want to, for example, if you make a small change and which is what we actually suggest, don't make any major changes. Just make a few small changes at a time. You're going to want to revisit that and see okay, did I have any progress? Did it make a difference and then go and make the next change and that's going to help you see how you're gradually, you know whether it's increasing more engagement or if you're getting more sessions to that particular post, or perhaps you're getting readers to stick around a little bit longer.\
\
[00:05:08.370] - Jesenia\
So, now the bounce rate is lower. Those are the things that you're going to want to track and when so that way you know whether or not these changes are having any effect. Basically, your progress is going to be gradual. So that's why it's a good way to track things.\
\
[00:05:24.320] - Jesenia\
They're not going to happen overnight. Long content is King. We suggest that you write at least 300 to 500 words. This is going to help with engagement. This is going to help with SEO.\
\
[00:05:37.690] - Jesenia\
Another way to do this is by adding images varying sizes. But we do suggest that you use verticals when possible, that's going to actually add more length to the page. Also, make sure that the images are full sized so that they are the same width as your content and space them throughout the post. For example, instead of writing maybe all of your content and then adding all of the images of each step kind of weave in some of the content between the images. So, it's just nicely spaced out. It just visually appears a lot nicer, but it's also just going, again to add that length to the content and not have readers skipping over all of your images because they're all stacked after each other.\
\
[00:06:21.970] - Jesenia\
You're also going to want to focus on keeping your audience engaged. Make sure your most valuable content is the last thing that they see. Again, we want the long content to be there because it helps, but most importantly, you want it to be valuable to your readers. Think about your audience, what's keeping them engaged? What are they there for?\
\
[00:06:46.780] - Jesenia\
Are they there for video? Are they there for a printable? Are they there for a recipe? So, make sure that that valuable content is not at the top of your post. Once they get that, they're likely going to leave.\
\
[00:06:59.550] - Jesenia\
So, let's keep them engaged. Let them read your content in its entirety so that they can get all the tips and tricks and things that you wanted to share with them and then put that valuable content at the very end. Don't assume that you know what the readers want, and say, here it is. Let them actually see everything and then give them that valuable content.\
\
[00:07:22.890] - Jesenia\
At the very end of the post. You can lend in your content by increasing the font size and the line height. If you're not sure what yours is currently, you can actually do that by going to Chrome and using the developers tool, and that will give you that information. We suggest that it's at least 16 Pixel or higher. And again, for your line height 1.5 M or more, and you can actually check out our blog and YouTube channel.\
\
[00:07:48.030] - Jesenia\
We have tons of tips on how to do this and what our recommendations are on this particular topic. You also want your paragraphs to be one of three sentences and the reason why a lot of your readers are going to be viewing your content on mobile. So, you don't want those very large paragraphs that perhaps don't look so long on desktop to appear over multiple screens on mobile. Again, add images. If you don't have a lot of images, people are visual. People want to see images.\
\
[00:08:21.200] - Jesenia\
People want to see video. Again, add video, write more words. But again, make sure it's valuable content. Don't just add words to add words and something that's very important and a good way to also not just add length to your content, but increase reader engagement, is to pull reader feedback into the post. So, an easy way to add length to your content is answering frequently asked questions or including reader feedback or tips that are shared with you in the comments section or via email.\
\
[00:08:52.170] - Jesenia\
So, pulling that reader feedback into the post is a great way not only to add length to your content, but also increase reader engagement. And view your site on mobile. The majority of readers and users are viewing a lot of the online content on their mobile devices, sometimes on tablet, and there's still a few on desktop. And it also depends obviously, on your specific site. If you have an educational site, you probably have more desktop readers. But again, assume that most of your readers are looking at your content on mobile.\
\
[00:09:28.920] - Jesenia\
You can view this data on analytics and Google Analytics, so you can see if that's where they're coming from, but the majority will probably be on a mobile device. So, when you're doing optimizations, it's super important that you're looking at mobile because that's where your readers are. When editing content on desktop, use the Developers tool to view the mobile version of your post. As bloggers, we tend to view our content on desktop, but you're going to want to see what your readers are seeing. And again, bite size content is going to be easier for them to digest on those mobile screens, since it's a lot smaller.\
\
[00:10:00.650] - Jesenia\
And if you can see here even that second paragraph, that's just one sentence. So, when we say one or three sentences, this is why, because it's going to appear much larger on that smaller mobile screen. Don't make it easy for your readers to leave. Assess which buttons and links offer the most value to your readers and to your site. Keep the print button in the recipe card.\
\
[00:10:26.410] - Jesenia\
If you are a food blogger, don't give your readers a reason to leave your site immediately. Keep that button down in the recipe card. Once they print it, odds are they're going to leave. So, anything of value again, put it down at the bottom of the page at the end of the post. Don't give it to them at the very beginning.\
\
[00:10:48.710] - Jesenia\
Don't make the assumption that that's what they want, because again, it's not easy to get the reader to your site. Don't give them a reason to leave quickly. You don't need multiple variations of a social share button. If you already offer a Pinterest button or a Facebook Share button, you don't need multiple ones throughout the site. Figure out where you want to place that.\
\
[00:11:12.940] - Jesenia\
Leave it there. You don't need to add one on the side, on the top, in between. Just choose one and stick to that and also use a heat map tool and post with a higher bounce rate to see how readers are engaging with the content. Why are they leaving so quickly? Are they leaving at the beginning of the post?\
\
[00:11:32.360] - Jesenia\
Are they leaving because they're clicking on an external link? Find out what's going on and try to eliminate that roadblock so that you can keep those readers around a lot longer. One thing is that readers spent a short amount of time viewing a site, so sometimes it's just seconds. So, you want to eliminate any reason to have them leave your site. The ultimate goal is to keep them engaged for as long as possible.\
\
[00:12:00.600] - Jesenia\
And again, we want to keep readers on your site because whether you have ads or you're doing affiliate links or you're offering a product or a service, you want to maximize your earnings. The way to do that is to keep them on your site as long as possible. So, link to your own content. Spread those links throughout the post, not just as a roundup at the very end. If you're talking about a particular topic and you're mentioning a specific recipe or you're mentioning a specific resource, and you have this resource on your site, make sure to link it within the actual content and use good anchor text.\
\
[00:12:42.260] - Jesenia\
Link those keywords and be very strategic about your external links. It's okay to use them if they are adding value to your content. But make sure that you're not inserting all of those that say at the very beginning of the content and having your readers leave immediately because they already found something else they want to look at. So, be very strategic with those and make sure that you're using those that are offering value to your readers and not just inserting them and potentially losing a portion of your audience because of it. And you're also going to want to enable grow that me, which is one of Media Vine plugin and the related content feature, is going to be a great way to allow your readers to save those favorite pages. And it's going to recommend content to them that's based on their browsing activity versus just showing them content.\
\
[00:13:42.670] - Jesenia\
That's about the same subject. So, it's a great tool to keep again, those readers around a lot longer invaluable content is key. Keywords matter. We also suggest that you avoid any problematic words.\
\
[00:14:00.150] - Jesenia\
Keep a PG, target your audience and also follow the trends, holidays, viral content. If you again are noticing that you're suddenly trending for something that maybe you weren't trending for before, see where that audience is coming from. And use that for any future content that you're going to share with the audience to share with your readers. Content rules. At the end of the day, yes, you want to have a well optimized post. You want to have well optimized content, but you want to ensure that what you're offering your reader is valuable and that's going to keep bringing them back.\
\
[00:14:40.640] - Jesenia\
And it's also going to help you rank as well because Google is going to keep showing your particular post or your particular content to those readers that you're seeking. And also how to increase impressions. We haven't discussed necessarily anything ad specific, but if you are running ads, just make sure that again you insert vertical images at a hard return between pictures and text. This is going to help with those ad placements. Embed post specific videos on pages that are trending. Try to increase time on the page on your site.\
\
[00:15:16.020] - Jesenia\
The longer that readers are there, the longer that they're engaged, the more ad impressions you're going to receive. Again, grow me. Use the Recommended Post feature, increased font size to 18 pixels. We recommend at least 16, but again, depending on your site, it might be higher, line height of 1.5. Check impressions per page on top ten to 20 posts.\
\
[00:15:42.070] - Jesenia\
Look for anything that might be a roadblock. What could be driving those readers out? Again, you can do this by using a heat map tool, so if they're leaving the page at a certain point, use this information so that you can remove those roadblocks. And also, you can do this with posts that are doing really well and see what is working for your site and use that when you're creating future content and replicate it with those. And set clear goals.\
\
[00:16:11.510] - Jesenia\
More importantly, just do one thing at a time, but just make sure that it's not a one and done thing. Blogging the marathon is not a sprint. Don't get discouraged if you make changes and you don't see results right away. That's why it's so important for you to track your progress. You may not realize that all these little actions are leading to something bigger and a year from now, you may realize that suddenly your engagement is up way higher.\

Bounce rate is low. Your sessions are double. But again, you're not going to notice that immediately. So, make sure that you're tracking things and then tackle one or two posts a week. You know you can start with your top performing pages based again on views or what's making you the most money.\
\
[00:16:58.320] - Jesenia\
So, you decide you know which way you want to go and just work on those and do a little bit at a time, but do it continuously. Don't just one and done and then forget about it for a few months. Just make it a habit to always revisit your content and make sure that everything, even create a checklist for yourself to make sure that certain things that you want to make sure are on the post, whether it's images, videos, recommended content, et cetera, that those things are in place and just keep coming back. There's always going to be work to do. But the biggest thing is that by increasing traffic to your site and just building your online presence, you're going to be able to reach a larger audience.\
\
[00:17:44.460] - Jesenia\
And at the end of the day this is going to convert either to more ad revenues or sales depending on what your goal is and you want to provide great information. I mean, we know that that's the goal and you want to connect with your readers. But the bottom line is that you also want your business to make money and that's what you want to be able to do with all of this. So, just set those goals, revisit them and constantly take action and that's going to pay off in the end. And thank you for your time.\

[00:00:12.170] - Jessica\
Hi and welcome. I'm Jessica Evans, owner and CEO of Ultimate Bundles, and I'm thrilled to have you here for this presentation. I'm going to walk you through today my top five tips to increase your conversions now. Let's get started. Okay, a little bit about me.\
\
[00:00:28.920] - Jessica\
Now. I am not only the owner and CEO of Ultimate Bundles, but I'm also a wife, a mother, baker, and obsessed crafter, and also working on my organization skills. That will probably be something I do forever. Little ADHD here, so can't help myself. I've got two girls, 14 and 9, and they are growing so fast and keeping me on my toes every step of the way.\
\
[00:00:51.470] - Jessica\
I call Michigan home, and I've been here my entire life, and I will probably remain here. I love Michigan. I have to be near water. We love boating and camping, and both are wonderful things to do here in the Mitten State.\
\
[00:01:07.350] - Jessica\
So, today what you're going to learn why affiliate marketing is so powerful and how to be successful at it. Again, I'm going to share my top five tips so you can increase your conversions now. Why should you take my advice? Well, let me give you some background. As I mentioned before, I'm the owner and CEO of Ultimate Bundles, but I was a successful blogger first.\
\
[00:01:32.590] - Jessica\
I created my first blog in 2015, and that was Follow My Arrow. It's still around. It's just not as active these days. I'm a little busy on the side. I also became an affiliate for UB, and that was my highest paying program to date.\
\
[00:01:52.290] - Jessica\
I joined the UB team as a member of the Customer Happiness Team in 2017. Because I loved the products and the team, it just made it such an easy job to do.\
\
[00:02:05.030] - Jessica\
I became the manager of Customer Happiness here at UB in 2018, and that was such an honor. I submitted my first product to the master. Your Money super bundle in 2019. That was my first step to commit to my blog, so I was really committed to making money at that point. I wanted to make it more than a hobby, but something that I could do for life, honestly.\
\
[00:02:29.710] - Jessica\
So, my blog monthly earnings grew to five figures in 2021. It took time, definitely, was not overnight, but I believe that sustainable growth takes time. Then this year, 2022, my most exciting decision yet, I purchased UB. That has been an adventure so far, and I can't wait to see where it takes us next.\
\
[00:02:55.290] - Jessica\
So, let's get started with the presentation. Okay, tip five. Keep your list warm. Why? Well, you want everyone to have you at the top of mind, right?\
\
[00:03:09.300] - Jessica\
So, don't disappear between promotions. You can't just sell. You have to offer valuable content at all times, honestly. You can use newsletters. Coffee chats. I love coffee chats. Those are my favorite newsletters styles to send. Blog post roundups are great as well. And free resources in between promotions, by far the best way to keep your audience warm. Now remember that you want your brand, like I said, to stay in the front of everyone's mind.\
\
[00:03:41.270] - Jessica\
So, you have to show up. You've got to be there. You want to be seen as trustworthy, resourceful, helpful. Don't ghost them. Instead, be their go-to for whatever niche you're in.\
\
[00:03:52.410] - Jessica\
Be consistent. So, it's definitely not enough just to be showing up. If you're not consistent, they're not going to know when to expect your messages. If you send on a whim, you won't build any authority. Tip four, write a blog post.\
\
[00:04:11.420] - Jessica\
Okay, this is an easy one. If you're going to promote something, write a blog post. Share the nitty gritty. You can't do that in email, right? That would make for a really long email message and no one's going to read that.\
\
[00:04:25.010] - Jessica\
You can get into the details. You could even do a review on whatever it is that you're trying to promote. Now for bundles, because I've done this so often and I'm also here owning the company, reviewing our bundles is an awesome way to do it. You can make this almost evergreen. If you do so, link everything.\
\
[00:04:48.990] - Jessica\
That means make it so easy for anyone to click and find more about whatever it is that you're promoting. I'm talking the logo, okay? Anything with brand on it, anywhere that says, any messaging that is relevant. Make it hyperlinked. Just make it ridiculous easy, ridiculously easy to purchase the product.\
\
[00:05:15.250] - Jessica\
Okay? Question for you. How large is your following? Who do we have here? Send it and let's share it in chat.\
\
[00:05:22.610] - Jessica\
Are you a guppy? Are you under like 100,000, or I'm sorry, a 1000. Tuna, 10,000 or less. Shark, 25,000 or more? Whale, 50,000.\
\
[00:05:36.830] - Jessica\
Where are you? I'd love to see. So share it, please.\
\
[00:05:42.190] - Jessica\
Okay, on to the next tip. Tip three. Utilize Pinterest. Pinterest is amazing. It's my go-to.\
\
[00:05:49.400] - Jessica\
It doesn't matter if you're going to promote it. It doesn't matter what you're going to do. Pin your darn post. It's [inaudible 00:05:54] search engine. You want people to find you, so you don't need just Google.\
\
[00:05:59.110] - Jessica\
Pinterest is great too.\
\
[00:06:02.770] - Jessica\
Promote your pin. If you really, really want to get serious, promote your pin. It's a great way to get the momentum going and it's a great way to keep it going. So, I've had a few pins, especially seasonal, that have done fabulous, and they do this year after year. One in particular is a scavenger hunt, and it's for Easter. I get thousands of email subscribers every March and April, thousands from one pin.\
\
[00:06:32.630] - Jessica\
And it was just a scavenger hunt that I did with my girls. Decided to write about it, make it a printable, and boom, I've grown my list. Now, a couple of things here. There's a few options depending on your list size, because your email size does not necessarily matter for affiliate promotions, as long as they're active and as long as they see you as authority and trustworthy, you're pretty good. So, when it comes to Pinterest, let Pinterest find your ideal audience.\
\
[00:07:05.340] - Jessica\
If you're going to go ahead and promote a Pin. And you're not sure of your audience, you have a small audience already, let Pinterest find your ideal audience. You could also create a lookalike. Now this I would suggest for somebody that has at least, probably, 3000 email subscribers. And you can actually take your list and have that be created using your lookalike.\
\
[00:07:33.730] - Jessica\
Select the demographics of your ideal person. That's great for someone that has nothing. And it's a really fun way to try to corner where your people are. You have to know a lot about your audience. You have to know what they like, where they shop, what they do in order for this to work.\
\
[00:07:52.410] - Jessica\
But it's a great tool as well. All right, tip number two. We're getting really close to my number one tip, but tip number two, this is super important. Promote the prelaunch. When you're doing any type of promotion, the prelaunch is essentially a warm up for your audience.\
\
[00:08:12.350] - Jessica\
They are usually offering a free item. So, whether it's an ebook maybe, or maybe like an email challenge, there's so many different things, a webinar, all these things. It's a great way to introduce your audience to the brand. And plus, okay, this is a real great part. You get those cookies.\
\
[00:08:39.110] - Jessica\
So, if you're an affiliate, you're going to be cookied. So, basically, you're tracked. All these folks that you're sending, they will be tracked to your affiliate ID. Those will continue on through the sale. \
\
[00:08:54.190] - Jessica\
So, you're really just getting more traffic tagged to you to your affiliate ID in order to earn more money later. And a real big bonus to this, you're going to get extra attention for your audience. Why? Because you're going to have more help with your promotion. While those folks are on the email list of the company that you are promoting, they're also going to be promoting the product.\
\
[00:09:21.520] - Jessica\
So, you're going to have yours that go out to them. You're going to have the company that you're promoting going out to them. And it's a great way to keep this item top of mind. It's free promotion for you. You still earn money from the sales.\
\
[00:09:37.130] - Jessica\
That's not going to change, but you're getting the extra help from the actual company that's promoting. Okay, another question. What is your biggest fear when it comes to emailing? Now drop this in chat because I'd love to hear. Are you afraid of unsubscribes? Are you afraid of just emailing too much?\
\
[00:09:57.070] - Jessica\
What is your biggest fear? All right, so this one, as you can guess, is all about your inbox emailing. Okay? Tip one, show up in their inbox.\
\
[00:10:10.620] - Jessica\
This is so important. If you don't show up in their inbox, they don't know you, they won't remember you. They're not going to be able to purchase anything from you. What I suggest, email daily minimum. I can't stress this one enough, honestly. You can't share your knowledge if you don't email.\
\
[00:10:28.410] - Jessica\
Not every email will be opened by every subscriber to the likelihood of anyone being overwhelmed or having that spammy feeling from your messages. Slim to none. Share a story with each email. So, don't just come out with a hard sell. Share a story.\
\
[00:10:45.730] - Jessica\
Something personal. It doesn't have to be long, just short and sweet, but something to make you feel human. Use the resources provided. Now this, this is gold. When you're promoting, you're going to have assets available to you.\
\
[00:11:01.700] - Jessica\
You'll have a promotion schedule which will probably give you exactly what you should be doing as far as email, social media, any of that. You'll also have graphics and swipe. Utilize it. It's great to get going.\
\
[00:11:17.110] - Jessica\
Now, one of the things that you want to do in order to make sure you don't get a high number of unsubscribes is to have an opt out. But not just one as an unsubscribe that's standard in an email. You want one specifically for this promotion. Allow them to opt out very easily to the promotion.\
\
[00:11:37.690] - Jessica\
That way you don't lose them from your list, but you also don't overwhelm them with something they have no interest in. It's really, really easy. Just add that top, middle to somewhere on your email, and it will allow you to keep those subscribers that still love you, just don't love the offer. Remember, unsubscribes are good. This is a huge reminder for everyone.\
\
[00:12:03.910] - Jessica\
You don't want those folks that have no interest in what you are offering on your list. You're paying for them to do nothing, paying for them just to sit there, bring down your stats. You don't want that. So every time you email, you are essentially pruning your list, right? Makes sense.\
\
[00:12:23.870] - Jessica\
You want to only reach those that are truly your people. Okay, quick recap.\
\
[00:12:32.510] - Jessica\
First thing is first, keep your list warm. What do you do next? Write a blog post. Number three. Utilize pinterest.\
\
[00:12:41.790] - Jessica\
And then of course, promote the prelaunch. And finally, just keep showing up in their inbox. I'm telling you, these things will change your conversions and change them now. Doesn't matter what size your list is, it does not matter. Your following can be small or large.\
\
[00:12:57.300] - Jessica\
This will work. Okay, you want some more? You can check out my affiliate guide. I have linked that down below and you can grab that and it has even more tips for you to up your conversions now.\
\
[00:13:11.630] - Jessica\
Questions? I'd love to hear them, throw them in chat and I would be happy to answer anything. Okay, are you guys ready to up your affiliate game? Well, I will tell you about our affiliate program. We have the affiliate upshot program and it is amazing.\
\
[00:13:32.450] - Jessica\
Now, we have paid out over $10 million in commissions to our contributors and affiliates over the past ten years. That's wild. I still can't believe that number. It's just so large. Okay, why should you do this?\
\
[00:13:47.550] - Jessica\
Every bundle is a value. It's an incredible value. Okay, our discounts 90% to 97% off. I mean, who wouldn't want that? Also, you'll make a generous commission.\
\
[00:13:59.780] - Jessica\
I mean, that's great. That's what we're here for, honestly. We need to actually make money to continue doing what we love. Right? This has got to be a job.\
\
[00:14:08.500] - Jessica\
We have to see it as a business. We need to make some type of income. Okay, and what else? You'll learn about marketing from the bust? Before each bundle, we offer market training to our affiliates, and our portal is full of all kinds of resources to help you.\
\
[00:14:26.360] - Jessica\
So, I'd love to have you join us. Well, that's a wrap. I hope you enjoyed the presentation, and if you'd like to stay connected, you can find us at ultimatebundles.com, followmyarrow.com, Instagram, and Facebook. It was great chatting with you all, and I hope to see you guys again soon. Bubye.\

**Transcript:**\
Jessie Festa [00:00:12]:\
Hey everyone, my name is Jessie Festa, and I am so excited to be here with you today to talk about how to create a paid newsletter for recurring revenue. We'll be going over a 5 step strategy that's going to take you from coming up with your newsletter idea and designing it, all the way through getting it set up, pricing it, to marketing it, to retaining members, and more. We will be covering a lot. Just a little bit about me before we get started, I started travel blogging in 2011 after graduating with my BA in communication and ultimately deciding that the 9 to 5 office life wasn't for me. I am a full time travel blogger. My blogs are Jesse on a Journey and Epicure & Culture. I'm also a blog coach with a number of courses as well as my signature travel blog prosperity membership community. If anyone else here is into travel, happy to chat.\
\
Jessie Festa [00:01:07]:\
Some of my favorite destinations have been Bhutan, Panama, Latvia, and Mongolia. I'm about to set off to Kyrgyzstan as well, very excited about that. And I believe that the best way to monetize is through helping your audience, which is exactly what we'll be going over how to do in this workshop. So before we get into the actual step by step strategy, let's just quickly talk about what a paid newsletter is, and why you should start one. So a paid newsletter is an email newsletter that subscribers pay to receive, thanks to the education, entertainment, and/or value it provides, and this is really key. Many of you are probably sending out a free newsletter, and of course, that should have value, but if people are paying you, the content really needs to go above and beyond what you are sending for free, and we'll go over how to do that, how to come up with that value. Now some benefits of starting a paid newsletter include earning recurring revenue for more predictable income. It'll also help you position yourself as an expert in your niche or your industry.\
\
Jessie Festa [00:02:17]:\
Another key benefit of starting a paid newsletter is it allows you to provide premium content to your community without ads and promotions. It also, depending on the content of your newsletter, can be relatively easy to create, and we'll look at some examples of different types of content that you can include, but it could be pretty easy, especially compared to like a premium course. Okay, so now let's talk about the strategy starting with step number 1, choose the value you'll deliver. Really think about who you help and how, and you know when you are starting, I'm a blogger, but whether you have a blog or another type of business, you'll have some type of mission statement. I help blank group of people do how you help, or some version of that, and your paid newsletter should be an extension of that so that your business is nice and cohesive. You wanna think about the problems and pain points that your audience faces, or if there's something that they're seeking from you specifically. For example, there are paid newsletters that aren't necessarily solving very specific problems, but they these people starting these newsletters have some type of following. Maybe their readers love their writing.\
\
Jessie Festa [00:03:34]:\
Now I highly recommend that you keep track of the questions that people ask you. This is direct insight into what they want from you, and I know for me, every single product and service I've ever created has come from looking at the questions that people were asking me, and I recommend you also think about how you can help solve the problems and pain points that your audience faces or make their lives better in some way through your newsletter. And to really, really, really see success with a newsletter, I recommend thinking about how you can solve a recurring information problem. I do this with my newsletter, and I'll give you this example on the next slide, but maybe you are sending a list of opportunities, leads, or deals, that's what I do for mine. Maybe your newsletter shares in-depth insights, reports, or case studies that go beyond like the free articles that exist online. Maybe it's educational content, more like a a course through a newsletter, and maybe you're even giving your newsletter subscribers feedback on their work. Maybe it's a behind the scenes look into your unique process or exclusive bonus content or early access similar to what people offer on Patreon. So here's an example of my newsletter.\
\
Jessie Festa [00:04:55]:\
I have a VIP opportunities newsletter for travel bloggers where I send 5 paid blogger opportunities to their inbox every Monday. So in terms of my mission for my business, I help travel bloggers grow their traffic and income. The problems and pain points that my audience faces include trying to monetize, time, including in terms of having time to implement strategies, and how long it takes to monetize a blog. It's it's a lot longer for most people than they think. Also, making connections. As someone who's been blogging a long time, I've been able to make a lot of connections, and I use these to add value to my newsletter either by, you know, when when someone emails me with an opportunity, I ask them, hey, can I include this in my newsletter? Newer bloggers aren't maybe getting these same emails from connections like this, but I kind of help to bridge the gap in that way. And in terms of how can you help solve the audience's problems and make people's lives easier through a newsletter, I do this by sending growth and income opportunities straight to their inbox to save them time and help them monetize faster. Now going back to that idea of solving a recurring information problem, my audience, you know, they continually need to make money to grow their business, and part of that for many blockers is looking for leads.\
\
Jessie Festa [00:06:15]:\
So again, I'm bridging that gap, and I'm helping them every Monday kind of solve this problem through that paid newsletter. Here's another example from the desk of Alicia Kennedy. Alicia has built an audience who loves her food writing, and she has a really unique approach to food writing. It's not just the typical sort of restaurant reviews and things like that, and people love it, and they want to hear from her more. So she does have a free newsletter where she sends Monday essays, but if you opt for the paid newsletter, you get additional kind of series that she does. Now we haven't got into tech yet, but she uses Substack, and you can see with Substack it's really easy to make subscribing to a paid newsletter kind of the first and foremost thing people do. When you go to the website, you have on the left that screenshot asking you to subscribe right away. If you put your email in there, it will take you to your different payment options, the limited free newsletter, or the different subscription options.\
\
Jessie Festa [00:07:17]:\
There's also that subscribe button right at the top, and if you click into one of these articles you see here on the right that is part of the paid newsletter, for example, the desk book club, that's a paid column she does for the paid newsletter. If you click that, it will prompt you to subscribe to the paid newsletter. Here's another example. This is Ashley Gets Around, and she sends her paid subscribers premium flight deals and mistake fares. She also has a limited free version of her newsletter where you get just a couple of deals, but those really, really premium ones go to her paid subscribers. Another thing to think about is, do you have products? If you do, consider what newsletter you could pitch as a natural add on or upsell to your other related digital products. This is a benefit of really keeping your business cohesive, really thinking about your mission so that everything can kind of connect and cross promote. So for example, one of my products is a brand pitch bundle.\
\
Jessie Festa [00:08:22]:\
It helps people learn how to pitch. It also helps them find brands that work with bloggers, and a natural extension of that is, hey, subscribe to this paid newsletter, and you'll get even more opportunities to work with brands. Now if you don't have a digital product, consider creating one to cross promote with the newsletter. It's another little idea there. Okay. So moving on to step 2 with our strategy, you want to design your newsletter. Think about what will it include, and with this also consider the time investment, and if it matches the amount of time you reasonably have. Because as we are talking about in this next part, how often will it go out? It maybe goes out daily, weekly, monthly, something else, but you wanna choose a schedule that is consistent above all else.\
\
Jessie Festa [00:09:11]:\
That is what is most important. If you're telling people it's going to go out weekly and then you have weeks that you're missing, that's going to be a really, really bad user experience. Also, how much will it cost? According to Convertkit, the average price of a paid newsletter is $11 per month, and the range is typically $5 per month to $40 plus per month. So let's do a little math determining your potential revenue. So according to Convertkit, a 5% free to paid conversion rate is a good general rule for a well nurtured list. So if you charge that average $11 per month for your newsletter and you currently have 1,000 email subscribers, you can expect to onboard about 50 paid subscribers and earn about $550. Now because we're thinking about this conversion rate here, it can be helpful to build a following first. If you already have a 1,000, a few 1,000, 10000 plus subscribers on your email list and they're well nurtured, and they already love your free content, you're going to most likely get more subscribers onto that paid newsletter and make more money.\
\
Jessie Festa [00:10:26]:\
Also, consider ways to increase your base price of your paid newsletter. Just because you are charging, you know, $11 per month for your newsletter doesn't mean that's all that you can make per subscriber. For example, here is chef Dimalphy who offers her audience a new cookbook every month, and it's $10 per month for the paid subscribers. Now, if you don't want to subscribe to her newsletter, you can also purchase back issues for $15 each. So she sells her back issues as standalone products, which is genius. A few other pricing tips. The larger the impact you make on someone's life, typically the more they're willing to pay. So for me with my newsletter, people subscribing are hopefully the goal is for them to make money.\
\
Jessie Festa [00:11:20]:\
So it's a clear, you know, I'm gonna pay 9.99 a month, but hopefully I'm gonna make much more than that back from the newsletter. It can just make it an easier sell. Also consider offering a discounted annual plan to help increase retention. We'll talk more about this as we go on, but it's just a great way to have people commit to the year instead of every month thinking about, oh, should I stay a paying member or not? You might also offer a free version or a free trial to allow new readers to get to know you, give them a little taste of your work. So I offer, you can see on the right, a 2 week free trial, but you might also have a paid version of your newsletter, and then a sample of that exact newsletter can go to the free subscriber, so they can really see what they're gonna get. You might also include affiliate links where relevant and helpful. Just make sure that you always disclose when you do this, and just really make sure you're only including affiliate links where it truly makes sense and to brands and products that you truly love and think your audience would love. Now building on this idea of affiliate marketing in the newsletter, consider having a footer or a link to a resource list with recommended resources using affiliate links.\
\
Jessie Festa [00:12:33]:\
For me, I have it's jessieonajourney.com/tools. It's my recommended tools and resources for bloggers. I share this with everyone, whether you join one of my courses, my paid newsletter, my free newsletter. In the welcome email, I'm sharing that link. Okay. Moving on to step 3, you wanna choose your tech. So I have a few options here. Option 1, maybe you use your current email marketing platform, and you just have a PayPal button and a specified group in your email marketing system.\
\
Jessie Festa [00:13:05]:\
This is what I do. So I have my VIP opportunities newsletter group, and they pay with the PayPal button on my sales page. So for this, your fees include the PayPal fees and your email marketing platform fees, though you can also choose a free platform, or you can use a built in payment button within your own email marketing clients. So for example, if you use, let's say, MailerLite Classic, it's $10 per month for a Sites Pro add on, which you'll have to purchase to use their built in buttons, and then you would just pay Stripe fees, and they do have a free plan for up to 12,000 monthly emails, or maybe you use Convertkit. For that, you'll pay a 3.5% plus 30\'a2 processing fee per transaction, and they have a free plan for up to 1,000 subscribers. Now your other option is to use a service like Substack, very popular for paid newsletters. That is free, but once you start charging your subscribers, they take 10% in addition to credit card transaction fees. Substack is also easy to use and doesn't require a website.\
\
Jessie Festa [00:14:14]:\
They help kind of set up that that website set up for you. As you can see on the right there, going back to from the desk of Alicia Kennedy, she has a Substack site where they're really prompting people to join that paid newsletter. It's also great for writing, but it is not necessarily great for your email marketing strategies like sales funnels and automations. Substack also has a number of tools that can make it easy to grow your paid newsletter, like recommendations for you and other Substack creators can recommend each other. There's cross posting on Substack and subscriber referrals where you can reward your subscribers for bringing you new paid newsletter subscribers. Okay. Moving on to step 4, marketing your newsletter. For many, this can be the trickiest part, but to start you want to create a sales page or a form that creates excitement and sets expectations.\
\
Jessie Festa [00:15:09]:\
What do people get, how often, and why is it beneficial? And I love this example from grants for creators in their why subscribe paragraph. Grants for creators is a monthly newsletter curating grants and other funding opportunities for creators, founders, and small business owners. Grants featured are US based only, really setting those expectations. While free subscribers access a handful of featured grants monthly, paid subscribers get access to our full newsletter with a 100 plus awards and additional playlists we create for disabled persons, podcasters, filmmakers, journalists, and more. Now once you have this set up, you want to make sure to promote this sales page or form everywhere. Some ideas in your website's main menu or in a banner at the top, your link in bio on social media, also in your social media content, in your email signature or in ads, maybe you do promoted pins or Facebook ads or Instagram ads. You might also cross promote with others in your niche. Also, automation sequences sent to your subscribers and customers, and as part of your regular content plan across your digital touch points, think about everywhere that you're creating content, your blog, your free email newsletter, YouTube, social media.\
\
Jessie Festa [00:16:29]:\
Maybe you again have products for your email and customers. Make sure everyone knows about your paid newsletter and why it is so great. Now here's an idea, position your paid newsletter as a logical next step to viewing your content like in your free newsletters. So going back to grants for creators, they have a limited free newsletter where they send a few grants, but it's not the full library of grants that they offer, but they give people a taste of what the paid newsletter will provide. The way I do this, you can see in the screenshot on the left is I will share strategies and then have a call to action to the paid newsletter. So this email was which affiliate program is the best one for travel bloggers, and then the PS of that email, want help finding high paying affiliate programs and other paid opportunities, join my VIP opportunities newsletter, and, hey, it has a 2 week free trial. On the right here, Ashley gets around, sent an email where she accidentally shared what would usually be a premium deal for her paid newsletter subscribers with her free newsletter subscribers. So again, giving them a taste of what they could expect, and then she has the button call to action, join premium here.\
\
Jessie Festa [00:17:44]:\
Just a few marketing ideas for you there. And finally, we are on step number 5, work to retain subscribers. It's not just about getting new paid subscribers into your newsletter, but you want to keep the ones who have already said that they wanted this content. According to Convertkit, the churn rate that you want to aim for is 4% or below. If you're higher than that, it's an indication that you're gonna wanna look at your newsletter content and think about where there might be a disconnect, where people might not be getting what they thought they wanted, or maybe the value just isn't there, and you're gonna need to tweak some things. To help figure these disconnects out and just make the newsletter as amazing as it can be, ask for feedback from your subscribers and actually implement it, and pay attention to what emails and links are getting read and clicked, or what other important actions people are taking or not taking. For example, Alicia Kennedy, we've talked about her a few times, started out by sharing interviews, then switched to recipes based on what her subscribers wanted as well as her long term goals. I learned that by reading an interview with her that she has on her website.\
\
Jessie Festa [00:19:04]:\
Finally, offer incentives to your subscribers to encourage them to stay a member such as a discounted annual plan, and this screenshot is from Alicia Kennedy's own paid newsletter. This way people are committing to the year versus every month kind of thinking about if they want to stay a member. Alright, now I hope you enjoyed this workshop. Before we go, I do have a free gift for you. It is a free resource library for bloggers and content creators. It has 55 plus resources, workshops, workbooks, cheat sheets, tutorials, all meant to help you grow your traffic community and income, and I have created a workbook to pair with this workshop, so make sure to grab that. I've also got an email marketing workbook that's going to help you grow and nurture your email list. If you're still trying to understand your audience, I have a fun defining your audience Mad Libs sheets.\
\
Jessie Festa [00:19:55]:\
I have a content creation and promotion Trello board, all kinds of resources in there just meant to help you grow. So you can scan that QR code or go to jessieonajourney.com/free-blogging-principles, and here's that QR code again, And I just wanna share where we can connect further. My email is jessie@jessieonajourney.com if you have any questions. I also have loads of different blogging freebies@jessieonajourney.com/blogging-freebies. My podcast is the profitable travel blogger podcast where I share short and sweet tutorials, again, meant to help you grow your traffic community and income. I share additional strategies with visuals on the make money travel blogging with jessie on a journey YouTube channel. If you are a travel creator, I have the travel creator community Facebook group, and I'm basically Jesse on a journey on all the social media channels. So again, I hope you found this helpful, and I look forward to connecting with you further.\

\
[00:00:44.710] - Kate Danielle\
I well, thank you so much for having me. It's always a pleasure to join you for this summit.\
\
[00:00:50.150] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
Yeah. So we're going to be talking about creating a product line in Canva because I know obviously lots of bloggers, not only business owners, use Canva for blog graphics and mockups, but you're talking about actually creating a product line. So can you walk us through that distinction and what you're talking about when you say a product line in Canva?\
\
[00:01:09.390] - Kate Danielle\
So basically, it's just to think about a line of tools, products that your audience needs or wants, based on whatever your niche is. And the beauty of it is you can use Canva to set up a variety of products. So whether you're creating a variety of planners or you blog or talk about one specific topic, maybe cooking, you could create a variety of tools like a cookbook or a meal planner guide and recipe cards. And it's just endless of the different things that you could create as long as it's a printable type or it could even be in a presentation, e-book type thing. You can really get creative with different products you can create in Canva.\
\
[00:02:16.170] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
Okay, so we're going to dive more in to how to do that. Before we do, though, because I think it's just as important to know what to avoid, when someone is designing products, what are some common mistakes that they should try to avoid?\
\
[00:02:29.980] - Kate Danielle\
So one of the biggest things to think about is how your end user, how your user is going to want to use the product, because you need to think about, is this something that I want to print? So do you need to go not so heavy on design? Or is this a product? Some people want planners that have a certain esthetic look, so they don't care necessarily how much ink it's going to take. So you really got to think about how it's going to be presented. Maybe it's only going to be viewed on a computer or a tablet, and then you can go crazy with images and colors and get really creative and use links. But you really got to think about the end experience first.\
\
[00:03:15.450] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
Yeah. So who are you creating the product for and what are they going to want? Okay, so can you walk us through a basic Canva workflow for creating a digital product, whether that's, like you said, a planner or cookbook recipe, whatever. Just what is that? How do you get started? How do you get it organized so that you can find it when you need to deliver it? Just walk us through that.\
\
[00:03:41.420] - Kate Danielle\
I would start first brainstorm, have it out, have your idea outlined. If it's going to be very content-heavy, I don't always do this myself, but I suggest you have the content ready to go, because otherwise you're going to get in Canva and you're going to So you're creating content, editing content, and trying to design all at the same time, and it is going to make you crazy. So have your content or an outline. If it's like a planner, sometimes you just got to outline the different aspects that you need to create and what different pages you want to create, whether you're having a yearly overview section, a goal planning section in each month. And then once you have the grasp of what you're going to set out to create, go into Canva. And I like to start with getting some staple elements done. So maybe you're going to have the same header and footer across all the pages, or you're going to have an e-book where you're going to have title pages. Go ahead and get these initial designs set up so that you can just copy that page and reuse it, and copy that page and reuse it.\
\
[00:05:02.860] - Kate Danielle\
So think about you're building a design. I was going to say a structure, but it's a design. So you're starting with your blueprint, and then you're going to go in and make your template, even though your template is going to be part of your design. And then you're going to rinse and repeat the pages, use design elements over and over. I would go up into Canva at the very top. There's going to be a name, the name it, it's just like, Canva populates if you don't rename it. So name it something you're going to remember to search for later, because I can tell you from experience, if you just keep letting Canva autopopulate your titles, it'll be a big mess years later. So maybe do that first. Open your design, name it whatever you name it, because otherwise it's going to name it something based off the first text you put in, a template you put in something. It will pull something and it will make no sense to your business.\
\
[00:06:07.100] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
It's like the first thing you type in there, which might not actually end up being something that stays. Maybe it's a placeholder or something like that. And then you're like, what? Yeah, no. And we do have a session on organizing Canva in the summit. So you guys are like, I'm not sure about Navy conventions or how to organize. We do have another session on that. I was just like, since I know Kate creates so much in Canva, I wanted to get her two cents on that. I like having those elements that you're going to use to be able to just pull them. Have you ever felt, I don't know, limited by Canva's features? Is there any advanced design tips that you've had to figure out that would be helpful and save people having to figure it out on their own that you want to share?\
\
[00:06:55.620] - Kate Danielle\
Honestly, it's going to depend on what you're trying to create. I feel limited in Canva. I have Canva Pro, so I do get feel limited when I try to make maybe a template for someone, like a printable product template, and I'm trying to only use free elements, free features. So there's definitely, you're going to find more fonts, more graphics, and more tools in in the pro version. So that is because sometimes I can be really specific on what graphic I'm trying to find, and there's just not as many in the free version. Now, if you never have pro, you don't know what's out there. So it may not bother you because you haven't seen something else that you would prefer to use, but that it's a Canva Pro element only. But I think as far as creating products in general in Canva, yeah, I think it's all there. Sometimes more makes things harder, and they're always improving and making new additions. But I think it's really good and how streamlined they have kept it over the years.\
\
[00:08:23.900] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
What are the features you're using most when you're creating in Canva? Any shortcuts? What are you using? I feel pretty sure that'll be easier.\
\
[00:08:34.820] - Kate Danielle\
Okay. I do use tons of keyboard shortcuts, which I talk about all the time. T for text, and I'll go ahead and share my screen because I can show where... I think this is the first time I've used Zoom on this computer, so I'm heading all the roadblocks today.\
\
[00:08:55.600] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
Here we go. I can always edit this part.\
\
[00:08:58.310] - Kate Danielle\
See if it's going to Let me... Okay. In Canva, I'm always using keyboard shortcuts, T for text or drop in a text box, R for... No, can't be active in the text box. R for rectangle, drop in a shape. I typically do that for whatever shape because then you can just come up here and pick it. But I always tell people to come down here to the little question mark and ask Canva, type in shortcuts, and of course, this is all updated. I'm just going to just populate it, some of the most basic shortcuts. And now you can ask it for specific ones, but these are going to be like Control Z, Undo. You don't typically need save a lot when I do use, this is going to force save it, which means, you know, Canva is always saving in the background. And it's a very rare that I have a canva glitch. But if you see, you'll see if I can get my And then just working super speed.\
\
[00:10:17.390] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
Yeah, it'll see.\
\
[00:10:18.260] - Kate Danielle\
Sometimes, yeah. And if you ever see this get stuck or you don't have your little checkmark, you need to try to force save with the control Z, I mean, control S or come up here somewhere in here. Yeah, there's a save because that is your first tip that something is glitching. I feel like this hasn't happened to me in years.\
\
[00:10:41.720] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
It's pretty rare, but sometimes it's just from your internet connection. It's not even necessarily Canva.\
\
[00:10:47.260] - Kate Danielle\
True. The other thing, so shortcuts, they really will. It seems like it won't save a lot of time, but they save you so much time versus coming over here, adding a text box, you will speed up your workflow. The other thing that I use a lot, one of my favorite things, and I believe it has moved a little bit with the glow up that I think everybody has now. Let me just find an element. I love to see more things like this. If I have an element I like and maybe I want to try to find more things in that style. There used to be a little I button.\
\
[00:11:36.630] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
Well, it's down here at the bottom of the... Yeah.\
\
[00:11:40.360] - Kate Danielle\
At the menu, yeah. You can click on your three dots I'm going to come down here and click Info, and it's going to give you all the keywords for it, which these are all clickable, and it'll bring up more. You can also do it right in here within the elements window. I can click the three dots and say see more like this. It's just a good way to really utilize what Canva has to offer when you're making a cohesive design. I'm trying to think. I'm sure there are tons of other things. Sure. When you have time, explore the apps library, there's always cool things popping up in there. But I would say save that for when you are not in the middle of a project because you can go down a rabbit hole.\
\
[00:12:39.820] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
You absolutely can. Definitely been guilty of that. And then if you open an app and you find you're not using it, make sure you're exiting it out of your sidebar.\
\
[00:12:50.810] - Kate Danielle\
Yes, because I probably have tons of things open. Your file folder stay open if you're on Canva Pro and have lots of folders. So it is a good idea. And you just come in and click it because these stay open window to from project to project. And you can get over and messy down there.\
\
[00:13:12.350] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
Okay, do you have any strategies or tips to help people make their design seem more polished, more professional? I mean, Canva is an incredible tool, but I've definitely seen some subpar designs that people have made in it. Any things that make it stand out as being more professional and polished?\
\
[00:13:33.640] - Kate Danielle\
Yes. One of the biggest things I see, always pay attention to your text alignment and your page alignment. Let me just open up. I got Let me just get the square open, but let's go, or this is fine. We can stick with a square, but typically, if you're making a printable product, it's going to be a US letter size. But one of the biggest things, so you'll notice, I popped in a text box It is automatically set the alignment to center. It's on center. So I've seen in the past where people are trying to make a list, and as you change the words here, you're going to see that things are all centered and people will come and try to maybe line stuff up like this. And this one actually looked pretty clean because the text box is growing with the text, but it'll get So one of the biggest things is, most cases, you're going to want your text aligned to the left. So go ahead and do that. It makes it nice for when you come up and use the position tool, which is another way to really make things polish. You're going to want to make sure, again, if you've got multiple elements, multiple text boxes that need to be in line with one another, you have these options.\
\
[00:14:56.810] - Kate Danielle\
This one's grayed out because they're already aligned. Maybe for whatever reason, I need it centered. You can also space evenly, vertically, and horizontally. These are key. And also tidy up. These are really going to help you just make sure your design is cleaned up. You can also turn on your rollers. If you come up to file, or maybe it's an under-editing now. No. File.\
\
[00:15:27.960] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
I think it's under settings.\
\
[00:15:29.790] - Kate Danielle\
I'll show guides and Rulers. Let's close our position window and see these have popped up. And now I can actually drag in guides. So maybe you're designing something and you don't want to use the Canva pre-populated box that pops up. You want something set here. And if I had another page, those guides are going to be there. Your ruler measurement is going to be whatever... I got to go away. Whatever you open your design in. So right now it's in pixels. But if I were to say I want a US letter size or even type in custom size and change it to inches, my ruler is then going to be in inches. So depending on what you're making, that'll help you. So now my ruler is in inches. And if I can zoom in, it zooms with me. So that's really helpful. And don't be afraid of white space. White space in your design just allows things to read. It makes it more easy for your customer to consume it and read it. So take a step back and see if there's anything that you need to clean up or take away from the design to make it a little more polished.\
\
[00:17:00.030] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
Okay, so we touched on this, but Canva has obviously been updating. I was like, not necessarily changing. They've moved things, it's updating, but they've definitely released some new features. Are some of them helping you to really create products faster or just make life easier or they've just enhanced that process?\
\
[00:17:23.400] - Kate Danielle\
So right now, I feel like it's just been enhanced a little bit there, which anytime there's a major glow up, you can see me. I've been going through a move. So since my Canva went through its glow up because I held off for a little while, you can see me feeling around for things. So it takes a little bit of time to be like, Oh, where's that tool I used to use? But it's there. There are some things coming. They did an October drop, but it was more or less like polishing up some things that I think have been around. I think they're really focusing on maybe improving AI, which that can help. Canva does have the AI writer. So let's see if you hit the backslash on your keyboard, you can get magic, right? So this could help you brainstorm ideas, come up with maybe a headline for whatever you're on, things like that. So I only see these features getting better and better because just some full transparency for AI needs. Currently, I use other tools like ChatGPT and other things, but I see Canva to continue to improve, and they are going to be making their mockups better.\
\
[00:18:58.390] - Kate Danielle\
It may even be out at the time that you're watching this. But right now, if you don't know, because if you're making products, you're going to want to create good mockups of them. And so let's just see if I can find in my uploads. Working on Halloween stuff. We'll just pretend this is a worksheet or something I've designed. If you come up to Edit, you can come down to mockups and you can find different... You can find tablets, computers. There's a print one in here. Click See All. Find something you need. But There is an update coming where I believe you're going to be able to use images from the Canva library. Because if you look in the library right now, there will be things that look like it should be a mockup. Helps if I spell correctly. Which you could use these frames, those work for mockups. But if we come over to photos, sometimes you get something like this. Currently, at the time of the recording, there's no way for me to insert something at that perspective here in Canva. But I do think that it is going to be improved in the near future.\
\
[00:20:33.210] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
Yeah, I'm excited to see that. Okay, so once you've created your product in Canva, are you selling a Canva link? Are you selling a PDF? I mean, there's a ton. We'll go over checkout software. I don't know if you're a particular fan of recommending an Etsy or anything like that if you're doing a product line. But what exactly are you selling to give... What's the deliverable?\
\
[00:20:59.100] - Kate Danielle\
So it's really going to depend on your product because I didn't really mention it, but what I do a lot is sell templates. So that definitely could be your product line or you could be making like we've talked about, like a planner. So if it is like a planner, an e-book, something that you're going to download and deliver, you're going to want to download that as a PDF, which you can come here, click Download, and click I don't have anything on my screen. Let's do it again. Canva is They're like, There's nothing there. You're going to click PDF. If you have... Well, again, the way the user is going to use it in the end is going to matter. If this is something you foresee that the majority of people are only going to use on a computer, you could do PDF standard. If they're going to print it, you have PDF print and you can click over to CMYK. If you have If you have a pro that's just going to help it print better even at home, those are just small details. If your product is really big, you may need to, even though it's a PDF, create a PDF link page.\
\
[00:22:16.040] - Kate Danielle\
A lot of times you'll see this on Etsy. And so in that case, you're just going to design a pretty PDF all in your branding. You're going to thank them for their purchase. You may have an offer or more info, and then you're going to have a big button that says, Click here to get your product. And in that case, your PDF or your files will be stored somewhere. A lot of people use Dropbox, Amazon, some Google Drive, and somewhere where they can access a zipped folder of that. Now, if you're doing templates, I would do the same thing. You're going to create a pretty PDF with a link to your template, but you're going to come in Canva, click Template Link. And again, these prepopulate based off what you've been using. So if you ever don't see anything, you can click on See All, and then you can search. You're going to choose Template Link, create a template, and this is what you're going to copy and then put on your nice pretty PDF. So if I make a little button, I tend to do a rectangle, make a button shape, add very plainly like click here.\
\
[00:23:36.200] - Kate Danielle\
You may want instructions of what's going to happen, and then you can link this entire shape with your template link, and it will open up the whole set. So that's how I would share those. And came about recently, so now you can see my template is Live. And they recently updated this. If you're familiar with selling templates, they sent us an email that was scary. It was like, your links aren't going to work. And then it was really like a five, second, fix. So I haven't dug too much into it after I fixed mine, but I think you can actually go view. Maybe not. View where people are clicking it. I I could have made that up. They did something with the link, but you can share it. You do have to have Canva Pro to share template links this way. And if you're selling templates, you should be doing it this way. Versus otherwise, you're just sharing a design, and if somebody makes a change, it changes it on everyone's.\
\
[00:24:53.200] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
Okay. Do you happen to have, I think I might have one I'm looking, an example of what that pretty product PDF links page looks like?\
\
[00:25:05.860] - Kate Danielle\
Yeah, I'm sure I do. Let's see.\
\
[00:25:08.530] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
I have one somewhere, but do I know where it's at right at the second? I'm not seeing it where I think it should be at? That's probably more. Oh, here's one. I didn't do this in Canva, but it's maybe a little bit... Let me share my screen. Just to give an example since I found mine first.\
\
[00:25:30.730] - Kate Danielle\
Oh, yeah. Go for it. Do I need to stop?\
\
[00:25:33.040] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
No, I think I got it. Sure. All right. So this is a PDF. So is that on par with what you're talking about? I mean, this isn't super nice. It's just one link, but similar idea.\
\
[00:25:54.830] - Kate Danielle\
Yeah, just like that. I think that's another good idea, especially if you're doing something it like having the policies, especially if it is something like templates, share how they're the rules on how the terms. That's a great idea and a great idea, a great marketing place as well. But be sure that that's not taking over. Remember, if they bought something that needs to be front and center, you can also have part of your wine could be freebies, and then you're really going to want to utilize the space if you were offering something for free. Yeah.\
\
[00:26:34.360] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
All right. I'm going to stop sharing. Yeah, I was like, just to give an example, because I feel like we're talking about it in the abstract, and it's always helpful to see an example. Okay, so once you've created it, you know how you're going to deliver it, what are your tips for promoting your Canva created product line to reach the right fit to actually make sales?\
\
[00:26:59.100] - Kate Danielle\
So So it depends on your goals. I'm a big fan in setting up little small funnels. So maybe if you're blogging and you have your site, maybe you have a freebie that leads into your products. So you can, one, start building an email list because that way, any time you create a new product, you can market it towards that list. That is what I tend to utilize the most So you're getting people in on a free offer or a little sample and go ahead and on the thank you page be making them an offer to a small product, a tripwire. But also then you're creating this audience, even if they don't make a purchase right then, that you can market to via email. If you are wanting to get into an entire line, like you're wanting to make a style of planners or activity sheets or something that you want to make a bunch of. I think it's the right options to get started. That's not to say you can also sell on your own site, but Etsy already has the the market. Because I know there's a lot of back and forth on whether it's worth it or not, but especially with digital products.\
\
[00:28:23.360] - Kate Danielle\
Just like how you probably... A lot of people go to Amazon, they shop on Amazon first before they think to Google anywhere else. People do that with Etsy with digital products like printables, especially creative printables. If it's more of an info-based, like e-book type of thing, you're going to want to probably stick more towards the funnel, building your audience through an email list. And you can do the same. You can build an email list via Etsy, but it's going to be more like planners, activity sheets, things like that.\
\
[00:29:04.000] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
So again, it's knowing who you're making the products for is really going to help you determine where and how you're going to sell them.\
\
[00:29:10.610] - Kate Danielle\
All right.\
\
[00:29:12.470] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
Anything else people should know about or that we haven't covered that you want to make sure they know?\
\
[00:29:18.790] - Kate Danielle\
I would say, don't be scared to create products with Canva. I get a lot of questions about... And you have You have a lot of information on this, right? About what you are allowed and not allowed to do with Canva elements. Don't be scared. Canva has come forward. They've made it more clear of what you can do. You are allowed to use free and pro elements in your designs as long as you are using that to create your own thing, as long as you're taking I have a couple of them combining it to create your own planner design.\
\
[00:30:05.640] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
Yeah. Don't just take one element and that's it.\
\
[00:30:09.960] - Kate Danielle\
Right. You can't make a poster of a bear you found in the Canva library. You got to combine elements together. People question, How much is a unique design? That is going to be up to your discretion. I don't have the link for me. I can find it, but they have a great page that has a lot of use cases scenarios. And I think Canva as a whole, in the past five years, their team is more clear. And it used to seem like if you had a question and you hit help and ask Canva, you might get different answers from them versus from an employee in one of their groups. I think they've got all that settled. Also, I've not seen this be an issue. I've not I've seen everyone get all up in arms like, oh, oh, my gosh, the terms are changing. I haven't yet to see Canva going after someone creating a printable product. They will go after you if you take a photo, one photo from their library and try to sell it as a poster. But as long as you're trying to do right, they want you to be able to use their platform.\
\
[00:31:25.680] - Kate Danielle\
So don't be scared. I'm not a lawyer, but I have done a I've done lots of research. I've talked with staff. There's been lots of conversations. So it is there for you to use and to make things with.\
\
[00:31:41.650] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
I actually have an article on what you can use in terms of Canva commercially. I'll try to remember to add that link to this page. I think you have something for everyone, where they can find you, all those things.\
\
[00:31:57.160] - Kate Danielle\
I do. I have a free guide. It has over 60 printable product ideas that you can use for opt-ins or products. So to grow your list and make money. You can get that at katedanielle.Com/ideas or there's a longer link that Liz has. It'll be posted somewhere.\
\
[00:32:19.990] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
Yes, that will definitely be on the page.\
\
[00:32:22.660] - Kate Danielle\
But yeah, it'll help brainstorm. There's some info on there to help you generate ideas. Because I think you got to think about what your audience would be after. But also it's got to excite you, too. You got to have that happy medium of what is something your audience is going to want and need and something that you're excited to create and market. So I got a guide with lots of ideas to help you brainstorm and start creating your product line.\
\
[00:32:54.180] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
All right, perfect. Definitely go check that out, you guys. Kate, again, thank you so much for coming back and sharing your knowledge. I always learned something new. I definitely did today as well. So thank you again.\
\
[00:33:04.390] - Kate Danielle\
Thank you so much.\

[00:00:00.000] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
All right, guys. I'm thrilled today to have Katie here talking about course creation. Katie, thank you so much for doing this on me. I appreciate it.\
\
[00:00:08.990] - Katie Hornor\
You're so welcome. I'm super happy to be here.\
\
[00:00:11.890] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
Yeah. You're going to be talking about, I think it's blueprint to course creation or something. Can you give us the highlights of what you're going to be covering in your session?\
\
[00:00:23.130] - Katie Hornor\
All right. So my background is that I have a master's in teaching and curriculum development. I go into course creation a little bit different than other folks. We've created 25 some courses online in the last couple of years. But we're really looking at how do we create a content that is going to push people through to get that transformation step by step so that our marketing is less work because our people got the transformation and they're super excited about it. So we're going to be talking about rubrics. We're going to be talking about your student experience, just a whole lot of things that a lot of those other quick and easy, create your course and get it out there today things don't go into.\
\
[00:01:04.590] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
Yeah, they cover like, okay, these are the steps you need to take to create your course and to launch it. But this is diving deep more into how you structure the content, it sounds like. Exactly. So both important, but just a little different.\
\
[00:01:18.400] - Katie Hornor\
Right. It's a different take on things and something that is easy to overlook, but can be really key for a good experience for your students.\
\
[00:01:26.150] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
Exactly. All right. So let's go ahead and dive in.\
\
[00:01:31.770] - Katie Hornor\
Hey, it's Katie Hornor, and I am thrilled to be coming to you on this summit today to talk about the Course Creation Blueprint and how you can go deep into your curriculum to create an amazing experience for the students of your course. So hang tight today. You'll need the notes. Download below because we're going to go through some things pretty quickly, and you'll want to take notes on some others. So if you don't have it, go get that download sheet at KatieHornor.Com/summit or at the link below this video. Be sure that you have that as we get ready to delve into the material today. Okay, so just as a matter of introduction, if we are meeting here for the first time, again, my name is Katie Hornor, and I am the founder of handprintlegacy.Com and Lemonhaus.com. And I'm the creator of over 24 online courses, including successful online courses, which is the reason that you are here today. Successful online courses is our premium flagship program that we are super proud of. It is helping business owners, coaches, and practitioners in all kinds of niches create premium online courses. You know, whether you end up learning how to create your course from me or from somebody else, you need to know what to look for in an expert instructor, correct?\
\
[00:02:47.680] - Katie Hornor\
You always want to learn from an expert. You want to learn from someone who has had the head knowledge and the life experience, who has been through the trainings and the processes, who has put in the time and done this themselves and have something to show for it. In terms of our qualifications, let me just share that in our business, my husband and I, and here's a picture of our family, I have a master's degree in education and curriculum development. We have created a complete eight-grade level homeschool curriculum in another language. Lemonhaus is our Spanish language business that supports the Spanish homeschool community around the world. So we have created more than We've had 24 online courses in the history of our business, and we've had over 6,000 students, almost 7,000 students go through our online courses just in the last three years. So I'm not just telling you some stuff that you can use to throw together and make some money quick here. My goal, my heart in this is to help you get your course, your premium course, created so that it can be an asset for your business. I want to see you create something that will help you package your genius in such a way that you can transfer your genius to other people and create a legacy by doing so.\
\
[00:04:06.300] - Katie Hornor\
An asset that can outlive you in your business and continue to teach that genius that you have to future generations. So I'm going to give you our step-by-step system via this course creation cheat sheet and the information in this webinar. If you got the course creation cheat sheet, which I hope you did when you signed up for this webinar, we're going to walk you through all of those pieces that are in teal on that resource. You'll see those teal boxes around certain content. That's what we're covering here in this first part today. If you don't have the cheat sheet, please click on the button below and download it because we're going to be walking through all of those particular parts of this resource. How is this going to change your life? Well, I know how it's changed my life. I know how it's helped us earn income, how it's helped us have a bigger impact, and helped our students have a bigger impact. I'm going to be telling you more about that in a second. But before we go any further, I want you to know that I am committed to playing full out in the next hour of this training, and I want to ask you to play full out, too.\
\
[00:05:12.130] - Katie Hornor\
This is information that can change your life, but you have got to be willing to pay attention. And maybe you've already heard some of this before. I don't want you to just discard what I'm saying because you think, Oh, I've heard that before. You may have. You may be doing some of the things already that I'm going to be talking about, but I want you to keep an open mind, and I want you to look at the information that I'm presenting and ask yourself, How can I apply this to my business? Even if it's not completely new, is there a new way to look at it? How could I take something that He's teaching me here and put it into practice to up my game, to make a bigger impact, to increase the income that we already have coming in, to increase our time freedom, to increase the impact, the change that we're able to make in the world. I'm going to do everything I can to maximize the value that you get from our limited time here together. And I'm going to promise you that I will show you how you can learn more.\
\
[00:06:09.880] - Katie Hornor\
This is not a challenge. This is an opportunity for you to multiply your income and to multiply your legacy impact. Back in early elementary math, when you learn that two plus two is four, well, that was one level. But man, when you got up to where you were learning 10 times 10, now Now you're on a new level. And that's why I'm taking you tonight. We're looking at the multiplication phase of course creation. We're not looking at course creation as a challenge. We're not looking at it on the first level. We're not looking at course creation as a get-rich-quick thing either. I don't want you thinking you can just get-rich-quick overnight with this. But we're looking at course creation from the perspective that this is an opportunity for you to multiply your time freedom and multiply your income and your impact. It's so important when you think about the impact side of what a difference this can make in your lifetime and beyond it. I've been teaching for over two decades. I've got a master's degree in education. I've spent time teaching in public schools and Christian schools, in ministry settings, in secular settings. I've been a speaker on international conference stages for the past six years.\
\
[00:07:25.030] - Katie Hornor\
We created a full homeschool curriculum over at Lemonhaas.Com. We've and online conferences. And there's one thing that I want to tell you that if you're looking for something that's going to make you an overnight success story, it's not courses. But if you're looking for something that's going to give you an opportunity to make a legacy impact that spans generation while giving you time, freedom, and more income, it is definitely courses. Teaching has been around as long as the Earth has existed. I mean, we We pass everything down by way of teaching. Everything that we learn, we learn from someone else teaching in some way. Some people today still focus on throwing courses together quickly so you can get it out there and make more money. That's not what I'm teaching here. My heart is to focus on the quality of what you're putting out there so that the quality of the curriculum that you create and the quality of the student experience that you give your people will allow them to learn what you give them in a way that you can get them all the way to the transformation through the application to the transformation of that thing that your genius teaches.\
\
[00:08:40.590] - Katie Hornor\
You want them to take full ownership of the genius that you are passing on to them. I mean, if something happened to you tomorrow, I'm not saying it will, please don't misunderstand that, but think about what would happen in your business? What would happen to your family if something happened to you tomorrow? If you were incapacitated, if you If you could no longer participate in your business, if you could no longer teach one-to-one or real-life classes the way you do now, who would continue to teach those things that you know? Who would continue to do those one-on-ones that you're spending so much of your work time doing? If you're not training someone else to do it, if you're not preserving your genius in some way that it can be taught without you present, your business is not going to survive without you. And so this is not just an asset for your business. It also becomes a tool by which you can take yourself out of your business. You can start to remove yourself from your business even now and allow your business the strength and the capability of surviving without you or surviving beyond you, if that were to be the case.\
\
[00:09:50.200] - Katie Hornor\
So you see how this changes everything? You see how having a premium online course is better than the old way of just doing what we know until we're done? Do you see how courses give you a vision that will allow you to have an impact into the future? Are you ready to learn how to create that premium online course? So a lot of us struggle with either money or making an impact. And I know because I've been there. When we first started our business way back in the early years, 2010, 2012-ish, every day was a big struggle. One of our biggest struggles was finances, but the other one was the fact that we felt so compelled to make a bigger impact, and we just weren't growing fast enough to be able to see that impact happen as quickly as we wanted it to. When we started our business, my husband and I were in Mexico with four kids. A ministry opportunity that we had sold all of our belongings in order to move to Southern Mexico and spend the rest of our lives doing had just been pulled out from under our feet. When that happened, the financial support that we had been promised went away as well.\
\
[00:11:01.500] - Katie Hornor\
We didn't have enough money in the bank to even get back to the US if we wanted to. And at that point, we really didn't want to because by that time, we had fallen in love with Mexico so much. We wanted to stay. We wanted to find a way to support ourselves so that we could stay and continue to do what we love doing and serving the Spanish-speaking people. But we had to be able to come up with a business that would allow us to do this. And so when we realized that there was a need in the homeschool community that we could fill, we started putting together that homeschool curriculum in Spanish that would serve these people. And then later, this became online courses to support first-time homeschool parents. And now we have an annual online summit, which It was the first in history online summit for Spanish-speaking homeschool parents. When we started, I remember specifically saying to my husband, When we get to the point that this is earning money for us, I want to be able to teach other people how to do this, I want to teach them how they can bring an income for their family, how they can make a bigger impact than they dreamed of with the genius that they have.\
\
[00:12:08.680] - Katie Hornor\
And that's where we are today. That's what has happened for us over these last few years of all that trial and error and struggle that we went through to bootstrap this business and build it up on our own. All of our mistakes are now there to guide and help others progress faster and easier to their goals of impact and increased income. So you can learn from the mistakes that we made, and you can learn from the thousands of dollars that we spent through the years in training. You can learn from our educational training and experience. And so I'm going to show you how to start with these five strategies in the cheat sheet, and in the end, how to go on and impact 6,000 and 7,000 and tens of thousands more with your genius in the next three years, just like we have. And what I'm teaching you today is coming right out of that program, successful online courses. Okay, so if you have your course creation cheat sheet, and again, if you don't, please download it below the video, the course creation cheat sheet, we're going to be looking at step two, which is planning your course content.\
\
[00:13:15.070] - Katie Hornor\
Like I said, this is my area of expertise. This is what I went to school for. This is what I got a master's degree in. This is what I have lived and breathed for the past 20 some years. This is something I use every single day. And so first of all, when you're creating your course content, you've got to be able to decide how many modules it's going to take to build your course. How many modules are you going to put into this? How many sections of course content? Which basically means how many steps are there to get your students from where they are now to that transformation that they want. So I recommend three to five modules that you can put into your course. And we use odd numbers just because that seems to psychologically do better, right? But three Three to five modules, and you can make your notes right there in the cheat sheet. How many modules do you need to have? Think about what it is that you're teaching. How many steps, how many big steps are there to get your people from where they are now to where they need to be?\
\
[00:14:13.910] - Katie Hornor\
So whether that's three or four or five, you're going to break each one of those steps into smaller steps or lessons within that module. So think of the lessons like micro steps that are going to get them to finish that bigger step in the process. So the module is the bigger step, and inside the module are the lessons or the step by step for how to complete that one bigger step in the process. You don't want to have your lessons very long. People like to consume content in shorter pieces, so keep your lessons short, keep them to the point. You don't need to spend a lot of extra time. Just say it, get it done, and go on. But the cheat sheet here on page six This is where you're going to want to note on the cheat sheet on page 6 is where you're going to want to note those ideas for each of those lessons. It's not going to be everything you know. We want to remember simple is superior and think about what is the absolute most necessary information they're going to need to get this done, to finish this big step in the process?\
\
[00:15:23.760] - Katie Hornor\
What are the step-by-step instructions that's going to get them there? Each lesson is a piece of the puzzle that's important them to know as they get this one step done. When they get all the steps or the modules done and you get them to that transformation, then they're at the end of Module 5, they're going to look back and see how easy it was because you were able to break it down into those three or five big steps for them. People don't buy courses because you're going to teach them everything you know about the topic. They're buying your course because they trust that you're going to give them the step-by-step, simple, clear instructions for getting them from where they are now to that desired transformation. You're going to show them how to solve their problem. Within your lessons, you want to think about things like giving them examples or telling stories. You may want to include activities or materials list, depending on what your topic is and what you're teaching. You may want to make notes about those things here on this page because they're going to be important for you to include in your lesson when you're actually writing out your lesson plan and your content outline to teach from.\
\
[00:16:32.860] - Katie Hornor\
Now, when I was in college, we were talking a lot about the word rubric. If you don't know what a rubric is, a very basic definition is that it's like a schema or a table chart, something like that, that lays out very clearly what the student is required to do in order to pass the class, like what the assignment is, how the assignment is evaluated, how many points they're going to get for doing that thing. If you do this, The result will be this. If you do this, the result will be this. This is how you're progressing through this class. And so that's something that you can create for your course and for your modules, for your students in your online course. It's part of one of the most successful keys to a successful course and successfully getting your people through it because now they know what to expect. They know what they need to do or to complete in order to get that result, to finish that step. And so you can also use this as part of a gamification piece, which we go into full detail in in the successful online courses program.\
\
[00:17:33.200] - Katie Hornor\
But gamification is that strategy that will help to move them through your course. It keeps them working towards that final result, that final transformation. And so they're under each module on that page six. You want to plan out each of those step by step lessons for each of those bigger module steps that's going to get your students from A to B, solve the problem that your course is promising to solve. Now, moving on to page 7, the teal section on page seven is where we highlighted the part about recording your lessons. And again, we're going to go much deeper into this than successful online courses, but I didn't feel like the cheat sheet was quite detailed enough to give you the good overview. So for this second strategy, let me just go through this with you quickly. When you're recording your lessons, it is so much easier for you as a teacher to create a general outline based based on that step or that transformation that you want your students to achieve in each lesson. You don't have to script the whole thing. Let me say that again. You don't have to script the whole thing.\
\
[00:18:43.690] - Katie Hornor\
We would be here until we were 105 if you had to write out word for word every single thing you plan to say in this course. And so what I have found easier and faster is to create an outline of the points that I want to make. I would note any important I have the information that I absolutely cannot leave out. And then I'll leave a list of resources or whatever in the course, maybe below the video. But I'll just teach from that outlined. Just talk or explain or teach from that outline that I've created of the high points because I know the stuff. You're the expert. You know this content, backwards and forwards and inside and outwards. So just create that outline of the points that are most important for them to and then just talk from your outline, teach from your outline. Because when you are concerned about having to get in every single word or about reading from your script and making it sound normal or those kinds of things become a hindrance to us, a distraction to us as we're teaching. The outline is going to keep you on task. It's going to help you keep on track to be sure that you're not missing any important content, but it's not going to limit you in terms of the perfectionism and and all of that other stuff that can get in the way when you're trying to get those teaching pieces completed.\
\
[00:20:07.080] - Katie Hornor\
Also, in terms of logistics, you want to be careful to always keep your mouth in the same place in relation to your microphone Or if you're using camera, always be sure to face the microphone on the camera, especially when you're doing video. Now, if you're doing audio, then, of course, try to keep your mouth the same distance from the microphone each time that you do it. Try to keep the same amount of energy, like when you're recording a podcast episode. But then if you're doing video, you also want to be concerned about looking at the camera, facing the camera. Make the student feel like they're the only one in the world that you are talking to and really make that connection with them. You also want to minimize distractions that can come in the form of noise in the area when you're recording, or it can come in the form of distractions in your background, especially when you set up your camera. Try to take a picture of what the student is going to be looking at. So the picture from your computer screen or your camera screen towards you and beyond, and look at that picture and see what you have in your background, what's behind you.\
\
[00:21:15.170] - Katie Hornor\
You don't want to have a shirt thrown across the back of the chair somewhere or toys in the middle of the room or a window that's making funny shadows. You just never know what's going to show up in those backgrounds. So be sure that you're double checking your background before before you do those videos. There's all kinds of crazy things that can get into the background and become a distraction. You want to minimize those as much as you can, especially when you're doing the video. All right, now let's move on to page 10. And in On page 10, we're talking about your third strategy, which is your launch plan. Here again, I know there's a lot of people who place the majority of their focus on the marketing piece of course creation. Your launch plan is important for successful online course, but I just want to reiterate that it doesn't matter how well you can market your course if your content that we talked about in the previous section doesn't help them get to the transformation. When you're launching, you want to let your audience know the date that you're going to open your course registrations in advance.\
\
[00:22:18.110] - Katie Hornor\
You want to start talking about it ahead of time. Let them know that this is coming. You want to give them a hint, start building this buzz around the opening of your course. You're going to to create images for sharing on social media. If you've been through our business branding masterclass, then you know that this is a super important key here. You want to be able to create images that are both on point with your brand, but also congruent with each other. This is especially important if you're going to be running ads for your open car or your launch, because platforms like Facebook will be expecting you to have a very similar looking image and wording on the landing page that they go to from Facebook as that particular ad did. And so you want to be sure that you're keeping everything congruant. People are like, Oh, yes, I saw this on Facebook. It's the same thing over here. I know he's talking about the same thing. So keep it congruence so that people are recognizing this no matter what platform they're seeing it on and keep them branded to your course and to each other.\
\
[00:23:25.590] - Katie Hornor\
I know sometimes we like to branch out and do things that are going to attract attention, but But you do still need to keep it congruant in your branding. Then you want to ask folks to opt in to your sales page in advance. You can get your sales page done ahead of time so that you can go ahead and start collecting those emails, put up a waitlist type thing there so that it's there and you can begin to talk about it and people can sign up for notification when you do open your cart. And that way you're already beginning to build your list of people who are interested in this before you're actually ready to open it for them. You'll want to email your list and ask them to opt in to the waitlist. And then once your course is open, you're definitely going to want to email that list again and give them that invitation again to join your course. You can ask friends, you can ask former students or former clients to help you share about the course that this is coming. This could be something just as simple as, Hey, you know what I do.\
\
[00:24:27.030] - Katie Hornor\
You know the impact that it's had on your life. You know how I've helped I would love for you to share this. Would you help me get the word out? Who do you know that needs this course that I'm creating? And many of those people are going to be super happy to help you share about that new course. If you already have a following on social media, of course, enlist their help in sharing it with people they know who need help with that topic. You can submit guests posts to blogs. You can guest on podcasts that are going to air near the times that you're going to launch. And this is especially good strategy. If you've got something free that leads into your waitlist for your course, this is a really good thing because while podcasters are usually a little bit less inclined to just let you sell from their show, if you've got a gift or a freebie that they can offer their people, then that makes them look really good. They're not selling on the show. They're giving things away. And it allows you a chance to invite their audience to become your audience and to get in on your list and sign up for that waitlist.\
\
[00:25:29.520] - Katie Hornor\
Host. And so that's a really good strategy for letting people know about your launch. So think about where you could possibly either guest post on a blog or be a guest on a podcast during this time that you're coming up on your launch period. And then when you do launch, Be sure that you're going back to those people, to the blog host, to the podcast host, and let them know that you've launched. And maybe something like, Hey, we just opened cart on our course. Would you mind sharing that episode again where you interviewed me and just let people know that the course is now open? And many of them would be happy to share that out again to their audience. You also want to be preparing your launch week emails for when you will open cart. The open cart can be a really busy week when you're answering people's questions and you're doing Facebook Live and trying to get all this other stuff done, take care of customers and their last minute questions and things like that. You definitely want to do as much of the work as you can in advance to try to minimize the stress during that Opencart week.\
\
[00:26:34.770] - Katie Hornor\
So speaking from experience, someone who has done eight different launches in the last nine months, I definitely know what I'm talking about here. OpenCart can be stressful. So please hear me when I say that you want to do as much as you can in advance. As much as possible, get it done in advance, especially when it comes to writing those emails or preparing your social media post, getting your images created, all of that stuff can be done in advance, and that frees you up to be less stressed when you're trying to push out those daily reminders during Open Cart Week. And we have tools that do that. You can pre-schedule emails, you can pre-schedule social media posts. So very easy to get that done in advance and be a little bit ahead of the game. All right. And then the fourth strategy that we're talking about is on page 11, and this is the overdelivery. You want to make your students feel welcomed and wanted and respected. Once you open cart and you have people joining your course, you want to give them an amazing experience right from the beginning. And you want to be sure that they feel welcomed and wanted and respected and seen and heard, you want to be able to call them out and welcome them in.\
\
[00:27:51.420] - Katie Hornor\
You want to congratulate them for taking action, reinforce that they made a good decision. You want to be sure that you're doing everything possible to make them feel welcome and safe in this environment so that they can have optimal learning in your course. So in the Successful Online Courses program, we go into a whole lot more detail about several different strategies that you can put into play here to go over the top in making sure that students of all personalities and learning styles have an amazing experience as a student in your course. You're also going to want to remind them in advance of any live classes or calls that may be involved with your course. You don't want to stop emailing them when your cart closes. You need to continue the conversation, continue the communication. Now you need to let these students know the different ways that you're going to be serving them by continuing to keep them up to speed on announcements. If you've got live calls coming up, let them know in advance. When you release a new module, send them a notice. If there's a replay, send them a notice. Keep them up to date with what's going on with your email correspondence.\
\
[00:28:58.780] - Katie Hornor\
And then another Another way to overdeliver is to include games or competitions whenever possible. You want to try to keep their attention. Some people are super competitive, and that little bit of competitiveness is going to go a long way to push them through the content to make it to the end. So make it something that they can enjoy participating in. Other people just really like being entertained, right? They want to enjoy the process, not so much compete, but enjoy what it is that they're doing. And so Do whatever you can to make that an enjoyable experience for them. And then you've got some people who just enjoy the socialization part of sharing with the other people in the same experience. And so you want to be intentional about including different ways that you can overdeliver on this experience and encourage your people to move forward through that content. One of our students just posted this week. She said, I didn't even realize I was stuck yesterday. And in 15 minutes, Katie came in and helped you make a plan and move forward. That's the thing that you want to do for your students. Look for ways that you can help them when maybe they don't even realize that they're stuck to move them forward towards that transformation.\
\
[00:30:13.840] - Katie Hornor\
And then our fifth strategy, and this is not necessarily on your cheat sheet, but it's that when you're presenting your course opportunity to two of your people, they're different. All right? So when you're thinking about this launch and you want to be able to make the application and be sure that you're customizing your language or customizing the transformation to the different people you're trying to reach and their specific needs. I know I gave the example in the For your Success podcast episode 74. We talked about the cake decorators and how one person might be taking the cake decorating course because they have a bakery business and they want to be able to have cakes that sell at higher prices, right? And somebody else may be taking the cake decorating course just because they want to enjoy creating cakes. They want a relaxing hobby that makes them feel like they're creating something beautiful. So you're offering both of those people the same course, but you're going to customize your message according to their desired outcomes in order to help those unique individuals realize that this is the course they need and to give them a better experience as they're going through the course.\
\
[00:31:23.400] - Katie Hornor\
I hope that makes sense. All right. Now, I told you I was also going to debunk several myths that be holding you back from getting started on creating your premium online course. So the first myth, we're going to transition into this now and talk about the first myth. And this is something that I see over and over and over again. People will say something like, Oh, I would love to have a course, but I'm not techy. It's so overwhelming. I don't know how to do all that tech stuff that I need to do to create videos and put information up on a platform and connect it and email. I just don't understand how to do that. I'm going to tell you, you do not have to be techy to have a course. There are so many tools out there that make things super simple. In our successful online courses program, we walk you through step by step, and we help you work through those tech issues so that it is not overwhelming, and it is something that becomes very easy for you to do. We recommend the teachable platform, which, full disclosure here, I am an affiliate for them.\
\
[00:32:32.460] - Katie Hornor\
I think Teachable is the absolute best program out there for beginning course creators and for advanced course creators. I mean, Pat Flynn uses them. And so the Teachable system is very simple and straightforward, and it's just pretty much drag and drop. And yet it looks really good on the student end as well. It gives a really good student experience. And so that's what I recommend. And that's what we walk you through creating your course on. That's the platform that we recommend that you use. So you don't have to be tech savvy as long as you can focus on one step at a time. And we give you all of those steps in order to be able to get your course up there. So the second myth that I see people saying a lot is, Oh, I can't create a course. I'm not good on video. I'm not comfortable on video. Well, let me tell you, video is not the only way to create a course. There are so many different ways to put content out there. Video is one of them, and it is one of the most effective, depending a little bit on your topic of choice, but it's not a have to thing.\
\
[00:33:39.630] - Katie Hornor\
So maybe your people enjoy audio better. You could just create some audio files right from your phone on an audio recorder and use that for your course. I mean, people are learning on audio via podcast every day, right? Successful online courses teaches you about all the different ways that you can deliver your instruction. And in Module One, it actually helps you decide what is What's the best method of delivery of content for you and for your audience? What's the best way for them to consume it? And if you do decide that video is the way to go, we've also included a special lesson for you that teaches you some video tips so that it will help you do that successfully as well. We're going to help you get over that fear if you do indeed decide to use video in your course. The third myth that people often is, Oh, I can't have a course. I don't have an email list, or my email list isn't very big. It's not big enough for a course. Well, having a website and an email list isn't a prerequisite to having a course. I know people who had a book first and then created a course.\
\
[00:34:47.000] - Katie Hornor\
I have a client who actually created a course first and then created her book from the course, and both of those without necessarily having a big email list at all. It is correct that it is easier sometimes to sell your course if you already have a following built up somewhere, social media, for instance. But you'll be able to create and sell your course whether or not you already have a website and email list when you enroll in successful online courses. You Follow the steps that we lay out for you. It's going to work. We had one case study recently who had a list of 150 people. They sold six courses to that list and made over $1,000 in that one launch. So it is entirely possible. We know some people who have sold to a list of over 5,000 and made money off their course. And we know people who have sold to a list of 50,000. It doesn't really matter the size of your following. What matters is that you have people who are engaged with you and are aligned with what you're offering, that they are seeking the solution that you offer them and that you're able to communicate clearly to them so that they understand that you have the transformation that they're trying to get to.\
\
[00:35:58.370] - Katie Hornor\
Okay? And so That leads us then to the fourth myth, the final myth that we're going to talk about today, which is creating a course is too expensive. I don't have all the money to invest in a bunch of programs in order to get my course created. Again, this simply is not true. If you have a way to deliver emails, you can create a very simple and effective course just through your email. Now, there are tools available and you can get as complicated and as expensive as you want to, but you don't have to have all of those things to have a successful online course. You can't use this as an excuse to not create your course and get your transformational message out to the world. I'm sorry, it's just not going to work. There are lots of different ways. You can get a course out there very inexpensively, and the successful in the courses program is the place to learn how to do that with just an email list or with just a very low cost platform to host your course on. It's very inexpensive to get this out there. And in terms what you're going to reap in income, it doesn't even make sense to even entertain the argument that this is too expensive for you to do.\
\
[00:37:07.780] - Katie Hornor\
It's almost backwards. It's almost like it's so inexpensive to create a course these days. Why would you not? And so those are the four myths debunked for you. And just to review that real quickly, you don't have to be techy to have a course. You don't have to have a big email list to have a course. You don't have to be comfortable on video. You don't even have to use video. There's other ways to create content. There are inexpensive ways to get your course out there. You can create content when you know how to move your people from A to Z to get that transformation. You can over deliver to them in terms of the experience. You can do the launch just with the steps that we've outlined in this cheat sheet. So what I want to ask you right now is, are you committed to moving forward? Are you committed to filling out this cheat sheet, going through it in the next 48 hours so that you can get started planning your premium online course? If you're willing to do that, I want you to tell me that in the comments below. I want you to type, Yes, I'm committed, if you're willing to use this cheat sheet and plan out your course in the next 48 hours.\
\
[00:38:21.410] - Katie Hornor\
I've just walked you through it. It's super easy. It's very simple. Let us know, comment, Yes, I'm committed, if you're committed to doing this planning in the next 48 hours. If you don't take action, it's never going to happen.\
\
[00:38:36.250] - Liz Stapleton, Host\

**Transcript:**\
[00:00:13.190] - Elizabeth Stapleton\
All right, guys. I'm really excited for our next speaker. He is a personal finance nerd, an online entrepreneur. He and his wife were buried in student loan debt, which led them to start their personal finance blog. And three years later, or within three years, I should say, they were making multiple six figures. They've both been able to quit their jobs to work on the blog full time. They have a huge passion for helping people with money. And I'm really excited to welcome from 'The Savvy Couple', Kelan Kline. Kelan, thank you so much for being part of the summit!\
\
[00:00:40.610] - Kelan Kline\
Hey, Liz. Thanks for having us. We're so excited to be a part of it this year. \
\
[00:00:46.010] - Elizabeth Stapleton\
Yes. So we're going to be talking about sponsored content, sponsored post, sponsorships with blogs. And you mentioned actually that the first money you ever made was through sponsors. Do you want to share a little bit about that?\
\
[00:00:57.470] - Kelan Kline\
Yeah. After college, I kinda jumped around from job to job. We started our blog as kind of a side hustle to help pay off student loan debt. I was just done working for other people. And nine months into blogging, everyone that started blogging knows that first six months is just insane. The learning curve is crazy, and it's just a grind. And finally in the 9th month, we had an email come in and it said, "Hey, we want to sponsor a post on your blog. We're willing to pay you $50." And we were really small at that time. And just like a light bulb went off and we were so excited. We celebrated. And then two weeks later, I went to Brittany. And this was after we saved up a ton of money and got stable financially. And I said, "Hey, I'd like to quit my job and do this full time." She blessed me to do that. And the rest is history now.\
\
[00:01:41.810] - Elizabeth Stapleton\
Awesome! So, in that instance, someone had reached out to you directly. But that's not always how sponsorship opportunities come about. So obviously, that kinda whetted your appetite. How do you find sponsorships now? How did you when you were still new find those opportunities? Did you pitch directly? Was there a resource?\
\
[00:02:02.150] - Kelan Kline\
Yeah. Good question. I think it's important to know your numbers and know your blog, know your online business. So get those demographics, understand what your pageviews are, put together a nice media kit. That's the first thing that we did. We just made ourselves accessible on our site. We always have an "Advertise with us" page, so if there are brands coming to look to sponsor personal finance blog, we're super easy to access and get a hold of, where a lot of companies fail to do that. That's number one. And that's a good way to get a lot of inbound sponsorships. Then the outbound ones. We kind of take the approach...We're pretty analytical and really good with numbers. I put together an Excel sheet. I'm kind of an Excel nerd. And I have a list of 100 dream companies I would like to work with and it's all filtered by how much they align with our business, how easy they would be to partner with. Like, how big of a company are they. And we just go down the line every month and I reach out to a few. I make it a habit. I always put that time and effort into reaching out to sponsors and getting them interested in getting them to eventually work with us. It is a lot of outreach and a lot of work to do the outreach to get those sponsorship deals, for sure.\
\
[00:03:11.550] - Elizabeth Stapleton\
Sure. But you're using really an inbound or direct outreach. You're not using a website or something.\
\
[00:03:18.330] - Kelan Kline\
Yeah. There are a bunch of sponsored networks that you can use and sign up, and you link your analytics up to and stuff. We've never really found that much luck with them. We've been able to do a couple of social media campaigns, where it's a one-off Tweet or a one-off Facebook post where you get paid $50 to $100. But we're really focused on the big sponsorships that are going to move the needle in our business and give us a big thing of cash flow to reinvest.\
\
[00:03:41.190] - Elizabeth Stapleton\
Okay. So you mentioned media kit and the direct outreach. So what all besides your analytics, what all are you including in your media kit? What are you including in your pitches?\
\
[00:03:53.190] - Kelan Kline\
Media kit shares exactly what The Savvy Couple is about. So our mission, our demographics are very close to who our demographic is, which is millennial moms a certain, at 25 to 35 years old. So, just really understanding our business. Because the whole point of getting a company to work with you is they need help marketing, and they want to get in front of an audience that already has someone that's built trust with them and has that authority. So, they're willing to pay you to get in front of your audience that's their ideal customers. And just knowing your business inside out, it's really important.\
\
[00:04:24.930] - Elizabeth Stapleton\
Okay. So when you pitch, you're obviously including your media kit, but do you do a lengthy email? Is it like a short, "Hey, we'd really love to work with you. We think we really align. Here's our media kit"? How in-depth are you getting? How generalized are those pitches?\
\
[00:04:44.050] - Kelan Kline\
They're very optimized. I know that anyone that we're reaching out to, they have a busy schedule. And everyone's email box is just littered with emails. So it's very quick like, "Hey, my name is Kelan Kline. I'm a personal finance expert that runs The Savvy Couple." And then the next line is, "We're very interested in starting a long-term partnership." So, there are a lot of key terms that you need to use when reaching out to brands and working with them. And the ones that always triggers excitement in them is saying "Long-term partnership," because they don't want a one-off just like you don't. You want to be able to partner with the brand and partner with them year after year. So long term partnership, kind of explained how we align. So if it's a company that's helping increase income, that's exactly what we like to do, too. So we just pair our two missions into one so that we have that alignment. We give a quick thing of stats and bullet points. And at the bottom, we put who we've been featured on or partnered with before. And then the very end is, "Here's our media kit and About Us page so you can learn more." But, yeah. It very strategically, kind of, captivates them, gets them interested, shares exactly what they need to know. And it has had a really good success rate. \
\
[00:05:53.830] - Elizabeth Stapleton\
Awesome. It sounds like it gives them the information they need to want to learn more. Like it's not a waste of their time to keep going. So with the long term partnership, it's not probably just like a post here and there. What do those partnerships look like? How do you determine that? I know it varies by the company you're working with.\
\
[00:06:16.510] - Kelan Kline\
Yeah, that's a great question. So a lot of bloggers and us ourselves, when we are learning this process with sponsorships, they respond to our outreach email, and they'd say, "What does your budget look like?" Or "What is your fees for a sponsored campaign?" And we tell them, "It would be like, $500, $1,000." And they just kept answering like, "Sure, let's do it". Like, just way too easily. And being someone that's an entrepreneur and understands negotiation, I'm like something's up. We're worth more than what we're asking for because they wouldn't be saying yes every time. So then we came up with a strategy like, let's try to get them to tell us what their budget is before we say anything on what we're gonna, kinda the deliverables we're going to give them. So that's a key. And that's one of the big secrets in our strategy is, asking the company what their budget is. And there's a lot of strategy around that and how to word it correctly. But once you get that, the ball is in their court. So they're going to say, "Hey, we have $1,000", "We have $2,500, we have $5000, $10,000 budget. What can you do for us?" And at that point, I take that budget and I look across all of our marketing channels, our email list. We can do multiple blog posts. We've done YouTube videos, we've done social media amplification, we've done Facebook ads. So we put this whole marketing package together for this brand that just gave us what their budget is, and we pitch it to them, and send it in a nice wrap up proposal that they're very interested in. If they've given you a budget. They're interested in working with you. So chances are, if you can send them the right deliverables that they're looking for, you can land that sponsorship.\
\
[00:07:51.190] - Elizabeth Stapleton\
Okay, so, a couple of follow-up questions to that. What are you doing, sort of how are you deciding, okay, I've got this budget. What is that worth in terms of the deliverables I'm going to create? Because I feel like some people, especially if you're a newer blogger, if someone tells you I've got $1,000 budget, you're like, "I've got to do everything!" So how do you determine that?\
\
[00:08:13.870] - Kelan Kline\
It's definitely kinda part of the experience that we've had doing this for so many years now. But, yeah. I think in the beginning, you cut yourself short and say, like you said, I got to do everything. I got to send ten emails for this company and really deliver on them. And a lot of the times these partnerships are one-offs, and you want to do your best and you're going to do your best. But there's a lot of times that you're not gonna meet what they want, and that's okay. The important thing is to kind of, make sure that whatever their budget is, you're only putting in as much time and effort that you're willing to. So, know what your hourly rate is. If you're only willing to work $20 an hour, $25 an hour or you really want to make $50 an hour, you got to calculate how long it's going to take you to put all these assets together for them to run that campaign.\
\
[00:09:02.170] - Elizabeth Stapleton\
Okay. And then you say you put together a really nice proposal. What are you using to create that proposal?\
\
[00:09:07.630] - Kelan Kline\
Just Google Doc, and then I save it as a PDF. It's just a template and a form that we use. It's got our logo top. It kinda explains exactly what the campaign is all about, like an overview, then the deliverables and then the fees. Another thing that I forgot to mention is when you are figuring out what their budget is, another thing that you really want to do is become a good listener and really make it all about them when you're reaching out to this brand and they're starting to interact with you and get that interest. And figure out what their problems are in their marketing and how you can align and make sure you can solve those for them. So if they're looking for just brand awareness, that's a lot easier to do on social media than conversions, where you're going to have to run an email campaign that you can get conversions up. Or you can do call to actions on your blog or write SEO post. But it's important to understand what their problem is and then be that person that can solve it. Just like any business.\
\
[00:09:59.530] - Elizabeth Stapleton\
Yeah. That's a great point. So then, I know you're using their budget to align with the pricing. What happens when it's lower than you expect it to be? Are you just pitching a smaller deliverable? Or are you like, we're going to pass? How do you make that decision?\
\
[00:10:21.710] - Kelan Kline\
Yeah. Great question. Obviously, as a newer blogger, you're going to accept everything because you're making money and it's important to get that win. And that's how we used to be. Now we're very particular. We pass on a lot of brands that offer us a lot of money. It's really making sure that we keep that trust with your audience. And I can't explain how important it is to not just sell yourself out and take any sponsor that comes your way. Make sure it aligns and actually helps your audience. But yeah, if they don't have a budget that aligns with us. And ours now, since we have grown our SEO traffic and grown our brand, we have a pretty big email list. We don't accept anything under $2,500, which seems like a ton. And that's just for a sponsored post, so one article. So again, it's going back to how much time is it going to take you if it aligns with your brand. And then if it's lower than you think, you can literally send an email back and say, "Hey, this budget is a lot lower than we normally work with. We usually work at this price. Is there any way you can meet us halfway?" Or "With your budget, we can only really do X amount of stuff for you unfortunately." And a lot of times you'll turn them down, and then six months later, when you've grown your blog for six months, you can come back and circle back around. And that's something I always like to do and say, "Hey, this is what our stats are now. We'd like to partner again. Do you guys have a bigger budget type of thing?" Just keep that line of communication open. \
\
[00:11:41.090] - Elizabeth Stapleton\
Okay. I think it goes back towards the long-term continued communication. So when you've done a sponsored post, you've done a campaign with a brand and you want to keep that long-term relationship going to work with them again, what are you sending them afterwards that kind of shows the result? How are you showing the results of your work to make it easier to pitch later?\
\
[00:12:12.390] - Kelan Kline\
Yeah. So, you definitely want to send them the article or the YouTube video, whatever the link is or the main deliverable. And send them any social media links that you've sent out. Facebook ads have worked really well for us. That's definitely an advanced marketing technique. But you're able to target an audience and send traffic to an offer. You can make a ton of conversions and people love to see that, as companies. So, I send them screenshots of our Facebook ads. Just keep them updated through the entire process. Say, "Hey, our team's working on the post right now. We're going to send it next week for you to review." Just make them a part of the process. And if it doesn't go as well, you can share why, your feelings on why you didn't think it went as well. But yeah. Just keep in touch over the time. On our Excel sheet too, we like to keep track of the name and the email that we've used, last time we connected with them, and just build that real relationship. Because one of our biggest sponsors we ever had, they asked for our physical address, and they sent us Christmas presents and a Christmas wreath. It was awesome. We obviously built a real relationship with that person we were working with. So, that's huge.\
\
[00:13:21.210] - Elizabeth Stapleton\
Yeah. I think a lot of times people forget whether you're an online business or not, that behind every business are people. You know.\
\
[00:13:32.490] - Kelan Kline\
Exactly.\
\
[00:13:32.540] - Elizabeth Stapleton\
So you're sending them the information, the stats, the results. So, I want to follow up because you mentioned you run ads and ads costs money. So, how are you kind of, how much of maybe the income you're taking from the sponsored post is potentially going towards ads?\
\
[00:13:48.750] - Kelan Kline\
Yeah. Good question. So in our proposals, we usually pitch like a $250 campaign, $500 campaign. We've done $1,000 campaign. And every time we do that, we have the company pay for the ads, and they also pay a little fee for my time to put them together. So if we're running $500 campaign, I usually charge $1,000. $500 of my time plus $500 for the ad campaign. And that's good for them, because whether it works out or not, they get data on marketing from an influencer on how they would market their brand and just really invaluable information. And a lot of times, we've had campaigns that have worked incredibly. And we're all making money. So, we just continue them to run until they run dry.\
\
[00:14:31.650] - Elizabeth Stapleton\
Okay. So, you're saying we're all making money. Obviously, you make money from the sponsored post. Are you also then an affiliate for the company and you're making affiliate commissions as well? Is that usually...\
\
[00:14:41.370] - Kelan Kline\
Correct. I would say 75% of the time we're allowed to use our affiliate links within the sponsored post. So, yeah. We kind of negotiate so, we get a flat front up fee as well as affiliate commission.\
\
[00:14:56.130] - Elizabeth Stapleton\
Which again, that's that long term. Because the upfront fee is a one time but the commissions keep going.\
\
[00:15:00.510] - Kelan Kline\
Yes. Which is another point I want to make. A ton of bloggers, we all get these. I'm sure you get a ton of them, is affiliate emails. People reaching out to you and say, "Hey, we would love for you to join our affiliate. We're paying X amount of dollars. It's a perfect match... bla bla." Obviously, we delete a ton of those. But there are some that are like, Wow, this company wants affiliates. They might have a marketing budget. Let's kind of twist this and say, "Hey, we will join you to our brand. We'll start marketing you as a company that we love and enjoy. It's going to help our audience. But first, we want you to give us a flat fee to do a sponsored campaign with us, and then we'll join the affiliate program and promote you long term." So, a lot of times those are awesome outbound emails that you can send to kind of take those cold, outreach affiliate emails to you and turn back and make some awesome money from them. \
\
[00:15:49.410] - Elizabeth Stapleton\
Yeah. And then you're making money that much faster because affiliate income can take a while. And even if you earn those commissions, they might not be paid out for months.\
\
[00:15:58.170] - Kelan Kline\
Right. \
\
[00:16:00.930] - Elizabeth Stapleton\
Okay. So another thing I want to ask...And I'm not going to ask you to get into too many details because we have a session with a lawyer on this. I assume you're signing a contract. I really hope. What sort of terms are you including in there? I've heard horror stories of people being, like, "Two years later, the post no longer aligned with my brand. I took it down." And then they did a charge-back on PayPal. So, what kind of terms are you including in your sponsorship agreement?\
\
[00:16:27.930] - Kelan Kline\
Yeah. So, we use a sponsored agreement that we got from a lawyer as well. And it's super easy to fill out and reuse it over and over. But, yeah. You're making sure everyone is on the same page with what the deliverables are, the time frame on when they're due, how long they're going to last, the pricing that's going to get paid, the pricing structure...Are you going to get paid up front? In the middle? At the end? Multiple payments or one payment at once? Just all the very important information that you definitely want to get in a contract signed by everybody. You can use an email thread as your contract but it's definitely better...\
\
[00:17:03.750] - Elizabeth Stapleton\
Yeah, it's written. We have an entire session with an attorney talking about contracts for bloggers. So, I'm not going to ask you to say what qualifies as a contract. But just kind of knowing those terms because I think a lot of people don't think about, well, I may want to take this down someday. And some of those other things. What are some other mistakes or roadblocks that you've made or that you've heard of that obviously you've learned from, but what are some things you see happening a lot?\
\
[00:17:31.590] - Kelan Kline\
Yeah. This one happened this year, actually. We agreed verbally and writtenly in an email, and we put together two sponsored posts for them. We started to put the campaign together, and then all of a sudden it's like, "Hey, we're not going to do it anymore. We're backing out. We're not paying you." It was like, EH! That was the first time it has ever happened. So, we have a rule now that we get paid at least a deposit upfront. And mostly, I'd say 99% of the time, it's "Give us everything up front." Unless it's a massive campaign, then we'll do half up front, half at the end. So definitely a roadblock is making sure you get paid up, paid in advance and just talking your way into doing that just to protect yourself so that you do get payment up front and then you can do the deliverables. You don't get caught out to dry. \
\
[00:18:17.010] - Elizabeth Stapleton\
Yeah. No one wants to chase invoices.\
\
[00:18:19.050] - Kelan Kline\
Exactly.\
\
[00:18:21.330] - Elizabeth Stapleton\
So what is the timelines of, oftentimes from, whether you guys outreach or they reach out, to deciding on the terms, to when everything gets published and sent out and the campaign runs and how long is the campaign? What does that timeline look like?\
\
[00:18:36.450] - Kelan Kline\
Yeah. So I'd say the cold outreach emails, it's sometimes hard to find people in the corporations and in the company. And all big companies work very slowly. So it's usually about a month to get to the right person, start talking. And then from there, the timeline really depends on, like one of the companies we were working with is H&R Block and tax season is on its way. So there's a deadline like, we want this content now at this point in the year, so that it's pitched at the right time, and it makes sense with H&R Block. So, there's a lot of stuff like that as far as timelines, and that's just how you go off things. But I'd say, from start to finish, you outreach email to the end of the campaign where you're done with your social media, you're done sending emails, probably two to three months, most likely. \
\
[00:19:31.210] - Elizabeth Stapleton\
Okay. How many, and obviously, it's going to depend on various factors, but how many sponsorships are you doing on average a year? How many would you recommend a new blogger do, if they can get them?\
\
[00:19:40.450] - Kelan Kline\
Yeah. I think realistically, one a month is totally doable for just about anybody, no matter how small you are. Companies want to get in front of brands, and they know, well sometimes you have to teach them this. But there's value in partnering with smaller companies, because then two years from now, the blog is going to be much bigger and you're still going to be getting promoted by them. So I think one a month is definitely doable. We try to land at least one big one per month and then our best month, we probably did four. So in a total year, we're doing anywhere from 12 to 20 sponsorships. And a lot of them are with companies from before. So it's promoting the same companies that align with our brand and we work before. So it's just a win-win for everybody.\
\
[00:20:27.070] - Elizabeth Stapleton\
That sounds great. So, I know you said your very first money blogging was $50 sponsorship. How big do you think the site has to be before they start going off after those sponsorships? Because it's probably not as big as they think.\
\
[00:20:39.010] - Kelan Kline\
Yeah,no, that's an awesome question. I think it's important to be able to get traffic to your blog and understand what you're doing, understand how to create content that gets seen and write good titles. It's important to be able to market yourself before you market someone else. So, I don't know if there's an exact number. It's feeling confident in being able to market yourself and get the traffic. I feel like I started reaching out when we had 1000 page views a month, which starting out, that's huge. It takes a long time to get to that point. But then once you do, you can definitely start reaching out, especially if you have social media channels, followings in other places and email lists. You can just build those assets that you can pitch the brands. \
\
[00:21:21.370] - Elizabeth Stapleton\
Yeah. And the more you do it, the more you're able to. I think when other brands see that you've worked with brands, even if they're not big-name brands, it shows that you know what you're doing. So, you got to start somewhere.\
\
[00:21:31.330] - Kelan Kline\
Yep. Absolutely. And I think that's a good point, that you want to start with smaller brands. You don't want to go after...If you're trying to work with Target, you don't want to go after Target if you're just brand new. Start with a brand that's much smaller and work your way up, build up your experience. And then when you have your stuff together and you have the experience, you know how to do communication, networking, and negotiating, then you can check those big partners.\
\
[00:21:54.490] - Elizabeth Stapleton\
So one thing I want to ask you is, because I also have experience to try to track down the right person in the organization, it can be rather difficult. What are, sort of, the titles of the people that you found are the right people to be reaching out to when you're looking for a contact?\
\
[00:22:12.790] - Kelan Kline\
Definitely affiliate managers. Because you're in the right department there as far as sponsorships or marketing, marketing channels, press pages, some people that are looking for press. A lot of the companies will have at the very bottom. You can see Affiliate or Press or Marketing or Media, any of those kinds of channels will get you started in the right spot. And, you know, sometimes you got to start with someone that's in totally wrong department and just say in the PS like, "If this is the wrong person, can you point me in the right direction to the right person to contact?" And that's huge.\
\
[00:22:44.350] - Elizabeth Stapleton\
It does. It works really well. It would surprise you. People are like, this is not me. But instead of just ignoring it and not replying, they'll be like, "Oh, well, they know it might not be me, and I can pass this along." It always surprises me when that works because it's such a simple thing. So, any last bits of advice before...I know you've got something that you have for our audience, but any final words of advice?\
\
[00:23:11.590] - Kelan Kline\
Yeah. I think the biggest thing with all things blogging is, build your confidence. Know that you are an awesome individual to even go out on a limb and start your own project, start your own business. And sponsorships definitely it's a part of the blogging business that it takes a lot of confidence and takes a lot of encouragement to go out and do it. And you're going to hear a lot of Nos before your Yeses. So just get out there. Practice. Start with a small fish. Practice makes perfect. So just start working on the small fish and getting practice and getting experience and then slowly work your way up. And bloggers and online creation can get sponsorships everywhere. \
\
[00:23:46.270] - Elizabeth Stapleton\
Awesome. Thank you. So, you want to tell the people that are watching what you have for them? The link is down below, but tell them a little bit about it.\
\
[00:23:54.610] - Kelan Kline\
Yeah. So, we have a sponsorship starter guide. It's our step-by-step strategy in landing sponsorships, and it has worked for us to build our blog to multiple six figures. It has worked for a bunch of other friends and other bloggers. So, definitely check it out. It's going to give you some really invaluable information to follow a step-by-step process to start landing sponsorships and increasing income.\
\
[00:24:13.630] - Elizabeth Stapleton\
I'm definitely going to have checked that out myself. Because I've never been the one for a lot of sponsorships. I think I've done like, three and I've been blogging for eight years. And then, I think you have something for people who purchase the Pro Pass as well.\
\
[00:24:26.950] - Kelan Kline\
Yeah. So we have a...A lot of our sponsorships are evergreen and really driven with SEO content and stuff that's going to market brands for a long time. So, we have a HARO strategy guide. It's our strategy and even email templates on how we answer HARO request, which is 'Help a Reporter Out' with big companies like Forbes, and Business Insider, and USA Today, answering those requests and getting backlinks and mentions on those so you can really exponentially grow your blog and build those backlinks for SEO traffic.\
\
[00:24:56.170] - Elizabeth Stapleton\
Yes. So if that's something that you're interested in, you should definitely make sure you guys grab the Pro Pass. Kelan, thank you so much. I appreciate you sharing all of your knowledge. And I look forward to seeing you guys continue to grow.\
\
[00:25:09.010] - Kelan Kline\
Appreciate it, Liz. Thank you.\

\
**Transcript:**\
[00:00:13.190] - Kim\
Hey, what's going on? Welcome to Teach.Connect.Sell. We're going to jump into this and this is broken into a walkthrough of what Teach.Connect.Sell is. And then we're going to go into actual emails and we're going to walk, walk through how this whole thing is set up. So first of all, who I am and why I love email.\
\
[00:00:33.370] - Kim\
My name is Kim Doyal at kimdoyal.com. And I started my business way back in 2008. It feels like a long time ago now. When I started, I really didn't know what I was doing.\
\
[00:00:45.500] - Kim\
I was just committed to finding something online that would give me the quality of life I wanted. I started out as the WordPress chick, and I moved to my personal brand in 2018. I started podcasting way back in 2013. Isn't that funny? In Internet years, it feels like a lifetime ago.\
\
[00:01:02.990] - Kim\
It was the WordPress Chick podcast, and it's evolved and is now currently F the Hustle with Kim Doyal. I launched an ecommerce brand, the Content Creators Planner in 2018 that went from a failed kick starter to 67,000 a month in sales. I've done websites. I grew an outsourcing company. I've had a podcast production company, but honestly, my sweet spot is coaching and courses along that journey.\
\
[00:01:30.340] - Kim\
I really fell in love with email marketing and newsletters, and I launched my faithful newsletter in 2019. I have an email insiders cohort based training that I started last year. And I have been doubling down on email marketing and newsletters over the last couple of years, mainly because it is the greatest return I have gotten in my business. Alright, so why email? First of all, you set the tone for building a relationship with your subscribers. You want to remember that your email list is an asset.\
\
[00:02:07.360] - Kim\
It is the traffic that you own and control. According to HubSpot, there are 4 billion daily email users. Email generates $42 for every one dollars spent, which is an astounding 4200% return on investment, making it one of the most effective options available also via HubSpot and marketers who use segments and campaigns noted as much as a 760% increase in revenue and four out of five marketers. So, they'd rather give up social media than email marketing. And I'm just going to go ahead and say, yes, I am all over that.\
\
[00:02:41.350] - Kim\
And I have a saying I jokingly say, and bear with me, the language that this shit works. Email marketing is the only thing I regret not doing sooner in my business. Like I said, I've been online 14 years now and man, if I had wrapped my head around this and really dug in, things would be different. However, it's never too late to get into email marketing. So, this Teach.Connect.Sell outline is totally based on a framework by Brennan Dunn, who is brilliant of creating Cell Co.\
\
[00:03:13.490] - Kim\
Check him out and he has this lesson bridge pitch, survey process. I needed to break it down. Brennan is a programmer and developer, very smart guy. And I needed to break it down to wrap it around my brain. So, this is what I'm going to show you.\
\
[00:03:28.750] - Kim\
We're going to do a visual. I'm going to walk you through the process, and I'm going to talk through the emails. I want you to start understanding the value of what this looks like. So, the Teach piece, we're using Teach.Connect.Sell, is a lead magnet. Okay.\
\
[00:03:45.960] - Kim\
This is where you're going to it's an opt in. Think of it as an email course, like a mini email course. You want to use this as your lead magnet. And this is to set the tone for your subscribers. And this will make a lot more sense when we go through the actual emails.\
\
[00:04:02.710] - Kim\
But we're going to go ahead and start with the Teach piece. This is a pretty involved email sequence, but once you set it up, remember, you don't have to do anything with this. So, the first three emails, we're going to identify that there is a problem. Right. And so, I'm going to break these down individually.\
\
[00:04:20.970] - Kim\
The second three emails that are going to get sent are going to let your subscriber know that the good news is the problem can be solved. And the last three emails are going to identify that you're the one to solve the problem. Alright. So, let's dig into this a little bit deeper. So, again, the first three emails, there's a problem.\
\
[00:04:40.820] - Kim\
We're going to identify the problem. Then you're going to reiterate it. And this is sort of when you say I've been in your shoes and email number three is still there's a problem. And so, we want to sort of drive home that pain point of what happens if you don't fix the problem.\
\
[00:04:58.790] - Kim\
Now, one thing I want to point out with email and writing, a lot of people might feel that I'm not a good writer. Think of this, just like you're talking to friends. Everything is content. And just like you're communicating to one person, there is a rule of one and copy.\
\
[00:05:14.890] - Kim\
And you want to apply this here. You're just talking to one person about one problem here. So, don't overthink this. And this isn't negative to come at this from a place of kind of driving home that pain point.\
\
[00:05:29.490] - Kim\
Good writing, good copy, email that converts all of that is based on psychology of why people, human beings, are driven to do things. And most people will do more to avoid pain than to gain pleasure. Alright. So, we've got the first three emails that are there is a problem.\
\
[00:05:45.990] - Kim\
The second three emails, remember, we're going to identify. Hey, good news. The problem can be solved. Right. So email number four, that's what we're going to drive home.\
\
[00:05:55.530] - Kim\
Email number five is how things are going to start changing. We want them to start getting into that feeling place of what life will look like, what you know the circumstance will change, how it will change when the problem is solved. Email number six is how things change for you when you solve the problem. Right. So, now we're starting to pull in more social proof here.\
\
[00:06:18.750] - Kim\
The last three emails. We're going to start talking about why you are the one to solve the problem. This is to build in some trust because we've identified the problem, we've let them know it can be solved. And now you want to start building that trust and that relationship that you're the one that can solve the problem. And so, email number seven, we're going to jump in with why you want to help them solve the problem.\
\
[00:06:40.540] - Kim\
This is a connection piece, right? Email number eight, we're going to start giving a little bit more social proof proof who you've helped solve the problem. And email number nine is ways that you can help them solve the problem. So, again, we're going to show them why you want to help them, who you've helped and different ways you can help. But we're still not making an offer here.\
\
[00:07:07.230] - Kim\
Alright. After we've sent those nine emails and there's a whole sequence for when they get sent, we're going to wait three days before sending two connection emails. And this connection piece is we're going to be connecting the initial lessons, right? Those nine emails. Think of this again as a mini email course.\
\
[00:07:25.340] - Kim\
We're going to connect those with an offer we're going to make. So, email number ten is very specific to now that you finish the email course, the next thing you need. Right. We're kind of bridging that offer that's coming with what they've already gone through. And so there's two emails.\
\
[00:07:45.910] - Kim\
And again, you'll see the breakdown in the actual emails. So, we're going to send, now that you finish the email course, and email number eleven is I've got a special offer coming for you next week again. So we're setting them up to let them know that something is coming. This is just a reiteration of that. And then we're going to wait three days before sending the offer.\
\
[00:08:07.730] - Kim\
Okay. And I'm going to go into this little bit in more detail here. So, the offer emails, we're going to start with email number twelve. Remember that special offer I promised, and then we're going to go into details about that. Email number 13 is the special offer reminder and FAQs. And I'll explain that.\
\
[00:08:27.080] - Kim\
And you see these little dollar signs. It's because we're making an offer. So, each of these, the content, the body of the email is going to talk about something you have for sale that is related. It's like the next logical step from those first initial nine emails. Email number 13.\
\
[00:08:45.160] - Kim\
Again, this is the special offer reminder and FAQs. And I'll explain a little bit more. Email number 14 is the final reminder. And you're going to send these two on the same day, so one will be in the morning and one could be five, six, seven 'o' clock at night that this offer is closing. You can use a tool like Deadline Funnel, but you want to let them know that the offer goes away.\
\
[00:09:07.900] - Kim\
And so, if you're going to do that, you can either have a coupon that expires. You can use a tool like deadline funnels, deadline funnels. So, there's a handful of options to deal with that, to do that. But you see what we're doing here. And so with the 14 emails we're sending these over a period of a couple of weeks.\
\
[00:09:31.370] - Kim\
And so you're building this relationship with people. And the point of this is to see if you can acquire a customer and remember what you're offering solves the problem as well. So, we've identified the first problem, and this would be the next logical thing. You know in the example I'm going to share with you. It's all about email marketing. So, it'd be the next thing to help people understand email marketing as an example.\
\
[00:09:54.710] - Kim\
Alright. So, after we've done the special offer, we're going to wait a week before sending the follow up. This is teach, connect, sell. Right. So, this is a follow up piece that we add in there.\
\
[00:10:04.680] - Kim\
And we're going to find out why they didn't buy. So, we're going to send them to a survey. So there are five questions you can ask here. You're going to ask them and keep in mind not everyone's going to answer your survey. So, don't be worried about that.\
\
[00:10:19.080] - Kim\
But you want to simply ask them. I noticed you didn't buy product name. You didn't buy the product. I'm curious. If you don't mind, would you just click and let me know?\
\
[00:10:28.870] - Kim\
Was it that you didn't have the time, it's not in your budget right now, maybe it's not something you need, it's not relevant, you don't know me yet.\
\
[00:10:37.320] - Kim\
Want to establish a little bit more of a relationship or, hey, maybe you just missed the deadline. And so, this is an opportunity to extend the offer if you so choose. So, this is all to kind of gauge. And you notice what you're doing here, too, is you're segmenting. Right. And so, you'll get data from this in terms of if you get a bunch of people that say, you know they don't need it, then you want to question where those leads are coming in and what they do need from you.\
\
[00:11:05.180] - Kim\
So, it could be a message and market mismatch there. Alright. So, that's the basic outline next. What we're going to do is I'm going to actually pull up the emails. I'm going to talk you through how we're structuring the actual content of those emails. So, you can see that they'll build one on top of the other.\
\
[00:11:25.840] - Kim\
Alright. So, let's jump into the emails. Alright. Here we go. We're going to jump into the emails, and I'm going to walk you through the why behind a lot of this and so that you can see how these are going to build one on top of the other.\
\
[00:11:40.790] - Kim\
Alright. So, these first three emails, again, we are defining that there's a problem. So, email number one, remember, there's a problem. We're going to start simply by identifying the problem here and all of these are set up. This is basically the email outline. There's not the body content necessarily.\
\
[00:11:57.580] - Kim\
But I'm going to tell you what the content will be, are set with email sending subject content. Call to action. That's what the CTA is. So email number one, there's a problem. We're going to send it immediately.\
\
[00:12:09.300] - Kim\
The subject is, how many times have you heard this? The content is all about the money is in the list. By now, you've probably heard this. This is sort of the war cry of the Internet marketer, that all you need to do is build an email list.\
\
[00:12:23.620] - Kim\
And that's where your money is. It's actually very true, but it's not as easy as it used to be when this whole thing came about. And there's also a much more human way to approach this in terms of it's all about the right list that you build a relationship with, that you serve and they become hungry to buy from you because you've built the relationship and they trust you. You've already shown them that you understand what their challenges are, what the opportunities are and how you can help them, and you do a lot of that for free, as well as having offers that solve their problems. Okay.\
\
[00:12:59.590] - Kim\
So, I'm going to talk a lot about the money isn't list. I'm going to sort of drive home that pain point of being sold that it's just as easy as having a list when it's not because you can build a list and really not know what to do with it, which tends to be where a lot of people drop off. The call to action is I'm going to send them to a podcast episode that I did sort of recently, and it's called email marketing. It's never too late to start. And so, the point of this, right is that I am sending people to my site.\
\
[00:13:32.760] - Kim\
So, this is just kind of a bigger picture view here and that I'm sending them back to my site. And what I love about audio and podcasting is that people or video, but that people can hear the inflection in your voice. There's a connection there. And so, people are willing to listen or watch you, you know that's sort of an added bonus, which is why I'm sending them to a podcast.\
\
[00:13:56.640] - Kim\
Email number two. Still talking about the problem here. We're going to reiterate the problem and we're going to drive home that you have been in their shoes. You're going to send this. One day, after email number one, the subject line is, how did it go?\
\
[00:14:10.400] - Kim\
You might want to include an emoji in this one the thinking emoji like, well, what do you think. And be careful, I don't say be careful, but test emojis sort of strategically. I wouldn't put too many in a subject line. You can test putting it after or before the subject line. See how that works for you.\
\
[00:14:31.630] - Kim\
I know when I send my newsletter I have started adding an emoji prior to the Hustle and I send the emoji right before I put it in the subject line. And Interestingly enough, it's the exact same emoji every week, and my open rates and click through rates are going up because it kind of grabs people's attention right away. So, test that. Just use them sparingly in the body of an email. The content, how did it go, is referring to how did it go when you launched something without an email list and how deflating it is when you don't get any results. You put all this time and energy into create something that you know can help people, but you don't really have a relationship with your list.\
\
[00:15:15.080] - Kim\
You either don't really have a list and so, you try and do it via social only, which there was a time when that probably worked somewhat well. But the deflation comes from all this time and energy and then no one buys even when you do email, because again, if you haven't built a relationship with those subscribers and haven't developed a pattern for communicating with them regularly, they don't trust you enough to just buy when they haven't heard from you. The call to action I'm going to link to a live stream my business partner and I did for the Content Creators planner, and that was how we went from a failed kick starter to over 40,000 a month in sales, which that continued to grow. But the point in sharing this is that we were able to do that because we had a list because I had a list that we launched this to.\
\
[00:16:06.720] - Kim\
We had a relationship with people. We were communicating the whole time what was happening. And so, when we let people know, excuse me, when we let people know that we weren't going to reach the kick starter goal, there was a little bit of a panic like, oh my gosh, I still want this. You're going to continue with it? We said absolutely, we pivoted presold it took care of everything on our own site.\
\
[00:16:27.200] - Kim\
But the point is, excuse me, the point with linking to this is that that worked because we had an email list that we had a relationship with. Alright, and the last email for the, there's a problem, we're going to talk about what happens if they don't fix the problem. We're going to send this the day after email number two, the subject line is vanity metrics don't pay the bills. Or you can have some fun with this. As an example, you could say I couldn't deposit my Facebook likes in the bank or I couldn't deposit my Twitter followers in the bank being a little bit more really driving that pain point home.\
\
[00:17:09.400] - Kim\
So, the content of this email is going to be that there was a time when organic social work. And you guys, it still does. It's not my specialty, but we want to drive home that your followers, your fans, whatever platform you're using, you don't necessarily have permission. You don't have permission to land in those people's inbox. \
\
[00:17:32.360] - Kim\
So, you have to hope that people see it in their feeds and they engage with your content. All of that. And again, there's an absolute place for that. But again, they're not an asset. You don't want to think of them the way your email list is an asset, and you get to control how solid of a relationship you have with them.\
\
[00:17:51.100] - Kim\
Alright. So, this email again, we're going to talk about there was a time when organic social worked to a certain degree. When you focus on growing followers and fans instead of relationships, you end up stuck in a loop of creating content for people who have no intention of buying. We call these freebie seekers. And the truth is, there's a balance in the content you create as well.\
\
[00:18:10.280] - Kim\
You don't necessarily want to just constantly create here's how to do this, and here's how to do this. You can teach the why of something. But when you teach people too much for free, it often becomes, why should I pay you for this when you've been giving me everything for free? So, you wanna, that's a fine line to walk as well. All right.\
\
[00:18:30.140] - Kim\
And so the call to action for this email is to listen to why I'm doubling down on email marketing. It's another podcast episode. And what I will tell you is what you're also doing with these emails. You'll notice that the structure is the same for each of these. A call to action. It is very rare that I don't include a link.\
\
[00:18:50.410] - Kim\
I would say maybe three or four times a year do I send emails without a link? And those tend to be more of a personal message of it's been a tough year. Be gentle, enjoy your weekend or you know here's where I've been, or what I've been up to. That's a relationship builder, too.\
\
[00:19:10.020] - Kim\
So don't necessarily think that every single time you send an email, you have to have a call to action. But what this is doing is setting a precedence that there is a call to action. And you're seeing where people are clicking through all of this is also going to help you gather data. The second three emails, this is the problem can be solved. So, email number four, this is the good news, right?\
\
[00:19:33.940] - Kim\
And we're sending this the day after email number three, the subject line is Holy Moly. And again, this shit works. Content is we're going to start with the almost daily emails. I did this when I really made a very deliberate decision to focus on email marketing six years ago or so. And there are a lot of people that do daily emails.\
\
[00:19:57.070] - Kim\
I called up my almost daily emails because sometimes emailed on the weekend, sometimes I didn't. But this is a story based email where I let them know. The first month, it was crickets. Month two, I started getting a lot of responses. By month three, I had tripled affiliate income for a product that I talked about and taught about and was using regularly.\
\
[00:20:19.130] - Kim\
And I still get affiliate payments every single month from this company because of the amount of content I have around that. But the point is I'm sharing the story of how I was committed to sending daily emails and what that looked like. So, then the call to action is to send them to a story based email about my choice to move to Costa Rica. I got a lot of responses. So, I also want you to think about bringing there's a difference between personal and private and email, but the more you are relatable, the more people feel connected to you.\
\
[00:20:51.170] - Kim\
So, by sharing a little bit of personal and so many people have loved that I shared the journey of living in another country with them. And so, I send them to a blog post, which was one of my daily emails. The email was simply, it's official I'm moving to Costa Rica. That was the subject line.\
\
[00:21:09.820] - Kim\
I republished it as a blog post, and I highly recommend you do that. Let go of is this supposed to be SEO or not? Because sometimes it's the personal connection emails that drive a lot of traffic, comments and sharing as well. There's a great balance there. Right?\
\
[00:21:24.730] - Kim\
So that's where I'm going to send them. Email number five. Now, again, we're talking about the problem being solved and how things can change. And so, the subject line is let's play the What If game and I had a post and it's an exercise. What if?\
\
[00:21:44.470] - Kim\
Right. What if it were easy? And so, the point being is you really need to have a reframe. You need to change your mindset about email marketing. There's a lot of blocks there. And I'm just going to say this is that it won't get easier until you do it, just to get comfortable with the discomfort.\
\
[00:22:01.620] - Kim\
Initially, it is so worth it and it pays off. So, let's play the What If game. What if you could send an email and make sales? Once you've mastered the basics, then you can get a little more ninja and start automating. So, the whole point of this email, the body content is going to be to get people to reframe what this looks like?\
\
[00:22:20.720] - Kim\
What if you could send an email and make sales? What if your primary marketing was emailing three or four times a week and you could grow a consistent, passive income of a signature course or an entry level course? Whatever you want to look like. But the point of this is get them to start thinking, what if it were easy? What if email really does work?\
\
[00:22:43.040] - Kim\
And then I would include in this piece another example kind of like ,where I talked about tripling the affiliate income. I would give a very specific example of sending email and having sales come in. Right. So, the call to action here is to have some fun with the what if game. I've done a post on it, and so, I want people to go through and reframe.\
\
[00:23:05.880] - Kim\
Right. So, they're starting to shift here. You see the psychology that's happening. I'll give a little bit of social proof in the content, but is, I'm wanting to get people to buy into for lack of a better term. Email really works and it can be fun.\
\
[00:23:21.450] - Kim\
Email number six. This is still the problem can be solved. And this is very specific to how things changed. For me. The subject line is feel the fear and do it anyways.\
\
[00:23:33.570] - Kim\
And I was so nervous about using the language. Okay. This is the content. Right. So, I'm going to tell the story of being very uncomfortable with cart's closing.\
\
[00:23:45.370] - Kim\
Today is the last day. That sort of it feels sales pressurey. It feels a little bit smarty. But the truth is you're stating a fact, today is the last day. The cart is closing. Scarcity works.\
\
[00:23:59.530] - Kim\
It's not good, bad or indifferent. It just is when it's legitimate. I mean, don't say you have a limited amount of a PDF or something, but when a sale is ending, when the cart is closing, you want to do that. So, the content of this is really to let them know that, I was also nervous. So, this is becoming relatable.\
\
[00:24:17.530] - Kim\
I'm letting them know that I was nervous about shifting. I was nervous about people unsubscribing, which I don't ever like it. But I got over it. And so, talking about how you show up genuinely authentically as yourself and how it works. And so, the call to action is that it's easier than you think.\
\
[00:24:38.420] - Kim\
I'm sending them to a very specific issue of F the Hustle. And this was marketing lessons from Adele. And the point of that email, that newsletter was here's this world famous musician who took a sabbatical for like six years, went through a divorce, all of these things and comes out so honestly and so authentic about the challenges, the time to herself. And this is why people love her.\
\
[00:25:04.380] - Kim\
She's so genuine. And I'm not saying everybody loves Adele, but you can't deny she's talented and she is very very well liked. She's very honest. And I have no doubt that a lot of her success is also attributed to her being genuinely and authentically herself. And I gave a couple of links to recent concerts and stuff where she showed a vulnerable side of herself, that it endeared her to people.\
\
[00:25:30.190] - Kim\
Right. So that's what that was. The whole point of this email, again is how things changed for me when I started showing up genuinely what that meant for me with email. You guys, I get responses to almost every single email I send, and sometimes it's like, oh, I love this. Thanks for sharing. Happy New Year.\
\
[00:25:45.980] - Kim\
It doesn't matter. But the fact that people feel comfortable replying to an email says you have a relationship with them. All right. The last three emails, this is why you are the one to solve the problem. And this is why you want to help them solve the problem.\
\
[00:26:03.210] - Kim\
Alright. And obviously the send, I'm not repeating each of these here, but the subject line is I deleted over 3000 people. And the content of this is telling them that I had built a list of freebie seekers when I was the WordPress chick. And I would say I was 100% responsible for teaching people not to buy from me. I had this fear of putting in links and selling whether it was affiliate stuff or like, promoting myself too much. And you guys just truly is my biggest regret.\
\
[00:26:34.850] - Kim\
And to the point where I would get people emailing me, how do I do this? And how do I that? And then I would get offended. And I would think, well, you can hire me, but I didn't let them know they could hire me. Or I didn't make it easy to say, oh, you know what?\
\
[00:26:47.760] - Kim\
I've already answered that in this product here, you can purchase this here. And so, I wanted people to understand that I want to help them avoid spending all this time and energy building a list of people that think you're here to serve them for free all the time. And that's a big generalization. But anyone who has done that understands that pain point. And as soon as I took 100% responsibility for the one who created that, that's when it was time to change it.\
\
[00:27:18.350] - Kim\
Alright. And then I have a podcast episode. I had a previous lead magnet course. And it was called Content Traffic Kickstarter. And what I did with that podcast episode is I shared how I added 500 people in less than ten days, completely free.\
\
[00:27:37.440] - Kim\
And so, there was a piece of that that explains the long term goal. So, what this is doing is this is establishing trust with people they're getting in and listening to why I created a totally free course. I had many people tell me you should have charged for this. I got great testimonials, all of that. But the point is this was very specific to the next thing for sale.\
\
[00:28:03.810] - Kim\
So, this free course, Content Traffic Kickstarter. Anybody who signed up for that you know ended up becoming an ideal client for the content creators planner. So there is that what comes next, sort of the value ladder. If you've ever heard Russell Brunson talk about that. But the point is, again, I'm going to tell them that I've done the same thing. I want to help them avoid the pain I taught people not to buy for me biggest regret, and I want to help them make an offer initially, which is what Teach.Connect.Sell is all about.\
\
[00:28:36.080] - Kim\
And then I'm sending them to a podcast episode on why I created a totally free course, because that might sound contrary to building a list of freebie seekers. But it's all explained in the podcast episode. Email number eight is you're the one to solve the problem still, who you've helped solve the problem. So, the subject line is only eight emails to $7,000. This is when I went through.\
\
[00:29:01.590] - Kim\
I have a course on launching, and there was a very specific eight email sequence to selling a course. And so, I have a course called List Explosion, and I did it as a workshop initially, and then I broke it down into a much deeper, I don't know, six modules. There's like 30 lessons in there, whatever. But I literally use the language that was outside of my comfort zone. The last day, it was cart's closing, 5'o' clock, keep, 3 hours left, and I followed the structure.\
\
[00:29:34.870] - Kim\
I just told myself, okay, this might be uncomfortable, but we're going to test this. So, I followed this exact eight email sequence and with only eight emails made $7,000 for this course. Not huge, but it also wasn't a huge list. But who wouldn't want to be able to say I only sent eight emails and I made $7,000 and it was only a $297 course. So, you start thinking, what if I had done more and you do the math, right?\
\
[00:29:59.220] - Kim\
What if my list was twice the size? It would have been a $14,000. So, you see the value and how this all links together. So, the call to action is how I created a list of people who were interested and ready for this explosion. And maybe in this case I would link to my favorite lead capture tool of choice, which is Convert box.\
\
[00:30:18.810] - Kim\
Alright. Email number nine, this is still you're the one to solve the problem. We want to talk about ways you can help them solve the problem. And remember, we're still not making an offer. So, the subject line is great. But what do I do first?\
\
[00:30:32.480] - Kim\
And you can maybe play with this? Great. I'm sold on email marketing. I don't know where to start, something like that. So, this would be a blog post, or you could do it as a blog post.\
\
[00:30:43.330] - Kim\
I actually just have a workbook. So, this is where I'm going to share the three different stages of email marketing, where they're at in their journey and then link to one resource for each stage, meaning the one resource will apply to each stage. And the goal with this email is to give them one tangible action they can apply. That will make a difference today. So, in this case, this email marketing quick start workbook is about identifying where you are in your email marketing journey.\
\
[00:31:10.090] - Kim\
So, maybe you say I have an opt in on my site, or maybe you start with I have nothing. I don't know where to start. Maybe number two is I have an email opt in. I have a list. I don't really know what to do with it.\
\
[00:31:21.610] - Kim\
Maybe number three is I have an opt in. I have a lead magnet. I email my list. I'm not sure how to monetize it very well. Right.\
\
[00:31:30.000] - Kim\
And so, the workbook will help them identify where they're at and the one thing they can do to move forward in that space. Alright. So, we have sent that's the mini email course. Those first nine emails is what we're calling our mini email course. In this case, it's easy email marketing.\
\
[00:31:48.030] - Kim\
Now, what we're going to do is we're going to wait three days after that last email and we're going to send two emails. These are our connect emails. Remember, teach, connect, sell. So, email number ten. The purpose of these two emails is to connect the free mini email course they went through with the upcoming paid offer, which is going to be the next thing they need.\
\
[00:32:07.080] - Kim\
So, we're going to send it three days after email number nine. The subject line is now that you've finished the email course, and the content of this, again, is still telling, it's story based. Right. But we're going to say in this piece, it's a story based email on the first step in dipping your toes into email marketing. And again, I'm going to reiterate the almost daily email story, and I'll go a little bit more tangible.\
\
[00:32:34.130] - Kim\
And with this piece, you could pull in something different. Maybe you don't want to reiterate a story you've already shared. But now that you've finished the email course, you want to start prepping them, that there's a next step in this sequence. Right. And in this instance, you can say, oh, I've got something special coming for you next week.\
\
[00:32:51.860] - Kim\
You can iterate that, reiterate it in both of these. Right. But I would send a call to action to a daily email. That's a story based email that I published also as a blog post. But I want people to see that it doesn't always have to be this really in depth.\
\
[00:33:07.530] - Kim\
Here's a strategy that you have to have data, and you don't. You need to simply start because otherwise, you're going to be overwhelmed with I don't know how to structure an email or a heading. And I don't understand copy whatever you need to simply start writing is my point with this. Okay. So, the call to action would be to link to another example of a daily email.\
\
[00:33:28.890] - Kim\
Email number eleven, we're going to send this one day after email number ten. And again, this is letting them know you've got a special offer coming next week. So, the subject line will be a drumroll, please. And here we're going to drive home now that they understand the value of email, maybe they're having doubts about the ability to write emails that will connect and sell.\
\
[00:33:48.510] - Kim\
And then I want to drive home this piece here that is you know, it's hard to beat being able to send an email to an engaged list of people who are hungry for what you offer. And I often say nothing beats notification of payment because it's true when you're doing something else and you open your inbox and you're like, oh, I sold something. So, we're just setting them up and it's next week. I've got a special offer for you until then, check out one of my favorite email marketing tools.\
\
[00:34:14.010] - Kim\
I've already done Convert box above. So, maybe it's going to be ConvertKit. I use Spark Loop for referrals. There's a handful of options here and both of these. Let me tell you.\
\
[00:34:22.210] - Kim\
So when I mentioned Convert box earlier or whatever I mentioned here, these will be affiliate links as well. Alright. So, the offer emails. These are 12, 13 and 14 Oops. This says 15, but you'll get the point here.\
\
[00:34:38.730] - Kim\
So, this is remember the special offer, I promise. Right. So, subject is PayPal notifications, anyone. And again, just like I mentioned previously, you want to reiterate that nothing beats receiving a notification of payment when you're off doing something else. What if you could learn how to attract new subscribers, take them on a path to becoming customers all through email.\
\
[00:34:58.620] - Kim\
Right. And so, what you're watching here will be a course on my site, so it will be saved on Teach.Connect.Sell here. Okay. And that'll be a discount code. Either I'll put in a coupon code or I think probably a coupon code where they can redeem it only once is probably the easiest thing to do here.\
\
[00:35:19.570] - Kim\
Email number 13. You see, this is two days after twelve. Right. And you're going to send in the morning. This is subject line, your questions answered, the content.\
\
[00:35:29.230] - Kim\
This is FAQ. This is really, really simple. We're going to be direct with this. Remind them the card is closing, but you had some questions come in about teach, connect, sell and so, write those down. Four to six questions.\
\
[00:35:41.370] - Kim\
What if I don't feel like I know how to write? Who should I use for my email service provider? So, you write the four to six questions and you write the answers. Your subject line again is your questions answered and you're going to, so, the point of this is to remove objections.\
\
[00:35:56.380] - Kim\
Right. So, you want to answer any objections in this email and remind them the cards closing and then your call to action. Click here to save and start selling with email. Email number 15, again, this is your offer email. This is still kind of answering questions, but this is direct, straightforward does not have to be long.\
\
[00:36:16.910] - Kim\
Your subject line, the cart is closing at midnight tonight, Pacific Time or whatever. Right. So, all you're going to do is remind them that your only regret. In this case, my only regret was not starting email marketing sooner, that it's the last chance to save 50% on Teach.Connect.Sell.\
\
[00:36:34.020] - Kim\
And so, again, you can use tools to do this. I would highly recommend once this starts working. You can always say, you know you can test it without it actually expiring if you want. But as this continues to grow, I would put there are too many tools out there that make this easy, like deadline funnels. So, this is going to get sent right in the evening, same day as email number 13.\
\
[00:36:57.420] - Kim\
Again, this is 14. She'll send this in the morning, send this around 05:00 p.m. And let them know. Alright. This is our follow up.\
\
[00:37:06.700] - Kim\
We're going to send a survey email and this is one week after email 14 to about 14 and 15 here. Sorry about the numbers. What you want to make sure to do is that you exclude customers. So, you want to make sure that you have tagged anybody who purchased your offer, that they do not get this. And so the subject line is, Can you do me a favor?\

[00:37:26.040] - Kim\
And this is again going to be clear and concise. It does not have to be wordy. Thank them for signing up for your free email course and then ask them to take your survey. And one suggestion is, by the way, if you take the survey, I've got another freebie for you. I've got another and I wouldn't call it a freebie.\
\
[00:37:41.730] - Kim\
But I've got another email framework for you that you'll download on the thank you page after the survey is complete, click here to take the survey. Right. And that's it, guys, that's the whole Teach.Connect.Sell in a nutshell, and I just want to drive home and reiterate that. Again, it is, my biggest regret is not focusing on email marketing sooner. It really, really, works.\
\
[00:38:07.640] - Kim\
And it's such a solid feeling in your business when you have a relationship with a list of people who want to be on the journey with you, they feel like they know you, they have a relationship with you. They trust you enough to take out their wallets and say yes, thank you. I trust you. And it is the best thing you will do for your business. And then once you get this down, once you have your lead magnet in, then you start looking at, alright.\
\
[00:38:34.220] - Kim\
Now, how do I increase list growth? How do I increase opens and of course, data changes with privacy rules and whatnot in terms of getting some of that open rate and everything. But you guys, trust me, this will be one of the best things you can do for your business. If you have any questions, just email at Kimdoyal.com. I hope this was helpful and I look forward to connecting with you.\

[00:00:13.310] - Kim\
Hey there, guys, it is Kim George here from yourchicgeek.com. And boy, am I excited to chat with you guys today and to give this presentation on how to create epic digital products that sale with Canva for passive profits. As you can see here again, I'm the founder of yourchicgeek.com.\
\
[00:00:33.970] - Kim\
And again, I'm just really excited to be here today to give you this information, so I really really hope you enjoy it. Let's get off into this presentation. Hey, as I just mentioned, this is just a little bit of information about me. I am the founder of yourchicgeek.com.\
\
[00:00:54.700] - Kim\
It is a website that I've dedicated to solopreneurs and creatives to help you guys create digital products for a passive income. I don't know about you, but there's nothing like being able to wake up in the morning after you have slept you know and to look at your phone and look at your email inbox and see that someone has someone from across the world has visited your website and bought a product from you. That's just one of the most amazing feelings in the world. And so, again, it's just something that I absolutely love to do.\
\
[00:01:26.410] - Kim\
A few things worth noting or note about me is I did graduate a long time ago with a master's in computer science, so I do come from the tech background.\
\
[00:01:37.560] - Kim\
I am a Starbucks addict. That is correct. I love Starbucks. I love their coffee, and I'm a bit of a snob when it comes to that. Also, I do love fishing.\
\
[00:01:47.400] - Kim\
This is something that me and my mom loves to get together to do. We are contra girls. And so, it's just something that I love to do. It's a favorite pastime of mine, and I told her that, yes, I do bait my own hook because I do. I wish I had a picture that I could have put here to show you guys, but absolutely love fishing.\
\
[00:02:04.830] - Kim\
And I also love all things DIY, design and tech, especially when it comes to using platforms like Canva, which has been a game changer for me, for my brand and for my business. Alright. So, a few workshop reminders, please, please, please. If you have any distractions, if you have your cell phone on and social media up or anything like that, I would ask that you please just kind of turn those off. I really want you to get as much out of this workshop or as much out of this presentation as you possibly can.\
\
[00:02:41.130] - Kim\
Also, if you have a paper and pen and you want to take a few notes, you may want to go ahead and get those out as well, because I am going to be covering quite a bit.\
\
[00:02:50.420] - Kim\
Okay, so again, I really hope you enjoy this information. Okay. So, here's a quick agenda, an overview of what you can expect to learn from this presentation that I'm going to be giving you guys today. So, number one, is we're going to talk about basically what I'm going to give you the backstory on how I was able to turn some of the ideas that I had into cash with Canva by creating digital products for passive income. Again, I didn't even know in the design world that or with Canva that some of the things that I've been able to create were possible and so, absolutely love the platform.\
\
[00:03:24.920] - Kim\
And so, we're going to talk through my backstory and leading up to selling digital products and things like that.\
\
[00:03:32.210] - Kim\
I'm also going to cover the top seven things that you need to have in place to make your digital products as irresistible as you can to your audience. I mean these are just suggestions, excuse me, in my years of creating digital products that have really helped me. And so, I'm going to be sharing those tips with you. I'm also going to talk about some tips for writing compelling headlines and product descriptions that get people excited to buy your products. I think these are some of the most overlooked things.\
\
[00:04:03.860] - Kim\
And so, I'm going to talk about that. And then we're going to cover some of the best tech platforms that you can use to sell your digital products. Plus, I'm going to give you guys some tips for marketing and promotions of your digital products and a whole lot more. So, again, this is going to be jam packed. Again, get ready, get ready.\
\
[00:04:23.340] - Kim\
Okay. So, here's a quick backstory about me and my discovery in Canva and how it's allowed me to create digital products just like the one that you see here on the screen. So, I have been online for a very long time. I had been running my website for a while. And I was doing more of the one on one kinds of work where you know I started off as a web developer. I was kind of doing websites, WordPress, websites and things like that.\
\
[00:04:51.910] - Kim\
And so I was just getting to the point where I'm like, you know what while I love the one on one work, it really would be awesome to be able to add extra revenue to the business where I didn't have to do as much one on one work where I can kind of generate income passively. And so, I started on the search on the web to kind of look for tools for design tools that I could use. And I discovered Canva, thankfully. And initially I just thought that Canva was just something that you could use just for graphic design.\
\
[00:05:24.650] - Kim\
That's it. I didn't know that you could use it to create some of the other things. Like again, this Journal that I created here, I didn't know that you could use it for that. I just didn't know. And so, as I started to use Canva and I learned it, I started to use it for way more than graphic design.\
\
[00:05:43.780] - Kim\
I started using it to create things like just different digital products and passive income products like journals, coloring books, notebooks, graphic sets, you name it. I really started to kind of get the hang of it and use it in way more advanced ways, which is super exciting for me. So, that's kind of my backstory into the world of going from just graphic design to more advanced design with passive income products. Okay. And so, I put here Canva has made it very easy for me to create all sorts of passive income products that you can sell and that I sell on different platforms that include graphic kits, which I just mentioned coloring books, journals, notebooks, branding kits, workbook templates, ebook templates.\
\
[00:06:32.820] - Kim\
You name it, pretty much anything that you want to create. If you have a little bit of creativity, you can do it with Canva. So, it really isn't all to the platform and how easy it is to use once you kind of get the hang of things. Okay. So, again, as I've grown to use Canva, it has been phenomenal for me.\
\
[00:06:54.370] - Kim\
It has changed the game for me, and I wanted to share with you guys in my years of experience of working with Canva to create you know different digital products, I want to share the steps, the seven step process that I use anytime that I go through with creating a digital product with Canva. Okay. So, here we go. So, if you're ready, let's go. I know you guys are probably familiar with this.\
\
[00:07:18.140] - Kim\
This is from Breaking Bad, which is one of my favorite favorite shows. I love it, love it, love it. So, let's go ahead and dive off into this So, step number one is to get specific, guys, really, really, really get specific.\
\
[00:07:30.980] - Kim\
And I put here at the bottom to create a product that solves one specific problem. When I first started creating products, I'm not going to lie. I just used to just put anything out there and just you know hope that it's stuck. Right. But I've learned over the years that it's better to be way more specific than just general with the products that you create and way more targeted, right?\
\
[00:07:59.200] - Kim\
It just really works better. So, here's an example that I'm using as an example for a wedding planner. So, if maybe you're a coach and you have customers that you help with planning their wedding. Instead of just creating a wedding planner for any type of bride, what you can do is you can create a wedding planner for a bride that is having a backyard wedding. So, that is way more specific and drill down than just any old wedding planner. So, if you are marketing this wedding planner for brides planning a backyard wedding, I'm sure that that would really ring and speak to that specific audience versus just any old wedding planner.\
\
[00:08:46.550] - Kim\
Now, I'm not saying that any old wedding planner would not work. But again, I just found that specificity sales. So, if you can get more specific, that tends to work out a lot better. Because if you're targeting everybody, you guys have probably heard this, you're targeting no one. So that's just an example of what I mean by just trying to get as specific as you can or solving one problem for one type of person. Okay. So, step number two is to create compelling titles for your digital products.\
\
[00:09:16.760] - Kim\
Oh, my gosh, guys. As bloggers, one of the things that we've probably heard, and you've probably heard. And I'm sure you're not in your head with this. Not in your head to this right is when you're creating a blog post, what is one of the first things that they told you to work on? It is going to be your blog post titles.\
\
[00:09:35.680] - Kim\
Yes, your blog post titles. So, just as your blog post titles are important, the same goes for your digital products. You definitely want to create a product that is going to hook you know the intended audience that you are trying to connect with. You definitely want to focus on that. So, here again, using the wedding planner as an example, instead of just doing something like the Ultimate Wedding Planner, which there's nothing wrong with that.\
\
[00:10:06.660] - Kim\
You could do something like the Ultimate Wedding Planner or the Ultimate Backyard Wedding Planner. How to plan a Stunning Wedding Budget, I'm sorry, a stunning wedding on a $500 budget. That is a great title. That is something that I would just look at and say, wow, this is very interesting. If I were a bride who I knew had a limited budget and I wanted to plan a backyard wedding on a $500 budget, which I don't even know if that's even possible.\
\
[00:10:38.080] - Kim\
But if I were planning a backyard wedding, this is a book that I would definitely be way more interested in buying because it's so targeted. It's so specific, and the title really speaks and resonates with me. Okay. So, it's just an example of something that I wanted to share, and this slide kind of just goes into that. So, again, the Ultimate Backyard Wedding Planner, how to plan a stunning wedding budget on a wedding on a $500 budget is much more specific. And I put here that this title is geared towards a specific type of wedding, which is backyard weddings.\
\
[00:11:13.490] - Kim\
It focuses on one type of bride, which is a bride that's interested in having a wedding in a backyard, and then it caters to brides that are you know maybe planning a wedding on a smaller budget. So, again, specificity and having a great title is definitely super important. Okay. Step number three is to where you can use power words in your product titles. Yes, power words in your product titles. So, power words to me are basically words that you can use, that can take your product titles from whole home and okay to oh, my gosh, I have to have this like, wow, I can't wait to find out more about what this is.\
\
[00:11:59.760] - Kim\
So, some examples of that would include Hot instead of using Hot like I used here, which is fine. You could use blazing. Instead of using pretty, you could use stunning. Instead of using beautiful, you can use appealing or visually appealing. Instead of using great, you could use sensational or instead of using awesome, you can use spectacular so on and so forth.\
\
[00:12:24.150] - Kim\
So, these are just a few examples of different power words that you can use to play up the titles of your books. And it really does work. I mean, it makes a huge difference. Okay. Step four is to make your products visually appealing.\
\
[00:12:44.530] - Kim\
Aka, make them look fabulous. I know that some people say that you shouldn't judge a book by its cover or et cetera, et cetera. With me being a DIY designer and having to kind of flail around for a couple of years to kind of make things connect with design projects that I've worked on and branding and things like that. I can tell you that the visual design and visually appealing design really does matter. It really matters.\
\
[00:13:18.630] - Kim\
I mean, think about it. It's like the first impression that people see when they see your products and if you have something. I'm sorry, but if you have a product that's looking a little sketch, people are not going to be probably as willing to want to learn more about it. Right? So, just think about it.\
\
[00:13:37.330] - Kim\
If you're on Facebook, when you're on Facebook or if you're on Instagram and you see something that jumps out at you nine times out of ten, because you know those are especially with Instagram because it's more of a visual platform. If that picture that you see is visually appealing or product that you see is visually appealing, it is going to draw you more into it. So, visual appeal definitely makes a difference. So, a couple of design tips that I have for you all, and this is really important. These are things that I had to learn over the years, took me a while to get it, and I finally did it.\
\
[00:14:13.570] - Kim\
Tip number one is to use complementary colors in your design. This just means to use colors that work well together. Now, another tip that I want to give you guys is when it comes to designing a product, any kind of products, I would just stick to two to three colors minimum. You don't have to go crazy.\
\
[00:14:32.780] - Kim\
You don't have to try to be Picasso when you're creating a product to make it look good, two to three colors and that's it. Okay, that's it. You don't have to go crazy with it. And so, one of the recommended resources that I suggest you guys check out where basically makes it super easy for you to choose color combinations because they're already put together for you is going to be color palettes.net.\
\
[00:14:58.720] - Kim\
So, definitely head over to check out that site because again, they have a plethora of color palettes there that you can use and apply to your products when you're designing them. Okay. So, tip number two is going to be use fonts that work well together. Two to three fonts max, the same with the colors two to three colors, two to three fonts. And you're good.\
\
[00:15:21.970] - Kim\
Right. A recommended resource that I would highly suggest that you all check out for font combinations if you struggle with putting fonts together is going to be fontpair.co, okay. That is a great resource that you can use. And again, much like the colorpalettes.net tool.\
\
[00:15:40.170] - Kim\
Fontpair.co basically shows you different combinations that you can use for fonts without, and it just takes the guesswork out of it. So you go there to the site, it's going to show you it's going to say, hey, here's a font. Click this to learn a font pair that you can use with this font. And it's just that simple. And then tip number three is to keep it simple.\
\
[00:16:00.320] - Kim\
And I mentioned this before. Good design does not have to be complicated. And so, the recommended resource of course, that I have for this is going to be Canva.com. And the reason that I love using Canva for design projects for creating passive income products is because Canva has already you know dozens, thousands of different templates that you can just click on, that you can change out colors, change out your fonts, add your own little designs to, so on and so forth, and you can use it to really make them your own.\
\
[00:16:32.260] - Kim\
I mean, it just makes it so easy to do that. Okay. Okay. So here are some product design examples that I have with Canva. And as you can see, you know these are simple.\
\
[00:16:47.670] - Kim\
They're not over complicated. I created all of these passive income products with Canva, and it was just pretty easy. So, you can see over here to the left, I have a workbook template set you know for people that are maybe you're a course creator that needs access to some workbook templates that you want to use for your courses. There's a set for you. I have ebook template sets.\
\
[00:17:12.520] - Kim\
And then I also have this graphic design set. And again, all of these passive income products were created with Canva. You can see that you know they all work well together. You can see that the fonts are similar. The color palette is similar.\
\
[00:17:27.620] - Kim\
So, this is just an example of product designs that can be created with Canva and very easily. Okay. All right. So step number five is to write great product descriptions. Guys, this is so important.\
\
[00:17:46.370] - Kim\
It is so, so, so, so important. So, write great product descriptions for your digital products. Super key, super important. And I'm going to go into talking about some tips on how to do this. And then I'm going to show you guys an example of what I believe is a very good and a well written product description.\
\
[00:18:06.340] - Kim\
Alright. So, some of the things that you want to include for your product descriptions are going to be features of the products. Now features and benefits are different. Features are you can kind of consider some of the more, what I'll say, the things that you can do with the product and the benefits are going to be things, the benefits that it's going to offer to the person that you're selling it to. So for an example, a feature of a notebook.\
\
[00:18:39.650] - Kim\
Let's just say a notebook, a feature of the notebook can be that maybe it's an 8.5 by 11 in size. That's a feature. Right. A benefit of the notebook is going to be you can use the notebook to take down notes. You can use it to track your appointments.\
\
[00:18:54.650] - Kim\
You can use it or use it as, you can give it to someone as a gift. You could use it to take down assignments. You can use it for all kinds of different things. That's going to be a benefit of using a notebook. Right.\
\
[00:19:09.920] - Kim\
Versus the feature is that it has a matte finish. It's an 8.5 by eleven in size or six by nine in size. Those are the features of the product. Right. So, it's really a difference, a key difference in those two.\
\
[00:19:22.250] - Kim\
All right. So, next I have who the product is the perfect fit for?. And I just mentioned that. Right. So, maybe if you're creating a passive income product, that's a notebook.\
\
[00:19:31.170] - Kim\
And maybe you're going to create a notebook for teen girls. Right. So maybe the notebook is a product fit, a great product for teen girls. And then what the product can be used to do. So, I just mentioned this.\
\
[00:19:43.940] - Kim\
Maybe you're creating a specific notebook for teen girls that helps them overcome anxiety. Or maybe you're going to create a notebook for teen girls that helps them, let's see, you know track their high school memories or something like that. Do you see? But that's way more specific. So that's an example of what the product can be used to do.\
\
[00:20:07.730] - Kim\
And then last but not least, this is very important is asking or not asking, but adding a strong call to action to your product descriptions that tell people what to do in order to get access to it. Okay. So, super important. Alright.\
\
[00:20:23.400] - Kim\
So, I have here as an example. And I thought that this was a really cute notebook that I found on Amazon. If you want to learn how to write great product descriptions, Amazon is the way to go. There's plenty of books, plenty of products out there. And so, I thought that this one was actually pretty good.\
\
[00:20:42.770] - Kim\
Okay. And so, as you can see here, this is the My Self confidence Journal for teen girls. It's created to help teen girls build confidence and boost self esteem. So, it basically just says, here are you looking for a Journal and diary that you can use for boosting self confidence, self love and self esteem for your teen girl? If so, this is the perfect resource for you.\
\
[00:21:05.060] - Kim\
This journal is the perfect gift hint for who was it for teens, twins and young women, and it's designed to help them build self confidence, think positively and encourages self esteem. That's really really good. Okay. So, we just talked about these things at the bottom. This Journal is. It has a matte finish.\
\
[00:21:27.770] - Kim\
It's eight by ten and dimensions. That's a feature. Matte Finish feature benefits. It includes daily prompts for boosting self esteem, self confidence, and practicing self love. That's a benefit.\
\
[00:21:40.540] - Kim\
It features decorative, acute journaling pages. That's a feature, that any teen will love, plus a space for adding cue stickers and writing self confidence boosting quotes for the day. That's really good. It also includes inspirational coloring pages that your teen will enjoy making their own work of art.\
\
[00:22:01.060] - Kim\
Wow, that's really a good benefit to using this journal, right? Makes the perfect inspirational notebook gifts, birthday gifts, holiday, et cetera, et cetera for ladies and teenage girls. If you're looking for a great journal for your teen that will help them build their self confidence and self esteem, and we'll encourage them to focus on what they have to offer to the world. Grab your copy today, call to action.\
\
[00:22:27.430] - Kim\
That is a really well written product description. So, this is just an example. Again, I would encourage you all to head over to Amazon and just go through some of the different books and things that they have there. I found this one, I think just by searching self confidence for teen girls or I don't know something like that. And this came up and I was like, wow, this is really really well done.\
\
[00:22:49.100] - Kim\
So, just an example here. Okay, so step six is to select a shopping cart/ecommerce platform to sell your digital products with. This is more of on the technical side of things, but this is definitely very important because you want to make sure that you have your product fulfillment in place and that it's a great product fulfillment platform that you're planning to use because take it from me. It doesn't matter if you're selling a $7 product or $700 product. If someone comes to your site and buys from you and they don't receive their purchase or they don't see it or whatever the case is, they're going to be upset.\
\
[00:23:33.630] - Kim\
Trust me, I've got emails. Hey, I don't see the product that I just purchased, can you tell me where it is and et cetera, et cetera. So, definitely make sure that your text systems are in place and that they are working as they should. Okay, so, some of the shopping cart platforms that I would ask you to consider or that are definitely worth considering are going to be, number one is Pay Hip.\
\
[00:23:57.410] - Kim\
Pay hip is one of my personal favorites. It's one that I do use right now and I'm transitioning over to this one, but it's a really great platform to use. It's free to use. It does all of the delivery for you. So, when someone comes to your site and they purchase something through the Pay Hip link that you add to your online website. Or if you just want to do a Pay Hip shop when they purchase that thing, Pay Hip is going to automatically send them their digital download.\
\
[00:24:29.210] - Kim\
And I absolutely love that because that way you know it's going to make sure that you know the purchaser or the person that's buying from you get their product that they ordered. Right. So it's going to make sure the fulfillment is good. Gum Road is another resource that I know a lot of people use. I used to use Gum Road, but I've since converted and went over to Pay Hip because again, I like the platform a lot better.\
\
[00:24:53.560] - Kim\
Sellfy is an additional one that's worth looking into. Woocommerce, I'm sure you guys are all familiar with WooCommerce. This is one of the big boys, of course, of the industry. It's been around for a long time. Woocommerce is specifically good if you are, for example, running a WordPress Shop and you want to add that ecommerce functionality to your WordPress website, right.\
\
[00:25:19.600] - Kim\
So, I have WooCommerce as well. But I do use it in conjunction with Pay Hip. Okay. And then last, but not least is Shopify. So, Shopify is notorious for the larger ecommerce stores, but it is a great platform to use if you're planning to run a large ecommerce store where you're selling a lot of passive income products and things like that.\
\
[00:25:41.480] - Kim\
So, again, these are just you know some of my favorites. A couple of these I do use. The other ones are suggestions that you can check out. And so, these are definitely some tech platforms worth considering. Alright.\
\
[00:25:56.740] - Kim\
So, step number seven is to market and promote your digital products like crazy. Listen, you've done all the work you've gone through all these seven steps, hopefully. Or the six previous steps that I've mentioned, hopefully. And now it's time to get the word out there about your products. I think this is where a lot of people kind of, I'm not gonna say fall off, but a lot of people kind of underestimate or they don't take a lot of time to put thought into the marketing and the promotion of their products.\
\
[00:26:33.780] - Kim\
It's fine. And it's great to have a product that looks really great.\
\
[00:26:40.850] - Kim\
You know the product description is great. I didn't include this, but the sale maybe you're going to create a sales page for it. The sales page is great, but if nobody knows about it, if nobody is seeing it, if you're not putting your products in front of eyeballs, then how else are you going to make the sales. So, definitely, definitely, market and promote the heck out of your digital products? Guys, when you have the opportunity to do so. So, these are a few low to no cost promotions and marketing ideas that I put together for you all.\
\
[00:27:15.580] - Kim\
These are just some of the things that I know that I've done in the past to promote products with.\
\
[00:27:21.030] - Kim\
And so, just wanted to share this with you guys. So, number one is maybe consider making product promo graphics so that you can market your digital products on social media. Social media is huge right there's Twitter, there's Facebook, there's Instagram, there is TikTok. I have not done TikTok. I've heard that it works well, I have not done it yet, but there's TikTok.\
\
[00:27:45.920] - Kim\
There is Pinterest. I don't know if I mentioned Pinterest, but there's Pinterest. There is YouTube. There's so many different ways and clever things that you can do to really get your products out there into different audiences. And if you have a budget, consider maybe even running advertisements.\
\
[00:28:05.490] - Kim\
I've done advertisements. They work very well. And so, if you do have the budget, I highly recommend looking into that as well when it comes to marketing and promoting your products on social media. Secondly, is scheduling a series of social media promo posts. So, maybe if you don't have an Ada budget, then what you can do is use a tool like buffer to set up to schedule different promotional posts.\
\
[00:28:31.350] - Kim\
Right. I've also heard that Later is a good one. I haven't used it yet, but I have heard great things about Later's platform when it comes to setting up tweets and setting up promotional posts or setting up posts that you can use or that you can put out there to social media. So that's another example of a marketing and promo idea. Number three is going to be creating a blog post about your product.\
\
[00:28:56.340] - Kim\
I've seen people do this really really well. So, create a blog post, tell people about your product what it includes, things like that. That's another way. Number four is sending a blast to your email newsletter.\
\
[00:29:07.270] - Kim\
Okay, if you have an email newsletter, definitely put it to use. I would you know err on the side of caution when it comes to blasting your email newsletter with just sale, sale, sale. Always start with value and lead with value first before you just start selling. So that's definitely something to consider. But if you do have a decent sized newsletter or email newsletter, definitely produce and let people know.\
\
[00:29:34.470] - Kim\
Hey, I have a new resource available. Here's a link to it. Check it out, et cetera, et cetera. Creating Pinterest pins that link back to your product. That is another way to get the word out about your products. And then last, but not least, this is a big one.\
\
[00:29:49.960] - Kim\
Is collaborating with other bloggers that have an audience that you want to reach. Now, sometimes you can do paid promotions to other bloggers, and sometimes you can just do a collaborative and a joint venture with other bloggers that are you know in a niche that you want to serve as well, so it can work both ways. But I always say, as I stated with the newsletter, make sure that you're leaving with value, right? You don't want to just take, take, take. You want to make sure that you're leading with value first.\
\
[00:30:20.240] - Kim\
Okay. So again, these are just some low cost marketing and promo ideas. If you want to take a picture of this, you can definitely do so. Okay, so here is a quick recap of what we've covered, and I know we've kind of gone through a lot, but I really do hope that you all have gotten some value out of what's been presented today, because again, these are things that I always consider and do when I'm creating digital products, okay, to sell. Alright.\
\
[00:30:49.960] - Kim\
So number one is create an irresistible title for your products. Again, your title, just like with the blog post, is going to determine whether or not someone looks at your products or skips over it. It's just as simple as that. So, definitely, definitely put a lot of emphasis on your product titles. You definitely want to do that.\
\
[00:31:13.230] - Kim\
Number two is to add power to your titles because they can definitely take them from a little kind of boring to more exciting and get people really excited about learning more about what it is that you have to offer. Okay. Number three is to solve one problem for one type of person. If you're marketing to everybody, you're marketing to no one. So, where possible, whenever you're creating your product, definitely try to hone in on the one specific type of person that you want to solve a problem for.\
\
[00:31:48.480] - Kim\
Okay, number four is to make your products visually appealing. And I gave you guys some tips for that, which include things like choosing great font combinations, making sure that your colors complement one another and then keeping things really simple on the design front. And, of course, using Canva or any kind of design tool that you feel comfortable with using to design and create those your products with. So, number five is to write great product descriptions. So we went through an example of a great product description that was pulled from Amazon.\
\
[00:32:21.650] - Kim\
And again, I suggest if you struggle with this, head over to Amazon and just look at some of the best sellers. Look at different books, you know look at different things and see how they have their product descriptions written to get an idea on how to write yours. Number six is to select a shopping cart platform to sell your products with. I gave you guys some suggestions for that. And then number seven.\
\
[00:32:43.510] - Kim\
Most importantly, okay, aside from the title and making a good product is to promote and market your products like crazy, right? It's one of the old things that we say is, what is it? I can't even think of the same right now, but just again, put a lot of emphasis into marketing and promoting your products. You want to let people know that this, hey, this is something that you can benefit from, et cetera, et cetera. You want to put a lot of emphasis into getting your products out there to you know get in front of as many people as you possibly can.\
\
[00:33:17.420] - Kim\
All right. Okay. So, thank you guys so so so much for attending again. I hope that this has been very helpful to you all. I hope that the information has been helpful to you all for everyone that is in attendance, you will get a free cheat sheet and guide to creating digital products that sell, irresistible digital products that sell.\
\
[00:33:41.890] - Kim\
So, please be on the lookout for this again. It's going to have a lot of the tips that we covered in this presentation, but I'm also going to be giving you some bonus information in there as well. So, you're definitely going to get access to this. And thank you so so much for listening to me, guys. I really appreciate you.

**Transcript:**\
[00:00:13.370] - Speaker 1\
Today, I want to share with you this crazy idea I had a few years back that I call the Affiliate Sales Booster page. Designed to basically do exactly what it sounds like. The whole premise is to get quick affiliate marketing wins, so money-making is fun and exciting.\
\
[00:00:29.390] \
Hi. My name is Kimi Kinsey, and if you're not yet familiar with myself, who I am, and what the heck it is I'm all about. \
\
[00:00:36.520] - Speaker 1\
I'm a wearer of many hats. Some would call me an online business strategist, a multi-passion entrepreneur, affiliate marketing nerd, or lady who just really likes to nap a lot. Whatever you call what I do, I just really enjoy throwing digital spaghetti at the wall and seeing what sticks. I like trying new things. I think it's fun, especially if it means that I can make some money doing it. \
\
[00:01:02.380] - Speaker 1\
I love monetizing, especially setting up passive income streams and just letting the bits and bob's do their thing. So where did this big idea come from? Every year around Black Friday and Cyber Monday, all of these business tools and online entrepreneurs host these amazing sales. It's kind of overwhelming, and I found that I always seemed to miss out on getting really good deals, especially for my business tools. And this sucked because these sales are a great way to reduce overhead. \
\
[00:01:36.760] - Speaker 1\
And of course, it's always nice to get education and systems and tools cheaper. I realized that if I was missing out, then there was a really good chance that my audience was too, including sales that I was hosting during those times. How could they possibly be expected to keep track of all of it? I get hundreds of emails on a regular day. Special sales only make it worse, and it's a nightmare to dig through. \
\
[00:02:06.830] - Speaker 1\
So I thought, what if someone kept track of it for them? What if I did just a bit of work for my audience? And I devised a system to help me keep tabs on sales so that I could share them with people who trust me and my judgment? Wouldn't that be so helpful?\
\
[00:02:24.390] \
So that's what I did. I built myself a way to help me keep track of sales and dates and important information so that I could share them with my email list and with my free Facebook group. But I also realized that I was likely going to get lost among the emails during all of these sales, and I needed somewhere I could send people that was just one central location, something that I could update as needed. There was no way that I could keep people up to date via email because that was just going to add to the noise. \
\
[00:02:58.110] - Speaker 1\
So I decided, I was going to create a page on my website. I used Elementor, and I immediately organized all of the Black Friday and Cyber Monday deals into little different categories to make shopping easier. \
\
[00:03:12.600] - Speaker 1\
I took the absurdity out of all of it. You didn't need to read 100 frigging emails just to find something worthy of your money. You just needed to browse them all in one location. It was stupid simple. The irony is that it actually made shopping easier for me as well. \
\
[00:03:29.480] - Speaker 1\
My audience loved it. It was successful enough for me to try it again the following year, just refining the page and learning from my experience the year before to make significant improvements to the system, especially for keeping track of all the deals and the sales. And every year that I do this and every time I refine the process, I get better at it, and I make more money than the time before.\
\
[00:03:55.840] \
Now you might be thinking this doesn't sound like anything new and you wouldn't be wrong. I don't claim to have invented the idea, but I will make claim to being the first person to implement the system that I created in a variety of ways for a variety of niches and time-sensitive shopping periods. \
\
[00:04:17.430] - Speaker 1\
You see, when I think of my favorite ways that the affiliate sales booster page really shines it's during Amazon PrimeDay, which is a two-day event where Amazon has, like a bunch of products on sale specifically for Primemembers. The PrimeDay event is yet another noisy shopping experience.\
\
[00:04:39.090] \
Now, if you're not familiar with how the Amazon Affiliate program works, it can be really difficult for bloggers to make money from, especially those who are new to blogging. The cookie is only for, like, 24 hours, meaning if someone clicks on your affiliate link, they have to make a purchase within those 24 hours for you to earn a commission. \
\
[00:05:01.120] - Speaker 1\
It's also based on the last click. So if the potential buyer clicks someone else's affiliate link after yours, you're not going to qualify for a commission and then you have to manage to get three sales in the first 180 days of being in the program or they remove you. It's tough.\
\
[00:05:21.040] \
Amazon is pretty fantastic at converting clicks into sales, but it can be a struggle for bloggers to get those clicks in the first place and then actually qualify for the commission.\
\
[00:05:33.120] \
I decided to test the system again in 2020 using Amazon PrimeDay. It worked a little differently since I couldn't plan ahead in the same way. I wouldn't actually know what was on sale until the event started, but it only took me, like a couple of hours to change a few things on my page template and then grab all of the linked images and all of the text links from Amazon. But I was literally ready the same day to send an email to my list to offer them a page of PrimeDay deals for entrepreneurs, products that I had myself that were on sale that I love and regularly use, or stuff that I just thought was an incredible deal that they might want to check out. \
\
[00:06:14.880] - Speaker 1\
I made 50 sales. This was a really big deal for new Amazon affiliates. Like I said, they have to make these three sales within the first 180 days or they get removed. \
\
[00:06:24.880] - Speaker 1\
I just made 50 sales in the span of 48 hours. Was it a ton of money? No. Was it worth it? Absolutely. Yes. Not only did I make some money for a couple of hours of my time, I now had another use for this system and I felt ready to teach it to my students as something that they could try for themselves. You might be feeling a little skeptical as to whether or not this is really useful for newbies, and your feelings are totally valid. Will it work for someone just starting out, the people who arguably made the quick win the most?\
\
[00:06:58.470] \
So I tested it again. When Amazon PrimeDay rolled around in 2021. I was so excited to test the system using a brand new website of mine that was not even 30 days old.\
\
[00:07:10.270] \
Could I take a website with next to no traffic, less than 30 people on my email list, a couple of hundred Facebook likes, and less than 100 Instagram followers, all of which I had accumulated within a few weeks before, and make the system work? And on Amazon Primeday, I spent about an hour grabbing some deals on products that someone using a low carb or keto way of eating might enjoy. \
\
[00:07:36.100] - Speaker 1\
I posted the page linked to my Facebook page, emailed my little list of 30 people, posted a few Instagram stories, and made one ridiculous tweet about my PrimeDay deals page. I made five sales.\
\
[00:07:50.430] \
Now that you've heard all about the affiliate sales booster page, what it is, how amazingly awesome it is. I do want to challenge you to try it for yourself. So I want to show you a couple of examples of ones that I have done hopefully to inspire you and give you some good ideas.\
\
[00:08:09.930] \
So, the first thing I'm going to show you here is Simply Low Carb. This one is very new. This was the first time I had ever run a page like this for this website. It was literally less than 30 days old when I tried it, and considering how new the website was and how very little traffic it was getting, I'm pretty impressed with it. It made money, which is really all anybody could possibly ever hope for. And if this were me being a brand new Amazon affiliate, I would have definitely made the three sales that I needed. So all in all, big win. \
\
[00:08:47.310] - Speaker 1\
But I'm going to kind of show you a little bit about what's here and why, and maybe give you some ideas for creating your own. Otherwise, of course, I do sell an entire training on this to give you a lot more in-depth knowledge and a lot of more behind-the-scenes type stuff. But let's take a quick look. Shall we?\
\
[00:09:09.930] \
So again, this is for Simply Low Carb. Obviously, everything here is very much about keto or a low-carb way of eating. Everything on the page is related to that. So I've broken it down into a few different categories, such as small appliances, kitchen gadgets, and supplements. People come here on the page and they can literally click to see deals that are related to each one. So for example, if I were going to click Kitchen Gadget, it's going to scroll down and show people everything that is kitchen gadget related.\
\
[00:09:45.640] \
And literally, these are all Amazon links. So you probably saw up here at the very top I have my Amazon-specific Disclaimer, very important. But otherwise, all of these are Amazon links, the images, and the buttons. And it's as simple as coming in here to Amazon, and I can come to any product. Just click on this for reference, and all I have to do is I can grab my text link. \
\
[00:10:14.030] - Speaker 1\
It's very important that you grab the full link, make sure you're getting the right tracking ID for that particular link. You can grab your whole link and you'll put that in for your button, and then you also would be able to grab just the image you never, ever, ever want to right-click and download an image from Amazon. That's a big no, no, but you can come here, grab that and again, put that in. And this is what it ends up looking like. It's very nice. \
\
[00:10:45.530] - Speaker 1\
It's really easy for people to shop from, and it takes out a lot of the noise. It gives people a really great way to shop without all of the noise of Amazon. Again, this is just an Amazon PrimeDay example. You could do this for anything. Really. \
\
[00:11:07.840] - Speaker 1\
It doesn't have to be specific to Amazon, but this is what the whole page looks like. It's mostly me giving people things that they can purchase at a discount during Amazon Primeday. There are also some nice little things here in the center. These aren't quite what you're looking for. I give people another opportunity to pick up an Amazon affiliate cookie by clicking other buttons that lead them to places that might be relevant to them. \
\
[00:11:37.530] - Speaker 1\
I also give them a place to go to support small businesses during Amazon Primeday, which I think is awesome. It looks like I have a broken image here. This page is a little bit out of date, so not surprised.\
\
[00:11:52.290] \
But otherwise I also use this as a list-building opportunity so people can come and sign up if they want to get emails from me. The next time I host this page, they can sign up for that and get alerts. I also tell people a little bit about myself and give them an opportunity to share the page. \
\
[00:12:16.950] - Speaker 1\
Honestly, again, it worked really well. I was very surprised that it worked so well for such a brand new website, but this worked great. Now, this isn't the first time I've ever done this. Normally I am in the niche of people that are entrepreneurs like myself, and so we have my PrimeDay Deals for Entrepreneurs and I have this open in Elementor so I can show you just how easy this is. I do actually also sell a template that is meant for Elementor for the free version to make this a lot easier because I know all about that page designing life and how difficult it can be. \
\
[00:12:57.390] - Speaker 1\
Same concept though. We've got my Disclaimer up here at the top and we've got a few different sections here that are related to being an entrepreneur. So things like for their office, for their home, and for their sanity.\
\
[00:13:13.110] \
One thing that I did start doing was making sure that I did things like giving people a reminder to sign up to become a Prime member. I don't know if you know this, but you can actually earn pretty good money from Amazon by getting people to sign up for Prime. Instead of it being like a few pennies for a sale, it's like $3 every time, which really adds up quickly.\
\
[00:13:39.390] \
I also gave people an opportunity to see the best deals for entrepreneurs that were under $25. So basically, I went on to Amazon and kind of filtered things down until I got things that were the best rated under $25 and was showing products specifically in the niche that made sense. And then the same concept that you've already seen. These are all just linked to products. \
\
[00:14:10.030] - Speaker 1\
So these are buttons and there are Amazon links in here. These images are just HTML, which you would grab directly from Amazon. Again with suggesting, "Hey, this isn't quite what you're looking for. You can check out these home office deals." Giving people a way to support small businesses.\
\
[00:14:37.410] \
Again, offering people an opportunity to join my community. If people wanted to get alerted the next time that I do this, people sign up for this every year. I love the fact that I can add people to my email list and let them know, hey, the new one is out and of course, a way to share the page. These work super well. This page, in particular, earns me a good chunk of money every year. Again, does not have to be for the Prime day.\
\
[00:15:07.050] \
Anyway, so I really hope that seeing this gives you some really good ideas and inspires you to try this out for yourself. It's honestly not very difficult to do. I think the hardest part, in my opinion, is actually creating the page and deciding what your deals are going to be for that page.\
\
[00:15:30.810] \
Every year, I'll usually run the event live and I'll work with some students, and I can tell you, every year the biggest question I get is, "What products do I add?" And honestly, I'm going to give you a little bit of a hint. I like to add whatever I think I would want to buy. Things that make sense to me, works perfectly fine. A lot of people are just honestly looking to spend money, which is honestly the big thing here. People are looking to spend money, and they want to know where their money would be best spent without having to dig through all of Amazon. So I like to just try to make sure that I'm choosing things that make sense, things that I already own, that's a big one for me, and things that I feel good and comfortable recommending. \
\
[00:16:24.360] - Speaker 1\
So I hope that you give this a shot. Allie is one of my favorite examples because she implemented the strategy for Amazon Prime Day very last minute. Literally, she was putting the page together the night before. She was a busy mum. She had a newborn during the Prime Day, and there was just a little time for her to be working on this. \
\
[00:16:46.150] - Speaker 1\
The only time she had available was after the baby went to bed and before she crashed herself, and she was worried that she wouldn't even have the base of her page ready in time to snag products the day of. But she breezed through it and put together a beautiful page of Prime Day deals for crafters using my Elementor page template.\
\
[00:17:05.690] - Speaker 1\
Allie only had time for sending out one email about her page to her list and sharing it once on Facebook, and that's kind of what I love about this. It doesn't take a lot of promoting. It doesn't take a big audience either, which I proved for myself. I used it on one of my new websites. \
\
[00:17:23.010] - Speaker 1\
She got over 100 sales in those two days, and you can literally see when she implemented the strategy in her analytics. That's all great. But honestly, the joy she got from it was what I loved the most! She excitedly posted in the pop-up group, showing everyone her results. And I'm so glad she's letting me share this with you, too. \
\
[00:17:43.990] - Speaker 1\
Genuinely, the best part of the system is a quick win because it's so encouraging. Finally, something is working and now she can clearly see the fruits of her labor. I'm very excited to see what you do with this, and if you do decide to give it a try, I hope you'll reach out to me and show me what you've done. \

\
**Transcript:**\
[00:00:12.360] - Leanne Chapman\
Hello, hello. I'm Leanne Chapman, if we haven't met before. You may also know me by my maiden name, Leanne Scott, as I very recently got married, so my name changed. Today, we're going to be talking about five types of passive income funnels that are going to help you to boost your sales. These funnels enable you to make income in between your launches and your flash sales. So a little bit of background about me before we dig in. So I started my career actually as a doctor, but I struggled with burnout and working really long hours and I wanted more work-life balance. So I initially started out doing some travel writing and eventually created a successful travel website, which was monetised mostly through affiliate marketing and ads. Later, I transitioned to becoming a passive income strategist, helping others to automate and streamline their own online businesses and income streams. I'm the founder of Passive Income Superstars, and I teach on topics like affiliate marketing, digital products, email marketing, sales funnels, and generally anything that helps online business owners to regain their work-life balance. So today we're going to be covering five Set and forget funnels. These include some options that you may be familiar with already, like tripwire funnels and evergreen email funnels.\
\
[00:01:24.040] - Leanne Chapman\
But we're also going to cover some newer concepts today, such as trigger funnels, affiliate funnels, and sales page funnels. And hopefully this is going to spark some ideas for you on how to generate revenue in between your own launches. But first, what even is a funnel? So a funnel is essentially a journey that you create that guides your potential customers, starting with warming them up so they start to feel like they know, like and trust your brand, and importantly, see you as a credible expert in your niche. And then the journey usually ends with a specific call to action, usually in the form of a paid offer. When we're talking about the context of sales funnels. So funnels can serve various purposes, but for our discussion, we're focussing on sales funnels, specifically evergreen funnels, that work in the background, generating passive income with minimal ongoing effort. But please know that when I talk about passive income, I do not mean easy income. I mean smart income. You'll need to do some work up front to get these funnels set up. But the payoff is that you will continue to make sales from your funnels on an ongoing basis, as long as there are leads entering the funnels.\
\
[00:02:33.360] - Leanne Chapman\
Before diving into the specifics, let's quickly discuss urgency, because I'll be referring to it throughout the presentation. Now, some people dislike urgency, feeling that it can be a little bit icky. Personally, as a customer, I actually really appreciate urgency. As somebody who's a bit of a poor decision maker, it actually helps me to make decisions faster and it prevents me from experiencing decision fatigue where I spend far too long overthinking things. And I think it's important to remember that even if you don't like countdown time as yourself, there are just as many people out there who do like them and perhaps even need them in order to make a purchase. You can, of course, make some sales without using urgency, but offering a reason to buy now usually results in far more conversions by helping people to prioritize decisions and avoid lengthy periods of indecision. Some people dislike urgency because it's sometimes used unethically. Like, for example, fake countdown timers that reset automatically or pushy tactics where sellers make people feel bad or silly for not buying their offer. However, when used responsibly, urgency can be really beneficial, especially for neurodivergent audiences who often struggle with decision making.\
\
[00:03:48.950] - Leanne Chapman\
If you are clear, you're fair, and you give a reasonable amount of time for decision making, then urgency can actually be a really helpful tool. But as with all things in business, it's your choice if you use it or not. The first funnel type we're going to look at is the tripwire funnel. So you may already be familiar with this. This is one of the most common types of funnels used in online business. This is basically where an offer is presented on a thank you page, typically after somebody joins your email list, but it can be used in other scenarios. So for example, if you submit an offer to a collaborative bundle, somebody signs up for it, you might then offer them a tripwire at that point. TripWires are an early stage offer, so products need to be low cost and easy to say yes to because people don't know you yet. So usually something priced between about $15 and $47 tends to be about the sweet spot. At this stage, your customers are just getting to know you, so expensive offers might not be quite as effective. I find that in general discounts of around 50% work really well for trip wires.\
\
[00:04:53.100] - Leanne Chapman\
So for example, a $40 offer reduced to $20 or an $80 offer reduced to $40 could work really Ensure that your tripwire offer appeals to the same person who opted in for your freebie. The offer doesn't need to be directly related to the freebie, although it can be. But if you choose something which solves another part of the same puzzle, it should be clearly different to avoid confusion. So for example, if you are a photographer and your audience wants to learn how to edit photos, you could share a guide to getting started with Lightroom as your freebie, but then you could share some Lightroom presets as the tripwire. So although it's solving the same problem, it's doing it in a different way, and they're very clearly different solutions that work well together. To create a tripwire funnel, don't start from scratch. You can just duplicate your existing sales page, add a countdown Timer, keep it really simple, tool. You can use tools like hurry Timer, which is a free plugin for WordPress users. There's the Elementor Pro's countdown Timer, or you can use ThriveCarts' built-in countdown Timer. There are advanced tools that you can use, like Deadline Funnel, which offer a lot more features, especially in terms of tracking your tripwire funnels, but they certainly aren't necessary for a basic tripwire.\
\
[00:06:08.760] - Leanne Chapman\
So I'd only really recommend investing in a tool like this if you're planning to build other types of funnels, too. So the next type of funnel is an evergreen email funnel. So these are longer multi-day funnels that are designed to warm leads up over time, eventually transitioning to sales emails. Typically, you start by attracting people with a lead magnet that appeals to somebody with the problem that your end offer helps to solve. After a warm-up sequence, you move them into a sales sequence, which can often be created by repurposing launch emails. Evergreen email funnels work best with time-sensitive discounts or bonuses to encourage quick action. Unlike trip wires, which are triggered by page views, Evergreen email funnels are triggered externally by somebody signing up to your or having a tag added to their profile inside an automation. You'll need a tool that syncs your countdown timers across your emails, your sales pages, and your checkouts to ensure that the countdown remains consistent across devices, allowing viewers to see the same Timer regardless of how and when they engage with the funnel. The tool that I recommend using for this is Deadline Funnel. There are a couple of alternatives, but not very many, and they don't tend to be quite as robust as Deadline Funnel.\
\
[00:07:33.090] - Leanne Chapman\
Another one that I've used personally is Thrive Ultimatum. I found it to be quite tricky to use, and I definitely saw better conversion rates when I switched to Deadline Funnel. And below you can see an example of how well these sorts of funnels convert. If you're really spending time to warm somebody up to you, you tend to find that the conversion rates are fairly good, which is why evergreen funnels work so well. Perhaps it's not going to work quite as well as your launch comes conversion rates because people in a launch are also saying things on social media. There's a lot of buzz, there's other people are joining at the same time. It creates a sense of excitement. So you might not get quite the same conversion rates, but you can still achieve some very good conversion rates with these types of funnels because we are pitching the offer to somebody when they are at their warmest. So for example, here was a funnel. I didn't promote it. It was completely organic. People were basically landing on blog posts that they found via searching on Google or perhaps looking on Pinterest. They were seeing a freebie, signing up for it, and then they entered my funnel.\
\
[00:08:37.910] - Leanne Chapman\
I didn't promote the freebie or mention it. It was literally just working in the background. So during that month, I had 192 people go through that funnel, generating seven sales at a price of $297. This totaled $2,079 in revenue. And you can see this can be really quite lucrative because it's a hands-off approach. So you could still be out there launching other products, doing other things that make you money, like offering services or creating new offers, that this is all additional income that you wouldn't have made otherwise because you're not going to be doing back-to-back flash sales. The next one we have is affiliate funnels. So funnels don't always have to promote your own products. If you don't have very many products yet, you can promote other people's products and earn a commission on the sale, or you can do this to supplement your income and your sales from your other funnels. If somebody clicks on your link and purchases through it, you're going to earn a commission if you join that affiliate program. When doing this, I recommend focusing on higher commission programs or those with recurring commissions. There's quite a lot of work that goes into creating an affiliate funnel, so you don't want to do it just for a few dollars per sale.\
\
[00:09:53.140] - Leanne Chapman\
So I would stick to affiliate programs where you earn a significant amount for each commission or you are receiving a recurring commission each month. So for example, if you're promoting somebody's membership, you might earn a commission every month the person stays in the membership. And if they stay in the membership for, say, two or three years, you're going to earn commission every single month for that period of time. And it really does add up. Here, you do something similar to setting up an evergreen funnel for your own product sales. You'd create a lead magnet that attracts the same audience, and then you place it on your blog post that are focused on promoting those products. Those posts might be product reviews, product comparisons, buying guides, how-to guides. And then readers of these articles are likely to be really interested in the product that you're promoting. In fact, to the point that they've actually gone and searched for a product review or a product comparison. So you're going to be advertising your lead magnet on these pages, knowing that it's going to attract the same person. Then you're going to send them through some warm-up emails.\
\
[00:10:50.140] - Leanne Chapman\
In these emails, you're not just warming somebody up to you as the expert, you're also introducing them to the products available. Then you proceed with your sales emails. For instance, you You might share case studies, research studies, comparisons with other popular products. You could address some FAQs or some common objections, essentially using a similar approach as promoting your own offers. Creating urgency in affiliate funnels can certainly be harder, but it's not impossible. It's a more advanced strategy. So if you're just getting started, then you might want to just create some of these funnels without urgency. However, you could create urgency by offering an extra bonus if they buy within a specific time frame, and then you can deliver that bonus if you can verify that they purchase soon after your email. You can usually just check this inside your email service provider. For example, I use Kit, which used to be Convert Kit, and I can click into somebody's email address and see when they last received the email, so I know whether they purchased within a funnel and I can offer them the bonus. Another way is to refer people to a freebie that locks in your affiliate cookies.\
\
[00:11:56.740] - Leanne Chapman\
So many affiliate programs, especially digital ones, offer freebies through affiliate links. So if you refer somebody to the freebie, you're still going to earn commission if they purchase later in the funnel period. So essentially somebody else is doing all the hard work setting up that funnel and all you're having to do is refer people to the free stuff. For brands with whom you have a strong affiliate relationship and have generated numerous sales, you could consider reaching out to see if they would offer your audience a discount code. This definitely is going to involve some work on their end. And if you want to use countdown timers on the offers page, then it's going to be a bit more work for them to set up. So I would usually reserve this for affiliate programs where you're doing really well and you think that the affiliate manager is going to want to really support you to continue to make more sales. Next, we have trigger funnels. So this is where you can send people into funnels once they're already subscribed to an email list based on their click behavior. So when you send newsletters, you might casually mention products linking to them.\
\
[00:12:57.490] - Leanne Chapman\
And when somebody clicks on those links, you can add a tag like, like interested in X product, which then triggers an automation sending them into a mini sales funnel. This funnel could include additional product information. It could include a case study, a bonus offer, encouraging them to make that purchase decision. For your own offers, you might want to use something like deadline funnel again to add that urgency and make it a bit more like an evergreen sales funnel we talked about earlier, but targeting people who've already shown an interest. This can be challenging to replicate for affiliate products, but it's not always necessary to do. I do recommend using a do not disturb tag when you set up these funnels. So when somebody enters the funnel, the tag gets added. This way, they won't receive other emails or newsletters because you can exclude them when you send a newsletter. This just ensures that they don't feel overwhelmed by too many emails at once. Then you can just set the automation to remove the tag once they travel through the sales sequence. They go back to receiving all your regular emails. Finally, we have sales page funnels.\
\
[00:14:06.400] - Leanne Chapman\
So these mini funnels function a bit like trip wires. So visitors to your sales page might arrive through, say, an email link or browsing your website, But then when they arrive on the sales page, a pop-up could offer them a discount if they opt in to your email list. So you could deliver the discount via a coupon code in the welcome email, though there is no reason to buy now with this method, so it doesn't always work quite effectively. Alternatively, you could use a tripwire page with a short time frame, like say 24 hours, and then you could follow up with a reminder email within that 24 hours. If you use Deadline Funnel, you can set up a proper funnel that includes urgency from the start. Essentially, it's just like an evergreen sales funnel, but it's triggered by somebody joining your email list, specifically to get a discount coupon. Creating funnels requires some tools, and which tool you need depends on which type of funnel you're planning to set up. Deadline Funnel is the best for adding urgency to longer funnels, such as evergreen or trigger funnels. Though it's an investment, it typically pays for itself many, many times over.\
\
[00:15:16.430] - Leanne Chapman\
For those who are just starting with lower-tick products, you may use something like HurryTimer, which is a free countdown plugin that works on WordPress, works absolutely fine for things like tripwire offers. For email service providers, I usually recommend Kit, formerly called Convert Kit, due to its excellent automation workflows, but most email service providers will allow you to set up these types of funnels. If you use tools like Elementor or Thrivecart, they offer built-in countdown timers for trip wires. I think with Elementor, it has to be the pro version in order to get the countdown Timer, but that's certainly an option. I also recommend Convertbox for doing the sales page discounts. They create visually appealing non-intrusive pop-ups, allowing you to control when and to whom the pop-up's display. So it's probably the best tool for creating those pop-up notifications to create sales page funnels. So which type of funnel should you be using? Well, this depends partly on your tools and also on your budget. Generally speaking, for low-ticket products, focus on trip wires and simple trigger funnels. For high-ticket products, such as those priced a few hundred dollars or more, an evergreen email funnel works really well as these involve a little bit more nurturing, which gives you an opportunity to sell something that costs a little bit more money.\
\
[00:16:40.520] - Leanne Chapman\
You can also set up trigger funnels, and you can also add urgency to those trigger funnels to really help boost conversion rates. And you can also do sales page funnels. For higher priced, say, group programs that are, say, four figures or more, an evergreen email funnel is going to be essential. Use Deadline Funnel for higher-priced trigger funnels as well to add urgency. You can also use trigger funnels and sales page funnels for your very high ticket products. And for affiliate products, you would consider using either affiliate or Trigger Funnel. So hopefully you found this talk about five types of passive income funnel useful and it sparked some ideas for you. I do have a free Funnel Guide, Fantastic Funnels, which you are able to download. It covers all five of the funnels that we talked today. Plus there is a workbook for you to start planning out some of your own funnels. Plus I've included the exact emails from one of my successful evergreen sales funnels. So you can see how I plan it out, how I nurture people towards making a sale. I also share a creative strategy every week with my email list for Strategy Sundays.\
\
[00:17:52.360] - Leanne Chapman\
So if you enjoy today's ideas, you should get plenty more inspiration there. Thanks so much for listening today and hopefully I will catch you in the inbox.\

**Transcript:**\
[00:00:10.040] - Leanne Scott, passiveincomesuperstars.com\
Hi there, my name's Leanne, and I am here today to teach you about affiliate marketing and I'm going to be teaching you today about ethical affiliate marketing. So, how to be strategic and get results, but without being sleazy.\
\
[00:00:25.770] - Leanne\
So, a little bit about me, so my name's Leanne and I based in Cardiff in the U.K. and I ran two successful websites. So, I started out as a travel blogger, which is where I started learning my affiliate marketing strategies. I'm going be teaching each day. And now I also have a website called Passive Income Superstars, where I also host the course affiliate Marketing Super star. So if you're interested in learning more about affiliate marketing, then stay with me, because at the end of this presentation, I will offer you a discount code for that as well.\
\
[00:01:00.750] - Leanne\
So, I'm all about passive income. I'm not a big fan of sort of sending endless cold pitches to brands. I don't like working to other people's deadlines. And so affiliate marketing really suits me. And and that's why I love it so much. I'm going to tell you a little bit more about that in a moment. In my spare time when I'm not working on my website. Then you'll usually find me traveling somewhere. I really enjoy photography, do a bit of swimming and dancing as well. Although to be fair, most of those hobbies have been on hold for a little while to covid and a little random fact about me.\
\
[00:01:33.780] - Leanne\
So, I was once slapped in the face by a wild eagle. And if you want to know more about that story, then you'll have to ask me over in the Facebook group.\
\
[00:01:42.030] - Leanne\
So, let's talk about affiliate marketing. So, affiliate marketing. We're going to start with the absolute basics, because it might be that some of you that are watching this have never tried it before. So, what is affiliate marketing. But essentially it is a type of word of mouth marketing. So, that means that you try a product and if you have a good experience with it, then you recommend it to your audience. And if they go on to make a purchase, then you earn a small commission or a referral fee for offering that person. Now you will only get paid if that person goes on to make a sale. And therefore, because of that, it's a very low cost, risk free type of marketing for brands and businesses.\
\
[00:02:25.240] - Leanne\
So, why is it marketing so great? Well, firstly, it's a form of passive income, so that means that all the work that you're doing now can continue to earn money for the next weeks, months or even years. And so for that reason, when people talk about making money in their sleep, that's true. It doesn't mean that they're not working for it. They're doing the work, but they're continuing to see results long term. And that's one of the great things about affiliate marketing, because it means that your business will continue to grow and that business can grow exponentially.\
\
[00:02:56.260] - Leanne\
There's no ceiling with affiliate marketing. So, if you were relying on work with brands in order to make an income, then there is some limitations. So, for example, even though you can raise your fees, there is a limit as to how much you can charge. And also there's a limit as to how much work you can take on. Whereas with affiliate marketing you just take on as much as you want. But like I said, because all of those articles that you've already written or already circulating, your business can grow and grow and grow and there is no ceiling for how far that can go.\
\
[00:03:29.260] - Leanne\
Also, the fact that you can be 100% authentic and retain your audiences trust is super important. So, one of the things that I felt uncomfortable about working with brands was that you made an agreement before you'd experienced a product, and if you didn't really enjoy using that product, you feel obliged to say positive things about it because you've got a financial arrangement between you and that brand. And that just didn't sit right with me. I wanted to always be honest about my experiences. And so affiliate marketing was a great way to do that because I'm only promoting products that I already have experience with.\
\
[00:04:04.000] - Leanne\
Also, I mention I'm not very good at deadlines. I like to I like to work to my own timetable. And for that reason, I think marketing is brilliant. It means that if a friend wants to go for coffee, you can just put down work and go out without worrying about hitting the deadlines. You can just come back to the article the next day.\
\
[00:04:23.530] - Leanne\
And so it's great for that work/life balance, which I think a lot of people go into blogging in order to find.\
\
[00:04:31.960] - Leanne\
Also, it doesn't require huge page numbers. So lots of people think that you need to have huge page numbers in order to be successful with affiliate marketing. That's just not true. It does certainly help, however, is much more important that you get the right people to see your articles rather than just lots of them. We'll talk about that in a moment.\
\
[00:04:55.270] - Leanne\
So, occasionally affiliate marketing does get a bit of a bad reputation, and the reason for that is that there are some affiliate marketers out there who will say anything to land a sale and who might promote products based on the commission rates rather than based on their true experiences. A classic example is there's a particular hosting company that is sort of well known amongst bloggers as being not the best. Sometimes that leads to slow websites, but they have a very, very good commission structure for affiliates. And as a result, there are lots of people who promote it to new bloggers. And as a result, there are lots of people are very disappointed when they realize that their website is slow because of their host and they have to change later on. So, that's what I want to avoid. And I think we do have to accept there will always be bad eggs in every single business. However, it's our responsibility to show that affiliate marketing can be ethical and it can be positive and it can be good for all three parties involved. So, for example, a brand will get low cost risk free marketing. You can build a passive income business and your followers and your readers will find out about products that they perhaps didn't know existed, that hopefully going to go on to make improvements in their quality of life.\
\
[00:06:14.870] - Leanne\
So, how does affiliate marketing work? So basically, you start off by building an audience now that audience doesn't have to be a blog readership. It could also be an email list. It could be a social media channel. As long as you have an audience that you can reach and influence than you can and join up to affiliate programs. So, you then join an affiliate program or network and you're given a link that's unique to you with a tracking idea on the end of it. You could then use this link in your blog post or email, your social media posts and and even then you Pinterest pins. And then if somebody clicks on that link, even if they click on it, say a couple, they click on it, but don't buy for a couple of weeks.\
\
[00:06:59.390] - Leanne\
They are tracked by something called cookies. And as long as they are, they buy the product within the cookie period, then you will be rewarded. A commission as a thank you for offering that sale.\
\
[00:07:15.210] - Leanne\
So, today, I really wanted to focus in on what I'm calling today a heart centered approach to affiliate marketing. What I mean is an ethical feel good approach, and that really does start with understanding who you can help and how you can go about helping them.\
\
[00:07:34.350] - Leanne\
So, I always start by creating an ideal reader in my mind. So this ideal reader or some people call them avatars, is somebody that you need to be thinking of every single time that you write an article and every single time that you write an email or even a social media post. And sometimes it's useful to actually give them a name as well, because if they've got a name, they feel a little bit more real and that will help you with your writing.\
\
[00:08:00.870] - Leanne\
So, before you decide what you're going to promote, you want to ask yourself lots of different questions about this ideal reader. And so ask yourself, how old are they? Where do they live? Do they have children? Are they married or single? What do they enjoy? What do they not enjoy? Do they have any pet peeves? Is there anything that really annoys them? What worries them? What their plans or their goals for the future? And what problems do they have at the moment that they need solving? And also with those goals, are there any roadblocks stopping them from achieving them? So, if you ask yourself all of these questions, you can then go on to ask yourself if there's any products that you've used to solve similar problems that you can recommend to them to help them with their roadblocks as well.\
\
[00:08:44.580] - Leanne\
So, affiliate marketing is essentially all about problem solving, and that's one of the things that I think a lot of people don't realize. So, usually what happens is bloggers will write an article and then they will look back through and see if they can add any affiliate links. However, they find then that they don't convert very well, and that's because they haven't started with the problem. So, you have to start with the problem before you even write the article. You need to start with thinking about how you can go about solving it and how you can reach that person when they're ready to make a purchase. And if you do that, you will start to see improvements in your conversions with your affiliate links.\
\
[00:09:27.730] - Leanne\
So, what we're going to do is going to have a look at a couple of fictional characters or avatars. And then I'm going to show you how you can help them with affiliate products.\
\
[00:09:35.860] - Leanne\
So, we're going to start with Clare. Clare is married, she is 32 and she's got a three month old baby. And prior to having a baby, she was enjoying keeping fit and meeting her friends for coffee. But currently she's just absolutely exhausted. Babies not sleeping, she's not sleeping. And as a result, she's just too tired to enjoy the things that she normally does. And she's worried that she's missing out on her baby growing up because she's too tired to enjoy it. So, products that could potentially help clear out products that will help her baby sleep better and therefore help her through the first few months of being a mom. So, something like perhaps a baby yoga class or sleep training course.\
\
[00:10:14.280] - Leanne\
The next person I want you to meet is Anna. So, Anna is single, she's twenty. She's on the career ladder and she's currently working from home due to covered. And prior to covid she was pretty fit and healthy. She enjoyed some contact sports, such as playing netball. She enjoyed eating out. She usually pretty health conscious when she goes out, chooses the healthy things off the menu. However, currently she can't play sports and due to social distancing, she's working longer hours as a result of a lot of her colleagues being sick and as a result, she doesn't have time to cook. And so she's finding that she's ordering more takeaways. And as a result, she noticed that her health is suffering. So, the sorts of products that could potentially help Anna might be products that help her exercise at home, the home fitness equipment or home fitness programs. It could be products that help her to eat healthier and more healthily. So, it might be healthy food delivery services or it could be a course or an eBook that helps her to make healthy meals quickly.\
\
[00:11:18.950] - Leanne\
So, before we can work out how to help avatars Anna and Claire with their problems, we need to understand the brain funnel or the sales funnel. So, the idea is that people move from unaware to product aware for various stages. And this process can happen very quickly over, say, 30 minutes or an hour if it's a low cost product or it can take a lot longer. So, when somebody becomes aware of a problem, they don't know how to resolve it. Their problem aware. And then they become aware of various solutions, but they haven't decided on a specific solution at that point they are solution aware and then they go on to become product aware and they have to then decide whether that product is right for them. And so they do research on that specific product.\
\
[00:12:12.710] - Leanne\
So, the closer somebody is to the end of that buying funnel, the easier it will be to get to see conversions. So, if you were reaching somebody when they're only just problem aware that probably not ready to make a purchase and therefore you might not see the conversions to try to reach people when they are solution and product elsewhere. Also, if you are promoting higher ticket products that may cost hundreds or thousands of dollars, it's going to take somebody a lot longer to work through that funnel. So, again, you really need to be focusing on reaching people towards the end of that funnel.\
\
[00:12:50.960] - Leanne\
However, if it's a low cost product, then you may have more success reaching people at the start of the funnel because it doesn't take quite as long to to work through that process.\
\
[00:13:03.620] - Leanne\
So, if we go back and look at Clare's journey, so Clare is our new mum and she's been feeling exhausted, but she's just presuming that it's normal for new mums. So, she then reads a blog article called "What to Expect in your first Six Months as a New Mum". And she realizes during the article that though it's pretty normal to feel tired, perhaps her baby could be sleeping better than she is. And so as a result, she wants to try and improve her baby's sleep. So she's now problem aware. So, she goes on to read an article called "10 Ways to Improve Your Baby Sleep Pattern". And at that point, she starts to think about courses or products that could help her baby sleep better. And now she might be searching for something like the best sleep training courses for new babies. And then she becomes aware of a couple of different courses and she now has to decide which is the right one for her. So she's product aware and she might start to search for things like, say, course A or B.\
\
[00:14:05.700] - Leanne\
Now, if we look at Anna's journey, so Anna is currently on lockdown and feels that her health is suffering. So, she starts off by reading an article called "10 Ways to Get Healthier to beat Covid". And she realizes that she really should be trying to pack some more nutrients into her diet. She's not quite sure how because she's really busy. She's working all hours. She doesn't have time to be cooking elaborate meals. So she reads an article called "10 Benefits of Daily Fruit Smoothies". And she thinks actually that's a really good idea, that she can cram a lot of nutrients into her breakfast. And it's something that can be created pretty quickly. So, it seems like a good solution to her. So, she now starts to search for articles like "How to Make Fruit Smoothies". And in the article, a blender, a particular blender is mentioned. So, she now has to decide whether that blender is the one that's worth spending the money on. And so she might be searching for things like a particular blender. You.\
\
[00:15:03.100] - Leanne\
So there's lots of different articles that you can write to convert affiliate sales, but again, keep in mind that you want to be reaching people when they either solution or product aware. So, for example, a product to review or comparison a product tutorial, if it's like a digital product, you can do like a video walk through of a product or interviews with a product owner. They are all going to reach people when they're already product aware.\
\
[00:15:30.970] - Leanne\
A point on the interviews is that it's difficult to get traffic to these sorts of articles so people don't tend to be searching for an interview. However, they can support other articles. And also, if you've got a big social media following or you've got a very engaged email list, then something like a an interview with a product owner or somebody that's affiliated with that product, like a marketing manager or somebody like that, can actually be really useful. Because what you're doing is helping your reader come to know, like and trust the the product owner as well as yourself. And therefore, they are more likely to make a purchase from a product where they know a little bit more about the background and who created it.\
\
[00:16:14.470] - Leanne\
I've also mentioned here product listicle. So that's the sort of top 10 style articles or how to guides as well, where you use an affiliate product as part of the solution. Also gift guides or special offer round ups and parking lists if you're in the travel niche. So, these are more for people who are solution aware and reaching people just slightly higher up in that buying funnel. But you could still converse in sales and often these sorts of articles might actually have high search volumes of Googles. You might get more traffic or the conversion rates will be slightly lower than those articles, like a product review or product comparison.\
\
[00:16:56.100] - Leanne\
So, when you are thinking about the keywords to target, keep in mind that buying funnel and think about what sort of terminology you would use if you were looking for a product to solve a specific problem and and then use that to do some keyword research. And the important thing with Keyword research is it's not about the page search volume. So, for example, if there's a search volume for keyword of, say, 100, but it's a keyword that shows high buying intent, I would always target that one rather than a keyword that perhaps has a thousand search volume. However, it doesn't show much. Buying is reaching people much higher up in that buying funnel when they're not ready to make a purchase. So, just make sure that you keep that in mind and keep an open mind, even when a keyword doesn't look like it has a lot of people searching for it.\
\
[00:17:51.060] - Leanne\
So, for example, one of my keywords gets while the the article gets in 75 times a month, which isn't a lot. However, that particular article over about 18 months made two and a half thousand dollars. So if I had excluded that because the search volume was so low, I think the search volume was actually lower than that because the same ranking for a few different keywords, search volume was only about 10 or 15. But I'm ranking number one for that. So, I picked up a few low volume keywords. And those 75 people that landed my article are very, very likely to go ahead and make a purchase. So it's really important that your readers come to know, like and trust you.\
\
[00:18:36.210] - Leanne\
So, you need to stay authentic, only promote products that you genuinely believe in. But also if you get the opportunity to convert a reader into a subscriber or somebody to follow you on social media, then you've got an opportunity to nurture your relationship. And then you can come back to promoting these affiliate products later on down the line when they've had time to get to know you.\
\
[00:18:58.080] - Leanne\
However, when you are writing a blog article and somebody is perhaps reaching you towards the end of that funnel, they're going to make a purchase quite quickly and they don't have time to get to know you. So, there are certain things that you can do within a blog article that do help to build that. No, like a trust factor. So, for example, be really open about your level of experience with the product. So, if you've got experience, talk about your personal feelings about it.\
\
[00:19:25.800] - Leanne\
And if you don't have experience, if perhaps you've done a sort of critical review of a variety of products talk about your methods and talk about why you're qualified to review those products.\
\
[00:19:37.680] - Leanne\
Explain why you think a product is valuable. Don't just tell people something's amazing that you should definitely buy it. You've got to give somebody a reason. So, talk about why that product stands out compared to other products. Is there anything in particular that made you choose over something else? And what are the pros and cons of that product? So, be very, very specific.\
\
[00:20:02.370] - Leanne\
And don't be afraid to say negative things. Sometimes I think it looks really suspicious if you read a blog article where everything is positive and every single product they mention is amazing. That sounds to me a little bit sales. Whereas if you are very open and say, well, this product I really liked for this reason. However, there is a slight problem and you talk about one of the negative aspects, but you can perhaps even turn that into a positive by talking about how you can work around that issue or perhaps that issue actually doesn't really matter that much. And you could talk about that, or you could give another alternative where the alternative solves the problem from the from the previous product.\
\
[00:20:43.710] - Leanne\
Also, when you are writing these articles, don't get too formal. Instead, keep it very conversational. So, talk to them like they're your friend. And and also think about affiliate marketing like you would promoting a product to somebody that you know. So, if you wouldn't feel comfortable promoting a product to your best friend, then you shouldn't be writing an article about it either. So, just always keep that in mind and ask yourself, you know, how would I promote this to my friend and would I promote this to my friend?\
\
[00:21:13.890] - Leanne\
And then finally, if there is a way to get somebody onto your email list or to follow you on social media, then do try to do that, because they might not be ready to buy now, but they might be later on after you've had chance to nurture that relationship. So, perhaps offering a freebie like a like a cheat sheet that they can download or something that's relevant to the finished product or to the problem that if that product sells, will hopefully get them onto your email list and then you can come back to promoting the product a bit later on down the line.\
\
[00:21:45.970] - Leanne\
So, there's lots of different affiliate networks to join, so for example, Awin, Shareasale, Commission Junction or some of the biggest, and when you join a network, you're essentially paid directly from the network rather than individual programs, but you still have to join individual programs. So, it just basically keeps everything nice and organized so that you can see at a glance which programs are working, which aren't.\
\
[00:22:09.820] - Leanne\
Amazon Associates is a really popular program. There are so many different products that almost any nation can benefit from Amazon. And the only problem with it really is that there are low commission rates and there's also lots of rules to follow, as well as the possibility of of getting thrown out if you if you accidentally break one of the rules. However, that said, Amazon are really good at selling. So, you can refer somebody for ten dollar product. But chances are that Amazon will offer them lots of related products before they reach the checkout. And so often, even though you're referring to somebody for ten dollar product, they might pick up some of the things that they need at the same time. And then you get rewarded for the full value, which might be five or 10 times the amount that you offer them for.\
\
[00:22:59.980] - Leanne\
Essy is a great program and it's got a 30 day cookie period. And it's really good for almost every niche, but for things like gift guides.\
\
[00:23:09.250] - Leanne\
Skimlinks is a good network for beginners. So, Skimlinks, you join the network, you don't have to join individual programs. Instead, it will scan your website and find lots of different links and convert them to affiliate links for you, which is great for say, for example, you only mentioned a product once or twice, so it's not worth joining the program, but you might possibly pick up at the occasional sale here and there. So, it's great for sort of mopping up those sales. It's also really good for if you are slightly new, a blogger and perhaps you get rejected from an affiliate program and so you can via Skimlinks and you can start earning money with them straight away.\
\
[00:23:50.020] - Leanne\
The final one I wanted to mention is Ultimate Bundles. So, Ultimate Bundles is slightly different. So they sell bundles of digital products; so courses, eBooks, templates, memberships, things like that. And they've got these bundles for a huge range of niches. So, there are bundles for healthy eating, gardening, photography, home schooling, loads of different things. You may already be familiar with the Genius Bloggers Toolkit, which is one of those bundles, and that one specifically for bloggers.\
\
[00:24:21.220] - Leanne\
Now, these sales are open, close cart sales, which means that they're only available for a very short period of time. However, they tend to be very heavily discounted. So they tend to be a little bit easier to promote because they've got that sort of little element of urgency that sort of makes people make decisions. I think a lot of us are bad decision makers. I know I certainly am and often just need that little prod in order to make me decide whether or not I want something. So that's where Ultimate Bundles comes in and it's got quite high commission rate as well. So, you can earning anywhere between 40 and 70 percent commissions, which are huge. So, definitely check out Ultimate Bundles.\
\
[00:25:07.610] - Leanne\
So, there's lots of different places you can use your affiliate links, doesn't just have to be in your blog post, so within your blog posts you can use and deep links, you can use buttons. I like to use a bright colored button for really clear call to action. Like click here to check up to date prices. You can even turn images into affiliate links. You can use tables. Tables are a Great Decision-Making tool which will increase conversion rates. So definitely consider using some there and you can also consider using widgets as well. Although I personally don't like widgets, I find that less people click on widgets, I think probably because they look a little bit like ads. And so as a result, people will often just skim over them.\
\
[00:25:47.000] - Leanne\
And there are other places on your blog. So for example, your home page or category, page or about me page, which is probably one of your most visited pages on your website, obviously your resources page and also in your sidebar as well.\
\
[00:26:02.090] - Leanne\
On Facebook, you can promote links and on your page or within your group or potentially other groups if it's allowed. You always need to check the rules. And often Facebook group owners so that you link to an article rather than a direct link. And also, potentially you can use paid ads on Facebook as well.\
\
[00:26:22.760] - Leanne\
On Instagram, you've got the link in your bio and you can use a smart bio link or something like that. You can use to swipe up feature if you've got over ten thousand followers and you can talk about your everyday products and your storage captions and your reals.\
\
[00:26:37.760] - Leanne\
On Pinterest you've got a few different options. You can use an affiliate link and link directly to a product. So, they don't actually go anywhere near your website. You do need to mark that as an affiliate link. And you also need to check the terms and conditions of the program to make sure that they allow that. You can also link to your articles that are affiliate articles and you can also link to any pages you've got for promoting your lead magnet's to get somebody onto your email list and then you can set up an email funnel that goes out to them over a period of time promoting products.\
\
[00:27:13.460] - Leanne\
YouTube videos and Podcast. You need to use a link shortener, so that your links are nice and easy to remember that when you're talking about them, somebody can remember how to find that link. And you can also link to your affiliate links in your show notes or in your descriptions.\
\
[00:27:28.750] - Leanne\
And finally on Twitter, if you decide to use it, links there, make sure that you do tag the company. So, I've done that before where a company has then shared my affiliate link and I've gone ahead and had quite a lot of money because all of the people that they are sharing it to, their entire audience, already interested in the product and therefore conversion rates will be quite high.\
\
[00:27:55.110] - Leanne\
Let's talk about the legalities, because this is something that often confuses people and puts people off starting affiliate marketing. So, there's just a few important things to remember. So, firstly, your feelings need to be marked as sponsored links. It used to be that they just had to be no-follow. But now Google does prefer them to be marked as sponsored. You need to make sure that you are disclosing everything as an affiliate link. So, on a blog post the FTC likes to see a disclosure of both your video link and also they don't want it to be too far away. So if you've got a really long article, then it might not be enough to have a disclosure just at the top of your post. You might want to add one at the bottom or there is a tool that I use first affiliate, which adds automatic disclosure so that all of my clients have a tiny little I just above the link. And when you hover over the link to click on it, there is a little notification thumbs up saying it is an affiliate link. Not everybody uses that, but it does mean that you are completely covered.\
\
[00:28:56.460] - Leanne\
There is also a plug in that I use called the FNTC plugin, which is basically an easy way to add an automatic disclosure above your articles. So, it puts the disclosure above your social share buttons. And that way the information about your affiliate links doesn't get included in the first 100 words of your article, which can sometimes impact on your SEO. So, it's much better to have it above those social share and not included in that.\
\
[00:29:25.770] - Leanne\
You'll also want to have a slightly more detailed disclosure on a legal page where you talk about cookies, and about how you will earn a commission if somebody goes ahead and purchases a product.\
\
[00:29:43.350] - Leanne\
So, link cloaking is something that not everybody does, but I highly recommend doing it. So, basically link cloaking means that you take your normal affiliate link, which is usually a really sort of ugly string of numbers that you're never going to remember. And you can turn it into a branded link that is short, neat and easy to remember, so that if somebody asks you for your affiliate link, perhaps you're in a Facebook group and you recommended a product and somebody asks you if you have a link for it, then you can give them the link straightaway. It also means that if the company changes their products well and changes their site structure so that the link changes slightly, you don't have to go back through your whole website looking for all the links to correct them. All you need to do is change it once within your library and it changes instantly across your whole site. So, that's going to save you an awful lot of time. And also it makes it easier for finding affiliate links as well, because you can access your library of affiliate links within your WordPress dashboard while still creating an article.\
\
[00:30:48.240] - Leanne\
So, the link cloaking tool. I use is called Thirsty-Affiliates Affiliates. There are other ones out there, like Pretty Links. But First Year is the one I use and I've always enjoyed using it, I recommend it. So, to give you an example of what a cloak link looks like, this is my link for Thirsty-Affiliates. So, as you can see, it's the name of my website, SEO. Passive income superstars.com/recommends/ Thirsty-Affiliates.\
\
[00:31:13.800] - Leanne\
So, all of my affiliate links will then follow the same structure. So, all of them have the name of my website, followed by recommends, followed by the name of the product.\
\
[00:31:27.630] - Leanne\
I want to talk a little bit about affiliate emails, because I think this is one of the things that a lot of bloggers find really difficult. When I asked my Facebook group about what their biggest struggles with email marketing were, lots of them told me they didn't know how to monetize their email list and they didn't feel comfortable using affiliate links within their emails. And I think that that's partly because when you were building an email list, it's difficult enough to get somebody to join your list and then to open your emails. The last thing you want is for them to unsubscribe. And so I think this makes people very nervous about using affiliate links and the emails, but it's actually a really effective way of doing affiliate marketing. But you just need to follow a few rules in order to make sure that you're doing it in the right way.\
\
[00:32:13.680] - Leanne\
So, firstly, I like to follow the 80-20 rule. So what I mean by this is that 80% of what I send to my email list is all about value and only 20% is about sales. So, it might be that more of my emails are just about promoting tips, but it could also be that a specific affiliate email still carries a lot of tips in it. And then an affiliate product, as mentioned towards the end of the email. That's another way of doing it. But basically, just make sure that you're not making your whole email list and email marketing strategy about sales, but that you are adding value to somebody.\
\
[00:32:51.960] - Leanne\
Also segment your list. So what I mean by that is to create either groups or segments, depending on which email platform you use to show what somebody is interested in. So, what you can do is add attacked them every time they join via a certain lead Magner or every time they interact with one of your emails, you can add a tag that adds them to a segment which just helps you understand your email subscribers a little bit better. So, for example, I have segments for beginner bloggers and advance bloggers and I don't send the same recommendations to each.\
\
[00:33:29.370] - Leanne\
And this just means that, say, for example, if I had a segment on my email list of bloggers interested in Pinterest and then perhaps Tailwind, we're running a special offer. I could message just my followers that I know are interested in Tailwind and not annoy the rest who perhaps don't want to use a tool like that. And that's fine. I also like to offer an opportunity to opt out promotional email.\
\
[00:33:56.500] - Leanne\
So, every now and then I will do a promotion over a period of time when a product is only available for a short period of time or a company is having a sale or something along those lines. I'll want to send more than one email that week about it. So, what I do is on every single email that I send, I include a sentence at the end that says, "If you're not interested in this product or if you've already purchased it and you don't want to receive any more emails about it, that's fine. Just click here and let me know and I won't send it to you again." And what that does is it stops people from unsubscribing from your email list because they have another way of opting out of those emails that they're just not interested in.\
\
[00:34:33.270] - Leanne\
Also, when you do write your emails and and you're promoting an affiliate product, try to make it more than just a promotion, try to make it something that somebody is going to want to read. So, tell stories, find ways to connect with your audience, be vulnerable, tell them about your struggles, give them tips, give them some educational information, tell them funny stories that you know, you can make a promotional email still really valuable.\
\
[00:35:02.280] - Leanne\
So, a few more affiliate marketing tips, so number one, is focused on the benefits. So, what I mean by benefits is the features of a product. You need to talk about how those features translate into real life in terms of how they are going to improve somebody's quality of life. Is it going to save them time? Is it going to save them money, you know talk about what life looks like with more time or more money or whatever it is that they are benefiting from. So, sort of give this sort of before and after picture, and that's quite powerful.\
\
[00:35:35.760] - Leanne\
Also, make sure that you use multiple links on your blog articles. Don't just rely on putting one link at the end of your article. Not everyone will get to the end. And you don't want to have to make people go searching for your links. It is about striking a balance. You don't want to use so many links on your blog post that it looks really spammy. So you need to strike that balance. But I like to have one at the beginning, one at the end, one in the middle, and then occasionally I'll use a few more here and there if I've got some buttons some comparison tables or something along those lines.\
\
[00:36:08.040] - Leanne\
When you first get started, I recommend focusing just on one or two products and get really good at promoting those products, create lots of different articles that reach people at different points in the funnel and just learn how to promote one and then use that same technique for promoting your other products. And if you really sort of focus in on one or two products, you will start to find results happen much faster than if you're spreading yourself too thin.\
\
[00:36:36.750] - Leanne\
If you're a more advanced blogger and you're wondering where to go now with your affiliate strategy, then definitely think about creating a email funnels, which you can automate. So, when somebody joins your email list, they get a series of emails, firstly, to warn them up and introduce them to yourself, give them lots of tips, and then gradually expose them to your affiliate products and talk to them about the benefits. You can try promoting an open close cart sale.\
\
[00:37:02.460] - Leanne\
So, I mentioned before about Ultimate Bundles. That's just one affiliate program that you can join as one of my favorites. But there are lots of programs out there like that. You could consider putting some ad spend behind your articles, but only do that if the article is converting really well. So, you need to understand how much money you make on average for every person that lands on your blog post. Without knowing that information, it's very difficult to know whether you will benefit from putting any ad spend behind it. Also, you might want to look at your strategy and make some tweaks. So, for example, you can use heat maps where you get a visual depiction of how people are interacting with your post and you can see where they're clicking and what sort of links they're clicking more on. And then you can make some tweaks to your articles. And one of the ways that you do that is by joining Affiliamate. That gives you a lot of information about which of your articles performing well and which are underperforming.\
\
[00:37:57.690] - Leanne\
So, I've created some affiliate article templates, which I am giving away for free today, and six of them, and they cover six of the most common types of affiliate programs, and they are designed to basically help you structure your articles in a way that will help both with an SEO, SEO point of view and and help your articles rank on Google. But they will also help with you making sales as well. So, they're designed to guide people through that buying decision process.\
\
[00:38:34.770] - Leanne\
So, if you want to get hold of these templates, like I said, they are free, all you need to do is go to Passiveincomesuperstars.com/templates.\
\
[00:38:46.930] - Leanne\
And if you are ready to take your affiliate marketing strategy to the next level, then I would recommend is my course Affiliate Marketing Superstars.

**Transcript:**\
[00:00:13.790] - Leanne\
Hello and welcome to this presentation about how to earn a big income with a small blog. My name is Leanne Scott. I teach passive income strategy to bloggers, and I'm here today to show you you that you do not need a million followers or a zillion page views in order to be successful. What you do need is a strategy, and that's going to be what we're going to talk about today.\
\
[00:00:40.930] - Leanne\
So, I started my career as a doctor and I was getting quite stressed. I didn't have much in the way of work life balance. And so, I took four months off, went on a sabbatical, went to South America, and I started a travel blog. And I quickly realized just how much I loved travel blogging. But in particular, I really, really got into passive income strategy and affiliate marketing. And it very quickly became something that I realized I wanted to do as a career. And so, I have now transitioned from being a doctor into a travel blogger.\
\
[00:01:18.170] - Leanne\
And then from there I started teaching blogging as well. So, I still do a lot of traveling. I'm the owner of a very badly behaved campervan called Nell. But most of the time, I can be found teaching ethical passive income strategies to bloggers, including affiliate marketing, email marketing, and selling digital products. And if you want to join my community, you can find us over at Facebook.com/groups/passiveincomebloggers.\
\
[00:01:43.960] - Leanne\
And I'd also encourage you to download my affiliate templates, which you'll find a link to below in order to be able to start getting some results with your own website. So, today, we're going to be talking about strategies for small and low authority sites to rank for lucrative keywords. We are going to be talking about the type of affiliate programs which have the power to grow your income much, much faster than say, the likes of Amazon Associates. We're going to be talking about your secret superpower that only small bloggers have.\
\
[00:02:17.800] - Leanne\
We are going to talk about how to target lucrative keywords bigger bloggers are overlooking, and how to outrank those bigger bloggers to rank number one for your keyword.\
\
[00:02:27.190] - Leanne\
And we're also going to be talking about how you can get your audience to return to your content when they are ready to buy. So, a quick reminder for anybody who's new to affiliate marketing. Affiliate marketing is basically a way of earning commissions when somebody buys a product through your unique affiliate link. So, if you recommend a product, somebody clicks on it, and then if they buy within a defined period of time, which is known as the cookie period, then you're going to get a percentage of that sale. And you can use your affiliate links in blog posts, pages on your site,\
\
[00:02:59.860] - Leanne\
email, social media, Pinterest, lots of different ways to use them. But you do need to check the rules of each program to understand what you're allowed to do and where you're allowed to promote it.\
\
[00:03:11.230] - Leanne\
So Firstly, I want to completely get rid of this myth. Okay. So, I hear all the time that people say that you need lots of traffic to earn a decent income blogging. And whilst it makes it easier, it's definitely not an essential. So, I started earning consistent income when I had around 5000 page fees. And to be honest, I probably could have started earning a little bit sooner than that, but it was around 5000 page views when I start to get really serious about SEO and affiliate marketing.\
\
[00:03:38.960] - Leanne\
And then by the time I reached 40,000 page views, I was having consistent $5,000 a month and that income was 100% from affiliate marketing and passive income strategies.\
\
[00:03:51.040] - Leanne\
There was no paid sponsorships or anything like that. It was all completely passive income. And if I can do it, then you can absolutely do it too. I didn't come from a background of social media marketing or writing or anything along those lines. I went to University and I trained to become a doctor, so a completely different career, and I managed to make a success of this. And you can see over on the right there that they're one of the commissions from just one of my affiliate programs.\
\
[00:04:21.470] - Leanne\
I am just shy of \'a325,000 and made that particular company over \'a3400,000.\
\
[00:04:33.830] - Leanne\
So, successful affiliate marketing involves solving problems with products or services. I want you to remember that this is so so important. And this is where most bloggers go wrong that they're not really thinking about their affiliate links and what the goal is. The goal is always to solve a problem or to help somebody to achieve a goal with a product or a service. So, in order to do this, you need to understand your ideal reader. So, spend some time thinking about who it is that you're reaching with your blog, try to understand what problems they might have, goals they have, frustrations.\
\
[00:05:10.380] - Leanne\
And if you're not sure you can ask them, ask them on social media what's your biggest problem? What would you love a solution to? And then once you've got a good idea of this, you can then start looking at products that you promote and thinking about products, experiences or services that can address these issues, particularly if they're going to help somebody to either get rid of a problem or achieve a goal either faster, better or cheaper.\
\
[00:05:39.810] - Leanne\
So, let's talk about finding the right product to promote. So, I would recommend if you're a smaller blogger, you're going to see results much faster if you focus on promoting slightly higher priced products. And the reason for this is because it is so much easier to sell a handful of expensive products than hundreds of low cost products. So, if you are selling, say a $1,000 product with a 10% Commission, that's $100 per sale. If you sell ten of those, then you've made your 1st $1,000.\
\
[00:06:15.520] - Leanne\
However, if you're selling a $10 product with the same 10% Commission, you're going to need to sell 100 of those to have the same income. And that's going to be much much harder. So, there are high ticket affiliate products in virtually every niche, but some niches you do have to look at a little bit harder to find them.\
\
[00:06:36.090] - Leanne\
So, we're going to be focusing on three types of programs. So, the first one is your high ticket products. These are the more expensive products and luxury one off big spends. So, have a little think about what's the most expensive thing that you've spent money on.\
\
[00:06:49.770] - Leanne\
The next one are high Commission products. These might not necessarily have the same high price tag, but you're getting a higher percentage Commission. So, there are some physical products that have high commissions, but because there is a bigger profit margin with digital products, like online courses, you can often get commissions of anywhere between, say, 30 and 70% for online courses. And there are online courses in virtually every single niche. So, again, that can be really really lucrative.\
\
[00:07:19.570] - Leanne\
And the third one I want you to think about is recurring income. So, this means that you are earning income every single month and that's going to add up. So, think about things where somebody has to subscribe. You don't always get recurring commissions with subscriptions, but often you do. So, have a little think about subscriptions within your niche.\
\
[00:07:43.390] - Leanne\
So, the first question I want you to ask yourself is what is the biggest splurge that you have made on a product and experience or a service that you would be willing to spend on again? Is there something that you would rave about to your friends? You've got no problem, no hesitation in recommending it because even though it's expensive, it's completely worth that price. And it's something that's been super valuable to you. So, have a little think about your niche and have a think about what that might be. If we've got, take a look at three popular niche here.\
\
[00:08:16.900] - Leanne\
You can see that there are high ticket products in every single one of these niches. So, for example, in travel, it could be an experience like a cruise or Safari or an expedition. It could be the camera that you use. It could be an online language course you took. It could be a luxury luggage set or quality backpack. Or it could be something like a tent\
\
[00:08:35.470] - Leanne\
if you go camping. It could be hiring a campervan or an RV. If you're in the family niche, it could be something like nursery furniture or a quality Prem or car seat. It could be a summer camp. You sent your kids on a resort that you took your family away on. It could be a home schooling course.\
\
[00:08:52.420] - Leanne\
It could be a service like, for example, hiring a nanny. It could be outdoor play equipment in the garden. And if you're in the health and fitness niche, it could be home fitness equipment, a gym membership. It could be boot camp or fitness retreat, you went on a weight loss program that you signed up to. It could be nutritional supplements that you get every month or a fitness watch that you purchased, or it could be something like a race or an endurance event that you signed up to.\
\
[00:09:20.810] - Leanne\
So, the next one is the high Commission products. So, remember, these are mostly digital products, but not always. And the way that you can find the physical products that have high commissions is by having a look on affiliate networks and filtering via EPCs. You're looking for the programs that have the highest earnings per click.\
\
[00:09:40.460] - Leanne\
So that's often a good way to find products that have high commission rates in terms of finding digital products. And remember, there are online courses in virtually every single niche. The best way to find those is by searching your niche or a topic within your niche and then the name of a popular course platform. And so, they are course platforms like Podia, Teachable, Kajabi, or Think It. So say, for example, you were in the fitness niche.\
\
[00:10:10.790] - Leanne\
You might type in fitness podio or fitness teachable and see what comes up. You might also search for specific topics like yoga Podia, yoga teachable, and that way you're going to find a lot of online courses. And if you're in the same niche, you might be able to reach out to that blogger and propose a collaboration. Because often bloggers will be willing to give away their courses for free. If they can see that you're going to be a really really good affiliate for them.\
\
[00:10:35.840] - Leanne\
But you need to pitch that just like you would pitch any sponsorship to a brand. You can also look for things like ebooks on marketplaces. There are a couple of online marketplaces for ebooks such as Ejunkies, which is marketejunkie.com. And there is also Discovergumroad.com.\
\
[00:10:53.690] - Leanne\
So, they're good places to find ebooks. If you think about things like online courses, memberships, ebooks, software, apps, planners, printables, they're all going to have those high commission rates. It's also worth asking in Facebook groups, particularly groups of other bloggers.\
\
[00:11:11.600] - Leanne\
A lot of them might have their own products and be looking for affiliates, so ask in those groups. And if you know of any bloggers that have their own online courses or ebooks that you think would be a good fit for your audience, then you can reach out to them directly.\
\
[00:11:28.170] - Leanne\
And then finally, we've got those recurring commission programs. Now what I will say about this is that there are definitely more of these in the B2B niches, the finance, gaming, online security niche. But there are still programs in all niches. If you look hard enough. So, think about things like subscription boxes, monthly magazines, online software, membership, things like that. And you see there are some examples here.\
\
[00:11:51.310] - Leanne\
So, for example, in the travel niche, we've got the Dollar Flight Club, where they find flight deals every month and email them to you. You can get a 50% recurring commission on that. There's Fan Jewel, which is fantasy sports Gaming, which is the 35% recurring commission. We've got format, which is for photographers. It's an online portfolio system with 20% to 30% recurring Commission.\
\
[00:12:16.510] - Leanne\
Safety Wing is another one for travel bloggers. It's travel insurance with 10% recurring Commission. We've got Food Blogger Pro, which is a membership teaching food bloggers how to grow their food blogs. And you can get 20% to 40% recurring commissions with that. And we've also got the Benefit Box, which is a nutritional supplement subscription where you get between 3 and $9 per box sold.\
\
[00:12:40.350] - Leanne\
So imagine if you are selling ten even at the lower end of that. So, say you are selling ten $3 products, that's $30 every month, but every month that's going to increase. So, after ten months of selling you know an extra ten every month, you've now got an income of $300 that you are getting every single month and that's only going to grow.\
\
[00:13:05.050] - Leanne\
So, you might be thinking, okay, that's great. I've got an idea. Now I want to get these high ticket products, but perhaps you haven't actually got an experience with high ticket products. And that sounds pretty expensive to go out and buy one of those products only to promote it. So, in an ideal world, you will think about things that you've already spent on. But if you don't, if there's nothing that you can think of, then here are a few ways in order to sort of save money on doing this.\
\
[00:13:33.230] - Leanne\
So, the first thing would be to ask around and see if any of your friends have the product that perhaps you could borrow for a few days. If it's, say an online thing like some software or program online, then often they'll have free trials. So, you know make the most of those free trials. Also try to purchase the product during sales periods. A really good example of this is there is a company called Ultimate Bundles that sells a bundle of digital products in virtually every niche, and they've got a different sale every few weeks.\
\
[00:14:04.850] - Leanne\
And so what you can do is when your niche's bundle is available, you can sign up to that. You can actually promote the bundle and earn money that way. But you can then sign up to all the individual products that are relevant for your audience. And like I said, they do have bundles in virtually every niche, family niches, photography, travel, food and cooking so many different niches. So that's a really good way to do it.\
\
[00:14:31.030] - Leanne\
You could hire a writer like a ghostwriter that does have experience with the product. You could arrange a collaboration with other bloggers. So, for example, if you're doing a round up of products, you could ask bloggers to talk about the product that they have experience with. So, you're gaining collectively from their experience. You could pitch the brand just like you would for sponsorship, so you could pitch a sponsorship or a trial or a giveaway.\
\
[00:14:57.640] - Leanne\
But you just need to make sure that if you're doing that, you're very clear that you do intend to promote the product as an affiliate and make sure that they allow for that. You could buy the product second hand and then sell it on secondhand if you no longer need it. So, often, products don't really lose that much value if they're already secondhand. And the other option is that you could keep back a proportion of your affiliate revenue in order to reinvest that in other products.\
\
[00:15:28.370] - Leanne\
In order to be successful with affiliate marketing, particularly when you have a smaller blog and a smaller audience, you need to really understand the sales funnel. So, the idea is that a person moves from being unaware of a problem or unaware of a goal, and then gradually you become more aware of that problem or goal. Then they become aware of the solutions, and then they become aware of specific products. So, you're going to be reaching people at different stages of this cycle with different types of article.\
\
[00:15:56.700] - Leanne\
So, when somebody is currently not aware of a problem or a goal, you might make them aware of that with an inspirational article.\
\
[00:16:03.910] - Leanne\
And then when they become aware of that issue, they're not quite sure how to solve it. So, they might go and search something like a how to guide, and then that's going to help them become aware of various solutions, but not necessarily specific products. So, at that point, you might want to reach them with something like a product roundup or a buying guide or something along those lines. And then finally, when they're product aware, they're now deciding which is the right product that's going to be a good fit for them.\
\
[00:16:29.670] - Leanne\
So, things like reviews, comparisons, interviews with product owners, case studies, things like that are going to be what makes them make that decision, which product to go for.\
\
[00:16:40.250] - Leanne\
So, when somebody is at the top of the funnel, they are less likely to make a purchase. So, these sort of inspirational articles are not going to convert very many affiliate links. So, if you've got lots of these articles that are getting lots of traffic on your blog, you might be able to earn some ad revenue with them. But you're not going to earn very much with affiliate marketing. So, therefore, it's really important that you make sure on your blog you have more of these articles that are reaching people at the bottom of the funnel.\
\
[00:17:08.130] - Leanne\
So, particularly reviews, comparisons, interviews and case studies, and then also product roundups and buying guides. And you'll want to have some how to guides there as well. Ideally, you will have articles that reach people at every stage of that funnel on your website, and you don't have to make every single article that you write, a review or a comparison that's going to get boring pretty quickly. But just make a commitment. Perhaps once every one in every three blog posts or something like that is something that is going to be focused on your affiliate links.\
\
[00:17:37.770] - Leanne\
And that's the way that you're going to start earning decent money even with a small blog.\
\
[00:17:44.250] - Leanne\
So, you do not need a lot of traffic. But you do need the right traffic. So if you were to get 100 people who were already ready to buy that product to read your article. It's going to be so much more effective than, say, getting 1000 people to read an article when they're just not ready to buy. They haven't even realized they've got an issue. They haven't realized they've got a problem.\
\
[00:18:09.050] - Leanne\
They don't have a goal in mind. It's too early in that funnel for them to buy. So, even though there's more people reading it, you're going to earn less money. And often bloggers get bogged down by search volume. But it's far less important than purchase intent.\
\
[00:18:25.500] - Leanne\
So, many bloggers will shoot for those high volume keywords, but they're not going to think about monetization until later, and that's never going to be as effective. And many of these big bloggers are going to skip past those keywords below a certain search volume. But that actually represents an opportunity for smaller savvy bloggers like you to go and moz up those smaller keywords, but the ones that have high purchase intent.\
\
[00:18:55.570] - Leanne\
So, let me show you an example. Say, you were a travel blogger and you wrote an article called Best Cities in Europe on a Budget. Now this particular phrase shows very low like purchase intent. Somebody is very unlikely to purchase a product through this article because they're just in the idea stage. However, if they start to search something like Best Places to Stay in Lisbon on a budget, they've now moved into the planning stage, and now you've got a better chance of getting an affiliate sale.\
\
[00:19:31.750] - Leanne\
However, you could take it to the next level, and a super high purchase intent would be somebody that's looking at a review. So, a particular hotel review that's going to have a very high chance of making an affiliate sale. So, you can create these sort of purchase intent keyword formulas where you would keep this in mind every time you join a new affiliate program and create clusters of content targeting different keywords. So, we want to be looking at reviews, comparisons, best products within a certain niche, or for a certain person.\
\
[00:20:08.910] - Leanne\
The how to guide where the product is part of that solution.\
\
[00:20:12.510] - Leanne\
Tutorials, demos, case studies, how to use a product, best Places to Stay in a certain place, is a certain product worth it, that's a little bit like a review post. These are all the sorts of keywords that you need to be targeting if you want to earn a good income with your blog.\
\
[00:20:33.250] - Leanne\
So, once you've written one of these articles, you shouldn't stop there. You need to write more articles around the same topic. Now they need to be slightly different. You don't want to write the same article in several different ways because you're just basically competing with yourself. But you need to look at it from different angles. So, for example, if you've written a review article, then perhaps you could write a comparison, or perhaps you could do a top ten listicle, or perhaps more of a solution focused article or tutorial.\
\
[00:20:59.540] - Leanne\
I'll just mention the product and other blog posts and linking back to those review posts and interlinking all of your blog posts together. And the more related content that you have around a topic, the more that Google is going to start to see you as the expert. It also helps to keep someone coming back to your site until they are ready to make purchase. If you can add a related lead magnet to these pages to get that person onto your email list or to at least follow you on social media so that you have a way to reconnect with them.\
\
[00:21:33.790] - Leanne\
I just want to share with you a little case study. This is a blog post that gets tiny search volumes.\
\
[00:21:41.430] - Leanne\
Okay. It only gets 75 page views a month. So, it was a review of a hiking trip in Peru. The keywords I targeted had a tiny search volume of just ten, and I am ranking for several other similar search terms, but they've all got tiny, tiny keyword search volumes. And so, like I said, I only get 75 unique visits per month, which is tiny. Now that particular article has generated $2,361 over 20 months.\
\
[00:22:11.310] - Leanne\
So that means that for every 1000 people that visit that page, it's making $1,300. And if you compare that to ads you might be earning, say $20 or if you're lucky, $30 or $40 per thousand page views. So, you can see that's a massive massive difference. And that's why you can earn a really good income with a small blog if you're managing to target these high purchase intent keywords. So, why was the Rpm so high for that particular blog post?\
\
[00:22:42.320] - Leanne\
Well, Firstly, it targeted a keyword with a super high purchase intent. So, it was a review article to remember that's meeting people at the end of the funnel. It was also a high ticket product, so I didn't have to sell too many of them in order to start seeing the decent commissions. And the article was very thorough, so it left no questions unanswered. I always include an FAQ section at the end of all of these articles, which means that people are less likely to feel that they need to go away and do more research.\
\
[00:23:08.980] - Leanne\
I've already answered all their questions. I've also used clear call to actions throughout. So, I like using things like buttons, bright colored text, make my affiliate links nice and bold. I tell people what to do. I say click here in order to check the up to date prices. I give them some guidance, and so that has resulted in a 16% click through rate, and the industry average is actually only 1 o 2%.\
\
[00:23:32.910] - Leanne\
So, if you can get a 16% click through rate, you're already in a really strong position. And the other thing that I did was I had a variety of routes back to the site. So, let me give you a scenario if somebody has already decided that they want to go on a particular trip, but they just need that little bit of confidence. So, they go and look up some reviews. Now, they've already saved that article to their bookmarks.\
\
[00:23:57.210] - Leanne\
They know where to go to it in order to get back to that. They don't need to click through your affiliate link, but your article might be what persuades them. So, you need to have other routes back to that website, other affiliate links that direct them to pages that they might not have seen. So, in this particular case, it was a cancellation policy. However, it could be anything.\
\
[00:24:16.530] - Leanne\
It could be a link to a testimonial page. It could be a link to a charity that that company supports. It could be a link to a discount page or something along those lines. So, have a little think about pages that they might not have seen that you can use to lock that affiliate cookie.\
\
[00:24:35.990] - Leanne\
So what happens if somebody visits your blog post, but they're not ready to buy? Now, there are three scenarios here. So, one is that they visit your blog post and your blog post is what persuades them to buy and they purchase straight away and you get the commission. The second is that they are not quite ready to buy straight away, but a few days later they decide to go ahead.\
\
[00:24:56.640] - Leanne\
And because you're within the cookie period, you get the Commission. The third scenario is that they're not ready after reading your article in order to purchase, and they need more time. But unfortunately, they take longer to make that decision than your cookie period is valid for. And so, in this circumstance, you're going to lose the commission unless you can find a way in order to get them to click on your affiliate link again when they're ready to buy the product. So, one of the best ways to do this is to offer a related lead magnet, something that the person who would buy that affiliate product would also be interested in.\
\
[00:25:32.550] - Leanne\
So it could be like a checklist or something along those lines, like a PDF guide, something that helps that particular type of person and that they're going to be interested to download for free. And then they get onto your email list. And then this is going to give you the opportunity to send a sequence of emails. It's going to grow that trust. So, they're going to trust you, but also to help them with that purchase decision.\
\
[00:25:56.570] - Leanne\
And if you don't have an email list yet, then firstly, I would encourage you to start email lists are super lucrative, really useful to have. And these days, with social media algorithms changing all the time, email marketing is becoming more and more important. But if you don't have an email list, then at the very least, try to get somebody to follow you on social media. Because again, you've got an opportunity to get your affiliate links in front of them again. So, make sure that you've got things like little pop ups that say follow me on social media, or perhaps an incentive to join your Facebook group or to go over to Instagram.\
\
[00:26:30.300] - Leanne\
Tell them about you know the content that you create over there.\
\
[00:26:36.630] - Leanne\
So, if you go down the route of creating an affiliate email funnel, then what you want to do is firstly, offer a closely related freebie. And this is really important because you want to get the ideal people on your email list. There's no point growing your email list of people who are not interested in the products that you're going to be promoting. They're not interested in the topics that you write about. So, you need to make sure that whatever it is that you're promoting as a freebie is highly relevant.\
\
[00:27:01.470] - Leanne\
And then you would send a welcome email.\
\
[00:27:03.490] - Leanne\
You deliver that freebie in your welcome email and you introduce them to your brand and give them a little bit of background about yourself. Then you might send a couple of emails to warm them up on related topics with quick win tips. Okay, so this is going to keep them opening your emails. It's going to help them trust you. And then you're going to start looping back to that affiliate product in like, a little mini sale series.\
\
[00:27:22.990] - Leanne\
Treat it like it's your own product, so you could focus on the results that you got. You could give, like a mini case study. You could answer some frequently asked questions. So, just think about the different ways that you could promote that and keep looping back to that affiliate product. And then once they've gone through that little series of affiliate promo emails, you can then tag them as ready for your newsletter.\
\
[00:27:45.050] - Leanne\
And now you have grown your email list with people that are your ideal reader. So, finally, I wanted to talk about your small blog superpower. So when you have a smaller following or an email list, you've got the opportunity to be super helpful because you're not going to have as many people commenting on your posts or replying to your emails. So, you can give more attention to the ones that do. So, you can answer their questions personally provide a lot of value.\
\
[00:28:13.380] - Leanne\
I personally like to use a tool called Vocalbird, which is a Chrome extension which allows me to record voice messages. You can also use things like loom to do videos, and this means that you can send that video or that voicemail message to somebody. And it's a really personal way to get in touch with somebody. It's also a good time saver because it's much faster to record a voice message than it is to type a message. But it allows you to really give that personal experience. And this is going to help you to basically build that loyalty with your followers.\
\
[00:28:47.870] - Leanne\
And there is this theory of reciprocity. I can never say that word reciprocity where basically, if you are providing a lot of value for somebody, they want to do a favor back for you. So, if they're going to purchase the product, they might actually come and seek your affiliate links. They might ask you what your affiliate link is, and they're far more likely to follow your recommendations and suggestions if they trust you because they've had this experience with you. So, get to know your loyal followers.\
\
[00:29:14.910] - Leanne\
Respond to them. Remember the small details about them. You know if there's something that comes up a topic that comes up in a Facebook group or something, you could tag them because you know that they'd be interested in it. You can you know remind them of small details from your conversations. And you can also send direct messages to those who are actively engaging with your content. Now, what I don't mean is that really annoying, like cold pitching in some of these DMs super annoying when you don't know somebody, and the next thing you know, they're recommending their product to you in the DMs.\
\
[00:29:46.670] - Leanne\
Don't do that, but you can use Instagram stories to give your audience an opportunity to engage, and you can use that as an opportunity to discover that the problems that they might be facing or the goals that they have. And then you can think about ways that you could solve those problems or help them achieve their goals with products. So, for example, you could ask them which they struggle with most A or B, and then if they click on A or B, you can then follow up with them because they've already shown that they're engaged.\
\
[00:30:15.660] - Leanne\
They've already told you that they've got a problem and you can follow up with a helpful message, make sure that you do provide value in your message, like give them a tip or something like that. And then you can follow up and say you might also be interested in this particular product that I recommend, and you can then share your affiliate link, and you are reaching people who are quite likely to convert. Because they've already told you that they have that problem and need a solution.\
\
[00:30:40.770] - Leanne\
So, hopefully, you found this presentation helpful. And what I wanted to do was to also share these affiliate article templates with you. So, these are templates that will help you to write those types of articles that we've talked about that are really lucrative, but to write them in a way that actually converts sales. So, all you need to do is go to passiveincomesupstars.com/templates, and you can download those completely for free. And if you're ready to take things to the next level.\
\
[00:31:11.440] - Leanne\
Then I do also have an affiliate marketing course. It's called Affiliate Marketing Superstars, and it's a really deep dive into affiliate marketing strategy. We start with the basics and work right up to more advanced modules. So, there are twelve different modules. We cover everything from affiliate psychology and social media strategy.\
\
[00:31:29.430] - Leanne\

And you can get 15% off with the coupon Code BB Summit until February, the 11th. So, I hope that some of you will join me in the course. I hope that you'll go and download your free affiliate article templates. Remember that's Passiveincomesupstars.com/templates. And I hope that you have learnt something about affiliate marketing and that you won't let you know not having huge amounts of blog traffic stop you from earning a good income with your blog because it's absolutely possible.\
\
[00:32:20.550] - Leanne\
Let me know if you have any questions.\

She's a mom of three teenagers and the founder of FluencerFruit. Big warm welcome to Liz Saunders. Liz, thank you so much for joining us.\
\
[00:00:34.180] - Liz Saunders\
Thank you, Liz. I'm so excited to be here and to join you. I was thinking about this earlier. I love how virtual events, and you've been doing this for five years now, so you were even pre the whole move with COVID and everything?\
\
[00:00:47.240] - Liz, Host\
The first one was February 2020.\
\

That's so impressive. You were like, "No I got this," whatever. But I love how whether you're adding to your in-person events that you go and do, like we do FinCon, or if you are just not able to travel right now, this is such a great way to get all of this amazing content from so many different people without even leaving your house. So yeah, thank you for having me and thank you for coordinating this. Amazing. Well, I'll share my screen, and we'll get started. But today, we're going to talk a little bit about how to make money reviewing products on Amazon. And even though, Liz did my introduction, I do want to just tell you a little bit about who I am and how I got here. So, I am the mom to three teenagers. And I did start many years ago as an Amazon Associate. So if you are new to the Amazon ecosystem, the Amazon Associate Program is what they have named their affiliate program. And I tried years ago to create content, develop a blog, do whatever, and just never really found much traction for myself with the Associate Program.\
\
[00:02:02.100] - Liz\
I was friends with lots of people doing great things, I just couldn't seem to make it happen. I've messed around with Amazon KDP, which is Kindle Direct Publishing and their digital book stuff. And I have messed around with Amazon Merch as well, which is their print-on-demand product program. So safe to say, I started as a seller in 2016 and then worked for one of the seller software's, Jungle Scout, for six years. And I'm pretty just obsessed with all of the different ways you can make money on Amazon. And so that led me to Amazon Influencer, which launched in 2020 in beta, and then 2021 for on-site coming out of beta. Now, I want to say really quickly, it launched actually in 2017. So a lot of you content creators who are OG bloggers are like, "Hang on, I think I'm an influencer. Don't I know this? I have a storefront somewhere, right?" And the answer is, yes, you do. But then they needed some place to put this on-site shoppable content. And I think Amazon looked around at the ecosystem, and they were like, "We have this group of content creators over here. Let's try this with them."\
\
[00:03:18.370] - Liz\
So they did it in beta in 2020, and then they went live in 2021, which is when I joined the Amazon Influencer Program. And so I want to tell you a little bit about Influencer, how it's different from Associate. And the thing that I like to do as we get started is, when I say the word influencer, the first thing that comes to your mind is somebody who has TikTok, Instagram, Blog, and they are creating content on one of those other platforms and driving traffic to Amazon. So, for the purposes of our conversation today, I want you to take that definition and put it on a shelf, right?\
\
[00:03:54.490] - Liz\
Because Amazon has named this program Amazon Influencer, which creates a little bit of confusion because it's not that. The Amazon Influencer Program is indeed an offshoot of the Associates Program. Hence those of you OG bloggers who have had a storefront for years and years are like, "Wait a minute. It is an offshoot of that program." But when they added on-site content, it really started to change what the program is. So how is it different? Amazon Influencer allows content creators to upload content that lives on Amazon specifically, and we'll talk about some of those placements.\
\
[00:04:33.720] - Liz\
The content is uploaded, and you do get to put it on your storefront, but it also appears in other places on the Amazon, just all over the place, right? The beauty of this, so for people like me who \'97I've always wanted to do this, right? I've wanted to create affiliate content, drive content, drive traffic, but just never found a way to build that audience offsite. This is a way to make money in the Amazon ecosystem where you're not driving traffic. This content lives there, and that's how you make money is off of people already shopping.\
\
[00:05:11.800] - Liz\
And the way that you get paid through this program is you're going to create content, so those shoppable videos, those video reviews, any product you have in your house that has a listing on Amazon, you don't even have to have bought it on Amazon, right? Anything you've got, if it's got a listing, you can create content for it. And if somebody watches your content on Amazon, engages with it, makes a purchase, you make 1 to 4%, right?\
\
[00:05:39.170] - Liz\
So, how is that different than the affiliate program? So, here are some of my posts, some of my favorite ones that I've done. And the difference is, with Associate, of course, you're driving traffic with Influencer, you're on-site. But the other difference monetarily for us is if you are driving traffic, you've got that 24-hour cart cookie, right? So everything in your cart. And then for affiliate, you get only the one item. So for example, my little shade tent over here, which I adore and has made me a lot of money, 12 months and about $5,000 worth of commission just from shoppable content that I wasn't driving traffic to. But when people click on this, they make a purchase. I make commission off of that one item or a related purchase, but only the one item. So I call the related purchase is one-click arm's length distance. So if you click from my little shade tent to a different item that Amazon is recommending, I get commission off of that one-click distance there as well.\
\
[00:06:41.900] - Liz\
But let's talk about \'97we're going to start at the beginning, qualification. We're going to go through how you make money, where the content lives, and then how to pick products. So we're just going to walk through a 101 today of how to make money doing this.\
\
[00:06:57.980] - Liz\
So first, let's start with how do you qualify for the Influencer Program? Now, this group is going to be a lot of content creators, so you guys are probably all going to be in really good shape to add this as a stream of revenue pretty quickly. Now, the way you qualify is you have to have an engaged audience on one of these platforms.\
\
[00:07:19.960] - Liz\
There's four platforms that they work with. And unfortunately, they don't tell us a ton about the qualifications, but we'll talk about that. The other thing that they're not currently doing is, so if you are an associate and you're driving traffic, while we think that that does good things for you, it's not currently part of the requirement to get approved.\
\
[00:07:43.140] - Liz\
So, here are the four platforms that you can use to get into the Amazon Influencer Program. The first two are YouTube and TikTok. These happen to be the hardest and the easiest platforms respectively to get approved with. Youtube happens to currently be the hardest platform to get approved with. TikTok is the easiest platform to get approved with. Now, my theory on why TikTok is the easiest to get approved with is because the TikTok algorithm is designed for engagement, which is really what Amazon is looking for.\
\
[00:08:15.150] - Liz\
So, if you are starting from ground zero today and you're like, "Which platform should I pick?" Go to TikTok, create content multiple times a day, post for three, four weeks, and then try to get in. Because we are seeing people that make that happen successfully, consistently right now.\
\
[00:08:34.870] - Liz\
Now, the next two platforms that you can get in with are Facebook and Instagram. And I pull these out separately just because there is a little bit of a difference with these. So these are, of course, both owned by Meta. And in order to get into the influencer program with either of these, it has to be a business account. So, it can't be your personal profile with 5,000 friends. It can't be your personal, locked Instagram. It has to be a business account.\
\
[00:09:05.120] - Liz\
So, both of these can be changed into business accounts if they're currently personal, right? But in the Facebook side of things, it can be a creator profile, a page, a group. And if you have \'97so just thinking through some of our OG bloggers, if you used to run challenges and build Facebook groups for challenges, and they're public, it has to be public so that Amazon can see where you're posting stuff. Those are good options for things that maybe are sitting around in your archive that you haven't utilized in a while. Go redevelop that engagement. Get that fired back up and go with that.\
\
[00:09:45.820] - Liz\
Now, on the Instagram side, you can make your personal Instagram profile a business account pretty quickly. If you haven't done this, it's a really quick Google search, and it's like a quick switch of your account type in the backend. So if you have a really solid following, but you've just never switched your account, go do that and then go apply. It just is very easy.\
\
[00:10:08.280] - Liz\
Now, the thing that I want to tell you specifically about these two platforms, if you decide to apply with an Instagram account that was personal that you changed over to be a public business account, once you get accepted, you cannot change that back to a private personal account. Amazon will at some point sweep through and close your account because of it. Whatever you get approved with has to stay the same way that it was. So just be sure that once you make all of your personal Instagram stuff public and also a business account, it's something you're willing to commit to and there's not content in there that you only wanted to share for a period of time.\
\
[00:10:53.040] - Liz\
And then TikTok. So quite honestly, again, ground zero, go start a TikTok channel, talk about anything. Just pick your poison. Whatever you can talk about every day, three times a day, go do that. And the content on Amazon does not have to be niched to what you talk about on your platform that you get approved with. So, for example, and I'm going to switch here and talk a little bit about follower needs here as well. So I got approved with an Instagram account that is a food and health fitness journal, right? Basically, for 90% of it, it's pictures of the food I'm eating that day. I did Whole30 a couple of years ago, got some traction, 2,700 followers, and that's what I got approved with for Amazon Influencer. But when I create content for on-site, I'm not talking about just health and wellness or food items, right? I review my shoes. I review dog stuff, anything that has \'97because you're not having to niche down, it can be general content for anything on Amazon.\
\
[00:12:03.420] - Liz\
Now, to talk a little bit about how many followers you need, because this is of course what everybody wants to know, and the unfortunate truth is Amazon doesn't tell us. I know you're all shocked that that's not something that they publish. But they basically tell us that you need an engaged audience. And then they say that there is a combination of your follower count and your engagement metrics, and that's really all we know. Now, you will hear people say, "You need 500. You need 1,000." We don't know. We've seen people get approved with TikToks as low as 500 followers, but their engagement is really good. And we've seen people with Facebook groups that have 100, 000 members not get approved. So there just is not a tried and true way to win this system. My best advice is to just go apply, right? If you're like, "Hey, I have this group. Do you think it'll work?" My answer is just go try, because the answer is you'll know when Amazon tells you.\
\
[00:13:05.530] - Liz\
Now, there's two parts to the application process, and I'm going to split them out. So right now, we're talking about just getting into the program. You can apply to get into the program as many times as you want. There is not a max out where they say, "You're done with this," which is why I say if you have a group, a platform somewhere, just go try and see if you can get into the program.\
\
[00:13:30.820] - Liz\
So there is on-site placement, which I'll talk about in a minute. That's a little bit different because you only get three chances at that. But before we get there, let's talk about where Amazon Influencers are making money, right? So, we make money through on-site placements, and this is going to be your next steps once you get into the program, but this is where the money is. And there's a couple places that have this on-site placement. I have on a slide here in a minute like examples of what each of the placements look like. But the ways that you make money through the program are people watching your video. The different types of content you can do: shoppable videos, shoppable photos, shoppable live streams. Now, any of those pieces of content people can engage with on-site and then make a purchase, and that's how you make commission.\
\
[00:14:24.630] - Liz\
Now, the offsite portion of this is you can be repurposing this content. If you have a blog, or an Instagram, or something else and it falls into your niche, you can also be combining this content to double up so that you can be driving that affiliate traffic in addition to taking advantage of that on-site as well.\
\
[00:14:43.870] - Liz\
And the third way that we make money is by working with brands for flat fees or additional commissions, depending on where you're finding those brands. Those are the three ways.\
\
[00:14:57.570] - Liz\
All right. So you're getting started. What equipment do you need? I like to talk about this because sometimes if people have been doing written content only or just doing photo content and they haven't moved over to video yet, sometimes you just have that hang up of something little in your mind that feels really big, right? And equipment tends to be one of those things. So the good news is you probably don't need anything new, right? You need a camera, and it can be either your computer, so, I'm currently looking at my Mac, right? This is what I use to create all of my on-site content, is either my Mac or my phone. And if you have one of those things, and I say Mac, but it could be a Dell, whatever you have with a camera, you have what you need in way of a camera, right? There are people in the Amazon Influencer Program who do really well with very high-produced content. But then there are people in the program that do really well just using their iPhone, walking around, talking about products. There it is, my little thumbs-up filter. So, whatever you have is going to work for the program, because people are looking for that authentic, trustworthy content.\
\
[00:16:14.010] - Liz\
The next thing I recommend is a tripod. If you don't already have one, it does make talking, especially if you're a hand talker like I am, much easier than walking around with your phone. The other thing that I did as I got started or when I can't find my tripod is prop my phone up. So this is not something you have to have, something I recommend.\
\
[00:16:32.440] - Liz\
But this is probably my number one recommendation. If you are going to invest in any new equipment, audio is I would say, arguably more important than your video. If you're standing outside filming something and then you go in and do a voiceover that has good video so that you don't hear people in the background, people will stay if they can hear you. Even if the video is like a B-, right? They're not going to stay if your video is an A+ and they cannot hear what you're saying or there's background noise. So if you are like, "Listen, I don't have a good mic." The one thing I recommend, go buy a mic. The ones on the left here, these Lapel mics, are really good. You can find them on Amazon for $20. Just search for Lapel mics for your iPhone or for your Android, whichever. And this little Blue desk microphone, I don't know how much this one is, $20 to $40. You can find them where they give you this good audio for a very low investment amount.\
\
[00:17:36.550] - Liz\
All right. So now you got into the program. You've been accepted. Now what? And this is in the Facebook groups or the Reddit threads, these are the number one questions that we get as people get started. It's just like any ecosystem. When you get started, there's new lingo. There's new fill-in the-blank, right? Everything you have to learn, like all the new processes, and terms of service with Amazon and everything else.\
\
[00:18:02.020] - Liz\
So, the first thing you're going to do is create three videos. And the reason you do this, is this is the approval process to get that on-site placement. So, up to this point is where if you've had a storefront forever, you are basically here, right? You are starting here. Because you have that storefront, you can create content, usually idea lists and photos that live on that storefront. But this is going to be where you start the process for on-site placement. Now, Amazon gives you this little counter, three of three videos. And once you've uploaded three, you can see I uploaded four because I didn't know when I got started. And then they give you this little lock, as well as the earned on-site commission lock, and they tell you that you are under review. Now, the reason that I don't recommend you upload 10, 20, 30, and just like, "Let's go, I'm ready," is this is the time that Amazon is going to be the most critical of your content. They are going through it with a fine-tooth comb to make sure that everything is terms of service compliant. But what you don't want to do is give them 10, 20, 30 videos to go through, because they don't tell you it's this video that didn't get you approved. They just tell you, "No." So if you have 30 videos, you have no idea if any of them passed or one of them didn't pass, right? So if you have three, it's not a big deal to go pick three more products to create a new video for, right? It's much different.\
\
[00:19:31.200] - Liz\
So, this process can take anywhere from, over the summer last year it was three to five days. Last spring, it was six to eight weeks to get approved for on-site placement. So as soon as you get approved and you're in this program, please go do the three videos because there's no telling how long it will take. And that's how you start making money with this program. So you'll see here, and this is when I published mine and when they are either in review or published.\
\
[00:20:01.870] - Liz\
But I want to talk for a minute about published versus placement because this creates a lot of confusion as people get started. So currently, you can see that my account is under review in this screenshot, but I have three published videos already. So when your videos are published, they are placed on your storefront, right? So this is published. But until you get that approval for on-site placement, they're not actually showing up anywhere else on Amazon, right?\
\
[00:20:34.000] - Liz\
Now, if you are an Associate in driving traffic, that means you can drive traffic to your storefront if you want. Those idea lists like Black Friday sales or whatever the case is, you can still be using your storefront, but Amazon isn't going to then place you on the listing or anywhere else.\
\
[00:20:53.800] - Liz\
Let's talk a little bit about a couple of the places that you can have your content show up. Placement, as a disclaimer, is 100% up to Amazon. So, when I create content, this is just a general timeline, I will upload that video and within 24 hours Amazon publishes it to my storefront. It usually takes 24 to 72 hours then for it to get on-site placement and start showing up on product listings or other locations.\
\
[00:21:25.660] - Liz\
I wanted to show you the top three locations that we look at as being the most profitable. And then just know, I'll give you a couple other descriptions of other places, but Amazon is constantly testing where to put influencer content. And so a lot of times people will be like, "I'm making a ton of money off of this one video. It's not on a product listing, and I don't know where it's making money." Just know that you won the Amazon Lotto, and they are testing it somewhere in the ecosystem that we don't have visibility into because they don't tell us.\
\
[00:21:59.190] - Liz\
So the number one placement for Amazon Influencer content is this upper carousel on the product listing. And here in a minute, I'll walk through the anatomy of the product listing, but just know for right now, this is the upper carousel on the product listing page on desktop. My videos that are in these carousels do eight to 10 times better than my videos that are not. So it is the number one thing, that number one placement. If you can land a spot in the top carousel, you're doing good. Now, as you scroll down, the upper carousel is only really on desktop. There are occasions that it shows up on mobile, but for the purposes of today, this is a desktop-only type of placement.\
\
[00:22:44.800] - Liz\
Videos for this product, this is going to be down below product information, both on mobile, usually, and on desktop. So this is going to be your most consistent placement. And you still do well with these. It's just not quite as well as this upper carousel.\
\
[00:23:03.520] - Liz\
And then the third placement that we see results from is what's called the Inspire feed. So if you haven't seen this yet, if you go to your Amazon shopping app on your phone, you see this little star guy down here on this phone app, that's the Inspire feed. And it's basically a shoppable stream, right? And there's a lot of photos. They ask for vertical shorts. If you think about this as Amazon's way trying to compete with Instagram and TikTok shop, they want fast, clever content, top 10 things that Amazon, I found for my car, whatever the case is, right? That's the type of content we see here.\
\
[00:23:47.070] - Liz\
There is one other stream that we see, which is the Discover feed. It's a little bit more in-depth to find, and I'm happy to walk anybody through it. But it's specifically for fashion and beauty products. So, Inspire tends to be dog products, all the things. Discover is specifically fashion and beauty, so that's just another place.\
\
[00:24:09.080] - Liz\
We also show up in search results. We show up sometimes if a brand doesn't have a video as the main video. Honestly, we just see Amazon put us in all sorts of places that are wild. And anytime Amazon places you somewhere, it's a really good opportunity for you to take advantage of onsite traffic for commission. It's really a lot of fun to follow along day to day.\
\
[00:24:34.310] - Liz\
Let's take a minute and just take a step back and talk about what Amazon's stated purpose is for the Amazon Influencer Program. And this is something that I like for people to keep in mind. Because people get lost in the nuance of like, "What should I talk about? Why is this here?"\
\
[00:24:53.180] - Liz\
Amazon stated purpose for the program is to help shoppers make more confident buying decisions. And so they are always looking for content that fulfills that, but also that helps them make more sales. If we are on a product listing page, it's because we're helping convert that traffic. Otherwise, we would not have been there for two years. So we are helping Amazon make more money. We're making more money. We're helping the seller make more money, and we're helping buyers make more confident buying decisions. It's like the ultimate win, as far as I'm concerned, in the Amazon ecosystem.\
\
[00:25:30.660] - Liz\
So, what kind of content can you make for shoppable photos, videos, live streams? You can do video reviews. And this is probably predominantly what people think of when they think about Amazon Influencer content is video reviews for products. Again, this is anything you've got in your house that has an Amazon listing already.\
\
[00:25:55.320] - Liz\
But what are some other types of content you can create? Because Amazon tells you that you can create, and they want you to create multiple pieces of content for the same product. So if you have a yoga mat, or I'm going to use a bookshelf for this scenario just because it makes more sense, unboxing yoga mats is not always super exciting, right? It's like, "Here's the mat." But what other kinds of content can you create? If you've got a bookshelf, like unboxing it and show how it comes and how big the box is and how many pieces are in it, doing a video of you putting it together and talking about how long it took. How good were the instructions? Did you have to watch the video on YouTube? Did you need help from the manufacturer? Those are the types of things that are really valuable to shoppers when they're considering a purchase.\
\
[00:26:43.720] - Liz\
Answering questions about the product. You can do this by looking at the Q&A down at the bottom of the product listing or thinking about what you were wondering when you were about to buy that. I have an under-the-desk treadmill, and people always want to know, "Oh, how fast can you walk on it at your desk? Do you have to have a special desk to do it?" All those sorts of things. If you can answer that for people, that's going to be valuable to them.\
\
[00:27:12.480] - Liz\
I'll tell you, my best-performing videos are three to five minutes long, so not short. Ana d they are usually for products that are in that $100 to $200 product range where people are giving it that extra thought, like they want to pick the best option for their space, for their house. My top two videos are my under-the-desk treadmill and my 10x10 shade pen for my backyard because I show people how I put it up and down by myself when I'm five foot four and not a six-foot tall person. I have to do it a little bit differently. But I've created this basically like tutorial so people can do it. I do really well on that video because it helps people make that buying decision.\
\
[00:27:58.310] - Liz\
Best use for the product, personal or practical examples. The best advice I've heard people give is think about if you and I are just sitting down and you're just telling me about this product. "Oh, my gosh, this new set of knives. I love this block. Look at how cute these handles are." Any of those things is really valuable to people.\
\
[00:28:22.120] - Liz\
All right. So you're in, you're getting on-site, you've worked through everything in your house, and you're starting to buy new things. And you think, I want to make sure that I am using my time wisely and that every time I buy something that's coming into my house that I am set up to make the most money that I can from this product.\
\
[00:28:44.590] - Liz\
So, I want to show you three things on a product listing that you want to be looking for to maximize your income when you're doing on-site content creations. So this is basically like pick your product listing, right? I have Big B, Little B, Marker Parker here. The very first thing you're going to look for is this upper carousel. So you see how it says six videos? It's got this. It says, "Click to see more videos." That's the number one thing that you want to be on the lookout for. And then that's because not everyone does, so you want to stay away from these. And then you want to look for how many videos there are, so fewer videos is better. And then you want to look at a 4.4 or higher because mathematically those listings do better. It's better for you as an influencer. Those are the three things you're going to look at when you are doing product research.\
\
[00:29:45.660] - Liz\
I think that gets us all the way through. I think the only thing I have left here is if you are ready to get started or you just have more questions about the Influencer Program, I put together a landing page for us. It's just FluencerFruitConnect.com/Breakthrough. Head over there. And I do have coaching. I have a course. The course is intended to take you if you are just getting started through monetization. It helps you so you don't have to go read all the terms of service. It's like I hold your hand and we walk through that process so that you have that help. And then I also have, if you are already an Amazon Influencer, an extension that helps with product research as well as video placement management. And as part of the "Breakthrough Summit Bundle", I do have a coupon, which will be on that page as well that gives you a free three months to the extension. So, Liz, thank you for having me. And if you guys have any questions, feel free to reach out.\
\
[00:30:52.740] - Liz, Host\
Yes, thank you. I learned so much. I'm like, "This is a whole new world now." So, yeah, if you haven't gotten the "Speaker Bonus Bundle" definitely do that because you will get three months. And everyone else, definitely go check this out. And hopefully you're as excited to learn more about this as I am. Thank you, Liz.\
\
[00:31:09.880] - Liz\
You're welcome. Thanks for having me.\

One of the things I get asked about all the time as a Web designer, especially now in this online world we've been living in, is how to set up online membership programs, things like online courses, resource libraries or video archives members only forums and other types of interactive online membership groups.\
\
[00:00:35.890] - Melissa\
As a business owner, there are so many benefits to having a membership program in your business, which I will share all about. And I am so excited to talk to you today about that and how to create an online membership program for your business.\
\
[00:00:49.430] - Melissa\
In this quick training, we're going to chat through why membership programs are so beneficial for your business and why it's so important that you set them up right. The different types of membership programs you could create and the different membership building platforms available to do that. I'll also chat through the specific method I use to create profitable membership programs for my web design clients and for my own business. And I'll leave you with a few resources if you'd like to get started outlining and building your own membership program to.\
\
[00:01:17.870] - Melissa\
Okay, so let's get into membership programs and why it's so beneficial to incorporate them in your business. First, membership programs are much more flexible service type. They allow you to offer a product or service to anyone, anywhere in the world at any time of day or night, regardless if you happen to be available to provide them the service or not.\
\
[00:01:36.830] - Melissa\
Before becoming a Web designer. I was a certified health coach. And one thing about health coaching that I'll be very familiar for anyone who also provides one on one services is that you have a finite amount of time in your day to provide those services. When you run out of time, you run out of the ability to serve your clients. So, online membership programs offer a way to serve people beyond the confines of your schedule or the number of hours you have in a day, or the number of clients you can fit into your space or whatnot. And they also allow customers more flexibility in accessing your services on a schedule and timeline that works for them; which could make you more accessible to more people.\
\
[00:02:13.880] - Melissa\
So, online membership programs are also an opportunity to grow your income. Of course, of your business is limited to the number of clients you can physically fit into your schedule. Your income is also limited by the max number of clients you can take on at one time. But online membership programs allow you to scale your services in a way that you can continue to offer your knowledge and expertise to more clients and even new audiences of clients like people who don't live anywhere near you, which means much higher income potential than a one on one service model.\
\
[00:02:46.260] - Melissa\
And passive income is one of the current buzzwords that gets many people interested in starting a membership program. As you likely know, passive income is any type of income you earn while not spending a lot of time or energy working for it. But it's not about being lazy, it's about being efficient. Many online membership programs are a form of passive income. You develop a product or service offering once and you sell it many times. The key thing to note here is that passive income doesn't just happen. It needs to be developed. But the upfront development allows you to sell your product repeatedly from wherever you are at any time of day or night. And if you set it up right, it just runs on autopilot in the background while you get to go do other things.\
\
[00:03:30.300] - Melissa\
So, there are a lot of benefits that passive income like this can bring to both your business and your personal life and allows you to reach and serve more people, which means you're also creating more impact. You can dramatically increase your income potential because your income is no longer limited to the number of hours in a day. It frees up time to focus on growing other areas of your business. So you're spending more energy working on your business rather than in it. It allows you to make the same or more money while working fewer hours for it. And because you're able to earn income from anywhere, any time, that means you can travel more, spend more time with family, all those nice things.\
\
[00:04:09.200] - Melissa\
So, if you're thinking, "Well, that's great, but how do I know it will work for me?" Unlike other types of business that have different barriers to entry, essentially anyone can create an online membership program. All you need is a computer and Internet access and some expertise that others are interested in. And you can create and manage a successful online membership program.\
\
[00:04:29.970] - Melissa\
Now, a lot of people get stuck here and think, "Well, I don't have an idea. I don't have something nobody else has already offered." But I'm confident that you can build a valuable membership program from what you already know and do and have to offer. And if you're not completely sure what that is yet, I'll give you some more tips on that in just a moment.\
\
[00:04:49.620] - Melissa\
Now, there are a gazillion different ways to structure an online membership program, but I'm going to highlight the four main types most membership programs fall into. So, you can think about which might be the best fit for your business.\
\
[00:05:01.290] - Melissa\
But before we get into those four different types, I just want to point out that each of them can be offered as either a free or paid product or is a supplement to an existing product or service you provide. Free membership programs are typically used as a strategy to grow an audience before you launch a higher level product. For example, back when I was a health coach starting a wellness company, I set up a free membership program to grow my audience while I built the paid products for my business.\
\
[00:05:28.880] - Melissa\
In doing that, I was able to build an audience of hundreds of interested people before even launching a product. So when it came time to launch my services, there were already people interested in even hearing about that. So, free membership programs do exist and can be a great way to grow your mailing list and your audience. That said, membership programs are most commonly paid programs that offer content of value for a specific fee. That could be either a one time fee in which your customer pays you and receives access to your program. Or it could be a subscription fee in which your customer pays monthly or annually for as long as they remain a member.\
\
[00:06:06.350] - Melissa\
It's also possible to create an online membership program that serves as a supplement to a different business offering you have elsewhere. For example, I worked with an organic family farm that has an existing audience of members who purchase weekly boxes of produce from their farm as a supplement to that physical product. The Farm started an online program for their members to access digital resources, things like; seasonal recipes that they can make with the produce they're receiving in their box; articles; and video tutorials on how to properly store or canned their produce; things like that.\
\
[00:06:38.360] - Melissa\
This isn't necessarily a free program, but it's also not paid for directly by members. They receive it as a benefit of another product or service they're already paying for. So, your online membership program could be free, paid or supplemental. And these are the different ways it could be; structured; a simple piece of protected content; a collection of protected content; and a resource library; an online course or training and a membership group.\
\
[00:07:06.840] - Melissa\
Protected content is the simplest version of an online membership program, if simply a specific piece of content that is only available to members, almost any type of content can be membership protected. Some examples are; an eBook; video training; a workbook; a Web page or a PDF download like a checklist or how to guide or other type of special content of value to your audience.\
\
[00:06:06.350] - Melissa\
This is an example from a fashion designer that membership protects their line sheets, which is a specific resource available only to their wholesale account members who are required to log in to access it.\
\
[00:07:42.590] - Melissa\
Next is a resource library, which is, in a sense a larger or more in-depth collection of protected content, usually around specific subject matter. It could include; Web pages; videos; audio files; or downloadable material like PDF or images; could even include a blog or a Podcast. An example of this as the wellness library I mentioned earlier, which is the resource library I set up to grow my audience by offering free, healthy living guides and resources, which I provided via both Web pages and downloadable guides and materials.\
\
[00:08:15.960] - Melissa\
Online courses are one of the more common membership program types, they could include a combination of Web pages, videos or downloadable material. The course could be a complete training, like one hour long video, or it could be broken up into a series of modules. Content can be accessible immediately or it can be gipped, making it available a specific amount of time after a member joins your program, for example, opening a new module each week or each month.\
\
[00:08:43.710] - Melissa\
Programs can be either ongoing, meaning that your members join at any point or they can be time specific and that they begin and end on specific dates and all members complete the program together. Courses are typically more time and resource intensive to build, but they can also be some of the most in-depth and the most valuable membership programs to offer.\
\
[00:09:03.840] - Melissa\
This example here is an online training I created with step by step instructions and tips and resources for setting up an online membership program. So, it's a DIY version of everything you do for my custom web design clients, which allows more people to work with me and offers a lower price point for those who need it.\
\
[00:09:22.730] - Melissa\
And finally, a membership group is something that could exist in and of itself as an online membership program, or it can serve as a supplement to an in-person or real life group that exists elsewhere. Like the example I shared earlier from the farm. Membership groups can involve a combination of features like, videos, web pages, articles, downloadable material, as well as an interactive forum, community directory or special links like access to a members only Facebook group.\
\
[00:09:50.710] - Melissa\
So, these are the four main types of online membership programs. You may find that several of them would work for your business, and that's great. It's certainly possible to host multiple different membership programs within your business. And that can be a way to serve specific segments of your audience or provide a tiered program offerings at different price points.\
\
[00:10:08.440] - Melissa\
So, now let's chat about the technology we'll need to do all of this. There are quite a few different platforms that allow you to build and sell an online membership program. First, one of the questions I get a lot is why we can't just put a password on a Web page and protect our content that way. Most website platforms like WordPress or Squarespace do allow you to password protect any page on your website, but it uses just one password to do that. So, you need to share the same password with all of your members and then they could share it with anyone they'd like as well. So, the protected content is not secure. This also means that if you built a membership program with more than one page, any navigation to different page would require members to submit a password again, which is not very user friendly.\
\
[00:10:52.730] - Melissa\
So it's just not a reasonable or effective method of membership protecting your content, which is why there are other tools out there to help.\
\
[00:11:01.010] - Melissa\
There are several popular online course creating platforms like Teachable Kajabi, Thinkific and Podia. They're known for simple and easy course creation. They typically have a nice interface and some fancy features. And you don't need a website to host your course because it's hosted directly on the platform itself. And they also have a built in sales page for you there.\
\
[00:11:21.500] - Melissa\
These tools do make online course creation easy, but there are a few drawbacks to be aware of, too. It can be somewhat of a detriment to have to host your course on an external platform instead of on your own website. But they do offer some ability to style your course to match your business's existing branding. It can be pretty limited and in most cases the user experience is a little choppy because it does take users away from your site to a third party site; and it looks like it's doing that.\
\
[00:11:48.260] - Melissa\
Most of these platforms are designed to support online courses. So, they're not there's not much flexibility in the other membership types I mentioned earlier, like resource archives or interactive membership groups.\
\
[00:12:01.130] - Melissa\
And even though for some people it can be a perk to create a membership program without having your own website for SEO purposes and to grow your business long term, you do want to have your own website anyway, and you don't want your sales page with all the key content about your program being hosted on someone else's website.\
\
[00:12:20.300] - Melissa\
So, those are just a few drawbacks to be aware of. But that said, many people use and like these platforms and they can be a great option if their limitations aren't an issue for you.\
\
[00:12:31.270] - Melissa\
The next option is to host your membership program on your own website. There are a few different ways of doing this, depending on the website platform you use. And I'll talk through those options in a moment.\
\
[00:11:01.010] - Melissa\
But first, just want to highlight a few of the benefits of hosting your membership content on your own website.\
\
[00:12:47.380] - Melissa\
One, you're able to retain your existing branding and create a more seamless user experience for your customers. It also gives you a bit more control over the content you're able to include in your program. The other tools do allow for a range of content as well. But this typically allows you to include anything in your membership program that you can host on your website, like videos, audio files, web pages, blog posts, PDF downloads, images, forums, directories, links, podcasts and probably something else I'm forgetting, too.\
\
[00:13:18.070] - Melissa\
You also have a lot more flexibility and control over the design and functionality of your program, how it will be structured and how users will flow through and experience it. And one of the things that many small business owners managing their own websites and technology like about this method is that it doesn't require you to learn a new platform. You can build and update your membership content directly on your existing website, SEO. If you're familiar with your website platform, you're good to go with building and managing your membership program as well.\
\
[00:13:47.920] - Melissa\
If you have a WordPress website .\
\
[00:13:49.480] - Melissa\
There are a couple membership plugin options that allow you to protect content on your website. Member press, restrict Content Pro or Learn Dash are all paid plugins that can be added to your WordPress website.\
\
[00:14:02.830] - Melissa\
Now, I'll be very honest. I designed exclusively on Squarespace. It's my favorite website platform for a lot of reasons and most of my membership building expertise is with regard to Squarespace. So, I'm not an expert on these particular WordPress plugins. But if you have a WordPress website and you plan on staying there, these are your current membership plugin options. And we'll get to another option for you in just a moment. Squarespace just released their very own native membership feature called Squarespace Member Areas, which allows you to create members only pages on your Squarespace website.\
\
[00:14:34.660] - Melissa\
This feature is an additional subscription that can be added on to any Squarespace website, if you'd like. It's definitely the easiest, quickest way to host membership protected pages on your Squarespace website. There are some functionality limitations to it, like the payment options you can offer and how you structure tiers of membership and how you engage with and communicate with members once they're in your program. So, I would say right now this is best for smaller, more simple membership programs, but it's definitely a great option to consider. If you have a Squarespace website. And there's also another option for membership, protecting content on any Web site platform. And it's called Member Space.\
\
[00:15:10.960] - Melissa\
And it happens to be my favorite memory space as a third party tool that allows you to membership protect pages and content like file downloads on your website, integrates with Squarespace, WordPress, Whibley, Wick's and a bunch of other website platforms, too.\
\
[00:15:28.330] - Melissa\
This is the membership method I have used most often for my clients because it has the most functionality and flexibility for designing many different types of membership programs. And also growing your membership program over time. It integrates nicely with a bunch of other business tools you might want to use for your membership program, like a members only forum, a member directory and members only Podcast and of course, your email marketing software so you can communicate with your program members.\
\
[00:15:55.150] - Melissa\
I would say I end up recommending this method probably eight to nine times out of ten for the different membership programs I come across and consult on.\
\
[00:16:04.330] - Melissa\
Now, which membership platform would be the most suitable for you? Depends on the type of membership program you're building. For example, if it's an online course or resource library or an interactive membership group where your website is already hosted and if you want to keep it there, the type of content you'll be included in your program, like videos or downloads or a members only blog and the payment options you'll need for your members.\
\
[00:16:30.470] - Melissa\
There are certainly cases in which each of these different tools would be the best fit. But like I said, I tend to recommend member space in most cases that I see because it works across many different website platforms and it has the most functionality and flexibility in terms of designing your content and member experience.\
\
[00:16:49.260] - Melissa\
Now to create a membership program, you will need a topic whether you already have an idea in mind or you'll need to do some brainstorming, here are some things you'll want to consider in choosing the topic of your program.\
\
[00:17:00.600] - Melissa\
First, think about what you know, what skills or areas of expertise do you have or do others tell you you're good at? Then think about what people need from you. What do they ask you for help with? What advice do you give over and over again? And third, consider what you enjoy doing. What do you do even though you don't get paid for it? What would you like to have time to do more of? And great topic for your membership program will be right here in the middle, a few tips as you think through potential topics for your membership program. Keep it simple, you can always add onto your program down the road. It is absolutely 100% okay and even encouraged that you start small and build up from there.\
\
[00:17:43.660] - Melissa\
With that in mind, if you have a very large topic idea. Think about how you can break it down into smaller, more specific and tangible pieces. You can always start with one and add to it over time to create an even larger, more comprehensive program or resource.\
\
[00:18:00.110] - Melissa\
If you have multiple topics that seem like viable contenders think through, which is likely to be the most useful to your target audience at this time. If one of your ideas is more advanced than the others, consider starting at the beginning and continuing to create and build additional course content as your audience makes their way through your content along with you. So, you start at a basic level and then add intermediate and advanced editions down the road when you've already built more of an audience that's looking for that.\
\
[00:18:28.560] - Melissa\
Make sure your idea aligns with your long term goals and you can sustain a business around it or easily fit it into your existing business, and you don't have to brainstorm alone, go ahead and phone a friend, ask your audience what's of interest to them. If you have an email list or a social media following a poll, if you're starting from scratch, reach out to people who know who you know in your field or among your target audience and ask them what their greatest challenge with it is or what they would love your help on.\
\
[00:18:59.240] - Melissa\
If you're a service provider consider your current limitations, what could you use help with right now? Are you unable to meet demand? Are there certain systems or processes your clients find useful that you could train them on? Is there a certain aspect of your work that you don't actually want to do one on one anymore and you could create a program for others to do it themselves?\
\
[00:19:20.360] - Melissa\
And listen to what people are already saying. The best program and service ideas are born out of meeting a need that already exists, solving a problem that people actually have and they know they have and are telling others about it.\
\
[00:19:35.330] - Melissa\
So, that is a quick overview of the technology options for hosting an online program and a few tips on choosing a topic idea that would work well for your business to help you get started on all of this, I am sharing my member space checklist, which includes all the steps of setting up a membership program on MemberSpace, which, of course, is my favorite method and generally the best option for most membership programs that I work with.\
\
[00:19:59.170] - Melissa\
And I'm also leaving a link here to the free membership building resources you can find on my website.\
\
[00:19:59.170] - Melissa\
And if you'd like more guidance and inspiration, including creating your own membership protected content, I outline literally all my best hopes in the membership lab, which is its own membership program on building membership programs. So, in addition to giving you a blueprint on the exact steps I use to create online membership programs for my clients, it's also a real life example program. So, you can see how everything comes together and functions.\
\
[00:20:28.280] - Melissa\
The Membership Lab includes six modules and video trainings, including; how to choose the best membership platform for your needs; How to brainstorm and validate your profitable topic idea; how to structure your program content; all the tech tips on building it out on your website; and it also includes instructions and best practices on creating a sales page and marketing your program, preparing for your program, launch and ongoing management of your program.\
\
[00:20:53.120] - Melissa\
The modules are broken up into quick little videos, so you can go through them at your own pace. And there are plenty of workbooks and downloads and an interactive planning and pricing template.\
\
[00:21:02.360] - Melissa\
And one of the features people say they appreciate the most is the Members Only Question portal, which is your direct access to me or my team. And any questions come up, whether it's about the technology or business strategy or you can't decide what to name or price your program. Really, any membership billing questions you have? We are there to help.\
\
[00:21:23.150] - Melissa\
The Membership Lab was designed for Squarespace users and all of the tutorials use Squarespace Web sites as examples.\
\
[00:21:29.810] - Melissa\
But if you're planning to use MemberSpace, that awesome tool I keep mentioning, most of the training will still apply to you regardless of which website platform you're on. I am leaving the link here if you'd like to check it out or sign up. And if you're watching this training, you can use code Blogger for a special discount.\
\
[00:21:46.980] - Melissa\
So, I hope this was helpful and gives you some tangible tips you can use to get started with your own online membership program. Thank you for watching and feel free to reach out with any questions.\

\
**Transcript:**\
[00:00:12.010] - Melody\
Welcome to how to grow your recurring revenue for your membership, group, program or agency with retentions and referrals. Today, we're going to be covering how to identify the three most important numbers to grow that recurring revenue monthly, month over month. We're also going to talk about how to calculate your lost revenue and how you could be leaving money on the table if you don't actually look at your retention.\
\
[00:00:35.310] - Melody\
Number three, we're going to be talking about how to identify what your monthly recurring revenue number is to track your goals. Lastly, we're going to talk about how to use your existing customers to promote your services, products, and so much more. Here's what you probably already know. Students that stay in your program and implement actually grow your recurring revenue. If you have a membership or a group coaching program, you know how costly it is in time and money that it takes to actually acquire new customers. And there's actually some statistics and data that identify that new customers cost 5 to 25 times more. Meaning that if you've already put in the hard effort of actually getting new leads and new clients and new students, it really is more cost-effective to really support those customers long term.\
\
[00:01:31.790] - Melody\
Students that stay in your program and implement actually grows your recurring revenue. So, as I mentioned, if you have a membership or a group coaching program, you really want to focus on how to grow that recurring revenue. And that actually can be done in two ways get new customers or focus on helping your customers become repeat customers or customers for life. What you already know is that you've done the hard work.\
\
[00:01:58.180] - Melody\
You have a course, maybe a digital product, a membership or group coaching program, and you've gotten to the point where you've converted them into a sale. But the problem is, there's a lot of people who look at the entire customer journey as a one sided process. Meaning you get the customer and then what? You don't want to leave people hanging in order to just think only about the conversion, meaning people who actually purchase your products, memberships or coaching programs or services. You want to look at ways that actually leverage the entire customer journey from start to finish.\
\
[00:02:35.090] - Melody\
As I mentioned, you lose potential clients at each stage. This means that if you're doing the hard work of generating traffic through, let's say, social media, search engine optimization, from your blog post, maybe a YouTube channel, or even a podcast, you've done all that hard lifting of getting people to the page. Why not actually help to optimize the back end of your customer journey? So, here in this visual, I'm actually breaking down an example of what that might look like. And keep in mind, these numbers are completely made up. This is just an example of what this could look like for you if you have an existing audience and you're already generating folks to join your email list or newsletter and get them to learn more about your services and products.\
\
[00:03:23.040] - Melody\
So, let's say that you have 2000 landing page visits to your home page. From the home page, people then opt in to your free resource. These convert to, let's say 600 leads. Then from there, maybe you have a master class or you have a webinar. There's 240 people that watch that webinar. From there, there's 24 applications to your one on one services, or maybe your high ticket group coaching program or your membership. From there, let's say that you have a pretty low conversion rate. Two to four conversions are actually being available to you at the time of all that hard work. Now, again, all of these conversions and metrics are all just an example. Your conversion rate might be higher or lower and your traffic again could be higher or lower than this. So again, keep that in mind. But as I'm showing you in this visual, you are losing potential clients at each stage. What I want to talk about today is how important it is to think about customer retention.\
\
[00:04:27.610] - Melody\
Customer retention is highly profitable. If we already took a look at how we're losing customers at each stage, we really need to think about the entire customer journey. This visual is something called the bow tie funnel. And I really think it's important to think about the overall customer journey of where your customers are not only joining you at the beginning stages of them getting to know you, but also how you can get your customers to become customers that will be repeat business and grow your recurring revenue month over month. Now, if you're at all aware of the customer journey, some people like to call it a funnel.\
\
[00:05:05.190] - Melody\
I think about this as the entire relationship that you have with your customers throughout the time that you are connected with them. Let's say that someone starts with just some simple brand awareness. This could be anything from social media posts. It could be even in person events, virtual events. This is getting people to understand a little bit more about you, what your brand is about and how you can support them in achieving their goals.\
\
[00:05:31.940] - Melody\
From there, they might be interested in your specific business that might look like interest by looking at your website, following you on social media, or joining your newsletter. From there, you might also have some engagement, maybe somebody comments on your social media posts. You might also then have people join your newsletter and then they decide, hey, what's the next step in working with you? This consideration stage is very, very critical and most marketers focus specifically from the consideration phase into the purchase phase, meaning they're only looking for that top dollar sale. But in reality, no matter what kind of business that you are operating, we want to look at the overall customer cycle. This means that we need to focus not only on what happens when the customer joins you, but what happens at the end of that customer journey.\
\
[00:06:28.190] - Melody\
And that is the beauty of the bow tie funnel. You get people to purchase. They complete an onboarding process with you. They adopt that product, meaning they actually consume the content that you work so hard to create. If you have a digital course, you know what I mean, they advocate for you because they love your product. And you also endear them to customer loyalty, meaning that they're not only looking at ways that they can work with you for that one time course or purchase, they're looking at working with you and a deeper level within a membership group coaching program or some sort of recurring revenue stream.\
\
[00:07:05.450] - Melody\
Another way to look at this is really, again, focusing on what happens after the sale. You have that post purchase, people are using the product, meaning they're actually consuming whatever it is that you created and you build that brand loyalty. Over time, they're going to advocate for you. And that's the beauty of referrals. People will really recommend people to the products and services that they really enjoy. If you have an official referral program, this is where you can actually grow your recurring revenue to promote your products and services in a way that makes sense for you, your business and your overall customer journey.\
\
[00:07:45.750] - Melody\
Now, what happens when someone actually is trying to consume your course or your product or your membership or your group program? Sometimes people ask me what can I do to help my customers see success? I know that my customers really do need all of the key pieces inside my curriculum, but they're not taking action. What I find often is the case to get people to engage in the curriculum is really not focusing on the completion of the course, but it's actually helping people achieve smaller bite sized pieces of information. So, I do have a habit, and I will admit this, of always wanting to over stuff my course content.\
\
[00:08:29.620] - Melody\
That may mean something like adding another module. But what we really want to do is you want to break this down. And here on the right side, you're going to see a visual that says big learning goal, smaller goal and then learning objective.\
\
[00:08:42.940] - Melody\
Essentially what this is is it's a breakdown of the most important pieces of information that's going to be broken down. So, people can take a ladder. Meaning they're going to take miniature steps towards the overall outcome of the course or program. These are what I consider milestones for the customers. You break down the outcomes and goals into stepping stones or milestones for your customers. This might look like one, breaking things down to help people see the foundations of your curriculum. Two, actually showing people a quick how to, something that can be accomplished in less than ten minutes, ideally less than five. Three, something that people can actually see success, and then four, they'll be able to get one step closer or a few steps closer to achieving their goal.\
\
[00:09:32.270] - Melody\
So you see, this is the kind of ladder that we want people to look at. They're moving through each step. They're seeing success. And you create that momentum for people to see that your framework works for them. Now the real question is, how do you keep the customer that you already have? Let's say, you have an online course and you want them to join your membership or you want them to join your group coaching program. Well, the first thing we need to do is how do we keep that customer buying from us and how do we support them achieving their goals?\
\
[00:10:06.990] - Melody\
Because we want to create that momentum and that relationship that's going to support their overall growth goals. Now let's say you have a membership and you're thinking, well, the people in my membership or the people in my group coaching program have a lot of momentum, but they're just not actually staying in my membership. They're canceling. They're not really taking action.\
\
[00:10:32.000] - Melody\
How can I keep these folks that have worked so hard to get inside of the membership or group coaching program? Or rather, if you're just starting with the membership or group coaching program, what should you think about to keep people from staying and actually implementing? We want to think about this in two ways. We're planning for people to stay in our membership or we are analyzing why people are not staying. Okay.\
\
[00:10:59.960] - Melody\
So, we're looking at this in a way that we want to grow that recurring revenue stream. So, we need to find out how much money are we losing or how much money could we lose if we don't focus on it?\
\
[00:11:09.910] - Melody\
So, what is churn? Churn is basically the rate at which we're losing customers. Obviously, the more people in our membership or group coaching program, the more that we grow our recurring revenue.\
\
[00:11:21.120] - Melody\
What we want to do is actually is do a little bit of a math problem here. And don't worry, I'm going to walk you through this. If you're not actually a good person at math, I have a free calculator that helps calculate all of this. And here's really the key. You want to calculate lost revenue by customers lost during the month over the customers at the beginning of the month. If you have a membership between forty seven dollars to ninety seven dollars or more, this revenue calculator is going to be really, really helpful for you. Again, thinking about customers lost during the month over customers at the beginning of the month. Your churn rate examples will be customers lost during the month over customers at the beginning of the month.\
\
[00:12:03.770] - Melody\
As an example, let's say that you have a thousand people inside of your program, 50 people were lost during the beginning or excuse me, at the end of the month. And that calculates to a churn rate of 5%. So, conversely, if someone's saying hey, I want to have people staying my membership long term, churn is bad. We don't want people leaving the membership if they truly can benefit from your program.\
\
[00:12:29.230] - Melody\
And what we want to do is actually decrease that number. We want to decrease our churn rate and increase our retention. I want to talk specifically about how this relates to your goals to grow your recurring revenue. So, there's two things we want to focus on growing our revenue but also keeping the members that we have already inside. So, we're going to enter in our new monthly retention goal.\
\
[00:12:54.170] - Melody\
So, again, we're talking about is retention is good, churn rate is bad. Every single month, we need to increase our retention, keeping the members in and we want to help the people see success. So that overall our annual retention goal is actually increasing and not decreasing. So, we want to keep our members inside and we want to keep that retention goal a decent percent. And then what we're going to do is enter the total amount of annual recovered revenue. Because once you recover some potential leads that have really not actually taken action. Let's say that, you know, you have a retention goal of 5% increase over the course of one year and you want to see how much money you could bring back. That number for the recovered revenue is going to actually show you how much money inside the calculator you could be making.\
\
[00:13:56.750] - Melody\
So, let's say your recovered revenue is $2,000 or $20,000, especially if you have a high ticket group coaching program if you keep just 5%. So, this is just an example of that breakdown. Number two, important, number two review is your monthly recurring revenue. This is the total number of customers that you have multiplied by the average price. MRR is another way of saying monthly recurring revenue. Obviously, the higher, the better. So, what do you want to do to grow your recurring revenue? Well, you have to look at where you are now and where you want to be.\
\
[00:14:40.280] - Melody\
Are people staying in your membership? If you haven't created your membership yet, what do you need to do to help people see success? And then alternatively and additionally, we want to think about your revenue for your goals. Are you looking at growing your recurring revenue? Let's say, you have a membership and you're making $500 a month in recurring revenue. Do you want to make a $1,000 next month in recurring revenue? Well, we need to plan that out and we have to focus on these key numbers. Another important number is to consider your calculated monthly ARPA or average revenue per account.\
\
[00:15:23.080] - Melody\
So, basically, you want to think about how much is the average product price or the average revenue that's generated per client account. Now, there's a lot of different tools and resources that I'm going to include in a worksheet to show you some important numbers and how to access this. But I do want to recommend that you take a look at finding out what's the average revenue per account.\
\
[00:15:45.920] - Melody\
That has a lot to do with your products, your pricing, and a lot more. The other thing you want to think about is your customer lifetime value.\
\
[00:15:55.010] - Melody\
This is the total worth to a business of a customer over the whole period of their relationship. So, imagine if you were Starbucks and your calculated customer lifetime value would be the length of the time that someone is a consumer of Starbucks, right? So, obviously, the higher the customer lifetime value, the higher the profits because you did all this marketing, somebody actually bought from you and they're now going to come to you again and again. So, customer lifetime value is another thing that you want to increase.\
\
[00:16:28.020] - Melody\
Now, if you want to grow your recurring revenue with repeat clients, I definitely recommend taking notes on this next step. We talked about repeat business and how profitable that is for your business revenue overall. Some examples of expansion revenue from your existing customer base are essentially these three examples, but these are just the start. You probably may already be doing this or thinking about doing this, but this is really what businesses do to grow their revenue. Number one is annual or quarterly retreats. If you're thinking about having a retreat either in person or virtual, this is a great way for you to expand your customer revenue base. Number two, a monthly membership.\
\
[00:17:09.760] - Melody\
This can be something specific to growing your recurring revenue for your membership or creating an additional package pricing for your membership, therefore creating a new revenue stream based off of your existing services that you offer for your clients. You can also offer a VIP day or a one on one intensive. There are plenty of ways for you to grow your recurring revenue based off of your existing customers. So, if you're wondering what expansion revenue is, it's basically booked revenue outside of the original initial purchase, product or service. So, for example, your first product could be a mini-course. From the mini-course, you can then introduce them to a group coaching program. From the group coaching program, you might then expand that to a retreat. From the retreat, you might expand that to a one on one intensive, VIP day, a retainer for a service, et cetera. You can go on and on. Expansion revenue is profitable and we want to grow it over time. There are two types of expansion revenue.\
\
[00:18:11.190] - Melody\
Many of which you probably have heard of or are familiar with these terms, upselling and cross-selling. Essentially, what you're doing is you're providing an additional option for people to work with you either in an automated fashion, like through a funnel or customer journey, or through a way where people can actually learn about something that's complementary to the services that you're offering, like cross-selling. So, upselling might be, hey, if you want to grab access to the membership, you can also license part of it where you can use it for your clients, add an additional fee that would be upselling, you're consuming more of that product. Again, if you think about when you go to a restaurant, they might say, hey, do you want to supersize this? It's using generally more of what you're already using. Cross-selling is maybe a fries where you're actually saying hey, I would like it if you liked the burger, you might also want to consider grabbing the fries. So, this could be the bump sell offer or an upsell, which is a completely different product from the original product that you're selling. So, again, lots of different things to think about. Now, here's some simple ways that you can do to boost profits and engagement from your existing customer base with a referral program, I like to use something called a referral packet, but other people like to call it something else.\
\
[00:19:37.290] - Melody\
So, what you want to do is you want to create a way that's easy and simple for people to learn more about your services and refer you business through a very streamlined way. You can send referrals to a complete onboarding packet. You can ask your referral team to send people to your free lead magnet. So, this is something that I do within my affiliate software, which is a tool that I use where I actually send people directly to a free lead magnet. Or if I'm doing something live like a challenge or some sort of training series, I recommend that the affiliates or referral folks actually send people to that direct link that's customized to the specific user or referral partner. Another thing that you can do is growing your income with a low ticket product, this could be either a mini course, a masterclass, or freebie. You can also send people directly through a booking page or to your Facebook group. There's so many different ways that you can send people to the newsletter and grow your email list and also grow your sales. So, lots of ways to grow your referral program.\
\
[00:20:48.830] - Melody\
The referral packet I talked about is just a great way to also use the customers that have already seen the success from your membership or your group coaching program or your products, and actually, using that resource to help promote your products to build that brand advocacy. You can add in additional information like how to sign up for your referral program, payout details, and marketing assets like graphics, et cetera. Lots of different ways. All right. So, we have talked quite a bit about ways to grow your recurring revenue. We've talked about how you can not only grow your recurring revenue, we talked about ways that you can increase your profitability by using retention. We talked about some important numbers like your average revenue per account, your monthly recurring revenue number, and how it's important to think about this in context with supporting your customers, so that they can actually advocate for you and become a customer long term.\
\
[00:21:52.090] - Melody\
We also talked about how to grow your recurring revenue and how you can use expansion revenue to build off of the customer base that you already have.\
\
[00:22:01.660] - Melody\
We talked about some numbers and key calculations, so there's a free calculator that I have. I'm going to share a little bit more about this later on, but it is a calculator. You can take a look at it. It's called the retention, calculator. It's entering all the numbers that you have that you can calculate the retention calculator of what you can do to customize your retention long term.\
\
[00:22:25.240] - Melody\
So while we've talked a lot about this, you're probably wondering I need some help to actually grow my group coaching program. And I want to be able to leverage word-of-mouth referrals and also support my ongoing efforts in my business with retention. One of the things that you can do to grow your recurring revenue is network with other course creators and digital product owners. Podcast guests are also another great way to get word out about your products and programs. One of the things that you can do is head on over to the thecourseconsultant.com/coursecollaborationdirectory, and you'll be able to share about your specific offers by listing your business in a free online business directory.\
\
[00:23:19.240] - Melody\
This is perfect for you. If you have a course, you have a coaching program, you really want to get the word out about what it is that you do, and you want to use networking and opportunities to engage with other course creators within the group and it's a really awesome resource to check out. Also, if you found some of the information here useful, I am going to be including a free worksheet that you can use some of these calculations to grow your recurring revenue. So, make sure to check out the workbook activity where it's going to go more in-depth into the activities referenced from today.\
\
[00:23:58.650] - Melody\

**Transcript:**\
[00:00:13.550] - Monica\
Hi. I am so excited to be a part of the Blogger Breakthrough Summit and that I get the opportunity to share with you my best tips and methods of creating a high converting sales page. When I talk about creating a high converting sales page, I am referring to a sales page for digital products. Are you familiar with digital products? Digital products are a huge, untapped market online, and my goal for this training is to help you get one step closer to creating a new, profitable revenue stream.\
\
[00:00:42.280] - Monica\
With the tips I share with you on how to create a high converting sales page. My name is Monica Froese and I run two websites. The first is Redefining Mom, which is a site dedicated to helping moms thrive in both motherhood and business. And the second is Empowered Business, where I empower women to achieve financial freedom through creating six figure digital product businesses. Are you ready to get started? So before we dive in, let's make sure that we are on the same page and define exactly what a digital product is.\
\
[00:01:11.890] - Monica\
A digital product is an asset that you create, ones that you can sell over and over again. It's highly profitable because the majority of the work is done one time. Examples of this would be ebooks spreadsheets, printables website templates or digital courses. A digital product is simply a solution to someone's problem. Now to understand why, how and why I am sharing with you my tips on creating high converting sales pages.\
\
[00:01:37.030] - Monica\
I think it's important to know, first, who the heck am I? And two, why should you listen and take my advice on creating a sales page? So, let me tell you a little bit about me and my experience with digital products. I started creating digital products in 2016, and the very first product I created was the family budget spreadsheet. I had been blogging on Redefining Mom at the time for about three years and not making much money.\
\
[00:02:02.980] - Monica\
I was just too busy at my corporate job to spend time monetizing, but I still had some really cool opportunities, like going on Fox News and being invited to the White House to meet President Obama. I finally decided to quit my corporate job in 2016 and focus on my online and digital product business. Now, right around that time, I started somewhat of a movement, a new way to sell digital products that no one else was doing, and it's become pretty popular in my online business circles. I began teaching my students about the triple dip funnel, and now I click on digital product sales pages from places like Facebook ads and Pinterest ads.\
\
[00:02:37.960] - Monica\
And I get to see my brainchild come to life.\
\
[00:02:40.140] - Monica\
And it's pretty amazing. Now, before I get ahead of myself here, you might be completely lost about all this talk about sales funnels. So, let's take some time to define a few important terms so that you don't get overwhelmed. As I explain how the triple funnel can help you to sell more digital products. I want to make sure we are on the same page.\
\
[00:03:00.270] - Monica\
Okay. So, let's talk about a sales funnel at each step of the funnel, you're going to lose people because not everyone will take the next step in the funnel process. Sales funnel is just a simple way for referring to the buying journey. It's how you get someone from point A to point B. So, let's think about this in terms of how a traditional brick and mortar business works.\
\
[00:03:25.080] - Monica\
Yes, even traditional brick and mortar businesses have a sales funnel. Now, in this example, I'm going to talk about the new bike that I recently bought. The sales funnel process is a five step process. So, on top of the funnel is step one the problem. Now, here's what the problem was.\
\
[00:03:42.490] - Monica\
In this scenario, our family likes to go on bike rides and my mountain bike was super uncomfortable. I had to stay hunched over the handlebars, my neck aches. My butt hurt for days. Since I'm so uncomfortable, I never want to take bike rides with my kids.\
\
[00:03:56.450] - Monica\
I was telling a friend about this problem and she suggested that I go to a local bike shop to see what options they had for me. So, step two of the sales funnel process is research. Now, in the old days, I would have taken out a handy phone book and started calling around to different bike shops. But since it's the 21st century, I did a quick Google search and found a bike shop right around the corner from my house. Now step three is the solution.\
\
[00:04:21.780] - Monica\
At the bike shop, I started browsing the different bike options and landed on what they call a gazelle bike. It seems like it would solve all of the complaints I had with my current bike, but I wasn't quite sure. So that leads us to step four of the sales funnel process, the education. A nice employee named Mike educates me on the features of the gazelle bike. I learn how the handlebars are set to keep me upright while I ride and how the seats are much more comfortable than my mountain bike.\
\
[00:04:47.140] - Monica\
And then step five is the sale. Mike sold me with his expert knowledge and I am now the proud owner of a gazelle bike and plan to return soon to buy my daughter a new bike as well. So, the end result is this. At each step of this process, I needed to be convinced to take the next step. My friend told me that there were better bike options.\
\
[00:05:08.060] - Monica\
Google told me that there was a bike shop near my house. The bike shop had hundreds of bikes to choose from. Mike was knowledgeable and addressed all my concerns. I decided to buy a bike from Mike at the local bike shop. Now in online marketing, the process of convincing someone to take an action is known as a conversion.\
\
[00:05:24.890] - Monica\
If you end with the sale, what happens is you earned a conversion, you earn that sale. So, not everyone who has the problem that you're trying to solve with your digital product is going to end up buying from you. And that is why a sales funnel is simply an upside down triangle. Now, while I was finally starting to make money with my digital products, I started to realize a lot about running a profitable digital product business and the tricks and techniques I use on my sales pages that seem to do better than others.\
\
[00:05:54.480] - Monica\
So, over the years, I took notes of all the details that converted versus what didn't and came up with a very unique sales funnel called the Triple Dip Funnel.\
\
[00:06:03.830] - Monica\
Now, the Triple Dip funnel is a three part sales funnel that attracts cold traffic. In other words, people who don't know you to a sales page and offers two options to buy. It offers two options which you either buy or you sign up for freebie at the end. Okay, so it's a sales page. The objective is buy from me, but if they don't, they can sign up for a freebie at the end.\
\
[00:06:27.740] - Monica\
So that's two parts of the funnel. The third part of the funnel is if they opt in for the freebie at the end, they are taken to a triple dip page, which is a limited time offer. So why is this so powerful? Well, it's powerful because you have the ability to use your sales page to educate your potential customers by producing a lot of different types of elements on that page that are interactive and educational and inspirational all at the same time. So that's what we're going to talk about today.\
\
[00:07:02.130] - Monica\
There are 13 critical components to include on the Triple Dip sales page that are proven to increase your sales page conversions. In other words, make more money. Are you ready to hear them?\
\
[00:07:20.050] - Monica\
Number one, a catchy hook. On top of the sales page, you're going to actually state what the problem is and what you're selling. You're going to want to have a catchy tagline for the product. Number two, high quality product images. There are six ways to inspire action through product images, and I'm going to walk through those real quick.\
\
[00:07:40.940] - Monica\
The first one is high quality photos. Photos should be high resolution and professional. This alone will help you stand above others, especially photos that are unique to your brand and not stock photos. The second way to inspire action through your product images is to show real life solutions. And what I mean by this is show your product being used in real life.\
\
[00:08:02.940] - Monica\
Even if it's a digital product, it's something that is being used. One of the ways I do this is I do a photo shoot every year with a local photographer where I'm on my computer using my digital assets, and she's taking pictures of that. Now the third way to inspire action through product images is flat lays. Flat lays are a great way to showcase digital products. I get all my digital assets printed and I have my photographer take flat lays for me and I style them with on brand colored confetti notebook staplers.\
\
[00:08:31.120] - Monica\
It depends what your digital product is, but let's say that you have a meal planner that you sell. You can print out the meal planner, bind it at something like, at a place like Office Max and then display it, put it on your kitchen counter and have all the different things that you use for meal planning around that to take pictures. You can even do this with your Iphone. Now the fourth way to inspire action through product images is mockups. Mockups are a great way to showcase your solution.\
\
[00:08:59.090] - Monica\
Think of things like 3D covers for an ebook, or you could even if you sell something like a spreadsheet, you could use an imac display and insert a screenshot of the spreadsheet into it. That's called the product mockup, and that's something you can make online. Now the fifth way to inspire action through product images is to use compelling text overlays. Text overlays are a great way to communicate what your solution is about. So, if you have multiple components to your product, you can actually label what they are for.\
\
[00:09:29.550] - Monica\
So, for example, with my family budget system, there is a debt pay off spreadsheet, a family budget spreadsheet. There's a principal pack, principal cash envelopes, and I use text overlays in the image and that goes above the fold. And it's a way to demonstrate that there are multiple items inside of the system. Now the 6th way to inspire action through product images is to use gifs. Gifs are moving images.\
\
[00:09:57.450] - Monica\
So, for example, if you're selling an ebook, you could show the pages flipping. I've taken flat layers that I've created and made a gif image from them. It rotates through the different images and each image shows a different feature of the product. Okay, number three is ask a compelling question. So, asking compelling questions that will get your visitors mind thinking about why they need this product. This is where you want to put yourself in the shoes of your customer and think about the problem that they are facing for launching into what your product is actually about.\
\
[00:10:32.810] - Monica\
So ,for example, here's what I say on the Family Budget Spreadsheet sales page. I ask questions like, do you know how much money you have left after each paycheck? Six or even twelve months from now? Do you spend less than 30 minutes a month paying your bills and working on your budget? Do you know where you stand financially, where when an unexpected expense happens?\
\
[00:10:54.820] - Monica\
Or do you have a plan to get out of debt? And then I say, if you answered no to any of these questions, the family budget spreadsheet can help you. So, what you're doing is you're setting the frame of mind for them to understand where they're at and that you have something that's going to help them solve what that problem is. Number four is relevant customer testimonials. \
\
[00:11:17.030] \
So, customer testimonials are a great fit for showing that other people are happy with your product, but they can also be used to highlight the most important benefit of your product. The first customer testimonial should touch on the number one pinpoint that your problem solves and really draw that out. Your most compelling testimonials should stand on its own and be pretty high up on the sales page. Number five, relate to the customer. In this section, you're going to connect with your customers struggle. They might be frustrated, overwhelmed, sad.\
\
[00:11:49.090] - Monica\
You need to understand their emotions. Talk to them as you would a friend and let them know that you understand what their pain point is and let them know that they deserve a solution. And of course, the solution is going to be to buy your product. Number six, what's inside your product? Demonstrate what the product is in video format.\
\
[00:12:11.120] - Monica\
You can also take that video and put it on YouTube and link it to your sales page. So, for example, with the family budget spreadsheet, the video walks through each tab and has a text overlay showing the benefits of each tab and what each tab does. The video demonstrates how the spreadsheet benefits you, and there's music playing in the background. Of course, there are fun transitions and pictures added in. But if this scares you and you're like, I have no idea how to create a video.\
\
[00:12:36.560] - Monica\
Yeah, me neither. My first video was created by someone on Upwork. Underneath this section of what's inside, I recommend putting your very first buy button for the product. Number seven is key benefits. Now let's move into the key benefits of buying the product.\
\
[00:12:57.150] - Monica\
This is a good place to put 'imagine if' statements. So imagine if you could pay off your student loans because you've finally got to handle on your finances. That's an example of what I'm talking about. With 'imagine if' statements, you're not giving features.\
\
[00:13:14.290] - Monica\
Not yet. We will be doing that instead. What you're doing is explaining the benefits of your solution. Okay, now let's talk about key features. Under the benefits, you can list the key features of the product.\
\
[00:13:26.750] - Monica\
This is a more practical section. An example of this would be you'll get a 15 Google sheet, spreadsheet, or 25 printable pages. This is the actual the practical meat of what they're going to receive when they download your digital product. But here's a pro tip. All along you're going to be including visual images of the product. And anytime you can show before and after a picture of the transformation that your product delivers.\
\
[00:13:55.550] - Monica\
Do it. Because this is all about showing the transformational value of your digital product. So, underneath the key features, I recommend adding your second buy button. Number nine, more customer testimonials. A testimonial section is where you'll display things like screenshots from Facebook. If you have a Facebook group, you probably have people in there talking about how great your product is.\
\
[00:14:18.530] - Monica\
Always screenshot with people DM you on Facebook or on Instagram. If customers respond to emails letting you know that your product is great and how it helped them, screenshot that, or you can even reach out to your customers and ask them how the product has helped them and then ask for a headshot to go along with their testimonial. Number ten, frequently asked questions. This section is all about addressing commonly asked questions that are practical and addressing common objections. For example, a practical question would be, can I use this spreadsheet with Excel?\
\
[00:14:53.440] - Monica\
Overcoming an objection would be, I'm not very good with spreadsheets. Will this product work for me? Number eleven include a bio section. This is where you're going to tell people about you and why you are qualified to create the product that you're selling. You want to make sure that your bio section helps build that know, like and trust factor, and it's about how you can help them.\
\
[00:15:20.220] - Monica\
In essence, your bio is actually more about them than you. It's about how you're helping them while also making sure that you convey that you're qualified to help them. Number twelve, the final Buy Now section. Now it's time to move into getting them actually to hit the Buy button. This is the final pitch for the product.\
\
[00:15:38.780] - Monica\
You're going to include another image of the product, list the major features and end with a Buy Now button. Now, let's say someone does decide to buy from the sales page. They'll check out and they'll be sent a welcome email from you about the product. Now the transaction is done. They bought the product.\
\
[00:15:56.850] - Monica\
They are a customer of yours and you have the ability to communicate with them down the road and encourage future sales. But what happens if someone gets to the bottom of the sales page and decides that they are not ready to buy from you yet? And this is where number 13 is the key critical component to the entire Triple Dip sales funnel page. I call it the Freebie section. This is the second part of the Triple Dip funnel formula.\
\
[00:16:25.090] - Monica\
They get to the end of the sales page and they're not ready to buy. Okay, so to account for people who land on the page but are not familiar with you, you want to give them an opportunity to get on your email list with a freebie. The way I see it, if you're not ready to buy from me right now, I still want to be able to nurture our relationship in the future. With the Triple Dip funnel, your main objective is to get the sale and then your secondary objective is to collect their email address for future nurturing. At the end of the page.\
\
[00:16:57.280] - Monica\
I see something like not sure yet at least don't leave empty handed.\
\
[00:17:01.730] - Monica\
Then I include a picture of the Freebie and a sign up button to claim it. Remember, the people who are going to land on this page are not familiar with you. You don't want to lose the ability to be able to sell to them later, even if they're not ready to buy right now. If they decide to opt in for your freebie, which by the way, is directly related to the product, what the product is about, then they're going to be taken to the third part of the triple Dip, which is the limited time offer on the product that they just read on your sales page.\
\
[00:17:30.230] - Monica\
So, what I'm going to do now is actually show you an example of a triple Dip sales funnel page that converts very high for me so that you can get an idea of what this looks like in real time.\
\
[00:17:46.630] - Monica\
Let's look at a real example of what a triple dip sales funnel page looks like. I recently changed up this page and I'm testing. I believe it's really important to test different page layouts, but all of the essential elements that I talked about are still on this page. So, when you land on this page, now, keep in mind, a lot of people are going to land on this page, probably on a mobile device. I am on a very big Imac display right now.\
\
[00:18:12.090] - Monica\
So that is why it looks so big. Now when you land on this page, the first thing that you're seeing is two things. If you're on desktop, you're seeing a product mockup, so you're able to see immediately what exactly the family budget system is. There's a family budget spreadsheet, a debt tracker, printable cash envelopes, and I'm introducing the product to you. And then also there is a see what's inside with a video and a call to action button to sign up right away.\
\
[00:18:44.710] - Monica\
Then I launch into this. Does this sound familiar? And this is where I'm connecting with the potential customer and getting in the mindset of what they're struggling with and what they deserve to be different if they had control and a handle over their family finances. And then I introduced them to good news. The ultimate family budget system is here to help you and I explain how it can help them.\
\
[00:19:13.790] - Monica\
And then we have testimonials. Now we go into the practicality of everything that's included, breaking down each product in the bundle. And I have a nice price graphic showing them that they're going to save money and sign me up by now. Button another testimonial, the bio section explaining who I am, why you should trust me, why, if this works for me, it will work for you.\
\
[00:19:38.390] - Monica\
I explained practically how the spreadsheet works. It works on the go. It's super easy to use. I have the frequently asked questions section where I'm overcoming objections. I'm asking those literal questions.\
\
[00:19:52.510] - Monica\
More testimonials and the final Buy Now section. Now you probably see underneath my face over here, there's social proof notifications that are coming up, like right there. See social proof notifications. That's a really great way to validate that people are actually buying your product. Those I used a tool called Wiser, notify for.\
\
[00:20:12.400] - Monica\
Okay, so this whole part of the sales page that we just looked at the Triple Dip, this is part one of the Triple Dip. I am educating you on how the family budget system can help you manage your family finances. The goal here is to get you to click the Buy button. Okay. If you don't click the Buy button, this is the second part of the Triple Dip funnel. Not sure yet.\
\
[00:20:36.350] - Monica\
At least don't leave empty handed. Try out our free budget planner printables. And if they end up opting in for the free budget planner printables on the next page, they're going to be offered a limited time discount on the family budget spreadsheet. So, the second part of the Triple Dip funnel is right here. If they're not ready to buy, you still want their email address, so you can still communicate with them.\
\
[00:21:04.380] - Monica\
And the third part is offering that product on a limited time offer.\
\
[00:21:12.350] - Monica\
Okay, so to recap, the entry point for your Triple Dip Sales funnel page is anywhere you get leads from. Facebook, Pinterest, YouTube, anytime that you're going to encounter people who have a problem. And then you have a product that solves that problem, you're going to want to drop the link to your Triple Dip Sales funnel page. Step one is you ask for the sale. It's a sales page. Step two is you offer a freebie in exchange for their email. Step three is the thank you limited time offer page.\
\
[00:21:38.920] - Monica\
You're going to offer that same product at a special price. And the beauty of this is that you're essentially duplicating the Triple Dip page, which you can do in two simple clicks with most landing page builder, we use lead pages. My suggestion for the limited time Offer page is to use a 20 minutes countdown to produce urgency. Another suggestion is to offer a downsize product if you don't want to discount the product from your main sales page.\
\
[00:22:05.090] - Monica\
So, implementing this type of sales page into my business dramatically changed everything. I went from a 90% bounce rate off of my sales pages to 10% to 20% of people buying the product. Now let me explain what that means real quick. 90% of the people who landed on my sales page never took action. They would just bounce off the page.\
\
[00:22:28.170] - Monica\
They would read it and not do anything. Now instead, 10% to 28% of people go on to buy the product, and roughly 30% to 50% end up opting into the freebie. So, generally speaking, 45% to 70% of people who land on my sales pages that don't know anything about me still take an action. Now, out of the people who opt in for my freebies at the end of the page, they go on to convert at an average of 70% on the tripwire page. These are really good numbers.\
\
[00:22:57.350] - Monica\
It has also helped me to grow my email list, which I strongly believe is the most powerful tool that you have in your business for growing a loyal community and making money. The triple Funnel sales page helped me solve two major issues that I was experiencing. One, it allowed me to be educational instead of literal in the sales process, meaning I'm not going to just give you a bunch of product tax and tell you literally what's in the product. Instead, I'm going to inform you how my product is transformational.\
\
[00:23:29.270] - Monica\
And the second problem it solved was I get more leverage out of my website traffic now.\
\
[00:23:34.360] - Monica\
I can continue to communicate with my sales page visitors through email and eventually nurture them into a sale, whether or not they bought from me outright in the beginning or not. So, what do you think? The triple Dip Funnel page is pretty cool, right?

**Transcript:**\
[00:00:11.770] - Monica\
Hi. Welcome. I'm so excited you're here today to chat all about storefronts and sales funnels for digital products. Today's presentation will focus on the difference between storefronts and sales funnels for digital products and why you need both in your business.\
\
[00:00:26.200] - Monica\
They serve two different purposes, but both are very important. So, you may not know me yet, so let me introduce myself. My name is Monica Froese, and I run two websites. The first is Redefining Mom, which is a site dedicated to helping moms find their identity outside of motherhood. And the second is Empowered Business, where I help small businesses create profitable digital product businesses.\
\
[00:00:48.990] - Monica\
I've launched over 100 of my own digital products since 2016, and I've helped thousands of people do the same. Needless to say, I've learned a few things over the years, and I hope I can show you the power of using both a storefront and a sales funnel in your business. So, first, let's break down the most fundamental difference between a sales funnel and a shop. A sales funnel is a hyper specific buying journey meant to attract a cold, otherwise new audience to you. And a shop gives us a cohesive shopping experience, which is great for a warm audience. When someone is new to you, you don't want to confuse them by offering them too many options.\
\
[00:01:34.050] - Monica\
Plus, you need to educate them at the same time. So, a sales funnel is a great way to do this. In a shop, there are a lot of marketing triggers to entice you to add more to your cart and get you to spend more. But if they don't know who the heck you are, if they just land on your storefront and don't know anything about you or your brand, it can be a tough sell. Plus, there are many options in a store, so they can click around a lot.\
\
[00:01:57.660] - Monica\
And it's not a hyper-specific journey per se like a sales funnel is. So in a sales funnel, you make the choice easy. They have a specific problem, and you are offering them a specific solution. They either take it or they don't. So, let's break this down a little bit further.\
\
[00:02:15.530] - Monica\
This is my illustration of what a sales funnel is. It is an upside down triangle, and all a sales funnel really means is the customer journey. So when you think about acquiring a new or cold customer, somebody who doesn't know you yet in your business, it's easiest to think of it in terms of a funnel. At each step of the funnel, you lose people. So not everyone is going to take the next step in the funnel process.\
\
[00:02:38.880] - Monica\
That's why it's an upside down triangle. And it's also important why you want to have a super dialed in buying journey when the person doesn't know you. You don't want to give them too many choices, because if you give them too many choices, you will lose them. You confuse, you'll lose. So, at the top, when people come into your funnel, when they find you, the goal is at the very end, they're going to be buying the thing that you're offering.\
\
[00:03:03.140] - Monica\
In the digital product world, a digital product is simply a solution to their problem. So, they have now searched the solution, searched for a solution, they have a problem. They've searched for the solution, they found your digital product and they bought it. And that is what a sales funnel is designed to do. So, it will look generally something like this.\
\
[00:03:24.390] - Monica\
There's a free opt in. And then on the back end of the free opt in is a paid product, a tripwire, also known as a limited-time offer with an order bump. Sometimes there will also be an upsell that comes after that for something like a membership. And then after that, they'll get a follow up nurturing email from you. Now this is a great way to introduce someone new to you while giving them value at the same time, using this very specific buying journey.\
\
[00:03:52.590] - Monica\
You are not giving them choices because when they are new to you, you don't want to overwhelm them. So, let's look at an example of a sales funnel and then we'll compare it to an example of a shop to see the difference here. So here is an opt in for my free printable budgeting planner. When you come to this page, there is nothing else for you to do but hand over your email address for the free budget printable planner. Once you do that, you are redirected here to our limited-time offer tripwire page, where I'm offering you to take your budgeting digital with our family budget spreadsheet.\
\
[00:04:27.490] - Monica\
It is a $9 offer and I've been on the page for a while, so I have stopped the timer from running, from redirecting. So, I could show you this. But after 20 minutes, it redirects to a full price offer. So, for 20 minutes, you can get the spreadsheet for $9. And if you go ahead and click on the buy button, what's going to happen is you're going to be taken to the shopping cart.\
\
[00:04:50.030] - Monica\
Now there's only one thing that you can buy in the shopping cart, the family budget spreadsheet. And you can choose to add on the order bump, which is the debt payoff spreadsheet. But there are no other choices. So, the whole point of this is to not confuse new people. Now let's talk about the difference.\
\
[00:05:06.180] - Monica\
What looks different when you're in a storefront or a shop? Okay, so what is a storefront? It's a centralized location for all of your products. It grows with you as you build out multiple products, right? So, you don't have to build a new sales page.\
\
[00:05:24.060] - Monica\
You just have to create a new product listing. It has the ability to add multiple items to the checkout cart, right? Like I just showed you, the checkout cart for family budget spreadsheet. You were not adding additional items to it. You weren't in a shopping cart mentality.\
\
[00:05:38.340] - Monica\
And also, a shop gives you the ability to offer multiple marketing incentives to increase your average order value. So, when you're running a digital product shop, you're going to really care about producing marketing triggers inside of your shop that get people to add multiple things to the cart because you want to increase your average order value. If you increase your average order value with all of these tactics, by getting multiple products added to the cart, you can predict the trends of how much your shop will make in the future. So, now let me show you what a shop looks like in comparison to a sales funnel. When you are shopping in a shop, this is our empowered shop.\
\
[00:06:16.860] - Monica\
What will happen is there's multiple things that you can buy. So, this is the main page, but I'm just going to go to one of the categories just to illustrate my point here, so I can add a multitude of things to my shopping cart. So, let's just do this. We're going to add this and then let's go over here and we're going to add this, and then really cool things happen, which I'll show you later in the presentation that will help us increase our average order value. So, the point here is a sales funnel takes somebody who does not know you, provides a hyper specific buying journey.\
\
[00:06:50.940] - Monica\
In other words, they have a problem, you're giving them a specific solution, which is your digital product. You are not overwhelming them. In a storefront mentality, what you're doing is presenting all the things that you have to offer and they can add multiple things to their cart. And so, we break this down by sales funnel, new people, shop, existing audience.\
\
[00:07:15.930] - Monica\
So, I spent a long time in my business hyper focused on attracting new people to me through sales funnels. And that worked great because now I have a very big warm audience that wants to buy from me. I mean, who wouldn't like that? I would focus my attention on paid ads, showing up on Instagram, participating in Summits like these, and large bundle opportunities. And in all of those instances, I needed to give my new customer a specific buying journey.\
\
[00:07:43.150] - Monica\
So, I did not overwhelm them. However, I was running into an issue. I only have so much email bandwidth, meaning I could only direct people to so many places in my emails once I formed a relationship with them. So, what would happen is that I would create a new product or host a new workshop, and I could really only tell people about it once or maybe a few times a year. As my email list grew, so did my product suite.\
\
[00:08:07.380] - Monica\
I am always coming up with new products, which are solutions for my audience. And it got to the point where I had 40 plus sales pages and no centralized way for people to buy from me. So, imagine wanting to see everything I have to offer and me telling you to go to 40 different places and check out 40 different times. Not to mention that it didn't give my audience autonomy to look around and decide what was best for them once they got to know me and my brand, I needed to give them autonomy to be able to buy the things they needed when they needed it. Centralizing our call to action to the shop meant that our emails were more concise and we had one place to send people.\
\
[00:08:47.050] - Monica\
It opened the door for a whole new marketing strategy that would focus on nurturing our current audience. So, because the first thing, what I'm getting at here, the first thing I learned when I was getting my MBA back in the day, was this it is cheaper to sell to an existing customer than acquire a new customer. And even though I knew this all along, why was I not making it easy for 50,000 plus peo,ple on my email list to see the 100 plus products I had created for them? So to set the stage in March of 2022, I felt a shift in marketing and buying behavior in the online space and particularly with my audience. We all know that the world has been a different place over the last two to three years, and there is a lot of economic concern right now.\
\
[00:09:35.260] - Monica\
Historically, my business operated on a live launch model. This meant that we would have about four cash injections a year. And during the down months when we were not live launching a bigger product, I would have a very tight handle on our expenses to make sure that we were not overspending because we were bringing in less money. With putting all of our energy into live launching, we neglected all the other products that we had created. Plus our live launches were not increasing in terms of money that we were bringing in.\
\
[00:10:03.380] - Monica\
So, I knew something had to change and we needed a new strategy. So, to give an idea of how little of a strategy we had to sell to our ongoing warm audience, look at what the shop did for us in all of 2021. $7,000, just shy of $8,000. Now look what happened when we started putting our focus on the shop in March of 2022. For the first eleven months of 2022, we made over $140,000.\
\
[00:10:31.560] - Monica\
So, clearly, my audience was begging to buy things from me, but I was not giving them a good way to do. So for the remainder of this presentation, I want to walk you through a high level overview of how we've started to utilize our storefront. Basically, the big picture strategy breaks down like this. We have two things that we focus on traffic, how we get people to the shop, and then experience. So with traffic, we use multiple marketing techniques to drive traffic consistently to the shop from our warm audience of people who already know, like and trust us, and for the experience once they're in the shop.\
\
[00:11:07.170] - Monica\
We concentrate on the buying experience once they are there, so we can increase our average order value, which means getting them to add multiple things to their shopping cart. So, this is my philosophy on pricing our digital products in the shop. Digital products are created one time and you can sell them over and over again. They are a leverageable asset, so the price of the individual product is not as important as incentivizing more products to be added to the cart. When we flipped our mentality on pricing, to think about it this way, it changed everything for us.\
\
[00:11:41.790] - Monica\
Our main way of driving people into the shop is with email marketing, and we do this in a variety of different ways. We have weekly flash sales, Friday. Every Friday at 03:00 pm, we have trained our audience to expect a Friday deal. We do new product launches in the shop. We also offer seasonal or themed storewide discounts that layer on top of these deals.\
\
[00:12:02.090] - Monica\
And then we also have welcome and funnel specific one time use coupons. So, we want to train our audience to expect a special deal from us at the same time every week. We came up with this Friday and that's Friday at 03:00 pm. We did not tell people to expect this. We tell people we were going to start doing it.\
\
[00:12:19.240] - Monica\
We just became very consistent with doing it. And now people expect it, and they're always looking forward to what the new deal is going to be. And then we also will layer on discounts from time to time to make that deal even better, like store wide discounts. The offer on something like this, when you're training your audience to expect a really awesome offer from you, it should be a stupid, no brainer offer. Friday and flash sales are a good way to bring a spotlight on products that you haven't talked about in a while or super relevant ones that may be seasonal. So, for example, I have a lot of goal planning type resources.\
\
[00:12:54.780] - Monica\
At the end of the year, those are very appropriate products. Now keep in mind, if I was sending people direct to a sales page and not to the shop, then if I was running a Friday and I wanted you to buy my online goal planning workshop, let's say, and I sent you to a sales page, that's all you could buy for me. So the idea of a Friday is I get you to go to buy the Friday deal, but then all the other marketing triggers in the store will set in and you're going to add more things to your cart. You see the power of this. Okay, so flash sales and new product launches.\
\
[00:13:27.240] - Monica\
So, a flash sale could be on something you already have or it could be on a new product to drum up excitement for the week. We typically run our flash sales from Wednesday to 03:00 pm on Friday, and then it flips out to the Friday. And then also welcome and funnel discounts. Yes, you can actually leverage your sales funnels to then drive people to your online shop. So, once they have come through one of your funnels and you gave them that hyper specific buying journey in that follow up welcome sequence, you can introduce the other things that you have to offer to them.\
\
[00:13:58.920] - Monica\
And one way I like to do that is by giving them a deeper than usual storewide discount. That's a one-time use discount. So, now let's talk about the customer experience. For this, there are a few things we use convert box which will cover what that is, product spotlights, compare at pricing, and announcement bar, and then also order bumps and upsells, also relevant to the shopping experience, not just in sales funnels. So, the first one I want to talk about is convert box.\
\
[00:14:27.930] - Monica\
This displays one time, this specific convert box. We use it for multiple things. We use it for flash sale discounts. Like we just had a big Black Friday deal. So we had a convert box that popped up to let you know about it.\
\
[00:14:40.810] - Monica\
Typically if you are new to our shop, what's going to pop up is this welcome box. Welcome to the shop, give us your name and email and we'll send you a 30% off one time use coupon. That's typically a deeper discount than we would offer at any other time. So, if someone who doesn't know us yet does happen to come to our shop, it's also a way to collect their email address even if they're not ready to buy anything from us.\
\
[00:15:03.810] - Monica\
The other thing we use on our main page there is something called the product spotlight on our theme. So, we are always highlighting whatever the deal is. Once you arrive at our shop on the main page, that's going on. We also use something called compare at pricing. You can see here the original price is $97 and then we mark it down to $47.\
\
[00:15:24.010] - Monica\
So, we show the price savings by using a feature called compare at pricing. On the top of our shop, we have an announcement bar so we can always call attention to what's going on. We typically use the announcement bar mainly to call out when we have a storewide discount going on. Order bumps. We use an app called Honeycomb. And this particular, the way I do order bumps, what happens is when you add something to the cart, and I'll show you this in real time.\
\
[00:15:55.480] - Monica\
When you add something to your shopping cart and you're ready to go shop out or check out, upon going to the checkout page, you're going to be offered a special offer on another product. This is a great way to get multiple products added to a cart. So, I'm just going to go back to my shop and go to check out and show you what happens. Here you go.\
\

So, now I'm offering you a discount, a 30% discount on my CEO business planning spreadsheet. You can add it to your order or skip and continue right on to check out. Now, the other thing we use Honeycomb for is upsells. Now, upsells take place in my shop after the order is placed. So, likeI'm not going to actually place an order in real time.\
\
[00:16:33.230] - Monica\
So, what would happen if I went and proceeded with that order I just showed you? Afterwards, one of these pop-ups would come up, looks similar to the order bump, but it would be a different offer. And usually, I discount my upsells more than my order bumps. There's a whole methodology behind that. But these are just different marketing triggers that we use to get people to add more to their cart and come back to our shop.\
\
[00:16:58.790] - Monica\
Okay, now one of the reasons this has been such a successful strategy for us is because we are extremely organized on the back end. There are a lot of moving parts having a shop, but it really is not that difficult if you are organized. So, just for people who joined the Blogger Breakthrough Summit, I am giving a free copy of our shopify listing template, or a shoplifting template. This is the exact template we use to track all of the information that is relevant to each of our shop listings. Having this information at your fingertips makes listing new products super easy and running strategic marketing campaigns to your email list even easier.\
\
[00:17:35.800] - Monica\
So, you can go on over to empoweredbusiness.co/BBS2023, so Blogger Breakthrough Summit 2023, to get your free listing template now. Also, I put this handy QR code. You might have already seen it throughout the presentation slides and tried to go there already, but you can just hold your phone up to the slide right now and scan that QR code. It's going to take you right there.\
\
[00:17:59.450] - Monica\
It makes it super easy. So, I hope you found this presentation helpful, and I can't wait to see what kind of storefront you will create in the future. I can't wait to hear about it\

**Transcript:**\
[00:00:09.430] - Monique Solomon, www.blogwithmo.com\
Hello there. Hi, everyone, welcome to this Niche selection masterclass brought to you by my new workbook, Nail Your Niche. And today I'm going to share with you my little process of narrowing down your niche, finding the pockets of money so that you can continue to create the content that you love, but actually make some money from it as well. So, we're going to find your profitable niche in today's masterclass.\
\
[00:00:37.510] - Mo\
So, I'm a blog coach. My name is Mo from Blogwithmo.Com, and I actually take bloggers through my process of monetizing a blog. And I want to emphasize my process because there are many ways to monetize your blog, your digital space, you know, your YouTube channel, your Instagram page. There are many ways to skin the cat, as cruel as that sounds. So, I have developed a system that works well for me. I've done it over a few different blogs and different niches. And now I've helped quite a few creators to work through the system and figure out how to profitably, you know, blog, profitably blog and do what you love, but make money from it, because if you ever started a blog before, you know how much work goes into it. And so what I want to do is to ensure that while you're blogging and you're having fun doing that, you're actually making back some money as well, because blogging can get quite expensive as well.\
\
[00:01:35.410] - Mo\
So, let me just share with you a little bit about me. So you're like, OK, who is more? I've never heard about her before. Why is she qualified to tell me anything about selecting a profitable niche?\
\
[00:01:47.260] - Mo\
So, hello again. My name is Mo from Blogwithmo.com. I've said that a few times as well and I will say it a few more times. I'm in Kingston, Jamaica, so if you hear a little bit of an accent, that's where that is from. Born and raised here in the islands. And I a work from home. Mama. Welcome to my bedroom. I'm also a freelance writer. I write content for other businesses who want SEO content for their blogs. I'm a serial blogger. I have developed quite a few blogs now. I started out with a fashion blog highlighting Jamaican fashion many, many years ago, about twelve years to be exact. And then I had a child and so I transitioned into parenting like so many of us do. And then, you know, as we evolve and our hobbies change, my blogs kind of evolved. And so now I have a Kedo blog, I have a blog coaching business. I have a Jamaican travel blog, and I have a personal development blog.\
\
[00:02:44.230] - Mo\
So, I have developed blogs in quite a few niches. So I like to call myself a serial blogger because as I get interested in something else, I feel like I need to document the journey of me getting interested in this something else. But what I've done for myself is to be able to actually make a little bit of money on each of them, at least, so that it's a worthwhile experience for me, because, as I said, it takes a lot to actually create a blog and get people to read it and get people to listen to what you have to say. And so for all that time that I'm putting in, I want to share with you my process of actually making some money without being like sales and pushing stuff down your throat and that kind of thing.\
\
[00:03:25.420] - Mo\
So, in my blog coaching business, I have realized that many people struggle with the niche. And that's because you might occupy a broad category, you know, a space somewhat. But you're like, "Okay, I need to narrow down." You realize the need to narrow down to make some money and to have a focus to know where you're going. And that's where I have developed a cute little system that I want to share with you today. I think it's going to help you out a lot and help you to get that clarity of what next, where do I go with this and how do I make some money? That's all about- I'm all about the money girl.\
\
[00:04:00.790] - Mo\
So, I'm also a Keyword research ninja. What do I mean by that? You know, there are many ways to get traffic to your blog. You can do Pinterest. You can become an Instagram influencer. You can grow a humongous email list. There are many, many ways to get traffic to your blog. I prefer SEO. And so I do have SEO courses and keyword research master classes. I specialize in it because I find, as it says here, I'm a "passive income fiend". I find it's the most passive and also the most targeted traffic. You know, you're really targeting the people who are looking for the exact solution that you have. And so I love that because it's more of a traction marketing. You're attracting people to you instead of you constantly going out and getting new people to come to you every day. Right. Like an Instagram thing you have to post every day Pinterest. You have to post multiple times per day. It's a lot it's too much for me. And as someone with multiple businesses and I work from home. So, now my child is at home in quarantine life. So, I have to be able to make money while still living. I just I don't want to be in front of a computer all day. I don't want. Instagram all day. I mean, if you if you like that, and that's great, however, we all need to be able to make money in this digital space doing what we love. And Instagram is not my jam at all. I think it's something more casual for me. And so I love Keyword research and SEO and finding the things that people are searching for and giving them the content they're looking for, making some money doing that.\
\
[00:05:32.100] - Mo\
So, I'm going to share with you a little bit about all the things niche today. So what is a niche? Let's start with the basics, of course. And niche is a specialized segment of the market. And you see that I have underlined the word specialized because it's not enough to say that you are a parenting blog or you are a vegan blog or you are a health blog. You have to get a little bit more specialized than that. And it's not a category. It's not a broad topic at all. So, within parenting, there are so many ways that you could go. You could be just a pregnancy blogger. You could be a first year as a first step. You could be a food parenting blogger. What to teach, what to give your kids to eat. You could be a blogger into parenting niche for older kids like me, I struggle to find blogs that are talking about kids who are like preteens. And you know where I am at now. They think that by the time you reach this age, you're an expert, apparently, and that in it, if you're a vegan blogger, you still want to drill down a bit more. Are you a low carb vegan blogger or are you a easy meals vegan blogger? So if someone wants to transition to vegan food, you know, these are the meal plans and the recipes that are easy to make. Are you a gourmet vegan blog or do you specialize in holiday recipes?\
\
[00:07:00.960] - Mo\
You know, they're tiny little pockets all out there. And I find the tinier you get is the more profitable the niche is. And so let's get into exactly how specific we want to get with our niche, because parenting is not a niche. Veganism is not a niche. Health blogging, none of them. They're not niche is they're the broad category which are niche sits in. You are going to try and drill down over the course of your whole blogging and your Instagram and all of that. You are going to find it necessary to drill down and actually nail a niche. And so that's what this whole masterclass is about. It's really helping you to drill down and get to the nitty gritty of where your tribe is, where your community is, where your followers are, where your fans are, your readers are, and people who are going to line your pocket because parenting and even blogging is it.\
\
[00:07:56.670] - Mo\
You know, I'm one of my main blogs is in the blogging space and I am a blogger about blogging. But blogging is not a niche. What aspect of blogging do I help people with? Right now? I'm drilling down into niching. And you know why? Because I found out long ago that helping new bloggers is really where the passion for me is, because I was that new blogger many moons ago trying to figure out my space and myself and know that I'm a little bit more seasoned and I've crafted out some systems and some funnels and some strategies for myself. I want to share those things because there is enough food in the pot for everybody to eat. And so I've always believed in not hiding any of these secrets. I strongly believe in helping new bloggers. And so, that's the whole point of my blog, helping other bloggers to figure out how to monetize their digital space and make money. And so even within the blogging sphere, I nailed down, I reached down into helping new bloggers to monetize. Those two are very important for my niche.\
\
[00:09:01.950] - Mo\
I help new bloggers to monetize because not every blogger is actually in it for the money. And so how specific do you want to get? You don't want to drill all the way down. But let's talk a little bit about that specificity. I knew I was going to mess up on that word because your niche is your segment of the market. It's going to be bound by characteristics that are unique. So, when you find that community that you're building, you will realize that you all have a special bond together and it's easier to sell to them when you're all like a sure, we're all vegans, but that's still too broad.\
\
[00:09:39.330] - Mo\
In order to actually make some money, you're going to really want to drill down and find that little specialization, that segment of the market, that there is a common thread. And because you found that common thread and you've become their leader of that common thread, then they start to look to you for the solutions. Because within the common thread of whatever your niche is, there are problems and you will be the one who will lead them. You'll be their facilitator. Your audience will be brought together by a common identity and you will be the one providing solutions to their needs. And I have a very, very unique way to find it. Don't worry about it. We are going to get into the process of actually finding that common thread within your niche. But right now, before we do that, I want you to let me know what you have identified as your niche right now. So put that down in the chat below. Leave some comments. Let me hear what your niche is. If you have pen and paper, which I hope you brought to this session, I want you to jot down your niche right now. It's going to be interesting to see if after we go through the process, your niche changes or you find that you want to go in a different direction. So, let me hear what your niche is and jotted down right now. And before we get into the process, I just want to reach out to you and tell you that we are about to get into the integral part of selecting your niche.\
\
[00:11:00.630] - Mo\
So, I'm going to ask you, please turn off all your distractions, close out the million tabs, put the phone away. I'm about to give you the secret sauce and you're going to want to pay attention, in especially this next few slides. Okay.\
\
[00:11:16.680] - Mo\
So, here is my little I call it my outline, my ultimate guide to my funnel for finding what your niche is. You're going to start with your broad topic. Whatever you wrote down just now, hopefully it fits into the equation. The ultimate guide to X. What was your X? Did you identify a niche? Because one thing I want to say to you is that I realize that many, many bloggers are are occupying a space that is not providing a solution. And one of the reasons why I prefer SEO is because the most profitable blogs out there are the ones that answers questions. They provide solutions. When I type something into Google, it's a problem that I have. It's something that I want to find.\
\
[00:12:04.530] - Mo\
If you are able to give me the answer to that question and you do it well enough that Google actually puts you on page one of the the results, then you have something that we can work with here. We can monetize that. And so we're going to start with fleshing out your niche by starting with the ultimate guide to X. Now, in this example, I'm using homesteading. I don't know anything about homesteading. I'm a city girl at heart.\
\
[00:12:32.580] - Mo\
So, this is how I fleshed out the niche. If I would want to enter a space, the first thing that I'm going to do is I'm going to Google it and I'm going to see what else comes up. And I found a few homesteading books and it helped me to flesh this out. So, of course, in any ultimate guide, you're going to start with what is X? And so I start with what is homesteading? And then I moved, you know, how to get started with homesteading. And then within that, you're going to go into things like building your shelter for your animals, whether it's a barn or, you know, a chicken coop or whatever, and you're going to go into things like disposing of waste water management, raising animals, because if you know nothing about homesteading like I did, it's like having a little farm at home or, well, not at home. You're living in the country. You have a lot of land and you want to raise animals. You want to grow crops because you want to kind of live off grid or semi off grid. You don't want to be to actually have to go to the market every week and buy food. You're doing everything for yourself. And so these are all the topics that would fall under homesteading. And your goal is always to get to the end product. What is the moneymaking post that will be in this niche? And so I can already see a few here.\
\
[00:13:44.220] - Mo\
I see things like tools and resources. If I'm just starting as a homesteader, I might need a few tools. I'm going to need a garden fork and a wheelbarrow and all these things right just off the top of my head. For food preservation, I might need some canning stuff and some, I don't know, for seed storage. Maybe there's a better type of container to store my seeds there. There is just a lot going on. I'm already seeing where this niche can be profitable because I'm seeing some affiliate related posts way down the line somewhere. Right. And so that's just a start of fleshing out or a niche.\
\
[00:14:22.740] - Mo\
Now, how to find your subtopics. If you have no clue, you're going to do what I did and you're going to Google it. But step one really should be you start with your own ideas because you're already in this space. You're already in the niche, maybe in the broad category. And so write down what your own ideas are. Of course, number one is going to be what is or, you know, the benefits of the basics, too. So, that's going to always be sub topic number one. But what else? Write down your own ideas, then Google the rest. You absolutely do not want to skip Googling. I know some people get they get a reservation there because they think that they are going to be tainted by other people's ideas and that's not it at all. You're not copying anybody's ideas. What you want to make sure. Is that your guide is as holistic as possible, you are covering every single topic under the sun, because if someone is out there looking for this key word, that means that Google has determined that anyone who searches for that keyword, these are the topics that they want to see.\
\
[00:15:26.120] - Mo\
So, you don't want to miss the mark. If there are topics out there that other people are writing about and its ranking. And number one, you want to open up those things and see what their subtopics are. Make sure it's somehow aligned with what you've already written down. And if there's anything that you've missed, then you write it down. So, for instance, if I had started with my homesteading niche and I had everything about animals and I had a few things about planting crops, but I didn't have anything about waste management, that would have been a big missed opportunity for me. And so it's not that I'm taking their content. I'm just saying, "Okay, I need to write about waste management as well. And I'm putting it in my ultimate guide outline." So, make sure you you write everything down and then what you want to do is to identify your pillars.\
\
[00:16:11.020] - Mo\
What I mean by your pillars? So within the outline, if you really have a look at that outline, you realize that there are some big humongous topics in there. There are some topics that you are not going to necessarily cover. And that one ultimate guide, you're going to need to break them out and they're going to be their own articles. And that's what I'm referring to when I say Pillar's things like raising animals or disposing of waste. These are huge topics that you can veer off into all kinds of little pockets and talk about for themselves. You know, I've broken it down a little bit here so you can see some other topics that might come under raising animals or disposing of waste. And so these are homesteading pillars, but you can go on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on with breaking out content from your ultimate guide. Because have a look once more at the guide. I want you to realize that each topic, each sub topic on my outline can be its own article. And that is the whole point of writing the ultimate guide. You want to come up with a bank of content that supports each other, that interconnects interlinks. It's showing Google your authority. Every single topic is something that you can break out and write about on its own, because this helps you to build authority in Google's eyes and in your readers eyes. You are going to become the leader. You now know so much about homesteading or whatever your topic is that you have written about it from end to end. And so Google has recognized that, you know what you're talking about. And your audience, they keep coming back for more because your topics are so good and so meaty and you're answering exactly what they're looking for because you've already done your research and realized that people who are searching for the ultimate guide to X, these are all the topics that they want to know information on.\
\
[00:18:07.480] - Mo\
So, you're going to write that ultimate guide post at some point and then you're also going to write about all those subtopics. And over some time, as you start to write all that content, the magic will happen. You will start to see the data pointing you in a different direction. And this, my friends, is the secret sauce to this whole thing, because, remember, homesteading is not a niche. It is a category. It is the broad category that the outline was written. And this is when you're confused, you have no idea where to pivot. But, you know, you want to be in homesteading somewhere. This is not your niche yet, my friends. This is just the category that you're sitting in. But over time, as you're writing these articles, Google and your audience will start to tell you where to pivot. You will realize that you start getting more and more comments about one particular thing. Or when you wrote one blog post, it gets twenty one comments, whereas the others get one or two. Or when you post something to Instagram in support of your blog post, everyone starts to interact with one particular topic more and more and more. On Google side, you realize that certain articles rank much faster than others. You know, these are ranking higher. Every time you write a post about that topic, it ranks more.\
\
[00:19:33.970] - Mo\
So, in your search console when you look at the keywords that people are using to find you, it's all skewed to one particular area of homesteading, that is your niche. Go down that road and follow the money because this now is not you throwing anything on the wall and seeing what sticks. Something has stuck my friends and data is telling you where to go. There is nothing more profitable than research than doing something that data tells you to do. And so if you really want to make money as a blogger, you start by writing all those foundational articles and then listening, watching the data and seeing where it's telling you to go.\
\
[00:20:18.800] - Mo\
So, here's what I want you to do. This is a little secret of mine that I'm sharing with you when you write your ultimate guide outline. Not the post yet. Not the article, not the big thing. You write the outline, you see a few money posts. Didn't we see a few money posts in the outline? Maybe some things about seed storage, maybe some things about the tools and resources that a new homesteader will need; write those first. Yes, Write those posts first identify the posts that are likely to make money and write them first.\
\
[00:20:55.970] - Mo\
Why on earth would I ever tell you to do that? Well, if you know anything about SEO, you know that SEO is a long game. You're not going to write anything today and it ranks tomorrow unless you already have like a super, you know, a super large following a super large blog. You're already established. And girl, this master class is not for you, girl. Share some tips with me. But if you're a new blog or a new content creator and you have your outline, this is why it's so important to always, always, always start with an outline. Whether you're trying to find your niche or whether you're writing one particular article, you always want to start with you outline because you always want to see where the money is.\
\
[00:21:38.120] - Mo\
So, write those posts first. So, yes, if you have a new blog on homesteading, write 10 tools and resources that a new homesteader will need. It doesn't look weird. It doesn't. I hear you. I hear you. Oh, my God. I start with the money post first. I need to introduce the topic. I need to tell them what homesteading is. No, you don't need to tell anybody because as a new blogger, you have a grand total of two point five people reading your blog. So, don't worry about that. We have long gone past days when bloggers, you know, you had an audience and they come in and check your blog every morning to see what new you've posted. That's not what a blog is anymore. And the only thing I used to do that way was back in the day when I used to follow these gossip blogs. And you wanted to see what the latest news is. There is nobody coming to your blog every single morning to see what new you've posted.\
\
[00:22:28.550] - Mo\
Write those money making blog posts, let them sit and age so they will start to rank. The more you read the supporting posts that help them, the more you link to them from your supporting post, the more you start to write those informational posts that's meant to bring to traffic in, the more the the money will start to rock and start to make you money.\
\
[00:22:50.030] - Mo\
Listen, I'm breaking out the Jamaican patois in a few because I get so passionate about this topic, because it works. It works like magic and it makes me passive income as much as as much as that sounds very clich\'e9 right now, money flows for our school. Just- just try let's see what it's going to do because it works. I stand by this. I'm letting you know this is a little secret of mine. If you check any of my blogs, you will see some random moneymaking posts, some of them that do not even have like the supporting articles behind them yet. That's fine. Let them sit out there and age. And once I start to write the supporting pieces behind them, the whole blog just starts to lift all together. I'm starting to make money. I'm starting to get traffic. It just all works. So, synchronously, is that the word? Everything just starts going really, really well. So guys, follow the money, write those posts first and work backwards, because when you have an outline, you can see everything that you're supposed to write. So, write them first and go backwards.\
\
[00:23:55.220] - Mo\
So, takeaway. I want you to write your outline, make sure you write the ultimate guide outline and then identify the money posts and write those first guys. Just trust me on this one, just go with it. And then you write your supporting pieces, all of the other ones that were there. And then you start to pay attention to the data because the outline you have at least twenty articles. So, this is not something that you're- unless you are about to take vacation and just sit down and crank out some content, I don't know twenty articles will take me at least 20 weeks to write because my articles are in depth. They are well, some of them are in depth. They are super. But these articles that you're about to write, it's super important then that you take time to research them properly and write amazing pieces of content, because these are your pillar post. These are where all of your little side business and hustles will come from. These are where all of the little- this is where all the data will come from. This is where all of your audience will be built. It's super important to write these twenty posts for a set of posts very, very well. And then just pay attention to the data. Make sure you install Google search console. Make sure that everything is set up for your analytics to be recording what's working on your blog so that you can start to listen to Google and figure out where that big pivot is.\
\
[00:25:22.440] - Mo\
So, if you need a little bit more help with this concept, I invite you to check out my Nail your Niche workbook. Now, the workbook is like 40 pages long. It goes so much more in-depth into this whole process. It helps you to identify your target audience. There are spaces for you to do your ultimate guide so, you can print it out and write it off. There are exercises there, examples. So, I do the exercises first and then you can have blank pages so you can follow on if you know you needed that extra help, extra explanation on what to do. It goes far in depth and it helps you to really and truly nail your niche, find the money, follow the money and find those are the pockets of profitability within your niche that's kind of untapped. Because that's the beauty of actually doing the outlines, is you're really starting to see that, you know, this is a corner of my niche, I don't see anyone out there exploring this little pocket in depth. And the more you get in depth in those little corners is the more money you make. I tell you, the tiniest niches make the biggest money.\

[00:00:13.430] - Ryan\
Hi, everyone. I'm Ryan from the Podia team. And I'll be walking you through my presentation on how to create a thriving and profitable online community in 2022. So, little background about me first, I am a growth marketer here at Podia. And I've worked with thousands of different creators in all kinds of niche, from bloggers to people selling courses, running their online communities. I've worked with our affiliates. I run our weekly demos along with new product demos, and I'm always talking to our creators.\
\
[00:00:49.490] - Ryan\
I love to do customer interviews and see what are the hot topics. And that's how I've learned that community is one of the most important pieces of your online business coming into next year. So, I'm really excited to share what I know about community and how you can apply it to your own business. Just one thing before we jump in, I will ask you to close those other browser tabs. Put your phone on mute.\
\
[00:01:12.830] - Ryan\
It's only going to be maybe 30 minutes. So, if you can just give me your undivided attention for that, it will really help you grow your own online community. So, I want to just give a brief overview of the types of things you're going to learn today. So, first, I want to talk about how you as a creator can attract people into your community. The first thing we need to do is give you some tips on how you can start building your online community.\
\
[00:01:37.930] - Ryan\
Maybe you have a little Facebook group, or maybe you've never even thought about that, you're just focused on blogging. But what we want to do is give you some just beginner tips that you can use to begin growing your online community today. Next, once you begin growing your community, the next big challenge creators face is keeping people in the community. You got to keep it active.\
\
[00:01:58.630] - Ryan\
You got to keep it engaged. You got to keep people wanting to come back for more. So, I'll be giving you some tips on how much you get people in your community. You can keep them there. And finally, the best part of any community is engaging with your audience but also making some extra money from it.\
\
[00:02:14.620] - Ryan\
And what's really good about an online community is once it gets running, then it's almost on autopilot. You can just keep it going. But you can start charging either to make that monthly recurring revenue to maintain access to your community, or is a perfect pipeline to start selling your own products directly into your community. So, with that being said, I hope everyone is as excited as I am. So, let's jump in.\
\
[00:02:38.440] - Ryan\
So, the first most important part of building any new community is picking the right niche for your community. Now, this isn't to say that you want to get hyper niche focused. A lot of people, now, when they're building websites or something, so, you want to be as niche as possible.\
\
[00:02:55.310] - Ryan\
That doesn't really apply to the community model. You want something that does have some broader appeal that will bring in the type of audience member you want, but you don't want it too broad. You don't want it too narrow. So I call it the Goldilocks rule. Not too hard, not too soft, but you want it just right.\
\
[00:03:13.910] - Ryan\
So think of your niche, what you're blogging about. So, if you are a travel blogger, maybe you don't want just a travel community that's too broad. But you don't also just want a Los Angeles community that's too narrow. You want something in the middle that really speaks to your audience and what you're trying to generate. So, if you're a women's travel blogger, running a women's travel group would be perfect.\
\
[00:03:38.350] - Ryan\
Maybe you're a chef and you teach people about cooking. Just a cooking community again, too broad. But if it's how to use one specific type of knife, that's probably too specific, something between maybe budget cooking, something that will appeal or growing your own food, something that is in your broader niche, but also a little more targeted to get that right person in there. So, think of your niche, apply it to what makes sense for you and try to find something maybe a bit broader, but right in that middle ground to attract more people into your community in the first place.\
\
[00:04:14.610] - Ryan\
Once you identify that niche, you really want to come up with a hook to get people into your community by offering them some exclusive benefits.\
\
[00:04:22.870] - Ryan\
So you're probably familiar with the idea of lead magnets to get people on your email list, maybe offering a freebie or something like that to get people to sign up. It's the same idea when growing your community, you really want to offer some exclusive benefit to give people that push to sign up to get them in there. Once they're in there, hopefully, they'll stay by seeing the value. But you do need that hook to get people in. So some ideas that you can use as that hook to get people into your community, you can offer a digital download.\
\
[00:04:52.900] - Ryan\
These can be really easy to set up, and you can even leverage your existing lead magnet. So, if you're using things to get people on your email list, you can just repurpose that and put that in your community as an incentive for people to sign up there. You can offer, if you have an old course, you can put that course in there, maybe a webinar that you've done, maybe a webinar you're going to do or product discount. You can say once you sign up to my community, I'll give you an exclusive community member 10% discount code.\
\
[00:05:22.010] - Ryan\
Whatever it is, think about what you're probably already offering your audience to get them to sign up to a place like your email list and just repackage that, make that an inclusive benefit in your community. And then you can easily add that. And people can download or access whatever that benefit is when they sign up. And finally, once you've identified your niche, you've come up with a great sort of opt in incentive. Then you need to promote your community and tell people about it.\
\
[00:05:47.960] - Ryan\
So, again, this isn't going to be wildly different than anything you're currently doing. So, put it on your blog, have it in your sidebar, make it prominent, include it in your email list. What I would do is, when you're first announcing it, I would have a little build up, say something's coming, then have a dedicated email announcing the community and then going forward in the footer of every email you send, I would have a little blurb just about you. And oh, have you joined my free community and get access to whatever that opt in benefit is?\
\
[00:06:19.490] - Ryan\
So, make it part of your ongoing marketing strategy.\
\
[00:06:22.620] - Ryan\
Put on your social media. Again, leverage those incentives and put them in there. And then also one other tactic that I really like to use. It's not for everyone, but it does tie into the monetization piece later is you can tease it as say, oh, right now I'm growing my community. It's free, but one day I might charge. But if you're in there, you'll be able to keep free access or say, oh, it's free, but only for the first 1000 members or whatever number you decide.\
\
[00:06:49.000] - Ryan\
That can be a great way to leverage your existing audience. Get them excited to sign up and start building those numbers. Because once that momentum begins to build, then we can start focusing on some of the other important pieces. So, one question I'd like to put to you right now is, what niche makes sense for your community. Remember, you want something that's broadly related to your niche, but not too broad.\
\
[00:07:11.080] - Ryan\
So, think of something in that range. Maybe look at your blog, what you're talking about and find that kind of broader category related to your niche. That makes sense that people will want to chat about and really will bring in the right type of audience for you. So, the next thing you do is after you start building that community, people are coming in for you. You're building that excitement, you're getting them in there.\
\
[00:07:34.850] - Ryan\
Now you need to engage them. You really want to keep them in there. And so, we don't want this to be a very manual process on you. People will join the community for you and the benefits you're offering them as a creator. But they'll stay for the engagement and the conversations they're having with each other.\
\
[00:07:52.000] - Ryan\
So, we really need to find a way to make that long term community active and engaged. So, really, I've identified three key pieces to a great community and that's activity, organization and connections. So, I'm going to dive into each of those next. First, as everyone knows, the most important part of any community is activity. If you join a community, and there's no post for a month.\
\
[00:08:17.820] - Ryan\
You're going to forget about it. You're going to leave. You're not going to care. You need that activity regularly going to keep people excited and engaged and looking forward to going and engaging in your community. So, as you're growing your community in the very beginning, it's going to be on you to spark this engagement, to get those conversations going.\
\
[00:08:37.700] - Ryan\
So what I would recommend, I would make a weekly plan of things that you're going to do in your community to spark that conversation. You don't want this to be just like your blog where you're the one posting people are consuming. You want to get people engaged, you want to get them talking. So, some ideas. And again, this depends on your niche and what works best for you.\
\
[00:08:57.370] - Ryan\
But some things that I've seen work really well in our creator communities are sharing relevant industry news. That's something you can go. Just find two or three blog posts around the internet or on your own site and post them. And maybe something that's a little controversial. Maybe something that people haven't thought about, just anything that can kind of get that conversation going is great.\
\
[00:09:17.980] - Ryan\
You can also pose a question of the week, so you can just come up with a relevant question, maybe something you came across or something you got emailed from someone in your audience again, just get that conversation going, provide your feedback. But also give a place for your audience to share their thoughts and their feedback as well. You can also allow member promotion days. So, a tricky balance with communities is you don't want people joining and just like spamming links to their own websites and promoting their optin freebies.\
\
[00:09:47.810] - Ryan\
Then it becomes a mess.\
\
[00:09:48.920] - Ryan\
But your members really do like to do that. And in the smaller engaged communities, they really do like to support each other. So, to find a happy middle ground, I recommend having member promotion days. So, you might say, hey, there's no self promotion allowed, except on Fridays. And then on Fridays, you can post your latest blog posts.\
\
[00:10:07.710] - Ryan\
You can see what other people in the community have been working on. That can be a really good way to have people engaged because they know, oh. Every Friday, I can go in, I can share my posts, maybe get some comments, maybe I can highlight that new Instagram post. I just did whatever it is you want to give your audience a place where they feel like it's okay for them to promote themselves, but they shouldn't be doing it all the time. So that's a really good balance that I found is identifying one member promotion day. And also just keep adding exclusive content to your community.\
\
[00:10:40.030] - Ryan\
Whether that is running just a once a month webinar, you'll get in and you'll teach something for 30 minutes.\
\
[00:10:45.540] - Ryan\
It doesn't need to be long or a new digital download template or early access to your new course. Whatever it is, just try to think of ways to make your community members feel like they're your VIPs. They're there, they're engaged. So, treat them right and give them some exclusive access, which will lead to higher activity and engagement. The next big thing with any community is you've got to keep it organized as your community grows.\
\
[00:11:12.720] - Ryan\
And if you're following these tips, hopefully you'll see it grow from the dozens to the hundreds to the thousands. But what happens when you have so many people is conversations can get buried, especially if people are talking about different topics, and then there's replies and it can just become a mess. So, I highly recommend keeping your community organized from the beginning. This might seem like overkill, especially if you don't have a community yet or you're just starting to grow it. But if you can lay the groundwork early for a nice organized community, it'll really pay the dividends later.\
\
[00:11:47.800] - Ryan\
So, to do this, I recommend coming up with maybe five to ten non overlapping topics related to your general community. So, for example, if our general community is budget cooking, you might have one topic that's recipes. So, any conversation about recipes goes on that topic. You might have one conversation about your favorite other bloggers. You might have a conversation about cooking tips like whatever it is, you want to find different ways that you can break down the community into digestible topics.\
\
[00:12:23.430] - Ryan\
That way people can go and they can say, oh, I'm just interested in looking at the new recipes. Let me go to that recipes topic, or oh, I really want to buy a kitchen knife, but I don't know which one to get. Then you can go into the cooking equipment topic or whatever you decide. So, it's worth spending a little bit of time to map out your community. And you don't want those topics to overlap because you want to know if I'm going to recipes, I'll find the recipes or if I'm going to cooking equipment, I'll find that.\
\
[00:12:50.760] - Ryan\
So, try to think of five to ten logical, non overlapping topics related to your broader niche that you can subdivide the community into. And this will just make it so much easier to manage later on as your community grows. Finally, the main thing that's going to keep people in your community is their connections with you, but also with each other. So, you really want to start to organically grow your community members chatting with each other. So, just a couple of ways you can do this is when someone joins, you can just ask new members to create an introduction post. And maybe that's weekly or every day, whatever it is, ask your new members, welcome them, and then have them share.\
\
[00:13:34.330] - Ryan\
Maybe just a couple of basic things, but also something fun about themselves that can start a conversation. So, maybe where are you from? What's your name and what's one thing that most people wouldn't know about you. Whatever it is, you just want them to feel like they're growing part of your real community. And so, sharing something personal that can get some fun stories going get other members to welcome them.\
\
[00:13:56.200] - Ryan\
You really want to build that connection with the other community members, so people feel really involved and that they want to stay. Another great way to do this is each week you can send out either an email recap or in your community itself, highlighting some of the interesting conversations that have happened. So, you can say, oh, Rachel posted this thread about her favorite cooking knives, or Jim posted this one about his itinerary to Australia. Whatever it is, you just want to highlight some good conversations, especially if they got good engagement with each other because more members will want to contribute and then they will hopefully get featured the next week.\
\
[00:14:34.570] - Ryan\
So, it really builds on itself, gives you a reason to email your list or post about it at the top of the community.\
\
[00:14:40.630] - Ryan\
That way people feel involved, they feel seen and they really feel like they're part of something. One other idea that I've seen work, well, in some communities is randomly matching community members with each other for a 30 minutes Zoom call or just to connect one on one over chat. Whatever it is, it just really builds this way of people getting to know each other. You don't necessarily want to force people into it, but if people optionally want to join a topic, it can be called buddies or connections.\
\
[00:15:08.730] - Ryan\
You can have a topic, and then if people are in there, you know, they're hoping to meet other people.\
\
[00:15:13.490] - Ryan\
So then once a week or once a month, whatever you decide, you can randomly match members together and then they can have their own conversations. And again, that's organically building those connections without you being directly involved. Do you want to be the one who's kind of overseeing things, keeping people on track? But you really want to start building those one to one connections among your community members. You don't want to completely rely on you.\
\
[00:15:39.080] - Ryan\
You want them to feel connected to each other. That's what will get that engagement. That's what will get people to stay. So, another question to pose is how would you divide your community into, say, five to ten non overlapping topics? So, just give a thought to your niche, your Goldilocks niche for your community.\
\
[00:15:58.580] - Ryan\
How can you divide that into maybe five to ten topics? You don't have to do this right now, but just spend some time over the next couple of days and map out five to ten topics that you think could work really well for your community to keep it organized. So, we've now attracted people in our community. We're growing it and engagements going up. We're keeping people there.\
\
[00:16:20.110] - Ryan\
They're excited. How can we now make money from this? You don't want to just be running it as a time intensive thing that's not really benefiting your business. So, the third step is monetizing your community, and we've seen with our creators that a community is one of the most valuable business assets you can have. Because a, you own it. This is your community and the people look up to you.\
\
[00:16:44.880] - Ryan\
So, when you get going, it gives you a lot of marketing power and the ability to sell your audience because this is probably your most valuable audience. Your email list is obviously important, but in the community, people will feel even more connected to you because they're engaging with you much more regularly. So, let's look at a couple of different ways you Canva monetize your community. So, the first way to find new product ideas or content to create is to look for common challenges that your community members are posting about.\
\
[00:17:16.690] - Ryan\
You don't need to go and try to brainstorm, oh, should I write this blog post, or should I create this online course or this digital download?\
\
[00:17:24.530] - Ryan\
Your community will do the work for you. As your community grows, you're going to start to see the same questions being asked over and over, whether it's on a certain topic or how to do one certain thing or whatever it is, you're going to start to see a pattern of members in your community asking the same questions. This should be a big flashing red light to you that that is a challenge common in your niche that you should go solve. So, whatever it is, you want to go and say, oh, I've seen the same question over and over.\
\
[00:17:58.700] - Ryan\
That's something that both people in my community are struggling with, which means people outside of my community are struggling with, too.\
\
[00:18:05.220] - Ryan\
So, you want to identify those common problems and go and create the solution that can be a blog post that can be a digital product that you sell. Whatever it is, it can be a webinar, whatever it is, you want to create the solutions to the problems that you're seeing. And then you'll be able to sell those and make some extra money. So, I just mentioned the digital products. So, once you identify those challenges that you're seeing over and over, you want to go create digital products around that, and these can range wildly in price.\
\
[00:18:36.470] - Ryan\
So, on the cheaper end, a lot of times people will say, oh, I don't know how to outline a blog post or I don't know how to plan a trip.\
\
[00:18:45.070] - Ryan\
I just don't know what to pack. Whatever it is, you can go either on the cheaper and typically the cheaper products that you can sell are also the faster ones to create. So, I've listed a couple of examples here, but kind of on the cheaper and easier to create. Those would be your templates or your ebooks, so it could just be a $10 downloadable PDF that is, here's your perfect packing guide, or here's the best kitchen knives for 2022. Whatever it is, look at the challenges that your community members are facing and make a quick digestible digital download or a template that they can use to answer that.\
\
[00:19:24.210] - Ryan\
As you get into more complicated questions, you might want to think about creating an online course around it. An online course doesn't need to be some massive 200 video, 20 hours thing. It can be a one to two hour video course. That's completely fine. So, if there's something a little more complicated that you can't solve with the template or an ebook, now you can just make an online course.\
\
[00:19:45.950] - Ryan\
You can easily film things, record your slides, however you want, and you can sell that course. And those courses tend to command a higher price than a lot of the cheaper downloadable templates and ebooks. So ,by making that course, you can sell a $97 course in 1 hour that will solve whatever that challenge that you're seeing, your community is. And from there, if you really want to take it up, you can start offering coaching or mastermind session. So, these are your high ticket offers kind of on the other end of the spectrum for people that want that one to one attention with you or want to be part of a monthly coaching group.\
\
[00:20:22.740] - Ryan\
That's where you work in your group coaching program. So, you have a wide range of things to pick. But I would recommend starting with maybe the cheaper options, the templates, the ebooks, the digital downloads, see how those do see people are buying them. And if they are, then you can progress to a course, and finally, to a coaching or a mastermind program. The other way that I really love to have creators monetize communities is by offering an ongoing subscription plan.\
\
[00:20:50.160] - Ryan\
So, I said at the beginning you might want to offer community access for free, but one day you might want to turn that paid. So, one of the best things you can do is run a paid community. So, people instead of just joining and engaging and chatting for free, eventually you want those people to pay, so they might pay even if it's only five or $10 a month. If you get your community to 100 people or 1000 people. If you're charging even $5 a month for 1000 person community, that's an extra $5,000 a month in your pocket without really any extra work.\
\
[00:21:22.970] - Ryan\
And actually, this is just a very valuable audience for the rest of your business. So, charging subscription plans is really a powerful way. And again, I love to grow communities by first offering them free, but hinting that this might go paid one day. So, you probably want to get grandfathered in now while it's free, and then if it goes paid, then you'll benefit from that. Or another thing that we've seen work really well here at Podia is you can offer different tiers of membership plans. So, you can keep a free one or you can offer, say, a $10 month plan that includes access to a private topic just for members, or that can go all the way up.\
\
[00:22:02.530] - Ryan\
You can offer $200 a month plans that include live group coaching and webinars, or you can offer a $50 a month plan that includes access to some of your digital products in your courses.\
\
[00:22:13.980] - Ryan\
It's completely up to you, but having that flexibility to set different tiers of membership plans is a great way to grow your business and give you that consistent monthly revenue without you having to constantly turn out new products. You just got to keep your community active and engaged. And if you followed these tips, you'll have an active and engaged community that people will happily pay 5 or $10 a month at the beginning just to stay a part of. So, getting those monthly subscription plans into your community is one of the best ways you can monetize, and it ties together with everything that you're already creating.\
\
[00:22:49.890] - Ryan\
So, I've thrown a lot of information to you on how you can get started with growing your community, keeping it active and then monetizing it. So, let me break it down real quick into some of these action steps. So, first, I want you to go away and picture Goldilocks topic related to your general niche, which is not too broad but not too narrow. So, find something in the middle, something that is maybe like budget travel or budget cooking or jazz music. Something that relates to the bigger topic makes it a little more specific, but not too narrow.\
\
[00:23:23.370] - Ryan\
So, once you've done that, brainstorm some of your content that you can use as an absence to join. And again, no need to reinvent the wheel here. You can use your existing lead magnets that you're using for your email list or for other purposes. You can use that and say, when you sign up to my community, you'll get this free bonus, whatever it is. Then map out your weekly content plan.\
\
[00:23:45.710] - Ryan\
Whether that's various industry news you're going to post, questions you're going to ask, things you're going to highlight, whatever it is. It makes it a lot easier if you follow a consistent format each week makes it predictable for you and your audience. That on certain days certain things will happen whether that's a question or a member share day, whatever it is. Just map out your schedule and then it'll be very easy to follow going forward. Next, divide your community into those five to ten non overlapping topics.\
\
[00:24:14.970] - Ryan\
This might not seem something really important now, but as your community grows, it will be so beneficial having things nice and organized from the get go. It'll keep it tidy. Conversations won't get buried, which in turn will increase engagement. So, having those topics identified really will help you grow your community. As your community grows, I want you to keep a list of common questions you're seeing asked in your community. This is a goldmine of information for you.\
\
[00:24:42.710] - Ryan\
As a creator, it'll tell you what blog posts you should go create what digital products you should make? How you can monetize is by solving these challenges, and your audience will be telling you almost every day what they're struggling with. So, that is just such valuable information for you. As a creator, you can go solve those challenges with your products with your blog posts, and then you'll benefit from that.\
\
[00:25:06.880] - Ryan\
And eventually, the long goal here is you want to turn your community into those paid monthly subscriptions. You can sell your one off products, of course, but I love seeing creators get that consistent monthly revenue from running their community. It builds that audience builds a relationship, and you don't need to charge a lot. You can charge 5 to $10 a month just to keep access to your community. And you're getting this great, warm audience of people who really like you like your content, and then they're going to be more likely to buy your higher price products if you decide to sell them in the future.\
\
[00:25:39.040] - Ryan\
So, those are my action steps. It's a lot of information, but you can pause the video here, write these down. You can go through the slides and just really map it out. So, the next logical question a lot of people ask us. Okay, Ryan, this sounds great.\
\
[00:25:52.310] - Ryan\
How do I choose a community platform? So, there's a few key things that I want you to think about when you're deciding where to run your online community. First, I keep talking about these monthly subscription plans. You really want a platform that allows you to easily set and run monthly subscription plans, especially something with different tiers. You might want a free plan and keep that forever. That's fine.\
\
[00:26:15.900] - Ryan\
But then you might want a 5 to $10 a month or $50 a month or $100 a month. You want that option to offer different levels of plans, because that means it can grow as your community grows, and you can make more money. Similar to that is you need the ability to take payments for your products that includes both your one off digital products. If you do want to sell those ebooks or the templates, or an online course, or all the way up to easily charging monthly for your community. You don't want to be mainly trying to keep track of PayPal how this goes there, and I need to send this.\
\
[00:26:51.480] - Ryan\
You want a platform that can manage that for you.\
\
[00:26:54.290] - Ryan\
Also related to all this is, it's essential that you have a platform where you can run your community and sell those products in the same place. You don't want people logging into one platform, then you're selling a product and they have to go somewhere else to access it, and then they have to go back to chat about it. It's so much smoother and easier if you can run your community and sell your products all in one place. And finally, you want to own your audience.\
\
[00:27:19.250] - Ryan\
You don't want them hidden behind some algorithm and not have access to their email address. You want to be able to email your customers, get in front of them when you want to. So, probably see where I'm going with this. But Facebook groups fail all four of these. You can't easily do monthly subscriptions. You can't easily take payments for your products.\
\
[00:27:40.580] - Ryan\
You definitely can't run your community and sell your products in the same place, and you don't own your audience. Facebook is notorious for hiding audience information. You don't get their email address automatically. So, my solution, of course, is Podia. We talk to creators, and we've heard over and over those four key criteria in a community platform. And we weren't really able to find one that sold all four of those in one place.\
\
[00:28:07.450] - Ryan\
So, we built it. With Podia, you can have your online community all in one place, you have the organized topics you've got the chat. But also we're a digital product platform so you can sell unlimited courses and digital downloads all for one price. You can set different membership tiers and we don't charge transaction fees. So, it really has been built from the ground up to be the perfect community platform for creators for one monthly fee, starting at just $39 a month.\
\
[00:28:39.050] - Ryan\
You can have access to a community and sell unlimited digital products. So, if you just want to test your digital downloads alongside your community, go for it. We offer a 14 day free trial at Podia.com. You don't need a code or anything.\
\
[00:28:53.740] - Ryan\
You can just go to Podia.com. You can click this button that should be popping up right about now, and that will take you to the Podia.Com website and sign up for a free trial. And you don't have to use Podia. There's other platforms out there, too. But I personally know that after talking to creators, we really wanted to build something that solves all those issues and helps you run a profitable community.\
\
[00:29:16.540] - Ryan\
So, we would love to show you Podia. But if it's not Podia, I still highly recommend finding a platform where you can run your community in the same place that you sell your digital products and grow that community. So, any questions? Please put them in the chat box below. Thanks so much.\

[00:00:03.650] - Sandra De Freitas\
Welcome, everyone. Thank you for attending the Bloggers' Breakthrough Summit. My name is Sandra De Freitas, and today I'm going to go through how you, bloggers, can turn your expertise into membership sites. So what if you could have predictable revenue every single month without relying on ads, the algorithm changes, or sponsorships? What if I told you every month at the top of the month, you had $2,000 coming in, $5,000 coming in, $10,000 coming in? Would that be something that would have your attention? Would that be something that you would want ongoing? I'm going to say yes. My name is Sandra De Freitas. I've been an online entrepreneur for over 20 years. Since 2005, I've built, launched, managed, promoted, consulted on memberships. I did from the tech, to the behind the scenes, to in front of the scenes, for myself and for clients. I've been behind multiple six and seven-figure launches. I'm the creator of Engaged and Profitable Memberships. I am the host of memberships, launches, and Communities, the podcast and the group, and I'm the creator of Burnout Free Memberships. Something that I love to talk about is how to create a membership without that burnout feeling, without even getting close to burnout.\
\
[00:01:26.150] - Sandra De Freitas\
I'm also the host of a summit called Memberships: What's Working Now. I have created three memberships of my own, and another one I'm going to launch very soon. One is called Engaged Groups Membership. It's a membership that I use to help people launch, grow, manage, monetize, and engage their Facebook groups. It has been going strong since May of 2019. If you want to find out that information, you can go to my website, Engaged Groups, and there's an Everything tab, and you'll be able to take a look at that. Then we also have another one that I launched in 2024 called Engagement of Profitable Memberships. Here's where I help entrepreneurs with their memberships so that they don't burn out. They will have the content they need, all the resources they need, email templates, sales page templates, step by step spreadsheets to keep them organized. Everything that I use is in here. And then I also have a higher level membership called Emerald Elite. In here, I offer more customized help through not only a Facebook community, but also two group calls a month. And there's a VIP option where I offer support through voxer. Now, I am known for strategically planning launches, helping membership owners avoid burnout, making Memberships Sustainable, helping people create memberships with the content they already have.\
\
[00:02:50.900] - Sandra De Freitas\
And I have been told I'm the launch mom, and my clients also call me the Membership Fairie Godmother. I have been creating, love creating customized to to-do list for clients. So people tell me, What do I need to do next? And I'm like, Here's the next three things, the next five things. Go do them, come back and let me know when they're done. And then we just keep going. And I love doing that. And I wish someone would do that for me in my business. I encourage my clients to obtain recurring, reliable revenue month after month, year after year, because you never know what the economy is going to be like, and you never know how you're going to feel. So for some people, they have all the energy in the world, and they can continuously launch and get new sponsorships or get new brand ambassador stuff. But not everyone can do that. Not everyone has the energy for it. And sometimes when either you get sick or someone you love gets sick and you want to help take care of them, you need this predictable income month after month. I also love to make people laugh.\
\
[00:03:48.190] - Sandra De Freitas\
So let's get back to you. Have you ever wondered how to monetize your expertise as a blogger? Memberships are a very powerful revenue-generating tool. What if you could add another five figures to your annual revenue? What if I said to you, I can give you a membership idea and you can generate $10,000 more in the year or $10,000 more in the month? What if you didn't have to rely on display ads for your revenue? I know that things shift sometimes with how those ads are doing. And so what if you just had this predictability from a membership? What if you didn't have to hope for a sponsorship or influencer or brand ambassador opportunities? So with memberships, you have predictable money month after month. And once you sell it, once you will have this recurring revenue ongoing. You always have something to sell. And I love this. I love this for bloggers, especially. You have a lot of traffic coming into your site all the time. So why not use that to your advantage and have this membership where... Or have this membership where people can join anytime. And after reading a blog post or after reading a couple of blog posts, they're like, yes, I want more.\
\
[00:05:01.870] - Sandra De Freitas\
I want the detail. I want the DIY. I want everything from this. You also can provide a community for them that is different from the community that's just on your blog. So you could do a Facebook group, a Voxer group, a Slack group. I mean, there's so many options out there. What I love about this is you can have deeper connections with them, and they can have deeper connections with each other. It increases your credibility because now you're not just like... You're not just like a faceless blog. You are a human, and they have this credibility in your name just means more to them. Then if someone else, they could go to their membership and they have this relationship with them, if you didn't have a membership, they would have more of a, I don't want to say 2D relationship, but let's just say a 2D relationship as opposed to a 3D relationship. Your members can get together on Zoom, or they can watch a Facebook Live about you or your Facebook Live, or they can join you a Zoom. It doesn't have to be anything like what you're teaching. It could be something very fun and creative, like a holiday party or a spa night or a bring your favorite beverage night.\
\
[00:06:09.830] - Sandra De Freitas\
It increases trust and it's fantastic for research. If you're wondering What is the next blog that I need to put out there? What are the things that everyone wants to know about and need? It's one thing to ask them. It's another thing to experience it in your membership where they're going to be asking, How do I find this? How do I get this? How do I do A? How do I do B? Can you teach me how you do C? They will be telling you the content that they want, not only for the membership, but the content that they want to see in your blog. This is incredible research. And because they're closer to you, they will want to answer you. They will want to be helping you as well. They're going to want to see you succeed. So you will be providing exclusive content in the membership and providing more personalized experience. Now, when I say personalized, I don't mean you're providing an experience for every single person in your membership, but you're providing an experience for the whole group of the people in your membership. Let's identify your target audience. You probably already know this with your blog, but I want you to figure out what are your unique skills and what are you known for?\
\
[00:07:18.730] - Sandra De Freitas\
What are you known for? When people are asking you for help or your opinion, what are they asking you for? So my first coach, when I was trying to figure out what business was going to be, he had me email everyone I knew, friends, colleagues, neighbors, family, and say, If you were to pay me to solve a problem, what would that problem be? I had a variety of answers. Now, this goes back a long time ago, so none of those answers are even relevant right now because a lot has changed. But that gave me a jumping off point to know exactly where my business needs to go. So think about what people ask you about on your blog. What are the comments asking you for? What is your blog about and what are people asking about in the comments? In the comments, people might be asking something more specific, whether they're asking them in the blog comments or your social media comments, but they're asking for something a little bit more specific. Think about that and we could Use that to help build your membership. Market research to identify your target audience. Now, a target audience is specific.\
\
[00:08:21.320] - Sandra De Freitas\
It is not just women. We want to know who are these people? One of the things that you could identify with is who do you love working with the most. I mean, I love working with people who have a sense of humor. I can't just say that in my ads. I can't just whatever. But I know that if I bring out my sense of humor, they're going to be more attracted to that and they're going to be coming in. I know I need to elevate that in my life, bringing those fun people. But who do you love working with outside of that? Do you love working with corporate women or work-at-home moms or millennials? Who are those people? What do they need? And really, who do you identify with the most? And something I would like to look at is like... Let me go back one. Who were you before? Before you became who you are now, before you became this expert in this subject matter. Who were you before? Where were you struggling? What were you needing? What did you hope was out there that wasn't out there? And is that your membership? What did you hope was out there to help you?\
\
[00:09:27.110] - Sandra De Freitas\
What could it help you? Fast forward your success, but it wasn't out there. And so you can create that membership for those people. Now, you know your audience and who they're made up of. But I want you to look back like when you weren't a successful blogger, when you weren't this social media or this blogging expert, this subject matter spirit. How would you identify yourself? And these are a couple of things you can look at. What were the problems you were facing? What were your interests? What were your demographics? What was your age? So I have a client who teaches people how to dress. And this is not like she teaches them how to dress. Fashionably dress. And it's not necessarily on just really, really expensive, fashionable brands. She will look at many other brands and she will bring things to people so that they can not only, when they're looking at their wardrobe, they're finding products that work in many different ways. They're very versatile, very sustainable. And so she does this for people. She started blogging just on fashion, and now she has a membership where she's helping people pick up their wardrobes one season at a time.\
\
[00:10:36.530] - Sandra De Freitas\
One of the things she does is, I'm going to go into this a little later, but one of the things she does is she creates this like guide, the seasonal guide. And so the seasonal guide is almost... Picture like a magazine. And then she links over to all the stores where they can get those things. So she makes it super easy. What do I love about that? It saves them time, money, energy, and brain power. We're going to go to that in a second. So a niche is important because it helps your membership stand out. It attracts the dedicated members, and it builds a community that feels unique and exclusive, which also increases your loyalty, your engagement, and the value for everyone. So let's go into a membership model for bloggers. This is what I identify as being the best one for bloggers. There are other models, like an audio-only model or an audit model, where you're doing audits all the time. They may not be suitable for what you do. I mean, if you loved audio, you wouldn't be blogging, you would be doing audio, but you like typing and writing better. Yes, I could be wrong.\
\
[00:11:45.430] - Sandra De Freitas\
Let me know. But with a publisher model, it's actually a pretty easy model to put out there. So you typically deliver four pieces of content a month. I wouldn't do less than three, and I wouldn't do more than four. So I like to say I like to schedule out content for my publisher model memberships as once a week. So every Tuesday, things will go out. Now, some months have multiple Tuesdays, have five Tuesdays in the month. We just don't do anything for that last Tuesday. So think of four pieces that you can put out every month. One is released each week and it's the same deliverables each month. So if you're doing, like my client, well, she does a guide every quarter, but every month there is a Q&A, and every month there's a call with an expert. It's not like some months there's Q&A's and some months there's calls with experts. The members know to expect the same type of deliverable every single month. For example, you might have a training video, you might have a template, could be as simple as a Google Doc, you can have step-by-step instructions, easy for you to say, like a PDF, a video, or a checklist.\
\
[00:12:57.550] - Sandra De Freitas\
A Q&A is a really easy one to do. You don't even need to prepare. You could have people submit questions ahead of time, whether in a post in your community or a form that they fill out. This is especially good if you don't want to do your Q&A live, you could ask people for questions, record it, and then post it into your membership. So what to offer in your publisher membership. So I want you to ask yourself, what questions are you being asked over and over again? What are people wanting and needing from you that are above and beyond your blog? How can you shortcut people's success? So when they're looking at what you're creating and what you're doing for them, how can you shortcut their success? So for my client, she, instead of telling them what they need is black pants and beige pants and maybe a black and beige purse, she actually goes out and she finds those items and links to them so they don't have to spend their time researching and looking for the in style of those black pants, those beige pants and that black and beige purse. She gets it to them really quickly.\
\
[00:14:08.620] - Sandra De Freitas\
Okay. Can you save people time, money, energy, or brainpower? This is the key to a successful membership. If in the sales page of your membership, you say that by using your strategies, you can save them three hours of time a month. Amazing. If If you say, I'm going to... My client saves them time by trying to figure out what to wear all the time. She actually puts together outfits and shows them exactly how. So it's less time, less things that they have to think about. If you can save them money. In my Engaged Groups membership, I offer at least 12 posts, so captions and images that they could use in their Facebook group to keep engagement going. That is saving them time. If they try to figure out and put together these posts every month, It would probably take them... It takes me about an hour to come up with the content, and then I have someone creating the images for me, and that's another hour or two. So I'm saving them three hours a month. I'm also saving them the brainpower from figuring it out what to put. And you know what? If they didn't have those, it's likely they wouldn't even put engaging posts in their Facebook groups.\
\
[00:15:22.570] - Sandra De Freitas\
Isn't that interesting? They probably wouldn't even put engaging posts in their Facebook group because it would get to the point where they're like, I don't feel like doing this. I don't know what to put. I don't want to spend three hours on this. So it actually saves them the time, the brainpower. And they're also saving the money. So if they were going to hire someone to do this for them every single month, that would be money that they would have to spend. Does it Saving them energy? Absolutely. It saves them from trying to even think or not even putting that on their to-do list is a great thing. Look at your subject matter. Where can you help people save one or all four of these? Time. Where are you saving them time? How can you shortcut their success? How can you save them money? And so for some of you, you might be very modest about this. And maybe you need to talk to a friend, a sister, a colleague, what have you, and be like, This is what I'm going to put out there as a membership. Do you think it saves you time, money, energy, or brainpower?\
\
[00:16:21.810] - Sandra De Freitas\
Really just say that because you may not see... You're so expert in this that you don't even see how you're saving them these four things, but they will see it. And guess what? You put this on your sales page and people will be flocking to it. Just amazing because if you can save them any of these four things, nobody wants more on their to-do list. Nobody wants to spend more money on something. Nobody wants to spend more time on something. And they rather use their brainpower for other things. So this is key. So what to offer in your publisher membership? What are you known for? What are you known for? So what do you want to be known for? And what comes easily to you, but is a struggle for others? I think this is the question for all the bloggers. What comes so easily to you, but is a struggle for others? Outside of writing, Writing is a struggle for me. It is a struggle for me. But all the bloggers are great writers or you're good enough to be a blogger. I could not be a blogger. I've tried. But what in your subject matter comes so easily to you, but is a struggle for others.\
\
[00:17:30.300] - Sandra De Freitas\
If you're not sure what this is, go ask a friend, go ask a colleague, what is it that I do that you wish you could do faster or you wish you could do, period. And they will tell you exactly what that is. Okay, next, you've got, if you don't know what to offer, you could ask them. So there are times where we have opportunities where people can ask me questions. So you can see three years ago, I arrived in an appointment 30 minutes early and I was like, okay, what am I going to do now for the next 30 minutes? I don't even know how I arrived. It was not intentional. I had it in my calendar for a certain time and they're like, oh, you're really early. I'm like, oh, okay. So I just put it in my calendar wrong. So I thought, okay, I'm 30 minutes early for an appointment. I thought, I do a Q&A or ask me anything. What can I help you with? What questions can I answer for you? What I love about this is that the questions people asked were things that I didn't think about. There were things that I wouldn't have considered that they were even thinking about.\
\
[00:18:28.700] - Sandra De Freitas\
Because when we're experts, we're so high up the, I want to say the ladder, the mountain, that we haven't looked back and we forget what it's like for someone who's beginning or intermediate. So these are great if you don't know. Okay, what content do you give your readers that you could give an upgrade to? So for instance, if you have a blog about for teachers, could you give those teachers lesson plans every month? If you already have some products that you sell, there are a lot of teachers that have blogs, and then they sell things on... They sell the templates or the Google Docs or the Google presentations. Can those be part of your membership? Here are some ideas. You've got step-by-step tutorials, video demonstrations, behind-the-scenes. I love a good behind-the-scenes. Look, if you're a teacher and you show behind the scenes of how you set up your classroom, all the new teachers wouldn't want to see that. If you're a teacher and you're setting up for Halloween, all the teachers want to see your ideas for that. Oh, my goodness. Would they not love behind the scenes? Everyone loves it. Why? Because there's always something in there that we never thought of that we see you do.\
\
[00:19:44.790] - Sandra De Freitas\
It's eye-opening to us. It's like, wow, I can't believe you do it that way. Or behind the scenes of how you prep something on a Google Doc or on a spreadsheet. I can't tell you how many times I've done that and people are like, I didn't know that was a function personality, or that was an easy way to format that, or I didn't know you could do that in a Google Sheet. Behind the scenes are fantastic for that. Also, people are nosy. They want to know what you're doing behind the scenes. But behind the scenes are fantastic. You can offer a behind the scenes in your membership. Amazing. Sometimes this behind the scenes could just be like, what's going on in your life or how the blog is doing or what content you're coming up with. Maybe they get a sneak peek as to what is coming up in the blog. If you wanted to, you could do audits or feedback. So My client who does, she has a fashion blog and then she has a fashion membership, they actually have people submit outfits. They take pictures of their outfit and then they provide audits or feedback, whichever word you want to use.\
\
[00:20:45.060] - Sandra De Freitas\
And they do it in a very nice, kind way. This is not like a, do you remember the show, what not to wear? It is very kind. And so they might say, Hey, you might want to try a necklace with that, or you might want to try smaller earrings, or whatever it might be. But they provide audits and feedback. I absolutely love that because there is nothing like getting that personalized attention, but also everyone else can learn from it as well. You've got your Q&A, probably one of the easiest ones that you could offer. Remember, pick four of these. Do it with me. Let's say you do a baking or a recipe blog. There are times where I'm just like, I wish I could just watch them create it from beginning to end. Show me how you're doing it. And yes, there's a lot of YouTube videos out there. But if this was a community event and you could ask questions. So for instance, those of us with food intolerances could say, Hey, is there another substitute for this flour or even this gluten-free flour because I can't have this in it, they can answer it right then and there.\
\
[00:21:52.810] - Sandra De Freitas\
Or you, as the expert, will answer it right then and there. It is just a fantastic way. So people could actually bake with you at the same time or cook with you at the same time. Or if you do art, they can do the art with you at the same time. And that is a huge community builder. That is a fantastic thing. By the way, some of these you may not be able to do every month, but you could add them as bonuses to your membership When you feel like you want to connect with your audience more, you want to amp up the engagement, or perhaps you want to amp up retention, which is the thing, too. Yes? All right. Now you might think, well, do I didn't even have any content? Search your Google Drive. Go to Google. I went in to my Google Drive and I just searched up membership. I had all these different things that I had put together. I forgot about different ways. I went in and I would take this content and then I would upgrade it. If you've got a Facebook group or one that you're very active in, or even one that has your target people in it, I want you to go in there.\
\
[00:22:54.180] - Sandra De Freitas\
In the search bar, I want you to click or type in your subject matter and then the word question. Now, you You could also just put in your keyword, and then I could take that and be like, I could easily come up with answers to this. I could easily create a step-by-step guide or a do it with me or what have you. So you could also search Facebook itself. So if you go into Facebook on the top left, you'll see this. What I like to do is I like to take it a step further and I post from and I say your groups and your pages. So these are all the groups that I'm in, whether I'm the owner of them or just in them. And pages. I will look at what are people asking about in terms of all this content. And sometimes I'll even find my own answers. And then ask your people. When I was creating my membership, Engaged groups membership, back in May 2019, I asked this question, I'm wanting to put in a membership. Here are my ideas, here are the deliverables. What would you like? And then I had a lot of answers, and I took the top one there, and I made that my membership.\
\
[00:24:00.030] - Sandra De Freitas\
So I had templates, things that they should do every single month. May 23rd, I went live and I revealed my membership. Now, if you think you need to wait so you have everything polished and ready to go, I will tell you you don't. And let me tell you how I know this. My hair is messy. This shirt is so cold and wrinkly. I launched this membership. Within five minutes, I had eight people join me. And by the end of the week, I had 97 people join this membership. I kept the cost low because I wanted to really fill it with a bunch of people. I wanted to get feedback. I wanted to get testimonials. I wanted to get them results. I wanted to get them talking about it. And that's exactly what we did. So remember, May seventh, I was asking for ideas. May 23rd, I launched it in 16 days. It wasn't pretty. And in fact, I said to them, the content will start going live June first, and we did it. So some promotion ideas for you. You can create your own ad on your blog. You can email your list if you've got one.\
\
[00:24:58.810] - Sandra De Freitas\
Create multiple blog posts that would drive people to the membership. So I know you know how to do that. And you can also host a Zoom or a live community call to announce it. Just be like, Hey, we don't get together. We should get together. Why don't you come to my call? And you can say, Bring your favorite beverage, bring your favorite whatever hat, whatever you want to do, bring your favorite baking good, whatever is related to your blog, and let's get together. And you can tell them all about it. Say, People have been asking me for the step by step on this. People have have been asking me how I do this. People have been asking me how it takes me five minutes to plan my year or whatever it might be and say, How would you like to do that? I'm going to save you time, money, energy, and brainpower. Would you like to come and join us. So point people to your membership at the end of each blog post. You could do that too. Of course, it all depends on what your arrangements are with brand ambassador stuff, sponsorship stuff, and ads.\
\
[00:25:58.680] - Sandra De Freitas\
But these are just and then add a membership or shop button on your blog. I know this sounds obvious, but it's something we forget about. So add it to your menu bar. Next steps. Ask your audience what it needs. Create a list of upgrade experiences, the content you have, questions. Promote it. Deliverable ideas. Okay, so here are some ideas for you. We've got audits. I've talked about this one before. Challenges. You can do a monthly challenge. You can do a quarterly challenge if you wanted to offer it as a bonus. You can do checklist for them. Everyone loves a quick checklist. Great for them. A community. I always mark my community as a bonus because if someone doesn't want to join the community, it's fine. You can create some done for you services. I've seen people do this for teacher planning for teachers. All done for them. You can have guest coaches or guest speakers as one of your deliverables. You've got templates that you can create for them, webinar slides, lesson plans, business plans, project plans, you name it. Would you like more than 80 membership deliverables? I'm giving them to you for free.\

Normally, I sell this as $9. Is that part of one of my main courses? This is called Structure and Style. The Structure and Style course is the starter course to build a membership. So if you're thinking about building a membership, I highly recommend you go and grab that. In fact, when you sign up for this, you will get $100 off the structure and style course. Let's go into pricing. I want you to make this price a no-brainer. I can talk about pricing, but everyone in every industry is going to be different. I want you to think about your pricing. But what I want you to do is make it a really easy yes, especially the beginning, especially the very first launch. So if it's $20 a month, is that going to make or break them? I want you to think about is also the pricing for the year. So you can offer a monthly, annual. If you're not sure you want to do this for an entire year, do not offer an annual. You could offer quarterly, but you have monthly and you have annual. What I do is I take the monthly plan and I multiply by 10 to get the annual.\
\
[00:28:01.410] - Sandra De Freitas\
So it's for those who can't do math in your sales page, I'll say it's like getting two months free, and that's really easy for people to calculate. So for founding members, because they're early adopters and they're coming in with either little or no content already available, give them the best rate. So whatever you think you want your membership to be, maybe lower it down a little bit just for the founding members, just for the first group of people to come in. And you could say the first hundred or the first hundred before February first or February first or the first hundred, whatever comes first. That's up to you. But I always like to give them a bit of a price discount. Why is that? Well, they're coming in. There's very little content for them to begin with. They're taking a chance on you. They are going to provide feedback to make your membership better. They're going to provide the testimonials to make your membership better, and they're going to need this incentive to join. They're going to start telling people about this. The better it is, the more people you can get in, Just like I did for my membership, my membership was like $25 a month or $250 for the year.\
\
[00:29:05.130] - Sandra De Freitas\
It is double that price now, but I kept it low for a reason because I really wanted a bunch of people in. Here's what we went over. We went over memberships, how they're a powerful revenue rating tool. There's benefits to it, lots of benefits. We went over your target market, the publisher model for bloggers, what to offer, looking at the content you have, looking at the content you create, and pricing. So turning your expertise Get into a membership site can be a game changer for your blogging career. Embrace the opportunity to monetize your knowledge, build a loyal community, and create sustainable income stream. If you want to come and follow me, go to engagedgroups.com/group.

[00:00:12.250] - Sandra van der Lee\
Hello, hello. Hi. I am so glad that you decided to sign up for the Blogger Breakthrough Summit. I'm Sandra van der Lee. Nice to meet you. Nice to see you. If you haven't seen me before, this session is all about five emails you can send to sell more your digital products. If you haven't met me yet, I talk fast. I like being short, simple, to the point and effective. So I'm not going to do a whole lot of fluff. The goal is very simple. We want to sell more products with email. So before we do all that, you're going to meet the hostess with the mostest. That's me over here. I'm going to tell you about the five emails you need to send. And we're going to talk about the one mistake that you really need to avoid that I see happen again and again. And then I'm just going to give you the next step of, Hey, now you have this information, what can you actually go ahead and do with that? So if you don't know me yet, I was never properly employed in a 9:00 to 5:00 by [inaudible 00:01:13] , all of that jazz. I went straight from a two years Master of Science degree.\
\
[00:01:17.780] - Sandra van der Lee\
So theoretically, I'm a researcher and I have an engineering title to being self-employed. This used to say I'm a rehabilitating digital nomad, but actually, I am rehabilitated Because this is the first time I am recording in my brand new apartment where my name is on the lease. We're on the hook. I moved to a brand new place, which I'll tell you very, very shortly about, just so you have some idea about who I am. But it's been about seven years. When I got started in the online business, I had no network, I had no experience, and I really didn't have a clue. And things were tough until about three years I think at this point, that should even say four years ago, maybe five. But things were tough, right? If you don't have a network, if you don't have the experience, if you don't really know what you're doing, it is really rough. And at some point, I still intensely remember the moment where I was sitting behind my desk and I literally sat there and I said to myself, Hey, if I don't make this amount of money by the end of the year, I'm going to have to get a job.\
\
[00:02:27.160] - Sandra van der Lee\
It was like, This is going to happen. You're going to make that $5,000 a month mark, or you're going to find a job, which was basically what I needed to pay myself as average as salary. I knew that that's what my business needed to make. At that point, I decided that most advice was bullshit, and the only thing that really mattered was sales, selling, sales. Funny story, I hit my first five figure month, six weeks later. So that is the power of a decision for you. So back in 2022, I 3.5X my revenue to 150K. Still completely solo, like 99% of the time, it's just me. I occasionally have a virtual system that will work 10 hours a month for me. I've hired, I've outsourced, but usually it's like this business is 100% me. Then in 2023, things took a turn for the crazy. I invested $100,000. I don't even want to talk about how much money that is, into my second business so I could get an investor visa and move to the United States. 2024 was the year of a sabbatical waiting on visa approval, meeting the guy I now live with, way back in February of 2024, and romance, and life just lifeing all over the place, and finally moving across the ocean to an entire different continent, trying to rebuild a whole new life, basically.\
\
[00:03:55.720] - Sandra van der Lee\
So that's the last couple of years. If I should have probably about my experience. If you don't know, the other company I'm known for is Damn Copy. I've written hundreds of sales pages, hundreds to thousands. I haven't counted of sales emails. I make six figures a year just from writing and sending my own emails, I wrote the copy behind some really big launches and successful products. I know what's up, basically. If you overspend with certain business owners that you like and whose face might on this summit, it might have been my fault. I do not feel bad because my clients will create really great stuff. So let's dig in. Before we begin, I hate that this needs to be said, but all of this is copyrighted material. You have a single-use license to watch this. Use the information for your business. Please do not turn around and replicate, create derivative products, teach this material as your own, or any of that sketchy stuff, right? Not allowed. Don't do it. Now, what if sending emails was equal to making sales? To do that, there are five basic emails and principles that you will want to hit.\
\
[00:05:09.640] - Sandra van der Lee\
So the five emails, and I'm going to tell you more about all of these individual emails, but the five emails are the, Yeah, That full on energy. I can tell I'm waving outside of the screen. I'll try to keep my entertainment or my excitement contained. So we have the excitement, the yes, the hell yes email. We need to talk about the who even cares email. We're going to talk about the FAQ email. We're going to talk about social proof, which again is super important. And then finally, the decide, damn it email. Those are all the five emails you will need to sell more of your products, more of your courses, more of anything, really. The yay email, the very first email, this email is all about sharing your excitement. It's all about introducing the offer, the product, the sale, the discount, the buy one, get one, whatever it is you're promoting. This is about introducing it and about sharing your excitement about it. And if this is tough for you, if you cannot come up with excitement for the offer you're making, you might be making the wrong offer. You might need some other tweaks.\
\
[00:06:15.950] - Sandra van der Lee\
But this is really about, this is great. I have something for you. The energy or the vibe for woo attendees, the approach you want in this email is This is such a great freaking thing for you. If you get this email, you're lucky because here's what I got. This email is excited. Exciting for the people that need this product, which if you've built an email list around the subject that you do, should be every single person on there. That's email number one. Then email number two. This one is all about who even cares. I want you to share the benefit of what you do. Whereas email number one is like, Hey, here's this great deal. Here's the product. Here's what's included. I'm super excited. Go check it out. This one's really about, Why does this matter? Why does this product actually matter? Let's get really, really real about that. Because very often, what I notice is a lot of people we say surface level, right? But it's like, Why does your work matter? Why does this product matter? And this can be frivolous. I buy things for pleasure. I buy things for fun. I recently took up, so I moved to the United States, I took up a pottery class.\
\
[00:07:41.680] - Sandra van der Lee\
It is frivolous. It is indulgent. It is silly. We make stuff with clay, and it's pricey. Let's be honest about that. It's pricey. It's an expensive hobby, right? But it's great, and I love it, and it helps me relax, and it's a break from everything, and it makes sure that I'm not on my phone, and I'm creating something with my hands, and I'm filling up my house and all of my friends' houses with things that I made with my hands and painted, and put attention and intention into, right? That's why it matters. It's not like, Oh, yeah, you'll have a mug that you make yourself. Yeah, that's cool. That's what the thing is. But that's not why the thing is important. So I want you to dig deep on that one. Why does this thing matter? Then email three, the what the FAQ email. It's to answer any questions. Now, very, very frequently, this is a great place to address objections. So if people are like, I think I'm too advanced for this. I don't have this bit of knowledge. Is this still for me? I don't know if I'll be able to make the meeting.\
\
[00:08:46.770] - Sandra van der Lee\
That's a big thing for me. If there's a live component, I want to know when it is. You can very easily pull this from your sales pages. But if any questions have come in for email one or email two, or maybe you're doing a social campaign, maybe there's people that ask the same thing again and again. Is this a downloadable PDF? Is it a workbook? Are there videos? Are there trends? If you get that question more than once, that is a great question to preemptively answer. Because I don't have official statistics for us, but I feel like if one person asks you something, that means that there's at least nine other people with the same question who don't go through the effort or that don't want to be a burden, they don't ask. Now, this is a great because it's really easy to pull from your sales page. If you have a sales page with an FAQ or a checkout page where you answer some questions, you can literally send an email that's like, Hey, there's a couple of questions I've received about this product, with the product link. So I gathered them up and I'm answering them all for you.\
\
[00:09:46.760] - Sandra van der Lee\
Question one, answer one. Question two, answer two. Call the action to buy the product. Done. This is the easiest, one of the easiest. I think the last one that we're talking about is even easier. But that's really all there is to it. Then social proof. The social proof email is all about you bringing the receipts. You're showing what is possible. Now, I do want you to keep in mind that, especially if you're operating worldwide, if you have clients in the US, you're in Europe, wherever, there are regulations. You cannot be using fake testimonials. The FTC is cracking down. There's those sorts of hoopla, which, again, if you're an ethical business owner, if you use real testimonials, if you screenshot real stuff that people get. If you're honest about what you're doing, this isn't a problem for you. And don't pin me down. That's not legal advice. I know nothing. I'm a potato, not a lawyer. But social proof is all about showing what is possible, showing what other people have done with the program, showing other people's experience with you. At the end of the day, us humans, we're social creatures. We want to stick to the herd because that's safe.\
\
[00:10:57.200] - Sandra van der Lee\
So the fact that it was good and effective and other people got value from it makes your leads, make your email list, makes your people that are interested, your potential buyers. It makes them feel safe and that they can do it, too. So that's what's testimonials, screenshots, reviews, what that thing is all about. Then we've already gotten to the final email, and this is the decide, damn it, email. Now, this This is all about making a decision, about giving them a deadline. I know, especially if you work B2B, so if you work business to business, a lot of entrepreneurs are a little bit neuro-spicy. Whether they are on the autism spectrum, they might have ADHD, whatever it is, any of that, a lot of them have a certain time-blindness about them, or they need a deadline to help them make a decision. If there's no deadline, we're going to postpone making the decision. So the easiest way to do or to use that, that urgency that, Hey, it's fine whether you can buy it or not, but I need you to make a choice. Here's the deadline for it. So this is another really simple email.\
\
[00:12:16.280] - Sandra van der Lee\
It's literally, Hey, this offer for this is going away. The price is going up. The deal is ending. Buy one, get one is stopping. Free shipping is over. Whatever that is, there's so many hours left for this. Here's a big ass countdown Here's the link. Decide, damn it. That's your last email. Wow, I feel like I talked really fast through that, which is great for you because then you have more time to watch more of these fantastic presentations. So your next steps, based on this, is to come up with a product that you want to promote over email. I want you to figure out some urgency for it. It needs a deadline. Maybe there's a discount. Maybe there's a limited time bonus. Maybe there's a limited number bonus. Only the first 5 people, the first 10 people, not the first 20 people. Maybe the doors are closing. You're going to make it. It's not available anymore. You buy it now or you can wait until it becomes available again. Maybe the price is going up. But I want you to come up with a product that you want to make more sales off, do something special for it.\
\
[00:13:24.890] - Sandra van der Lee\
And then I want you to go ahead and write these emails that I just talked to you about and send them out over three to four days. So the easiest thing to do is if you do three or four days, you have one email each day, two on the last day, or you have, if you want to do it in three days, you do two on the first day, one on the middle day, two on the last day. More is fine. Less is not so fine. I just want to put that out there, but more is fine. Now, for bonus points, what you can then do is you take the emails that you've written and you repurpose these for social media. If you read my emails or you see my Instagram posts, I occasionally do that where I'm like, Oh, that's a great email. I'll pull the email, I'll post it to Instagram, I'll call it a day. Finally, sell more products. That's what you need to be doing. I think that this really will help you. So before we wrap up, because I have an awesome gift to help you out, too, I want to make sure that you do not make this mistake.\
\
[00:14:29.480] - Sandra van der Lee\
And that is that you let people that unsubscribe stop you. If you send more emails, you will get more unsubscribes. That doesn't mean anything is wrong. If you send more emails and you sell in them, and I see this more of business to consumer than with business to business clients, you might even deal with a hater or two. People might come back and be like, I never signed up for this. And it's like, spoiler alert. Yes, you did. Otherwise you wouldn't get the email. Or it's, Wow, it's so selfish of you to sell, and you shouldn't be selling, and da, da, da, da, da. If you feel bad about selling when the world is chaotic, I have a podcast episode. I have a podcast episode titled Should You Sell When the World is on Fire? And it's episode 11. So if you go to sandravanderlee.com/podcast/11, you will land on it. If you have ever felt uncomfortable about someone selling when in your opinion it was a rude or a bad time to do so, or if you're the person that is selling while everyone else, you shouldn't be selling, we're preoccupied with this thing that's happening worldwide or locally, please go and listen to this.\
\
[00:15:44.410] - Sandra van der Lee\
It's going to help you change your mind. It's going to help you do it any way. It's going to help you do what needs to get done. It's honestly, it's my most downloaded podcast episode ever. So, yeah, go find that episode 11 on becoming unapologetic. The podcast, sandravanderlee.com/podcast/11 If someone shows up and tries to shame you for selling over email, even though they signed up, do not, under any circumstance, let that stop you. That's the one thing I want you to take away. For benchmark reference, a very normal unsubscribed rate per email that you send is 0.25%. So that means that if you email 400 people, you will get one unsubscribed. That is completely fine. If you're going to do much, much higher than... If you have a small list, okay, first of all, if you have a small list, don't worry, because the math on that is different. Because if you have 100 people and one person unsubscribes, now your unsubscribed rate is one I forgot how many people I said there. So if it's small, do not worry as much, right? Because even one unsubscribed can be like, oh, big percentage. If you have a big list, if you have whatever, if you have more than a thousand people, like 0.25 % is normal.\
\
[00:17:02.310] - Sandra van der Lee\
And for sales emails, that might go a little bit higher. During Black Friday, that might go higher. If we're overwhelmed and busy, that might be a little bit higher. But if you're somewhere around that number, do not worry about the unsubscribed. That is the very, very big one I want you to take away. Now, what about your actual newsletters? Because we've talked about sales email campaigns. Well, we've just discussed that's a campaign. But what about your normal newsletter? Maybe you send a weekly newsletter or a daily or any option in between. If you send a newsletter less than weekly, we got to talk because that's not enough. But you need... Yeah. Let's assume you're sending out that weekly newsletter. What about it? Well, if you need help for how do I write a newsletter that also sells for me, I have a really cool freebie for you that I very aptly named salesy Newsletters or the Salesy Newsletters Toolkit. Inside it, you will find five Salesy newsletter prompts. That doesn't seem like a lot, but first of all, one, they're created by a human. That's very good at this by me. This is not a list of 99 ChatGPT prompts that a robot came up with based on all the media for shit it's read on the internet.\
\
[00:18:11.840] - Sandra van der Lee\
These are super strategic. They were And I went through them. I was like, I can probably come up with a year's worth of email just based on these five prompts. I have 25 subject lines for you. So that's five subject line per prompt that you can mix and match with. Again, they're tested, they're There's different things to play around with. You can just fill in the blanks and use them. I have 18 different calls to action based on how you sell. So maybe it's like you need someone to reply with something. Maybe you just wanted to go to a page. Maybe they need to book a call or fill out an application. There's 18 different calls to action for you to play around with, to mix and match. And then I have the six very simple steps to write a newsletter that will sell any type of offer that you have. So this is not just for digital products or courses. If you do services, if you do coaching, if you do consulting, this is for you and it will help you. It basically has the anatomy or the framework you need to write a newsletter that will sell your stuff.\
\
[00:19:12.060] - Sandra van der Lee\
So you can go ahead and grab that for free on sandravanderlee.com/salesy-newsletters That link will also be somewhere below to the site next to my presentation. And I highly recommend that you grab that. Now, that was it for me. I am going to be around in the community. So if you have any questions, just feel free to tag me. Let me know. I really, really hope that you're going to send more emails and sell more of your products. Thanks so much for listening and enjoy the rest of the summit.\

**Transcript:**\
[00:00:14.040] - Sasha\
Hello, everyone. My name is Sasha Hutchison aka, your frugal friend, and I'm very excited today to talk to you about turning a freebie into a high-value digital product. So, if you don't know me, my name is Sasha, and I am a top one person seller over at Etsy. My etsy shop is yourfrugalfriend.etsy.com. I have over 14,000 sells, and I love creating digital products that add value to business owners and also just regular consumers who love to consume digital products.\
\
[00:00:46.990] - Sasha\
I've also created courses that help sellers in the digital product space level up their products and marketing strategies. I'm also an Etsy coach who is passionate about helping people just like you make more money with your digital products business. I coach bloggers who want to sell their stuff on Etsy. I coach Etsy people who want to sell stuff on their blog. Digital products are a huge, huge, huge path to making lots of passive income and money for your business.\
\
[00:01:16.060] - Sasha\
And also, digital products are a great way to get optins to your email list. People love digital products. Okay, so what are we going to learn about today? Well, we're going to talk about what are typical freebies, how you can turn a freebie into a paid product, and how easy is it to do. So, freebies are usually digital products like printables that you give away for an email optin.\
\
[00:01:42.760] - Sasha\
You probably have a ton yourself or you've been told that you have to do these freebies to get email optins, stuff like that. And they can be anything, really. I think a lot of people default to printables because it's simple, but you can do things like ou know ebooks that are with fillable form fills. You can do canva templates, you can do spreadsheets. There's so many things that you can turn into a freebie.\
\
[00:02:08.620] - Sasha\
So, how can you turn your freebie into a paid product? You can create an editable template that's like a canva template. You can create fillable forms that would be with fillable form fillups that you make in a program such as like, Adobe DC. Digital planner products, you can make those in tons of platforms. Or you can actually turn existing products to a spreadsheet. I think people, they think spreadsheets are something that can only be used for financial products, but really, you can turn anything into a spreadsheet.\
\
[00:02:34.920] - Sasha\
Like, people love to buy grocery list spreadsheets, habit tracker spreadsheets. I mean, it's endless. So, how easy is this to do? Well, retooling your freebie into a high value product is a lot easier than you think. Everything on the market now is so easy to use now.\
\
[00:02:51.710] - Sasha\
So, the myth, I need to be tech savvy to be able to create high-value digital products. Well, no, that's not true. All you need is a desire to learn to be successful creating these types of products. When I started creating digital products in 2019 as a side hustle, they were just printables. And I learned how to use Canva in the weekend and I launched my shop and by three months, I had made $100 and had sold like a 100 products.\
\
[00:03:15.630] - Sasha\
And I was selling low-value products. But I also wanted to start a blog and put these single-page printable products I was selling in my Etsy shop on my blog and get subscribers. And I was able to do this really quickly and easily, teach myself almost everything. And it was super simple. So, you don't need to be super tech savvy to do this, to create high-value freebies.\
\
[00:03:41.960] - Sasha\
Another myth, the programs that you need to create these types of products are too expensive. No, they're not. So creating high-value digital products can be done for free or for a small fee. I did everything for free until I hit 500 sales in my Etsy shop. It was kind of my benchmark to pay for products.\
\
[00:03:57.760] - Sasha\
And now, in hindsight, I regret not spending a little bit of money to save myself time making these amazing high-value digital products. Because I was able to scale so much more quickly and create products that people really wanted once I paid for a couple of programs that are super cheap to use.\
\
[00:04:19.010] - Sasha\
Okay. So, let's cover first what is an editable template, because I think some people get this confused, but also people use the terms fillable and editable interchangeably. So, if you're thinking about a fillable form or something for like Adobe that you'd use in Adobe Reader, like printable with fillable form fields. That's actually a fillable PDF but people sometimes call editable, I will use the term editable for SEO because that is something that people think of and they're using as a term. But actually, an editable template is something like a Canva template that you create and then you share the template link. And someone can edit that design on their own computer and customize it for their own needs, for whatever they want to do with it. So, how much do these editable programs cost?\
\
[00:05:10.920] - Sasha\
Well, Canva is free to use and you can create editable templates on it now. You didn't use to, you had to have Canva pro, but now Canva free is an option. Just know that with Canva, you have to create your own template to share to give us a freebie. Or if you're going to eventually sell it or whatever, you can't use the canned templates in Canva to do this. You have to create your own design, but it's very simple to do.\
\
[00:05:36.410] - Sasha\
It's super quick to learn. So that's something to keep in the back of your mind when you're doing these things on Canva. Corjl is another program. It's super popular in like, the wedding space. So, let's say you're a wedding blogger and you want to give away a customizable or editable wedding sign that people can customize because you want to eventually upsell them on like your invitations that you have as a digital product or something.\
\
[00:06:04.030] - Sasha\
Well, Corjl is a program that they can go in and the biggest, the biggest thing about Corjl that is a huge selling point for people is they can get a demo link with Corjl to test out the product before they buy it, have a watermark on it, they can demo it, and then they can convert. So, if you're giving that away as a freebie, you may be able to convert people that way because they're able to see how awesome it is and then they can potentially buy like whatever wedding package you have. It does have a much higher cost to using the program. It has tiers like 799 is if you sell one to fifty products a month, and then it goes up in price, and plus they charge you a fee for every template you sell. So, if you're doing it for freebies, you might think about maybe doing a Canva template to start and then Corjl or something, whatever you want to do.\
\
[00:06:53.520] - Sasha\
Templett is another editable template program. It's cheaper than Cordial and people use it for the same purposes as Corjl. It's very similar, it just has a different pricing scheme, but it's pretty cheap to start. So, those are things that you can look into to creating an editable template for your freebie and not just giving them like a PDF printable or something. Okay. So, what is a fillable product?\
\
[00:07:17.980] - Sasha\
So, a fillable product is a document with syllable form fields or calculated fields. And that would be like a fillable form field. If you don't know what this is, you may have gotten a W nine to fill out or W two, and you type in your information and then you save it and you send it back. Those would be fillable form fields. Other things that you can do with these programs that create fillable form fields is you can have it do drop down to dates, you can do checkboxes, you can allow them to customize the font and the font size, font type, and you can also add calculated fields.\
\
[00:07:57.460] - Sasha\
So, the programs that are most popular to do this in is, number one is PDF Escape. It's free to use. The downside to PDF Escape is that it's very laborous and tedious to use. They don't make it easy to use it for free. And you can only do fillable form fields that are text fields and you can do checkboxes and not much else.\
\
[00:08:18.120] - Sasha\
You can do a simple checklist in this and it's great for that. But if you want to do anything a little more sophisticated to make your freebie more high-value, you might want to opt for something that is a paid program. So, I'll jump down to Foxit. So, Foxit $79 a year, has similar limitations to PDF escape, but it is a lot easier to use. But yet again, it can't do calculated fills or anything with a lot of pizzazz.\
\
[00:08:43.810] - Sasha\
So, then Adobe DC, this is my favorite. It is the gold standard when it comes to creating syllable products and fillable freebies and stuff like that. If you opt for the annual plan, it's $19.99 a month. And then what I did in the beginning, because I am a super cheap and frugal person through and through, I decided to get the seven-day free trial. After I made a bunch of printables, I wanted to make fillable. And then once I got through my seven-day free trial, I'll turn on the subscription for 29.99 a month, make all my fillables with documents, with, like, calculated fields and like customizable font and all that stuff, and then I'll just turn it off.\
\
[00:09:31.260] - Sasha\
So, you'd be spending a small amount of money to earn a lot more money, so it's a great investment. And that's what I was saying in the beginning. I spent a lot of time with, like, PDF escape. It was very tedious.\
\
[00:09:43.420] - Sasha\
It was so hard to use. And then when I went over to Adobe DC, I was like, oh, my god, I can create ten products for every one product in this program. Same with Foxit. It's a little more tedious, but at least, it's an option if you wanted to create a little bit more polished forms, but not with a lot of functionality.\
\
[00:10:01.760] - Sasha\
So, the next, what is a digital planner? If you don't know, a digital planner is a digital version of a traditional paper planner, and it can include hyperlinks. So, these are really great. You can actually market your freebie optin to be used in a digital planner. So, for example, I sell, like, savings trackers in my etsy shop.\
\
[00:10:25.780] - Sasha\
I've also given away this little saving star with the balls in it that people can color in, and people will grab that, and they'll upload it into their digital planner, and then they'll color it in with their apple pen on their tablet. And I didn't even market it to do that. And knowing now what I didn't know then is that you can market every single PDF product you have to be uploaded into a digital planner to be used as a digital planner insert. That's the word for it, an insert.\
\
[00:10:58.680] - Sasha\
So, definitely, if you feel like you have products like mood trackers or bullet journal inserts, or even, like, recipe templates or anything that you feel like would be used really well on a note annotation app, that's an app like good notes that people use for their digital planner. That's a, it's a note annotation app because you upload your digital planner and you write on top of it. So, it's like a template, you write on top of it. So, if you feel like you have a freebie that you can market that way, that would be a really, really good way to get optins on to your list for subscribers.\
\
[00:11:32.980] - Sasha\
And even then, you're not necessarily having to create a digital planner, but you're just marketing it to be used in one. And that in itself is assigning a higher value to your freebie printable. If you have a workbook or something, tell people they can upload it onto their iPad and write onto it in good notes or something. Okay, so let's say you wanted to create your own digital planner products to give away to your audience. Well, you can create them in keynote, and that is a free to use program, but it's only for people who use Mac computers.\
\
[00:12:09.100] - Sasha\
All are apple products. So, then there's Adobe InDesign, and that's what I use for my digital planners that I've created. And that's $35.99 a month. And yet again, I turn it on and then I turn it off, and that creates really great hyperlinked products. And Keynote does that too.\
\
[00:12:26.920] - Sasha\
Keynote is like the slide. It's a slide version of, it's a slide program, like PowerPoint in Microsoft products. It's the same thing. You can also create these digital planners in Microsoft too, so just know that. But I like Adobe InDesign because you can design everything in there, and you can also make it look really sharp and it looks really good.\
\
[00:12:57.270] - Sasha\
Same thing with Keynote. You can do that too, but you have to be someone who has a Mac or Apple product. So, Canva is another thing I think people overlook for creating digital planners, too. You can actually assign hyperlinks in Canva. The only limitation to Canva is that you can only do like 100 pages, I think.\
\
[00:13:19.780] - Sasha\
And so, if you're creating just like a simple notepad or workbook or something, think about using Canva to create your digital planner, or like, turning your workbook into a digital planner with hyperlinks. Because that's all a digital planner is, just a document hyperlinks that people can click on. And so, think about using Canva to create your digital planners. And it's a great way to retool your freebie into a product that can be used within the digital planner niche, because that is definitely a niche of people.\
\
[00:13:58.090] - Sasha\
Okay. So, spreadsheets, so spreadsheets are another option. And people are more familiar with spreadsheets than ever. So, Google Sheets, I feel like, has really opened up the opportunity to sell spreadsheets or give them away to freebies to people. Because all people need to use a spreadsheet nowadays, is a Google, a Gmail account. Most people have a Gmail email, and then they can use Google Sheets, and it can be used on a PC or a Mac.\
\
[00:14:28.500] - Sasha\
And that's great because sometimes I've noticed when I sell spreadsheets or I give them away, that people who try to use it on like, numbers, which you see there is an option for spreadsheets that has a limitation of what it can see with graphs. So, then you would just tell that user who has a Mac, like, just download this into your Gmail account and then open it in Google sheets and then use it. And they love that. They're like, wow, I didn't even know I could do that. And so if you wanted to make a spreadsheet, you can make one for free in Google Sheets.\
\
[00:14:58.930] - Sasha\
The only thing is it doesn't have as many bells and whistles and it won't look as pretty is something that you would create in Microsoft Excel. And Microsoft Excel now is so cheap, 9.99 a month. For personal use, super cheap. I use it, obviously, for my business, but it just creates these beautiful spreadsheets with lots of functionality. And like I said earlier in the presentation, you can turn anything, any kind of freebie into a higher-value product by turning it into a spreadsheet like that.\
\
[00:15:29.490] - Sasha\
Wedding planner, habit tracker, I've seen people do like grocery list, master cleaning lists, they've done recipe books. I mean, it's incredible what you can do with spreadsheets now. And people are more comfortable than ever using them. And it's a great way to get optins or to turn your optins into higher value products or whatever you want to do with it.\
\
[00:15:53.790] - Sasha\
But definitely, consider looking into turning a product you have that you didn't think you could turn into a spreadsheet into a spreadsheet because people love it. Because the spreadsheet, especially on Google Sheets, it can live in the cloud, and so they can access it from anywhere. Like, I look on my phone, at my budget, I have on my Google Sheets account. So, you can really create a freebie that people, high-value freebie that people use everywhere they go on their phone, at home. And then they're constantly seeing the thing that you created and becoming like a huge, raving fan of yours because of spreadsheets. All right. So, let's dive in.\
\
[00:16:32.580] - Sasha\
So, I'm going to give you three tips for creating high value digital products. Tip number one, decide which products that you already have created that you can make more valuable. All right, so have you created these? Printable planners, a printable guide of some kind, maybe some kind of keepsake printable, printable binder product, or ebooks, or workbooks.\
\
[00:17:00.410] - Sasha\
All of these can be made more valuable. So, with your principal planner, you can turn it into a digital planner, or you can put fillable form fields on it and make it something that people can type into and save in the cloud. You can also turn your principal guide into a higher-value product by maybe making it a canva template that your audience can use to make for their, to customize for their own business. And so that's a great thing you can do with that. So, keepsake printables so, like on handprint or footprint crafts or something like that, where you print it out and people can put their handprints on.\
\
[00:17:35.170] - Sasha\
You can put a fillable form filled on that for people to type in, like to grandpa from Timmy. And so that's another thing you do with keepsake printables. Printable binder products, this would be like in case of emergency binder products which are super popular right now. Putting fillable form fields in that makes it such a high-value product. People want to buy it because you know, if you want to be able to read your own handwriting or someone else's handwriting in the case of emergency, you definitely want to have it typed out and not handwritten.\
\
[00:18:08.460] - Sasha\
I have terrible handwriting, so when I use it in case of emergency binder, I'm definitely using one with fillable form fields, so people can read my handwriting. And that's definitely a higher-value product. If you give away maybe like an emergency contact list, it could be a one-page printable. And that could be like great for a mom blog or something to give for a babysitter or like an emergency information form for a pet sitter. If you add fillable form fields onto that then people are going to, they're going to want to grab it, they're going to want it, they're going to become an email subscriber for you. So, then we have ebooks or workbooks.\
\
[00:18:45.880] - Sasha\
These are great for people who are like coaches or if you are someone that has a food blog and you give people customizable recipe books. Then you can give them a Canva template or something or even like create a Corjl template with it, so they can create like a really highly valued keepsake family recipe book or something. So, you can do so much with your basic freebie printable products or something by turning them into higher-value products using different programs. All right.\
\
[00:19:16.540] - Sasha\
Tip number two, know the subscriber you are serving and what kind of program they would feel comfortable using. This is so important. So, questions to ask yourself do my potential subscribers want a high-value product?\
\
[00:19:32.100] - Sasha\
So, you may have something like just like a, a keto cheat sheet that's just a printable that they put out on their fridge or food that they can buy, and that they can buy the grocery store that meets their dietary needs. Well, I don't know necessarily if they need a high-value product for that. Would they want a canva template? Does that make sense for this type of freebie optin? Maybe you can add some fillable lines on the end, they can type in and then print it out.\
\
[00:20:01.350] - Sasha\
But you have to think about the person you're serving, the person you're trying to get optin and what their needs are. And if you're creating more work for them and if they are assigning the perception of having to do work when they get their optin to get the value from it. So, the number two, how much buying will I have to get from my subscribers to opt in for the high value product? And this is really important depending on the audience that you are serving. So, let's say that you are a business to consumer person serving that audience. So, for example, I am a person who sells Etsy products.\
\
[00:20:43.150] - Sasha\
My etsy shop. I serve many, many niches in my shop. It's kind of an emporium at this poin. But for someone who wants to buy, you know like a mom bucks or reward cards, you know little reward coupons for their kid, if I was to sell that as a Canva template, I probably have to get a lot of buying from that customer to buy it because they're going, what's Canva? Do I have to do all this work to get this product to be usable for my situation, for my intended uses. But if I was selling a workbook to a person who is another business owner, they probably are familiar with Canva and they feel comfortable buying that because they understand, I'm going to take this, I'm going to transform it, and I'm going to sell it or do whatever I want with that.\
\
[00:21:30.840] - Sasha\
So, you have to understand your audience and what they're buying is for the, for the freebie, or whatever you're trying to give them. So then, number three, well, the idea of getting this high-value product excite them. So, when I see a freebie that's just a picture of you know basic workbook, I'm like, I don't really care. It's not really exciting to me. What transformation is it going to give me?\
\
[00:21:56.770] - Sasha\
It's going to be something I can just pop up on my computer and type into and save with fillable form fields. I remember I was gifted by another business owner once. She was wanting to thank me for something, and she gave me this like 200 page planner. And I was like, wow, this is super exciting to get. It was like a content planner, but I noticed that it was just like twelve months printed out, so that's twelve pages, and then 52 weeks printed out with hardly any lines.\
\
[00:22:29.250] - Sasha\
And then, you get the point. It was just all these pages printed out of the same thing. And after I got it, I was way less excited about it because it didn't really provide me any extra value. It wasn't high value to me, and it didn't give me like, fillable form fields with like some stuff filled in for me to get me started thinking about my content creation. It was just so basic, wasn't exciting.\
\
[00:22:53.550] - Sasha\
So, definitely, think about how to excite them about your high-value products. All right, tip number three. You can sell your high-value product or upsell other products. And I think that this is a trap that a lot of bloggers get into. I know this because I coached them and they will say, I have all these freebies and I'm not getting subscribers.\
\
[00:23:17.340] - Sasha\
And I say to them, okay, well, have you thought about selling your freebie, you know? Because they'll usually have an Etsy shop and they're like, no, I never thought of selling my freebie. Well, I sell so many of the freebies, I give away on my blog, and I sell them 100 to one of how much I actually give them away on my Etsy shop. So, this is a freebie I gave away that's high value.\
\
[00:23:42.060] - Sasha\
And you have to think about you know exactly like, who am I serving, what entices them, what's going to make them excited. And so for this freebie, it's a freebie optin guide, 30 fillable, printable product ideas to sell. I got 767 subscribers in 90 days, and I made $632 in additional sales of Canva templates. It was twelve Canva templates to make fillable. And it's a complimentary product because I'm giving you all these keyword ideas.\
\
[00:24:14.530] - Sasha\
I do extensive SEO keyword research is why I've been so successful with my Etsy shop. And I just know SEO really well for selling things and creating things that have value. And I give people this list. It was free to optin, tons of subscribers, and I sold this complimentary product for people to make fillable.\
\
[00:24:34.530] - Sasha\
And then also I upsell my fillable PDF course to go along with it. And I understood how this was a super valuable freebie opt in. I know my audience. I also had affiliates promote this to their list because they know the value of fillable products.\
\
[00:24:52.060] - Sasha\
And then I promoted that complimentary products make more money. So, don't discount being able to sell your freebies, your high-value freebies as actual profitable products. I think that people overlook doing that and try doing that. Think about ways you can sell your freebie or sell complementary products to that freebie that adds a ton of value to your potential subscriber. All right. So, get more optins.\
\
[00:25:21.580] - Sasha\
Do market research to see what products you have created that you can make higher value. So, just write this information down, you know, see, brainstorm, think about what do I have that can turn into maybe a spreadsheet or a Canva template or whatever. So, research high-value opted ideas to get more subscribers. So, maybe see what other people are doing. See what other bloggers in your niche are doing to get what high-value optins are they doing?\
\
[00:25:48.940] - Sasha\
Is there something similar that you can do with your own existing freebies? And then also sell a complimentary product with your optin, or sell your optin online, such as on Etsy. So, like I said earlier, I sell every single optin I have as a product in my Etsy shop. And sometimes people don't want to give away that email address for a freebie.\
\
[00:26:08.880] - Sasha\
Sometimes they just want to give you their money. So, definitely, think of different ways you can use your freebie to make money, because you took time making that. So, you need to get something in return. And people want these high-value optins. All right, so what's my high-value product strategy?\
\
[00:26:24.630] - Sasha\
And it's to create fillable products through and through. Fillable products are extremely popular. Why? Because people are comfortable with these products. Almost everyone has Adobe Reader on their computer, or they can easily download it for free.\
\
[00:26:38.800] - Sasha\
This is on a Mac or on a PC. You can add fillable form fields to transform simple products. So, you can turn a simple budget, printable, one-page printable into a document with calculated fields that give people the power of spreadsheets at their fingertips. They can save it, they can put it in the cloud. You can do so much.\
\
[00:26:58.330] - Sasha\
You can create customizable bingo games. You can create extremely high-value checklists, workbooks, I mean, there's so much that you can do. It's what I did to blow away the competition on Etsy and make over 14,000 sales and become a top 1% seller. That's all I did is I added fillable form fields to basic products and with calculated fields and I destroyed the competition.\
\
[00:27:24.460] - Sasha\
It's totally worth it. Alright. So, I have a course on how to learn how to make fillable PDFs in one weekend. So, learn how to make fillable PDF documents easily and quickly. I go through a series of steps. So the beginner step would be to create just a basic menu planner.\
\
[00:27:44.860] - Sasha\
Because creating that high-value product with a menu planner is something people want to type it in. They share it with someone via email or in the cloud, or they print it out and fill in the fridge. People love that. And then also I teach you how to make simple, calculated filled on a carb counter. So, if you're in the fitness weight loss niche or whatever, you can actually create these calculated fields for carb counters.\
\
[00:28:06.210] - Sasha\
And it's super awesome. It's super fun to do. And then I take you up to creating a paycheck budget and that's with more complex, just calculate fields, tying things together. You get a really good deep dive of everything you can do with Adobe DC. And also, then I teach you how to make a customizable game because customizable games are huge and super popular right now.\
\
[00:28:30.040] - Sasha\
People love being able to customize games for like bachelorette parties. You know, like, who knows the birthday girl best, they can type in their own questions. People love that stuff. And I teach you how to do this with a free trial of Adobe DC.\
\
[00:28:42.930] - Sasha\
You can do it in one week. And then, like I said before, you can turn on subscription, turn more fillables, your printable products into fillable products, and then turn off the subscription, and just start creating higher value products. This is my favorite way to do it. Takes the least amount of tech. It's super fun to do.\
\
[00:29:01.690] - Sasha\
I've been doing it for years now and I've made a lot of money doing it. And I've gotten a lot of freebie options because of it. All right, so let's keep in touch, and I want to thank you for watching this presentation. I hope you learned some stuff. And definitely, reach out to me. Follow Me, your Frugal friend blog on Instagram and you check out my website at your frugalfriendblog.com. So, have a great day, and I hope to hear from you soon.\

**Transcript:**\
[00:00:11.940] - Shelley Marmor\
Hello there, and thank you for being a part of the Blogger Breakthrough Summit. I am so excited to be talking to you today about how to make a ton of money blogging with affiliate marketing. My name is Shelley, and I am going to tell you everything I learned on my journey to making big bucks doing this stuff with my blog. So here's me in Campeche, Mexico, in the Yucatan Peninsula, and here's what you need to know about me. In April 2020, I started my very first blog ever, ever, ever, ever and I made zero dollars that year, no big surprise there. Um, 2021, I discovered affiliate marketing, and I really decided to, like, dip my toes in although it was new and it was scary. And I ended up doing, okay, $8,490 that year. So first blog ever, I'm only eight, eight months in here because I didn't blog for all of 2020. I waited to start a travel blog till there was a global pandemic. But you'll see that the story turns out pretty, pretty good for me. So, 2021, things started looking up and I decided from there I'm going to double and triple down on this affiliate marketing thing. So in 2022, I got serious, like I told you, and I closed out that year at $272,569.\
\
[00:01:36.550] - Shelley\
So a lot is possible, and I was only in my second year of blogging with no prior blogging experience. So that's 3,110% more money in just one year. And before blogging, I was actually someone who works in corporate America, and there is no such thing as a 3,110% raise in one year. So this was astonishing to me. In 2023, I doubled my income again, and my story is pretty really incredible. I know that not everyone has success like this, but I also know that it's possible. But it landed me some really good features in some pretty prestigious places like Entrepreneur. I was on the Niche Pursuit Podcast and things like that. And I'm excited to be presenting to you today at the Blogger Breakthrough Summit. So, let's dive in. This is what we're going to be talking about. We're going to start with the big question, what is affiliate marketing and why I think you should be starting it now, not when you hit some magic number. We'll get into it. And the second thing is the right blog traffic, search intent, and buying keywords which I really think is paramount to understanding why I've been successful doing affiliate marketing. The customer journey funnel, if you have never heard of that, don't worry, you will be a customer journey funnel pro in no time.\
\
[00:03:03.890] - Shelley\
The number one mistake I think bloggers are making when it comes to affiliate marketing, and if you're doing it, why you need to stop ASAP -- and I'm going to give you three quick tips for affiliate conversions so you walk away with some actionable advice at the end of the presentation. And then if you stick around to the end, I have a freebie for you and I'll tell you where to grab it. So what is affiliate marketing? We have to know what we're talking about, right, to like understand it. So it's essentially selling the products, services, and/or goods of someone else, and then you making a commission from the sale, and you've probably already done it. So, if you -- if you have a hang-up a little bit on getting started or, you know, like a mental block on why you haven't got started yet, you've probably done this before. So, if this looks familiar, you're going to see where you've done affiliate marketing. So, let's say that's you and me and we're having a conversation and we both are two people who have sensitive teeth so you're going to ask me as a friend what do I think is the best toothpaste for us two people who have sensitive teeth, and I'm going to say Crest is the best for us.\
\
[00:04:14.730] - Shelley\
I have no idea. I don't have sensitive teeth. This is totally a hypothetical example. But if then you go out and you buy that toothpaste based on my recommendation, I've been an affiliate marketer for Crest, for Crest toothpaste. Unfortunately, in this example, I did not make any commission. But that's essentially affiliate marketing. It's me promoting, in this case, Crest and you buying the Crest, and I am so that middleman as a marketer. So, that's affiliate marketing. And like I said, you've probably already done it. So, when should I start doing affiliate marketing? Right now. I think bloggers should start right now. I think a lot of people get hung up on like I have to hit this number in traffic or I have to do these certain things and then I'll start. No, you don't have to hit any magic number and no, you don't have to do any certain things to get started with affiliate marketing. So a lot of bloggers are trying to get onto Mediavine which is a huge milestone and something to definitely be celebrated when you hit that magic number of 50,000 sessions which is what they require. And that's a session is essentially a person -- fifty thousand people coming to your site in a 30-day period.\
\
[00:05:32.230] - Shelley\
If you're new to blogging or you just haven't really hit that traction yet to where you're getting big and bigger numbers in traffic, that might seem impossible. It's not. I have three blogs on Mediavine. I should have a fourth one on in the next couple of months. So it's possible. But I think people get hung up a lot on that 50,000 number. So, if that's something maybe you identify with, don't let it stop you. Fifty thousand is a lot. It's doable, but it's a lot. So, if that's something, like I said, getting in your way, please stop -- please stop letting it. So it's a lot of traffic, as I've said. But with affiliate marketing, you don't need a lot of traffic. You just need the right traffic. So, what am I talking about? What's the "right blog traffic"? I'm going to tell you right now. The right blog traffic for affiliate marketers is the people who want to buy the things you're selling in that blog post. Sounds simple, right? So here's you and me again continuing conversation and if you're thinking like, but I'm not psychic I don't know who wants to buy what. Well, the good news is I'm not psychic either, but I do have an understanding of people who want to buy things based on the search terminology that they're using.\
\
[00:06:50.940] - Shelley\
So, don't worry. You don't have to be psychic. You don't have to hit 50,000 sessions to be an affiliate marketer, and you don't have to be psychic either. So, what you do need is to understand search intent. So search intent is the intent behind the search, just like the name says, or in other words, what the searcher hopes to find with that search, and there are a couple of different types of search intent. There's -- these are generally considered the main four. Some people say there's more than four. But for the purposes of, of what we're explaining today, you just -- these four should suffice. But if you Google types of search intent, you might see more on the -- on the list. So the first type is called informational search intent. So someone might look up what is SEO. Like, ask that question. This person just wants an answer to their question. They just want information. They don't want to buy my SEO course. They, you know, don't want to know how to start a blog. They just want to know what is SEO. They just want information. The second type of search intent is called navigational. This person might type in something or speak into Google, something like Reddit login.\
\
[00:08:02.760] - Shelley\
All they want to do is be navigated to the login page so they can log into their Reddit. They just want to be navigated. That's why it's called navigational intent. Another type, three and four can get -- overlap a little. So hopefully, this is going to explain it. Transactional intent -- I've also seen this called a branded search. So, this person is searching Nike sale. They don't want sneakers on sale. They don't want to know a comparison of sneakers. They want Nikes that are on sale, so that you can see just by typing in Nike or saying Nike into Google, it's become a branded search. They're not interested in Reeboks on sale. They're not interested in Pumas on sale. They want Nikes only. So that's why it's called a branded search. Commercial intent is someone who wants to make a purchase. They have a commercial intent like the name says, but it's not necessarily brand specific. So these people might type in or speak into Google best sneakers for runners. This commercial intent keyword can also be called a buying keyword or buying keywords. So I hope that made a clear distinction between transactional, commercial. But there is some clear overlap there.\
\
[00:09:15.540] - Shelley\
But the people we want to target as affiliate marketers are the commercial intent people. So, what are buying keywords? So I just mentioned it in the last slide a little. They're keywords that indicate the searcher is ready to buy or book, but they are not -- they are no longer browsing. So we're going to dissect this a little more with some examples because I know some of this stuff is easier -- we could talk about it in the abstract, but it makes sense with, with real-time examples. So I have some travel blogs. I have four travel blogs to be exact. So I use a lot of examples from travel, but this really applies obviously to every, every niche out there. No matter what site your niche is in this just comes straight from marketing. So, buying keywords in the travel niche, someone might type in best hotels in Paris, best tours in Paris, car rentals in Paris, airport shuttle in Paris, best luggage for these people, let's say best luggage for backpacking Europe, something like that. Those people are ready to buy. While, yes, sometimes browsing people who, who are bored or who are sitting in a doctor's or who are killing time at work till the end of the day they might Google best hotels in Paris.\
\
[00:10:35.150] - Shelley\
But by and large, the person searching that is ready to book a hotel. Browsing keywords, on the other hand, are things like, what's the best time to visit Paris? Is Paris worth visiting? Paris in the summer? Is Paris expensive? Is Paris safe? Things like that. These people are still just collecting information. They are browsing. Let's say you have the month of March off and you Google, what's the best time to visit March, and excuse me, visit Paris. And you see a lot of sites that bring up visiting in March. Like, it's so beautiful in the springtime. All the flowers are blooming, etc, etc. And you're like, oh, I have time off in March, like, that aligns perfectly. But you're still in that part of gathering. You're still in the gathering information phase of travel planning. You're not ready to book a hotel yet. You just wanted to know if it aligned that when you were able to travel is a good time to travel to that specific place. So, these are not the people that are ready to buy, so we shouldn't be pushing things on them. This is a huge kind of push back I get of people being like I don't want to do affiliate marketing because it's "salesy".\
\
[00:11:45.680] - Shelley\
It is to people like this that don't want to buy. But the people "googling" best hotels in Paris they're begging to know the best hotels in Paris. They're -- they have what I call a finger on the buy button, credit card in hand, they're ready to book. You are not being salesy to those people because they want to buy something. So this is a big distinction that I make. And I really think this is probably the most paramount thing that you need to understand in order to be an effective affiliate marketer people who want to buy and people who want to browse. Grey area keywords -- I have -- this has come up a lot. I do a lot of one-on-one work with private clients, and people will bring up what I have now labeled grey area keywords. So these are the ones that indicate that the searcher might want to buy or book, but they also might not want to -- and encourage people to stay away from these. Here a couple of examples, again from travel, but this applies to every niche. These are the big, big ones that I see in travel of best day trips from Paris. We'll just keep going with Paris.\
\
[00:12:55.660] - Shelley\
So, yes, someone might want to book a tour and they Google day trips from Paris instead of tours from Paris. But they also might want to rent a car and go on their own. They also might want to get on public transportation and go on their own. So there's a lot of what ifs here. This is a grey area, like I said. Now, how do we know these people don't want to book a tour? Well, we don't. But we also do know that the people who definitely do want to book Google tours in Paris. So this is why I say this is in a grey area. You see a couple more neighborhoods in Paris. People might do or make that blog post and put in a lot of different options of hotels that they want to book. Like I said, these people might want to book a hotel and they also might want just neighborhood recommendations. So they're just not far enough down the customer journey funnel, which we're going to get to, to guarantee that they're ready. The fourth one for travel bloggers, I see this one come up a lot packing lists -- so packing lists for Paris or for wherever.\
\
[00:14:08.100] - Shelley\
Now, why are packing lists in the grey area? Here is a screenshot from one of my niche sites. It is a packing guide to Tulum, Mexico. The number one thing I have on there is a SIM card. I genuinely believe that people going to Tulum, Mexico do want to have cell phone service when they get there. So, this is the first thing I put at the top of my packing list blog post. Now, someone might buy this. They very well might. However, someone who definitely wants to buy a SIM card for Paris, for excuse me, for Tulum and knows that they want to buy it and they don't need me to convince them, like I said, credit card in hand, finger on the buy button people they're going to Google something like best SIM card for Tulum. So, I still have, like, an uphill battle to convince these people that they want to buy a SIM card. I do genuinely believe that they do, like I said, but that doesn't mean that they're going to. Some people who are looking up a packing list online just want inspiration. They're not buying a single thing from your packing list. They're going to use whatever they have at home, or they're going to try to borrow something from a friend.\
\
[00:15:15.830] - Shelley\
They're just not buying. That's just not where they're at. They want to just know what to put on their packing list, and they'll figure out the rest, even if they have to like MacGyver some stuff for themselves. So they're just not buying. So that's why a packing list is in the grey area. I sincerely hope bloggers who want to make money doing affiliate marketing will avoid these types of pieces of content or just, you know, manage your expectations. Know that they're not really going to bring in, like, those big, big payouts month after month for you. To the customer journey funnel -- besides search intent and understanding buying versus browsing keywords this is the next most important thing that you need to understand about affiliate marketing if you want to make a ton of money doing it. So the customer journey funnel is essentially the buyer, or in your case, the blog reader's trip through the purchase funnel which I am about to show you. But just for reference, this can also be called the buyer funnel, the sales funnel, or anything with funnel at the end when we're talking about marketing is going to relate to this. So here's some illustrations so you understand.\
\
[00:16:25.880] - Shelley\
This is a four-step funnel. It covers basically everything you need to know on the topic of the customer journey funnel. But if you Google this, it's a big rabbit hole to jump down to. You might see much more elaborate funnels. You might see customer journey funnels that go into customer attention funnels. This is a huge topic. But for just to dip your toes in, this is as much as you need to know. And there's our two people jumping and back flipping into the top of the funnel at phase one which is called the awareness phase. So, the awareness phase is when someone becomes aware of a place they want to travel, let's say. This may or may not even come from you. They might see a really cool Instagram reel or TikTok of a place. They might watch a movie that's, you know -- they might watch the Emily in Paris on Netflix and decide they want to go to Paris. So, this doesn't necessarily come from you, but this is when the person enters the funnel at the awareness phase. After awareness, they move further down the funnel to the interest phase. So, this is when they're going to begin researching a place they want to go.\
\
[00:17:36.080] - Shelley\
So they watched Emily in Paris. They saw all the amazing, beautiful locations, and now they're going to Google something like best time to visit Paris. Is Paris worth visiting? Is it expensive? Is it safe? Those kinds of things that we talked about earlier in the presentation on gathering information. They just have informational intent. These people are not ready to book a hotel. They're not ready to book a tour. They're not ready to book a rental car. They don't want to buy a new backpack for backpacking Paris. They're just gathering information. Then they're going to go a little further down the funnel to the desire phase. So, let's say you saw your Emily in Paris. You looked up that time to visit Paris. It happens to be one of the months of the year you were considering. So now, you're going to go further down the funnel and your search intent is going to change and the things you search are going to change. So you might Google best neighborhoods in Paris, three days in Paris, or however many days like a Paris itinerary, a packing list for Paris. So this is exactly where we see our grey area keywords. But these are not the buyers.\
\
[00:18:45.520] - Shelley\
These are not finger-on-the-button, credit card, and hand buyers. Those people are down here the bottom of the funnel people. They want to book or buy, but they are not interested any longer in browsing. They've already gone through the whole funnel. They've done their homework, and they've researched as much as they needed to research. So, you saw Emily in Paris. You looked up the best time to visit Paris. It just so happens to be your birthday month and you're dead set on Paris now. Now you're looking at best neighborhoods in Paris because you don't know where to stay. You've looked -- you found the 9th Arrondissement and you're like that's where I'm going to stay. Now, you start "googling" best hotels in the 9th Arrondissement in Paris. You are ready to book your hotel. So, these are the people that we want the people in the action phase -- bottom of the funnel people that lead to conversions. Conversion is just a fancy word for sale where you convert a blog reader into a buyer. So, buying keywords this is what they're going to be searching in the bottom of the funnel purchase phase. Best hotels in Paris, like I said -- best tours in Paris,\
\
[00:19:56.900] - Shelley\
car rentals in Paris, travel insurance for Paris -- things that people book. Seem simple, right? Like sometimes you -- it doesn't -- it's not as simple until someone explains it, like, in real, just English terms. So this stuff is probably right in front of you the whole time. But like I said, I work with a lot of one-on-one clients, and there're people are like, wow, why didn't I get that. Sometimes you just need it explained. So, I hope that all made a lot of sense for understanding really the roots of affiliate marketing. So this is what I see the number one mistake travel bloggers make, or any bloggers, when it comes to affiliate marketing, it's what I have seen called the spray and pray or throwing spaghetti at the wall and hoping that something sticks. So, when you're not making content with user intent in mind, when you're just throwing spaghetti at the wall and you're happy that something sticks, I tell people you're putting in affiliate links but you're not necessarily doing affiliate marketing. So, when you're making affiliate marketing posts, posts that you hope to make a lot of money for you month over month while you sleep, I want you to ask yourself this before you make that post,\
\
[00:21:18.620] - Shelley\
is this a hell yes, a buying keyword. Is it a hell no, a browsing keyword. Or is it maybe a grey area keyword. I hope that you will only make those hell yes, buying keywords, bottom of the funnel, buying search intent posts because those are the ones you're going to see big money from in affiliate marketing. So, this is who I want you to picture. This lady sitting at her laptop, credit card in hand, big smile on her face, doesn't feel like you are salesy, completely ready to buy what you're selling. This is the hell yes, in action. This is who you want to be making content for in order to be a successful affiliate marketer. So, my best affiliate marketing advice is obviously, I've said it before, just to reiterate, stop wasting your time with the maybes. You want the hell yes people. So as promised, I want to leave you with some actionable items. For people who already have affiliate content, you can hopefully make some quick tweaks that are really going to be very effective. And if you've never made affiliate content, you can just implement these already. You don't have to redo any posts. So no matter where you're at these three quick tips should help you.\
\
[00:22:48.390] - Shelley\
Tip number one, what I call the feature box in the intro. You can see here that this is a blog post on Food Tours in Tulum. You can see the title at the top. Then I have my number one recommendation for the best food tour in Tulum right at the top of the post. People don't necessarily want to comb through 3,000 words on best food tours in Tulum to find the one that you think is best. So, I like to put these right in the intro to the article. I like to use wording like, don't have time to read the whole article, no worries, this is my best one. And I like to qualify or quantify why I'm calling it the best. In this case, you can't beat the ambience. You can see that it's a private dinner party in the jungle. So I'm saying you can't beat the ambience and the food. So something else there might work like it has 8,000 five-star reviews. So, it doesn't matter if you're qualifying with words or quantifying with the number. But I like to kind of just put the number one recommendation right at the top or, you know, a link to, to where they can book.\
\
[00:24:01.600] - Shelley\
I think a lot of affiliate marketers kind of bury their links. Again, a lot of people don't want to feel quote unquote salesy, but someone "googling" food tours in Tulum wants to book a food tour in Tulum. So, they're not going to really identify it as being salesy. They're just happy that they're finding someone that's producing content that, you know, is navigating them towards where they can find the best food tour in Tulum. So, don't hide your links. Okay. Here is tip two, make sure your links stand out. Like I said, I've worked one on one with a lot of people, and I've seen this more times than I wish I had, some people just have navy blue links and black text. And I'm like, oh, my God, I think people just aren't seeing your links. So make your links stand out. I use a theme called Kadence. It's a free theme. Yes, I run a multiple six-figure business on a free theme, and this is called -- I believe it's called highlight on hover. It's in the settings for the links, and I think other themes have different -- similar features but maybe with a different name. So the link is actually this pink, pink color, but when you hover it it highlights in that same color.\
\
[00:25:20.750] - Shelley\
So, there's no mistaking that this is a link. So, yeah, make sure your links stand out. And then tip three is use a clear and obvious call to action or CTA. So this is you can see down here, check rates and availability for this food tour. This is not the place to be creative just tell people what that link is going to lead them to do. So those are three quick tips I have for you. Key takeaway, I say this all the time to bloggers I am not special. I started this with no previous blogging experience. It kind of blew up for me. I definitely will never say that my experience is typical, but I'm not special. If I can, you can. That is what I told myself the whole time when I was coming up. So, I'm going to always just tell others the same thing. If I can, you can. If they can, I can. I just kept reading stories of successful bloggers, and I just was -- I decided if they can, I can. So, if I can, you can. Now, the freebie I promised you, the 5 Best Affiliate Marketing Programs For Travel Bloggers. It is a free video training. If you head to my blog about blogging travelblogging101.com,\
\
[00:26:47.210] - Shelley\
it's going to be the first thing you see on that page. And you just enter your email and I'll send you the free course and it'll help get you started on affiliate marketing with the five programs I recommend joining. These are also the five most lucrative ones for me. So -- and I've had a lot of people tell me that these end up being their most lucrative as well. So thank you so much for attending the Blogger Breakthrough Summit, for attending this session. I hope you got a lot of takeaways on understanding affiliate marketing. I hope I demystified it, and I hope you get started doing it ASAP. You do not need to hit any made-up magic number. So, good luck, and if I can, you can.\

**Transcript:**\
[00:00:12.070] - Stacy Coyle\
Hey there. Welcome to "The Love Factor: Applying Love Languages to Your Buyer Journey." Over the session, we'll explore a few different things. The first is busting some common buyer journey myths. The second is we're going to focus in on why your buyer journey matters, and how it could positively impact your business and your future sales. Then we're going to touch on the five love languages and then some examples of each of them in business. Also, we're going to wrap it up with when and how to actively and strategically apply love languages to your buyer journey.\
\
[00:00:48.120] - Stacy\
But first, let me introduce myself super quickly. I'm Stacy Coyle of "Workplace Lemonade," and I'm a purveyor of customer journey and buyer experience glow-ups, which is basically just a fancy way of saying that I am a customer journey and buyer experience strategist. So, I help digital business owners experiencing growth, realign their customer journey. And when I say realign, what I mean is does your current customer journey match both your audience's needs and your goals as a business? If those are not aligned, then your customer journey is going to really struggle to do its job. And then because the customer journey does not end at the point of sale, I also help digital business owners craft high-end experiences that wow their audience.\
\
[00:01:34.200] - Stacy\
So yes, that includes the buyer journey too. I've added a few things that I'm into at the moment. I'm calling these trends, but I guess the first one is less of a trend and more of just a state of being for me. I'm originally from Ireland, but I thought I'd mention it here in case you are wondering about my accent. I am putting you out of your suspense. I've really gotten into Dungeons and Dragons of late, and I'm currently playing a High Elf Warlock, or at least I hope I still am at the time you're watching this. And I really love binging K-Dramas. Korean dramas are just amazingly addictive. And then the last one, I guess, is less of a trend again and more of a lifelong aspiration in that I would like to be a cat lady. But I travel a lot at the moment, so it's not a good fit. But anyway, enough about me. Let's dive into the session.\
\
[00:02:26.080] - Stacy\
Let me clarify what I mean by buyer journey. So a buyer journey is anything that happens to your buyer once they hit the checkout button. Anything that they experience beyond that. Those are things like the Thank You page, maybe a welcome video, the welcome email, any email that they get in regards to any touchpoints about the product or service, like module drops or reminders for live elements, things like testimonial requests or feedback requests would also be included in the buyer journey.\
\
[00:02:59.330] - Stacy\
I want us to bust a couple of myths about the buyer journey. The first one I mentioned earlier, but I really want to reiterate it. Often when we think of our customer journey, it can feel like the point of purchase is like the ultimate finish line, that all paths in our business lead there. That's really not the case. Our customer journey continues beyond the point of sale. And how we craft our buyer's journey can have a huge impact on our business.\
\
[00:03:28.130] - Stacy\
Another common myth is that the customer journey is linear. So, think of like someone sees us, they opt into something, we then spend some time nurturing them, they see a checkout page, a purchase, and then we deliver the thing to them. So that linear path. But in reality, often our customer journey is way more flexible than that. People can hop in and out at different stages. People cycle through the same stage multiple times. So you can have someone who fast-tracks straight to a buyer just from seeing an Instagram post, for example. Or you could have a buyer who goes back into the nurture phase and then a few months or a year later, repurchases something else from you.\
\
[00:04:10.410] - Stacy\
So people can move through your customer journey in different ways. They could also move through it cyclically as well. There are just so many possibilities. So it's worth keeping that flexibility in mind when we are planning our customer journey and our buyer journey too because the buyer journey and the customer journey is a part of the same thing, but because of the checkouts, we can think of them as two different things. But our customer journey extends beyond that point of purchase, so the buyer journey is really part of the customer journey.\
\
[00:04:39.750] - Stacy\
Let's explore why it's worth spending time strategically planning that buyer experience. The first one is achieving your vision. When we're creating a product or service, we always have in mind like, oh people are going to really love this, or this is going to be so useful, or we're really excited to see how people interact with the product or service. Taking the time to plan your buyer journey and stepping into the role of being a good guide. By good guide, what I mean is how can we proactively anticipate our buyer's needs? But by doing that, we allow our offer and ourselves to shine. We want people to be able to interact with our product or service in the way that we envisioned.\
\
[00:05:22.550] - Stacy\
Then we want our product or service, our buyer journey, to reflect what was promised pre-sale. We don't want to be accidentally catfishing anyone. By focusing in on our buyer journey, we can help our buyers feel super supported, build that connection between us and them. In turn, that increases buyer participation and buyer engagement as well, which is all part of the vision that we would have had for that digital product or service.\
\
[00:05:52.040] - Stacy\
The second reason is future sales. The data tells us that the people most likely to buy from us are those that have an existing relationship with us. And yet we often spend a lot of our time and effort focusing on how we can find new leads. And I'm not saying that we shouldn't focus on how to find new leads. Of course, we should. Well, what I am saying is that we can spend some of that energy into nurturing our relationships with our current buyers. And by focusing on the buyer journey, it helps us to do that.\
\
[00:06:21.000] - Stacy\
And the benefits of doing so are that we can increase repeat sales from our buyers, but also we can increase referrals because people who've really enjoyed the experience of working with us are way more likely to become affiliates, give us testimonials. When people are looking for a specific expert or someone who does X thing, your name is more likely to pop up in the conversation if they have positive associations with you. So it is way more effective to spend some time on your buyer journey, continue to nurture those relationships that we have with our buyers, and long term, we will see the effects of that in our business.\
\
[00:06:59.400] - Stacy\
Then the third reason that I have here today is that it will boost your confidence, both the confidence that you have as an expert who's visible, and then also your team's confidence in delivering the program or product. So planning your buyer journey ahead of time helps you run your program or product as a well-oiled machine. It helps you field less questions. You'll get less refund requests, primarily because the experience post-purchase is matching that pre-purchase experience, like the catfishing element we touched on earlier. And you as the expert can spend less time worrying about who got access to what, and focus more on delivering your expertise. And this allows you and your team to focus on providing an excellent experience instead of worrying about the logistics.\
\
[00:07:46.590] - Stacy\
So, out of these three, which would you be most excited to achieve in your own business? Achieving the vision, increasing future sales, or building that confidence?\
\
[00:07:57.130] - Stacy\
All right, so now that I've spent some time on my soapbox talking about buyer journeys and customer experiences, let's move on to love languages.\
\
[00:08:06.360] - Stacy\
So before we dive in, I want to mention that people give and receive love differently. What I personally love is not necessarily what everyone loves. So sometimes we have to factor in other people's love languages when we're considering them. Our natural inclination does not necessarily match the person that we're planning to give some love to.\
\
[00:08:28.270] - Stacy\
The other thing I want to mention is that emotion is important. If your buyer doesn't feel anything as they navigate your buyer journey, they're less likely to engage, refer you, repeat buy in future. We want them to feel something, and what we want them to feel is excited, impressed, supported, all the good things. Then this comes back to point one again, but understanding your buyer's love languages can help you roll out to the red carpet. We want to understand what helps them feel supported, what helps them feel appreciated. That comes back to the idea that what we naturally think of as our preferred love language may not actually be theirs. It's worth investing time and effort into figuring out what's really resonating with your buyers.\
\
[00:09:16.560] - Stacy\
Why do we actually want to add love languages to the mix? What are the benefits of actually spending time actively thinking on this? The first one is Empathy. We want to step into our buyer's shoes and anticipate their needs at once. We want to do this anyway when crafting a buyer journey, but when we view it through the lens of love languages, it really helps us get into their shoes and anticipate their needs, what would make them feel good?\
\
[00:09:42.260] - Stacy\
The next one is Appreciation. We want to convey our appreciation to our buyers. They have just invested in us. We want to make sure that they feel appreciated and that they feel supported.\
\
[00:09:52.860] - Stacy\
The next one is Reputation. Love languages mix with a solid buyer journey, has that "wow factor" and it reinforces your position as an expert.\
\
[00:10:03.510] - Stacy\
Then the last one, and it's not to be cynical, but there is an element of Reciprocity. That is often returned to us by things like testimonials, referrals, or maybe even repeat purchases.\
\
[00:10:16.350] - Stacy\
It is worth our time to consider how we can use the tool of love languages to achieve these things. I keep saying love languages, but we haven't touched on what those are. Here are the five love languages. We have Gifting, Words of Affirmation, Quality Time, Acts of Service, and Touch. Do you know which of the five is your love language? It's not that we do not appreciate every love language, it's just attends that we have a preference, like a scale of 1-5. Do you know which one is your favorite and which one is your least favorite? If you're not sure, let's dive into each of these love languages and come up with some examples of how we can use them in our business and our buyer journey.\
\
[00:11:01.470] - Stacy\
All right, so first up we have Gifting, and the reason I put this first is because I think this is the one that most naturally comes to mind. So for the receiver, a gift is a visual symbol of your regard. They value the time, effort, and thought that goes into selecting a gift for them. So receiving a thoughtful gift will stand out in their memory vividly. And then for the giver, you want to plan your gift thoughtfully. What would the receiver specifically like to receive? Let's touch on how we can add gifting into our business. The first thing I want to say is that gifting is very much on a scale. There has got to be some balance between what you choose to gift and then the cost of the program or service. It has to be sustainable. It can't be financially to your detriment.\
\
[00:11:47.690] - Stacy\
Having said that, gifts don't have to be expensive and you can actually give gifts, like relatively cheap things as well. Some example of gifts in business, and I think it comes into three categories. The first is high-end gifting, the second is universal gifting, and the third is little knickknacks. So the first one, Tier One, that would be used in high-end coaching programs or one-on-one services. You want to convey appreciation that someone has invested a significant amount of money in you and your business. So, when it comes to those tier-one gifts, those really should be designed for the receiver in mind. They should be specific to that receiver, and thought and care put into, "What would that person specifically like to receive?"\
\
[00:12:33.570] - Stacy\
Now, of course, it can be a little bit tricky to figure those things out. So when we're planning our buyer journey, we should probably add things into the mix to help us figure that stuff out. Usually when we're gifting, we want it to be a surprise. So it's a bit anticlimactic to be like, "Hey, what do you like or dislike?" But there are little signs along the way, whether on their social media, whether on their onboarding call, whether on their intake form, etc, that can give us an idea as to what they would or would not appreciate as a gift.\
\
[00:13:02.290] - Stacy\
Tier Two is universal gifting, and this is usually a best fit for a program that has a largest cohort. There are too many people in the cohort to sustainably pick out a gift for each person. However, you do want to convey your appreciation. The thing I would say when it comes to gifting on this level is it should have universal appeal. It should match the vibes of your program, or you, or your brand, because that's more likely to be in alignment with what they would expect and, what they would appreciate. The final thing I will say about universal gifting is you should take into account things like allergies, whether that's through food, perfumes, or anything like that. People can be very sensitive to foods and perfumes and things. So when you are sending out a universal gift to everyone, take into account that you don't want to accidentally give someone something that they won't be able to eat or consume.\
\
[00:13:56.730] - Stacy\
Then Tier Three, which is knickknacks, that's things like little journals, pencils, pens, stickers, little things. Those are for random little appreciation. You can have a lot of fun with those. Those could be really branded to your business or things like, for example, my brand is "Workplace Lemonade." I think if I were sending out stickers and stuff, they'd probably be little lemonade bottles or yellow in general. Those little gifts would just be like specific things that are just fun, little elements of joy. It doesn't have to be hyper-specific to the receiver, but just spark a little joy upon receipt.\
\
[00:14:35.750] - Stacy\
The only thing I will say about gifting is we do think about it as a physical thing, but you can gift digitally as well. Whether that's from your own product suites or whether that's like vouchers, etc, you can do that too. You can give people access to digital products or maybe credit to your business, etc. However, for whatever reason, digital gifting just feels less personal than physical gifting. If you're aiming for that personalization, then physical gifting tends to be the better way to go.\
\
[00:15:07.000] - Stacy\
Okay, so up next we have Words of Affirmation. So, for the receiver, they enjoy kind words and encouragement. They like random messages. They appreciate being top of mind. You as a giver you can make this person's day just by complimenting them or popping in to cheer them on. So verbal or written words of encouragement or positivity, are really impactful for this type of person. So when we're using words of affirmation, there are so many different ways we can go about that. We can just pop into someone's DM's and just send them a little note. We can send them a personalized video. You can hit reply to their newsletter email, or you can send an organic email where you're just like, "Hey, I was thinking of you, blah, blah, blah." During a one-on-one call together, you can touch on things you saw them doing and that you thought were really cool. You could comment on their social media content. One, it helps drive engagement for them, but two, they're always going to appreciate the kind words. Or if they're in your group program, noting their achievements during a group call can be a way of giving them those affirming words.\
\
[00:16:12.830] - Stacy\
Now, I will say do take into account the type of person someone is. If they're more low-key or introverted, maybe those public shout-outs might not feel super comfortable to them. But, if someone is very visible publicly and loves engaging and sharing the wonderful things other people do, then yeah, pop in and do that more visibly.\
\
[00:16:33.930] - Stacy\
So, up next is Quality Time. So the receiver wants undivided attention. They appreciate when you are present and focused on them when you're together. And then for you as the giver, you want to prioritize being present, attentive, mindful. You want to make the person that you're with feel like they are your full priority, and that you are actively listening to what they are saying. So basically, for the person who loves quality time, they just want your undivided attention and they want open communication. So, in order for someone to feel like they have that, you want to first actively listen. Secondly, you want to remember the things they said. And thirdly, you want to follow up on those things at some other point. So if I mentioned something in passing weeks ago and then you bring it up later, they're like, oh my gosh, you remember that, and I'm going to feel super appreciated. So when you're on one-on-one calls or DM'ing or on a coffee date, whatever your avenues of connection are, if you're referencing those things that they've said in the past, if you're actively listening and engaging with what they are saying and they can tell they really have your attention, then they're going to feel super appreciated.\
\
[00:17:41.240] - Stacy\
The next one is Acts of Service. So, if your buyer's main love language is acts of service, they'll notice and appreciate the little extra things you do for them. Basically, they'll notice those extra mile things. And then as the giver, actions speak louder than words. So think of ways that you could support and care for your buyer. So in terms of how that can work in business, we could introduce them to a peer that we think that they would gel really well with, or maybe we could highlight them in a newsletter email or show and tell, or if your buyers work maybe reshare some of their social media posts, or refer them as a potential fit.\
\
[00:18:18.820] - Stacy\
Some of those things crossover with the idea of Words of Affirmation, of course. There is a little bit of wiggle room there. But other ways we can be of service is when we spend a little bit extra time doing something, reviewing something, giving them feedback, etc, when we're thoughtful about things like that. Those are Acts of Service and things that people who really appreciate that that extra mile will really appreciate.\
\
[00:18:43.660] - Stacy\
Finally, we have Touch. And all I'm going to say about touch is that if you're a digital business, then it's probably best to ignore this love language for now and focus your energy on the other four. So, now that we've been through all the love languages, do you know which is your love language?\
\
[00:18:59.900] - Stacy\
Now let's move on to how we can actually add love languages into our buyer journey. There's a couple of things to remember. The first is that your love language may not be the same as your buyers. We have to consider that what we naturally gravitate towards may not be what our buyers actually appreciate. You might love gifting, but maybe your buyers just really want quality time with you. It is worth remembering what you instinctively gravitate towards may not match your buyers.\
\
[00:19:29.300] - Stacy\
The second thing is it's okay to lean into your own love language to make it more sustainable long term. Using love languages in your buyer journey should feel sustainable. The easiest place to start when it comes to love languages is what comes naturally to you. It's also worth remembering that even when you're not actively planning on using love languages, they do have a habit of finding their way in there anyway. You will subconsciously add them into the mix.\
\
[00:19:57.530] - Stacy\
Then the third thing is that any use of love languages in your buyer journey should be an enhancement, not added just because. It's important to have a solid buyer journey in place before you actively add in any bells or whistles. There is really no point in spending time on sending your buyers gifts and being really attentive if the rest of the experience is super chaotic. So your love languages can't really compensate for a poor or chaotic buyer experience. So, you've got to make sure that you have the foundations in place and then sprinkle the love languages in as a way of adding more to it.\
\
[00:20:36.730] - Stacy\
So, when do we add love languages into the mix? So, earlier we spoke about the importance of planning your buyer journey, and here's a hot tip. Most buyer experiences are actually pretty mediocre. So just by having a buyer journey that's been thoughtfully planned with your buyers in mind, that's already going to set you apart. So, that being said, we want to know when we can add love languages into the mix.\
\
[00:21:01.110] - Stacy\
I would say add love languages into the mix once you have a solid buyer journey in place, one that you've thoughtfully thought out. I also just want to remind you that even if you're not actively adding love languages into your buyer journey just yet, some of those organically find their way in. So, it's not like we're not making use of them at all.\
\
[00:21:23.450] - Stacy\
So, when you are adding love languages into your buyer journey, you want to start by adding one love language at a time, just to make it sustainable. So choose one that's sustainable to you, that's balanced with the price point of your program or offer, and start with one product or service and see what the response or the workload feels like before branching out.\
\
[00:21:45.760] - Stacy\
Now that we're nearing the end of the session, let's just cast our eyes back a little bit and think about the things that we should take a look at if we want to add love languages into our buyer experience. My recommendation is that going forward, that you review your buyer journey to make sure it's as strategic as possible and that the foundations are in place. Like I said, most buyer journeys are pretty mediocre, so just by having a solid foundation in place, you're really going to stand out.\
\
[00:22:14.260] - Stacy\
Then do a self-assessment, a self-check. What are your own love languages? What do you naturally gravitate towards? Then take notes of the things that you notice that your buyers appreciate, because there may be a difference between what you naturally gravitate towards and what your buyers super-appreciate. You want to find a balance between those two things to make sure that it's sustainable long-term and that it comes semi-intuitively to you. And then you want to start trialing by actively adding one love language into the buyer journey of one product or service.\
\
[00:22:45.740] - Stacy\
And then once you've figured out okay, what's the response been like? How did this feel? Did this add anything or was this superfluous? Did people really love it or were they meh on it? Did I find it hard to deliver? Or was this really energizing? Then you could start branching out from there.\
\
[00:23:05.300] - Stacy\
And if you've been wondering how you can strategically plan your buyer journey, then I invite you to come check out your "Customer Journey Pillars and Roadmap." This is a short PDF and it goes through a couple of different things to consider when planning your buyer journey. The first is the three foundational pillars for impactful customer experiences. The second is an neglected high-impact area that you can use to increase future sales. Then the third is the five-step program delivery roadmap for smoother-than-butter delivery. So if you use this PDF, you should walk away with some insights into how you can plan your buyer journey. You can download that on workplacelemonade.com/pillars-roadmap.\
\
[00:23:50.980] - Stacy\
Let's connect. You can find me over on workplacelemonade.com, or the social media that I'm most active on is Instagram, so you'll find me over @workplace_lemonade. If you do come over to Instagram be sure to say hi, and let's chat all things love languages and buyer journey.\
\
[00:24:10.170] - Stacy\
Thank you very much for joining me in the session today. It has been a pleasure to go through the love languages and how you can mix them into your buyer journey, and let me know how you get on.\

**Transcript:**\
[00:00:00.000] - Liz Stapleton\
All right, guys. I'm super thrilled to do this session with Suzi, who's going to be talking about creating courses, which as bloggers, there's different levels of where you're at. But eventually you get to product creation and courses are a great way to go about it. Welcome, Suzi.\
\
[00:00:19.540] - Suzi Whitford\
Thank you so much, Elizabeth.\
\
[00:00:21.820] - Liz Stapleton\
We're going to just talk through it. We're going to figure out what steps they need to take. Is there some overview things they should know before we dive in?\
\
[00:00:32.150] - Suzi Whitford\
Yeah. Hi, I'm Suzi. I blog over at Start a Mom blog. And over the last three, four years, I've created about ten Signature courses and about a total of 20 to 30 products. Some of them are a little smaller of printables and so on, and that's a great way to start as well. But before we dive into that, I have been able to generate over a million dollars with my business, which is insane. And the cost of running an online business is so small. So most of it is profit. I didn't get a team or have a VA up until three years into my business. So it was a lot of bootstrapping this from the beginning. Additionally, I had kids at home. So I started my business when I was pregnant at 37 or 38 weeks of my second baby. I had baby number two, then I had baby number three. And while I was doing this, I was launching courses and growing my business. So I want to give you guys the standard operating procedure that I used to create my courses to make it simple so that I can still live my life and tend to my most important needs, like my kids and my family while still growing this business and launching amazing products.\
\
[00:01:46.150] - Liz Stapleton\
Yeah, I'm really excited because blogging can easily take over your life, especially if you're working full-time and doing it on the side still or whatnot. And the thing is, life is for living, not just for blogging. You need to get into blogging to have it take over your life. So I like that you're like, I did it so that I could maintain my life and the things that are important. So I think that's fantastic. So what made you choose courses as your product? Because obviously there's lots of different things you can do, and I said you have lots of products. And what was the benefit of that route?\
\
[00:02:19.670] - Suzi Whitford\
Well, so courses, the perceived value that students get from it is huge. Unlike a printable or a small ebook, which are great lead-ins to a course, a course is more you're learning from the person. Most of the time there's videos, there's a lot of material. You get access and you can take it at your own pace. So for students, a course is very valuable because they're building that connection with you. And many of us are used to school, right? Being taught by a professor, being taught by a teacher. So it's a natural transition to then do it as an adult, but then in the flexibility of your day. Yeah.\
\
[00:03:00.630] - Liz Stapleton\
And then how do you decide... Because I feel like this is where a lot of people get stuck and also where things can fall flat. How do you decide what to do a course on?\
\
[00:03:10.450] - Suzi Whitford\
That is a very big question. So all my students, I teach them how to start their blogs. And then eventually, when I became very successful with course creation, I started teaching that as well. And my students have done amazing with that. But the reason or what I tell them is to put in their course is the how, the detailed steps, step by step, how you would actually take somebody and hold their hand and walk them through the problem, where your blog or your website is more for the what and the why. And then your course is the exact how steps.\
\
[00:03:45.190] - Liz Stapleton\
Okay, that's a great point. So blog is what and why and course is how. So is choosing the topic the first step in the standard operating procedure, would you say, or is there like a step before that?\
\
[00:03:56.280] - Suzi Whitford\
Oh, yeah. So before you even think about course or product creation, the most important thing you can do is grow your audience, is listen to your audience, engage with them. Even if you only have 100 people on your email list, email them and ask them for feedback. Ask questions in your emails. If you don't know what to write in your weekly newsletters, just ask a question. Share something personal about yourself and ask something about them. And then as you're growing your niche, you'll start learning what their biggest struggles and problems are, and then start thinking about product creation. So your most important thing before you launch a course is to build that audience and build engagement with them. And then when you're ready to launch the course, you could survey your audience. You could do one-on-one interviews with them. You could do a Facebook Live where you're just engaging with people. Any way that you're getting feedback from them, that's going to give you ideas for your product. Yeah. And go ahead.\
\
[00:04:56.030] - Liz Stapleton\
I was going to say the more you know your audience because they won't come out directly, they don't know the solution they need. So it's more listening for the problems and think, do I have a solution for them? Because you'll be like, what do you want course on? They're like, I don't know. So don't go that route. Engage with them like you said, get to know them the more you know your audience. We did another session. We were like, be obsessed with your audience. Engage. Ask questions. They're your friends. They're your tribe. So I like that you taking that approach.\
\
[00:05:26.950] - Suzi Whitford\
Definitely. That's your bread and... That's your base of your foundation is your engagement and that relationship you build with people. They're not just like computers on the other side, there's real people, real emotions. And I love my audience because they're all moms and they're very emotional and we have all our hearts and our sleeves because our kids. So I just love it because we're just so as all people loving. But you know. So what I would suggest before you dive into creating a course is you start engaging with your audience. You learn what they need and how you can help them in that problem. Then I would suggest creating a small printable, like a small $10 product or a small ebook under $50, maybe- I'm.\
\
[00:06:07.700] - Liz Stapleton\
Going to test that area. Yeah.\
\
[00:06:10.880] - Suzi Whitford\
So create a small product first and see if they take it. See if they like it. See if they actually purchase. Kind of warm up your audience to buying from you to building that trust. And then once you see, okay, they're building or they're purchasing the small product, they're purchasing the small ebook, then you can slowly start creating that course with videos and worksheets and a ton more material in it. But before you invest two months into creating a course, start with a smaller product.\
\
[00:06:42.090] - Liz Stapleton\
Yeah. I may or may not back a year or two after I started a blog, and they have launched a course to crickets. That's okay. So back in my early days, I'm definitely familiar with that, unfortunately. And so once you got that buy in from them, literally, which that money should also help you in providing you with the resources you need to build a course because it could be a little more involved with software to do video, even if it's screen shared stuff. What does that... Do you suggest? Like a beta launch? Do you suggest how... What would the next step be? They've got the buy in, they know the topic. Where do you go from there?\
\
[00:07:26.830] - Suzi Whitford\
All right. So I have done some beta launches for my courses where I had the idea, I had a small product that was doing well, and then I beta launched a course idea. I'm going to sell this course, it's going to come out in two months, and that also puts a deadline on me. So it holds me accountable because I just told the entire audience I'm going to do this in two months. I better finish this in two months. So I beta launched a couple. I'm not a big fan of beta launching. I think it's a great strategy, but I just feel like it's so much work. If you've already tested out your idea with a small product, you've warmed up your audience, you can go ahead and start telling them that you're going to create a course. Start telling them you're going to create something a little bit better for them, a little bit more intense with more helpful tutorials. Then when you launched a course, launch it at a little bit of a discount. So that is an incentive for people to sign up that week that you launch it, add some bonuses, add a couple of different other features so that people get it for that launch week.\
\
[00:08:26.620] - Suzi Whitford\
But not the biggest... I do beta launches, but I feel like it's double the work. Like you've already did a little product, you do a beta launch and then you launch a product. And sometimes that just gets.\
\
[00:08:36.250] - Liz Stapleton\
Okay. And I did want to touch on because there's a big difference between creating the course and launching it.\
\
[00:08:42.950] - Suzi Whitford\
Oh, yeah.\
\
[00:08:43.870] - Liz Stapleton\
So do you want to dive into, okay, what action steps are you doing to create the course? And then how do you then move to the launch phase? Because those are both beasts.\
\
[00:08:55.310] - Suzi Whitford\
Yes. So there's a couple of different elements that comes before you actually launch a course. So about three or four months before I know I'm going to create a course, I would start talking to my audience about it. Just warm them up. Maybe once a month I would talk about it. And as we get closer, I would mention it in my weekly email. So number one, make sure that your audience knows that something is coming. You don't want to launch something and they're like, Oh, where did this come from? Then in the course creation process, and this is the process that I follow, this is a standard operating process that I've used to create my courses is I take that time and I start outlining it. That's the first thing I do. It might be on a notebook, might be on a piece of paper, but just start brainstorming the outline for the course. How are you going to get them from point A to point B to actually solve that problem? So that when they go through your course, they have somewhat of a transformation. Even if it's small, even if you're just helping them lose five pounds, or helping them write a little bit faster, or helping them do their first Facebook Live.\
\
[00:10:00.870] - Suzi Whitford\
One of my students is really successful. She helps moms have natural births. So instead of having Medicaid births. So that's a clear transition and transformation that the person goes through. But for a month or so, I would just brainstorm the outline. Once I have the outline done, I would write it down on a Word Doc or a Google Doc, and I would start doing the text lectures. So what text can I put into each lecture? Which lecture needs text? Which one doesn't? Sometimes I do this in Google Docs. I would start, but a lot of times I just start doing it in Teachable. That's a platform I use to create my courses just because it's already nicely organized and they're in their lectures. So outline, text lectures, then I would create any worksheets, complementary resources, any physical, technical PDFs that go along with the course or calculators or spreadsheets. Then lastly, I would record my videos because a lot of times in the videos, I'm referencing the PDFs or I'm referencing the different lectures. So you want to make sure you do the videos way last because they're also the hardest to redo and to edit and to all get done.\
\
[00:11:14.720] - Suzi Whitford\
But once I have my outline, my text lectures, my PDFs, my videos, upload it all into teachable, go through it, make sure everything looks good, and then I start creating the sales pages.\
\
[00:11:26.130] - Liz Stapleton\
Okay. And we do have some sessions on sales page creation for sure. So you are using teachable. What are you using, though, to create all that? You mentioned Google Docs, but what are you using to shoot your videos, to edit them? Because sometimes videos are... You're facing the camera, sometimes it's the screen. What tools are you using and what made you decide to go with those ones?\
\
[00:11:53.920] - Suzi Whitford\
Sure, definitely. So hardware, I use a ring light. You don't have to. One of my courses, I sat in front of a nice lit window with my cell phone. So you can start off like- You can bootstrap. Right, you can bootstrap. That was perfectly fine. Right now I have a ring light, a webcam, and the microphone, but that's pretty much it. Then for software, I was between Screencastomatic and Camtasia. Camtasia is around $300 a year or $300 for the entire license, but it's pretty pricey, where Screencastomatic is $15 per year. It's fantastic. You can do the screen sharing. You can do full face on the video. It's very easy to edit it. Camtasia has a little bit more capabilities of doing fancy overlays and making it look more fancy. But you know what? People are enrolling on your course not for how fancy your things look, but to get the transformation. So Screencastomatic does 80 % of what you need. Also, what's a perk about Screencastomatic is when you are done editing it, you can watch it on two times speed and then edit it that way and cut out any silences or any places you mess up, where in Camtasia, you have to watch it at the same speed that you spoke, and that takes twice as long.\
\
[00:13:16.860] - Suzi Whitford\
Got you.\
\
[00:13:17.410] - Liz Stapleton\
No, that's a great point. I don't use either of those. I use something else, but I like it. But I'm also like, well, I know how to use the one I use. Which one do you use? I use Screenflow. Oh, cool. I think I've heard of it. It's a similar idea of ScreenTests, but it's like... So I bought it years ago and it's a one time cost. You can always upgrade when they come up with a new one and pay for the upgrade. I've just been using the one I paid for. I think it was like a hundred bucks, so it's not cheap, but it's not yearly either. Right. You know, everything has its pros and cons. But yeah, because I think it's always important to understand course creation. Typically you can bootstrap it pretty cheaply, but you've got to be aware there is going to be some cost to that. And then teachable, I would assume, hosts your videos.\
\
[00:14:05.120] - Suzi Whitford\
Yes. So teachable, there's different ways that you can actually create your courses and then lock down the membership and accept payments. So you can do it all on your WordPress website with a couple of different tools connected together. There's programs like Thinkific, Teachable, Kajabi. There's all-in-one solutions like ClickFunnels or Kartra. So there's a lot of platforms. You just decide on the right one for you and try not to overcomplicate it. So teachable works for me.\
\
[00:14:36.450] - Liz Stapleton\
Yeah, I use Podia, but I remember teachable and it was Fedora. I've used them in the past too. They've built a really great platform. So it's whatever's going to work best for you and everyone's a little different. I like to think of it as like Apple versus the Android, right? They're both great, but some people just gravitate to one or the other.\
\
[00:14:55.030] - Suzi Whitford\
Exactly. Yeah.\
\
[00:14:57.090] - Liz Stapleton\
Okay. So then once you've built your course and you got your sales page, which we won't dig too much into that unless there's some points you really want to make because we do have sessions on sales page. Yeah, that's fine. What is the launch look like?\
\
[00:15:12.020] - Suzi Whitford\
All right. So depending on how pricey the course is. So if it's something that's like $20 or less, you don't have to push that much. It's an easy sell. You can probably write a couple of emails, maybe do one live. That's good. If it's something like $100 close to that range and depending on how price sensitive your audience is. So $100 for my audience is a lot of money. So that would be a legit launch for me. I would email my list a couple of times about it. I would warm them up the months before. I would also have a very segmented part of my list that I know they're interested in the course. So yes, my entire list would hear about it, but that smaller segment of my list would hear more about it. So a recent launch I did was my entire list is at that time was around 40,000, and the smaller part of the list was 700 people. So a very small percentage of that. But with that 700 people, I think I made over $70,000 a month for total. So even though it was a small list or a small segment.\
\
[00:16:20.400] - Suzi Whitford\
So during launch week, I would have my two lists that I would talk to. I would write multiple emails. I would do multiple Facebook Lives so that people can see me and see me sell the product. I've never been really good at webinars where people know they're signing up and they're about to get sold. I just clam up and I just am not really good at that. I know it's a great strategy. It just doesn't work for me. So I do Facebook Lives where I'm much more casual and relaxed, and I can tell people about my.\
\
[00:16:51.200] - Liz Stapleton\
Product-you're audience-talking because you're like that, right? People that are your people are going to get it, and I'll be fine.\
\
[00:16:58.140] - Suzi Whitford\
They're going to be like, What's this webinar? Suzi doesn't do webinars. I do Facebook Lives so people can ask me questions. I have expiring bonuses during my first week that I launched it. I definitely have a price increase during that first week, and I would recommend doing a launch. What works for me is from Monday to Friday. I once did a launch, I think it was from Wednesday to Sunday. And once the weekend hit, I could just feel the engagement drop because my audience are moms and they're busy with their families. And ending my launch on a Sunday was a bad idea. So for future references, think about your audience. Are they... Maybe they're at their corporate jobs all week and on the weekends they're freer. So maybe that's good for you. For mine, my audience is a little bit more in structure during the week, and on the weekends it's like family. So for me, my future launches will be from Monday to Fridays, and those do much better for me.\
\
[00:17:54.370] - Liz Stapleton\
Okay. Yeah. And then so I want to ask because you mentioned a launch week. So do youhow do you decide... Okay, a couple of questions in one, I guess. Because launch week, does it become unavailable after that? Do you do Evergreen? What dictates that launch week?\
\
[00:18:13.030] - Suzi Whitford\
So launch week is the first time it's open for sale ever, and it starts off with a little bit of a discount. So people who trust me, who like me, who don't take a chance, but are invested early.\
\
[00:18:27.980] - Liz Stapleton\
They get the-I have people that are like, Oh, you can... Something new. Here's my money. Let me have that.\
\
[00:18:32.180] - Suzi Whitford\
They already know you. They know they're going to get a little bit of incentive. So launch week is... Yeah, it's awesome. It's a little bit of a discount. But then after that, it's open and people can enroll when they want to. I might run sales throughout the year, but never as low as what launch week was. Launch week is always the lowest that I ever offered.\
\
[00:18:55.870] - Liz Stapleton\
Okay. And then what you mentioned, bonuses also during launch week. What bonuses do you typically do or recommend or suggest to go with your launch?\
\
[00:19:06.350] - Suzi Whitford\
Yeah, it's a great question. Anything that makes them get to that transformation faster. So the course probably that you're creating already has tons of videos, and that takes time. So bonuses work really well if it helps you get through that content faster. So maybe like a cheat sheet that goes with the course, maybe some done-for-you templates. There is a big bundle that's sold every year called ultimate bundles, and it's 65 courses and it's insane and it's so much content. But the bonus that they have that goes really well with it or like a to upsell, is the cheat sheets for each course. So if you can create some way where people can go through your course, but at a faster pace like Cliff notes, those work really well as bonuses.\
\
[00:19:57.350] - Liz Stapleton\
Swipe, copy, things like that. Okay. Yeah. And then because another thing blogger space is time. So you've created the course and then where do you fit in creating bonuses? How does that balance? Or where do you squeeze that in? Do you need to be ready at launch day or can you be like by the end of launch or by the end of next week they'll be ready or something?\
\
[00:20:21.530] - Suzi Whitford\
Normally if they're PDFs, they're a file, I would have those already done because I'm more excited about them. You could also if you run out of time and you don't have a bonus to offer, you could offer a future bonus, like get on a coaching call with me, like a group coaching call, or everybody who is on who gets it during launch week gets something special that you promised in the future, but it's more personal with you, engagement, if you don't have that PDF.\
\
[00:20:50.330] - Liz Stapleton\
Right now. Okay. Yeah, group coaching videos one on one time or something like that.\
\
[00:20:56.910] - Suzi Whitford\
I'll review your course or I'll help you with your process, or let me look at your birth story or your birth plan and we'll talk about it if you're selling a birth course.\
\
[00:21:07.240] - Liz Stapleton\
Sure. So you say the launch is always the lowest price, but how much lower is it from what the final price is going to be usually as a percentage? Is it just depends on the course?\
\
[00:21:18.310] - Suzi Whitford\
Like around 40 %.\
\
[00:21:20.610] - Liz Stapleton\
40 % cheaper than the launch? Yeah. Okay.\
\
[00:21:22.880] - Suzi Whitford\
That would be the highest I would go. And then because sales throughout the year, I can go as low as like 30 % off my products.\
\
[00:21:31.740] - Liz Stapleton\
Okay. Yeah, that makes sense. Okay, so 40 % cheaper. And then you said you'd always do a price increase during launch. Is that in between the final price and the lowest?\
\
[00:21:42.160] - Suzi Whitford\
So I've done some crazy launches where the first 100 people got it for one price and then the rest of the launch was at another price. And then at the end of the launch, it was a big price.\
\
[00:21:52.470] - Liz Stapleton\
That was fun.\
\
[00:21:53.770] - Suzi Whitford\
Yeah, that was really fun to do that. But if it's your first launch, don't try to overcomplicate it with different tiers of pricing. Just have your launch price and then your full price.\
\
[00:22:04.890] - Liz Stapleton\
Okay. Yeah. If you want to throw another one in there rather than getting complicated with a bump sale, which I think is what it's called, you can always be like, three days later, hey, guys, it's going up to something like 20 % off or something or whatever before you get to that final price. But just make it a date as opposed to a number of purchasers.\
\
[00:22:21.470] - Suzi Whitford\
Yeah, it was crazy. So I built up all this excitement for the course. And then I said the first 100 people would get at this price, and it was gone like 10 minutes.\
\
[00:22:31.580] - Liz Stapleton\
I.\
\
[00:22:31.840] - Suzi Whitford\
Had to sit there and refresh, refresh, refresh, and like, Okay, coupon code expires. Done. We're gone. And people were asking. It was a lot of fun. Yeah.\
\
[00:22:40.920] - Liz Stapleton\
And that's a great way to drive scarcity and get people to take action, which is one method of getting them to purchase the course. There's a lot of that psychology and various things you could do. But one thing I did want to touch on is I feel like a lot of people face mindset issues when it comes to creating a course. And this is just sometimes a fear of failure, but it's also sometimes a fear of success. So you have a lot of students that you've helped launch courses. What are some of the struggles they've had? And maybe things people should be aware of so they can overcome them?\
\
[00:23:17.650] - Suzi Whitford\
I think the biggest struggle is sending that first email and asking people to buy something from you. It's very scary. So that's why I highly suggest to my students who have those mindset issues to start with something small. Start with small e-book, small printable, maybe a small mini course if you are willing to go ahead and pay for the nice software to host that. But if you don't want to pay for teachable or think of it or whatnot, you can start with a small e-book. But that helps build your confidence. So if you can sell a five-dollar e-book and some people are getting engagement and you like it and they're giving you good reviews, then you can sell a $15 e-book plus workbook or e-book plus printable, and then it can slowly progress from there. But I think it's just like starting a little smaller and building your confidence that way instead of thinking, Okay, I only have 100 people on my email list. I want to create a course on this. I've never sold a product before. I don't know how to do funnels or sales pages or launch. So just start smaller and build your confidence there.\
\
[00:24:19.740] - Suzi Whitford\
Okay.\
\
[00:24:21.000] - Liz Stapleton\
So obviously there are some that because of various mindset issues, they never take action or they never get to the point of launching. Any suggestions on how they can break through that to take the action to do the things? I mean, they're on the summit, which is great.\
\
[00:24:40.290] - Suzi Whitford\
It's a.\
\
[00:24:40.690] - Liz Stapleton\
Good first step, but what else should they do?\
\
[00:24:45.190] - Suzi Whitford\
Golly, just think about what's the worst that's going to happen. So you email your list, you created a small ebook, nobody buys. You're like, okay, well, maybe I'll do a little something different. Maybe I'll start with a printable. Maybe I'll just focus on affiliate marketing. Maybe I'll continue growing my email list. But nothing bad is going to happen. There's no lion that's going to eat us. We get stronger if we go through these failures. There's lots of times that I have- You.\
\
[00:25:13.010] - Liz Stapleton\
Learn a lot more from failing than succeeding\
\
[00:25:14.450] - Suzi Whitford\
yeah, and I know it's scary, but it's okay. We all are afraid. Like, even people who've done this for a long time. I recently launched something last week that was around $15, and I'm like, I wonder if somebody's going to buy it. I wonder if they like it. I hope they like it. And I'm like, if they don't like it, then nobody will buy it, or then I'll just create something better. But yeah, there's a lot of things that I've done that have failed, and it's okay. And the.\
\
[00:25:44.060] - Liz Stapleton\
Thing is, one of the great things when you've done it a long time, so I've been working for over five years, is when you work on something, then you're like, Wait, I think I have something that could go along with this, and it could be a bonus later on. When you get to bigger stuff or whatever, and you're like, Oh, wait, I don't have to create something brand new. I already created this. It's just my audience wasn't very big then no one bought it and dropped it. Bring it back. They may be totally into it now.\
\
[00:26:08.940] - Suzi Whitford\
That's a good point.\
\
[00:26:10.130] - Liz Stapleton\
So you can always reuse it for something. You could create content out of that ebook instead. If you're short on blog post, be like, let me take a picture, whatever. So worst that happens is that no one buys, but then you still create a piece content or something that you can totally use later on.\
\
[00:26:27.540] - Suzi Whitford\
Super smart.\
\
[00:26:28.400] - Liz Stapleton\
So just always something to keep in mind.\
\
[00:26:31.510] - Suzi Whitford\
I like that.\
\
[00:26:32.950] - Liz Stapleton\
Yeah, because-.\
\
[00:26:34.880] - Suzi Whitford\
You have to be stubbornly positive as an entrepreneur.\
\
[00:26:38.370] - Liz Stapleton\
I.\
\
[00:26:39.070] - Suzi Whitford\
Know we all get our negative days and we get down the dooms and we're like, I'm not good enough. But sometimes you just have to be like, you know what? I'm stubbornly positive today. I'm going to be happy. I'm going to figure this out. It's okay. Yeah.\
\
[00:26:50.830] - Liz Stapleton\
And recognizing that that nervousness doesn't go away. Like you said, you were nervous last week. I launched a preview with an upsell last week, and I made the first sale in a day or two or whatever, which I haven't started marking it yet. And I was like, that's my favorite, $39 I've earned or whatever. Just because I was like, oh, my new thing apparently it's working, right? Yeah. No, I totally hear you. And I'm nowhere in the League of you, but it's always exciting wherever you are, what level, how much you earn, stuff like that. That good feeling doesn't go away either.\
\
[00:27:28.610] - Suzi Whitford\
Right. I remember my first sale, the first ebook I sold was I created something and I sold it. I don't know how... I can't remember. I think I emailed my list about it on a Saturday night where all moms are busy on Saturday. They're busy with their kids. But anyway, I woke up Sunday morning and I had one sale. I had a sale at $17. It was so exciting. And then from there just slowly started to grow. But every little sale I remember. -yeah. I made a video for the first 100 people who bought my e-book. I made a video and I read their names, and I thanked each one. I put it on Facebook. I think it was a live. Yeah, I should probably do that again. It would probably just take a little longer now to read through all the names.\
\
[00:28:17.250] - Liz Stapleton\
Yeah, just depends. But no, that's exciting. Yeah, because the more you make them feel special. You just create a whole bubble of awesome.\
\
[00:28:25.290] - Suzi Whitford\
Oh, that's awesome. Yeah.\
\
[00:28:27.490] - Liz Stapleton\
Just came up with it. I love it. And I'll have to.\
\
[00:28:30.570] - Suzi Whitford\
Use that again. Can we put that as the title of this talk?\
\
[00:28:33.450] - Liz Stapleton\
Bubble of awesome. We'll put it in the description. Okay. That will be fine. You can maybe hashtag anything you guys want to say with this.\
\
[00:28:44.950] - Suzi Whitford\
Bubble of awesome. Yes, bubble of awesome.\
\
[00:28:48.760] - Liz Stapleton\
All right. So have we missed any steps when it comes to creating and then selling an online course? Is there anything that makes it go by faster? Because you talked about taking a good few months. You can probably create that first product quickly. But anything, any final tips or steps?\
\
[00:29:10.930] - Suzi Whitford\
Collie, so yeah, the longest thing that takes me in course creation is the outlining. And that could take you a couple of days if you know exactly know the steps from point A to point B. I just always take a little bit longer because I want to make sure they're in the right flow and then I'm covering everything. And it's not like I'm sitting down every day for two hours thinking about the outline. It's like as I'm cooking dinner or as I'm in the shower or as I'm driving, I'm like, Oh, yeah, I should add that, and I just jot it down. So the brainstorming phase takes me a little longer just because I like to do that process. But then the actual course creation phase is I would take like two weeks and be like, this is my two weeks. I'm going to spend these two weeks creating courses. I might have some people guest post on my blog, so I don't have to worry about writing content. I might already pre-schedule some newsletters, so I don't have to email people. I can just focus on course creation. You can also let your audience know, hey, I might be a little bit quieter because I'm focusing on this.\
\
[00:30:08.990] - Suzi Whitford\
Then take two weeks, do the outline, write the lectures, create the printables, and then take one or two days to do all your videos because it takes a long time, especially if kids or you have a busy life to organize to have four or five hours of quiet and to do your hair, to do your makeup to look good, to have to be in a good mindset to do those videos.\
\
[00:30:28.590] - Liz Stapleton\
I'm trying to get my makeup for these videos, and I'm like, Don't be worried. Can't wait to come here. I'm not going to be able to be able to be able to be able to come.\
\
[00:30:36.370] - Suzi Whitford\
I would take one or two days to do all the video shooting and then edit them and then put them all into your course creation platform, and then just set up a part of that two weeks to get it all done. And then after that, start launching. Don't be afraid to launch because a lot of times you run into creating this awesome product, and then you're like, Okay, I'm not going to tell anybody about it. Now I'm going to be really quiet and like... So don't be afraid. I know you put a lot of effort into creating your product. You still need to save a little bit of effort to actually launch it too.\
\
[00:31:09.400] - Liz Stapleton\
Yes, for sure.\
\
[00:31:11.610] - Suzi Whitford\
Very.\
\
[00:31:14.980] - Liz Stapleton\
Few people in my experience ask for refund. They may be like, Hey, I didn't quite understand this. You're like, Oh, I can add to that. The beauty of blogging and digital products is you can always tweak them later and add more if you find that a step is missing or that people keep getting tripped up somewhere. And having people in there is going to help you identify those.\
\
[00:31:33.260] - Suzi Whitford\
Exactly.\
\
[00:31:33.820] - Liz Stapleton\
You can't do that unless they buy, so you got to speak up.\
\
[00:31:38.800] - Suzi Whitford\
Very true.\
\
[00:31:39.540] - Liz Stapleton\
To make your best product, you got to get people to buy. And then the other thing I was going to note is, when you're brainstorming, you can always bounce ideas. It's always great to have a group of blogging friends. Guys, what do you think? In a Mastermind last month, friend who's been doing a course forever, and I told her just do it. She showed us her outline and we're like, well, we think you should rearrange it this way. Because what she's teaching is an art expertise. So we're like, we'd understand it better, which is how she thinks differently. So it's just having someone you can bounce an idea off of maybe besides your audience can help you to clearly read that outline.\
\
[00:32:21.060] - Suzi Whitford\
Definitely. I agree. I bounce most of my stuff off of my husband, but not everybody has that same very techy husband that sits next to you and does your WordPress updates for you. A lot of us have family.\
\
[00:32:32.830] - Liz Stapleton\
That like, I've been doing this five years and they still don't know what I do.\
\
[00:32:36.930] - Suzi Whitford\
Okay, you're just in front of a computer. I'm like, Yep, I'm a YouTuber. Sometimes when I just say I'm a YouTuber or an influencer, they start understanding a.\
\
[00:32:45.860] - Liz Stapleton\
Little bit more. Back when I did freelance writing, I know anymore, but I'd just be like, I'm a freelancer because they could understand that. That's okay. Yeah. Well, that's great. Thank you so much. I think that gives people a lot of action steps that they can take, which is fantastic.\
\
[00:33:02.140] - Liz Stapleton\
But you do have a course course by numbers. Do you want to share with them what that is, where they can get it?\
\
[00:33:10.310] - Suzi Whitford\
Yeah. So you could just go to... Thank you. You can go to coursebynumber. Com and see the success stories of my students who have gone through course by number, making up to 20,000 a month with a birthing course or a parenting course or a Finnish language course. So there's different niches that can do really well. It's all about building that engaged audience and then launching an awesome product. Also in Course by Number, I don't just cover how to create the course and launch it. I also show you how to build that Evergreen funnel so that maybe you are not really big into doing this big launch, but you just want to sell it automatically on your blog and funnel people into it. I show you how to do that too.\
\
[00:33:52.940] - Liz Stapleton\
Yes. And the link is actually below the video. So it's on this page, you guys can go click on it. And then I think if you end up getting the All Access Pass, there's a discount for that course included exclusively for the All Access pass too. So definitely if you like this video, want to rewatch it, get the All Access pass and you'll get the discount to see these course too.\
\
[00:34:13.620] - Suzi Whitford\
Awesome. That's a good incentive. Yes.\
\
[00:34:17.280] - Liz Stapleton\
And depending on when you buy the All Access pass too, the discount may be the value of the All Access pass. I don't quite remember. But thank you, Suzi. Any final words? I appreciate the time. Anything else? Lastly...\
\
[00:34:34.340] - Suzi Whitford\
No, thank you guys so much for being here. Thank you for watching. If you have any questions for me, I'm Suzi, S-U-Z-I@startamomblog.Com.\
\
[00:34:42.900] - Liz Stapleton\
All right. Thank you so much, guys. We'll see you at the end of the session.\

**Transcript:**\
[00:00:10.150] - Liz Stapleton, Summit Host\
All right, guys, I'm super excited for today's session with Tracie Fobes, who previously owned Penny Pinchin Mom, super successful blog, sold it in 2019 and now really focuses on helping bloggers succeed. Tracie, thank you so much and welcome.\
\
[00:00:24.070] - Tracie Fobes, traciefobes.com\
Thanks for having me. I'm really excited to be here today and talk about one of my favorite topics.\
\
[00:00:28.660] - Liz\
Yeah. Because so I'm in a ton of Facebook groups actually have a couple, but I'm not super good at them, so I'm really excited for your topic. So do you just want to kind of give us a quick overview of some of the things we're going to cover today?\
\
[00:00:41.920] - Tracie\
Absolutely. So everybody seems to say Facebook is dead and nobody should be on Facebook. Well, I tend to disagree with that. Facebook can still be a very powerful platform, but you have to know how to use it. Long gone are the days where you would put something on your Facebook page and everybody would see it. Now, Facebook has shifted to where your page is really kind of your calling card, it's kind of that, "welcome. Here's a little bit about me."\
\
[00:01:08.470] - Tracie\
The magic that happens when Facebook takes place within your groups. And that's where we see growth and income and some amazing things happening. So I think every single person who's out there that has any sort of an online presence really needs to consider having a Facebook group. We'll talk about how we get started and a couple of tricks to maybe get it to grow. And what in the world do you do in a Facebook group?\
\
[00:01:34.600] - Liz\
Awesome. And I am just going to throw in that there is a Facebook group for the Summit, so you should join that.\
\
[00:01:40.570] - Liz\
And I'll be taking some of Tracie's tips to, like, make it even better. OK, so because it is different in running a Facebook group as opposed to being in some elses and participating, and different rules and stuff. So what are some sort of dos and don'ts of running your own Facebook group?\
\
[00:01:57.640] - Tracie\
So you really want to make sure that you decide if it's going to be an open group or a closed group. So an open group is one... Anybody can come in, they can join, they can leave as they want. You have no control over who's there, who's not.\
\
[00:02:11.080] - Tracie\
I don't recommend that kind of group.\
\
[00:02:12.700] - Tracie\
OK, but the closed group is where they answer questions. And I'm sure you've all probably joined those groups and they're asking these questions and all these different things. And you're thinking, how did they do that? They did a closed group.\
\
[00:02:24.700] - Tracie\
So the closed group just allows you to have a little more control. It can let you know the people that maybe joined Facebook last week. You know, though, people who maybe are less than savory that you want to have in your group, you're not sure about their intentions.\
\
[00:02:38.980] - Tracie\
So that's probably one of my biggest things, is just to know who's coming in and to kind of control that. One other thing I really love about the Facebook group, one of my favorite tricks is that your questions, you can say, would you like to be on my email list? If so, drop your email address right here. So while they are joining your group, you also have this amazing opportunity to collect and add that person directly to your email list.\
\
[00:03:08.860] - Tracie\
So it gives you a double opportunity where, great, if they don't want to maybe partake in my group very much, maybe they're not active, they'll at least see all my emails. So it's a double win situation. So that's probably one of my favorite things about running a group.\
\
[00:03:23.470] - Tracie\
Now, the other thing we have to remember as an administrator is people aren't just going to come in and just start talking. When you're in those groups where everybody's talking, everybody's engaging. That didn't happen by magic.\
\
[00:03:34.480] - Tracie\
The administrator. You're going to have to get in there. You're going to feel like you are talking to nobody, talking to your four year old who's watching Paw Patrol and not listening to you. Right. It's going to be that same feeling that there's crickets going on. But we use engagement techniques. We don't just post a link to our latest blog post. We ask engaging in questions. One of my favorites is you put up something fun because let's face it, we all need to escape what's going on in the world around us.\
\
[00:04:05.530] - Tracie\
Right? We just need to just enjoy life once in a while. So are you Team apple or banana? Something that simple can get people engaged. Then you start asking questions, not open ended, like, what are you doing this weekend? No, what are you doing this weekend? Answer with Gif and then they will put a Gif in there and everybody can get engaged and it makes them start feeling like they were a part of your community.\
\
[00:04:31.990] - Tracie\
So those are a couple of things that I like to recommend to my administrators of Facebook groups.\
\
[00:04:37.090] - Liz\
Yeah, no, I. I love responding with Gifs or however you say it.\
\
[00:04:42.070] - Tracie\
I don't know how you say it either.\
\
[00:04:42.790] - Liz\
I suck at using emojis. Give me a Gif any day.\
\
[00:04:47.260] - Tracie\
Exactly. Exactly. I'm the same way. It's like and people love to do that because there's so many funny ones. And I honestly love it too, because I see some of the funniest ones I've never seen before and like, oh my gosh, where did you find that one? And I'm just dying laughing.\
\
[00:05:02.350] - Tracie\
So, you know, as an administrator, we have to make our people feel welcome.\
\
[00:05:08.810] - Tracie\
And we have to make them, give them a reason to be there, it's not just, oh, come into my group because we're going to have great recipes, alright recipes, schmecipes. You know, that's boring, right? There has to be something happening there that makes them want to join, that makes them want to be able to show up every day and like log into Facebook and the first place they go is your group.\
\
[00:05:31.070] - Liz\
Yeah. So I love those suggestions of, like, what the administrator can post. Do you have any tips on how to get other people to start conversations themselves? I mean, you are going to feel like you're talking to a wall for a bit, but when does that tide shift and do group rules play into that? What?\
\
[00:05:49.170] - Tracie\
Yeah. And so, yeah, it could take a little time. The group rules are a big part. And so within your rules, you might not allow links, you might have certain things they can or cannot do.\
\
[00:05:59.420] - Tracie\
But what you can do is.... You can, when you start asking those questions and I will do that a lot of times, so it's like, OK, because I run a blogging group, but you can kind of shift this same idea to any group you're running. So let's say you run a photography group and it's all about how to take better pictures on your iPhone. And so you can say, OK, what is your... The one thing you hate about, you know, your pictures or are your pictures blurry or you finding that you can never take a selfie the right way?\
\
[00:06:31.610] - Tracie\
You know, you can have people to ask those types of questions and they can start asking and then you respond. And then when you start responding, people see that, oh, my gosh, this person is going to show up. They're going to answer my questions... So you can do that.\
\
[00:06:47.390] - Tracie\
Another really cool trick is when you have new members come in. Facebook has this incredible feature that they've built into every group. And you can send a welcome message because you've seen those where they welcome all their new members and they tag everybody.\
\
[00:07:02.410] - Tracie\
You're like, how in the world do they do that? Well they didn't sit down and research it themselves. Let me tell you that, there is a little button you can click, that says "welcome your new members" when you welcome them in, they instantly feel like, oh, I get to be here, ask them to tell a little bit about themselves or why are they in your group? Get them to try to engage from the get go and they'll be more likely to ask those questions and engage within your community going forward because they don't feel like they joined the space, that nobody cares if they're there.\
\
[00:07:33.590] - Tracie\
They want you to care that they took the time to show up. So that's on our shoulders to make them feel like they are a part of our community and give them that reason again to come in every day, ask their questions and want to help others.\
\
[00:07:50.420] - Liz\
OK, yeah. No, and I, I do like you. I did start doing that with the Summit last year with Facebook group. And again it was like the first time I'd really run a Facebook group in years. But I do kind of want to go back to the rules because we've all been part of those groups where they're just junk, like they're junk. And you don't want that to happen. Like you're trying to cultivate a strong community, which is where all the other good stuff comes from.\
\
[00:08:16.020] - Liz\
So what are some good ground rules to set or to think about and maybe even some better some other questions besides for email address that might help set the tone?\
\
[00:08:26.180] - Tracie\
Oh, great question. So one thing that's really awesome is that Facebook has set rules that you can just literally say, I want to show Facebook rules, but some of them are: you have to have respect for everybody. You cannot use profanity, those types of things, which are kind of a given.\
\
[00:08:44.330] - Tracie\
But some of them I like to add in there is that we don't allow for self promotion because you'll have those people who come in and all they do is self promote.\
\
[00:08:51.900] - Tracie\
Oh, my gosh, it's horrible they come and all they want to do is share their link everywhere and they start spamming like crazy. So you can have some rules about link sharing or sharing your own links and how that works. You can also put rules about maybe you want to allow people to share links, but you don't want them to use their own referral or affiliate links. You can have that kind of a stipulation in there to where we are allowed to help answer questions.\
\
[00:09:15.230] - Tracie\
But you cannot share your own affiliate link. Other things that I will do is why do you want to be in my group?\
\
[00:09:22.950] - Tracie\
And I have a multiple-choice on mine, and it helps me weed it out because my questions, I have people who come in and they answer all four questions like I want to be in for all four of these reasons. Well, you're not coming in because you're a brand new blogger and you don't know what you're doing and you've been blogging for years and want to help those two things do not go together. So when someone answers all four of those, I instantly know you're not here for the right reason. So you can do that.\
\
[00:09:48.450] - Tracie\
Another thing that you can do is, where did you hear about me? And so you can use that, a great opportunity that you could put in there- is are you here because of my free course? If not, and you can tell them where your course is at and have an answer, a yes or no, so you can actually advertise something else that's outside of Facebook to maybe say, oh, you have a free course. That's really cool. So, no, I'm not here because that but I'm going to go find it now so you can use that as well.\
\
[00:10:19.380] - Tracie\
But you set these rules in place because the rules help you control the group and it gives you that instant way to remove somebody if they do something you don't like. So I have people who come in all the time and the very first post they make is they post a link to their site. You get zero...\
\
[00:10:39.180] - Liz\
Zero tolerance.\
\
[00:10:40.350] - Tracie\
That's it. You did it the first time. You literally just agreed to my terms. That said, you will not post a link and the very first thing you did was post a link.So guess what? Bye bye. You're gone.\
\
[00:10:50.580] - Tracie\
So it, it really gives you that opportunity to do that. One other thing that's really great for administrators is if you do have to remove somebody's content, you can go in Facebook will give you, what, like a little box that says, why are you removing this? And you can toggle whichever rule they violated and you can even share that rule with the person. So they know you took this down because it was self promotional or you we took this down because it was being confrontational or it was being rude and it just is kind of their warning.\
\
[00:11:24.480] - Liz\
Yeah.\
\
[00:11:24.990] - Tracie\
And that way then it just kind of gives you a little more control. But those are some of the rules. I put in...\
\
[00:11:29.850] - Liz\
I feel like you would use that for someone who has been in your group while has engaged, has been a good community member. They just made a mistake. Right. Like, you know, but the people that come in, just dropping links... Like I...so, one thing I see with a lot of people is they don't want people to not like them. And so they hesitate, they don't want to kick anyone out. They're like I'm trying to grow this. Why would I kick people out? Kick people out. Don't feel bad about it. It is your space. Control it. So I just wanted to add that.\
\
[00:12:00.090] - Tracie\
Yeah, it's kind of like a business. If you were out to dinner somewhere and there was somebody in the table next to you and they were being belligerent would the owner, let them just stay there because they don't want to lose that customer, or would they go and tell them they had to leave? Chances are they would tell that one person to leave so as to not to upset the other 50 people in the room, it's the same thing with your group.\
\
[00:12:20.940] - Tracie\
You can't try to appease one person and potentially alienate hundreds or thousands of others. So you don't owe them anything, literally not a thing. They don't like it. That's their fault. They violated your rules. I am not here to make friends. I'm running a business. And while I try to blend the two, there are times where I do have to separate them and put on my business hat and say, you know what, this isn't personal. It's business.\
\
[00:12:48.090] - Liz\
Yes, yes. No, I like that. I just want to touch on that.\
\
[00:12:52.530] - Tracie\
Oh yeah. No, it's a great point to bring up for sure.\
\
[00:12:56.010] - Liz\
OK, so we talked about engaging and setting rules. At what point, how long, how long does it tend to take for things to kind of start to take off? If you're being consistent, if you're showing up, what, how, what kind of is a you can you expect?\
\
[00:13:13.440] - Tracie\
So I see it seems that once you hit this, seven hundred to a thousand members in your group is where things start to happen.\
\
[00:13:23.760] - Tracie\
So up until that time, it could be crickets and it could be just you. But you still need to show up every single day. You still need to engage people. You need to make sure that you are getting more people to join your group, that you're not just saying, OK, well, no one's there talking. I'm just it was a bust. Give it time, because people aren't just going to come in there, start talking.\
\
[00:13:48.720] - Tracie\
But that's what it seems like. I'm starting I've watched groups and that kind of seems to be that magic number. When we start getting that many members, then there's enough people in there where someone's not afraid to ask a question. And that's all it takes. It takes one person being willing to come in and ask something and that gets other people talking. Now, one tool or trick you can use for this is you can use your family and friends.\
\
[00:14:17.100] - Tracie\
So you could ask them, could you go in and start asking questions and things. And that can maybe encourage other people to start to do the same, so don't be afraid to ask them to do you a favor.\
\
[00:14:28.060] - Liz\
Yeah, no, I like that. I do want to ask so we want to show up, but I definitely see Facebook groups where you can tell it's automated. And so every Monday they post the thing of like motivation Monday, you know, and every Tuesday this and every Wednesday it's this...\
\
[00:14:45.160] - Liz\
And there's something nice about that in some ways. But it's like. I kind of a lot of times I ignore them because it's like they're not really engaging with me.\
\
[00:14:54.990] - Tracie\
Right, it's not genuine. You know, it's like these these groups where it's like you said, it's like it's like motivation Monday, you know, what are we going to do this week? That's not real because you're not showing up and asking that. And people can tell. And the other way they can tell is just, again, if you're seeing the same thing every Monday or they can see where it's coming from, if you're using an external app, it'll say, posted by MeetEdgar or whatever, and that's like a dead giveaway, that that's what you're doing.\
\
[00:15:22.890] - Tracie\
So I understand the premise of that. But I have never used those because I just feel that they're not engaging enough. And in most cases, let's say it's you're in a Facebook group where you can share your latest blog post. That's what they allow is on Tuesdays. It's a self promotional day. For what? Nobody clicks on. It is like everybody just drops their link and runs. Think about what you're doing. Are you dropping your link and helping other people look?\
\
[00:15:51.420] - Tracie\
Are you engaging with others? Because in most cases they're not. And so it's just kind of a... Of link farm for lack of a better description. And it's not\
\
[00:16:01.440] - Liz\
I like that description, actually.\
\
[00:16:03.660] - Tracie\
It's not really doing anything for you. It's just. Just like it doesn't help, it just it doesn't at all. Another one of those I hate with every ounce of my being is share your Facebook group and follow at least five others. The problem with that is we should only follow the pages we want to engage with. Just following random pages just because you want to get more people on yours doesn't help anybody because we need our pages still to grow.\
\
[00:16:30.800] - Tracie\
And so and a side caveat here, that if you have people who aren't going to engage with your page, it hurts you. I could add one hundred people and none of them want to look or engage with my content. That hurts me where I can have maybe 10 people who are more interested and Facebook is going to like that.\
\
[00:16:45.860] - Tracie\
It's the same thing with our group. We only want people in our groups that want to be there. We don't want to just have people just for the sake of numbers, because it's not just a numbers game, it's an engagement game. So I don't recommend those. I really don't, because they do feel very impersonal. They feel like you aren't really trying to be helpful. And it's the same thing with even auto posting links to your content.\
\
[00:17:12.140] - Tracie\
I will share a link once in a while and I make it personal, like, hey, we just had a few questions in here about, you know, trying to start with SEO. Here's this great article I shared below. It might help some more of you. That kind of a thing, or it's like, you know, we're all talking about Thanksgiving and everybody's been sharing some Thanksgiving recipes. I've got this great roundup of my favorite 25 Thanksgiving side dishes that might be helpful.\
\
[00:17:36.680] - Tracie\
That's not being promotional. It's not on autopilot. It is you engaging with what's happening within your group. So... I get it. But I just don't know if they are really as effective as a lot of the administrators tend to think that they are.\
\
[00:17:53.840] - Liz\
Ok. And kind of following up on that, then, because as bloggers are to-do lists are a mile long.\
\
[00:18:00.510] - Tracie\
Right.\
\
[00:18:00.940] - Liz\
So adding like Facebook group and like where you're not , how do you kind of the time management aspect in the planning aspect of that? Tips?\
\
[00:18:11.230] - Tracie\
Yeah, I get it. So I recommend you use the internal Facebook scheduler, so you can still make your content very genuine by typing it instead of just auto posting that same image every Monday, which you can come in there and you can schedule out your content.\
\
[00:18:28.000] - Tracie\
You also could bring in an administrator to help you and that can be a member on your team. Maybe it's a virtual assistant you have and you can just add that as another position or thing that they take care of and they kind of help run your group. You also if you don't have that type of a position, what I did on my Facebook group with the site that I sold is I found two very active members in my community and I offered them an opportunity to earn some money by helping to run my group.\
\
[00:19:01.960] - Tracie\
So they understood what I was doing. They knew how to answer a question. They knew what to do to engage people. And they just split the week and they each worked so many days a week and ran my group. So that's another option is to maybe hire it out. And you want to pay a lot like the women that were running my group, they were like, well, I would just rather get like Amazon gift cards, I'm like score. I will pay you an Amazon gift card girl.\
\
[00:19:25.690] - Tracie\
So that was an easy win for me because they want to shop on Amazon. So I was able just to send them a gift card each week and they were happy with that. But ... Look within that community or hire some of that out because we can't be everywhere and we can't show up all of the time. And so it might be better for you to hire that out. Now I will say you're going to have to show up for a little while.\
\
[00:19:49.360] - Tracie\
You can't outsource that until your community starts to get a little engagement. You're going to have to show up. Once that happens, then you can consider bringing somebody in to help run your group.\
\
[00:20:01.570] - Liz\
OK, no, I like that so because not every blogger is going to have the budget for that is something, is starting a Facebook group, maybe not something you suggest doing at the beginning.\
\
[00:20:11.590] - Tracie\
Yeah, I would not.\
\
[00:20:13.600] - Tracie\
So when we're when you're just getting started, you are being pulled ten different ways from Sunday. And so your focus has to happen systematically. So I recommend that first six months, I wouldn't even think about a Facebook group. I really wouldn't. I would focus on learning the ins and outs of running your blog. That means learning your platform. And I would learn you know, Pinterest because Pinterest is an easy one for us to use. I would focus heavily on my SEO and that's your search engine optimization.\
\
[00:20:43.930] - Tracie\
And I would also work on building my email list because then you can start emailing that list. And what's really awesome is so if you built your list and you get people there, once you add that group at, at month eight, nine or 10, you already have a group of people who love your emails and you have a group of people right there who are going to funnel right over into your group.\
\
[00:21:05.890] - Tracie\
So it's not like you're starting this group from scratch and nobody knows about it. You have instant audience who will more than likely click and join your group. And that might... Because they've seen you when they come over and they join, they already feel like they know who you are. They will be more likely to be the people who start talking the first and engaging people the soonest.\
\
[00:21:28.600] - Liz\
OK, no, I like that. I've got like all sorts of wheels turning on the on the Blogger Breakthrough Summit group. OK, so we've covered kind of when to start and how to, how to grow things and engage what sort of... How, we talk about how Facebook group can help you increase your revenue, how?\
\
[00:21:53.320] - Tracie\
Much that's like everybody is, we come down to probably the reason most people are here, like I want a group because I want to make more money.\
\
[00:21:59.470] - Tracie\
That's what we are all doing this, so our group can be beneficial in a few different ways. Like the first one I said is your email, you can grab them when they first come in, but then you can also, if you have free courses through email like you do this email funnels or these challenges, you can share your email list every once in a while.\
\
[00:22:19.000] - Tracie\
I've actually taken an email that I've sent and I will post a link to it. Like this was my email. I just said, here's what you're missing out on. Here's how you can sign up. So they can see right there, because my list is where I sell to people. Right? I'm selling right in there. So that's one opportunity. Another thing you can do is there are affiliate programs all over the place, and as long as your program allows for it, you can post a link to a product right in your group.\
\
[00:22:46.570] - Tracie\
I will find discounts on services that I know my people are interested in and I will just pop in there like, oh, my gosh, you guys, this book I know you've been looking at, it's twenty dollars off right now and I put a link right there, a caveat real quick and just nobody can do this for Amazon in a closed group. So let's just put that out there. OK, so I will put that in there. I do my...\
\
[00:23:11.380] - Tracie\
Exactly. Yeah. You have to have your disclosure and your disclosure justs need to state that this is an affiliate link. That's basically what you have to put in there, FTC requirements. So don't try to not do it.\
\
[00:23:21.530] - Liz\
We will, we'll dive more on that in our legal sessions. We've got a lot of great Attorneys speaking.\
\
[00:23:26.620] - Tracie\
OK, then. The other thing you can do is you can post links to your articles that maybe have affiliates in them. So these are the ways it's just another traffic source. It's another way to get people like drive them where you want them to click. And so we want them to click on an affiliate link. We put it in front of them. We want them to click on this post to help, which is full of affiliate links. We put it in front of them.\
\
[00:23:50.980] - Tracie\
So those are the ways that we can make money directly through our sites. Now, if you have your own products, what I do a lot of times is I'll grab one of my products and I'll put it on sale like, hey, I've got an exclusive discount only for the members of my group. So only people here are going to get this discount for the next two days. And you can save twenty percent on this course. Because again, people like that exclusivity and I'll have people all the time going, oh my gosh, I've been waiting for a sale.\
\
[00:24:19.090] - Tracie\
So you can definitely make those people feel that being there has its benefits and its perks by offering discounts. And don't be afraid to ask your affiliates too, hey, can I get an exclusive offer that I can extend to my group? Your affiliate might say, sure, here's one. If that's the only place you're going to share it, let's go ahead and do it. So that's the way that we're making money directly through our group.\
\
[00:24:42.970] - Liz\
I like that.Yeah. And don't be afraid to ask. Like, the worst they're going to do is like, no, they're not going to, like, remove you from their affiliate program.\
\
[00:24:51.070] - Tracie\
Right. Yeah, exactly. Exactly. That's why I tell people all the time they're not saying like "no", like they're insulted. They're just saying, no, I can't do that from a business standpoint. So you never know unless you ask.\
\
[00:25:03.690] - Liz\
Exactly. Yeah, I feel a lot of bloggers are afraid to, they are just so excited for the opportunity to be an affiliate or the opportunity to like have a contract that they don't ask for things and try to negotiate.So it doesn't hurt to ask now.\
\
[00:25:17.380] - Tracie\
Not at all. Not ever.\
\
[00:25:19.410] - Liz\
All right. So. What else would you say is important to running a group that's going to foster community so that you are making more and you are growing? And it's one thing I want to touch on. So a closed group is searchable, right? I would assume...\
\
[00:25:34.490] - Tracie\
It is still searchable. They will be able to find it. So that's where your "about" is so, so very important. And so when you set up your group within your about, you can use keywords. All right. We all know keywords, guys. We had keywords on Facebook too, hate to break it to you. So can't you escape the magical world of keywords, even when you're trying to do a Facebook group. So we want to use that because that's how people are going to find us.\
\
[00:25:58.310] - Tracie\
What's really great, that engagement and we've all been in those groups and you know, how it so suggested groups you might want to join because you were in this other one. The more engaged your group is, the more likely it is to be recommended as another group someone might want to join.\
\
[00:26:17.330] - Liz\
OK.\
\
[00:26:17.960] - Tracie\
And so it's a it's a missed opportunity if you're not trying to get your group to be engaged, because Facebook's not going to send people to a group that nothing's happening in.\
\
[00:26:27.200] - Tracie\
They just aren't they are going to send people to a group or some people are talking. They're going to start recommending it. So we want to make sure that we're engaged just so we can get those, that recommendation to show up to get people to our group without us having to really do anything to really get them there.\
\
[00:26:45.660] - Liz\
Got it. So what other, I think that's a great thing to touch on. So what other aspects of Facebook SEO should group owners pay attention to or try to focus on?\
\
[00:26:56.780] - Tracie\
All right. So when you create your page, which everybody needs a page, even if you're gonna have a group, because the page is where you advertise, you can't do any advertising through a group, but when you have your page, you can connect your page and your group.\
\
[00:27:11.120] - Tracie\
So someone lands on your page, your group will show right on your page. So you've got that free opportunity there to get them. You can also link to it in your email newsletter that you have a group, let people know to come join you. You can put it in blog posts. I know people who those little social icons that we all see and every site like follow me on Pinterest, Facebook and whatnot, they change the Facebook link from their page to their group.\
\
[00:27:38.430] - Tracie\
So when they click the Facebook icon, they're instantly dropped into that group where they can join rather than sending them to the page to find the group. So don't think you have to link only Facebook to your page. You can link it there instead. So those are some opportunities. One fun one I like as far as trying to get that growth is find somebody in your niche that maybe work together and promote it to other's groups. You can go into your group like, oh my gosh, you guys, you need to come look at Liz's group.\
\
[00:28:09.320] - Tracie\
It's incredible. She's talking all these things.\
\
[00:28:11.840] - Tracie\
I'm in there and we're having so much fun. And then Liz would do the same thing. Oh, my goodness, guys, if you're just getting started, you've got to go check out Tracie's group. Here's what she's doing over there. So you're helping each other.\
\
[00:28:22.770] - Tracie\
There's this feeling, everyone feels like if I promote somebody else's group, they're all going to leave mine, but they won't. They'll stay in both.\
\
[00:28:29.700] - Liz\
No, it takes effort to leave a group. They have to actually do something.\
\
[00:28:33.730] - Tracie\
Exactly. Exactly, exactly. So Facebook is smart, like if they start ignoring it, they'll just show it less to them. So, yeah, you don't want that either. Right? But yeah,\
\
[00:28:47.100] - Tracie\
But that's what people are. I mean, this people just are inherently lazy is not the word I'm looking for, but that's the best way to describe it, because it does take a lot of effort to leave a group. They'll just add another one and another one and then eventually, they're like "ugh I'm in too many, I need to clean some up"\
\
[00:29:03.060] - Liz\
Yeah, every once in a while but it doesn't happen that often. I don't remember the last time I went through mine. And I I bet you if I went to go look at my list of groups, I'd be shocked. Feel like I have no recollection of that group.\
\
[00:29:14.110] - Tracie\
Exactly. Right. Exactly. And so and here's the thing. The other thing you have to realize is it's like our email list when people unsubscribe. Everyone's like "ugh I go unsubscribe" Thats a gift.\
\
[00:29:26.250] - Liz\
Right.\
\
[00:29:27.000] - Tracie\
That's a gift because they're telling you they're not interested. They're never going to buy. Your group is the same way. If those people are leaving, they were never going to engage with your content. They were never going to be a part of your community. Celebrate those people leaving that those people have told you. You know what? I don't want to clutter your membership or mess up your engagement stats. So I am going to leave right now.\
\
[00:29:51.720] - Liz\
Yeah, no. And I think that's one of the things that you'd rather have a smaller, more engaged group, because Facebook is going to recognize that as good than like a gigantic group where like half of percent of the people in it do anything.\
\
[00:30:07.470] - Tracie\
Yeah, well, and the thing is, too, sometimes when those groups get really big, they become more difficult to manage because there's so much happening. And I've seen countless groups that had one hundred and two hundred thousand people just get shut down overnight because they just can't control them anymore.\
\
[00:30:20.910] - Tracie\
So you don't want that either. So again, numbers are just numbers. You know, numbers don't mean anything I mean,\
\
[00:30:29.130] - Liz\
We focus on them a lot as bloggers. And the really only number you want to pay attention to is your bank account.\
\
[00:30:33.600] - Tracie\
Exactly it.\
\
[00:30:36.390] - Liz\
You don't need one hundred thousand pages to make a full time living with a blog.\
\
[00:30:40.470] - Tracie\
Yeah, well, I don't I, I will be honest, you guys, I'm not even getting ten thousand pages a month and I make a full time income, so yeah. You don't have to have a ton of page views to make money running a blog\
\
[00:30:54.480] - Liz\
And like a good income to you're not like struggling, you're like a six figure blogger.\
\
[00:30:58.680] - Tracie\
Exactly. Yep, yep,\
\
[00:31:00.930] - Liz\
Yes. All right. So anything else? Let's kind of try to wrap up anything else people know about Facebook groups, about running one, anything we haven't touched on?\
\
[00:31:11.010] - Tracie\
No, I don't think so.\
\
[00:31:12.180] - Tracie\
I think we've kind of hit everything that's important. I just tell people to try. You know, we're always as bloggers, we're trying. And I want you to try and you fail, never to try it at all. So try that group. If it doesn't work and it's a colossal failure, OK, chalk it up to experience. Maybe try going a different angle with that group or try to be more niche down with that group and give it another go.\
\
[00:31:36.960] - Tracie\
But don't say, "I can't have a group." Don't say, "I shouldn't have a group" and probably don't even say, "I don't want a group." I really think everybody could benefit by running a successful Facebook group.\
\
[00:31:48.450] - Liz\
Yeah, it's and the beauty of blogging is it's all editable, right, it could be two years later, like, you know what I think I'm ready to try a group again and you're not starting completely from scratch. You tweak a few things like I can't tell you how many times I've been, "oh, yeah. I made that checklist like three years ago that I could give to people," you know, so it's just kind of keep it in your back pocket if it doesn't work out first time.\
\
[00:32:12.340] - Tracie\
Absolutely. Just don't be afraid to try, guys. It just you have nothing to lose but potential dollar signs.\
\
[00:32:19.530] - Liz\
Exactly. All right, so, Tracie, thank you so much. I learned a ton. Got all sorts of ideas for the Blogger Breakthrough Summit Facebook group. Now, everyone should make sure they're part of it. Definitely check out Tracie's Facebook group as well. Again, just thank you so much. I love having you as a speaker.\
\
[00:32:34.230] - Tracie\
Thanks for having me, it was so much fun.\

**Transcript:**\
[00:00:00.000] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
All right, guys. We are here today with Tracie Fobes from traceyFobes.Com. Tracie, welcome. Thank you.\
\
[00:00:06.410] - Tracie Fobes\
Thanks for inviting me.\
\
[00:00:08.140] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
Yeah. And we're going to be talking about sponsored posts or sponsored content. It could be various things. And I'm really interested in learning about it because I actually haven't done sponsored content that much. I've been blogging for over five years, and I've maybe done two sponsored content, like total.\
\
[00:00:27.450] - Tracie Fobes\
So.\
\
[00:00:28.490] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
I'm excited to learn more about this because I know it's something you've had a lot of success with. Do you want to just give us a little bit about your background and some of the stuff we'll cover today?\
\
[00:00:37.540] - Tracie Fobes\
Absolutely. So yes, I am Tracie Fobes, and a lot of people know me through my first website, which was pennypinchinmom.Com. And I started that in 2009, figured out how to monetize that, and grew that over 11 years. And this last about a year and a half ago, I started having more people ask me about how to do what I was doing, including the sponsored posts and how I was making money. So I started moving into coaching, and I realized this is where I want to be. I loved doing the site, don't get me wrong, but I had moved on from that. So this last summer, I've been hemming and high. What do I do with Penny Pinchin Mom? And someone approached me to buy it. And so in October of last year, we finalized our contracts, and I sold my first website, which was pretty darn incredible. What was really cool about Penny Pinchin Mom was that's where I learned. And at the point that I sold that site, I was making five figures a month continuously just from sponsored work. And because it was such an integral part of the income structure for that site, that's what led me to want to teach others how to do that because we need content and sponsored posts just makes sense.\
\
[00:01:52.880] - Tracie Fobes\
So that's what's led me to where I'm at today.\
\
[00:01:55.900] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
Awesome. Yeah, no, I like that. That's nothing to sneeze at. That's oftentimes a lot more than people are making 9:00 to 5:00s or whatever when they're working on building their blog if they aren't full-time yet. So what are some of the things you think we want to make sure to cover today?\
\
[00:02:15.190] - Tracie Fobes\
Okay, I want to talk about first we want to go over the legal mumbo jumbo, because everybody knows you've got to have your legal stuff. So we'll cover that. We're also going to talk a little bit about where to find these sponsors, because that's the struggle a lot of people have. We'll talk about a few tools to have at your disposal. So when you do get maybe somebody emailing and you start talking to someone, you can give them great information. We're also going to talk about the number one question every person has is, How much should I charge? That is really where the magic happens. And there are so many things that people need to consider that you might actually be surprised at where I'm going to tell you to start your sponsored post pitch.\
\
[00:02:56.560] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
Okay. I'm excited for that. And so we are going to talk legal stuff just so you know. It's informational educational only. You should maybe talk attorney if you have questions or concerns. We do have three sessions on legal stuff, related to blogging, in the Summit. So definitely check out those as well, all with attorneys. Okay, so let's just start. Well, actually, before we dig into that, what is a sponsored post?\
\
[00:03:22.470] - Tracie Fobes\
Okay, a sponsored post is an article that you write on your site or you do a social share or something on behalf of a brand, a company or another party, and they pay you to do that. So it gives you ideas as to what to write about, but then they're giving you money to write on their behalf.\
\
[00:03:42.690] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
Okay. And because you're being paid for this, this is where the legal stuff comes in. The Federal Trade Commission, FTC, requires that you disclose this at the top before you even dig into the content.\
\
[00:03:55.300] - Tracie Fobes\
Absolutely. Just like if you do affiliate marketing, we always say you have to put, Hey, this post contains affiliate links. Blah, blah, blah.... It's the same thing here, except this time we have to say, This is a sponsored post on behalf of company name. All opinions are my own, point blank. The reader has to realize that when it is sponsored, they need to know that this article you're about to read, someone paid to put it here. There is a reason it's on my site. I'm going to be talking a lot about this company, and I'm going to be saying these things about them. So if it appears to read like an ad, that's why.\
\
[00:04:35.540] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
Okay. Yeah. So make sure you do that disclosure. Make sure it's at the top.\
\
[00:04:39.800] - Tracie Fobes\
Absolutely.\
\
[00:04:40.860] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
Okay. So now you know what it is, what you have to do before the content is showing up on your site. How do you find opportunities?\
\
[00:04:49.510] - Tracie Fobes\
Okay. So there's a couple of different ways. There's three different directions you can go. One is through networks. The second is to pitch yourself. And the third is you get pitches back to you. So I just touch on each of those. So networks are out there where you can sign up. And these companies that want people to write, they come and find you through them. One of them, for example, is called Izea, I-Z-E-A, free to join. And you sign up, you connect your analytics, your accounts, everything, your social. And then what happens is these companies who are looking for somebody who maybe has the same target audience that they want to reach, the same demographic, the same social, they will reach out to you to say, Hey, we think you're a fit. We'd like you to write for us. And you go from there. There's also where you pitch. This is where you cold email companies. For example, if you happen to be a financial blogger and you follow Dave Ramsey, you might pitch their PR department and say, Hey, I write this a site. I think that your every dollar app early, I can't think of the name of it, but I think it's.\
\
[00:06:00.380] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
Everyi don't know. Literally, my personal find my most popular post is why I don't like it.\
\
[00:06:05.190] - Tracie Fobes\
Okay, you see, it's funny. That's the whole point. You reach out and you're like, I think this would be a fit. Let's talk. Then you start the conversation and you go from there. And the third kind is where the company comes to you. And once you start writing more and you have more of a social presence, you'll start to get these emails. A lot of times they might be DMs through Instagram, or they could be messages on your site, direct emails, et cetera. But then companies are going to come to you and say, We think you are a fit for, fill in the blank, and we would love to work with you to create sponsored content. So that's the different ways we find the people that want to work with us to give us, or to pay us to write on our site about them.\
\
[00:06:48.020] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
Yeah. I just want to take a note there because the two I've done, they've pitched me, right? As you said, they think they're a great fit. You want to make sure they're a great fit. You don't just want to take every opportunity just for the money because it's really disingenuous to your audience.\
\
[00:07:04.790] - Tracie Fobes\
Absolutely. So one of my funniest pitches was when I got a request, we wanted to do a sponsored post, etc, and it was some a bidet company. I write financial work. I'm not going to write about bidets. But it also comes to something you can't get behind. I didn't believe in credit cards for years. I would get pitches from companies to write about credit cards. I couldn't do it because ethically, I couldn't write about that. So it's not even just a fit for your audience, but it is also something you personally can support. Do not sell out for a buck. Whatever you do, that's not going to help you.\
\
[00:07:43.030] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
Yeah, totally. Yeah, I remember I would get a lot of pitches because my personal finance was less debt, more wine, and it's about money. But I would get all these pitches for alcohol or a party thing. And I'm like, You clearly didn't look at what my site was. You saw the wine part, and I was like, That's not at all related to what I'm doing.\
\
[00:08:05.830] - Tracie Fobes\
Yeah. It's one of the things that I think that you get so excited when someone wants to pay you that you jump with the dollars. And we just can't do that as bloggers because your integrity trumps money every day of the week.\
\
[00:08:20.060] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
Absolutely. Yeah. So I just wanted to touch on that. Okay. So once you've found an opportunity, you received one, what's that pitch look like? What's that next step if you get a pitch that you're actually interested in taking up their offer?\
\
[00:08:36.000] - Tracie Fobes\
So yeah, that's a great question. So once you get a company that's like, Hey, we'd like to work with you. The next thing you always want to do is like, Great. Here's my media kit. Your Media Kit is a resume that we have for our blog. It includes a lot of factors. You will tell them who you are. You're going to include your target audience, who it is you are writing for. Because let's say you write about retirement, and this is a company about retirement, but they're targeting the 40-plus crowd. You write for the 25-40 crowd. Your audiences are different. You want to have your audience in there. If you've worked with other brands in the past, you want to mention who you've worked with. Because when you can name drop, like I was able online, I've worked with Staples and Dollar General and Walmart and Target, these national companies that made people go, Oh, my gosh. If they worked with her, we need to work with her. You'll also include general stats such as your page views, your social accounts, different things like that. And the most important thing you have to have on there is your contact information, not your phone number.\
\
[00:09:40.220] - Tracie Fobes\
Do not put your phone number on there because you do not want that out there. Trust me.\
\
[00:09:44.840] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
Unless you have a Google phone number or something.\
\
[00:09:46.180] - Tracie Fobes\
Unless you have a Google voice number, that's fine. But your cell phone? Yeah, you don't want that on there. That would be a big mistake, trust me. But that's your media kit. Then the next sheet that you want to have is what we call your rate form or your rate sheet, and it is the supplement to your media kit. Your rate sheet is where you let people know what you charge. My trick that I recommend is the three-tiered rate sheet. Tier one is basic. I will write a post about you. That's it. So the second one can be something I'll write a post. I'll share it on all these social channels. I'll put it on Pinterest. I'll put it in my newsletter. You can put different things. Your top one can be, I'll do a video. I'll do all these extra things. And you have levels that people buy. The funny thing when you do that, you might experience what I do. I never had anybody buy my least expensive package. They always started with my second one because they wanted more. So we want to think about that when it comes to your pricing structure.\
\
[00:10:48.190] - Tracie Fobes\
So you pitch that back to them, and then you might even have some ideas. Hey, yeah, I think you're a fit. Here's what I think we should do. I think I should write a post. I think we could do really good with this, or I think it'd really be fun to do a Facebook Live where I'm using your product, or I'm planning on going there anyway. Can I just tweet and use a special hashtag where I'm talking about my experience? So you have to think about how you think you could use that. Some brands will already know what they want, and you can see if that works, but you start giving ideas as to what you're comfortable doing, because you don't want them to come and say, Yeah, we want you to have a Twitter party, and you're like, I've never done that, because you're not comfortable with that. So you just start the conversation and once you agree on the price, we're going to come back to another legal thing, which is your contract, not an attorney. I don't play one on TV. We have a.\
\
[00:11:38.120] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
Session where we talk about contracts as a blogger, that it's.\
\
[00:11:43.880] - Tracie Fobes\
So overlooked. But yeah. Yeah. Then you do your contract and you go from there.\
\
[00:11:48.170] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
Okay. And I'm just going to dig in a little bit more on this because I feel like it's a place people really get hung up on it, is pitching themselves. It's one thing if you find an opportunity on a network that is, they're looking for pitches, right? Absolutely. Or someone pitches you. But if you are totally in love with company, you use it all the time, you're like, I would love them to pay me to talk how obsessed I am. I feel like people get a little hung up on that. So any suggestions or tips on that front?\
\
[00:12:21.330] - Tracie Fobes\
Yeah. So the first thing you have to realize is you need to embrace your awesomeness. I mean, really, you're awesome. You've got a great site. You've got people who love you. If you don't believe me, go look at comments. Go look at feedback. Go look at your loves. All those things you're getting from social, to realize that I know this topic and people trust me. So that's the first thing is don't think you're not worth it, okay? Put that out of your mind. But then the next thing I tell people to do is you need to come up with a standard email. And what you will say is something like, Hey there, I was pitching you. Like, Hey there, I worked. My name is Tracie Fobes, and I'm used to Penny Pinching Mom. I run the website...Penny Pinching Mom. Our audiences align because just like you, I am trying to help families who are struggling to get out of debt, figure out how to do that when they can't put food on the table and they don't know which direction to turn. Here is a little bit more about my site.\
\
[00:13:17.320] - Tracie Fobes\
I started it here. Here's who I'm talking to. Here's a little bit about my background. Our audience is aligned. Here's my social. You talk about, here's what we have on social. We've got 600,000 on our Facebook page. We've got about 30,000 in our private group. Our newsletter reaches around 50,000 people every time we email, et cetera, et cetera. I think we should work together because I think your product is a fit because of, boom, why are they a fit? It's not just we have the same audience, what is it that you think is a fit between their product or their company and your site? You also want to talk about, I would love to work on a sponsored post with you where I can talk about your product, or you could say, I would love to write a post and also review your product because of this, or I would love to do a video showing me doing this product, or a live Q and A on my Facebook group talking about your service. So then you put in what you're thinking, and then you say, I look forward to hearing from you. Do not talk rates in email number one.\
\
[00:14:25.310] - Tracie Fobes\
Never, because you need to leave that open, because just because you have certain rates, they might pitch something totally off the wall that you could charge a lot more money for, and you don't want to get locked into charging them something that devalues your work. But what you will do is you'll get them your first page media kit with all of your stats on it, and you say it in there. I don't have mine very long. Mine were four paragraphs, no more than 2-3 sentences per paragraph. Short, sweet to the point, because they don't want to read an email about your whole life history from the time that your dad left the house when you were five and he went and he got hit by a car. They don't care about that, right? They care about her here and now.\
\
[00:15:10.550] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
Yeah. Okay. And I do want to, because you threw out some big numbers social wise, even if you aren't that big doesn't mean you can't- Exactly.\
\
[00:15:22.170] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
-my first sponsored post of the two I've done. I've been blogging for a year or so, and I was tiny. And I still got someone to pay me 100 bucks, 200 bucks. It wasn't a lot. I probably could have charged more, but I have no clue what I was doing. So just because you don't have like.\
\
[00:15:41.150] - Tracie Fobes\
50,000- I have in a lot of Facebook groups, and I keep saying this thing. Oh, you need 10,000 page views before you can do a sponsored post? No, you don't. What the sponsor is looking for is who you target. Let's think about, for a second, Pinterest. You see these people with like 10 million monthly viewers, right? And you see another one with 100,000 monthly viewers. What you don't know is they both get the same amount of traffic. Because the one with 100,000 is highly targeted, and they know what they're doing, and they're reaching the people that matter, where the other one is just flying in the wind, throwing spaghetti.\
\
[00:16:21.160] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
Against the wind. It's got tons of graphics people love and repin.\
\
[00:16:24.270] - Tracie Fobes\
But aren't- Exactly, right. It doesn't mean anything. So you want to make sure that you realize, I don't care if you have 20 people on your Facebook page, and you're getting a thousand page views a month, you can still do a sponsored post. You can't charge as much as the person who has more, but so what? I mean, I would take 250 bucks any day of the week over nothing. Yeah. So yeah, don't think you're too small. Don't think you're too new. Now I will say you can't start your site last week. You do need a little longevity. I would say I don't look at sponsored posts until you hit that six to eight month mark because you know what you're doing. You're getting to learn your audience. You're settled into your group. So once you hit that point in your blogging journey, that's when you can start thinking about sponsored posts.\
\
[00:17:15.640] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
Absolutely. Yeah, I totally agree with that timeline. Okay. So once you've got an opportunity, you've got a contract in place, and guys don't be afraid to review and ask for changes to your contract. I feel like bloggers have a really bad habit of just taking contract and be like, okay, and not being like, actually-.\
\
[00:17:43.550] - Tracie Fobes\
Because they're notorious for sliding in things like, you can't work with anybody else for a year.\
\
[00:17:49.970] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
Yeah. Non competition, not to apply.\
\
[00:17:52.360] - Tracie Fobes\
Exactly. I had somebody do that to me once and like, we have to have it. And I said, okay, then you're going to pay five times my rate. Guess what happened the next morning? I had a new contract in my inbox.\
\
[00:18:02.820] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
Yeah, exactly. If they are going to ask for non compete, then they need to pay you that exclusivity.\
\
[00:18:09.340] - Tracie Fobes\
I'm a freelance writer.\
\
[00:18:10.430] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
I'm like, I'm a freelance writer. Are you kidding me? And they're like, Oh, no. And half the time the editor, I mean, that was writing, right? Editor didn't know. They just forwarded the.\
\
[00:18:21.980] - Tracie Fobes\
Contract, right? Exactly. Yeah. They don't know. So yeah, review that. Things like in that contract look for things like access to your images. Do they get to use your images as they see? Do they get to reproduce your content somewhere? I mean, there are so many things they slide in. Do not be afraid to say no.\
\
[00:18:39.590] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
Yeah, exactly. Okay, so contract is signed, you've reached an agreement. How do you make this go well? Because I feel like a lot of people, what they do is they get the contract, they get the money, they write the post, and they're done. But the reality is to be more profitable, there's a lot more.\
\
[00:18:57.360] - Tracie Fobes\
You can do. Exactly. So what you want to do is you have to consider a few things. So within that contract and stuff, maybe you can use affiliate links because let's say it's a company that sells something and they're on one of your ad networks or your affiliate networks, and so they might be able to put some of those in there. So what I always say to do, and I'm probably one of the few people to do this, I always offer my sponsors a pre-preview of the content, and I make it very clear that the only changes they are allowed to make is to factual information about the product that may be stated incorrectly. For example, if I was offering an app and I said that you had a 14-day trial and they're like, Oh, no, we've changed that. It's now 21 days. I'll change that. If I say the app was a little tough to get to download and to get signed up, they can't say, No, it's not. Here's why. Nope. My review, my words. So I always put that to them, and they really appreciate that because they're paying me so they can see it.\
\
[00:20:03.220] - Tracie Fobes\
There's not these surprises, because invariably what will happen is you're going to hit publish. They're going to review it and go, Oh, wait, you said this wrong. You said this wrong. You said this wrong. Right? And then you have to change it anyway. Do that on the front side. That's one thing that I do. The minute you hit publish, there on your social do all of that. Send an email right away to your sponsor say, Hey, we're live. Here is a link to the post. Here are all of the social links. Here are the hashtags I use. That way they can follow everything. They can follow all of the, if it's trending, they can follow up with comments. Like on Facebook, they can pop in and answer questions, et cetera. Another thing I tell people to consider using are tracking links. Now, some sponsors will want to track link clicks within your article, and they will give you a tracking link so they see it on their site. You can also use these by going into Google and creating these trackable UTM codes or using Bitly or something like that, so you can track those clicks.\
\
[00:21:05.600] - Tracie Fobes\
You have Pretty Links something, but you can provide link tracking. Link tracking is something I charge extra for, just saying. But you can put that in there. So you can say, Okay, at the end, I'm going to talk about the end, when we're done with all this, something that happens a couple of weeks later, we can give them some information that makes you stand out from your competitors because you are doing something on the back end of your sponsored post that most people are not doing. But that's what we do. You want to do keyword research because you want to make sure it ranks. So don't forget to do that keyword research. You could even ask your sponsor, are there keywords you are targeting? Because if you ask them, they see, Oh, my gosh, they are really putting forth effort to make sure this article can rank on Google as well for us. Another win in your pocket and something a lot of your competitors may not be doing.\
\
[00:22:01.250] - Tracie Fobes\
But these.\
\
[00:22:01.800] - Tracie Fobes\
Are the little things that we do. Proof it like three and four times, like upside down, backwards and forwards. Check the sponsor's name spelling. I can't tell you how many times I've seen where somebody spells the sponsor's name incorrectly, or they linked to the wrong page for the sponsor or something like that. Check them upside down, backwards and forwards. You want to make sure that all of your links have a note. It's called rel equals sponsored is the new code Google wants us to use that signals to Google. I'm not trying to boost their ranking. You're going to show your sponsor that you are in compliance with Google.\
\
[00:22:36.830] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
And if they ask you to not do that run away-.\
\
[00:22:40.260] - Tracie Fobes\
Oh, my gosh. Right. Exactly. You hit the lead on- I.\
\
[00:22:42.430] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
Cannot tell you how many people like, you will get so many emails that are junk, they're like.\
\
[00:22:47.110] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
I'll pay.\
\
[00:22:47.490] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
You for this link. And it's like, No, that's not how this works.\
\
[00:22:51.480] - Tracie Fobes\
No. And that needs to be one of those first things that you talk about upfront to make sure that it's very clear in that negotiation process that every link will be no followed or using the sponsored tag. Right. Exactly. No follow- We're doing.\
\
[00:23:03.950] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
Tech sessions.\
\
[00:23:04.820] - Tracie Fobes\
Too, guys. We'll talk about that. Yeah, talk about that there. I'm just bringing, this is where that applies. Sometimes it's like that real life application. There you go. You're going to learn the tech stuff and I'm telling you now is where are you going to use that? But that'll be part of your whole negotiation process. You also want to make sure that you include, I always say like three to five links to the sponsor, no more. You're not going to link. Every time I mentioned the word lending tree, I'm not going to link to that. How many times in an article? I probably all mentioned them 30 times, 30 links. Holy heck, that's too much. So make sure you link at the first paragraph, there's a link. You have a link at the very last paragraph, and you link to the throughout the article.\
\
[00:23:44.280] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
Kind.\
\
[00:23:45.080] - Tracie Fobes\
Of like you would affiliate links because you have sponsors who are like, they'll look at your article and they want you to start linking to them more? Yeah, no, because it looks too addy. It just doesn't work. So yeah, that's what I do. When they get that back, hit your deadlines. There is nothing worse than saying, I will put this post live at 10:00 a. M. On January 23rd, and it's 4:00 p. M. And you're like, Oh, crad, I didn't get done yet. Don't do it. Stick to your timelines.\
\
[00:24:10.530] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
That's just a profession to build- It is. -from a professional standpoint. I think that is all some great information. I'm trying to see if I have other... Oh, I did want to ask, how much do you charge extra for the link tracking?\
\
[00:24:24.910] - Tracie Fobes\
So the link tracking, because I have to build that and provide that report, I'll charge $100 to $150.\
\
[00:24:29.700] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
Okay. So we're going to talk how do you decide what's charge?\
\
[00:24:34.230] - Tracie Fobes\
All of you guys are like, listening to this whole session. I'm sure waiting. Come on, tell me what I can charge. So your site is brand spanking new out of the box. You've been blogging for six months, $250 to start. Never accept less than $250. And the reason is your time. You have to write the content. You have to edit the content. You have to do all these things. Your time is worth something. This is not... Don't think, Oh, I don't have any traffic. I can't charge very much. Yes, you can, because it's on your site, freeging forever.\
\
[00:25:13.750] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
Well, unless you put in-.\
\
[00:25:15.310] - Tracie Fobes\
Unless you paid the same thing. Unless you paid the same thing. Unless you put in a.\
\
[00:25:16.820] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
Year- Unless you.\
\
[00:25:17.280] - Tracie Fobes\
Paid and joined in a year- Unless you're in a contract. Most sponsored work will be on your site for eternity.\
\
[00:25:22.160] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
Yeah. So I always add in the contract that I can't take down after. And I was like, chances are I'm not going to. But if I change directions on my site, I don't have to keep up content. And I've heard horror stories of someone being like, I took down a sponsored post and then two years after the fact, and they did a thing through PayPal to get the money back.\
\
[00:25:46.170] - Tracie Fobes\
Yeah. You do want to make sure that's in there. That's part of it, though. And they're using your site for ranking in Google. They're using your platform and your voice. They need to start. That's where I start. Then I do all the add-ons, so I have my base. Then we look at page views, and we have a range that we can go from low. We can charge like two and three dollars RPM for your page views, up to seven and eight dollars RPM, just like an ad network, because this is an ad. So we add that in. Then we add in ranges for social engagement and interaction, not just numbers, engagement. Because if you have a Facebook group with 20,000 people in it, but no one responds, who wants to pay for that? But if you have one with 10,000 and it's really active and you have good engagement, you can use those numbers. So we look at that. We look at Instagram. We look if you have a YouTube channel. We look at all those different social accounts, Pinterest, all these different things, and we come up with a base. Then we start add-ons, add-ons, newsletters, call-outs, and we can charge so much for newsletters, and we do rates on there.\
\
[00:26:57.020] - Tracie Fobes\
Not only the number of people on your list, but your open rates. Because I can have a list and I'm only getting a 10 % open rate, that's not worth as much as somebody who has an open rate of 35 % or your open rates. If they want video, if they want live, if they want you to go shopping on their behalf, if they want you to take your own pictures, all these different pieces, you start tacking on fees. The basic post, that's one thing. Most people don't want the basic post. They want all the fancy stuff. And so they want the fancy stuff, just like you go to those really expensive restaurants, everything's a la carte. It's all a carte when it comes to your sponsored rate as well. And what's really cool is in the store that I created, because this is so much, like how do I know what to do? I put together a calculator. You literally put in numbers, and it figures you guys rates. I had to do it every time, and I'm like, I'm so tired of manually doing this. I created this worksheet I was using for my sponsors, and then people asked me for it.\
\
[00:28:01.170] - Tracie Fobes\
So that's something that I do have available because it's so hard to figure out what to charge. You don't have to use it. Just putting it out there that is something that is out there for you. Okay.\
\
[00:28:11.540] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
Two follow-up questions, because some people may not know what is RPM? Okay.\
\
[00:28:16.280] - Tracie Fobes\
Rpm is your rate. It's your rate you charge per thousand impressions. So if you get 10,000 page views and your RPM is four dollars.\
\
[00:28:27.130] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
That's.\
\
[00:28:28.010] - Tracie Fobes\
My brain is not working. $40. Yeah, $40. I'm sorry, it's early, but that's basically what you do. So you do a divisional rate. So you figure four dollars for every thousand. So you would take that 10,000, divide that by a thousand, and then take that times your rate to figure out what to charge. That's what advertisers use to figure out when you're earning money through them, they do that same general theory. Okay. Yeah.\
\
[00:28:52.840] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
And then the other thing I want to ask you is graphics because obviously blog post you're doing feature... Is that included in the base rate? Are you referring sponsors to give you some of that? How do you work that out?\
\
[00:29:04.280] - Tracie Fobes\
So when it comes to the graphics, what I look at is I ask the sponsor if they have screenshots that they would like me to use or other images. When it comes to the additional images that I'm going to use on my site, I buy them, and obviously we don't use free. I go to reputable sites, I've remixed, deposit photos, one, two, three, RF, and I purchase the graphic that's going to be used. What a lot of times will do is I'll take two or three options. I'm like, Hey, here's the three images I'm thinking about using, and I'll just download the free watermarked copy, and I'll send that to the sponsor and say, Which one do you want? And then they can pick which one they like, or they might say, We have one we want you to use. If they give it to you to use, you are assuming that you have rights to use it, and they're on the hook if you don't. That's why I don't usually... I'm really careful with my graphics and images. I want to make sure I can use it. So I will usually buy them. I create my own pon.\
\
[00:29:59.290] - Tracie Fobes\
I create all of those things myself, because it has to be my esthetic, my voice and everything. I don't want somebody who doesn't get my brand to be creating something for me because then it's off brand and it doesn't fit. It doesn't mesh well, Pinterest, Facebook, Instagram, whatever.\
\
[00:30:17.900] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
Okay, perfect. All right. I think that was really all of my questions. I know you have a great free offer for attendees. Tell us about it.\
\
[00:30:27.940] - Tracie Fobes\
So what I've done is because I'm so big on learning, that's why I'm doing what I'm doing, I've got this free course. It's called Sponsored Success Incubator, and basically it's going to kickstart your understanding of doing sponsored posts. You're going to be able to get in there. You're going to talk about the legal stuff. We're going to talk about where to go find a sponsor. We're going to talk about all these little pieces. So you could really build your first sponsored post right when you get done with that. You don't even have to pay a penny, literally. Just take that freebie, dip your toes in and learn, because I don't want to be doing sponsored posts because it may not be a fit for you. I know some people that start and they're like, Yeah, no, I can't do this. So that's what I want. I want you to get some more understanding as to what these are about and how we go about doing them, so you know if it's a fit for you.\
\
[00:31:21.210] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
Yeah. And the link for that is below, guys. It's free. So it's really no risk.\
\
[00:31:28.420] - Tracie Fobes\
Exactly.\
\
[00:31:30.040] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
Okay. And then for those that purchase the All Access pass, you are also offering a great discount on a course. You want to tell us.\
\
[00:31:38.340] - Tracie Fobes\
About the course? Yeah. So I have my sponsored success course, which is extremely in-depth. It is video. It is swipe copy for those pitches you want to do. It's swipe copy when someone pitches you as to what to say back. Has Media kit templates, has the checklist in there so that you don't forget what to do. Invoice templates. There's access to a really super cheap, not cheap and quality, but a sponsored post contract written by an attorney for my course specifically. So it's got all of these different pieces. So when you start, it literally is going to step by step, put you right through doing everything. We even talk about what if they don't pay? You've even invoiced them at the end, and they're not paying you. What do I do now? All of these that go into sponsored posts because it's not as simple as you pitch me, I write a post, I send you a bill. There's so much more to it. And I want to make sure that you set yourself up for success with every sponsored post you write. Because when you do little things like, the one thing I said I didn't even touch on here, I'll just mention real quick.\
\
[00:32:49.780] - Tracie Fobes\
At the back side of your sponsored post, send your sponsor a detailed report recapping every link, recapping social shares, recapping page views, all of these different aspects from the post because you'll stand out that, Oh, my gosh. Here is a beautiful report of everything, so I'm not having to research this myself.\
\
[00:33:13.900] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
Yeah. And it makes it more likely they'll want to work with you again, right? Because the big money and sponsored content comes from working with, building partnerships with brands that you're working with repeatedly.\
\
[00:33:24.950] - Tracie Fobes\
Because a lot of them will come to PR firms, and that if they're in a PR firm, they're going to go, Oh, my gosh, we need to work with this person again for Company B and Company C and Company Z and all that. But that's all of what I cover in the course. And it's one thing, it's so funny. I'm one of these people that I'm a point here, click this, do that person. So when you take it, you're not left going, Okay, well, she said I should pitch, but how do I do that?\
\
[00:33:49.740] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
But.\
\
[00:33:50.710] - Tracie Fobes\
It's like the bonuses alone are worth more than the value of the course.\
\
[00:33:54.870] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
Yeah. And those that purchase the All Access Pass they get 30 % off.\
\
[00:33:58.780] - Tracie Fobes\
Yes. And I don't offer 30 % off anywhere else, just so you guys know.\
\
[00:34:02.430] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
Exclusive- Exclusive.\
\
[00:34:03.610] - Tracie Fobes\
To you guys. Yes.\
\
[00:34:05.440] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
I appreciate that. I appreciate your generosity with your time and everything. Thank you so much. Any just final words before we sign off?\
\
[00:34:12.910] - Tracie Fobes\
Like I said, I think you need to embrace the sponsored post. Don't be scared of it. Don't think you can't do them because you can't. Everybody can do sponsored posts. It's a matter of finding the right person who's going to pay you what you're worth.\
\
[00:34:27.780] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
Absolutely. All right, Tracie, thank you so much. I hope everyone got as much out of the session as I did. Thank you.\
\
[00:34:34.730] - Tracie Fobes\
This was awesome. I love this. Thanks, guys. And if you guys need anything, you have questions, just email me directly. Before you do a thing, I'm more than happy to help you.\
\
[00:34:42.840] - Liz Stapleton, Host\
All right, guys, definitely check out that. Thank you so much.\

**Transcript:**\
[00:00:13.190] - Elizabeth Stapleton\
All right, guys. I'm really excited for our next speaker. He is a personal finance nerd, an online entrepreneur. He and his wife were buried in student loan debt, which led them to start their personal finance blog. And three years later, or within three years, I should say, they were making multiple six figures. They've both been able to quit their jobs to work on the blog full time. They have a huge passion for helping people with money. And I'm really excited to welcome from 'The Savvy Couple', Kelan Kline. Kelan, thank you so much for being part of the summit!\
\
[00:00:40.610] - Kelan Kline\
Hey, Liz. Thanks for having us. We're so excited to be a part of it this year. \
\
[00:00:46.010] - Elizabeth Stapleton\
Yes. So we're going to be talking about sponsored content, sponsored post, sponsorships with blogs. And you mentioned actually that the first money you ever made was through sponsors. Do you want to share a little bit about that?\
\
[00:00:57.470] - Kelan Kline\
Yeah. After college, I kinda jumped around from job to job. We started our blog as kind of a side hustle to help pay off student loan debt. I was just done working for other people. And nine months into blogging, everyone that started blogging knows that first six months is just insane. The learning curve is crazy, and it's just a grind. And finally in the 9th month, we had an email come in and it said, "Hey, we want to sponsor a post on your blog. We're willing to pay you $50." And we were really small at that time. And just like a light bulb went off and we were so excited. We celebrated. And then two weeks later, I went to Brittany. And this was after we saved up a ton of money and got stable financially. And I said, "Hey, I'd like to quit my job and do this full time." She blessed me to do that. And the rest is history now.\
\
[00:01:41.810] - Elizabeth Stapleton\
Awesome! So, in that instance, someone had reached out to you directly. But that's not always how sponsorship opportunities come about. So obviously, that kinda whetted your appetite. How do you find sponsorships now? How did you when you were still new find those opportunities? Did you pitch directly? Was there a resource?\
\
[00:02:02.150] - Kelan Kline\
Yeah. Good question. I think it's important to know your numbers and know your blog, know your online business. So get those demographics, understand what your pageviews are, put together a nice media kit. That's the first thing that we did. We just made ourselves accessible on our site. We always have an "Advertise with us" page, so if there are brands coming to look to sponsor personal finance blog, we're super easy to access and get a hold of, where a lot of companies fail to do that. That's number one. And that's a good way to get a lot of inbound sponsorships. Then the outbound ones. We kind of take the approach...We're pretty analytical and really good with numbers. I put together an Excel sheet. I'm kind of an Excel nerd. And I have a list of 100 dream companies I would like to work with and it's all filtered by how much they align with our business, how easy they would be to partner with. Like, how big of a company are they. And we just go down the line every month and I reach out to a few. I make it a habit. I always put that time and effort into reaching out to sponsors and getting them interested in getting them to eventually work with us. It is a lot of outreach and a lot of work to do the outreach to get those sponsorship deals, for sure.\
\
[00:03:11.550] - Elizabeth Stapleton\
Sure. But you're using really an inbound or direct outreach. You're not using a website or something.\
\
[00:03:18.330] - Kelan Kline\
Yeah. There are a bunch of sponsored networks that you can use and sign up, and you link your analytics up to and stuff. We've never really found that much luck with them. We've been able to do a couple of social media campaigns, where it's a one-off Tweet or a one-off Facebook post where you get paid $50 to $100. But we're really focused on the big sponsorships that are going to move the needle in our business and give us a big thing of cash flow to reinvest.\
\
[00:03:41.190] - Elizabeth Stapleton\
Okay. So you mentioned media kit and the direct outreach. So what all besides your analytics, what all are you including in your media kit? What are you including in your pitches?\
\
[00:03:53.190] - Kelan Kline\
Media kit shares exactly what The Savvy Couple is about. So our mission, our demographics are very close to who our demographic is, which is millennial moms a certain, at 25 to 35 years old. So, just really understanding our business. Because the whole point of getting a company to work with you is they need help marketing, and they want to get in front of an audience that already has someone that's built trust with them and has that authority. So, they're willing to pay you to get in front of your audience that's their ideal customers. And just knowing your business inside out, it's really important.\
\
[00:04:24.930] - Elizabeth Stapleton\
Okay. So when you pitch, you're obviously including your media kit, but do you do a lengthy email? Is it like a short, "Hey, we'd really love to work with you. We think we really align. Here's our media kit"? How in-depth are you getting? How generalized are those pitches?\
\
[00:04:44.050] - Kelan Kline\
They're very optimized. I know that anyone that we're reaching out to, they have a busy schedule. And everyone's email box is just littered with emails. So it's very quick like, "Hey, my name is Kelan Kline. I'm a personal finance expert that runs The Savvy Couple." And then the next line is, "We're very interested in starting a long-term partnership." So, there are a lot of key terms that you need to use when reaching out to brands and working with them. And the ones that always triggers excitement in them is saying "Long-term partnership," because they don't want a one-off just like you don't. You want to be able to partner with the brand and partner with them year after year. So long term partnership, kind of explained how we align. So if it's a company that's helping increase income, that's exactly what we like to do, too. So we just pair our two missions into one so that we have that alignment. We give a quick thing of stats and bullet points. And at the bottom, we put who we've been featured on or partnered with before. And then the very end is, "Here's our media kit and About Us page so you can learn more." But, yeah. It very strategically, kind of, captivates them, gets them interested, shares exactly what they need to know. And it has had a really good success rate. \
\
[00:05:53.830] - Elizabeth Stapleton\
Awesome. It sounds like it gives them the information they need to want to learn more. Like it's not a waste of their time to keep going. So with the long term partnership, it's not probably just like a post here and there. What do those partnerships look like? How do you determine that? I know it varies by the company you're working with.\
\
[00:06:16.510] - Kelan Kline\
Yeah, that's a great question. So a lot of bloggers and us ourselves, when we are learning this process with sponsorships, they respond to our outreach email, and they'd say, "What does your budget look like?" Or "What is your fees for a sponsored campaign?" And we tell them, "It would be like, $500, $1,000." And they just kept answering like, "Sure, let's do it". Like, just way too easily. And being someone that's an entrepreneur and understands negotiation, I'm like something's up. We're worth more than what we're asking for because they wouldn't be saying yes every time. So then we came up with a strategy like, let's try to get them to tell us what their budget is before we say anything on what we're gonna, kinda the deliverables we're going to give them. So that's a key. And that's one of the big secrets in our strategy is, asking the company what their budget is. And there's a lot of strategy around that and how to word it correctly. But once you get that, the ball is in their court. So they're going to say, "Hey, we have $1,000", "We have $2,500, we have $5000, $10,000 budget. What can you do for us?" And at that point, I take that budget and I look across all of our marketing channels, our email list. We can do multiple blog posts. We've done YouTube videos, we've done social media amplification, we've done Facebook ads. So we put this whole marketing package together for this brand that just gave us what their budget is, and we pitch it to them, and send it in a nice wrap up proposal that they're very interested in. If they've given you a budget. They're interested in working with you. So chances are, if you can send them the right deliverables that they're looking for, you can land that sponsorship.\
\
[00:07:51.190] - Elizabeth Stapleton\
Okay, so, a couple of follow-up questions to that. What are you doing, sort of how are you deciding, okay, I've got this budget. What is that worth in terms of the deliverables I'm going to create? Because I feel like some people, especially if you're a newer blogger, if someone tells you I've got $1,000 budget, you're like, "I've got to do everything!" So how do you determine that?\
\
[00:08:13.870] - Kelan Kline\
It's definitely kinda part of the experience that we've had doing this for so many years now. But, yeah. I think in the beginning, you cut yourself short and say, like you said, I got to do everything. I got to send ten emails for this company and really deliver on them. And a lot of the times these partnerships are one-offs, and you want to do your best and you're going to do your best. But there's a lot of times that you're not gonna meet what they want, and that's okay. The important thing is to kind of, make sure that whatever their budget is, you're only putting in as much time and effort that you're willing to. So, know what your hourly rate is. If you're only willing to work $20 an hour, $25 an hour or you really want to make $50 an hour, you got to calculate how long it's going to take you to put all these assets together for them to run that campaign.\
\
[00:09:02.170] - Elizabeth Stapleton\
Okay. And then you say you put together a really nice proposal. What are you using to create that proposal?\
\
[00:09:07.630] - Kelan Kline\
Just Google Doc, and then I save it as a PDF. It's just a template and a form that we use. It's got our logo top. It kinda explains exactly what the campaign is all about, like an overview, then the deliverables and then the fees. Another thing that I forgot to mention is when you are figuring out what their budget is, another thing that you really want to do is become a good listener and really make it all about them when you're reaching out to this brand and they're starting to interact with you and get that interest. And figure out what their problems are in their marketing and how you can align and make sure you can solve those for them. So if they're looking for just brand awareness, that's a lot easier to do on social media than conversions, where you're going to have to run an email campaign that you can get conversions up. Or you can do call to actions on your blog or write SEO post. But it's important to understand what their problem is and then be that person that can solve it. Just like any business.\
\
[00:09:59.530] - Elizabeth Stapleton\
Yeah. That's a great point. So then, I know you're using their budget to align with the pricing. What happens when it's lower than you expect it to be? Are you just pitching a smaller deliverable? Or are you like, we're going to pass? How do you make that decision?\
\
[00:10:21.710] - Kelan Kline\
Yeah. Great question. Obviously, as a newer blogger, you're going to accept everything because you're making money and it's important to get that win. And that's how we used to be. Now we're very particular. We pass on a lot of brands that offer us a lot of money. It's really making sure that we keep that trust with your audience. And I can't explain how important it is to not just sell yourself out and take any sponsor that comes your way. Make sure it aligns and actually helps your audience. But yeah, if they don't have a budget that aligns with us. And ours now, since we have grown our SEO traffic and grown our brand, we have a pretty big email list. We don't accept anything under $2,500, which seems like a ton. And that's just for a sponsored post, so one article. So again, it's going back to how much time is it going to take you if it aligns with your brand. And then if it's lower than you think, you can literally send an email back and say, "Hey, this budget is a lot lower than we normally work with. We usually work at this price. Is there any way you can meet us halfway?" Or "With your budget, we can only really do X amount of stuff for you unfortunately." And a lot of times you'll turn them down, and then six months later, when you've grown your blog for six months, you can come back and circle back around. And that's something I always like to do and say, "Hey, this is what our stats are now. We'd like to partner again. Do you guys have a bigger budget type of thing?" Just keep that line of communication open. \
\
[00:11:41.090] - Elizabeth Stapleton\
Okay. I think it goes back towards the long-term continued communication. So when you've done a sponsored post, you've done a campaign with a brand and you want to keep that long-term relationship going to work with them again, what are you sending them afterwards that kind of shows the result? How are you showing the results of your work to make it easier to pitch later?\
\
[00:12:12.390] - Kelan Kline\
Yeah. So, you definitely want to send them the article or the YouTube video, whatever the link is or the main deliverable. And send them any social media links that you've sent out. Facebook ads have worked really well for us. That's definitely an advanced marketing technique. But you're able to target an audience and send traffic to an offer. You can make a ton of conversions and people love to see that, as companies. So, I send them screenshots of our Facebook ads. Just keep them updated through the entire process. Say, "Hey, our team's working on the post right now. We're going to send it next week for you to review." Just make them a part of the process. And if it doesn't go as well, you can share why, your feelings on why you didn't think it went as well. But yeah. Just keep in touch over the time. On our Excel sheet too, we like to keep track of the name and the email that we've used, last time we connected with them, and just build that real relationship. Because one of our biggest sponsors we ever had, they asked for our physical address, and they sent us Christmas presents and a Christmas wreath. It was awesome. We obviously built a real relationship with that person we were working with. So, that's huge.\
\
[00:13:21.210] - Elizabeth Stapleton\
Yeah. I think a lot of times people forget whether you're an online business or not, that behind every business are people. You know.\
\
[00:13:32.490] - Kelan Kline\
Exactly.\
\
[00:13:32.540] - Elizabeth Stapleton\
So you're sending them the information, the stats, the results. So, I want to follow up because you mentioned you run ads and ads costs money. So, how are you kind of, how much of maybe the income you're taking from the sponsored post is potentially going towards ads?\
\
[00:13:48.750] - Kelan Kline\
Yeah. Good question. So in our proposals, we usually pitch like a $250 campaign, $500 campaign. We've done $1,000 campaign. And every time we do that, we have the company pay for the ads, and they also pay a little fee for my time to put them together. So if we're running $500 campaign, I usually charge $1,000. $500 of my time plus $500 for the ad campaign. And that's good for them, because whether it works out or not, they get data on marketing from an influencer on how they would market their brand and just really invaluable information. And a lot of times, we've had campaigns that have worked incredibly. And we're all making money. So, we just continue them to run until they run dry.\
\
[00:14:31.650] - Elizabeth Stapleton\
Okay. So, you're saying we're all making money. Obviously, you make money from the sponsored post. Are you also then an affiliate for the company and you're making affiliate commissions as well? Is that usually...\
\
[00:14:41.370] - Kelan Kline\
Correct. I would say 75% of the time we're allowed to use our affiliate links within the sponsored post. So, yeah. We kind of negotiate so, we get a flat front up fee as well as affiliate commission.\
\
[00:14:56.130] - Elizabeth Stapleton\
Which again, that's that long term. Because the upfront fee is a one time but the commissions keep going.\
\
[00:15:00.510] - Kelan Kline\
Yes. Which is another point I want to make. A ton of bloggers, we all get these. I'm sure you get a ton of them, is affiliate emails. People reaching out to you and say, "Hey, we would love for you to join our affiliate. We're paying X amount of dollars. It's a perfect match... bla bla." Obviously, we delete a ton of those. But there are some that are like, Wow, this company wants affiliates. They might have a marketing budget. Let's kind of twist this and say, "Hey, we will join you to our brand. We'll start marketing you as a company that we love and enjoy. It's going to help our audience. But first, we want you to give us a flat fee to do a sponsored campaign with us, and then we'll join the affiliate program and promote you long term." So, a lot of times those are awesome outbound emails that you can send to kind of take those cold, outreach affiliate emails to you and turn back and make some awesome money from them. \
\
[00:15:49.410] - Elizabeth Stapleton\
Yeah. And then you're making money that much faster because affiliate income can take a while. And even if you earn those commissions, they might not be paid out for months.\
\
[00:15:58.170] - Kelan Kline\
Right. \
\
[00:16:00.930] - Elizabeth Stapleton\
Okay. So another thing I want to ask...And I'm not going to ask you to get into too many details because we have a session with a lawyer on this. I assume you're signing a contract. I really hope. What sort of terms are you including in there? I've heard horror stories of people being, like, "Two years later, the post no longer aligned with my brand. I took it down." And then they did a charge-back on PayPal. So, what kind of terms are you including in your sponsorship agreement?\
\
[00:16:27.930] - Kelan Kline\
Yeah. So, we use a sponsored agreement that we got from a lawyer as well. And it's super easy to fill out and reuse it over and over. But, yeah. You're making sure everyone is on the same page with what the deliverables are, the time frame on when they're due, how long they're going to last, the pricing that's going to get paid, the pricing structure...Are you going to get paid up front? In the middle? At the end? Multiple payments or one payment at once? Just all the very important information that you definitely want to get in a contract signed by everybody. You can use an email thread as your contract but it's definitely better...\
\
[00:17:03.750] - Elizabeth Stapleton\
Yeah, it's written. We have an entire session with an attorney talking about contracts for bloggers. So, I'm not going to ask you to say what qualifies as a contract. But just kind of knowing those terms because I think a lot of people don't think about, well, I may want to take this down someday. And some of those other things. What are some other mistakes or roadblocks that you've made or that you've heard of that obviously you've learned from, but what are some things you see happening a lot?\
\
[00:17:31.590] - Kelan Kline\
Yeah. This one happened this year, actually. We agreed verbally and writtenly in an email, and we put together two sponsored posts for them. We started to put the campaign together, and then all of a sudden it's like, "Hey, we're not going to do it anymore. We're backing out. We're not paying you." It was like, EH! That was the first time it has ever happened. So, we have a rule now that we get paid at least a deposit upfront. And mostly, I'd say 99% of the time, it's "Give us everything up front." Unless it's a massive campaign, then we'll do half up front, half at the end. So definitely a roadblock is making sure you get paid up, paid in advance and just talking your way into doing that just to protect yourself so that you do get payment up front and then you can do the deliverables. You don't get caught out to dry. \
\
[00:18:17.010] - Elizabeth Stapleton\
Yeah. No one wants to chase invoices.\
\
[00:18:19.050] - Kelan Kline\
Exactly.\
\
[00:18:21.330] - Elizabeth Stapleton\
So what is the timelines of, oftentimes from, whether you guys outreach or they reach out, to deciding on the terms, to when everything gets published and sent out and the campaign runs and how long is the campaign? What does that timeline look like?\
\
[00:18:36.450] - Kelan Kline\
Yeah. So I'd say the cold outreach emails, it's sometimes hard to find people in the corporations and in the company. And all big companies work very slowly. So it's usually about a month to get to the right person, start talking. And then from there, the timeline really depends on, like one of the companies we were working with is H&R Block and tax season is on its way. So there's a deadline like, we want this content now at this point in the year, so that it's pitched at the right time, and it makes sense with H&R Block. So, there's a lot of stuff like that as far as timelines, and that's just how you go off things. But I'd say, from start to finish, you outreach email to the end of the campaign where you're done with your social media, you're done sending emails, probably two to three months, most likely. \
\
[00:19:31.210] - Elizabeth Stapleton\
Okay. How many, and obviously, it's going to depend on various factors, but how many sponsorships are you doing on average a year? How many would you recommend a new blogger do, if they can get them?\
\
[00:19:40.450] - Kelan Kline\
Yeah. I think realistically, one a month is totally doable for just about anybody, no matter how small you are. Companies want to get in front of brands, and they know, well sometimes you have to teach them this. But there's value in partnering with smaller companies, because then two years from now, the blog is going to be much bigger and you're still going to be getting promoted by them. So I think one a month is definitely doable. We try to land at least one big one per month and then our best month, we probably did four. So in a total year, we're doing anywhere from 12 to 20 sponsorships. And a lot of them are with companies from before. So it's promoting the same companies that align with our brand and we work before. So it's just a win-win for everybody.\
\
[00:20:27.070] - Elizabeth Stapleton\
That sounds great. So, I know you said your very first money blogging was $50 sponsorship. How big do you think the site has to be before they start going off after those sponsorships? Because it's probably not as big as they think.\
\
[00:20:39.010] - Kelan Kline\
Yeah,no, that's an awesome question. I think it's important to be able to get traffic to your blog and understand what you're doing, understand how to create content that gets seen and write good titles. It's important to be able to market yourself before you market someone else. So, I don't know if there's an exact number. It's feeling confident in being able to market yourself and get the traffic. I feel like I started reaching out when we had 1000 page views a month, which starting out, that's huge. It takes a long time to get to that point. But then once you do, you can definitely start reaching out, especially if you have social media channels, followings in other places and email lists. You can just build those assets that you can pitch the brands. \
\
[00:21:21.370] - Elizabeth Stapleton\
Yeah. And the more you do it, the more you're able to. I think when other brands see that you've worked with brands, even if they're not big-name brands, it shows that you know what you're doing. So, you got to start somewhere.\
\
[00:21:31.330] - Kelan Kline\
Yep. Absolutely. And I think that's a good point, that you want to start with smaller brands. You don't want to go after...If you're trying to work with Target, you don't want to go after Target if you're just brand new. Start with a brand that's much smaller and work your way up, build up your experience. And then when you have your stuff together and you have the experience, you know how to do communication, networking, and negotiating, then you can check those big partners.\
\
[00:21:54.490] - Elizabeth Stapleton\
So one thing I want to ask you is, because I also have experience to try to track down the right person in the organization, it can be rather difficult. What are, sort of, the titles of the people that you found are the right people to be reaching out to when you're looking for a contact?\
\
[00:22:12.790] - Kelan Kline\
Definitely affiliate managers. Because you're in the right department there as far as sponsorships or marketing, marketing channels, press pages, some people that are looking for press. A lot of the companies will have at the very bottom. You can see Affiliate or Press or Marketing or Media, any of those kinds of channels will get you started in the right spot. And, you know, sometimes you got to start with someone that's in totally wrong department and just say in the PS like, "If this is the wrong person, can you point me in the right direction to the right person to contact?" And that's huge.\
\
[00:22:44.350] - Elizabeth Stapleton\
It does. It works really well. It would surprise you. People are like, this is not me. But instead of just ignoring it and not replying, they'll be like, "Oh, well, they know it might not be me, and I can pass this along." It always surprises me when that works because it's such a simple thing. So, any last bits of advice before...I know you've got something that you have for our audience, but any final words of advice?\
\
[00:23:11.590] - Kelan Kline\
Yeah. I think the biggest thing with all things blogging is, build your confidence. Know that you are an awesome individual to even go out on a limb and start your own project, start your own business. And sponsorships definitely it's a part of the blogging business that it takes a lot of confidence and takes a lot of encouragement to go out and do it. And you're going to hear a lot of Nos before your Yeses. So just get out there. Practice. Start with a small fish. Practice makes perfect. So just start working on the small fish and getting practice and getting experience and then slowly work your way up. And bloggers and online creation can get sponsorships everywhere. \
\
[00:23:46.270] - Elizabeth Stapleton\
