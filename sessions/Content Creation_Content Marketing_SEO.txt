Hi, everyone. Welcome to the Blogger Breakthrough Summit. So excited to have you here. My name is Aisha Preece, and I'm the founder and owner of personal finance and lifestyle blog and beyond.com.

[00:00:24.460] - Aisha
And I also run three other monetized new sites. And I'm going to teach you about SEO. And how you as a new blogger or maybe you're an advanced blogger, I'm going to teach you how to get lots of Google traffic and what Google love. Okay. So, I know you're busy.

[00:00:38.460] - Aisha
So, let's get to it. Let me share my screen and we can get you learning about SEO, so you can get all this beautiful Google traffic. Okay. So, today, I'm going to teach you the 3-step formula for SEO success. And I'm going to simplify as much as possible because I know there's a lot of information out there that overwhelms us.

[00:00:58.720] - Aisha
And I know as a new blogger, it was like everyone saying something different. There's so much work, probably some of us juggling a full time job. Let's simplify it. What are three steps to take to start getting Google traffic? And so, I'm going to walk you through them now.

[00:01:12.310] - Aisha
Let's take it back a notch and figure out who am I actually, who am I? And why am I teaching you about SEO? So, what we have here is a classic photo of me with a filter. So, yeah, it's a catfish.

[00:01:25.690] - Aisha
I know that looks similar or not, but I set my blog up, my first blog up in 2018, and I did absolutely nothing with it because I didn't know how to do anything with blogging. And I kind of fussed about, didn't get any traffic, didn't get any income. And I really wanted to. I really wanted to earn a full-time income from my blog, but I didn't know how. And so, unfortunately, in October 2019, my best friend passed away suddenly, and this was a wake up call. I said, you know this is my dream.

[00:01:54.570] - Aisha
Do it. If you have a dream, you have one thing you want to do in life, go for it. And so what I did was I said, okay, I'm going to get traffic and income from my blog, and I'm going to make it happen. And I went through a series of mistakes and trials and errors and ugly smocky tears and the crying, wondering if blogging is dead.

[00:02:11.910] - Aisha
I knew the concept of how to make money blogging, but I know to make money blogging, you need traffic, so makes sense, right? And I was living la Vida broker. I could not afford paid traffic, paid ads. I did try Facebook groups. I did try you know, and when you try and be helpful in Facebook.

[00:02:27.610] - Aisha
But the thing about Facebook is there's not a keyboard warriors. I don't know if you've experienced that. And so, I found that I didn't have any control over. Let's say that I was sharing my article. If someone commented in someone else's Facebook group, I didn't have control over that.

[00:02:41.600] - Aisha
And that really got to me, because sometimes people say really mean things. And I did try Pinterest. And I did get a lot of success with Pinterest. But Pinterest is a lot more time consuming compared to Google. Google is way more passive.

[00:02:55.670] - Aisha
And so, another thing that I looked into was what about these SEO agencies, these experts, and guys, they cost so much money, I could not afford it. I couldn't afford an agency. So, I needed to figure out how to do it myself. I did a lot of, I saved up, there's a lot of expensive courses, some were useful, some were completely useless. And you know a lot of them outdated. And Google and SEO now, it changes very often.

[00:03:23.270] - Aisha
And so, the concepts I'm teaching you today are relevant for now, which is quite important, right? And so after all this, you know ugly tears in my living room with snot all over my face, I figured it out. I figured out a three step formula, which I implemented on my first blog. And I was, in September 2020.

[00:03:44.120] - Aisha
I was sitting at about 7000 page views barely. And then I implemented that formula again and again. And seven months later, I got nearly 100,000 page views a month. I qualified for Mediavine in January 2021. And now I just checked the last 30 days.

[00:04:01.260] - Aisha
And I'm sitting at over 140,000 page views, which is so amazing. And I've implemented these strategies, this three step formula in three of my other niche sites, which are now getting incoming traffic. And so, I know they work, especially for new bloggers now. But most importantly, right, this traffic, this SEO traffic has helped me earn a full time income. I now can, you know, spend more time with my loved ones.

[00:04:26.200] - Aisha
I can travel more, hopefully, when the world opens up because of this passive income I'm earning from my blog. Okay. And so, I honestly say SEO changed my life. It honestly changed my life. I can work less and spend more time with my loved ones and do things I love.

[00:04:41.540] - Aisha
And I want it to change yours, too, right? There's an opportunity for all of us. And so, I want SEO to change your life the way it changed mine. And I know what you're thinking because I've been there once. You're thinking this only happens to experienced bloggers.

[00:04:56.630] - Aisha
You're thinking, oh, I need to have a really established website. I need to have blogging for a long time. And I know you're also thinking it's too complicated. And trust me, I was there. I was there where you're sitting right now thinking, how do these bloggers get thousands of page views? How do they get into Mediavine, which is an advertising network.

[00:05:15.040] - Aisha
I was in that position in 2020 and look a year later, and I'm earning a full time income. So, I want you to know it is possible. And so, I'm going to teach you how. Okay. So, a bit of proof.

[00:05:26.940] - Aisha
So, here we go. What we have here is in September 2020. I was sitting at just over 7000 page views. Just seven months later, boom boom, nearly 100,000 page views. I'm so happy.

[00:05:41.380] - Aisha
And I just checked the last 30 days and we're sitting in over 140,000 pages. This should go up because I've published more content. So, this is majority SEO traffic, majority. And so, it's just amazing. Okay, so this is me when I was a lot thinner when I didn't put on weights.

[00:05:59.810] - Aisha
Okay, listen, we got 30 minutes here, 25 now, and dedicate this time to up scaling for yourself, block out all the distractions. Just give yourself 25 minutes to learn this skill, so you can implement it. Another thing is we have you know different types of people here, people coming from different walks of life with different capabilities. And we need to respect that and don't ever feel like you're asking a silly question. So that's a bit to learn, right?

[00:06:24.190] - Aisha
So, someone asked the question, you think that's a basic. It's okay. We all start somewhere. Okay.

[00:06:29.080] - Aisha
And so, let's all respect and grow together with our SEO knowledge. Now, what you're going to learn today? What are you going to learn today, right? So, give me a sec, I have my timer.

[00:06:39.910] - Aisha
I have a timer, so I don't go over. And so what we're going to learn today is this we're going to learn this three step formula that's going to get you SEO traffic. And I know it works because I tried it on all my sites and it's going to simplify the SEO process. So, you can focus on the right things. We already have a million and one things we need to do, right. And so, focusing on the right things every day will help moving forward.

[00:07:02.980] - Aisha
And also, there is no doubt that SEO traffic makes you more money. There is no doubt about that. Ask anybody. It brings me more ad revenue. I looked at the comparison between Pinterest traffic, social media traffic and SEO traffic.

[00:07:17.460] - Aisha
Display advertising networks pay way more for SEO traffic. I earn way more affiliate income. So, I'm sitting and I'm very fortunate that my blog now earns between 8-15,000 USD a month for the first blog. And that's from SEO traffic.

[00:07:31.620] - Aisha
And it's passive. It's more or less passive. You have to do the work now. But then once Google loves you and send you traffic, you can chat, right. And then also your site is way more valuable.

[00:07:41.030] - Aisha
If you want to sell your site one day, buyers love SEO traffic. It's just so much more valuable. So, if you're going to focus on one thing, focus on SEO traffic. Okay. So, I'm also going to throw in some bonus tips if we have time, because, listen, a lot of people here might be new bloggers. And I'm going to share some tips I use on my new sites to skyrocket the traffic, so I'm going to share that with you.

[00:08:04.600] - Aisha
And okay, let's get started. So, this is the formula. Please write this down and it sounds a bit basic but let me explain. The three step formula is this for SEO, you find a good SEO keyword, you've got it.

[00:08:19.270] - Aisha
Okay. You put that keyword in the right place, and then what you do is you supercharge that piece of content with secondary keywords. Now you might think this is a bit foreign language. I'll teach you how. So, if you're going to focus on SEO, these are the three step formally you need to follow.

[00:08:37.850] - Aisha
Find a good keyword. Put that keyword that you find in the right place, supercharge your content that you've just written with a primary keyword with secondary keywords. Okay, so let's step one, finding a good keyword. How do you find a good keyword? And I use this tool, this affordable tool.

[00:08:53.880] - Aisha
It's $17 a month. But you know let's make it easier for you because I get it. I was levied a broker before, right? Sometimes, we just don't have the budget to spend all this money on keywords tools, so it's $17 a month. The first month is free.

[00:09:08.280] - Aisha
I'm going to leave the link below. So, if you click on that and use this discount code Ksdisc, then the first month you'll get free. The second month is also 20% off. And so, you could probably do all your research in one month, the free time. If you need an extra month.

[00:09:23.950] - Aisha
Okay. Use a 20% discount. Boom. All your research done, content plan done for the year. Okay.

[00:09:29.640] - Aisha
And so, let me show you how this works. And so, finding a good keyword is this - people like to give their vague answers. I need data. I want someone to tell me, what do I need to be looking for? And I go for a keyword that has a search volume of more than 70 that has a competition score of less than 30.

[00:09:50.420] - Aisha
Now, the reason for this is there is absolutely no point writing about a topic that no one's looking for. That's the reality. You want to make money from your blog. And you want to get to the page one of Google and get search traffic. You talk about topics that people are actually looking for, right? And so that's number one. Number two is, and the mistake a lot of people make is they write about topics which are super popular, but there's big competition. And as a new blogger, it's very hard for you to rank for on page one when there's big brands on there that Google trust more. And so, it's a fine art, right.

[00:10:24.490] - Aisha
We need to find a keyword that sits in between them. And so how do you do that? And so, let me show you how you do that. So, I'm going to show you a real example of a topic I wrote about. So, let's imagine one of my menu items is digital nomad.

[00:10:37.450] - Aisha
Because I love traveling and working around the world. And so, Imagine you wanted to write about digital nomadism, right. So, I'll show you my key search.

[00:10:45.800] - Aisha
My back end. Okay. So, let me show you how key search works. Remember how I said search volume needs to be more than 70. This is the search volume.

[00:10:58.290] - Aisha
And that's the competition, search volume competition. So, step one, we put in the topic. Is the search volume more than 70, remember the rule? Yes, it's 60,500. You go oooh! You excited.

[00:11:11.830] - Aisha
Hang on. Remember, it needs to be a competition of less than 30. okay. So, we can see immediately this is a bad keyword. Now, just also to explain how keyword research works.

[00:11:24.340] - Aisha
Here are all the other articles ranking on page one. Okay. And so, we can see for sure like Investopedia, entrepreneur, whatever. All these articles, like their domain authority. So, how authorities of Google think they are, anything more than 30 is high.

[00:11:42.200] - Aisha
Okay, if there's no chance, as a new blogger, you're going to rank on page one because it's just a competitive topic. And so what I do to find a good keyword is I add keyword modifiers, which means, for example, let's say, so for example, hiking jackets. You know I'll wrap a hiking jacket, hiking jackets for women, hiking jackets for men, hiking jackets for teenagers, or best earphones for toddlers. And so, let's think you're modifying and making it more niche down and easier to rank for. Okay.

[00:12:14.080] - Aisha
So this is called a long tail keyword. They're longer. So, the keyword modifier I put in because I'm currently stuck in Malaysia, just because of Covid. And so, let's say this is not my Malaysia.

[00:12:28.990] - Aisha
Okay. So, you're thinking, so imagine I'm imagining you go through the keyword research. And so, let's step one. What's the search volume? Minimum 70.

[00:12:37.600] - Aisha
Okay. 70 competition score less than 30 is twelve. If you see a blue keyword, it's time to get really excited because it's very hard to find a blue keyword. Okay. And so, just have a look at the people on page one where we see out and beyond my site ranking on page one, even though my domain is pretty low. Right? And so, I actually targeted this keyword, and I'm ranking on page one because it's a good keyword. Right. And so let's just say, for example, you know you're fashion blogger. Let's say capsule orders.

[00:13:22.130] - Aisha
 Okay, straight away, step one. The keyword volume is more than 70. Okay. Hang on. Don't get excited.

[00:13:29.870] - Aisha
We need to look at the competition score. We can see the competition is way, way too high. It's going to be less than 30. Right. And so, this is the amazing thing about keyword research.

[00:13:38.620] - Aisha
It also shows you alternative keywords you can rank for. It doesn't work for you. And so, let's look here, here's a volume and here's a score. Right. We go down.

[00:13:48.730] - Aisha
We're like, okay. Okay, this, 2020 is nearly over. Maybe I wouldn't mind about that. Okay. Capsule order 2021, scores more than 30. Volume less than 70, bad keywords. But then we go down. Oh, this is exciting. Volume is 5400. Remember, it's going to be more 70.

[00:14:09.310] - Aisha
Okay, but let's check the competition. Competition is 21. This is a good topic. If you're a fashion blogger, capsule wardrobe men is a fantastic keyword. But then here's the thing, right.

[00:14:20.890] - Aisha
This is the great thing about key search. It gives you alternative. Listen, you could write a whole whole, this is your content plan done. Spring capsule wardrobe, winter capsule wardrobe, fall capsule wardrobe. You have so many ideas to write about.

[00:14:34.570] - Aisha
And these are good keywords. Okay, so that's how you find a good keyword. You put the keyword in, add a modifier and have a look if you can find a good keyword there. So, we're finding a keyword. We're celebrating and we're thinking we have the bees needs.

[00:14:49.810] - Aisha
But then let me go back to my screen. But the thing is right. It's quite important that you tell Google about that keyword. So, there's absolutely no point having a keyword keyword. Okay, tell Google about that keyword.

[00:15:03.760] - Aisha
We need to actually look at and tell Google that this is about digital nomad, Malaysia. And so, let, what you do, step two of the formula? Put that keyword that you found in the right place. And so what you do here. Here are all the places that you need to put that keyword. Okay.

[00:15:23.070] - Aisha
You need to tell Google what this article is about. So, you put that keyword in the H1 title, you put it in the subheading, you put it in the first hundred words, you sprinkle it throughout the post. You put it in the URL. Now image file name is when you know save an image and you put on your desktop file image one, file image two. Save it as that keywords.

[00:15:46.590] - Aisha
So, digital nomad, Malaysia. So, when WordPress or whatever webiste you use, they pull it. That keyword comes up in the file image into your site. You put it in the outset and the meta description. Now I'm going to show you practically exactly how this looks like.

[00:16:00.140] - Aisha
So. Let's imagine. So what I'm imagining is it actually happened. So, what happened was, I actually, let's look at the back end of one of my articles, digital nomad Malaysia. So, step one, this is the H1 title, right.

[00:16:12.990] - Aisha
H1. So, let's have a look, 1st 100 word.

[00:16:18.530] - Aisha
Have I sprinkled it? So, I put here. I put in the search digital Nomad in Malaysia. It's got 13 matches, meaning I've mentioned it a few times. So remember, we sprinkle it at the post.

[00:16:27.880] - Aisha
Have it in the H2. So, if you look here, didital nomad Malaysia, this is a H2. Okay. Is it in the URL? 

[00:16:36.520] - Aisha
So, let's have a look at the URL.

[00:16:40.050] - Aisha
Url slug, boom! Digital nomad Malaysia. Okay. Then is it in a meta description? A meta description is this, people, that was a meta description. Let's just say you Google something and this little description comes up.

[00:16:54.830] - Aisha
This is a meta description. This is a description of you're kind of enticing someone to click what the article is about. And so, we need a really good meta description. And so, let's look down. Okay. Meta description. Okay.

[00:17:13.940] - Aisha
Another thing is your alt text. Remember, the rule was in the file image, the alt text. So, here's the file image alt text. So, let's have a look here.

[00:17:25.310] - Aisha
So, let's find out what else I'll click on it.

[00:17:33.010] - Aisha
Okay. This is what you should do. Don't do this. Don't do what I'm doing here, digital nomad Malaysia even though I'm ranking on page one. You should have described the purpose of the image.

[00:17:40.630] - Aisha
We need to help people that are visually impaired, right? Digital nomad, maybe what I should do is an article, a flag about Malaysia and the articles about digital nomad Malaysia. Anyway, I put my keyword in the alternative text. Now, you might be thinking, oh my God, this is so much to remember.

[00:17:59.900] - Aisha
Okay, listen, let's make life easier for ourselves. And what I do is get the Yoast plugin.

[00:18:10.670] - Aisha
It's free. Do not pay, the paid one. I don't pay anything for Yoast because we gonna, you know let's keep things budget baby. So, upload Yoast as a plugin and put your focus keywords in here. And Yoast is so incredible.

[00:18:24.910] - Aisha
It tells you where to put the keyword. So, it says hello, please put it in the meta description, and it tells you all the problems in the thing. It says have you put it in the introduction? Great. Have you mentioned it enough time?

[00:18:36.240] - Aisha
Great. And if this is red, it will tell you. It will tell you, like, for example, this I need to improve, you know but it's still green overall. And so, Yoast suggests an easy way for you to put the keyword in the right place.

[00:18:48.850] - Aisha
Okay. So, remember rule, find a good keyword. You find a keyword, keyset. You put it in the right place in your article. You can use Yoast if you want.

[00:18:57.560] - Aisha
And the third formula. Third part of the formula is, let's have a look. You supercharge it with secondary keyword. Now a lot of people wonder, how is it this girl Aisha, she's you know, she hasn't been around for that long. How is she getting all this traffic?

[00:19:13.820] - Aisha
It's because, and my site doesn't have a high authority, right? I supercharge each piece of content with secondary keywords, which means I don't only rank for one keyword. I don't only rank for digital nomad Malaysia.

[00:19:26.310] - Aisha
I put in secondary keywords within my article. I'm going to show you an example, right? And so, you, first of all, how do you find secondary keywords? Keyword variations are like relevant keywords which are different to this topic. And so, I'm going to show an example.

[00:19:42.580] - Aisha
So, let's just say in keyset, right? Or capsule wardrobe, let's say digital nomad. Digital .. So, here are keyword variations over here. Okay. And so, digital nomad Malaysia is my primary keyword, we need to put those keywords in that place.

[00:20:12.330] - Aisha
Then I supercharge my content and I include digital nomad visa Malaysia. Malaysia digital nomad visa. I include digital nomad community, anything relevant to that. This tool is telling us these are relevant. And so, I include the ones which have you know maybe, that are 30, maybe 40 or less because they're lower competition.

[00:20:35.210] - Aisha
So, I include about 8 to 10. And so. If we look at this content here, I have supercharged... The stuff in yellow, I have supercharged it with alternative keywords, which means that when someone Googles digital Nomad accommodation, this article might come up. Okay. And so, we just supercharged the content with secondary keywords, so we can rank for those optimal keywords.

[00:20:57.090] - Aisha
And it's important for two reasons. One, it means that you can rank for additional keywords. Number two, it means that you are showing to Google what this topic is about. So, you need to put relevant keywords, so variations of the same topic, right, which you can find in keyword research.

[00:21:12.880] - Aisha
And it's saying to Google, this is what this article is about. You become the expert in that topic. And so, honestly, guys and girls, that is the three step formula I have followed for all my sites and all my articles, okay. And that's it, find a good keyword, put the keyword in the right place, supercharge each piece of content with relevant secondary keywords. You got that.

[00:21:33.630] - Aisha
Okay. Now listen, let's talk about bonuses, you know. Let's make this even easier and better for you. So, as a new site, you are probably struggling against other big sites out there that have been around for like so long. Like you know people, they're like, I get like, 100,000 views and I've been around for ten years.

[00:21:55.520] - Aisha
It's like, great. Good for you. But I haven't. So, how am I going to rank? And so, I'm going to teach you how. So, first of all, that was a really terrible American accent.

[00:22:05.610] - Aisha
I'm really sorry. I need to work on my accent. So, what I do for my pieces of content to make it more valuable and rank is I include a frequently asked questions section. Okay. Now I'm going to share an article that I got. This article I'm going to share was the first time I tasted SEO success.

[00:22:24.310] - Aisha
So after failing, failing, failing. When I included this FAQ and followed this three step formula into this article, I started to get Google traffic, significant Google traffic. And so, this is what I did. This particular article here.

[00:22:39.410] - Aisha
Non native English teacher jobs. Okay.

[00:22:47.970] - Aisha
Anyway, my point is I'm on page one. So, if we look here at beyond page one, right, we can see if we scroll to the bottom.

[00:22:59.650] - Aisha
I remember when I first started getting traffic to this. I see traffic. I think I cried. I was like, I think I practice. I finally got it.

[00:23:06.860] - Aisha
And it was so exciting. Okay, FAQ. So, we look here. I put on FAQs, but don't just include any FAQ. Include FAQs that Google tells us to include.

[00:23:18.590] - Aisha
And so, what you do is when you put in that keyword, right? Any topic you want to go for digital nomad Malaysia, I'll put it in this, whatever topic that you're going to try to rank for. Look here at people also ask, this is going to be your FAQ.

[00:23:37.460] - Aisha
Google is telling you people when they are Googling non native English teacher jobs, they are also looking for these topics. So, if you include it in your article, you are way more valuable than your competition chances are. And you are providing value to your reader and they'll stay around for longer.

[00:23:54.260] - Aisha
Okay. And this, if someone stays in your article for longer, it's a sign to Google that the content is good and they will rank you higher. So, as a new blogger please always include a section of, just include a few. You don't have to include all.

[00:24:07.200] - Aisha
Okay. So, in the people also asked section include at the bottom, put FAQ, write some of these questions. Answer them.

[00:24:12.800] - Aisha
Step one. Number two. Another bonus tip for you is article clusters. Now NNETJ is the article, non native English teacher jobs is the article that I have just shared with you.

[00:24:26.400] - Aisha
So, keyword clusters, right, is when you write a variety... No, topics which are within the same niche within the same cluster. So, for example, in this scenario, I wrote non native English teacher jobs, and I found alternative topics about online teaching, about teaching. And I wrote them. I wrote right at least five or six, and you will notice that your traffic will increase, especially as a new site, because as a new site, Google doesn't know what your authority is.

[00:24:54.710] - Aisha
And so, what I do is I write keyword clusters. So, let's just say you want to write about, okay, just now, for example, let's go to capsule wardrobe, right.

[00:25:10.450] - Aisha
And so, if you're a fashion blogger, I'm going to help you here. So, what you need to do is find the keyword cluster. So, I would write if I was a fashion blogger, I would do this, I'll write about.

[00:25:24.110] - Aisha
I'd write capsule wardrobe for men, topic one, winter capsule wardrobe, topic two, spring capsule wardrobe, topic three, minimalist capsule wardrobe, topic four. Honestly, there's so many. I would, plus size, oh my God, this is such a great niche. I would write these articles in a cluster, and it helps because it means your research time is like shortened. Write five or six in a cluster, interlink them.

[00:25:50.480] - Aisha
So, when I wrote about non native English jobs, I link to a relevant article on online teaching, and I linked between them. You create a cluster. And as a new site, if you do that, wow, you are going to notice that you will start to get significant Google traffic because Google trusts you as an authority for that topic. Okay. And so, remember, find a good keyword.

[00:26:12.350] - Aisha
Three step formula. Put it in the right place, supercharge it with secondary keywords. Bonus, add an FAQ and write a keyword cluster. Okay. So, conscious about time. So, pop quiz.

[00:26:27.410] - Aisha
First of all, question one, you should have written this down hopefully, what is a three step formula. If you leave this and say what will know everything but I know the three step formula. What is the three step formula to start getting Google traffic? Okay, that's question one.

[00:26:42.920] - Aisha
So, just you know reply in a chat. If you're watching this. Number two, when you're looking for a good keyword, what is the minimum search volume we aim for? There's a number right? There's a number I go for. What is the minimum search volume?

[00:26:57.120] - Aisha
Okay, you know it. Let me know. Number two, number three. It's like, what is the maximum competition score? So, it's not.

[00:27:05.780] - Aisha
Or minimum search volume and maximum competition score is what? What is it? Have a guess. Have a guess. Go back to the slide.

[00:27:16.380] - Aisha
I'm going to show my slides real quick. Oh, this is for Google. Boom. That's the answer. Okay, remember now what are the two bonus tips that are going to skyrocket your traffic as a new blogger?

[00:27:29.630] - Aisha
And this is especially, I mean, if you're an advanced blogger, definitely, you can still use this. But as a new blogger, this is especially important. Okay. Alright. So, now if you leave this session and you think, okay, I forgot what I need to do.

[00:27:40.720] - Aisha
Now, this is a step plan. I like people telling me practically what to do. Stop giving me theory. Just tell me what to do. So, if I were you and you were going to leave a session and you want to get Google traffic. Step one, click on the link below and get key search for free for the first month, you got it.

[00:27:56.080] - Aisha
Okay, start doing your keyword research. Try to find keyword research volume of more than 70, competitions for less than 30. Okay. So, you put the keyword modifiers, try and do the research mining. Okay, you put the keyword, a keyword. Great.

[00:28:13.190] - Aisha
Write your article. Put the keyword in the right place. Remember I told you all the H1, H2, first 100 words. You got that? You got that done.

[00:28:21.490] - Aisha
Okay, great. Now add secondary keywords. So, secondary keywords that I showed you how to find on the right side of key search. Add a few of those keyword variations in, you've done that. Okay.

[00:28:30.400] - Aisha
You're sitting there now with an article that has a primary keyword. It has keywords in all the right places and has a second keyword. Now what? Add an FAQ. Have you found the FAQ?

[00:28:40.630] - Aisha
You put it into Google and look at the people also ask section. You got it. Okay, so far, so good. Then what you do is you go back to key search and find a keyword cluster and write five to six articles relevant. They're going to be different but relevant.

[00:28:54.200] - Aisha
And so, capsule wardrobe for men, capsule wardrobe for women, capsule wardrobe for the summer, for the winter, for the fall. Right? Five or six. You got that, and interlink between them?

[00:29:03.150] - Aisha
Repeat, baby. Literally, repeat. That's what I do for all my sites and they get significant Google traffic. Okay, now. So, if you have any questions, please let me know, I'm more than happy to answer them, so you can mention them in the chat.

[00:29:17.060] - Aisha
Like, if you have any questions, more than happy to answer them. If you have any questions, do ask them. Now, let's talk about three things because the baby and it's free. It's for me. Give me the free stuff.

[00:29:27.550] - Aisha
Now, step one, I've created you a checklist because I know this particular section here where you're like, oh, wait up with the keyword. I don't know what your system makes sense. Don't worry. I've created you a free checklist. This checklist tells you all the right places that you need to find the keyword.

[00:29:44.760] - Aisha
So, look here. Where did I put that checklist? Should be along. What you got, you can see here. Basically, it hell you have you put the keyword in the H1 title?

[00:29:56.060] - Aisha
Have you put the keyword? It tells you all the places to put your keyword. And it's like a free checklist. You click on the link below, put in your email, and then you will immediately get this checklist. You can print out, put it on your wall, and you can like, just every time you write an article, just check it. Check. Check. Check.

[00:30:12.220] - Aisha
Okay. So, it's a simple checklist to help you put all your keywords in the right places and start getting full traffic. But also what I've got here for you is this. I know that a difficult part after this is, okay, so what's a good outline?

[00:30:29.210] - Aisha
How do I, what subheadings? What should I research for my topic? How do I write a piece of content that Google and my readers love? And so, I did create a mini course for you. And basically it train you to write the optimum blog post training.

[00:30:43.870] - Aisha
And if you get the Pro Pass, you get the Pro Pass, you actually get access to free. Right? So, get the Pro Pass. And this is what you learn in that. So, if we look here, I teach you, for example, telling you why you're so amazing because you are. You're amazing.

[00:31:00.430] - Aisha
The fact that you're spending your time listening to this upskilling. Listen, you're the 10% in the world. Okay? I talk about how to simplify SEO. I talk about actually going to more detail on how to find good keywords, how to create a good outline.

[00:31:14.610] - Aisha
A good outline is so important. I write about how to, what are the elements of good blog post should have? I give you three tools. I also teach you know some unique tips. I mean, where to put the keyword, how to SEO optimize it, and all the stuff I wish people told me. Because I know these experts, they don't share their knowledge.

[00:31:33.190] - Aisha
They don't truly share that. I mean, there's a lot of amazing people on the market. But just stuff that I've come across in my experience, you know I wish someone told me this. It would have made my life a lot easier. And finally, this for me, I think will be pretty useful because I actually give you an over the shoulder audit of a food blog post and a parenting blog post. They've written a blog post.

[00:31:53.830] - Aisha
They've implemented my tips, or maybe they haven't. And I shared how they can improve it to get more traffic. And so, if you get the Pro Pass, you will get access to that for free. Right? And so, I think that's pretty good bargain.

[00:32:08.410] - Aisha
And then what you also, okay, yeah. So, this is something you can download right now and get access to. This one, if you get the Pro Pass, you can get access to that, too. And finally, let's wrap it up.

[00:32:23.410] - Aisha
If you would like to ask me any of your questions, or maybe you're feeling a bit shy to ask now, and that's okay. I'm pretty active on Instagram. And if you would like to follow me on Instagram, it's Aisha Preece A-I-S-H-A-P-R-E-E-C-E. Just send me a cheeky DM. I always reply unless you're creepy, unless you send me something weird, like your feet picks or something up. I'm going to block you, right? But if you just look at me and say, I'm struggling with this, how can I do this?

[00:32:51.460] - Aisha
I always reply. And you're probably going to get loads of pics of me dancing with my cat you know. It's how I keep my son entertained. I share SEO and blogging tips every single day, more or less every single day. And if you're not on social media, that's fine.

[00:33:04.560] - Aisha
I respect that. You can drop me an email on Aisha@outandbeyond.com. Now I would love to hear from you.

[00:33:11.430] - Aisha
I would love to help support you in any way and start getting your Google traffic. I get it right. It's tough. We have a lot, and one things to do, we just need that break.

[00:33:22.220] - Aisha
So, yeah. Thank you so much for your time. I really appreciate you taking the time to listen to this. I hope it was useful.

[00:33:28.790] - Aisha
And just remember, you know just keep taking action. Just got to follow that formula. Repeat, repeat take action, and I'm here to support you either way. Okay, well, I'm going to stop sharing my screen. I'm going to wish you lots of luck.

[00:33:41.300] - Aisha
And I hope I wish you lots of success with your blog and take care. Thank you.

**Transcript:**
Liz Stapleton [00:00:00]:
Guys, welcome to today's session with Amanda Page, a writer and host of the Byline Breakthrough podcast. Actually, the breakthrough in her podcast is where I got the idea for Breakthrough in the Summit name and also of the Isle of Skye writing retreat. She is one of my favorite people to read. She's an incredible writer and to talk to. I met her many years ago.

Amanda Page [00:00:22]:
So.

Liz Stapleton [00:00:22]:
Amanda.

Amanda Page [00:00:23]:
Thank you. Oh, absolutely. Thanks for having me.

Liz Stapleton [00:00:26]:
Yeah. So I don't read a lot of email newsletters. I'm on a bunch. But yours I always read because they're always so personable.

Amanda Page [00:00:37]:
They're so good guys.

Liz Stapleton [00:00:38]:
Definitely join her email list. There's a link below. But so today we're going to be talking about writing content where we kind of are. Like, you need to post once a week or two times a week or three times a week if you're trying to grow. But you need to make it stand.

Amanda Page [00:00:53]:
Out because you were in the personal.

Liz Stapleton [00:00:56]:
Finance space, as am I, although technically I haven't written for it lately. And there's tons of personal finance blogs. How do you make it that people.

Amanda Page [00:01:05]:
Want to read your post on budget.

Liz Stapleton [00:01:08]:
Travel to Scotland or something, as opposed to someone else's? Let's start there is we're going to be talking about how to make writing.

Amanda Page [00:01:18]:
Content that anyone could write, but make.

Liz Stapleton [00:01:19]:
It uniquely you and something people can use.

Liz Stapleton [00:01:23]:
Right?

Liz Stapleton [00:01:23]:
Is that where we're going?

Amanda Page [00:01:24]:
Yeah, I think so.

Amanda Page [00:01:25]:
And I think a lot of advice.

Amanda Page [00:01:28]:
I see about writing on blogs is.

Amanda Page [00:01:33]:
Or depending on what your goal is for your blog

Amanda Page [00:01:42]:
Make it focused on the person reading. And I agree that you should have.

Amanda Page [00:01:48]:
An awareness of that and a focus on that. But the way you interpret that, I.

Amanda Page [00:01:54]:
Think, is really important. Is it I'm instructing them on something? Is it I'm trying to sell them on something? Is it I'm trying to make a connection with them? I think the answer should always be I'm trying to make a connection with them. And the way that we as humans connect is through personal stories.

Amanda Page [00:02:15]:
In terms of my budget travel to Scotland story, why would you read that instead and mine instead of someone else's one, I would say read them all. Right, read them all.

Amanda Page [00:02:30]:
But why you would want mine in.

Amanda Page [00:02:33]:
Particular would be how much do you.

Amanda Page [00:02:35]:
Connect to my story?

Amanda Page [00:02:37]:
So you would have to read.

Amanda Page [00:02:38]:
You'd have to kind of some of.

Amanda Page [00:02:42]:
My job in that, I think, is to make sure that I have a.

Amanda Page [00:02:45]:
Compelling headline or title that can get.

Amanda Page [00:02:50]:
Real overwhelming real quick, too. When you start to look at, I know if any beginners are on listening.

Amanda Page [00:02:55]:
Now, there are headline evaluators and different.

Amanda Page [00:03:01]:
Tools to use, and I found those incredibly frustrating and overwhelming.

Amanda Page [00:03:06]:
And they would gum up the wheels, to be honest.

Amanda Page [00:03:10]:
I would start to use them, and then I would not write posts that I couldn't get the perfect title for, even though it would have been really connective content or something that I was really working through or a really vulnerable.

Amanda Page [00:03:22]:
Post that people probably really would have.

Amanda Page [00:03:26]:
Liked to have seen. Because that's another kind of key.

Amanda Page [00:03:32]:
In this puzzle.

Liz Stapleton [00:03:35]:
Puzzle that is blogging that have a never ending amount of pieces yeah.

Amanda Page [00:03:42]:
Is to really make sure that you're also being vulnerable. I mean, that's another way to connect with your audience and tell vulnerable stories, then.

Amanda Page [00:03:49]:
And that's probably where, I think, obviously.

Amanda Page [00:03:52]:
In my budget, travel to Scotland story.

Amanda Page [00:03:56]:
You would have to know that I.

Amanda Page [00:03:59]:
Didn'T have anything to do. So I asked friends, what should I do in Scotland? Someone suggested I go to Skye. I went to Skye and made a.

Amanda Page [00:04:08]:
Friend on the way and they suggested.

Amanda Page [00:04:10]:
I would be back. So there's story there, right? Like, there's story there and everything I write about it then is going to come from that place.

Liz Stapleton [00:04:20]:
Yeah. And I think you're not telling....I think when you're writing blog posts, yes, you need to have story. That's what we're talking about. We'll get to list posts and how to use in a minute.

Amanda Page [00:04:27]:
But your story isn't just like, oh.

Liz Stapleton [00:04:29]:
You'Re telling a story, tell a story. Right, I'm telling a story and then I'm pulling out the bits that are kind of universal.

Amanda Page [00:04:37]:
Right.

Liz Stapleton [00:04:37]:
It's like the more specific a story is, the more universal elements there are to it. I think you see that in movies and TV shows and stuff, like, you're obsessed with The Witcher right now and Game of Thrones and Dragons Don't Exist. But the tension of fighting with your siblings, I mean, obviously not, but there's universal truth even in the craziest things. And so pulling out the universal truth.

Liz Stapleton [00:05:05]:
Of your story so that someone can take it and apply it to their own.

Amanda Page [00:05:09]:
Yeah, absolutely. Like connecting to the elements in the.

Amanda Page [00:05:12]:
Story that you're going to recognize or.

Liz Stapleton [00:05:15]:
The lessons you learned. Because anyone can write a how to get out of debt post.

Liz Stapleton [00:05:20]:
Right. But it's, hey, this is how I got out of debt, and these are some mistakes I made.

Liz Stapleton [00:05:28]:
Here's how I think I could have done better.

Liz Stapleton [00:05:25]:
You're telling your story, but you're also giving them action steps so you can marry the sort of helpfulness in the Story, which makes it more people would want to read that, I feel like.

Amanda Page [00:05:42]:
Yeah, I think so. I mean, I think anytime you can contextualize anything, it's going to be a win. And I think that what you're saying with trying to find the universal elements in a story.

Amanda Page [00:05:53]:
There are storytelling structures like the hero's.

Amanda Page [00:05:59]:
Journey or things like that, that we can look at. And I think that to break it down into blog posts, you can think about your journey that way.

Amanda Page [00:06:10]:
And then what's each individual post on the way on this journey right.

Amanda Page [00:06:16]:
So then you're telling individual stories.

Amanda Page [00:06:18]:
But the overarching thing is the universal thing.

Amanda Page [00:06:22]:
Because, I mean, my story of getting out of debt, it's never just a get out of debt story right there's. How I got in debt story, who I was at the time of the.

Amanda Page [00:06:31]:
Debt, how long I had the debt.

Amanda Page [00:06:32]:
What it was doing in my life. Like, there are all those pieces and there's a story or several stories for.

Liz Stapleton [00:06:38]:
Each, the breaking point of you have.

Amanda Page [00:06:40]:
To get rid of it. Yeah, 100%.

Amanda Page [00:06:44]:
And I think that's what people are looking for is like, what was finally the tipping point? What was the breakthrough that got you to that point? What did you really have to focus on? And I think that there are valuable moments in real time journeys, which is how I was writing mine for Dream Beyond Debt. At the time when we met in the personal finance space, I had no idea what I was doing, what was happening. It was like, I'm just trying to get out of this $48,000 of debt, and I want to do it in this time frame. But especially now, a few years later.

Amanda Page [00:07:22]:
After I've paid off that debt, it's.

Amanda Page [00:07:24]:
Really valuable to go back and look.

Amanda Page [00:07:26]:
At that journey and see where the universal elements really are.

Liz Stapleton [00:07:32]:
Yeah. So you don't have to be writing.

Amanda Page [00:07:34]:
From a place of I'm teaching you.

Liz Stapleton [00:05:37]:
You can be writing from a place of I'm sharing. As I figure it out, you're not alone.

Amanda Page [00:07:42]:
Yes, I think that's highly valuable, and.

Amanda Page [00:07:46]:
I think that's really where a lot of the success comes in. I mean, I know especially back in the day when mom blogs were starting or design blogs and all the sewing.

Amanda Page [00:08:02]:
Blogs, those connections, although there was always.

Amanda Page [00:08:08]:
An element of this is how I.

Amanda Page [00:08:09]:
Do this, those connections were really also.

Amanda Page [00:08:12]:
About, hey, I'm a woman who enjoys this too. So it's just sharing stories.

Amanda Page [00:08:17]:
It wasn't even about like, let's all monetize.

Liz Stapleton [00:08:21]:
Yeah, because there is a lot of focus of let's all monetize. And yes, we're going to talk about monetization in the Summit too.

Amanda Page [00:08:29]:
Right.

Liz Stapleton [00:08:29]:
Because blogging is work, and I fully believe you should get paid for your hard work. It may take time.

Amanda Page [00:08:35]:
It's not thing when it comes to.

Liz Stapleton [00:07:46]:
Blogging, but you need to write this kind of post and monetize it this way, and there's a lot out there like that. And you had mentioned before we started.Recording the how to post or the listicles. Do you want to kind of share.

Liz Stapleton [00:08:54]:
Your thoughts on that again?

Amanda Page [00:08:56]:
Yes, I do. Very badly. So, again, when I was just starting.

Amanda Page [00:09:02]:
And I was reading about, like, I.

Amanda Page [00:09:06]:
Was reading around in the personal finance space and there were several posts about how to monetize, and then anytime that you start to think about maybe turning something into a business, you're going to.

Amanda Page [00:09:16]:
Go read how to turn this into a business. And you're going to see a lot.

Amanda Page [00:09:22]:
Of how to write these headlines, how to write copy, how to write customer focused posts that sell and it can.

Amanda Page [00:09:30]:
Get really overwhelming really quickly and it is a particular skill to develop in.

Amanda Page [00:09:37]:
Order to write those kinds of posts.

Amanda Page [00:09:39]:
But also if you don't have anything.

Amanda Page [00:09:42]:
To sell from the beginning, I wasn't trying to sell my story, I didn't have a product. I wasn't even really trying to sell the blog. Right. If you don't have anything to sell or if you're not particularly in the.

Amanda Page [00:09:55]:
Headspace to be sold.

Amanda Page [00:09:59]:
Customer focused content isn't really going to be connective for your audience. There's plenty out there too on how to do both, like how to make a post that is connective and.

Amanda Page [00:09:58]:
cost effective and will sell you on a product or a service. But really, those things get tiresome very quickly. I can't tell you how many I've seen on like 15 side hustles you've never heard of. And then you go on and it's the same damn hustles that we've been talking about for ten years. I've heard of these and I know people who have done them and those stories are terrible. So maybe like seeking out those kinds of personal stories, you might look at a list like that and it's like, sure, but.

Amanda Page [00:10:57]:
I'm not going to invest my time, my energy, or my money.

Liz Stapleton [00:10:54]:
Go back to that resource again. throw out junk. Yeah, exactly.

Amanda Page [00:11:09]:
Junk is one way to think about it, for sure.

Amanda Page [00:11:13]:
Because when I was heavily into the personal finance space, I probably read 15 blog blogs a day, right.

Amanda Page [00:11:25]:
I was in there. I was in a particularly small community of women who were in student loan debt or just a nice really small niche and.

Amanda Page [00:11:44]:
But I was still reading.

Amanda Page [00:11:46]:
These posts and that's a lot to read in a day, right? And I would read those daily and just kind of stay on top of that community and be engaged with that community. You don't build community with lists or like really thin how to's you build.

Amanda Page [00:12:04]:
Community with stories of vulnerability from your.

Amanda Page [00:12:07]:
Own life that you are sharing with.

Amanda Page [00:12:09]:
Other people who are also interested in doing something similar as to what you're doing.

Liz Stapleton [00:11:08]:
Yeah. And as you said, you can marry that. You can have a listicle do.

Amanda Page [00:12:23]:
Well, so long as it's got the.

Liz Stapleton [00:12:23]:
Story, the personal element to it. But you can't have a listicle without story. You can have a story without a listicle.

Amanda Page [00:12:31]:
But for those types of posts to really succeed, you need to have a.

Liz Stapleton [00:12:38]:
Personal element to it that makes it stand out. That doesn't just make it I think.

Amanda Page [00:12:43]:
It'S a matter of when you're doing.

Liz Stapleton [00:12:45]:
A blog and you're hearing all these posting schedules and there's some truth to it, like you want to post consistently, right? But I would rather consistently do once a month something good and quality. And I'm not talking like good quality, 3000 words, perfectly SEO optimized. I mean, yes, that's great too, but.

Liz Stapleton [00:12:29]:
Something quality as opposed to quantity when it comes to blogs, because if they.

Amanda Page [00:13:11]:
Come to your site and it's a.

Liz Stapleton [00:13:10]:
Come to your site and it's a post that's just that I need to get something out and it's not very helpful or good or have a story.

Amanda Page [00:13:18]:
They're not going to come back.

Liz Stapleton [00:13:22]:
But if every single one of your.

Amanda Page [00:13:24]:
Posts has something in there, a story, I think it's far more compelling.

Liz Stapleton [00:13:20]:
You're going to want to go back like you said you did, like 15 blogs. I did. I had like a bookmark folder of personal finance sites that I would go look.

Amanda Page [00:13:37]:
Did they do a new post yet?

Liz Stapleton [00:13:39]:
Yeah, absolutely. Yeah.

Amanda Page [00:13:37]:
I was waiting to hear from my friends. That's how it felt. Just thinking about that schedule, to that posting schedule. I mean, when I started Dream Beyond. Debt, I was posting three times a.

Liz Stapleton [00:13:52]:
Debt, I was posting three times a.

Amanda Page [00:13:54]:
Week, which seems crazy to me now, but also I wasn't worried about SEO optimization. I was just like, here's my story.

Amanda Page [00:13:53]:
It was much easier to think about. . Yeah.

Liz Stapleton [00:14:03]:
Stories are easier to write. When you're trying to do the perfect post for computers, which is what that is. And yeah, you want to have some SEO optimization, you don't have to go over the top. There's some basics. It doesn't have to be insanely hard. Then you're writing for computer, not for the people that will return.

Amanda Page [00:14:25]:
Right?

Liz Stapleton [00:14:25]:
So you may get fresh people in, but the ones that return, they're going.

Amanda Page [00:14:30]:
To be the ones that when you.

Liz Stapleton [00:14:23]:
To be the ones that when you do finally get to a point of you're like, guys, I've struggled with this because you've written about your story, you're.

Amanda Page [00:14:33]:
You'Re like, guys, I've struggled with this because you've written about your story, you're.

Liz Stapleton [00:14:36]:
Like, I found this tool and it is changing my life, They're going to be like, bought, done.

Amanda Page [00:14:40]:
They're going to be like, bought, done.

Liz Stapleton [00:14:44]:
Or I created this. They're the fans.

Amanda Page [00:14:47]:
I think you don't need a ton.

Liz Stapleton [00:14:41]:
I think you don't need a ton of traffic to be successful as a blogger. And I feel like if you're only writing for a computer, that's the only thing you're going after.

Amanda Page [00:14:54]:
Yeah, agreed.

Amanda Page [00:14:58]:
I don't pay attention to SEO or any of that stuff right now, and I'm so much happier. And I know that I'm not blogging on such a regular schedule, but I do have my website and your newsletter.

Liz Stapleton [00:15:10]:
Is regular and it's always really good.

Liz Stapleton [00:15:12]:
Thank you.

Liz Stapleton [00:14:54]:
But you're building that community that those loyal fans, I think Pat Flynn calls them superfans, right? Something like that. They'll make a bigger difference. I've had high traffic, I got less.

Amanda Page [00:15:28]:
At more wine, up to a pretty.

Liz Stapleton [00:15:30]:
Good place, and I was really excited about it, but it wasn't actually earning.

Amanda Page [00:15:33]:
That much and I kind of stepped.

Liz Stapleton [00:15:35]:
Back from it and I looked at some other things and I focused on my other site. And this last year, I started doing less. I was like, I'm not doing social media.

Liz Stapleton [00:15:42]:
I'm not.

Liz Stapleton [00:15:43]:
I tried YouTube out for a while and I enjoyed it and I value it, but I was like, you know what, it's getting to be too much and having do videos preventing me from putting out posts. And you know what happened? So 2018, I made that decision.

Amanda Page [00:15:57]:
2019, I had more product sales than.

Liz Stapleton [00:16:00]:
I ever had on my site.

Amanda Page [00:16:02]:
My traffic went down, but I had.

Liz Stapleton [00:15:27]:
My traffic went down, but I had. A better sort of I feel more connected to my audience. I had a better conversion. Yeah. I've had my highest self employed income in 2019.

Amanda Page [00:16:13]:
Yeah, I see that.

Amanda Page [00:16:20]:
And I was just reading a newsletter today, I think about that, that people think that you need big lists or that really it's just a few people, and that service businesses, too. And really a blog, I think, kind of exists in the beginning as a service business.

Amanda Page [00:16:38]:
Easy.

Liz Stapleton [00:16:40]:
Yeah.

Amanda Page [00:16:41]:
That those are harder to build, but they're also harder to build than product.

Amanda Page [00:16:48]:
Businesses, but.

Amanda Page [00:16:18]:
They're more scalable later, and.

Amanda Page [00:16:52]:
They're more like, that's not it.

Liz Stapleton [00:16:58]:
I feel like it's the other way around.

Amanda Page [00:16:59]:
Product businesses are harder to build, but.

Liz Stapleton [00:17:01]:
Are more scalable, service based businesses, easier to start.

Amanda Page [00:16:54]:
Easier to start, hard to scale.

Liz Stapleton [00:17:08]:
Yeah, because you can only work with so many clients.

Amanda Page [00:17:12]:
Right.

Liz Stapleton [00:17:12]:
And I've run into that, and then you're like, okay, well, do I want to start an agency? And it's like, no, I don't.

Amanda Page [00:17:18]:
Yeah, no, but you've worked with clients, so you know what clients need. You could create a course on how to serve this client.

Liz Stapleton [00:17:24]:
Yeah.

Amanda Page [00:17:24]:
So there's lots of ways to I mean, I don't think offering a service.

Liz Stapleton [00:16:57]:
So there's lots of ways to I mean, I don't think offering a service through your blog to kind of try to make money to get that more.

Amanda Page [00:17:31]:
To make money to get that more.

Liz Stapleton [00:17:31]:
Flexible lifestyle, which I feel a lot of people look turn to blogging, too. I don't think there's anything wrong from that. I think you can learn a lot from it, but eventually some people love.

Amanda Page [00:17:39]:
From it, but eventually some people love.

Liz Stapleton [00:17:40]:
Doing client based business, and that's what they do, and that's great. But for me, I was like, I.

Amanda Page [00:17:44]:
They do, and that's great. But for me, I was like, I.

Liz Stapleton [00:17:46]:
Don't, I'm finding it hard to, like take a vacation because I have especially.

Amanda Page [00:17:48]:
Take a vacation because I have especially.

Liz Stapleton [00:17:51]:
The services I offered doing Pinterest management. I'm like, Well, I've got to do all the scheduling. I've got to do it's a consistent thing, which is great, consistent income. But it was hard. I was like, I really had to work hard to get ahead so that I could then take time off to go on vacation.

Amanda Page [00:18:07]:
Right.

Amanda Page [00:18:09]:
I think some of that too comes in. What you want your blog to do? Like, I didn't start a blog thinking, oh, I'm going to make a ton of money.

Amanda Page [00:18:18]:
Right?

Amanda Page [00:18:18]:
I was thrilled when I got $300 for a sponsored post, and I was never making I never had the tons of traffic. When I got to $100 in my Google Ad revenue, I was like, Whoa, that was a big deal. I was blogging to stay accountable, to.

Amanda Page [00:18:39]:
Pay off the debt at first, and.

Amanda Page [00:18:41]:
Then I was blogging to stay engaged with the community. And I think that is important to keep in mind. A lot of blogs are existing as a marketing piece of the business, and.

Amanda Page [00:18:56]:
I think that's a shift in the mindset or the way that those writers.

Amanda Page [00:19:03]:
Of those posts are looking at the audience, like to sell to. But it's the same thing, I think.

Amanda Page [00:19:10]:
That you're not going to sell unless you're sharing a story.

Liz Stapleton [00:19:17]:
Okay.

Liz Stapleton [00:17:49]:
Because the aim of the Summit is to be really kind of action oriented. So we're like, you've got to do stories.

Amanda Page [00:19:22]:
So we're like, you've got to do stories.

Liz Stapleton [00:19:23]:
Do you have any thoughts on sort. Of how to kind of figure out.

Amanda Page [00:19:26]:
Of how to kind of figure out.

Liz Stapleton [00:19:27]:
What stories to tell or how to kind of go about having a consistent editorial calendar, whether that's once a week.

Amanda Page [00:19:30]:
Kind of go about having a consistent editorial calendar, whether that's once a week.

Liz Stapleton [00:19:36]:
Three times, once a month, whatever, where you're doing stories? Because it's kind of a catch 22, right, is blogging can take over your life, but then you're not really living life, and then you don't really have as many stories. So thoughts on sort of that, I guess.

Amanda Page [00:19:49]:
So thoughts on sort of that, I guess.

Amanda Page [00:19:52]:
Yeah, I have lots of thoughts on that as well. One of them is just to kind of train your mind. When I was posting three times a.

Amanda Page [00:19:58]:
Week, I was always kind of looking at life through the lens of, is this shareable?

Amanda Page [00:20:06]:
Is this something interesting?

Liz Stapleton [00:20:07]:
And also talk to your people.

Amanda Page [00:20:10]:
And by your people, I mean your friends and family. You know when a story is bad.

Amanda Page [00:20:14]:
And you know when it lands and.

Amanda Page [00:20:15]:
If it's landing with your people, it'll land with your audience. It's a lot like the way that live storytellers or comedians work sometimes. Like, you've got to kind of try out your material. So talk to your people.

Liz Stapleton [00:20:32]:
And then.

Amanda Page [00:19:50]:
And then. Just give yourself some space to train.

Amanda Page [00:20:35]:
Your mind to start looking for the.

Amanda Page [00:20:38]:
Stories in your life. And one way to do that is.

Amanda Page [00:20:41]:
Just to start, like journaling or even.

Amanda Page [00:20:44]:
Better, just making lists of the stories that you already think might be interesting.

Amanda Page [00:20:51]:
And I know epic, they don't, they.

Amanda Page [00:20:33]:
Don't need to be epic. They can be tiny. They could be tiny. You can have three stories in one thing. Like it's these three things happened. And altogether, I think they mean this.

Amanda Page [00:21:04]:
Right, like boom post.

Amanda Page [00:21:07]:
You just have to start looking at your life through that lens.

Amanda Page [00:21:12]:
For sure, and keeping track.

Liz Stapleton [00:21:14]:
So having like a pen and paper or just making notes in your phone wherever you are, having a place to when you get an idea about something.

Amanda Page [00:21:23]:
And how it can play out on your blog, write it down.

Liz Stapleton [00:21:26]:
And you may not use all of them, and that's okay, but the more you have, the easier it is.

Amanda Page [00:21:02]:
Oh, yeah, and I still have, like I still come across lists of titles for things for Dream Beyond Debt that I never used, still happening for my weekly prompt. And those are interesting. I don't have an editorial calendar for those. I do have a list of things I would like. Here's some subjects that I want to touch on, but those are really coming from my life in the week that I'm writing them. And I know a lot of people batch your work and do that stuff, and maybe I'll get to that point someday. But really, I'm talking to my audience.

Amanda Page [00:22:01]:
About like, hey, is this stuff happening.

Amanda Page [00:22:05]:
For you guys now, too? My last one was what I'm going to be available for this year. It's really about setting boundaries. And it's like, I guarantee that other people are thinking about what boundaries do I need to set? Because I've been talking to my people. We're all talking about that.

Liz Stapleton [00:22:19]:
Yeah, exactly. Because I do like editorial calendars, but I am sometimes flying by the seat of my pants.

Amanda Page [00:22:27]:
But.

Liz Stapleton [00:22:29]:
I feel like an editorial calendar makes it easier to fly by the seat of your pants because you've got, like, a fallback. So you can take those ideas that you've had and put them into an editorial calendar and then not use it. Be like, I actually want to write this post this week, even though it was slated for three weeks from now, or whatever, or actually this happened this week, and I think that makes more sense to do.

Amanda Page [00:22:52]:
Yeah, I think that's really important to think about. It's helpful to write out a list.

Amanda Page [00:22:58]:
Like, you can just write out 52 subjects.

Amanda Page [00:23:01]:
Right. And that is a way to start training your mind to think through this lens. So those subjects, what stories do I have about these subjects? Or if you've got titles in mind, like 52 is one a week for the entire year, and that's kind of a good benchmark to start with. And then it's a way to start.

Amanda Page [00:23:21]:
Thinking about it through the lens. Yeah, because it's just training your brain.

Liz Stapleton [00:22:00]:
So blogging is a whole skill set. So training your brain to be a storyteller, even if you're not naturally a storyteller.

Amanda Page [00:23:33]:
So training your brain to be a storyteller, even if you're not naturally a storyteller.

Liz Stapleton [00:23:36]:
Because I am not naturally a storyteller at all. I'm really bad at telling stories, actually. But the beauty no, I am, though. I feel like the beauty of blogging is you can write out a draft where you tell the story and you're like, whoa, that is really bad. Let me clean this up. You can find the good parts in it and clean it up and take out what's extra and not really necessary. And that's kind of the wonderful thing of playing around with it and testing.

Amanda Page [00:23:59]:
Out what's extra and not really necessary. And that's kind of the wonderful thing of playing around with it and testing.

Liz Stapleton [00:24:07]:
It is you become a better writer.

Amanda Page [00:24:10]:
The more you do it.

Amanda Page [00:24:11]:
Yeah, I think it's really important to note, too, to just kind of play it first. Otherwise you're going to suck the joy right out of it. If you put too much pressure on the post in the beginning, you're not.

Amanda Page [00:24:23]:
Going to create some kind of some.

Liz Stapleton [00:24:25]:
Of my very first posts. It's like if you don't look back at your very first post, like a year or two from now and cringe, you have not been writing enough.

Amanda Page [00:24:35]:
Oh, yeah.

Amanda Page [00:24:36]:
When I look back at my first couple of Dream Beyond Debt once or even the first three months, I'm like, who.

Amanda Page [00:24:40]:
I mean, who.

Amanda Page [00:24:45]:
I was teaching.

Liz Stapleton [00:24:46]:
Delete them later too, guys. Or just go back and redo them and then republish them.

Amanda Page [00:24:52]:
Well, and I should say that too. There are tons of resources. I mean, I teach live storytelling in a course and narrative structure, so there's.

Amanda Page [00:25:02]:
Plenty of that out there.

Amanda Page [00:25:04]:
If you think, oh, I'm a terrible storyteller. Well, there are tips. There are tips. And I can leave many resources in the notes on this because.

Liz Stapleton [00:25:16]:
They'Re good.

Amanda Page [00:24:06]:
They're good t hings to keep in mind.

Liz Stapleton [00:25:21]:
Yeah, absolutely. The best thing is blogging. Nothing really permanent, so just tell the story, hit, publish, think of your next one or your next list with a story element to it and keep going because the more you do it, the better you'll get. And you can always go if you are strapped for time, instead of throwing out a junk post, go back to one of your very first ones, read it, cringe a little bit, and then be like, hey, how can I make this better? And then republish that. Because at least there's a personable element to it that a junk post of 15 side hustles that everyone has in.

Amanda Page [00:25:57]:
Fact heard of is not going to do. Yeah, those posts make me sad.

Amanda Page [00:26:06]:
Junk posts make me sad.

Liz Stapleton [00:26:08]:
Yeah, so don't create junk.

Amanda Page [00:26:11]:
I know you're here because you are.

Liz Stapleton [00:25:17]:
I know you're here because you are here because you're a quality blogger that wants to build content, because you do, literally. She is a professor, guys, at a school where she teaches writing.

Amanda Page [00:26:24]:
So.

Liz Stapleton [00:26:27]:
As a teacher, what are things you see people struggle with when it comes to writing that could maybe help.

Amanda Page [00:26:33]:
Especially oh, goodness, getting started. The drafting process. No one wants to go through that.

Amanda Page [00:26:38]:
Process.

Amanda Page [00:26:41]:
And there's no avoiding it. But one thing that I will say about the drafting process and blogging is.

Amanda Page [00:26:49]:
That all of my blog posts were first drafts.

Amanda Page [00:26:54]:
And I can see even and I meant to do this a long time ago, but I can see there are.

Amanda Page [00:27:00]:
Like three posts that I have that.

Amanda Page [00:27:02]:
You can see me working out the same idea and what the final product was.

Amanda Page [00:27:10]:
And I think that can exist in.

Amanda Page [00:27:13]:
A blog, but it can also exist. You've got to give yourself time for the drafting process and that can include brainstorming outlining all that. Just what structure do I want this to adhere to? What's a great first line.

Amanda Page [00:27:28]:
All that doesn't come straight from the beginning.

Liz Stapleton [00:27:32]:
Give yourself permission to just write a crappy.

Amanda Page [00:27:34]:
Yeah, absolutely.

Amanda Page [00:27:38]:
The other thing that I think I see a lot of struggle with is integration of outside material, like just attributing to other people. Although I tell a lot of personal stories, I make a ton of references.

Amanda Page [00:27:51]:
In my work and I think that.

Amanda Page [00:26:22]:
It's important just to be like, hey, according to so and so, according to so and so, or I read once on this blog that it's just, like throwing out casual references. There's a way to do that that's.

Amanda Page [00:28:05]:
Not academic and kind of boring.

Liz Stapleton [00:28:09]:
Yeah, I got the idea to use breakthrough from you, and I reached out to you. I was like, Is it okay if I do that? And you were like, yeah, absolutely. I'm so upset. I had, like, perfect lighting because it was, like, rainy, but it was, like, light, and now the sun came out in the blind. But anyway and it's okay if you've.

Amanda Page [00:28:30]:
Been just don't steal.

Liz Stapleton [00:28:04]:
Been just don't steal. We've got copyright and stuff being covered in another session, but throw attribute people.

Amanda Page [00:28:40]:
Where it's a full attribute stats or.

Liz Stapleton [00:28:35]:
Where it's a full attribute stats or information that helps support your point or your idea. It just makes it that much more credible. And that is stuff Google likes. You don't have to write a scientific paper in order to do that.

Amanda Page [00:28:53]:
Paper in order to do that.

Liz Stapleton [00:28:53]:
And I definitely recommend you guys go read some of Amanda's stuff to better see, because I think she does things so good.

Amanda Page [00:28:58]:
Read some of Amanda's stuff to better see, because I think she does things so good.

Liz Stapleton [00:29:04]:
I look forward to her emails, even though she really does aim more towards people who are writers. And I'm a blogger and I write, but I don't necessarily consider myself a writer. I have been one. I used to freelance.

Amanda Page [00:29:17]:
Right.

Liz Stapleton [00:29:17]:
Obviously.

Amanda Page [00:29:17]:
Yeah. I don't understand that.

Liz Stapleton [00:29:19]:
But I don't tend to think of myself as a writer because I was a math major. I have a math degree, not English.

Amanda Page [00:29:34]:
But I love her emails because the.

Liz Stapleton [00:29:01]:
But I love her emails because the stories and they're applicable to, like even though I'm not thinking about it in a writing sense, I'm thinking about it in more of a business sense or in a client sense or whatever.

Liz Stapleton [00:29:47]:
They'Re.

Liz Stapleton [00:29:42]:
They're fantastic examples of how do you connect. Even if it's not even the same subject. Thank you.

Amanda Page [00:29:51]:
Even if it's not even the same subject. Thank you.

Amanda Page [00:29:56]:
Yeah, I think of my emails kind of as personal development for writers. But writing, it is so broad. Right? It's so broad. And I think about it in terms.

Amanda Page [00:30:08]:
Of I mean, I know a lot.

Amanda Page [00:30:10]:
Of people who wouldn't consider themselves writers who are making their living as a writer, you know what I mean? Hold on, where does this come from?

Amanda Page [00:30:18]:
Like, deep, deep cultural conditioning.

Amanda Page [00:30:24]:
Yeah, I have a sense of who.

Amanda Page [00:30:27]:
My audience is just, again, from growing.

Amanda Page [00:30:31]:
The list and talking to people and asking for replies.

Liz Stapleton [00:29:52]:
Go to conferences, talking to people, talking to them. You and I met at a conference, the first Blogging conference I ever went to.

Amanda Page [00:30:45]:
And here we are, like five, six, five years later ish I was like, when was that?

Liz Stapleton [00:30:44]:
And here we are, like five, six, five years later ish I was like, when was that? And you're still someone I go to. I'm like, hey, what do you think of this idea? It can really help because sometimes your audience is like, lurkers and they're not actually talking yet. So talking to other people, bloggers even.

Amanda Page [00:31:10]:
Can really help in terms of getting.

Liz Stapleton [00:31:07]:
Can really help in terms of getting. Those ideas or just bouncing off because you can get.

Amanda Page [00:31:17]:
So stuck in just a debate with.

Liz Stapleton [00:31:15]:
So stuck in just a debate with yourself and then you ask the one they're like. Yeah, that one easy decision made.

Amanda Page [00:31:27]:
So, yeah, go to conferences, go hang.

Liz Stapleton [00:31:23]:
So, yeah, go to conferences, go hang out with other people at the summit.

Amanda Page [00:31:31]:
Right. We're going to have some sort of.

Liz Stapleton [00:31:30]:
Right. We're going to have some sort of Community group for you guys during the summit. But the comments section of these two can be a great way to connect and get ideas and ask questions like we started out. It always comes back to what story are you telling with whatever piece of content that makes it different from all the other blogs in the same topic as you.

Amanda Page [00:31:55]:
Yeah, and I think that's important too.

Amanda Page [00:32:00]:
To say, read widely. I was reading 15 blogs a day, and not always the same. Like the next day. It might be 15 more.

Amanda Page [00:32:10]:
The personal finance sphere is very large.

Amanda Page [00:32:14]:
Yeah, but read widely and connect widely. I was making a point in the beginning to comment on two blogs a day. Sometimes it'd be more, but always two.

Amanda Page [00:32:28]:
And to make those.

Liz Stapleton [00:32:31]:
I would only.

Amanda Page [00:31:59]:
I would only comment on the stories that I was connected to and it wasn't hard to find two of those a day. But yeah, read widely I think is important too, just so you have things.

Amanda Page [00:32:42]:
To reference and that also helps you.

Amanda Page [00:32:46]:
You just kind of like organically start to understand story structure and how to do this better.

Amanda Page [00:32:51]:
Yeah. So if you got writer's block, you're struggling looking at a blank page, go read something.

Liz Stapleton [00:32:40]:
Yeah. So if you got writer's block, you're struggling looking at a blank page, go read something. Yeah. Never fail.

Amanda Page [00:33:01]:
Yeah, absolutely. Read.

Liz Stapleton [00:33:04]:
Don't watch. That's a little bit different because you're.

Amanda Page [00:33:06]:
Not creating locked in. If you start watching, next thing you know, you're sending your friends memes for days.

Amanda Page [00:33:13]:
So, yeah, don't do that.

Liz Stapleton [00:33:14]:
Yeah.

Amanda Page [00:33:17]:
Look forward to getting those.

Liz Stapleton [00:33:20]:
But yeah, so no, I think it all comes back to telling a story. And if you're struggling with how to.

Amanda Page [00:33:25]:
Do it, look at Amanda stuff first, but also just see start looking at.

Liz Stapleton [00:32:57]:
Do it, look at Amanda stuff first, but also just see start looking at. The bloggers who you read and you enjoy going to and looking at taking a step back, not just from the story, but being like, hey, how are they weaving the story? And that this is why I like it. And kind of just take that step back and see what people you like are doing and why it is that you like that. And it will help, I think, to.

Amanda Page [00:33:51]:
Inform your own writing.

Liz Stapleton [00:33:50]:
Inform your own writing. 100%. Okay.

Liz Stapleton [00:33:56]:
Any final words or thoughts or tips.

Amanda Page [00:34:00]:
Actions they should take?

Amanda Page [00:34:04]:
No, I think we covered it because I really do, just to kind of recap, make those lists in the beginning.

Amanda Page [00:34:12]:
Just start playing on the page, pulling.

Amanda Page [00:34:16]:
Out things that you address.

Amanda Page [00:34:18]:
Guys, it doesn't be perfect.

Amanda Page [00:34:21]:
Yeah. And you know what some of your good stories are, right?

Amanda Page [00:34:24]:
Like, you already know. And I say talk to your people.

Amanda Page [00:34:29]:
But I also asked my friends once.

Amanda Page [00:34:32]:
There was an essay contest on the.

Amanda Page [00:34:36]:
Story of your life, and it was like, what's the one defining story of your life. So I asked three different friends of.

Liz Stapleton [00:34:40]:
Mine, hey, what do you think the.

Amanda Page [00:34:42]:
Defining story of my life is?

Amanda Page [00:34:43]:
And they came back with three different.

Amanda Page [00:34:45]:
Things to say this, but yeah, it's embarrassing to say that they each came back with a different public vomit story.

Amanda Page [00:34:50]:
And I was like, that's not how.

Amanda Page [00:34:54]:
I define my life. Those are the stories that they love to hear. So I don't know, maybe there's something in that. But also just in asking them, I never tell public vomit stories anymore, but I tell that story of the time that I asked three friends about what the story of my life is, and they came back with three different instances of me embarrassing myself in public.

Amanda Page [00:35:17]:
There's something to that.

Amanda Page [00:35:18]:
There's something under that story.

Amanda Page [00:35:19]:
Yeah, for sure.

Liz Stapleton [00:33:51]:
Yeah, for sure. When you talk to your people, we're not just saying talk to your audience, because your audience may not be speaking up yet, but talk to bloggers you.

Amanda Page [00:35:26]:
Up yet, but talk to bloggers you.

Liz Stapleton [00:35:28]:
Admire, communities, your friends, your family, they may not understand blogging, and they may look at you funny for doing a blog, because they don't understand it. But they understand stories, and they understand, I want to be able to tell a story.

Amanda Page [00:35:44]:
How do you think this sounds?

Liz Stapleton [00:35:26]:
How do you think this sounds? They can help in that regard because, yes, my family, I've been doing this Five years, and they still don't like what but they can understand a story.

Amanda Page [00:35:49]:
Five years, and they still don't like what but they can understand a story.

Liz Stapleton [00:35:56]:
And they give you feedback and ideas for stories, too.

Amanda Page [00:36:00]:
Yeah, 100%. That's the thing. You can ask your friends, hey, what do you think my best stories are? And you don't always have to agree, but you have to learn from what they've told you.

Liz Stapleton [00:36:11]:
Yeah. Don't be defensive about it.

Amanda Page [00:36:13]:
That's make life unhappy.

Amanda Page [00:36:16]:
Yeah, I do want to say, too, because this really helped me. A few years ago, I was talking to a friend of mine, and we were talking about being in a writer's group, and he said something about how it can be like an echo chamber. And he's the one I have a piece that you can link to below about.

Amanda Page [00:36:31]:
He was talking about going to open.

Amanda Page [00:36:33]:
Mics for a real audience. And although you may think that may.

Amanda Page [00:36:37]:
Not be the same as blogging, I.

Amanda Page [00:36:40]:
Know I have taken pieces that I drafted in my folder or drafted in WordPress to something and been like, I have this, and this is what I'm going to read. And pieces have become other things.

Amanda Page [00:36:53]:
So that can be really helpful, too.

Liz Stapleton [00:36:56]:
Yeah, and it is like, blogging is kind of like doing an open mic night. You're just doing it from behind a computer screen.

Liz Stapleton [00:37:04]:
Yeah, that's a great point. Yeah.

Liz Stapleton [00:37:08]:
And test it out. You could always actually go to a real open mic night if you're worried.

Amanda Page [00:37:12]:
About it's good to take things in front of other audiences. Like I said, sometimes you can just get into an echo chamber. It's good to talk to other bloggers.

Amanda Page [00:37:19]:
But also non bloggers.

Liz Stapleton [00:37:22]:
Yes.

Amanda Page [00:37:26]:
You don't stay too, in the world of people who are doing what you're.

Amanda Page [00:37:31]:
Doing because you've got to have outside.

Liz Stapleton [00:37:35]:
It becomes a back references and yeah.

Liz Stapleton [00:35:53]:
You've just yeah, you've got to keep.

Amanda Page [00:37:40]:
It interesting and layered.

Liz Stapleton [00:37:42]:
Yes. Awesome.

Liz Stapleton [00:37:43]:
Well, I think that is a lot of food for thought for people and gives them some ideas of how, especially.

Amanda Page [00:37:49]:
As new bloggers, to write.

Liz Stapleton [00:37:37]:
As new bloggers, to write. Don't stress about all the technical stuff. Just tell a story and you'll get.

Amanda Page [00:37:59]:
There with the rest.

Liz Stapleton [00:38:05]:
All right.

Amanda Page [00:38:05]:
Awesome.

**Transcript:**
[00:00:13.670] - Amanda
First things first, I just want to say thank you so much to Elizabeth for inviting me to be here with you all today. I'm so excited to be here and thank you for all of you that have shown up here with me live. Now while we're waiting, I just want to know what your biggest struggle with content creation is. We're going to wait just a second. I've got a few housekeeping items that we're going to go over as we wait for maybe a couple more people to come in here with us so they can be part of the live chat. But I want to know while we do that, what is your biggest struggle with content creation?

[00:00:41.880] 
Now, those housekeeping items? If you're watching this during the live presentation time, I am here in the chatbox with you. So please drop any and all questions you have into that chatbox. If you're not watching this, if you're watching this later in the day, please feel free to drop any and all questions you have inside the Facebook group and tag me so that I make sure to see them. 

[00:01:05.440] - Amanda
And finally, if you've grabbed the Pro Pass for yourself and you're watching this much later on and there's no more Facebook group, no more live chat. I'm still here to answer any questions that you have. Just hop over onto Instagram. Hop into my DMs. Let me know what questions you have. I am here for you.

[00:01:22.350] 
Also, if something really resonates with you during this presentation, please feel free to take a picture and share it on Instagram. Just make sure that you tag me. I'm @MsAmandaWarfield.

[00:01:34.830] 
Now, for those of you that have not met me yet, Hi, I'm Amanda. As a simplicity-focused content marketing strategist, I help creative entrepreneurs at marketing into their business without it taking over their business. I'm also the host of the Chasing Simple Podcast, a podcast to help creative entrepreneurs uncomplicate their life and biz.

[00:01:54.810] 
I've been passionate about education since I was a child. I even used to take all of my old school workbooks and set up a ""school"" on my parents back porch for all the neighbor kids during the summer. I don't think that they liked it quite as much as I did, but now I've traded in my classroom lesson plans for speaking and educating creative and sustainably growing their businesses. 

[00:02:14.950] - Amanda
If my nose isn't in the book, you can usually find me annoying my husband by slipping Disney into every conversation or annoying my cats by forcing them to snuggle me. 

[00:02:24.810] - Amanda
Now it's your turn. Throughout this presentation, I'm going to have question boxes just like this that I want you to answer over in the live chatbox. If you're here live or in the Facebook group, but make sure to tag me.

[00:02:36.760] - Amanda
All right. Are you ready? Let's practice. Here's an easy one. Head to either of those places now and answer this question. What is your favorite food? Mine personally is potatoes, all forms, mash, chips, fried. Love it all. That's my favorite, but I want to know what yours is. So let me know either in, again, the chatbox or the Facebook group. Tell me what your favorite food is.

[00:02:57.990] 
Now you are in the right place if you want to create space in your business to work on needle-moving tasks. These are the ones that generate revenue and move your business from stuck-in-the-mud to on-a-roll. You're in the right place, if you want content creation to become less of a struggle. You're ready to say goodbye to that burnout and that rung-out content creation feeling. And you want to see growth not just in your follower counts, your views, your click-through rates, but also in your revenue. Your bottom line.

[00:03:32.010] - Amanda
Here's our roadmap for the next half hour. 

[00:03:34.180] - Amanda
First, we'll talk about the biggest mistake being made with content marketing and how you can avoid it. Then you'll learn three things you can start implementing to help avoid that mistake. Next, I'll show you how to take it a step further with something special I've created for you. But enough of the housekeeping. I am all about using time well, and I'd hate to waste yours, so let's dive on in now.

[00:03:57.180] - Amanda
Maybe no one has told you this yet, but creating content is part of your business, but it's not your entire business. So why are we spending so much more time creating content than we are promoting it? And maybe that's where you are right now. Taking a step back and looking at where I was spending my work time made it clear that I was spending so much time creating content, that I wasn't spending any time growing my business. I realized I was spending all of my time working on my content instead of my content working...Instead of letting my content work for me.

[00:04:35.060] 
I had this giant Trello board filled with things I wanted and needed to do in my business in order to make progress. And it was collecting dust. My to-do list each week never seemed to get any shorter because of the amount of time I was spending on content, and the content I was putting out wasn't doing me any favors. I decided it was time to figure out how to truly get ahead of my content so that I could make moves and grow my business. 

[00:05:00.870] - Amanda
Now it's your turn. Be honest. Are you spending more time creating your blogs and your other content than you are promoting it? Let me know, which one are you spending more time on?

[00:05:15.450] 
Now, I bet that you're familiar with what I was going through, what I call the ""content creation hamster wheel."" You're mentally exhausted from being in create mode, and your business isn't moving forward because you don't have time to do anything but create content. 

[00:05:30.090] - Amanda
You're working a lot, but getting nowhere. And finding time to spend with loved ones without work hanging over your shoulder feels impossible. Worst of all, you don't have the capacity to come up with a true strategy that will move the needle and get you out of this place, because you're exhausted from constantly being in create mode.

[00:05:49.830] 
Here's the tea or the coffee as the case may be. It's not just you and I that struggle with this constant creation hamster wheel. You might have heard of podfade, but if not, it's when a podcast suddenly stops putting out new episodes without any notice, likely because they got stuck on that hamster wheel and they just couldn't find their way off. 

[00:06:09.210] - Amanda
Here are some interesting statistics for you. So as of June 2021, Apple Podcast was host to over 2 million podcasts. But only about 34% of those were active podcasts, meaning that they had released a new episode within the last 90 days. So 34%, that doesn't even mention how many have gone inactive in less than 90 days. And there are similar happenings in the blogging community, in the YouTube community as well, not to even take into account the non-active social media accounts that are out there. Why is this? 

[00:06:49.340] - Amanda
Well, it's because we've been told to do the impossible! Create content and make sure it's being pushed out according to the ideal schedule of that platform. Keep up with industry best practices and algorithm changes. Do all of the behind the scenes work of growing a business, because marketing is just one small part of it And somehow keep the needle moving forward! Because you're told to do all of these things without any real instruction on how to do so sustainably, we end up caught up on that content creation hamster wheel. Pumping out content left and right and then abandoning it when we become burnout or too busy with clients.

[00:07:26.430] - Amanda
We've been told if you show up and create content according to these best practices, your business will grow. That's not what's happening, is it? You're spending all this time creating content and your business isn't growing and you don't have time to do anything else.

[00:07:41.550] - Amanda
Have you ever found yourself doing any of these things? Staying up late to get your blog post out for the next day, spending hours creating a blog post the day it's supposed to go out creating content and working while on vacation, or just throwing up your hands entirely and deciding to just skip it this week, and maybe the next and the next. 

[00:08:02.890] - Amanda
If creating your blog post feels like just too much to handle some weeks, it doesn't have to be this way. You can absolutely create content, build an engaged audience, and thus your bottom line, without constantly creating new content and without that content burnout.

[00:08:22.410] 
The reason that you aren't seeing that growth currently is that you're missing one or both of the most important aspects of content: consistency and quality. Consistency has been shown to increase revenue by 25%. Are you showing up as often, as you said you would, are you showing up on time, or do you find yourself apologizing to your audience for being late? 

[00:08:44.770] - Amanda
And if you are always consistent, is what you're putting out there high quality? Or are you just throwing something together in an effort to get it out there? Poor quality content has been shown to decrease the probability of a sale by 40%. You must have both consistency and high-quality content to keep building your audience and growing your business, which sounds like an impossible feat, right? But the good news is you can create high-quality content consistently without being stuck on that content hamster wheel. 

[00:09:19.690] - Amanda
You can make time to work on your business. You can make time in your business to work on needle moving tasks. And you can let your content work for you for much longer than you actually spend working on it. And once you've got your content creation under control, you're going to have way more time to actually move the needle in your business and see major growth.

[00:09:43.210] 
Now, here's another question for you. How is your content affecting your business most? Are you undermining your relationship with your audience due to that lack of consistency and quality? Or are you unable to make any moves forward because you're constantly creating mode and you don't have time for anything else? Or maybe there's some other way that content is holding you back. I would love to hear about it. Remember, if you're here with me live, drop your answer in the chat, or if you're watching later post in the Facebook group, let me know, how is your content affecting your business the most? 

[00:10:17.050] - Amanda
Now you might be thinking, ""That's great for your student. I'm so glad that she was able to get off the hamster wheel and really start growing her business. That could never work for me."" Maybe you're thinking that you only have so many hours to work each week between your full-time job and everything else that's going on. When you can do this full time, that's when you're going to be able to grow. 

[00:10:36.670] - Amanda
But the hard truth is that you're never going to get a full time, if you can't grow your business. Being stuck on the content creation hamster will mean that it's going to be nearly impossible for you to grow to a place of being able to replace your income. You've got to get off of that wheel before you'll be able to get to that place. Not to mention that you're sticking yourself in really dangerous territory when it comes to that burnout and podfade that we talked about earlier. 

[00:11:03.310] - Amanda
You also might be thinking it's not possible to get ahead with the content creation schedule I've got. 

[00:11:07.850] - Amanda
I've got to show up for my blog, my podcast, my email list, plus TikTok, Instagram, Facebook, Twitter. The experts say that I need to post this many times a day and this many times a week. On all these different places. And if I'm not constantly creating new content, I'm going to lose the audience that I already have.

[00:11:24.310] 
Remember those two keys? The content to help with growth. High-quality, consistent content will do so much more for you than constant content. And you don't have to show up constantly in order to be consistent. I want you to take a moment and think about all the educators that you follow. The marketing gurus, if you will. Those wonderful educators are experts in what they do, but you don't see your favorite Instagram expert also telling you how to best show up and use LinkedIn, do you? 

[00:11:54.370] - Amanda
When you look at all the experts you follow, you may have the educators in your back pocket as a whole, telling you to be everywhere all the time, but individually, they're encouraging you to show up in one space, on one platform, not all of them. You do not need to show up on every platform, and you do not need to show up as much as you think you do. We get caught up thinking that we need to be everywhere all of the time. But that's just not true. 

[00:12:20.770] - Amanda
Soaking up so much content about all of those practices and all of these different places gives us the subconscious push to be all of the places. But less is more.

[00:12:31.270] - Amanda
Or you might even be thinking, ""It's just not realistic for me to create content in advance. I change my mind away too often and whenever I decide that I'm going to post four weeks from now, but when that time comes, I'm not going to want to post about it.""

[00:12:47.230] - Amanda
If you're running a business, you have got to plan long-term. If you want people to buy from you, you've got to be intentional about the content you're putting out. People don't buy without you intentionally taking the time to show them you're an expert in whatever it is that you're selling, without you carefully showing them whether or not they need what you're selling, and without you taking the time to walk them through any objections and questions that they may have. All of that takes intentional and long-term planning. 

[00:13:14.810] - Amanda
The bottom line is that your marketing, it's not about you. It's not for you. It's not about what you want to put out there. It's about what your audience needs you to put out so, it shouldn't be difficult to make a plan and stick to it.

[00:13:27.070] - Amanda
First. The first way that you're going to be able to simplify your content is to batch your content. 

[00:13:33.490] - Amanda
When was the last time you made a batch of cookies? I want you close your eyes, picture what I'm about to tell you in your mind. Okay? So, I'm going to share about the last time I made chocolate chip cookies. Are you ready?

[00:13:43.450] 
First, I pulled out my mixer, my cookie sheet, and all of the ingredients that I would need. Then I creamed together enough butter, sugar, eggs, and vanilla for one cookie. I stirred in enough flour and chocolate chips for one cookie, and then I dumped out one bottle of cookie dough, put it on my baking sheet, and baked it for ten minutes. Once it was done, I started mixing together everything for the second cookie. I baked that one for ten minutes, and then I started mixing all the ingredients for the third. All in all, it took me just 2 hours or so in baking time to make a batch of cookies, not to count all of the prep and clean up for each. 

[00:14:20.890] - Amanda
Okay, that's a total lie. I've never actually done that with cookies. But when it comes to creating content, that's exactly how most people are creating their content. Most people think that batching their content means they need to do all of the steps of creation for each piece of content before moving on to the next. Just like creating one cookie at a time.

[00:14:43.570] 
Goes a little something like this outline Blog Post One, write Blog Post One, edit Blog Post One, schedule Blog Post One. Realize you've got three more of these to do, and you've already exhausted and given up and go have a snack or take a nap. 

[00:14:58.630] - Amanda
What you should be doing is creating content by step instead of by the content piece. 

[00:15:04.270] - Amanda
Let's use a blog post as an example. So, just like you would measure out enough ingredients for twelve cookies at once. You also want to outline an entire month of the blog post at once. Then you would move into the mixing phase, A.K.A, drafting them all. Next, the baking or editing phase, and finally cooling or scheduling all of them. 

[00:15:26.890] - Amanda
If you set aside one week each month just to create content, that is the number one way to get off the content creation hamster wheel. Not only is it way more efficient, just like baking a dozen cookies could either take ten minutes total or 120 minutes total. But it gives you three weeks each month to not have to think about content, allowing you to leave that content creation hamster wheel and burn out behind.

[00:15:53.830] - Amanda
So your action step for this step is to open up your planner or calendar and mark off a week that you're going to set aside for a batch week. Then mark off all of your batch weeks for the remainder of 2022. 

[00:16:07.540] - Amanda
But if you're thinking that is still a lot of content, how can I fit it all into just one week? And the answer is quite literally simple. Well, simplifying. You're going to create better content, less often. Now, how many coffee drinkers do we have in here today? Let me know in the chat.

[00:16:25.280] - Amanda
When we lived in the Seattle area, I became a huge coffee drinker. The gloomy weather just made it impossible to get through the day without it, and it was honestly rare for me, to go anywhere without a cup of coffee in my hand. I was drinking it all day long, every single day. But the more I drank, the less impressive it became. Since I was constantly making pot, after pot, after pot, after pot of coffee, it became a chore to get done as quickly as I possibly could so that I could get more coffee in my hand. 

[00:16:59.250] - Amanda
But after moving back home to South Carolina, I reallized I didn't need as much coffee. Thank you, Sunshine. And because I didn't need as much, I had more time to play around with my coffee making. So instead of just making a straight pot of coffee over and over and over again, I have more interest in maybe foaming up my creamer or brewing a latte. And even though I'm drinking less, the cups I'm drinking do way more for me. 

[00:17:25.470] - Amanda
Yes, they give me that caffeine kick, but they also give me a little boost of joy because they're just plain better than a standard cup of coffee. And just like my coffee, high quality, consistent content beats quantity of content every time!

[00:17:41.570] 
Instead of trying to show up everywhere all the time. The first way to help stay consistent with your content is by showing up less. Decide where your audience is most active and where you have the most fun because marketing should be fun and go there. Then once you cut down where you're showing up, I want you to cut down how often you're trying to show up in those places. 

[00:18:02.190] - Amanda
So just like with my coffee, if you're spending less time creating content, you'll have more energy to get creative, with what you're putting out there. Now, remember, you don't have to hit standards for best practices in order to see growth in your business. That's often a trap we fall into, thinking that I've got to hit the best standards. I've got to show up this many times a week, this many times a day all these different places. Best practices are great, but they're not required.

[00:18:29.150] 
Now your action step for this tip is to make a list of all the places (Instagram, Facebook, YouTube, blog, etcetera) you're showing up and cutting it down. Then make a list of how much content you're trying to create and also cut that down. 

[00:18:45.170] - Amanda
The third step is to become an expert. I want you to take a moment and think about your best friend. When you thought of them, what was the first thing that came to mind for you? Was it a personality quirk, an interest of theirs? What was it? Let me know in the chat.

[00:19:02.570] 
When I think of my best friend? I think of California. Why? Because that's where she's from, and she talks about it constantly. On the flip side of that. When I think of California, I think of Megan. They've become linked in my mind. 

[00:19:15.210] - Amanda
But that didn't happen the first time I met her. It took months of us being friends and hanging out together and her talking about California. Lots and lots of repetition. If you want your audience to buy from you, you've got to become an expert in their mind. Often we feel like we need to constantly give our audience something new and fresh. But doing this is actually doing a disservice not only to you, but also to your audience. 

[00:19:42.230] - Amanda
Just like my best friend didn't become a link to my mind with California For many, many conversations. Your audience is not going to link you with what you do unless you repeat yourself over and over and over again. And how does this help with consistently showing up? Well, if you aren't having to scrape the barrel and constantly come up with new things to say, you can reuse what you've already created, saving a ton of time.

[00:20:08.720] - Amanda
You've spent a significant amount of time creating your long-form content, right? So make the most of your blogs by repurposing that content into your email and social media content. But not only that, you can literally reuse content that's already been created. The percentage of your audience sees any given post is so small and they're so inundated with content that they're not really going to remember any given post anyways. Plus, you get new followers constantly and they didn't see the last time you posted it. So spend less time creating content and become an expert in your audience's mind by being a broken record.

[00:20:46.910] - Amanda
Now your action step for this tip is to break up what you've already created into smaller, bite-sized pieces of content that can be used and scheduled to continuously promote your content over time, making it work for you for longer than it took you to create it.

[00:21:02.230] - Amanda
A few examples on how you can do this. So first, you can take the intro that you wrote for your blog post, and use that to get started writing the email that encourages your subscribers to go and read it. Another thing you can do is to take the main points of your blog post and create an Instagram post just going over those and encouraging your followers to head on over to the blog post to get more details about them.

[00:21:26.690] - Amanda
To recap those three steps to simplify your content in order to show up consistently were: 1. Batch your content; 2. Better content, less often; and 3. Become the expert. And your action steps for each of those were to mark off time for batch weeks on your calendar, simplify where you're showing up and how often you're showing up, and finally repurpose and reuse content that you've already created. 

[00:21:52.910] - Amanda
Now, here's another question for you. Which of these three do you plan to implement first? I would love to know which sounds the most enticing for your first step.

**Transcript:**
[00:00:12.840] - Amanda
Thank you so much for being with me here today at the Breakthrough Blogger Summit. I was thrilled to have been asked to speak again by Liz. So, Liz, thank you so much for having me again today. Now, if you've been abound for one of my past presentations at a different Breakthrough Blogger summit or event, I'm going to be speaking on something a little bit different today.

[00:00:29.230] - Amanda
So, I'm really, really excited that you're here, because today, we're going to be talking all about strategic content planning for 2023. So, today we are going to really make sure that you have a pathway forward to make sure that your content that you're putting out in 2023 is aligned with those business goals that you have for your blog. And I am so excited to dive in with that. But if we haven't met yet, I'm Amanda Warfield. I'm a simplicity focused content marketing strategist and the host of the Chasing Simple podcast.

[00:00:55.530] - Amanda
I am a crazy cat lady, and I also own another business that is a Disney specialized travel agency. So, this content marketing thing, I've been around the block for a while, and I'm doing it not only for myself, with both of my businesses, but with all of my clients as well. And this is the system that I use to help them and my businesses plan out their content marketing for the year. Now, a couple of health key things before we get started. First and foremost, if you are here with me live, I am in the chat box.

[00:01:22.180] - Amanda
Let's chat, let's connect. I'm going to have some questions for you throughout this, but I want to make sure that we're interacting and creating a dialogue because there's a lot to fit into a very small presentation. And I know you're going to have questions, so I'm here with you live. Any questions at all, leave them in that chat box. If you are watching this while the summit is still going on, but the live event isn't happening.

[00:01:41.280] - Amanda
So, it's after that first initial hour where this presentation has gone live. I am in the Facebook group, so please post any questions or comments you have in the Facebook group. Just make sure to tag me, so that it doesn't get lost. And third, if you've grabbed the all access pass and you're watching this way, in the future, please send me a DM, either on Instagram or on TikTok at Mrs. Amanda Warfield on both of those, or send me an email.

[00:02:02.010] - Amanda
I'm hello@amandawarfield.com. And then finally, if there's something that you really love about this presentation, something that really inspires you or that you want to make sure you share or save for later, please feel free to take a picture of it and share it on Instagram or wherever. Just make sure to tag me if you do. Again, I'm at Mrs. Amanda Warfield.

[00:02:20.890] - Amanda
And with that, let's go ahead and dive in. Like I said before, today, I'm going to walk you through exactly how I craft a strategic and intentional content marketing plan in order to help you put out content that's going to help you hit your business goals. But first, throughout this presentation, I'm going to have some question boxes like this. And this is just a great way for me to get to know you, but also to help us have a conversation around this topic. Because frankly, there's not enough time for me to do as much as a deep dive into this as I would like.

[00:02:53.530] - Amanda
And I know you're going to have questions and I don't want you to walk away feeling overwhelmed. So, when these come up, please make sure to answer them either in the chat box if you're here live, or head over to the Facebook Group and answer them there. Just be sure to tag me in those posts in the Facebook Group, so that I make sure I see it. Because a lot of times when there's a summit, there are so many posts happening in the Facebook Group that things can get lost. And I just want to make sure I see all of your different questions, comments, concerns, everything.

[00:03:21.490] - Amanda
So, make sure you tag me. But let's go ahead and practice. First question for you for this presentation is what is your favorite food? Like I said, pop it in the chat box or let me know over in the Facebook Group. Personally, my favorite food is potatoes.

[00:03:35.530] - Amanda
I love them in every single form, whether it's mashed or baked or french fries or chips or any form of potato. Love them so, so much. So, let me know what your favorite food is. And now that we've got the simple question, a fun question out of the way, we've broken the ice, I want to know when it comes to marketing, when you think of marketing, what is your first thought? What's the first thing you think when you think marketing?

[00:04:00.220] - Amanda
Let me know either in the live chat box or in the Facebook group. Now here's our roadmap for today. First and foremost, our overview. That's where we are now. We're kind of breaking the ice getting into this thing, trying to get us all on the same page. So that we can move forward and really get some great steps going, so that you can plan out your 2023 strategically.

[00:04:24.860] - Amanda
Next, we're going to move into goals. We're going to look at what your goals are for the year and we're going to do a little goal mapping. Third, we're going to set up your calendar, so that your business supports your life. Fourth, we're going to talk about monthly efforts, what they are, what they do, and how to plan for them. And then finally, we're going to look at how you can craft your strategic content plan for the year.

[00:04:51.260] - Amanda
But I want to make sure that we are all on the same page about how marketing fits into your life, because there's a ton of messaging out there about how different coaches or programs or systems are meant to help you create a business that supports your dream life, quote, unquote. But how many times have you intended to work on a big project or hold a launch or a major marketing campaign only to discover that there was something happening in your quote, unquote real life that was getting in the way. Whether it was a sick kid or a school vacation you forgot about or somebody's birthday. And you realize, oh man, there's a lot of party prep I need to do, it kind of takes over. And then you're stuck, honestly, feeling pulled into totally different directions and feeling like a bad business owner and a bad wife, mom, friend, insert whatever.

[00:05:42.640] - Amanda
You end up feeling stretched too thin in both directions. And this happens because we tend to create our business plans and our life plans separately. We tend to have one calendar for business and one calendar for our home life. And a lot of times, we don't integrate the two of them together. But when you walk away from this presentation today, you are going to have the tools to create a fully integrated work and life calendar for 2023, so that you can fit your marketing into your business, in your business, into your life.

[00:06:17.060] - Amanda
So, phase one, first thing we're going to do is we're going to check on your big goal for the year. So, right now, what is your big goal? For the sake of an example, we're going to use 50,000 blog views in 2023. Let's say this is your big goal for 2023. You want to have 50,000 blog views by the end of the year.

[00:06:36.940] - Amanda
So, then we're going to take that big goal, and we want to break it down by quarter. We want to say, this is how many views I'm aiming for in Q one. This is how many I'm aiming for in Q two. This is how many I'm aiming for in Q three, Q four, so on, and so forth. Let's say, this is the numbers you leaned on.

[00:06:53.640] - Amanda
In Q one, you're going to have 9 thousand, Q two, 16 thousand, Q three, 15 thousand, Q four, 10 thousand, leading to a total of 50,000. And when you look at this, you want to consider a couple of things. One, you want to consider last year's numbers. Where are the rises and the falls? Things are not going to be consistent numberwise all year long.

[00:07:15.640] - Amanda
So, maybe you have an off season. Maybe you are someone who finds that you know their niche gets really, really popular in Q two and Q three, but it's not as popular in Q four and Q one of each year. And so, you know that you're going to want to make sure that Q one and Q four are spent kind of preparing for that influx in Q three and Q two without neglecting your business obviously, but you're preparing, so that, okay. Q one, Q four, they're going to be kind of steady.

[00:07:50.610] - Amanda
But Q two and Q three, that's where I'm going to hopefully see a jump, and then I know what's going to receive. So, you're going to want to think about that. You're also going to want to think about what's happening in your life. If you know that in Q two, you are just going to be wiped, that there's going to be a lot of family stuff going on, that you're traveling a lot, whatever may be going on, if you know that that's going to be happening in Q two, maybe your number for Q two isn't that high, maybe it's a pretty low number.

[00:08:14.520] - Amanda
Maybe you're in maintenance mode for Q two instead of push mode. Those are a couple things I want you to think of as you break down your goal. You kind of analyze what you think it's going to look like when. So, look at last year. Look at where your rises and falls are, and then also look at your life.

[00:08:33.070] - Amanda
We're going to go deep into your calendar here soon, but, you know, just kind of start thinking about that. These numbers are not end all, be all. But I want to know what is your big goal for your blog in 2023? Let me know in the live chat. Let me know in the live chat.

[00:08:50.290] - Amanda
Let me know in the Facebook group whenever you're watching this. Let's talk about your big goal and how you can break that down. So, now we're going to move into goal mapping. And basically, what that looks like is you're going to take the next quarter. So Q one, okay, you decided Q one was going to be 9000 blog views, and we're going to get two things.

[00:09:11.970] - Amanda
One, what is your current monthly average? And two, what does that mean you need to bring in? So, if your current monthly average is 6000 views, you need to bring in 3000 more views throughout Q one. Well, how do we do that? That's always the next question.

[00:09:30.100] - Amanda
Okay, I know how much I need to bring in. How do I bring it in? And you're just going to brain dump. You're going to make a list of anything you can think of that can help you increase those blog views. Maybe it's something you've tried in the past and it's you've seen it work.

[00:09:44.100] - Amanda
Maybe it's something new you want to try in the new year. This is nothing concrete. This is just the simple brain dump mapping, projecting step. You're not worried about, this is a concrete action plan yet. This is just, here are some ideas that you have. So, some examples might be an improved Pinterest strategy.

[00:10:03.940] - Amanda
Maybe you're already on Pinterest, but you want to get even better with it, whether that's something you're going to take a course and learn it yourself or you're going to DIY it or you're going to hand it off to a Pinterest expert that can help bring in more people. Maybe that's guest blogging, maybe that's podcast interviews. What can you do to bring in those 3000 extra blog views for Q one? And because we're moving through this quickly, I don't have time to pause this and let you really think about it. So, just tell me, what is one action step that you can take to help reach your Q one goal?

[00:10:37.420] - Amanda
Let me know in the live chat. Let me know in the Facebook group. So, now that we kind of know what our goals are and we know where we're heading and what we're working towards, let's map out your calendar. So, step one is to highlight, mark off all of the personal side of things because we want to create a calendar that will ensure your business is going to support your life. And in order to do that, we have to start with the personal side of things.

[00:11:06.430] - Amanda
So, any holidays that are coming up, any birthdays, any anniversaries, vacations, time off, anything on the personal side of things that goes in first. So, some examples. The second, maybe your family isn't going to be back in school yet, maybe your spouse isn't going to be back at work. So, the second, you're not working, your kids are going to have an okay day off.

[00:11:29.760] - Amanda
So that's not going to be a work day. You have a family birthday at the end of the month, and you want to make sure you take that day off. We are protecting time for these important things. Winter break, got to mark that off. President's Day, school holiday, got to mark that off.

[00:11:45.880] - Amanda
Maybe you have spring break, maybe you have a vacation you're taking, whatever is happening in your personal life, that goes in first. And unless you have those in, you're going to move into your work overview. So, what are some work things that you know are happening throughout this next quarter or really throughout the whole year? Batch weeks. If you do a batch week, pop that in there.

[00:12:09.450] - Amanda
If you have coordinating, planning or goal setting, pop that in there. If there's a retreat or a conference you're going to, pop that in there. Any type of time where you're stepping back from the day-to-day in your business, CEO days, whatever that looks like, you're going to put those in now. And then once you have all of your time off and your time back, you're going to look at promotions, and that's how you're going to know how you can fit promotions into your life and business without it taking over your life and business. So, things like Black Friday or filling 2023 client spots or affiliate promotions, anything that's recurring, you can pop those in.

[00:12:47.940] - Amanda
If you know there's going to be a price increase, you can pop that in. If you know, okay, well, I want to have a flash sale at this time, pop that in. Any kind of promotion that you know is going to happen, look at the calendar, see if there's really enough space, and if there is, put it in there. Monthly efforts is what we're going to get to in just a second.

[00:13:07.890] - Amanda
But when it comes to putting promotions in, you want to make sure you're giving yourself the time and the space to do them. So, you wouldn't want to put a promotion in probably at the beginning of January. January is really, really crowded. You want to make sure you have enough time to get prepped for that promotion. So, looking at January, there's really only if you're working on Monday through Friday schedule, which I know a lot of us don't, but if you are, you got, you don't even have a full week.

[00:13:34.110] - Amanda
Every single week during January, there's at least one day where you're not working or taking a step back. So, you may not want to do any kind of anything until later in the month. February, not as crowded, could definitely be a time where you could put something in. You want to look at what your specific calendar looks like and what your personal and work overview looks like, so that you know what you have the time and space for.

[00:14:00.510] - Amanda
Now, monthly efforts, let's talk about those. We're going to pause phase three, go into phase four, and then come back to phase three.

[00:14:09.410] - Amanda
There are six different types of monthly efforts that I want you to consider. A monthly effort is a task, a project, a bonus, they are all kinds of different monthly efforts, but it's a way to move the needle in your business in some way, shape, or form. Now, the first one, community builder. It is a low pressure, low key way to build relationships with your audience outside of your content.

[00:14:38.140] - Amanda
A visibility booster is getting in front of new audiences or doing a large event. Typically, these come right before a launch. A list builder, it really varies. It can be as high key as a 30 day challenge, or it could be as simple as promoting something that you already have, a freebie, or a product, or whatever. A list builder probably wouldn't be a product, but something free that you have that you're just trying to get people on your list.

[00:15:05.550] - Amanda
List building. PR is pitching yourself to write articles, be a guest on a podcast, etc. Promotion is, you know, what are you promoting this month? What's your focus? Is it you know a larger launch that's coming up that you're focusing on? Is it a smaller flash sale?

[00:15:25.080] - Amanda
Is it, you don't really have anything major happening, but you just want to make sure that you're sharing about this one particular product in your shop, whatever that looks like, what are you promoting in order to make money, and then additional content. So, for example, if you have a membership, if you're going to be creating any additional content, you want to make sure to make a note of it so that you don't forget about it. So, typically, like I said, this is used when you have a membership or if you're just creating bonus content for some reason. Now, when it comes to monthly efforts, these are ways to help you get seen, marketing and content marketing in and of itself is great.

[00:15:59.170] - Amanda
But if content marketing is the only marketing you're doing and you're not building relationships and you're not doing any kind of monthly efforts, you're not going to grow. Content marketing is great for building relationships with people that have already found you. But if you want to get found, these are some monthly efforts you want to make sure that you're incorporating into your plan. Promotion isn't really going to help you get, I mean, it could just by nature if you're really going out for launch, but promotion is more. 

[00:16:25.120] - Amanda
So, you just want to make sure that you don't forget that you should be promoting something because of your business. But when it comes to monthly efforts, one, I want you to remember to start with one or two, start small. Do not feel pressured to do any of these just because they're an option. And two, as you start doing these, think about what can I automate and what can I pass off?

[00:16:47.230] - Amanda
And then let's say you decide, okay, first, I'm going to do a list builder and I'm going to create a new freebie and share about it. Well, next month you may be able to automate that. You may be able to just talk about it in your content and not have to worry about building it, building the actual freebie, building the actual system behind it because you're going to work on automating it as you create it.

[00:17:09.700] - Amanda
But those are all things to think about, how can I automate this? How can I pass it off, so that I can continue to list build without it really taking up a ton of my time and effort. Now this is something you're going to want to screenshot. This is how I kind of look at my monthly efforts and make sure I'm not planning too much. Just take a screenshot of this, so that you can have that kind of in mind.

[00:17:29.800] - Amanda
But I tend to, I always kind of have an idea of one thing I'm promoting each month, which is going to be strategic based on the content that's going out. And then maybe one other, maybe, if it's a really busy month, maybe nothing else. If you're doing any kind of collaborations, make sure you're putting them on here. But fill this out. You don't want to fill it out totally.

[00:17:51.480] - Amanda
You want it to be very sparse, but having it in front of you of this is where I'm going each month and this is what my focus is, will help you keep things cohesive and also help you keep them simple. So, I want you to take a second and think, are you actually already implementing any of these monthly efforts? Maybe you're already pushing yourself to be a guest blogger. Maybe you already have a freebie, maybe you already have a way to build community with your audience. Are you already implementing any of these?

[00:18:27.550] - Amanda
Let me know in the chat. But that's something to really think about, because if you're already implementing, just keep doing what you're doing. And again, look at what you're already implementing and say, can I automate it? Can I pass it off? And if yes, great.

[00:18:41.520] - Amanda
Then maybe you can add something new in next month or next quarter. Now, like I said, we're going to go back to phase three with the calendar, now that we know about monthly efforts, and we kind of have an idea of what that looks like. So, for the end of phase three, we are going to put those monthly efforts in. Let's say for January, you decide your monthly effort is going to be pitching for guest blogging opportunities. And you're just going to put a little sticking up on the top of January, because that's a goal that you're going to have. It's not a set date except other than the end of January, but your goal is that you're going to pitch to ten guest blogging opportunities throughout January.

[00:19:16.960] - Amanda
Let's say in February, you decide that you want to do some bonus content. You're going to do some live workshops, and you've got that, those are the dates for the end of February. And then you decide that you want to do a huge visibility booster because you're going to do a flash sale, end of March, you're going to do that March, and you're going to do a five-day challenge. By mapping all of this out, you're able to see just what you're putting on your plate.

[00:19:42.660] - Amanda
You're able to see how full your month is. So, for February, you know, that, okay, I have a couple weeks in February, after I get my prices increased, I know that I'm going to be working on these live workshops. And maybe you're already working on those in January too, as you're doing the guest blogging opportunities. And then, you know, okay, after I do this live workshops, the next thing is going to be this five-day challenge will bring some people in.

[00:20:04.150] - Amanda
And that five-day challenge is going to lead to the flash sale. So, what's the flash sale of? Okay, that's how you determine what your five-day challenge is going to be. So, now we have everything mapped out on your calendar, we're going to go into creating your content plan and your strategy.

[00:20:20.020] - Amanda
So your content is going to be based purely on this calendar and those monthly efforts that you have already determined.

[00:20:29.440] - Amanda
So, step one, when it comes to creating monthly content, you're going to double-check your dates. You're going to add anything new. Maybe you learned about a new vacation or your child care has changed or there's going to be time away. Maybe you thought of new things for your business and you're going to pop them in. I really don't recommend that on a monthly basis, but you know, sometimes it happens and it is what it is.

[00:20:50.770] - Amanda
So, any of that, add any of that to your calendar if you need to. And then we're going to create that monthly plan. There is a difference between a plan and a strategy. A plan is simply mapping out where you're posting and when. So, when it comes to creating your monthly plan, you're going to put any important dates in. So, for January, you would say, okay, the second I'm off the 16th, I'm off the 27th, I'm off the 30th and 31st, prices are increasing.

[00:21:19.990] - Amanda
You're going to put all of those things in your monthly plan, so that you can remember that they're there. Then you're going to do your longform content, in this case, your blog. What blogs are going where, and you don't know the top. You don't need to know the topic yet, but just when are you posting a new blog? Put those in. When are you going to send an email newsletter?

[00:21:39.570] - Amanda
Put that in. When are you going to put up social media and where? Put that in. Instagram, post, Facebook post, Tiktok, whatever social media platform you're on, when are you posting? Go ahead and map all of that out, so that you can see when you need to start talking about certain topics.

[00:21:56.730] - Amanda
This is going to be really important when it comes to the strategy side of things because if you know prices are increasing on the 30th and the 31st, and that's when your prices are moving around. If you know that, then in the week leading up, you know to talk about that. So, this is going to help you be really strategic with what you're talking about and when. But now we've got to create the strategy. And strategy is using that plan and using all of the other things that we've created to decide what you're talking about and how.

[00:22:26.320] - Amanda
And you're going to finalize your long-form content with the big three. First, your call to action, then your topic, and then your hook. And you're going to decide these in that order. So, your call to action is going to be what leads your people to the next step. And the next step is going to want to be aligned with your current business goals.

[00:22:48.000] - Amanda
So, if you're trying to get your blog view as 50,000 blog views, your CTA is going to be how you can get more blog views. So, whether that is you're going to go the route of getting them on your email list and then sending them emails with new blog posts to look at, or if that's simply this is another great blog post, be sure to check it out if you like this one. You want to align that call to action with your strategy. Now when you come to launches or you've got other promotions going on, your call to action might be aligned with those goals. But for the overall goal, those would be two different ways you can do that call to action if your goal is to get more views on your blog.

[00:23:30.040] - Amanda
Then you're going to look at your topic. If you know what your call to action is, you know where they're leading them. Okay, well, what topic can you talk about within your niche? What small bitesized idea can your content surround that's going to lead to that call to action? And then once you know your topic and your call to action, you're going to determine your hook, which is the very first thing that you say in order to draw in your people.

[00:23:53.880] - Amanda
We want to say goodbye to the, hi, I'm so and so, let's chat about X type of intro. We don't want to do that. We want to pull people in, so that they can't stop reading. And once you've finalized your long-form content, then you're going to finalize your email newsletters, and you're going to base your email newsletters off of your long-form content. But maybe you've got a call to action with a different CTA.

[00:24:16.860] - Amanda
Call to action with different CTA. You've got a different CTA within your email newsletter because a reminder of a promo. Make sure you're looking at the calendar as you're creating your CTA, your topic in your hook for your newsletters, but save yourself some time and energy and base it off of your long-form content. Same thing with your social media. Base it off of your long-form content.

[00:24:35.970] - Amanda
But remember to check for those reminders and promos. Okay. That was a lot in not a lot of time. So, let's recap this really quickly. When it comes to creating a strategic content plan, first, you're going to do a goal check in. You're going to look at your goals and you're going to break them down.

[00:24:53.820] - Amanda
Then you're going to do goal mapping and you're going to say, this is where I'm at. This is where I need to be. These are some ways I might get there. Then you're going to look at your calendar and you're going to map out your calendar. You're going to start with your personal life.

[00:25:06.430] - Amanda
Then you're going to add in your work life, and then you're going to add in promotions and monthly efforts. Phase four is really determining what those monthly efforts are going to be and finalizing them. How can you grow, how can you partner with your content marketing in order to grow your efforts? Those monthly efforts are going to partner with your content marketing in order to grow your business, grow your reach. And then finally, you're going to take everything that you mapped out and you're going to create your content plan, and then you're going to use that plan to create your strategy.

[00:25:47.140] - Amanda
And as a reminder, we do it this way in this order because we want to fit your marketing into your business without it taking over your business. We don't want your marketing to take over your business, and we don't want your business to take over your life.

[00:26:03.110] - Amanda

**Transcript:**
[00:00:12.840] - Amanda
Thank you so much for being with me here today at the Breakthrough Blogger Summit. I was thrilled to have been asked to speak again by Liz. So, Liz, thank you so much for having me again today. Now, if you've been abound for one of my past presentations at a different Breakthrough Blogger summit or event, I'm going to be speaking on something a little bit different today.

[00:00:29.230] - Amanda
So, I'm really, really excited that you're here, because today, we're going to be talking all about strategic content planning for 2023. So, today we are going to really make sure that you have a pathway forward to make sure that your content that you're putting out in 2023 is aligned with those business goals that you have for your blog. And I am so excited to dive in with that. But if we haven't met yet, I'm Amanda Warfield. I'm a simplicity focused content marketing strategist and the host of the Chasing Simple podcast.

[00:00:55.530] - Amanda
I am a crazy cat lady, and I also own another business that is a Disney specialized travel agency. So, this content marketing thing, I've been around the block for a while, and I'm doing it not only for myself, with both of my businesses, but with all of my clients as well. And this is the system that I use to help them and my businesses plan out their content marketing for the year. Now, a couple of health key things before we get started. First and foremost, if you are here with me live, I am in the chat box.

[00:01:22.180] - Amanda
Let's chat, let's connect. I'm going to have some questions for you throughout this, but I want to make sure that we're interacting and creating a dialogue because there's a lot to fit into a very small presentation. And I know you're going to have questions, so I'm here with you live. Any questions at all, leave them in that chat box. If you are watching this while the summit is still going on, but the live event isn't happening.

[00:01:41.280] - Amanda
So, it's after that first initial hour where this presentation has gone live. I am in the Facebook group, so please post any questions or comments you have in the Facebook group. Just make sure to tag me, so that it doesn't get lost. And third, if you've grabbed the all access pass and you're watching this way, in the future, please send me a DM, either on Instagram or on TikTok at Mrs. Amanda Warfield on both of those, or send me an email.

[00:02:02.010] - Amanda
I'm hello@amandawarfield.com. And then finally, if there's something that you really love about this presentation, something that really inspires you or that you want to make sure you share or save for later, please feel free to take a picture of it and share it on Instagram or wherever. Just make sure to tag me if you do. Again, I'm at Mrs. Amanda Warfield.

[00:02:20.890] - Amanda
And with that, let's go ahead and dive in. Like I said before, today, I'm going to walk you through exactly how I craft a strategic and intentional content marketing plan in order to help you put out content that's going to help you hit your business goals. But first, throughout this presentation, I'm going to have some question boxes like this. And this is just a great way for me to get to know you, but also to help us have a conversation around this topic. Because frankly, there's not enough time for me to do as much as a deep dive into this as I would like.

[00:02:53.530] - Amanda
And I know you're going to have questions and I don't want you to walk away feeling overwhelmed. So, when these come up, please make sure to answer them either in the chat box if you're here live, or head over to the Facebook Group and answer them there. Just be sure to tag me in those posts in the Facebook Group, so that I make sure I see it. Because a lot of times when there's a summit, there are so many posts happening in the Facebook Group that things can get lost. And I just want to make sure I see all of your different questions, comments, concerns, everything.

[00:03:21.490] - Amanda
So, make sure you tag me. But let's go ahead and practice. First question for you for this presentation is what is your favorite food? Like I said, pop it in the chat box or let me know over in the Facebook Group. Personally, my favorite food is potatoes.

[00:03:35.530] - Amanda
I love them in every single form, whether it's mashed or baked or french fries or chips or any form of potato. Love them so, so much. So, let me know what your favorite food is. And now that we've got the simple question, a fun question out of the way, we've broken the ice, I want to know when it comes to marketing, when you think of marketing, what is your first thought? What's the first thing you think when you think marketing?

[00:04:00.220] - Amanda
Let me know either in the live chat box or in the Facebook group. Now here's our roadmap for today. First and foremost, our overview. That's where we are now. We're kind of breaking the ice getting into this thing, trying to get us all on the same page. So that we can move forward and really get some great steps going, so that you can plan out your 2023 strategically.

[00:04:24.860] - Amanda
Next, we're going to move into goals. We're going to look at what your goals are for the year and we're going to do a little goal mapping. Third, we're going to set up your calendar, so that your business supports your life. Fourth, we're going to talk about monthly efforts, what they are, what they do, and how to plan for them. And then finally, we're going to look at how you can craft your strategic content plan for the year.

[00:04:51.260] - Amanda
But I want to make sure that we are all on the same page about how marketing fits into your life, because there's a ton of messaging out there about how different coaches or programs or systems are meant to help you create a business that supports your dream life, quote, unquote. But how many times have you intended to work on a big project or hold a launch or a major marketing campaign only to discover that there was something happening in your quote, unquote real life that was getting in the way. Whether it was a sick kid or a school vacation you forgot about or somebody's birthday. And you realize, oh man, there's a lot of party prep I need to do, it kind of takes over. And then you're stuck, honestly, feeling pulled into totally different directions and feeling like a bad business owner and a bad wife, mom, friend, insert whatever.

[00:05:42.640] - Amanda
You end up feeling stretched too thin in both directions. And this happens because we tend to create our business plans and our life plans separately. We tend to have one calendar for business and one calendar for our home life. And a lot of times, we don't integrate the two of them together. But when you walk away from this presentation today, you are going to have the tools to create a fully integrated work and life calendar for 2023, so that you can fit your marketing into your business, in your business, into your life.

[00:06:17.060] - Amanda
So, phase one, first thing we're going to do is we're going to check on your big goal for the year. So, right now, what is your big goal? For the sake of an example, we're going to use 50,000 blog views in 2023. Let's say this is your big goal for 2023. You want to have 50,000 blog views by the end of the year.

[00:06:36.940] - Amanda
So, then we're going to take that big goal, and we want to break it down by quarter. We want to say, this is how many views I'm aiming for in Q one. This is how many I'm aiming for in Q two. This is how many I'm aiming for in Q three, Q four, so on, and so forth. Let's say, this is the numbers you leaned on.

[00:06:53.640] - Amanda
In Q one, you're going to have 9 thousand, Q two, 16 thousand, Q three, 15 thousand, Q four, 10 thousand, leading to a total of 50,000. And when you look at this, you want to consider a couple of things. One, you want to consider last year's numbers. Where are the rises and the falls? Things are not going to be consistent numberwise all year long.

[00:07:15.640] - Amanda
So, maybe you have an off season. Maybe you are someone who finds that you know their niche gets really, really popular in Q two and Q three, but it's not as popular in Q four and Q one of each year. And so, you know that you're going to want to make sure that Q one and Q four are spent kind of preparing for that influx in Q three and Q two without neglecting your business obviously, but you're preparing, so that, okay. Q one, Q four, they're going to be kind of steady.

[00:07:50.610] - Amanda
But Q two and Q three, that's where I'm going to hopefully see a jump, and then I know what's going to receive. So, you're going to want to think about that. You're also going to want to think about what's happening in your life. If you know that in Q two, you are just going to be wiped, that there's going to be a lot of family stuff going on, that you're traveling a lot, whatever may be going on, if you know that that's going to be happening in Q two, maybe your number for Q two isn't that high, maybe it's a pretty low number.

[00:08:14.520] - Amanda
Maybe you're in maintenance mode for Q two instead of push mode. Those are a couple things I want you to think of as you break down your goal. You kind of analyze what you think it's going to look like when. So, look at last year. Look at where your rises and falls are, and then also look at your life.

[00:08:33.070] - Amanda
We're going to go deep into your calendar here soon, but, you know, just kind of start thinking about that. These numbers are not end all, be all. But I want to know what is your big goal for your blog in 2023? Let me know in the live chat. Let me know in the live chat.

[00:08:50.290] - Amanda
Let me know in the Facebook group whenever you're watching this. Let's talk about your big goal and how you can break that down. So, now we're going to move into goal mapping. And basically, what that looks like is you're going to take the next quarter. So Q one, okay, you decided Q one was going to be 9000 blog views, and we're going to get two things.

[00:09:11.970] - Amanda
One, what is your current monthly average? And two, what does that mean you need to bring in? So, if your current monthly average is 6000 views, you need to bring in 3000 more views throughout Q one. Well, how do we do that? That's always the next question.

[00:09:30.100] - Amanda
Okay, I know how much I need to bring in. How do I bring it in? And you're just going to brain dump. You're going to make a list of anything you can think of that can help you increase those blog views. Maybe it's something you've tried in the past and it's you've seen it work.

[00:09:44.100] - Amanda
Maybe it's something new you want to try in the new year. This is nothing concrete. This is just the simple brain dump mapping, projecting step. You're not worried about, this is a concrete action plan yet. This is just, here are some ideas that you have. So, some examples might be an improved Pinterest strategy.

[00:10:03.940] - Amanda
Maybe you're already on Pinterest, but you want to get even better with it, whether that's something you're going to take a course and learn it yourself or you're going to DIY it or you're going to hand it off to a Pinterest expert that can help bring in more people. Maybe that's guest blogging, maybe that's podcast interviews. What can you do to bring in those 3000 extra blog views for Q one? And because we're moving through this quickly, I don't have time to pause this and let you really think about it. So, just tell me, what is one action step that you can take to help reach your Q one goal?

[00:10:37.420] - Amanda
Let me know in the live chat. Let me know in the Facebook group. So, now that we kind of know what our goals are and we know where we're heading and what we're working towards, let's map out your calendar. So, step one is to highlight, mark off all of the personal side of things because we want to create a calendar that will ensure your business is going to support your life. And in order to do that, we have to start with the personal side of things.

[00:11:06.430] - Amanda
So, any holidays that are coming up, any birthdays, any anniversaries, vacations, time off, anything on the personal side of things that goes in first. So, some examples. The second, maybe your family isn't going to be back in school yet, maybe your spouse isn't going to be back at work. So, the second, you're not working, your kids are going to have an okay day off.

[00:11:29.760] - Amanda
So that's not going to be a work day. You have a family birthday at the end of the month, and you want to make sure you take that day off. We are protecting time for these important things. Winter break, got to mark that off. President's Day, school holiday, got to mark that off.

[00:11:45.880] - Amanda
Maybe you have spring break, maybe you have a vacation you're taking, whatever is happening in your personal life, that goes in first. And unless you have those in, you're going to move into your work overview. So, what are some work things that you know are happening throughout this next quarter or really throughout the whole year? Batch weeks. If you do a batch week, pop that in there.

[00:12:09.450] - Amanda
If you have coordinating, planning or goal setting, pop that in there. If there's a retreat or a conference you're going to, pop that in there. Any type of time where you're stepping back from the day-to-day in your business, CEO days, whatever that looks like, you're going to put those in now. And then once you have all of your time off and your time back, you're going to look at promotions, and that's how you're going to know how you can fit promotions into your life and business without it taking over your life and business. So, things like Black Friday or filling 2023 client spots or affiliate promotions, anything that's recurring, you can pop those in.

[00:12:47.940] - Amanda
If you know there's going to be a price increase, you can pop that in. If you know, okay, well, I want to have a flash sale at this time, pop that in. Any kind of promotion that you know is going to happen, look at the calendar, see if there's really enough space, and if there is, put it in there. Monthly efforts is what we're going to get to in just a second.

[00:13:07.890] - Amanda
But when it comes to putting promotions in, you want to make sure you're giving yourself the time and the space to do them. So, you wouldn't want to put a promotion in probably at the beginning of January. January is really, really crowded. You want to make sure you have enough time to get prepped for that promotion. So, looking at January, there's really only if you're working on Monday through Friday schedule, which I know a lot of us don't, but if you are, you got, you don't even have a full week.

[00:13:34.110] - Amanda
Every single week during January, there's at least one day where you're not working or taking a step back. So, you may not want to do any kind of anything until later in the month. February, not as crowded, could definitely be a time where you could put something in. You want to look at what your specific calendar looks like and what your personal and work overview looks like, so that you know what you have the time and space for.

[00:14:00.510] - Amanda
Now, monthly efforts, let's talk about those. We're going to pause phase three, go into phase four, and then come back to phase three.

[00:14:09.410] - Amanda
There are six different types of monthly efforts that I want you to consider. A monthly effort is a task, a project, a bonus, they are all kinds of different monthly efforts, but it's a way to move the needle in your business in some way, shape, or form. Now, the first one, community builder. It is a low pressure, low key way to build relationships with your audience outside of your content.

[00:14:38.140] - Amanda
A visibility booster is getting in front of new audiences or doing a large event. Typically, these come right before a launch. A list builder, it really varies. It can be as high key as a 30 day challenge, or it could be as simple as promoting something that you already have, a freebie, or a product, or whatever. A list builder probably wouldn't be a product, but something free that you have that you're just trying to get people on your list.

[00:15:05.550] - Amanda
List building. PR is pitching yourself to write articles, be a guest on a podcast, etc. Promotion is, you know, what are you promoting this month? What's your focus? Is it you know a larger launch that's coming up that you're focusing on? Is it a smaller flash sale?

[00:15:25.080] - Amanda
Is it, you don't really have anything major happening, but you just want to make sure that you're sharing about this one particular product in your shop, whatever that looks like, what are you promoting in order to make money, and then additional content. So, for example, if you have a membership, if you're going to be creating any additional content, you want to make sure to make a note of it so that you don't forget about it. So, typically, like I said, this is used when you have a membership or if you're just creating bonus content for some reason. Now, when it comes to monthly efforts, these are ways to help you get seen, marketing and content marketing in and of itself is great.

[00:15:59.170] - Amanda
But if content marketing is the only marketing you're doing and you're not building relationships and you're not doing any kind of monthly efforts, you're not going to grow. Content marketing is great for building relationships with people that have already found you. But if you want to get found, these are some monthly efforts you want to make sure that you're incorporating into your plan. Promotion isn't really going to help you get, I mean, it could just by nature if you're really going out for launch, but promotion is more. 

[00:16:25.120] - Amanda
So, you just want to make sure that you don't forget that you should be promoting something because of your business. But when it comes to monthly efforts, one, I want you to remember to start with one or two, start small. Do not feel pressured to do any of these just because they're an option. And two, as you start doing these, think about what can I automate and what can I pass off?

[00:16:47.230] - Amanda
And then let's say you decide, okay, first, I'm going to do a list builder and I'm going to create a new freebie and share about it. Well, next month you may be able to automate that. You may be able to just talk about it in your content and not have to worry about building it, building the actual freebie, building the actual system behind it because you're going to work on automating it as you create it.

[00:17:09.700] - Amanda
But those are all things to think about, how can I automate this? How can I pass it off, so that I can continue to list build without it really taking up a ton of my time and effort. Now this is something you're going to want to screenshot. This is how I kind of look at my monthly efforts and make sure I'm not planning too much. Just take a screenshot of this, so that you can have that kind of in mind.

[00:17:29.800] - Amanda
But I tend to, I always kind of have an idea of one thing I'm promoting each month, which is going to be strategic based on the content that's going out. And then maybe one other, maybe, if it's a really busy month, maybe nothing else. If you're doing any kind of collaborations, make sure you're putting them on here. But fill this out. You don't want to fill it out totally.

[00:17:51.480] - Amanda
You want it to be very sparse, but having it in front of you of this is where I'm going each month and this is what my focus is, will help you keep things cohesive and also help you keep them simple. So, I want you to take a second and think, are you actually already implementing any of these monthly efforts? Maybe you're already pushing yourself to be a guest blogger. Maybe you already have a freebie, maybe you already have a way to build community with your audience. Are you already implementing any of these?

[00:18:27.550] - Amanda
Let me know in the chat. But that's something to really think about, because if you're already implementing, just keep doing what you're doing. And again, look at what you're already implementing and say, can I automate it? Can I pass it off? And if yes, great.

[00:18:41.520] - Amanda
Then maybe you can add something new in next month or next quarter. Now, like I said, we're going to go back to phase three with the calendar, now that we know about monthly efforts, and we kind of have an idea of what that looks like. So, for the end of phase three, we are going to put those monthly efforts in. Let's say for January, you decide your monthly effort is going to be pitching for guest blogging opportunities. And you're just going to put a little sticking up on the top of January, because that's a goal that you're going to have. It's not a set date except other than the end of January, but your goal is that you're going to pitch to ten guest blogging opportunities throughout January.

[00:19:16.960] - Amanda
Let's say in February, you decide that you want to do some bonus content. You're going to do some live workshops, and you've got that, those are the dates for the end of February. And then you decide that you want to do a huge visibility booster because you're going to do a flash sale, end of March, you're going to do that March, and you're going to do a five-day challenge. By mapping all of this out, you're able to see just what you're putting on your plate.

[00:19:42.660] - Amanda
You're able to see how full your month is. So, for February, you know, that, okay, I have a couple weeks in February, after I get my prices increased, I know that I'm going to be working on these live workshops. And maybe you're already working on those in January too, as you're doing the guest blogging opportunities. And then, you know, okay, after I do this live workshops, the next thing is going to be this five-day challenge will bring some people in.

[00:20:04.150] - Amanda
And that five-day challenge is going to lead to the flash sale. So, what's the flash sale of? Okay, that's how you determine what your five-day challenge is going to be. So, now we have everything mapped out on your calendar, we're going to go into creating your content plan and your strategy.

[00:20:20.020] - Amanda
So your content is going to be based purely on this calendar and those monthly efforts that you have already determined.

[00:20:29.440] - Amanda
So, step one, when it comes to creating monthly content, you're going to double-check your dates. You're going to add anything new. Maybe you learned about a new vacation or your child care has changed or there's going to be time away. Maybe you thought of new things for your business and you're going to pop them in. I really don't recommend that on a monthly basis, but you know, sometimes it happens and it is what it is.

[00:20:50.770] - Amanda
So, any of that, add any of that to your calendar if you need to. And then we're going to create that monthly plan. There is a difference between a plan and a strategy. A plan is simply mapping out where you're posting and when. So, when it comes to creating your monthly plan, you're going to put any important dates in. So, for January, you would say, okay, the second I'm off the 16th, I'm off the 27th, I'm off the 30th and 31st, prices are increasing.

[00:21:19.990] - Amanda
You're going to put all of those things in your monthly plan, so that you can remember that they're there. Then you're going to do your longform content, in this case, your blog. What blogs are going where, and you don't know the top. You don't need to know the topic yet, but just when are you posting a new blog? Put those in. When are you going to send an email newsletter?

[00:21:39.570] - Amanda
Put that in. When are you going to put up social media and where? Put that in. Instagram, post, Facebook post, Tiktok, whatever social media platform you're on, when are you posting? Go ahead and map all of that out, so that you can see when you need to start talking about certain topics.

[00:21:56.730] - Amanda
This is going to be really important when it comes to the strategy side of things because if you know prices are increasing on the 30th and the 31st, and that's when your prices are moving around. If you know that, then in the week leading up, you know to talk about that. So, this is going to help you be really strategic with what you're talking about and when. But now we've got to create the strategy. And strategy is using that plan and using all of the other things that we've created to decide what you're talking about and how.

[00:22:26.320] - Amanda
And you're going to finalize your long-form content with the big three. First, your call to action, then your topic, and then your hook. And you're going to decide these in that order. So, your call to action is going to be what leads your people to the next step. And the next step is going to want to be aligned with your current business goals.

[00:22:48.000] - Amanda
So, if you're trying to get your blog view as 50,000 blog views, your CTA is going to be how you can get more blog views. So, whether that is you're going to go the route of getting them on your email list and then sending them emails with new blog posts to look at, or if that's simply this is another great blog post, be sure to check it out if you like this one. You want to align that call to action with your strategy. Now when you come to launches or you've got other promotions going on, your call to action might be aligned with those goals. But for the overall goal, those would be two different ways you can do that call to action if your goal is to get more views on your blog.

[00:23:30.040] - Amanda
Then you're going to look at your topic. If you know what your call to action is, you know where they're leading them. Okay, well, what topic can you talk about within your niche? What small bitesized idea can your content surround that's going to lead to that call to action? And then once you know your topic and your call to action, you're going to determine your hook, which is the very first thing that you say in order to draw in your people.

[00:23:53.880] - Amanda
We want to say goodbye to the, hi, I'm so and so, let's chat about X type of intro. We don't want to do that. We want to pull people in, so that they can't stop reading. And once you've finalized your long-form content, then you're going to finalize your email newsletters, and you're going to base your email newsletters off of your long-form content. But maybe you've got a call to action with a different CTA.

[00:24:16.860] - Amanda
Call to action with different CTA. You've got a different CTA within your email newsletter because a reminder of a promo. Make sure you're looking at the calendar as you're creating your CTA, your topic in your hook for your newsletters, but save yourself some time and energy and base it off of your long-form content. Same thing with your social media. Base it off of your long-form content.

[00:24:35.970] - Amanda
But remember to check for those reminders and promos. Okay. That was a lot in not a lot of time. So, let's recap this really quickly. When it comes to creating a strategic content plan, first, you're going to do a goal check in. You're going to look at your goals and you're going to break them down.

[00:24:53.820] - Amanda
Then you're going to do goal mapping and you're going to say, this is where I'm at. This is where I need to be. These are some ways I might get there. Then you're going to look at your calendar and you're going to map out your calendar. You're going to start with your personal life.

[00:25:06.430] - Amanda
Then you're going to add in your work life, and then you're going to add in promotions and monthly efforts. Phase four is really determining what those monthly efforts are going to be and finalizing them. How can you grow, how can you partner with your content marketing in order to grow your efforts? Those monthly efforts are going to partner with your content marketing in order to grow your business, grow your reach. And then finally, you're going to take everything that you mapped out and you're going to create your content plan, and then you're going to use that plan to create your strategy.

[00:25:47.140] - Amanda
And as a reminder, we do it this way in this order because we want to fit your marketing into your business without it taking over your business. We don't want your marketing to take over your business, and we don't want your business to take over your life.

[00:26:03.110] - Amanda

What was your biggest takeaway from this presentation and did you have any ah-ha moments?

**Transcript:**
Andréa Jones [00:00:12]:
Hello, and welcome to the Reduce, Reuse, and Recycle Social Media Content Repurposing workshop. I'm super excited about this because we're gonna cover a lot today in our time together. I'm gonna share with you my 3 favorite types of content repurposing strategies. We're gonna try to work smarter, not harder in this session today. I wanna help you, decide what kind of content to repurpose. So when we think about all of the types of things we post to social media, I wanna help you figure out where you can repurpose those content pieces. And then I also wanna talk about how to layer repurposing into your overall social media content plan as well as some of the rules for repurposing content on social media, because you can't just keep posting the same thing over and over again without getting penalized. So I wanna talk about what that looks like.

Andréa Jones [00:01:03]:
Now a little bit of an introduction for those of you who don't know me. Hello. My name is Andrea Jones. I'm a social media strategist. I've taught thousands of students in my programs. I was named one of the top digital marketers to follow in 2019 and 2020, and I'm the host of a top 100 podcast, the Savvy Social podcast. There are a few things I strongly and firmly believe about social media. Social media is meant to be social.

Andréa Jones [00:01:29]:
So the purpose of this session is to help you automate or repurpose some of your hard work so you can spend more time networking and growing your social media audience. Social media boundaries are also very important for business owners with all of the things that happen on social media. It's so easy to get sucked in and waste so much time there. And so I wanna help you kind of set some parameters around what you do. And I'm a firm believer that you do not need to hustle or be quote, unquote on all the time to be successful. One of the things that I teach in my programs is turn off your notifications. Focus on finding the right people and ignoring everyone else. Okay? Because honestly, some of us are in a social media situationship.

Andréa Jones [00:02:19]:
A social media situationship meaning a little bit of a toxic relationship. We love it because we understand the value that it brings to our business. We can we can see that, you know, the potential for bringing in new clients and customers, but also, we don't know where we stand with social media, feels a little bit like that toxic partner who's gaslighting you. You feel like you're constantly seeking validation, and it feels a little bit unhealthy sometimes. Right? And so I wanna help us break down the social media situationship, and help us move forward with confidence specifically when it comes to repurposing content because there's a few common roadblocks when I see business owners approach social media. They're overwhelmed with all of the options. There's all of these platforms with new ones popping up every day. They're feeling a sense of dread because of that social media notification.

Andréa Jones [00:03:17]:
We feel like we're not inspired to post. And then when we do feel inspired, we're not sure exactly what to say or what to do. And we feel like we're on this content machine. We are constantly having to produce content, and I'm really focusing in on this last one today, this content machine by helping you use a content repurposing strategy. Now content repurposing, as defined by CoSchedule, is repurposing content simply means taking one asset and reusing it elsewhere. They go on to say that although this sounds very simple in theory, it gets a little tricky with the execution. So to really make it work, you have to start with that content repurposing strategy in mind. So when you sit down to create your content, you wanna start thinking about all the different ways you can slice it and dice it and reuse it.

Andréa Jones [00:04:13]:
And the benefits of repurposing content, honestly, are amazing because you really get to focus in your energy on producing something really amazing, a great asset, and then you can reuse it, you can repost it, you can cut it up, slice it up, use it in different ways. And because you put your energy in creating a better piece of work, a higher quality piece of work, You're not having to split your attention across all of the different platforms, across all of the different mediums, thinking about all of the different things that you have to create. So we're gonna work hard once as my coach Rachel Rogers says. Alright. So we're gonna use an evergreen content strategy as the first method of repurposing our content, an evergreen content strategy. Now the definition of evergreen content is the social media content that can be posted any day of the week at any time. Okay? Social media content that can be posted on any day of the week at any time. So essentially, these are things like promoting your brand, your service, promoting a blog or a podcast that isn't timely.

Andréa Jones [00:05:22]:
These can be educational type posts, where you're sharing a tip of the day, you're sharing your expertise. This can be a question of the day type post, the type of post where you're pulling your community into an engaging conversation. This can be a quote post, so something inspiring, something motivating. This could be a post with your lead magnet or something for your sales funnel, where you're asking them to do something to take that next step towards working with you and your business. What evergreen content is not is it's not a limited time offer or a sale. Something like a flash sale, maybe a holiday sale would not be evergreen content. Seasonal content like a Halloween or a Valentine's Day type of content. Trending topics, so things that may be trending, currently, things like COVID or the Olympics, or a specific event that's happening, or even a certain trend that's happening at the time like a fidget spinner.

Andréa Jones [00:06:30]:
There are certain moments in times when those sorts of things are trending, so it's not necessarily evergreen. Also looking at news articles, things that are happening in the news, sometimes these can be evergreen, but a lot of times they're not. So let's take a look at some specific examples of evergreen content. We're talking about a podcast where you are featured as a guest, something that you can bring back time and time again. We're talking about a tip of the day where you are answering a question that you often get. We're talking about a group of quotes that maybe typically get the higher engagement when you talk about these things, or perhaps a post that promotes your lead magnet. We're talking about a reminder to subscribe to your podcast. This is a really great one to bring back time and again.

Andréa Jones [00:07:15]:
Any reviews or testimonials of your products or your services, you can definitely bring those back again, and cross promoting other platforms. So if you're on Instagram and LinkedIn, you can post to Instagram and say, hey, did you know we're on LinkedIn? So in order to kind of establish yourself with this evergreen content strategy, there are 3 things that you need to have in place. A content planning tool, which I'll show you my tool that I use in a moment. Honestly, though, this could be as simple as a Google document. It doesn't need to be super complicated, but you just you basically need a place to save your evergreen content. You'll also need to identify what types of content pillars you're gonna share. So I like to put these into different buckets. So maybe I have one Google Doc that has a bunch of testimonials that I can reuse time and time again.

Andréa Jones [00:08:03]:
Maybe I have another Google document with some of the quotes and things that I say. Maybe I have another Google document with all of my media features and podcast place placements and things like that. So identify what themes or pillars of content that you're gonna revisit time and again, and then you need a little bit of time. So while this strategy saves you time in the long run, in the short term, you're going to need a little bit of time to set this up. So I wanna show you a few examples of this. This is one of my clients, she podcasts, and every single week, they do a podcast support thread where they just say, hey, what's coming up for you this week on your podcast? It's a really great way to encourage engagement. You can see here that they get quite a number of people responding. There's lots of conversations happening around this question.

Andréa Jones [00:08:52]:
It's very simple. We post it every single week. Sometimes, we may switch it up with a different emoji, a different GIF. Sometimes we'll maybe add something topical to it, like, what's happening this week over Christmas break or something like that. So we but we keep the general theme of this question the same, and our audience has come to expect it. Here's another way that you could do evergreen content. So as I mentioned, you could just put this in a Google Doc. I hosted a workshop.

Andréa Jones [00:09:23]:
No thanks. I hosted a workshop at one point, put together some Facebook ad copy, and I was like, this is actually pretty good. So I wanna keep using this for this workshop. And, you can see I just typed it up in a Google Doc, but then I took it to my content planning tool. So I use a tool called Airtable. If you Google Airtable with my name, Online Drea, you'll see tons of like, I have tons of tutorials about how I use this, but I wanted to show you this post specifically. So I'm gonna just copy this piece, raise your hand if, and I'm gonna just search it on the right hand side, just so you can see how I created this evergreen content, and I'm reusing it. So you can see here, I posted it on July 23rd, which was around the first time I hosted this workshop.

Andréa Jones [00:10:10]:
Here's the whole post here. Okay? So I've got it planned out, and you can also see the graphic here that I used with it. So this is the the graphic that I used with it. Now I hosted this workshop 2 or 3 more times, and I used this post again. So this one says July 23rd. You can also see this on November 23rd, so same post, change the emojis a little bit, change this graphic here. Okay? And then I also used it again on May 28th, same post, and I used a different photo with it. So you can see how I created this once, and I'm reusing it time and again as I taught teach this workshop, to get people into my mentorship program.

Andréa Jones [00:10:56]:
So that's an example of how you can leverage ever an evergreen content strategy. Let's talk about the second way that you can build out and reuse and remix your content, and we're using the content remixing strategy. This is one of my favorite ways to maximize your content and to really work hard once. So when we're thinking about content remixing, this is taking your primary content, your thoughts, your framework, and your approach, and repeating it over and over and over again. So when we think about this concept, I want you to think about this like a commercial jingle. So when you hear a commercial, maybe it's Folgers, maybe it's Liberty, I don't know. I don't I should probably stop name dropping these things. But they all have jingles.

Andréa Jones [00:11:47]:
Right? And they kind of pop into your head. Allstate, Sleep Country. Right? All of these commercials we've heard over the years all have little jingles, and we kinda know what they sound like. And that's because we've heard the jingle over and over again. Even though the content of the commercial may look a little bit different, maybe they use a different, story, maybe they use a different voice, maybe they use a different host, but the the core jingle remains the same. So I want you to start thinking about how you can create the commercial jingle version of your marketing messages. And we call this in my program, the Savvy Social School, we call this your digital brain. So your digital brain.

Andréa Jones [00:12:34]:
I want you to start building out a digital brain. And a digital brain is essentially a database of your core content and messages. It's what you want to be known for. And when we think about our digital brain, it can live anywhere, but essentially, it's the home base of your core content and your core concepts. So if you're just starting out, oftentimes, these are client and customer conversations. If a client or customer comes to you, you're probably saying the same things over and over again. If they ask you about your service, your offer, if they're asking you for a sales pitch, if they're asking you to walk through your products, this is your digital brain. It currently lives in a conversation form with your clients, but it's there.

Andréa Jones [00:13:23]:
When you start building out your brand online, you want your digital brain to live other places so that you don't have to have these conversations all the time. People can go and find these. So this can be a blog post, for instance. So a conversation you had with a customer or client can turn into a blog post. Any future customer or client then reads that blog post and they get access to that content. My favorite way of doing this is podcasts. I am more of a talker than a writer, and so I love to have my digital brain live in a podcast episode. And how I approach this is I, plan out my podcast episodes and that is where my content lives and then I repurpose it.

Andréa Jones [00:14:04]:
And I'll show you what that looks like. This can be interviews. It can be media placements, course material, even talks or workshops. You kinda get the point. So when you have your digital brain, you then wanna break this down into a bunch of different ways. So there's a lot of things here. I'm just gonna cherry pick a few examples. So if you're thinking about a podcast episode, maybe you're pulling a quote from that episode.

Andréa Jones [00:14:30]:
If you did an expert interview, maybe you're gonna take the story that you told in that interview and turn it into a video. Or maybe you're teaching a local workshop, and so you could talk about on social media some of the key points, a testimonial from the workshop, or if a client had a conversation. You can illustrate your client's success through storytelling on social media. So this is an example working hard once and having it maximized for you. Awesome. Alright. So the last way that I wanna talk about reusing past posts, or the last strategy, the last remixing strategy is reusing past posts. Now I've kind of touched on this a little bit already, but I wanna talk about how, how to do this and some things to be mindful of.

Andréa Jones [00:15:16]:
So when we're reposting things on social media, when we're reposting content, I do suggest having at least 90 days between posting. Many platforms like Twitter, for instance, I know for sure does this, if you try to post the same exact thing at the same time or with within a similar time frame, they will suspend your account because that has been now labeled spam and kind of they kind of have a trigger system for that. Okay? So I suggest waiting at least 90 days. I also like this strategy because a lot of times our audiences are shifting every 90 days. We have new people coming in consistently, and our current audience doesn't necessarily remember what we said. I know I don't know about you, but I don't remember what I saw on social media earlier today, much less 90 days ago. So I do recommend revisiting your content every 90 days and seeing what you can repost. Just straight up repost.

Andréa Jones [00:16:13]:
You wanna make sure that the themes match and that they make sense. So when we're talking about that evergreen content, you know, you wanna make sure when you're reposting it, it makes sense for the time that you're reposting it in. If there's current events that are happening, you wanna be very mindful of this. And I used to suggest a lot of tools that would automatically repost content for you. I don't recommend those anymore for this reason. The state of the world is a little bit sensitive, and we wanna be mindful to kind of not being, insensitive with the things that we're posting on social media. And then lastly, you can update your post if needed. Honestly, I like to add in something current, fresh it up freshen it up a little bit, maybe change out the photo, maybe add in a few different emojis or some context to what's happening in the world.

Andréa Jones [00:17:05]:
And this is again why I don't like just straight up reposting it, but I like to see, some different themes and different things going on. K? So here's an example of how one of my clients does this, where they, put this in a Google Doc, Google spreadsheet, and you can see how they've got the lead magnets here, the blog posts, and they've got a few different captions. I think this is, like, 4 or 5 different captions for each one. So, again, work hard once, and then they just rotate through these. And by the time you rotate through these, you actually probably have a year's worth of content just in this blog post category. Okay? So this is an example of how you can refresh, repost content, and still keep things fresh. Okay? So you could just simply take the exact same post, copy and paste it every 90 days or as needed, and then you can just work hard once. Alright.

Andréa Jones [00:18:08]:
So I wanna show an example of one of our clients. This is, Carla Lowenthal. She is a feminist life coach, and this is pulled from her podcast. So everything that's written here in this post came from something she said in a podcast episode. And, actually, Cara does not post on social media. She does she does her stories. But if you go look at her social media post, this is how you can start, kind of outsourcing it. She says everything in her podcast, in her coaching programs, and then my team and I comb through that and create content pieces from it that are very storytelling, that are very personalized, but she only works hard once with their her core content.

Andréa Jones [00:18:50]:
K? Here's another example of that. This is my client, Linda. This is actually a stat that we've posted several times. We just kinda redesigned the graphic over and over, but this is something that she said in her, podcasts. And she uses storytelling and tells different stories about it. And this one, we're actually promoting her Facebook live that night. And so we're able to use this content as a way to, like, releverage it and tell more stories and still promote her new content pieces. Let's talk a little bit about tweeting.

Andréa Jones [00:19:27]:
I've mentioned this before, but you can't just copy and paste the same post to Twitter. So be very careful of this when you are reusing past post. Here are a few rules to keep in mind. You can create variations of the captions like I showed you. You can create variations on the graphic, add emojis, use a different call to action. This is my favorite. So if they're saying, you know, visit this blog post, maybe check out this plot blog blog post. It could be anything.

Andréa Jones [00:19:59]:
Turn a question into a statement, anything like that. So here's another example of this. This is a post that, same promotion actually for that workshop. I just updated it. I posted it once July 2020, and then again in March 2021. And the content is the same except I was 6.5 years in July, and then I breached 7 years by March. And so that's what I updated in the post, and you can see I used a different photo for this post. And, yeah, I think it could be very helpful for both the post that didn't perform well and the posts that did.

Andréa Jones [00:20:41]:
K? So I touched on a lot of things in today's session. And if you're wondering about any more foundational concepts to social media or if you want some of swipe files to get going on to that next level of your growth, I invite you to check out my free course. It's called the social media rock star course, and it comes with a PDF that helps you, design your daily content outline. It comes with some super short packed trainings, that are so, so valuable for, kind of giving you the foundation for social media. It's pulled straight from my program, so you're getting all the best bits for free. And then I also included some bonuses. So I've got some graphic design, templates for you, and I also have some social media caption swipe files. So if you get stuck with either the design or the caption, I got you.

Andréa Jones [00:21:35]:
You can simply copy and paste it into your own tool and start working away and get started faster with social media strategies. You could check that out with the link that goes along with this video or you can visit onlinedrea.com/free. That's onlinedrea.com/free. Thank you so much for joining me today. I will see you soon.

**Transcript:**
Liz Stapleton [00:00:00]:
Guys, I'm really excited for this session with Ben from, the cofounder of DollarSprout, who's gonna be talking some SEO tips. Welcome, Ben. Thank you so much for doing this.

Ben Huber [00:00:08]:
Yes. Thank you for having me, Liz. I appreciate you taking the time to chat a little bit of SEO with me tonight.

Liz Stapleton [00:00:14]:
Yeah. Because, I mean, SEO is one of those things that when you start blogging, you don't necessarily know a lot about it, but you quickly realize that it's something you need to know more about.

Ben Huber [00:00:23]:
Mhmm.

Liz Stapleton [00:00:24]:
You know, and then and then you start digging into it, and it can be extremely overwhelming. So why don't you give us kind of the highlights of what you're gonna cover?

Ben Huber [00:00:32]:
Yeah. Sure. So like you said, I mean, I think it's one of those things where we all, you know, get into blogging. We're we're all gung ho about getting started, and we we kind of learn the basics of creating content and then we begin to learn there's this whole other side of of marketing your content. So it's like, if you build it, they may or may not come. And the may or may not come turns into how do I actually get them to come. And I think that, obviously, there's so many different strategies we can use, you know, for traffic acquisition, SEO being one of them. If you've have come from a background or you've done, like, paid media acquisition, so you're paying for people to come to your site or you just rock on Pinterest or you do YouTube.

Ben Huber [00:01:10]:
But for us and for, you know, what we've done on DollarSprout, a lot of our successes has come from search. We we basically take a reader's question and we we try to answer it with our content. And so as you, you know, kind of get further into your blogging journey, I think that part of being a well rounded Blogger, you know, kind of just means it's it's a component of of traffic acquisition. I need to learn the strategy and I and at at some point, I'm gonna try to master it. And I think for us, that's something that we've done done a good job doing. And so, you know, one of the things about search or search algorithms in general is that they're ever changing, and I think that that is something that a lot of, you know, bloggers struggle with is it's frustrating, you know, to see

Liz Stapleton [00:01:50]:
You finally get a handle on something and then the the sand shifts beneath you.

Ben Huber [00:01:54]:
Yep. Yep. And another and then another instances, I think that's something a lot of bloggers struggle with is they learn something and then they don't ever evolve. I think that, you know, they they learned it this way and they're stubborn and they don't wanna change. And so something that I really, you know, feel strongly about is is just being open minded and I think, like, you you learn Let's

Liz Stapleton [00:02:12]:
go with your strategy.

Ben Huber [00:02:13]:
Yep. Exactly. And I think that, you know, especially in this upcoming year, just how and taking a look back in 2019, just how often they're changing their algorithm, you really do have to, like, kind of stay abreast of of what's changing and what are they really trying, you know, to to get at. What do they how are they improving the quality of their search algorithms? And so the, you know, the thing that I wanna talk about is, you know or at least the 5 things I really wanna cover in my presentation are are ways that you can stay on top of those changes, and, like and then that's it's one of those things where you're trying to stay on top of them, and then further furthermore, you're trying to kind of guess what they're where they're going in the new year. And so what I did was I kind of took a step back and I said, Right, what, you know, how are they changing? What are what are they telling us? And then, you know, what what's kind of implied. And so the 5 things that I really wanna, you know, impress upon people, especially Blogger's that are looking into SEO, are, I guess, are just one of a few things. 1, you know, Google is looking into kind of the uniqueness of your Right. That was, like, the first, you know, point that I really wanna harp on.

Ben Huber [00:03:19]:
Just building trust, so they trust you. They they want, you know, to send readers to your site, how to build relevant content, how we can optimize our site to to get Google to send people there, and then providing a good user experience once they're there. So it's kind of this continuum of of SEO in the sense that you wanna to not only optimize your site, but then provide a good user experience when you get there. So that's kind of that that's shifting how, you know, Google perceives that user experience to be. It has shifted a lot in 2019 and it's going to shift even further in 2020. And so part of our, you know, my work for this presentation was was figuring out where they wanna go and how we can optimize our sites better for the future. So

Liz Stapleton [00:04:01]:
Yeah. I'm I'm excited to dive into this. I think it's gonna mesh really well with all the other sessions we've got. We've got a lot of sessions on content creation in terms of storytelling.

Ben Huber [00:04:11]:
Sure. You know,

Liz Stapleton [00:04:11]:
that's that's what makes it unique, because anyone can write a post of 70 side hustles or whatever. It's how do you inject uniqueness into that that's gonna make it stand out, you know, and and and your site in general. So, yeah. So I'm excited. Let's let's get to it.

Ben Huber [00:04:26]:
Sure. Thanks for being patient with me as I kinda switch gears here into actual presentation mode. I'm really excited to spend a few minutes today talking about my personal favorite blogging topic, which is SEO, and more specifically, how changes in SEO in 2019 kind of impact our best practice for 2020. So what I've done is I've put together a slide deck of about 20 slides or so that highlight 5 of the biggest changes that occurred in 2019 and how we can kind of interpret those changes and use the information we gathered from them to kind of shape best practice for 2020. So if you're a beginner blogger, you're probably gonna get a ton of value out of this. If you're an intermediate blogger and even advanced blogger, there's still a lot here that I think that you're gonna be able to take away from it and kind of apply again to your content marketing strategy moving forward. So what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna open up the presentation here. I'm actually gonna minimize myself off this screen, and I'm gonna go through the slides here starting now.

Ben Huber [00:05:22]:
Alright. So I've got my presentation open here, and I'm gonna head to this first slide. And I wanted to start everything off by talking a little bit about the state of search and why it's still meaningful and relevant as a part of our content marketing strategy, especially for a lot of bloggers that start kind of on the social side of things and kind of learn about SEO and aren't aren't really sure what it is or why it's important. I think that a few of these statistics will kind of highlight just how dominant it is in our in our online marketing experience. And so, again, for the first tidbit on here, it might surprise some of you to know that 51% of all web traffic starts with an organic search, which is a fairly high number when you kind of consider the emergence of social into the scene over the last 10 years or so. I think that I think smartphones kind of appeared in the 2,009 range. And then since then, they've kind of dominated a lot of the marketing headlines that we've seen. But again, 51% of of all web experiences start with organic searches still.

Ben Huber [00:06:24]:
So a huge market, in terms of finding your ideal readers. That kind of brings me to my second point, is that organic search is still by far the best way to really hone in on your ideal reader. If you are writing a piece of content that solves their problem or is even if it's entertainment value, whatever the case may be, you are kind of reaching your ideal avatar because they have already expressed interest in the topic that you're writing on. So if you are appealing to customers on search, you might be at the mercy of the news feed and hoping that they match the intent of a person on the news feed to your content, whereas with search, they have already told Google that they're interested in your content, and now they're matching it to you. So if you are looking for people that are lukewarm or even warm when it comes to a marketing or funnel perspective, these readers are are already there. There doesn't take much to introduce them to your brand and and kind of adopt them into your audience. So organic search is a really powerful tool for attracting your your ideal avatar or your ideal reader. And then last but not least, SEO is one of the few remaining free platforms for acquiring your audience and volume.

Ben Huber [00:07:39]:
So if you think about it over the last 10 years or so, there's been a little bit of a consolidation, especially amongst big tech, where companies like Facebook have been acquiring Instagram. They've acquired other smaller social platforms. And so there's this kind of consolidation amongst big tech, where there's only so many mediums for distributing your content. And so if you take a wide angle lens at it, you've got organic search. You've got organic social, which are the social platforms, you've got email marketing, and then you've got paid acquisition channels. So 4 real big ways to get people back on-site, but the vast majority of them are coming through search. So if you haven't started on SEO and you're looking for a place to get started, some of these tips are maybe more intermediate in nature, and you might need to kind of hone in on the basics. But come back to this presentation down the road because these are gonna be crucial to kind of your overall journey in search.

Ben Huber [00:08:35]:
Move to this next slide here. And, yeah, just to highlight just how quickly search changes, if you weren't already aware, and I think a lot of you probably already are just from being in the blogging circles, Google dominates the search kind of niche. And it's highlighted best by the fact that they ascertain almost 92% of all the search volume that occurs on search engines. So when you hear people say they're optimizing for Google, they're truly optimizing for SEO, it just happens to be that Google is the biggest player in our space. And that, again, is highlighted by the fact of just how frequently they're changing their search algorithms. So 9 updates a day, which is an astonishing number. They're constantly trying to tinker and improve their product, which is kind of benefits the the end reader, and webmasters just have to kind of stay a a bridge of all these changes. And then last but not least, kind of before we start to dive into the actual changes that of note in 2019, is just to kind of understand a little bit about where these companies are coming from.

Ben Huber [00:09:43]:
They're constantly trying to balance creating a better product with generating revenue. And so that kind of manifest manifests itself in a couple ways. I think with with Google specifically, you've seen the adaptation of zero click search in the last year, which is one of the bigger trends that actually didn't, highlight much in this presentation. I know that Rob Powell talks about 0 click search in his, so if you're wondering what that is and why it's so important to SEO in 2020, go ahead and review that component of his presentation. Again, 0 click search, it's it's huge, and it's really reshaping the way that webmasters practice SEO. But for the purposes of this presentation, I tried to find 5 other areas or 5 other big changes that really highlight the direction that some of these search engines, especially Google, is taking. And so just kind of a fun factoid for you guys, at their core, these mediums or these content delivery mediums are really just massive ad delivery networks. It's the easiest and the best way for them to distribute their content.

Ben Huber [00:10:47]:
And so, again, these are Right recent numbers, but Facebook, at 99.8 percent of their 55,000,000,000 in revenue, was from delivering ads from advertisers, which is kind of an astonishing figure. And Google themselves, not not exactly diversified in their revenue streams as well, 85% of of which is is ad based. I know they've gotten into the physical realm of trying to distribute physical products, like Google Home and some of these other, you know, smart devices, but they're still still haven't gotten away from their identity of a basically, an advertising network. And my last piece of advice, again, just before we get into this stuff, is if you aren't already following educational sources, it's really important, as a kind of a well rounded blogger and that's trying to maintain kind of this omnichannel presence. It's really important for you to to, 1, not get complacent, but, 2, just become, like, a lifetime learner. Learn a little bit about search every day. And I think that, you know, a year from now, if you constantly have kind of subscribed to this drip of educational content from some of these sources, you will be a much more well rounded marketer. And so definitely subscribe to some of the channels that you see there and some of the people on Twitter, especially.

Ben Huber [00:12:07]:
SEOs are very, very present on Twitter. So if you kind of just check-in daily with some of your favorite figures, you are going to just grow leaps and bounds as a marketer. Alright. Let me pull up one more slide here. And so let me hide this here. Just so I think that Right might be showing on your guys' screen. But one of the biggest changes that we have seen happen in 2019 and then this is really something that's been talked about since the early 20teens think 2010 or so Google introduced the idea of speed being, like, an actual algorithm ranking factor. And they didn't exactly confirm it then, but they have confirmed it more recently.

Ben Huber [00:12:47]:
So 2018 or so, they finally came out and said speed is super important to the user experience. We are we are going to actually start including it into our our algorithm ranking characteristics. And so that became official in July of 2018, and they Google started to share some information about the user experience and how speed impacts it. And this data all comes from that original article that they published back on the Webmaster Blogger, or think with Google back in July of 2018. But you get an idea of just how slow the user experience can be on mobile. I think right there at 22 seconds is it's kind of an astonishing figure. If you were on your desktop, you would never wait 22 seconds for a page to load. And so why are we putting our mobile users through that same experience? It's one of those things where we tend to have broadband like connections on desktop, but the rest of the world is kind of lagging behind in terms of speed on mobile.

Ben Huber [00:13:53]:
So we've got 3 gs, which is transfers data at a much slower rate than 4 gs, and now we've got 5 gs emerging. But in any instance, we just don't have the speed or the ability to download these web pages at the same rate on mobile as we do on desktop. So they have straight out come out and said that speed is an incredibly important factor when it comes to the user experience. And how that affects us as marketers is more prevalent in how quickly someone bounces from your page. So if you see you're in Google Analytics. You've got that installed, and you see your bounce rates are super high. There's so many different ways to kind of diagnose why that's occurring. But one of them, or one of the explanations beyond your content not necessarily matching what the reader anticipated was, simply put, that your website is super slow.

Ben Huber [00:14:42]:
And so you can see just how high the percentage of bounce is for slow user experiences. So as the length of time it takes to load your page increases, so from 1 to 3 or 1 to 5 or even 1 to 10 seconds, the bounce rate almost increases exponentially. So if your page is taking more than 10 seconds to load, it is your bounce rate is a 100% higher, 123% higher than it was if it only took one second to load. So people are literally just not staying around to read your content. So speed is a super important metric, not only for user experience, but also if you want your blog to be successful. I found a statistic from Cloudflare, which is one of the largest CDN networks in the entire world, that really surprised me. And that was just how poorly conversion rates, I guess, drop or just how much they drop when speed incrementally increases. So from just 2.4 seconds to 5.7 seconds, which, again, if mobile is at a 20 second time frame, that's not a long period of time.

Ben Huber [00:15:45]:
Your conversion rates are dropping an enormous percentage. So if you've got a link that advertises an affiliate at the bottom of an article and it takes more than 5 seconds for your page to load, you're you're essentially dropping the number of people that click on that link by 300% just by having a slow user experience. So speed is incredibly important to how quickly someone is able to get to your page and kind of digest the content that's on it. And then these are a little more technical for for some of you that have may have may excuse me, may have larger sites. I know that one person I've audited in the past had a coupon site. They had over 20,000 URLs. And something worth noting is that if you have a slow user experience or slow load times, you are actually hurting your ability for your new content to actually rank. So if you're just beginning and your blog only has maybe 30 posts and you have nothing else on your site, probably not much to worry about.

Ben Huber [00:16:46]:
But if you're a little more established and you're kind of on the intermediate side of things and you've got a big site, you need to kind of start thinking about how not only does a slower website provide a poor user experience, but it also impacts the rate at which Google's crawl budget is allotted to your site. And so if you're struggling and you can't figure out why some of your content isn't reaching Google's index, that's one place that you can look. And then last but not least, poor website experience or slow loading times for your brand just look bad. And so if someone has been to your site a couple times and they realize that each and every time they come it's a miserable experience, they're becoming progressively less likely to start coming back. And so 2 of the big changes, and the reason I kind of included speed into this trend or change kind of the small changes that we've noticed over 2019 is that Google is literally telling us that it's an important, you know, factor. I think that that is one of the more obvious changes that we've noted over the years, is that they've actually changed your search console to incorporate a panel here. So you can see under the Enhancements tab that they've actually included a Knowledge Panel for webmasters almost that approaches broaches speed topics. And you can see that for our particular domain, we don't have any slow URLs.

Ben Huber [00:18:14]:
But if you do, if you are fortunate enough to have one in this spot right here, you may see in the coming release of Chrome, of their browser, that Google or Chrome is going to start actually warning people when they're about to hit a slow website. And so there is nothing that dooms a user experience or dooms your website more than this badge of shame, is kind of what they're calling it, than than a reader showing up and seeing that. And then the flip side is true. They're actually rewarding or showing when a website wins or reloads faster. So you may see a green progress bar appear, kind of up here at the top, for sites that are known to have a good user experience or load quickly. And so that kind of brings me to how to know or how to identify if your website is loading slowly. And there, I've included a slide here that kind of is something that I think everyone can get a little bit out of. And even if you're a total beginner and you're just not really sure that if your site is slow, it may load fast enough to you on desktop, say 2 or 3 seconds, but you're not quite sure how well you're doing on mobile, there's a couple of quick things that you can look for to kind of clue you in to whether or not your page might be loading really slowly for your users.

Ben Huber [00:19:35]:
And so if you're using Chrome or any browser if you're not using Chrome, you may have to Google how to get to some of your dev tool options. But if you're in Chrome, you can just hit control shift I, and this little network tab is gonna pop up for you. And you can just refresh your page. And actually, there's a toggle button. I actually don't have it on the screenshot, but there's a toggle button that says disable cache. And you wanna click that and reload your page. And what you can do is you can sort this Network tab by size, and it'll show you if you have any assets on a page that might be really big and slowing down, you know, your overall user experience. And so this entire column that I have circled here, it all adds up to this figure right here.

Ben Huber [00:20:20]:
This is the transfer amount. And Right now, it's showing 500 kilobytes, which is not quite 1 megabyte. It's not about halfway to 1 megabyte. And Google has told us, just based off their massive index, that the average web page is about 2.2 megabytes. So if you think about it, it's a really easy way to kind of remember it all. The average 2.2 megabyte page takes about 22 seconds to load. And so if anything you can do to get your overall page weight below 2.2 megabytes is sure to help your reader get to your content even faster. So there's I've got a list here coming up of things that you can actually do to lower your page weight.

Ben Huber [00:21:05]:
But this is just an easy way in the dev tools to identify if you've got a really large page where problems may exist. So you can kind of get a wealth of information here. You can see that we have 33 requests, which is fairly low. You might see that you have 100 or 200 or even 5 or 800 if you're using an ad network, and that's just the number of times that a user has to basically query your server in order to get all the information they need to see the page. And so the lower that number in general, the better. But even for some of you that have higher numbers here, there's a lot that you can do to kind of expedite or speed up the process for how quickly someone can render your page. But this is just an easy way right here to see how big your page is. And for our particular dev environment right here I've got actually our test site open you can see that the pay the typical user is usually able to start seeing our content here within the first one second, which is really important because it shows the reader that the page is loading.

Ben Huber [00:22:08]:
And I've got another slide here that has 2 URLs where you can start running some of your web pages into these tools just to give you an idea of of how your site is performing. And so the first one is just Google PageSpeed Insights, which is Google's provided tool, and then a third party one here, which is webpagetest webpagetest.org, which is another, again, a third party tool that helps you identify problems that you may have when it comes to the speed of your site or your user experience. And so a couple things of note here. First off oops. I went too far in my presentation here. You want to do a couple things here. You want to actually test a blog post versus a home page. So you might it might not hurt to get your home page or maybe a category page as kind of a baseline or a control for how fast your site is.

Ben Huber [00:23:04]:
But when you're actually testing what a user is going through, it's really important to actually test a post. And so what I've done here is I've actually went through in our dev environment and tested a post to see what the user is actually seeing. And we have done extensive manipulation to our rendering experience to try to speed up just how quickly a user is is seeing our content or this time to interactive, which is the first time that they can actually start interacting with the page. And so we have our scores kind of maxed out. But this is something that, again, if you're a beginner or an intermediate blogger, this is a pretty big investment into your site that you're going to want to make down the road just because these speeds are impacting your bounce rates, your time to interactives, and just how quickly people are, in fact, able to interact with your site. So what I've done is I've put together a list here of things that pretty much any blogger can address to Right to ensure that the average user that comes to your site is going to have a good experience. So I've ranked them from easy to implement to some of the more harder ones to implement. That way, you can use this as a frame of reference or a checklist for addressing speed problems that you may have with your site.

Ben Huber [00:24:21]:
So the first thing and probably the more most common thing I see is just uncompressed images. And so if you've been blogging for a little while, you probably know that you need to use a tool to compress your images so that the file sizes are not exceeding, on average, probably a 100 kilobytes or so. I think that if you properly resize and re compress excuse me. If you resize and upload the correct file extension for for your images. So usually, a JPEG versus a PNG or something like that, you're gonna have betterly betterly better compressed images that that reduce the overall file size and the amount of time it takes for a reader to render them. And then some other things that you can address to speed up your user experience is caching, gzip and Right compression, minification, and CDNs. These are all things that you may have various levels of comfort with. And if you're not uncomfortable if you are comfortable with them, you may want to outsource to a 3rd party.

Ben Huber [00:25:23]:
You can typically find someone that knows what they're doing to kind of address all of these things for about $50 to $200 or so. And I can actually probably put in the show notes a URL or a couple links to people, that I know that provide this service for a reasonable rate. That way, again, if you don't feel comfortable making some of these changes, you can consider making that investment into your blog and and outsourcing it to them. And then for some of you that have been around a while and you've taken care of the top five things there, if you really want to get granular and try to reduce your time to interactives a little bit lower, you can look into better hosting and really addressing some of the granular scripts that are slowing things down so removing render blocking CSS and JavaScript, maybe hosting third party scripts on your own server. That way, you don't have to rely on a third party to render your page. Sometimes if a plug in fails or a script fails, your user may not be able to render your site at all. So that's something that you can look forward to down the road, but if you can basically address anything and everything on this list, you're gonna be well positioned to provide a good user experience. And so the the second trend that we've really noticed in 2019 that I think Google is trying to really hammer home here is your the uniqueness of your site really matters.

Ben Huber [00:26:54]:
So since 2013 and, really, especially in 2015 with Brian Dean kind of coining this whole skyscraper technique thing, it became a way for bloggers to create progressively better content than competitors for a particular query. And so what we began to see in the mid, you know, 20teens here is bloggers creating these mega guides targeting specific keywords in the hopes that Google would recognize that their piece of content was better than what was out there. And that kind of lent itself to having these really, really long blog posts that maybe were a little bit superfluous or fluff in some aspects, and wasn't just necessarily better content for the reader. And what I think you're going to start to see in 2020, especially, is that that is no longer gonna fly. People don't have the attention spans to really stick around for that period of time and before they bounce and get uninterested with your content. And the reason that I included this slide in here is because, specifically, some changes that we saw Google make in 2019 to their QRGs or their Quality Rater Guidelines that where they added a one word term to a section of the QRGs that really kind of caught some people off guard, and that is they really want content to be unique. Not just original, but unique. And the way that we're interpreting that is that it's not enough for your content to necessarily be original.

Ben Huber [00:28:34]:
They want stuff that doesn't appear in 5,000 other places on the web. And so if your entire strategy revolves around targeting specific queries and writing content for it, you're not doing anything that's entirely unique. Your content may be original, and you might have original thought in each particular, post that you write, but there's nothing necessarily unique about what you're doing. And so just be sure that you are not only writing content to satisfy user queries or questions, but you're also producing content that is unique and wholly unique to your brand. And I think I highlight that a little bit here on this next slide, where I talk about the differences of uniqueness. So you've got page level page level differences, which is, again, what I was referring to, in the sense that you might create a better guide than another blogger on how to make spaghetti. But that only kind of pertains to the page level differences between your site. And really, what I think Google is getting at here is that they want to see kind of sitewide differences and internet wide differences between what you're writing and what your competitors are writing.

Ben Huber [00:29:51]:
So just adding value beyond, just what you're writing on a daily basis. I'm gonna take a sip of water here. Excuse me. And so there's a couple ways that you can do that. Obviously, one is to make sure that each article on your own site is unique so you're not copying content from or even paraphrasing content from article to article, especially when you're targeting similar keywords. They want to see that everything that you place on your site is an original piece of content that's unique to you and preferably unique to the Internet. So I think that that's something that you're really gonna start Google start to see Google focus on, almost like they did with Panda when they went after content farms that were just republishing stuff over and over that was pretty thin. I think that you're gonna start to see Google start to suppress sites that don't publish unique content.

Ben Huber [00:30:49]:
So just something to keep in mind if your if your only content marketing strategy is search related. Just make sure that your content is unique enough, that it you're not just offering the same thing that other bloggers are are offering to the world. And one thing that you can do to kind of combat that is to run not only your own content through plagiarism checkers to kind of kind of cross reference your content across your own site, but also these same plagiarism checkers can be used to scan the web and make sure that your content isn't too closely related to another piece of content on the web. And the next trend that I wanted to get into a little bit was specifically branding. I think that we've seen this emergence of of what it means to Google to show brands on SERPs or search engine response pages. And we think that while it's not necessarily, excuse me, a direct ranking factor to be a brand, brands possess a lot of the qualities that Google is looking for when it comes to being a trusted source for content. So Google isn't directly ranking or using their algorithm to isolate and show brands, brands just happen to check off a lot of boxes when it comes to upping the trust factor for their content. And so one of the things I wanted to highlight was just how difficult it is to kind of become a brand.

Ben Huber [00:32:19]:
I think that as a new blogger, you hear about SEO, you hear about how important it is to start building links to your site, And then you begin to realize how long of a journey it is to becoming a brand, so to speak. And so the reason Google really likes to lean heavily on these brands is just the fact that it's hard to fake it. You can fake or build a single link. You can build dozens or even hundreds of links. But it's extremely hard to build a brand that has thousands of linking domains, all of which have, like, positive external context. So if people are complaining about your brand, that might not go in your favor. But if people are constantly praising not only the content that you're publishing, but the user experience that you're providing all the way down to your sales funnel and the customer service that you're providing. If it's all shown in a positive context, Google says, hey, we can really trust the site.

Ben Huber [00:33:16]:
They've been around for a long time. All the external sources that point to them suggest that this particular brand or entity is trustworthy. And, hey, maybe that means something about the content they're writing. Maybe we can place a little more trust in in the content that that these people or this person is publishing. And so your goal as a beginner or even an intermediate blogger is to kind of start trending in this direction. It's not an overnight process. You're not going to become the next Apple overnight. But every day, just thinking about the ways in which you can self brand or self promote yourself and and the implications or the reactions that people are having to it across the web.

Ben Huber [00:33:58]:
And so, specifically, we've seen Google start to make changes to their layout that highlight how much or how important it is to be a brand. And so one of the first things that we've seen on mobile, especially in 2019, and they actually just introduced it in the January core update here in 2020 was the addition of your actual icon or insignia or logo, whatever you want to call it, to their actual SERPs. So they're making it easier for readers to pick out or point to brands or trusted brands. That way, they can immediately go to their content. So DollarSprout, our personal site, happens to be in the in the personal finance sector. And if you've been spent any time in this niche, there are a couple brands that really stick out, and you can kind of know and trust them as reputable sources for information. And so by including their icon in front of their search result, it just makes it a lot easier to to kind of navigate a reader to something that they know is trustworthy. And so and then the other component to this, and this is something that Google talks a little bit about in their QRGs as well, is brands are really important because they stand in front of your content.

Ben Huber [00:35:12]:
So if an author or a publisher of an article is not easily discernible or not even listed, or that particular author may not have a large web presence and they're not necessarily trustworthy, then the brand itself stands in front of the content on that page. So that's just one thing to think about is if you have an author that writes for your blog or you, brand signals tell Google just how trustworthy the content is on this page. So just something to think about as your brand grows is that if you're not sure if an author is trustworthy or you're just not sure first off, that content may or may not you may or may not want to have that on your site. But just know that your brand is how Google is interpreting whether or not they should trust the content on that page. And so just a couple things that you can do here to kind of promote your brand or or signal to Google that your brand is something that's growing and emerging, is, one, you can just query or search for your own brand name, and it'll show you if you're using any sort of, tool, like Keywords Everywhere or something like that. You can actually see how often people are searching for your brand each month. And if you have a few hundred or even a few thousand, searches for your brand each and every month, that's basically signaling to Google that people not only are interested in your content, but they're they're coming back for more for some reason or another. And that's just a powerful signal for them to know that people are truly interested in what you have to say.

Ben Huber [00:37:03]:
And the way that you can kind of increase your branded queries is to get people back on-site or just basically constantly and subtly be in your reader's mind. And so there's a few ways to do that. Email marketing is a great way to get people back on-site, just like paid acquisition, where you're actually going out and you're spending, you know, essentially what amounts to ad revenue excuse me, not ad revenue ad spend on getting readers back on your site. And you can do that through a pixel. There's a ton of good resources on the Internet about how to install a pixel that kind of tracks some of your readers, and and then you can retarget to them or remarket to them on their other platforms. That's a good way to get people back on-site. You can encourage people to bookmark or set their home page to your site. And then there's a litany of other ways that you can kind of think out of the box to get people back on your site.

Ben Huber [00:38:01]:
I know that, again, in our niche of personal finance, one that I've seen recently is is NerdWallet actually started running commercials where they have a jingle that kind of subtly suggests to a listener that they can go to NerdWallet to get all of the answers to their questions so their tagline is actually turn to the nerds, which is I think is a great tagline because it basically implies that each and every time you have a question about personal finance or credit cards or whatever it is that you're interested in, you can turn to the nerds, so to speak, or turn to NerdWallet for that answer. So that's just a marketing tactic that they're using that I think is subtle and may go unnoticed, but it's a good way to increase their branded volume and kinda strengthen their brand. And then, next up, I have you kind of, you know, want to I guess, most simply stop boring your readers, or utilize more multimedia. So Google has signaled that the user experience is enhanced by including certain objects on your page. And, in fact, even in Search Console, you they list certain features as enhancements because Google recognizes that by including them on your page, the user is going to be more interested in what you have to say. And it's another way to kind of differentiate yourself with competitors. And then another pro or a byproduct of using multimedia is that it it it Right engages your readers better, and it's just more enjoyable to read than a massive wall of text. And so by including perhaps a podcast embed or a video embed or an interactive chart or anything other than just text, you enhance the retention rate of what a reader kind of takes away from your page.

Ben Huber [00:39:59]:
So I actually went and found a stat that kinda blew my mind as well, where the Institute of Applied Behavioral Science said that the learning that a reader goes through is a 100% more effective when you include these sorts of multimedia into your pages. So just find ways to get creative about including more things into your site or into your content. And so there is a dual purpose here in including multimedia into your content beyond just making it easier for someone to read or engage with, and that's that Google is actually highlighting these pieces of multimedia in search. So if you have a piece of embedded video, for example, into your content that's not available on Google or excuse me, on YouTube or anywhere else, and you use video object schema to tell Google what your video is about, there is a chance that Google will adopt that schema and show your video on search engine or excuse me, response pages, for a particular query. So if you write a article in this example, how to link build with Google Sheets, and then shoot a video on link building with Google Sheets, there's a chance that not only will your organic results, so your page itself will show up in the search engine response pages but the video will be highlighted in one of these video carousels. And this particular video carousel is at the top of the page on Google. So that's not something that you will see with every query, but there are certain especially how to queries we're starting to see video snippets or video carousels showing up for for these particular, queries. And so again, this particular slide just highlights the importance of video as a function of multimedia and how effective it is at reaching your audience, and just how important video is to Google, just where it is one of the largest platforms for content consumption.

Ben Huber [00:42:01]:
So they are very much highlighting video in their search engine response pages, and it will do you well to include some of them, embedded in your post. And then sorry. My sound went out there for a second. But another thing I was gonna mention is that leveraging med excuse me, multimedia has become easier than ever just with the adoption of or improvement of some of the content management systems that we're using. So WordPress actually announced that they're gonna make lazy loading a default feature in WordPress here coming up shortly, which is great because now you can include 10 or 20 or even 30 images into a single post without it taking forever to load. So you'll still wanna you'll still wanna make sure that your your images are compressed and that they're small enough that a person on a mobile device can quickly render the page. But it is reassuring to know that they are making the tech side of things even more friendly for the lay user. So basically, you can incorporate a lot of multimedia into your posts without fear of the mobile user being impacted by rendering a ton of images.

Ben Huber [00:43:22]:
And then last but not least, one of the bigger changes that we have seen, especially towards the tail end of 2019 here, I think in November, Google has re established the importance of a good user experience or encouraging good behavior. So the analogy or the reference that I chose here was nothing kills a party faster than when people leave early. So if you've ever been at a party and people start leaving, that is pretty much the end of that particular party. And then the same kind of goes for your website. You know, nothing torches your rankings faster than when people leave your site earlier. So kind of getting back to that speed component of it, that's one way to make sure that people don't leave. The other way to make sure that people don't leave is to ensure that the promise that you're delivering in the search engines, so that your title and your meta description, actually deliver on what a user is going to see when they land on your website. And if you deliver on that promise, you're going to start to see lower bounce rates and longer dwell times, so the longer session durations, because people are actually getting what they want when they come to your site.

Ben Huber [00:44:31]:
And so one of the biggest changes that we saw in November of 2019 was Google introduced their new machine learning component to their algorithm, which is known as BERT. And BERT is actually being used in tandem with another algorithm they released in the 20 teens named RankBrain. And those 2 kind of machine learning capabilities are used to determine whether or not the piece of content that you're providing matches what a user is actually searching for. So they're matching user intent to text on a page. And what this is doing is it basically ensures that when a reader or a user types something into Google, they're getting something that's actually relevant to them and not just a page that is stuffed with keywords that was meant to kind of gain the system so that readers would come and land there. And what that ends up doing is it ends up providing a better user experience because they're better matching content that people are actually reading and they're sticking around for. And it just overall is a good synergy between piece of content and reader experience. So unless you're a data science, you don't really truly data scientist, you don't truly need to understand the nuances of BERT.

Ben Huber [00:45:54]:
You just need to know that Google is getting better at understanding and processing text and natural language versus relying on keyword matching. And the best news that you hear all day in terms of SEO is that you don't actually need to optimize for BERT in any way. You just kind of go about incorporating more natural conversational copywriting into your content, and you don't necessarily have to worry so much about matching content to keywords in that undesirable situation of where where you have a sentence that just doesn't read the way you want it to because you're trying to smash a keyword in there. That is something that is becoming less and less important as Google gets better at interpreting what a page is about or what the text on a page is about. And one way that you can get really granular and improve your content so that people are sticking around longer is to maybe consider something like Google Tag Manager. And using Google Tag Manager to specifically track, when people are dropping off a page. So scroll depth tracking. So this is something that maybe some of the beginner bloggers may find confusing, and you may want to reserve this for when you're a little bit further into your blogging journey.

Ben Huber [00:47:13]:
But if you have a page that's ranking well and you wanna make credible improvements to it and you understand kind of the logistics behind how Google Tag Manager works, you can have it to where it fires an event when they reach a certain percentage of depth on the page, and you can kind of critically think to yourself, why is it that a reader is dropping off here, and what is it that I can do to kind of keep them around? And so one way to keep that reader on that piece of content longer would maybe to be embed some sort of widget or some sort of custom graphic or some sort of entertaining fact or something, or maybe even something as simple as just swishing paragraphs around so that readers are sticking around for your entire piece of content. And that way, they're not dropping off early. And I think that those sort of user behavior signals will tell Google, hey, this this reader, not only did this piece of content match intent well, but they scrolled all the way down to the bottom. They spent a lot of time on this page, and they clearly got the answers they were looking for because they didn't just click back to the search results and then go read another article. They either continued on somewhere else in their journey or they stopped searching altogether, which again, these are just basically signals telling Google that they got the information that they needed. And then one other thing that you can do that a lot of other bloggers, especially myself included, get kind of lazy about is each and every time, excuse me, you publish a new piece of content, take the time to actually go back and interlink from that piece to older articles, and then go into older articles that are relevant and interlink to that new piece of content. By linking to your new content, not only do you give them a little bit of an SEO boost, but you provide a better user experience in those old articles because you're providing additional context in the form of interlinking to a topically related piece of content. So definitely take the time to go back and to go into your articles and interlink to the content that you're publishing.

Ben Huber [00:49:18]:
And then my last thing I have for you guys, is just, again, to think critically about the user experience in in 2020, especially on the mobile side of things. Where Google switched to mobile first indexing in 2019, it shows how serious they are about providing a good user experience to mobile users. And that is highlighted none better than by just how many people are using their mobile devices in 2020. So as you can see, even 10 years ago, just when smartphones were released, almost none of the web traffic in the world was mobile. And by 2018, over 52% of it was. So people are spending over 3 hours a day on their phone. And if your site is not mobile friendly or mobile responsive or doesn't even look good on mobile, you're basically signaling to Google that you don't care about the majority of people on the internet. So again, my challenge for everyone here is just audit all of your new or cornerstone content from a mobile perspective for the next 30 days.

Ben Huber [00:50:21]:
So when you hit Publish on a piece of content or on a post and you think it looks great and then you switch over to mobile on your phone and you see that it looks terrible, you at least have enlightened yourself to what you're putting your readers or the majority of your readers through. And you need to take the time to go back and address why formatting or a picture or an image is blurry on mobile but it wasn't on desktop. I think that you will start to see that your session durations, your dwell times, your balance rates, all of that stuff will start to improve if you start thinking critically about how to provide a better mobile perspective. And once all of those user behavior signals get sent back to Google, I think that you're going to start to see better positions on for some of your more important queries. But anyways, that is all I got for you guys for this particular presentation. I hope you got something out of it. If you aren't sure about something or wanna follow-up or or just have a ton of questions because I basically threw a ton at you guys and you don't know how to quite implement it all, feel free to ask me or tag me a question in our blogging group. We have a blogging group on Facebook that addresses all of this stuff.

Ben Huber [00:51:32]:
It's called Breaking the 1 Percent Ultimate Blogging Group or BTP Ultimate Blogging Group. You can find me there. If you have any questions, just tag me. I'm happy to answer them. But anyways, you guys have a good one.

Liz Stapleton [00:51:42]:
Right. Then thank you so much for all that information. It's definitely giving me a lot to think about in terms of crafting my editorial calendar and going back and fixing some of my older content. So thank you. Any final words? I know we're gonna talk about your Facebook group too, but but any last words you wanna add.

Ben Huber [00:51:57]:
Sure. Yeah.

Ben Huber [00:51:58]:
I think it's I think it's one of those things where, you know, obviously, you can get overwhelmed with the number of changes that you just want to immediately go back and make to your website. And I think that, you know, if you learned anything today, I think just pick pick one of the topics and kind of tackle that first. I mean, a lot of times with SEO, there's site wide changes to make and that can feel super overwhelming. So just, you know, just tackle the site speed or just tackle the technical side of SEO. Get that knocked out and then move on to other things. If you're trying to revise a 100 or even 300 blog posts all at once for SEO, you're just gonna weigh yourself in. So focus on one thing and then kind of knock those out until you've kind of holistically addressed, you know, the search perspective of of bringing people to the system.

Ben Huber [00:52:40]:
Systematic approach

Liz Stapleton [00:52:40]:
to it, and don't try Right do everything all at once.

Ben Huber [00:52:42]:
Sure.

Liz Stapleton [00:52:43]:
Sure. Make sure you watch the system sessions of this as well.

Ben Huber [00:52:47]:
Yes. Absolutely.

Ben Huber [00:52:49]:
But I

Liz Stapleton [00:52:49]:
know so I know you have a Facebook group. You wanna tell us about that so that they can go go join it and whatnot?

Ben Huber [00:52:55]:
Yeah. Absolutely. So our Facebook group is the BTOP, Ultimate Blogging Group. You can just search for us on Facebook and it should pop up right away. I think the primary benefit there is that, you know, SEO is such a large journey. It's an ongoing journey, so you're probably gonna have questions all the time. We're we're always happy to answer them. So if there's something that I didn't talk about or there's something you wanna follow-up on or, like I said, there's, like, a technical component that you just can't wrap your head around, I'll be happy to answer it.

Ben Huber [00:53:20]:
Just all I have to do is create a thread, and we'll see if we we can knock it out for you.

Liz Stapleton [00:53:24]:
And as I'm looking to valuable resources, the link is below. They should definitely go check it out. I'm gonna go join. I don't think I'm in it right now, and I gotta fix that.

Ben Huber [00:53:31]:
So Yes. Absolutely.

Liz Stapleton [00:53:33]:
So thank you so much. And, everyone, you know, check out check out the Facebook group and and say hi to Ben and say thank you.

Ben Huber [00:53:39]:
Yes. Thank you. Thank you. Appreciate you having me on.

**Transcript:**
[00:00:13.430] - Benjamin Dell, Speaker
Hi there, Benjamin Dell here from Missinglettr. And thank you so much for taking the time to join us for this talk. At Missinglettr, we're obsessed with content distribution and in particular, how to get the most value out of each content that you publish. And so I'm particularly excited to share this talk with you today.

[00:00:33.870] - Speaker 1
Today we're going to be looking at what repurposing content is and why you should be doing it, some common mistakes and how to avoid them, a few different techniques to repurpose your content, and how to leverage influencers for your growing business.

[00:00:47.730] 
But first off, why repurposed content in the first place? Well, simply put, it's the smart thing to do.You've already spent the time and resources to develop the initial content, and so you might as well get the most use out of it as possible.

[00:01:00.930] 
Secondly, it helps more people see your content. Not everyone is interested in reading an article, listening to a podcast, or watching a video, and so ultimately, the more ways you can convert your existing content into new formats, the more likely you are to increase your audience size and in return, get more eyeballs on your product or service.

[00:01:20.130] 
And finally, repurposing content is a great way to conserve money. You've already spent the initial investment to create the original content, which makes it relatively affordable to repurpose it into new formats.

[00:01:32.310] - Speaker 1
So to kick things off, let's cover some of the common mistakes we often see. First up -  experimentation. Some of the most frequent mistakes people make when repurposing content is being afraid to try something new. An advantage of repurposing content is that it allows you to experiment with different mediums while already having the core of the content developed already. For example, if the original content was a podcast, try recreating it as an article or perhaps brief audio snippets for social media.

[00:02:01.830] - Speaker 1
Furthermore, these new forms of content allow you to increase your footprint on new social platforms that you might not already be on. But fundamentally, it's all about being comfortable experimenting with different formats. Now, while the process of repurposing content may seem intimidating at first, it's typically much easier than it sounds. One of the many roadblocks that are made during the beginning stages of repurposing content is trying to make everything perfect. It's better instead to get started and begin pushing out content than spending large amounts of time to try and create the ideal post or content.

[00:02:36.570] - Speaker 1
In fact, some of the best viral content out there is content that appears to be unpolished. I'm reminded of an advert that had a sofa or something like that in the background. A sofa had a clearly visible stain on it, and consequently, floods of comments started pouring through, noting the stain. Of course, everyone thought that they were being clever to have noticed it. Whether the stain was intentional or not, the unpolished authenticity of the content immediately grabbed people's attention. So don't get too hung up on overthinking the net outcome, if you will, and the quality of the piece of content.

[00:03:10.410] - Speaker 1
A great way to rid yourself of the problem of overthinking is to streamline the content creation process. So rather than creating and posting content as needed, maybe develop a few templates to reuse. Once you've created a few weeks of content, save time by scheduling them all at once. Now, like any other form of marketing, it's important to keep an eye on the results that you're seeing on social media.

[00:03:33.210] - Speaker 1
Try and make time as part of your workflow to check how your social posts have performed.

[00:03:38.070] - Speaker 1
The bottom line is that if you're experimenting with different formats and approaches, you'll almost certainly see different results in terms of engagement and clicks to start getting good at spotting positive signals and trends so that you know what to do more of in the future. And perhaps the most important, though, is don't be afraid to move on from strategies that aren't as effective.

[00:03:59.670] - Speaker 1
Now that we know what not to do, let's maybe turn our attention towards what a typical repurposing process might look like. So number one, we want to begin the repurposing process by browsing through your existing content and seeing which types of content resonate the strongest with your audience.

[00:04:16.590] - Speaker 1
This will allow you to identify what type of content your audience is looking for so that you can produce more of that in the future.

[00:04:23.610] - Speaker 1
Bear in mind that based on the type of content you create, some of these questions may not apply to you, so we might want to look at things like which podcasts have the most listens, which articles got the most clicks? Do you want to dig into Google Analytics or whatever that platform happens to be for the medium that you're using?

[00:04:40.830] 
Next, you might want to familiarize yourself with the content you've chosen to repurpose, and the reason for this is that typically you'll find that you'll start repurposing content that might be a few months or perhaps even a few years old.

[00:04:53.850] - Speaker 1
Sometimes it's from last week, but quite often it's old content, so it's always good practice to familiarize yourself with that subject matter once more, go over the content again, refresh your memory about what the topic was and what was discussed within. This then allows you to move on to the next step.

[00:05:11.070] - Speaker 1
Now that we are familiar with the content, we need to give some thought to the various ways it could be repurposed. Now, this can be the most challenging, but also the most fun part of the entire process. How you go about repurposing your content will, of course, be entirely dependent on the original format.

[00:05:27.390] 
While it might seem intimidating to try and experiment with a new form of content, don't let that stifle your creativity. At this stage, it's all about generating as many different types of ideas as possible, even the ones that don't seem like they might be, or even the ones that seem like they might be a long shot.

[00:05:42.510] - Speaker 1
Rather, once you've successfully brainstormed a list of potential ways to repurpose your content, start thinking about which ones are the most valuable. It's likely that you will have developed some ideas that make the most sense given your product or service and target audience, as well as the skills at your team's disposal. Take this time, sorry, to narrow down your list about the ideas you'd like to execute first. But be sure to save the entirety of the original list to reference at a later date. You're almost certainly going to need it.

[00:06:12.390] - Speaker 1
Just because something doesn't fit within your marketing plan at this time doesn't mean it can't in the future. You might want to use tools like Trello et cetera, and other sort of tracking tools like that to keep a log of the ideas so that you can refer back to them in the future.

[00:06:28.710] 
Five. Now it's time to act on the plan that you've created. Dependent on the forms of content chosen this will, of course, vary quite widely. Now, if budget is a concern or something is out of your wheelhouse, consider outsourcing specialist content to an expert freelancer. Platforms like At Work can be a really great way to find affordable talent, and we use them almost all the time.

[00:06:50.550] 
As with any other marketing initiative, it's vital to track KPIs and the performance of this repurposed content. Some frequently included analytics to keep an eye on are the number of likes, comments, shares, and, of course, website views. Keep in mind that it might take some trial and error to nail down a repurposing strategy that works for you and your audience.

[00:07:10.650] - Speaker 1
Okay, so before we wrap up, I'd like to briefly cover influencers and how they can be leveraged to distribute your content. It's often seen as one of those sorts of silver bullets, if you will, the Holy Grail of marketing is to tap into an influencer that suddenly will just open you up to a whole audience. The truth is somewhere in between, of course. And so it's worth just bearing in mind a few kinds of details here, but let's just, first of all, look at why it's good to tap into influencer marketing in the first place.

[00:07:44.370] - Speaker 1
We just need to look at Google. It's really grown in popularity over the last three years. In fact, the Google search term for influencer marketing has grown more than 1500% in the last three years. And rightfully so, influencer marketing can be an impactful marketing tool when properly implemented. In fact, in a recent industry survey, 80% of marketers said that their influencer marketing was an effective channel.

[00:08:08.370] 
However, influencer marketing, of course, isn't always the best fit for every business. So, as we said at the beginning, try an experiment to see whether it works for you. But certain products or services, such as physical consumer goods or software tools are, of course, more likely to have a natural fit with influencer marketing as they lean more likely towards that, they're easier products for influencers to talk about, promote and showcase across their channels.

[00:08:33.090] 
Typically speaking, utilizing social media influencers is ideal for growing a social media presence. Influencers will typically have a minimum of perhaps 1000 followers, but can easily grow into the millions these followers are ideal to tap into because they likely already trust the opinion of the influencer and the product recommendations they provide.

[00:08:52.650] - Speaker 1
With such an expansive and relevant audience, these followers are likely to be genuinely curious about your product and in return, check out your website, which should increase the number of sales made.

[00:09:04.110] - Speaker 1
Now, when choosing an influencer, we'll want to examine at least three key areas, and certainly, these are the things that we like to look at. Does the influencer fit within your niche? For example, if you have an accounting platform, it might make sense to partner with a small business. Naturally, these businesses need some form of accounting software, and it's likely that they will generally use your product. It's about finding authentic fits that don't look out of the ordinary or perhaps look like a hollow paid Advertisement.

[00:09:30.750] - Speaker 1
Number two. Numbers don't always tell the whole story. Now, unfortunately, as an influencer marketing has become so popular over the last few years, there's always been an uptick in influencers using sketchy tools, and they'll use things like bots to auto, follow their accounts, and just sort of inflate the number of followers that they have. And so, before beginning a partnership, use one of the many available tools to check the account for the percentage of real followers. You might also want to ask for verified Google Analytics data if they're suggesting a specific traffic volume that is.

[00:10:03.810] - Speaker 1
Number three. Popular social media platforms, particularly Instagram, reward users that have an active engagement rate. So when looking through their recent posts, you might want to take note of the number of likes and comments that the posts have received and always click on a few accounts to make sure that they are real accounts. As we saw before, bots are prevalent and can really get in the way of seeing what the true story is.

[00:10:25.230] 
So you found one or perhaps several influencers that you're interested in working with. Now it's time to get to work.

[00:10:31.170] 
Before beginning any work, though let's jump on a call to discuss any questions with the influencer to make sure that you have worked out what their recommended content strategy might look like. Typically, they will already know what their audience likes, and so it's really powerful and important to tap into that. And dependent on the influencer, it's likely that they might also have a menu of different services to choose from. And again, as a way of tapping into what they feel has worked well for others in the past. That might be a sort of useful corpus of information to tap into as well for advice. It also gives you a sense of some of the additional services that you might want to make use of in the future. Also, of course, take some time to review their work and services and then follow up to create a plan with them.

[00:11:17.850] 
Make sure that both parties are on the same page and that expectations have been clearly established. And, once the work is created by them, always be sure to see the content prior to publication. The last thing you want to do is to see inaccurate or false information about your product being conveyed to the public. Remember, it's your brand on the line.

[00:11:37.170]

**Transcript:**
[00:00:09.720] - Liz Stapleton, Summit Host
Today we're here, Bobby Warren, who's going to be dropping SEO knowledge, really kind of the basic stuff, especially you're just getting started. I know SEO can be super overwhelming. And the more you dig into it, the more you learn and the more you're like, ""I can't do all of it."" So, Bobby is here to help us out. Bobby, thank you so much for joining us. I really appreciate it.

[00:00:28.260] - Bobby Warren, woostermediagroup.com
Well, I am so grateful for the opportunity to join your Blogger Breakthrough Summit, because it wasn't very long ago that I was attending a blogging conference and got introduced to CEO and it led me out of a career as a journalist. And it was a blogging conference just like this, although it wasn't personal, not virtual. So it was a blogging conference similar to this that launched me on a career where I'm in my- I'm in my third year of business, but I've been doing SEO probably about five years. And in three years I am poised to triple my journalism income. So I hope the bloggers attending your Blogger Breakthrough don't underestimate what can happen with a conference like this.

[00:01:23.230] - Liz
Yes, I'm excited. I hope they get a lot out of it. I know they're going to learn a lot from you. I'm going to let you kind of take over, because I know you've got a presentation ready and I'll jump in with questions if I have them.

[00:01:34.420] - Bobby
Great. So, SEO stands for Search Engine Optimization. So since I started Wister Media Group, LLC CEO has been a core service of my business. As you know, SEO is very detailed and covers a broad spectrum of things. When I analyze a site. And for those bloggers out there, they do to make sure that they're using their header tags properly, the ones through H6. I generally never get lower than age three. Sometimes I go down to H4 pet or tags signal to Google that, hey, this piece is structured that each one is more important to signal intent of a page.

[00:02:21.400] - Liz
And the H1 is just the title. So, they shouldn't be marking any of their content that they're writing as H1; its just the title, correct?

[00:02:28.570] - Bobby
Yeah. H1 is kind of what's considered the main headline of your page, but it could be different than your meta title. So you have a page title and a meta title.

[00:02:43.630] - Liz
Okay.

[00:02:43.830] - Bobby
So, for example, we go to you go to my website. There might be a page one that says once you land on that page, the page title says, you know seven ways to use SEO strategies to boost your website or Google rankings. So that page title is like this big but. For SEO, you only want it that big, so your meter title, which a lot of people can change with your Yoast plug in, so you meta title might be shorter and your page title might be longer. The length of the- length of the page title doesn't matter, but the meta title does so little...

[00:03:29.030] - Liz
And I believe Yoast automatically will pull in whatever your header title is, but you can go on and edit that. So, when you go to the Yost settings on post, it should have a meta title section and that's where you can change that just for anyone who really doesn't know.

[00:03:29.030] - Bobby
Yeah, yeah. And and interestingly enough, I don't use Yoast, but it's like the number one plugin, but I don't I don't use it. So with SEO, you learning about your header tags, your meta title tags, meta descriptions of text, canonical links. So, there's just so much there's so much involved with site maps, Google Analytics, Google search console. And I know there are other search engines out there like Bing and Yahoo! But for the most part in the United States, you're looking at Google. They have like over 90% of the search market. So, SEO incorporates so many different things. You can't be an expert at everything. And I try not to. And what- where I've really been kind of focusing in on is really content and content optimization.

[00:04:44.130] - Liz
Okay.

[00:04:44.660] - Bobby
But I do a lot of other things. So what I want to do is kind of go through the what I call the ABC of SEO for beginning bloggers.

[00:04:54.820] - Liz
All right.

[00:04:55.550] - Bobby
So for my A, it's allocate resources for SEO immediately. Now, I was at a conference and it covered a lot of different topics. And one of the presenters who was very successful in her field, she had a popular blog, you know, in our industry, and she sat there and told people in the conference that we're at her presentation. If you don't have a lot of content on your site, don't invest in SEO. And it kind of made me cringe a little bit. Because SEO is all about getting your site to rank higher, it's removing any barriers, it's following best practices. And afterward I had a- I spoke with her in the hall and I was going to raise my hand in the middle of her presentation. And I said, ""Look, I understand what you're saying. And, you know, if you have a small site, you know, you might not want to pay someone like me to do SEO work. But resources doesn't have to be your money. It could be your time and your talent. So go do a Google search, like what's the fundamentals of SEO? What is what do I need to know? So those resources can be your top. Like I said, your time and your talent.

[00:06:24.660] - Liz
Or your spouse's time in your wife's case.

[00:06:27.120] - Bobby
Amen. Yes, my wife, in fact. While we're speaking, she's doing research for a blog post for me.

[00:06:40.860] - Liz
I heard about it.

[00:06:41.520] - Bobby
So SEO is about helping people find you online, because if you have something they need, how are they going to find you? So, I don't care how big or how small your website is, SEO strategies can help. And so then when you do your Google search, Google is the number one search engine. And right behind that at number two is YouTube. Right? So, YouTube's almost becoming like a university because you can find out how to do anything. But when you find those pages, when you find those videos, it's because somebody is doing SEO, you really need to do it as well. And like I said, it doesn't have to be money. It could be you learning about it. And one of the things I want to do is, you know, offer your attendees something that will help them if they need you. So, we will have something free for them so that-

[00:07:41.410] - Liz
We'll have a link to follow this presentation that will steer them in the right direction.

[00:07:46.570] - Bobby
Right? So- so this person said, SEO, don't invest in. Well, one of my clients now, he wasn't a blogger, but he had revenue and millions of dollars a year. Right. And I looked at his website, I did an audit of this website, and it took 50 seconds for his page to load his home page- 50 seconds.

[00:08:14.200] - Liz
And Ideally you want 1 to 2, correct?

[00:08:15.970] - Bobby
Yes.

[00:08:16.210] - Liz
We [inaudible] talking tech and I think some SEO issues, but it makes it SEO too.

[00:08:21.850] - Bobby
Right. So, you really want it under three, two seconds is really good. But, you know. His page load speed, a web design issue, is that a development issue? Well, nobody took care of that at that level. So is the SEO guy who had to figure it out. Right? So- so if you you know, if you have a blog and it takes 10, 15 seconds for it to load, nobody's waiting around for that. They're going to hit the back button. And what's the- what's the next thing that I can go? Yeah. So, SEO is- is important as well.

[00:08:56.530] - Liz
I think they can go to it like Kingdome.com or whatever to check the load speed of their site.

[00:08:56.530] - Bobby
I use Web page, web page test and I believe it's dot com.

[00:09:09.500] - Liz
Okay.

[00:09:09.890] - Bobby
Thanks to Autofill I just put Web P...

[00:09:12.530] - Liz
And you can do a Google search for like website speed tests or something and it'll- it'll steer in the right direction. So you have some idea of how long it takes for your site.

[00:09:25.070] - Bobby
Yeah. And talking about like, well, I don't have a lot of content on my site. I just did a web video on it for. A business owner who is launching a site geared towards freelancers and while the site was in maintenance mode, I could not crawl it to do an audit. So, the second it went live, I did the audit and they were problems with the meta descriptions. There were duplicate H1 tags and you don't want to duplicate page titles. It just makes it confusing as search engines try to index your page and figure out what is this page about. So, the site went live and the second it went live, there are issues that just weren't caught in the Web development stage. Web developers are not SEO consultants. They might know SEO, but they are not consultants. It's not know if you find a web developer who's great at SEO. Or her.

[00:10:34.290] - Bobby
Hold on to them I should say.

[00:10:34.450] - Liz
Yeah.

[00:10:36.270] - Bobby
There you go, right. So I know SEO, but I don't know web development. I can build a website and I do, but I'm not a Web designer and I'm not a web developer. I just know how to use the tools.

[00:10:49.450] - Liz
Yeah.

[00:10:49.910] - Bobby
So and so would you allocate resources, whether it's a consultant or whether it's yourself? These kinds of things show up and you can address them so that you give your website every opportunity to succeed in the search rankings, which we call SERP's Search Engine Result Pages. But at the end of the day, SEO is about, you know creating content that best matches the searchers content or users. So Google wants to best match the searchers content with a page intent. And the better you identify that content to Google, the better your page will rank. So that's A.

[00:11:35.630] - Bobby
B is be careful with back links. Back links is an area that I have not done well with. When I say that, I just don't focus on it. And I'll tell you why. When we get to C, which is control what you can control.

[00:11:54.470] - Liz
Okay.

[00:11:54.830] - Bobby
But. Be careful with back links. Back links are important because- and what they are is when somebody with a website is linking to content on your site. They're telling their readers their site visitors, hey, this is really good information that will help you. So, when you get a back link, that's a signal to Google that, ""Hey, this person knows what they're writing about. This is good information, good content."" And so you're going to get kind of bonus points, so to speak, if you're going to rank a little bit higher.

[00:12:36.330] - Liz
[Inaudible]

[00:12:36.630] - Bobby
Yes. Your authority. Because back links show that you have some expertise, you have some authority, and that you have trustworthy content, what what we call EAT expertise, trustworthiness or authority. Although I got the letters messed up. I got them all, which is the wrong order. So. So you want back links?

[00:13:04.710] - Liz
But getting back high quality backlands is not very easy. But here's where I say be careful with back links, do not pay for a back link or back links. A friend of mine was starting a website and he says, ""Hey, Bobby, I found on Twitter that I can get..."" not on Twitter. ""I found on Fiverr that I can get, like, three hundred back links.""

[00:13:34.630] - Bobby
,Right and anyone that's pitching you that is spammy and it's not going to help you. Google doesn't like paid back links. They get mad at you.

[00:13:41.650] - Liz
Yeah. They get mad at you that you'll get penalized and you're going to drop in the rankings. Yeah. So do not pay for back links. However, there's kind of a side door to get into paying for back legs, which is not terrible, and a lot of companies do it, and that is with sponsored content.

[00:14:06.920] - Liz
Yeah.

[00:14:07.650] - Bobby
So- so one of my clients is a personal finance blogger and a company with a browser extension that helps you when you shop paid him for sponsored content.

[00:14:24.490] - Liz
Yes.

[00:14:25.020] - Bobby
So I ended up writing that content. And here's the interesting thing- I had no clue it was a sponsored content. I thought he just wanted me to write about this. I happened to use that browser extension. I love it. So when I wrote about it, I honestly wrote a glowing review because I love it and I use it almost every day. But that content was paid for and there were links going back to the browser extension. So consequently, that is a paid back link. But it's not what you mentioned earlier. I'm going to pay a fee and I'm going to get hundreds of back links.

[00:15:06.660] - Liz
It needs to be disclosed too and our legal sessions will touch on that. Right. But if you are doing sponsored content, make sure you're disclosing that that's a regulation. But also it helps Google inform kind of what's happening to.

[00:15:20.940] - Bobby
Right. Thank you very much. And I appreciate the legal products that you offer because I use them on my website. So, thank you very much. You know, as we're sitting here talking, I forget about your legal background because I'm just talking to SEOs. So we're you know-

[00:15:36.930] - Liz
I just I [inaudible] sponsored content because people sometimes forget or don't realize that a free product counts to other its actual payment or product. Yeah.

[00:15:45.810] - Bobby
Yeah. And so you can you can also write a guest post on somebodies blog, but it's probably not as popular as it once was. And it's different than what is a private blog network where you have these network of bloggers and they all share each other's links. That's not helpful either. So, you want to avoid paid links, you want to avoid those private blog networks. But guess posting is okay. Sponsored content. There's a service called Help a Reporter Out, which we call Hero. I call Night Cloud. And every day journalists are looking for sources. So, you can go to the website. You can see who needs an expert source or whatever your specialty is. If you're a personal finance blogger. If you're into parenting, health, wellness, whatever, you know, you can go to Help a Reporter Out and be a source and kind of get back links. That way you can look for podcasters who are in your industry and try to get on there and you'll get a back link and or.

[00:17:02.780] - Bobby
You know where I've been successful for client and says being part of Facebook groups of content creators and they say, hey, I need I need a certified financial planner who can talk to me about, you know, a Roth to Roth IRA conversion.

[00:17:21.440] - Liz
Yeah. Or they're just like ""I'm doing a round up post. Who has a story on this, you know.""

[00:17:26.230] - Bobby
Yeah.

[00:17:26.750] - Liz
Yeah.

[00:17:27.680] - Bobby
Yeah. So those so be careful with back links. They're difficult but not impossible.

[00:17:33.450] - Liz
Yes.

[00:17:33.980] - Bobby
And so my I C I kind of said was control what you can control. And so as an SEO consultant, I don't worry about back links maybe as much as I should, because I can't control whether somebody will give me a back links, but what I can't control is the content that I create. And so all your bloggers can control the content they create. So, I don't get caught up in this SEO rollercoaster- every time, you know- Google makes three to four changes a day, if not more, to their algorithm. Every once in a while you'll see something. They'll be like, ""Oh, Google just released a major update of its algorithm.""

[00:18:24.570] - Liz
Yeah.

[00:18:25.920] - Bobby
I do not get caught up in that because I focus on the content on the page, making sure it's the best that it can be. So, there's a guy I follow on Twitter, Bill Shalosky owns this company is SEO by the Sea and. Every once in a while film, he'll put out this blog post from Google back in 2011.

[00:18:57.430] - Liz
Okay.

[00:18:57.990] - Bobby
And what Google was after and said, you know, a lot of peoples- ask us, ""What can we do to improve our rankings?"" Basically, the advice is create quality content that will help.

[00:19:18.640] - Liz
Yeah.

[00:19:19.110] - Bobby
So, it has a series of questions. Would you trust this advice? Would you recommend this to a friend? Does it answer your questions as a quality content? So write good, relevant, informative blog posts that kind of answers a person's question.

[00:19:39.360] - Liz
Solve the problem?

[00:19:40.930] - Bobby
Exactly, yeah. If you cannot solve a problem, you don't have a business.

[00:19:46.470] - Liz
Yeah, yeah, exactly. IT all goes back top user intent. And that's whether you're doing optimization for Google or YouTube or Pinterest you know, if you want to kind of be clicked on- we have sessions on this too you- want it to be something that answers a problem and provides a solution.

[00:20:01.590] - Bobby
Right.

[00:20:01.940] - Liz
It's really it's a... It's user intent. And it's focusing on that and making sure you're providing results for them.

[00:20:08.880] - Bobby
Right. So in the link where we offer something to your attendees, we're going to have information on how to write and how to structure a blog post to help your rank higher because you need to like we talked about earlier, you need proper header tags, meta titles. You need good, catchy headlines that will bring people in. You need relative informative content, you know, are you targeting the right keywords? And so are you revisiting your content and updating it because there's something Google calls YM-YL Your Money - Your Life. And think about the position Google is in, you know, let's say God forbid somebody in your family has cancer and all our lives have been touched by someone with cancer. You know, I don't care if essential oils work or not, but does Google want to send somebody who's dealing with cancer to a site that says take essential oils. And I'm not being disparaging against holistic health and things like that, but you might need a little bit more medical intervention than essential oils.

[00:21:31.940] - Liz
Yeah.

[00:21:32.710] - Bobby
So- so make sure you're providing good, relevant content and control what you can control, and I've been able to help small websites rank, and when you rank and Google, you're in the top one hundred pages. So, a small website. Without a lot of domain authority, page authority was ranking because we controlled the content, a lot of things we can't control, but we control the content. So, we really spend time writing great content.

[00:21:31.940] - Liz
Yeah.

[00:22:11.690] - Bobby
It's as easy as that. And it was difficult as that.

[00:22:15.920] - Liz
So, easier said than done.

[00:22:18.680] - Bobby
Right. And D is distribute your content consistently. You cannot create a blog post, put it on Twitter or Facebook, Pinterest, LinkedIn or whatever else and say, ""Okay, I wrote the post, I sent the link out. Yeah, that's it."" It's like. After you create good content, I mean, your work has just begun.

[00:22:48.230] - Liz
Yes.

[00:22:48.760] - Bobby
So, what you can do with that blog post is you can create graphics and just highlight a quote and post that out with a link back to your site, you can create a thread on Twitter. And kind of take that blog post and make it almost like a micro blog post on your Twitter feed, you know, just by doing a thread, so you post the next thing in the content, you can take that content to a Facebook live. One of the guys I'm following on Twitter, he's starting to do a LinkedIn live. That's something that I've not explored. But I get alerts that says, Eric is LinkedIn live like, okay, I've never jumped in, but I get alerts for it. So. There's just a way you have to continue to recycle, repurpose that content and, you know, there are services out there that will now will take your blog post, missing letter, and it will create like a drip campaign, a social media drip campaign. It'll take that blog post and allow you to drip it out over the next year, like I think nine times over a year.

[00:24:13.040] - Liz
Yeah. And you can and I have a missing letter and yeah, you can you can kind of create your own custom campaign if you want to be heavier in the first few months or...

[00:24:22.220] - Bobby
Right. Yeah. And that missing letter help generate a lot of traffic to my wife's blog. So, stuff like that helps. But you have to continue to distribute that content, you know. You know, if- if anyone in here was in sales, you know, ABC is always be closing.

[00:24:45.360] - Liz
Yeah.

[00:24:45.780] - Bobby
Well, ABC always be content distributed.

[00:24:13.040] - Liz
There we go.

[00:24:53.070] - Bobby
So, finally, we're going to wrap up with E is evaluate your results and kind of the way you can do that is make sure you have Google Analytics installed properly on your website. Make sure you signed up for Google search console. And they have- they have your website indexed. So, if you're not indexed, people are not going to find you. So- so with Google Analytics, you can go in. And track how many people are coming to your website? How long are they staying there? Are they are they visiting more than one page? You know, that's called a bounce rate. Are they coming in and bouncing back out after one page or are they going somewhere else? So, Google Analytics will let you know what pages they're landing on. Now, for people who are in e-commerce, what have you, a landing page to someone in e-commerce is different than a landing page in Google Analytics. So, in e-commerce, a landing page is where you try to convert someone into a customer or to sign up for your email newsletter, sign up for a free product and get on the, you know, the mailing list. And what have you. But in Google Analytics, a landing page is just where did you enter the site and what page did you land?. And so then it will tell you your exit pages. Where are they leaving?

[00:26:33.290] - Liz
Yes.

[00:26:33.450] - Bobby
So, if you have. Like, I know for- I deal with some local companies and we have a contact us page, so if you finish that contact us page, we send you to a thank you page and say, ""Hey, we're going to be in touch with you. Thanks for reaching out."" So, if you get one hundred people landing on the contact us page at only five, getting to the thank you page, then they're not kind of reaching out and they're not getting an answer they might need. And Google search console that will tell you what pages how- how do people find you, which they call query search queries. So, how are people finding, you know, where you know, what pages are you ranking for?

[00:27:24.930] - Bobby
So, the joke is, if you want to bury a body, it on Google second page because nobody will find it. So, you want to make sure you're on the first page. You want to make sure you're in the top three. The click through rate after three after the third position on the first page just falls dramatically. So- so you really want to be in the top three. So, when you look at the Google search console, if you find that you're ranking like in the teens in the 20s, that's opportunity where you can optimize your content, you know control what you can control.

[00:28:07.740] - Liz
Yeah.

[00:28:08.520] - Bobby
And evaluate it. Do a- if you're trying to rank for Roth IRA conversion. Can you tell I worked with wealth management firm?

[00:28:19.310] - Liz
With personal finance space.

[00:28:20.420] - Bobby
So, if you try to rank for Roth IRA conversions, do a Google search, see who- see who is on the first page, look at what kind of head- headers. When I talk about headers, what kind of sections are on there? What is a Roth IRA? What are the tax advantages of a Roth IRA? What are you what are the pros and the cons? And see see what content you might be lacking and how can you improve it. So, evaluate your results. See if people are finding you, see if people- what kind of behavior they have on your site through Google Analytics and also social engagement isn't everything. But if you're going to be on social media, be social.

[00:29:15.260] - Liz
Definitely something I struggle with myself.

[00:29:17.300] - Bobby
Yeah. Yeah. So, because I do social media management for some companies, I have Twitter and Facebook open all the time, LinkedIn to a lesser degree. And so I find myself on it a lot. But, you know, there are people who are out there trying to sell, you know, they have trying to sell their course. They're trying to sell their eBook or whatever. And so what they do is they ask questions on Twitter or Facebook or whatever to- to engage with others. And then you respond and then they don't respond back. And it's like, okay, this is social media. But you can look at social media, see what kind of engagement you're getting and they'll let you know what you're doing. So, is there anything else? Like I said, we're going to have some we're going to have some type of content available for your bloggers so that, you know, if they did take notes, that's okay. Well, we'll break it down into something easy, easy to digest so that they can start growing their business from where it was and. Again, I appreciate the opportunity. I hope I did okay job.

[00:30:44.690] - Liz
Yeah, no, I think this information was great. Hopefully people aren't feeling overwhelmed. I feel like you broke it down and it is sort of easy to approach way. Definitely go check out that freebie Bobby's offering in his website information that is below or down to left or it's on the page, I promise.

[00:31:05.900] - Bobby
Somewhere.

[00:31:06.230] - Liz
But Bobby, again, thank you so much. And he answered questions in the chat. If you have more questions, feel free to ask. And I know he'll kindly answer for you.

[00:31:17.870] - Bobby

**Transcript:**
[00:00:13.430] - Speaker 1
Hi there. My name is Chris Lema. And for the next 20, maybe 30 minutes, I'd like to talk to you about what it's like, what it would be like for you to turn yourself into a content-generating machine. Everybody looks at that blank screen and feels the same pressure, feels the same stress by the time we're done, my hope for you is that you will have figured out through some of the frameworks I'm about to present how to get past that stress of I'm staring at a blank screen.

[00:00:50.950] - Speaker 1
I don't know what to write.

[00:00:51.730] - Speaker 1
I don't know if what I'm going to write is good enough or even staring at the screen where you've already finished writing something and you don't want to hit the publish button and you have that anxiety. Is anyone going to want this? Is anyone going to read this is anyone to share this?. We're going to try and get past all of that. And the good news is I can use all of my time because there is nothing fancy at the end.

[00:01:12.920] - Speaker 1
There is no pitch. There is nothing for me to sell you. The only thing you need is the frameworks I'm going to present to you in this presentation. So with that, let's get started. And the best way to get started is not to talk about how to become a content-generating machine.

[00:01:28.670] - Speaker 1
It's how to make sure that you don't kill yourself in the process, right? How to make sure that you are not making the most common mistakes that everybody seems to make. So let's hit those real quicks.

[00:01:44.430] 
The first is if you can only produce content when you're feeling something like when you're feeling motivated, we're going to have a problem, right? You're never going to turn yourself into a content-generating machine if you need that motivated, super excited, feeling. Athletes, exercise, and work out even if they don't feel like it.

[00:02:09.280] - Speaker 1
There are people I have friends that go running every day and they run even if it's raining outside. For me. If it's even cloudy and it looks like it might rain, I'll just stay inside. Motivation cannot be a part of the drive and the habit and the dynamic of producing content. So you got to get past that.

[00:02:26.940] 
The other one you got to get past is the I want to be super popular.

[00:02:30.290] - Speaker 1
I want to produce viral content. The results are not what you control. You control the process, you control the habit. You control the ability to get content published. What happens with that content is not up to you.

[00:02:45.880] - Speaker 1
And so you can't carry the weight of that. It has to be super popular. You can't carry that weight in terms of being motivated to publish your content. The other one is I know people who are like, I'm going to write the one and only Magnum opus. I'm going to write the critical final word on whatever the topic is and that's not what you want to do.

[00:03:11.900] - Speaker 1
You're not looking to create the complete The Ultimate. You've seen those titles all over the Internet, right. The ultimate guide to. First of all, let's be honest. Have you read any of those?

[00:03:22.660] - Speaker 1
Because most of us don't have time for the ultimate. We have enough time for, hey, here's a couple of quick hits, right. So we don't want to get stuck making that mistake, and we don't want to have to produce perfectly timeless content, right. If you're sitting in the world where you think, no, I'm going to put something in here and that's going to make it dated. It's.

[00:03:45.130] - Speaker 1
Okay. People are going to know that you didn't just write this yesterday and again today and again tomorrow. It was crafted in a moment in time. So let's not worry about Evergreen content forever. All right.

[00:03:58.300] - Speaker 1
We're just going to worry about what does it look like for us to consistently press, publish? And lastly, by now, you could have figured this one out, right? It's not about perfection. What we need to develop is the muscles and the habits and the approach to produce consistent content. Consistency does all the work for you.

[00:04:22.200] - Speaker 1
But you can't do that if you're going to make these mistakes, right? And so you don't want to get caught in them.

[00:04:30.910] - Speaker 1
That's what not to do. Right. And it's good because I'm positive that we could have spent all 30 minutes just talking about the no-nos, right? Because you've done it. I've done it.

[00:04:42.380] - Speaker 1
We've all done it. And it's easy to get caught in that trap. But we don't want to live there. Right. And so if we're going to talk about the consistent, continuous development of content, then there's really only one place to go.

[00:04:59.410] - Speaker 1
And I know you're going to be like, wait, what? And the answer is we got to go to Tyler Perry. So some of you may go, I don't know who Tyler Perry is. Who's Tyler Perry, right? He's the guy who did everything differently.

[00:05:12.110] - Speaker 1
And I mean, seriously differently. 1200 TV episodes, 24 plays, touring across the country, 22 films, ten TV shows, one book, and recently purchased a 330-acre studio. Atlanta, which is becoming kind of the second Hollywood in the US, is where he set himself up and has now a large enough studio to do anything, record anything and even help others come and record. But there are some things that Tyler Perry does that most people don't do. So you may not know this, but movies are expensive to make.

[00:05:54.000] - Speaker 1
And yet Tyler Perry, like 100 million, 200 million. Tyler Perry's movies cost about 20 million to produce. That's not a lot of money to produce a movie, and they regularly gross more than 50 million. Right. So he's not looking for 500 million.

[00:06:13.730] - Speaker 1
He's not looking to do kind of Marvel Universe, break the bank records. He's just like, let's just hit a good double hit another double, hit another double 50 million at the box office, another 5 million in DVDs and streaming video. And you go, would you invest 20 to get 55? Yeah. Every day.

[00:06:35.180] - Speaker 1
And so when you look at how many different movies you've done, right, you go. Okay. That's successful. But it's not just about the fact that he's wise with how he makes his investment. What's more important is that the average amount of time that it takes someone to produce or to write a screenplay is months and months and often multiple rewrites, and sometimes script doctors.

[00:07:01.090] - Speaker 1
They have to come in and redo it again after the rewrite. And his takes three weeks and has almost no rewrites, they literally produce any one of these 22 films with a three-week writing process, and then they're done. And if you thought, oh, well, that's because his movies are a certain style of no, no. Let's talk about his TV episodes, right? Most Hollywood Studios record one episode a week.

[00:07:28.810] - Speaker 1
He records three to four a week. Now. Part of that is because he has the process, the flow. He knows what he's doing. And I'm going to walk you through those frameworks for him.

[00:07:40.480] - Speaker 1
But the other part of it is he knows this is all a game of bats. So it's all about produce, produce, produce, publish, publish, published. That's the name of the game. So let's break down what he's doing, right. The first is he starts narrow with a very specific audience and grows from there.

[00:08:00.730] - Speaker 1
Sometimes we want to write the kind of perfect content that goes for everyone. And that's not helpful. It's also not a path towards success. So what you want to do if you're living in the Tyler Perry world is you want to start with a very narrow niche. For him, it was black Church, women, African Americans, not everybody else women, not everybody else, and people who have a Church background and not everybody else.

[00:08:28.020] - Speaker 1
That's fairly narrow. And this is why people were like, hey, he did all these plays. But then now that he has a movie, he doesn't have to do plays anymore. You're like, no. He kept doing the plays because it allowed him to stretch his audience to see how he could move from one audience to the next and see if the material works.

[00:08:47.030] - Speaker 1
We're going to talk about the feedback loops in a minute. But if you look at this chart, what you see is it starts with one group and then extends to all black families and eventually to non-black audiences. It is a consistent set of tweaking and adjusting and testing. When he took his little play troupe from the south up to the north, and now they're going to do the play there. In interviews, he said how he adjusts some of the words and test some of the languages to see.

[00:09:13.670] - Speaker 1
Okay. Would this fit better? Right. So you start with a narrow audience and then you grow it from there what's the second thing he does, right? Well, as I mentioned, he produces more content faster than everybody else, whether it's the three-week approach to writing his scripts or whether it's recording three or four episodes while others are recording only one, he knows he has to get stuff out.

[00:09:42.960] - Speaker 1
And he's again said in interviews, if I had to wait for perfection, if I had to wait until I felt like this is perfect, I wouldn't produce a thing yet. Most of us, as I mentioned earlier, we get caught in that whole thing of like, oh, this isn't right. This isn't great. Someone's going to have a problem with this one sentence, and then we hold back. It's how the pair doesn't do that just keeps producing, keeps getting at-bats.

[00:10:09.790] - Speaker 1
And then lastly, what Tyler Perry does is focus on feedback loops and feedback loops are the things you wouldn't have predicted for him. He had these plays and they were small, like, 4500 people, Max. And the way he would do the play was really ingenious. He would put 20 people in a chorus and put them in the play. Now, the whole benefit of putting 20 people in the chorus is that each one of those 20 then goes and invites family and friends to the show, come see me on my part.

[00:10:41.820] - Speaker 1
And so he got bigger audiences simply because of the way he crafted the narrative and the drama. But the point is he has these plays and he's testing material and he's understanding audience feedback. He's testing jokes. You can't do that in a movie, right? When you publish the movie, you produce it, you write it, you publish it and it goes out the door.

[00:11:02.960] - Speaker 1
You can go watch a screening. But there's no feedback loop in that. You're just literally going to see how it works. But in a play, it's live with an audience. And the more that you put yourself out there.

[00:11:14.330] - Speaker 1
And the more you collect that feedback, the more you can tweak it. And so the stuff that he learns and plays affects his movies. And then, of course, you get the feedback from the movies in terms of reviews that may affect his plays. And those feedback loops change the name of the game.

[00:11:32.210] - Speaker 1
There's nobody better at doing what I'm describing for you than Tyler Perry. It's why I use him as an example. And what I want to do is talk a little about the kind of in the same way we talked about mistakes. I want to talk a little for just a few minutes on then what do we do? We're not all Tyler Perry.

[00:11:49.310] - Speaker 1
We get that. But what does it mean for us? Right? And the first is you have to start developing a writing habit, a habit that is like, hey, I write every night after dinner or I write every day before dinner, or I write every day after I go for my morning run. People who have never run before, and want to start running.

[00:12:12.420] - Speaker 1
Most of the coaches that will get non-runners to become runners will talk about the habit of running. Put your shoes over by the door. When you get up. You normally have a coffee, right? Don't have the coffee until you go and take your run.

[00:12:27.630] - Speaker 1
Right. And so all of a sudden you start connecting chaining these habits. And it's easier to develop one new habit if it's connected to another habit that already exists. And so the same thing is true for you with writing, right? What you want to do is develop the habit of writing.

[00:12:44.870] - Speaker 1
The other thing is, I've said it before you got to take more at-bats. You just got to write more. You got to publish more. And the more you publish, the better you'll get at it, the more nuanced you'll become, the better you'll be able to take that feedback and adjust it into your new writing. But it won't work if you're writing one post a year or one post a quarter, even one post a month, you're going to have to get more and bats.

[00:13:12.110] - Speaker 1
The other is you got to get comfy with imperfect content, right? You got to get okay with content that is in your head. Maybe a B. You have no idea if the reader doesn't read it and go, oh, my God, there's an A-plus material. You can't judge someone else.

[00:13:31.550] - Speaker 1
You don't know how they're going to respond, but you can totally judge yourself. We've all lived there. And so what ends up happening is we go out if it's not perfect and I'm not publishing, you have to get comfortable pushing to publish, even when you know the content is not perfect, right? And you have to build your own feedback loops, right? You have to get to a place where you know how to test your own material.

[00:13:55.190] - Speaker 1
I normally talk about this in the same way that comedians test theirs. We watch comedians when they get on Netflix or they get on HBO or somewhere and you watch them and they do 45 minutes or they do an hour and a half of straight material and you're laughing the whole time. But that's not how the material was developed. They had to take each one of those jokes and each setup and they had to put it in front of people and suck. It was imperfect content, and they got comfortable with it.

[00:14:22.590] - Speaker 1
And then they started Pruning and Tweaking, and then they use that feedback loop to take certain jokes longer to cut other ones shorter. And then they start crafting their stuff. And the same thing happens for you and you're going to go, wait, wait. How? Well, it won't always be by writing a blog post, and we'll get to that in a second.

[00:14:40.820] - Speaker 1
But you have to create your own feedback loops. You have to let the audience inform content and then content inform the audience and go back and forth. All right. And maybe the biggest deal here is you have to get comfortable with disposable ideas, right? You have to get comfortable with the fact that just because you had a thought doesn't make it your best thought just because you had a thought doesn't make it a perfect thought.

[00:15:05.880] - Speaker 1
Just because you had a thought doesn't even make it the right thought. And most of us are like, wait, what are you talking about again, to comedians they know, oh, I have this set up for a joke, and by the time you end up hearing it, it's maybe 180 degrees different. Like, it's all morphed because you're not tied to the first iteration of the idea. I know when I start writing, sometimes I write something, and then I'm like, halfway through, I realized, no, this isn't going right.

[00:15:32.530] - Speaker 1
And I start tweaking it.

[00:15:33.540] - Speaker 1
And by the time I'm done, I'm like, wow, I literally just developed a completely different hypothesis than the one I thought I was writing about. So I know I've spent a whole lot of time 15 minutes talking to you, and I haven't shown you the framework. So the whole promise was to show you some frameworks to help you write faster. And the first thing I want to do is I want to talk about this disposable idea piece. Okay.

[00:15:56.220] - Speaker 1
So what's the point of today? I want to give you some frameworks to help you become a content-generating machine. And that's what we're going to look at. So let's look at the first one. It's all about feedback loops.

[00:16:10.920] - Speaker 1
And the way that I create a lot of material is that I start with a tweet. I start with just writing a sentence, two sentences, and I put it on Twitter, and I allow my audience to either say, but you forgot this. You missed this. What about this or yes. Plus plus, like like, heart heart retweet retweet.

[00:16:30.470] - Speaker 1
And it tells me, OOH, people are grooving with this. They like this. But also someone may say, Well, you forgot about this, and then I write them back in a tweet, and then they write back. And so we sit here in this loop of just tweet after tweet. Now I have some friends that I go hang out with on Thursdays, and I bring whatever has been interesting to those conversations.

[00:16:52.850] - Speaker 1
And so tweets turn into conversations or chats. And what's happening is as we're talking, it's reforming my ideas, which means I may go back and tweet again, like, hey, you never thought about it. This is my take, right? This is my new take, which may create a whole bunch more tweets and may drive to another conversation. Eventually, I'm going to take that material.

[00:17:14.240] - Speaker 1
I'm going to write a blog post. You know what happens the moment I write a blog post about it. People are going to want to talk about it, and people are going to want to tweet about it and they're going to go back and forth while you missed this. Or what about this? Or this is a great post.

[00:17:24.220] - Speaker 1
And so the whole time, these feedback loops are being generated in multiple different channels on Twitter, in person, and on a website. But then if I get enough feedback, I may bring this concept or idea into a talk where I'm on stage and performing. And when I do that, people are going to want to circle back and wait afterward and they're going to want to chat. And other people are going to tweet about the actual talk and this quote or whatever. And some people are going to write posts and review the talk that they were at the conference for and all of a sudden.

[00:17:57.410] - Speaker 1
Now my feedback loops get bigger. And then I take a concept that now I've refined further and I bring it into my coaching practice where I coach entrepreneurs and as we're coaching, they put it into practice, and we start figuring out ways to tweak things. And that means that I can finally turn it into a framework, and I bring that framework back to coaching customers. Sometimes I bring it into talks and I'll definitely write about them. And then those frameworks over time, as they get refined, become part of my overall worldview.

[00:18:28.510] - Speaker 1
By the time the idea gets to here, you better believe I strongly believe it. But when I started by writing it over here, it was loosely held right. I didn't want to hold on to it and say, this is my definitive answer. We have to get really comfortable with disposable ideas with the notion that I may change my mind. I may learn, I may grow these are good things, but all this part of this process also allows me to keep generating content so that's the first model, right.

[00:19:00.780] - Speaker 1
And it's a model of feedback loops that helps us turn out or create content. The other thing I want to tell you about is that most of us spend all of our time only writing content in the middle of the life cycle model of a reader. We presume that the reader knows a whole lot and knows our vocabulary and knows how to describe things. And we start from there. Yet you and I both have lived in a world often where we don't even know what to Google, right?

[00:19:31.920] - Speaker 1
Ever gone to Google? And you're like, I want to ask a question, but I have no idea what to write here. I don't know what the words are. It's because we don't know even the problem vocabulary. My wife and I had our kids who are now in high school.

[00:19:47.730] - Speaker 1
Our kids were little, and that meant that on our TV constantly, all there was children's television. And we said, let's go out on a date tonight and we got a babysitter. And then my wife said, I want to go watch a movie, right. But not one of those kid movies. And I said, sure, go pick it.

[00:20:02.780] - Speaker 1
So she goes on Google and she types new adult movies. Yeah. No, that's not going to show what you think it's going to show, right? Because in her head, she didn't connect that. Oh, that phrase means something.

[00:20:17.870] - Speaker 1
She was using solution vocabulary, but not for the solution she wanted. Right. And we have this problem where we don't know what to search for. And it turns out our customers don't know what to search for because they don't know how to describe their problem, much less describe a solution. And so the first thing I'll tell you is to stop writing content that starts when you think about your entire editorial calendar.

[00:20:42.300] - Speaker 1
Stop writing where it starts where people are solution aware. Start writing where they're completely unaware. Write the content that helps them develop problem vocabulary and then help them by developing solution vocabulary and then help them by showing them the options, which includes whatever you're offering and then how to choose between alternatives. And finally, why you're the best of the best. We normally start writing way too late.

[00:21:10.730] - Speaker 1
And it means that whoever was writing back here has developed trust with that audience, and they're going to go there before they come to us. And so our job is to go, oh, you know what? I need to actually think about writing to people who don't even know I exist and haven't even thought about this and don't know the words we use. If I was going to go buy a new boat, the only word I know is his boat. So if you're like, Well, what kind of boat do you want?

[00:21:35.680] - Speaker 1
I'm like one that goes on the water. I don't know what a deck boat is. And I don't know what a boatrider is. And if I saw a picture of a deck boat and a boatrider, they look so close to me that I think they're the same kind of boat. I don't have problem vocabulary or solution vocabulary, and it's your job to teach it to me and write articles that capture me so that by the time I become educated in the space, I trust you.

[00:22:00.630] - Speaker 1
You're the one that's been helping me, of course. And just because we're saying this is our goal doesn't mean that I have to write one kind of article. I can write lots of different kinds of articles. The real trick for us is to pick where I'm at in the life cycle model and then pick one of these types and say, Now let's bring these together and write it. And I know you're thinking, yeah, okay, cool framework.

[00:22:21.740] - Speaker 1
But how do I write all this? This is not easy stuff. Well, I'm not done. I want to show you a couple more frameworks, right? What I've done is take eight different kinds of posts, the kinds of posts that will likely be all the kind of stuff you're going to write about.

[00:22:39.430] - Speaker 1
Right. And these are not the subjects of it. These are the kind of posts you're writing. And so what I will tell you is there are some posts that our mindset. This is here's how you ought to think about this.

[00:22:54.820] - Speaker 1
And that's different than HowTo articles, which is problem-solving, which is different than Niche or spotlight. Look at someone who's doing something super cool, which may be like a case study. And then you have toolsets, which are these are the tools to use. And in every case, there's a framework for how do you fill in the blanks? How do you write this content faster?

[00:23:14.470] - Speaker 1
What you'll see is in a mindset I want to tell you. Hey, first, let me introduce you to this whole notion of what this mindset is about. I might name the mindset, and then I want to tell you, where does this apply? Right. Like, if you're in this situation here's how to think about this problem.

[00:23:30.940] - Speaker 1
And I want to start by telling you this is how most people think about it, and they're not correct. And then I want to give you the new frame. Here's a new way to think about it. And if you do, here are the results. You can see how this literally just tells you.

[00:23:46.900] - Speaker 1
Okay. I know what I need to put into this post to get a Mindset post completed. Well, we've all read HowTo articles. Right. And that's the here's the challenge you're facing.

[00:23:57.900] - Speaker 1
Here's what you're trying to get done or accomplished. Here are the tools you're going to need. Now let's walk through the specific steps. And then finally, here's the result. Here's the after, right.

[00:24:10.430] - Speaker 1
It's not hard, especially if you have multiple people writing content for you. You want them writing all using the same frame. And even if it's just you writing, you want every time you write another one of these to have something that becomes easier and easier over time. That's what these frames do for Niche or Spotlight. Hey, today I want to tell you about this discovery I made.

[00:24:32.700] - Speaker 1
I want to tell you how I found this person or this company and the backstory. And now what I'm going to do is I'm going to showcase I'm going to put a spotlight on them and tell you what they do and why it's so amazing. And then I'm going to give you the takeaways here's why this is important to you. And lastly, I want to encourage you to take action or to do something like what they've done. Then, of course, there are two sets.

[00:24:57.790] - Speaker 1
Right. These are the hey, if you're in this context, you've probably looked at all these other alternatives. I want to introduce you to a different approach than maybe you've used before, a different tool that you've used before. Here's my review and here's where to find it. And then the other four right.

[00:25:15.540] - Speaker 1
Promos. I know you're going to say but I don't want to pitch myself and you go, I get it right. I understand that. But one out of every eight posts isn't a lot of promotion, and at some point, you have to tell people what it is you do. So hey, here's the context that we found a lot of our customers in.

[00:25:33.370] - Speaker 1
And here's why we created the service or built the product that we did. Here's the problem it solves. Let me show you how it works. And here's why I want you to hire me or buy it.

[00:25:46.550] - Speaker 1
The last three are very similar in nature. How do we get more engagement? How do we drive growth? And how do we monetize now? You may say no, my customers don't need this, but I rarely find anyone who's writing content for anyone else who doesn't end up trying to help their audience grow in one way, shape or form.

[00:26:08.970] - Speaker 1
You may need one of these, or you may need all three of these, but what they basically do is they just reorder some of the same content here. And that is like, okay, what's your goal? And then these are the mistakes that you don't want to make. And here's how to evaluate where you are in your life cycle. And a strategy that given where you're at this strategy works.

[00:26:31.110] - Speaker 1
And here are the tips and tools to help you use it. This will help you get greater engagement. What if it's about growth? Here's what you're looking for in terms of goals. Now let us look at your data.

[00:26:44.100] - Speaker 1
Let's put it together. And let's talk about this strategy or tactic. And now, given this and this which one is right for you, and then how do you go and implement the kinds of controls and data collection to see if what you're doing is right. An immortal similar stuff. Right.

[00:27:02.460] - Speaker 1
Introduction here's a strategy. Here's how to do it. Here's what you need to be aware of. And here are some additional resources to learn more about it. What you've seen in this one, two, and a two-part of three frameworks is all the content that has helped me.

[00:27:20.990] - Speaker 1
This year produces a single blog post every single day of the year. That includes weekends. It's every single day. There's no days where I'm traveling and I skip one or days where I'm sick and I skip one. I think we're on 319 or something.

[00:27:35.060] - Speaker 1
And for 319 days this year and the first day or the last day of last year, I've written a post every single day for a period of three years, six years before this. I also wrote every day for three years straight. I'm able to do that because of these frameworks, and I believe with these frameworks, you can do the same as well. Thank you. Take care.

**Transcript:**
[00:00:00.440] - Daniella Schoeman
Hello, everyone. I'm so excited that you're here. My name is Daniella. I'm the founder of Wildly Successful Travelpreneurs and a blogger over at Our Soulful Travels. And today I'm going to be chatting with you about the art of the pitch and specifically how to land your very first travel sponsorship as a blogger. Now it's all very exciting, but before we get into it, allow me to quickly introduce myself. Hi, I'm Daniella Schoeman. That's me and my adorable little boy Kai in the photo while we were on a sponsored stay in a luxury tree house when he was only three months old. That was actually his third time on a sponsored stay with me, and he's almost two now. And together as a family, we've been on tons of sponsored stays all over the world. So I've been in the travel industry for the past seven years when I shifted the niche of my wellness blog to wellness travel about mid-2016. I landed my first sponsorships in 2017, and those were a one night comp stay at a hotel in Brussels, a media rate stay at a hotel in Amsterdam, and City Passes for two people in Brussels, Ghent, and Amsterdam.

[00:01:17.620] - Daniella
Amazingly, I accomplished all that with a tiny blog and a brand new Instagram account. I have no other platform, no other audience. So if you're a new blogger, there's definitely hope for you. And to me, that was proof of concept, that this life was possible. But those sponsorships took literally hundreds of pictures and a ton of time, so it just wasn't sustainable. After that trip, I joined Arrivedo.com, a South America-based company, where I created neighborhood guides for hotels that were published on their platform. Within a year of starting with them, I had worked with about 45 hotels around the world, and was one of their top travel writers. Some of those hotels paid me, some sponsored me, and some sponsored and paid me to create the travel content for them. And this is really where I honed my pitching and negotiation skills, and actually when I started teaching pitching as well. Since then, I've gone on to work as the Travel and Wellness Editor and Senior Writer for Rare Magazine, which is now TrooRa. My travel content and hotel reviews have been published in Culture Trip, Beau Monde Traveler, DRIFT Travel Magazine and Luxury Lifestyle Magazine. I've also ghostwritten dozens of articles for global brands like Japan Airlines, and even worked on the PR side of things writing press releases for travel brands, like the Banyan Tree Group.

[00:02:38.210] - Daniella
So this experience in all the different parts of the industry has given me unique insights into working with brands, magazines, PRs, and even the content marketing agencies within the travel niche. Plus, it's given me plenty of opportunities to refine my pitches and land those high value travel sponsorships and paid partnerships that most of us are looking for. Now I'm on a mission to teach aspiring travelpreneurs and travel bloggers like you how to get published, how to earn an income from the travel content you're already creating, and most of all, how to land travel sponsorships by learning how to pitch.

[00:03:16.650] - Daniella
Now that you know why I have the experience to talk to you about this topic, I want to make sure that you get the absolute most out of this session. So please take a moment to put your phones on do not disturb mode. I'll close out all the other tabs and get ready to take some notes. Let's go ahead and dive into what you're going to learn today. Since this training is aimed at beginners, I wanted to make it as accessible as possible. It will focus on how to pitch brands for sponsorship, not payments specifically. However, I genuinely believe that all travel content creators deserve to be paid. It takes a lot of time and effort and skills to create travel content, so you need to learn how to charge your worth. But it takes time. I also know that the first sponsorship can be really hard to land and especially nerve-wrecking to pitch, especially if you're a new blogger. So I hope that you use what you learned here today as a stepping stone to land your first sponsorship. And then once you've done that, use that win as a springboard towards paid partnerships. We all need to start somewhere, and this presentation is designed to give you the right foundations.

[00:04:24.800] - Daniella
The first thing you'll learn today is why your follower count, engagement rates, and blog stats really don't matter to brands. It's true. This is a huge block for most bloggers who think that their stats are insignificant and that they have nothing worthwhile to offer to brands. If this is your mindset, then you're not even going to try. It's important that we start by dispelling this myth that followers or sessions are the only way to work with brands. Then I'm going to share what actually matters to brands, as well as the various different ways that you can work with travel brands, as well as my number one tip for landing your first travel sponsorship as a new blogger.

[00:05:03.830] - Daniella
Next, we're going to tackle the four common pitching mistakes that most bloggers make. So pitching is an art, and even the most talented creators can stumble when it comes to reaching out to brands and hotels. Through my experience coaching, aspiring travel content creators, I've observed some recurring mistakes that can really get in the way of you landing your sponsorships. So I'm going to shed some light on these common mistakes, but more importantly, I'm going to equip you with the knowledge and techniques to avoid them or fix them in the future. By addressing these mistakes, you're going to be better equipped to craft, persuasive and successful pitches that really capture the attention of sponsors and open doors to exciting opportunities for you. I'm also going to reveal to you the one and only goal of your initial pitch so that you know exactly what to focus on once we get into that next section.

[00:05:54.960] - Daniella
Finally, we'll delve into the seven crucial components of a successful pitch. Mastering these can really boost your success rate and neglecting them could lead to ignored emails. Luckily, once you know what goes into a successful pitch, you can repeat the process over and over again with confidence. And once you know the winning pitch formula, I'll give you two options for how you can approach pitching and provide you with a handy resource to make the best option a lot easier. Okay, so now that you know where we're going, let's go ahead and get started. I hope you're ready because I'm super excited to share my pitching secrets with you.

[00:06:36.360] - Daniella
You've probably been told that you need thousands of followers or blog sessions to work with brands or get sponsored to stay at a hotel. I'm here to tell you that this is not true. It's what I like to call the follower count myth. So there are plenty of ways to work with brands, and not all of them rely solely on your follower count or traffic. Now, this is a common misconception, and it's left over from the days when influencer marketing was really new and there was really only one way to work with brands. For example, you would post something on your Instagram or publish a blog post and hope and pray that it gets enough engagement for the brand's approval. But you need to understand that the industry has been shifting over the past few years. There's more of a focus on user-generated content, UGC. Let's get real. If you're pitching to create content that brands will share on their own platforms, be it their website, social media, email campaigns, or blogs, they are not losing sleep over your follower count or even you personally. What truly matters to brands is the quality of the content that you produce for them. So in that case, I want you to view your blog or social media platforms as a portfolio that showcases to brands the quality of work they can expect from you. The engagement doesn't matter to them. So you need to shift your focus from the numbers game to the content creation game if you want to work with brands. And that's the mindset you're going to need going into the rest of this training. When it comes to collaborating with hotels and other travel brands, there are three different approaches you can take, and I'm going to go into each of them with you. One, you can provide a service. Two, you can offer exposure. Or three, you can do both. If you don't have a follower account or traffic to offer the brand much exposure, then you're going to opt for providing a service.

[00:08:29.900] - Daniella
And this is a seriously cool way of supporting the tourism industry practically with a skill or service that you already have experience in or isn't too far out of your comfort zone. Best of all, you don't have to be a social media guru to do this at all. You just need to be great in the industry you're currently working in or have experience in and know how to pitch, which is something I'm going to teach you here. However, you can even supercharge your collaborations by combining high value services with exposure, and this will result in more sponsorships and a higher likelihood of paid partnerships for you. There are thousands of services that you can provide. You can provide hotels and exchange for a come stay or brand in exchange for a product like a set of luggage. The great thing about providing a service is that they're usually really high value and you can easily adjust the scope to take a collaboration from a sponsorship to a paid partnership once you're more comfortable working with brands. Some of the services my students and I have offered travel brands in the past are website development or management, photography or videography, social media management, graphic design, copywriting, that could be web copy, email copy or blog posts, SEO services, or writing reviews for magazines.

[00:09:50.000] - Daniella
So this is my personal favorite and how I work with most brands. And it has the added benefit of combining offering a service, writing the reviews for them and providing them with exposure through the brand, social media, the brand's traffic… Sorry, through the magazine's social media, through the magazine's traffic that they get. So it's really a win-win-win situation collaboration. However, I'm always trying to broaden my expertise and think outside of the box when it comes to collaboration so that I can offer as much value to the tourism industry as possible. The opportunities are endless. Simply combine your own skills and expertise with what the brand needs and you've got a winning formula. Now, if you're still feeling unsure about pitching brands or for your first travel sponsorship, I'm going to suggest that you start local. That is my number one tip for new bloggers. Local could be your hometown, your home state or province, or even your home country, as long as you're very familiar with the destination. Think about it. Creating content for a local hotel or your local tourism board is much easier than if you were to go international. You're already an expert in the destination. You have knowledge that other creators might not have about that area, and this makes it so much easier to convince a brand to work with you specifically. For example, I recently took a group of 20 creators through a pitching challenge aimed specifically at pitching their local tourism brands. Many of them were new bloggers without an established following, and amazingly, 95% of them were able to land at least one sponsorship during the challenge, and most of them landed multiple partnerships. So if you want a low risk and high reward pitching challenge, I suggest starting with your local tourism brands.

[00:11:44.430] - Daniella
But before we get into the next section, I have a question for you. What is the main or only goal of your initial email pitch to a travel brand? In other words, what do you think it needs to accomplish? Please drop your answers in the chat box below. I'm going to answer you soon.

[00:12:03.230] - Daniella
Now let's talk about the four common mistakes in pitching that many travel bloggers make. Mistake number one: your pitch is too long. Think about it. How do you feel if you receive a lengthy email, it feels like reading a novel. It's overwhelming, right? You lose concentration, your attention begins to waver. Keep that in mind when writing your pitch too. The shorter, the sweeter. When it comes to pitching, treat your pitch like a captivating blurb, not a 10-page essay. Within just a few sentences, you should be able to grab their attention and leave them wanting to know more.

[00:12:41.180] - Daniella
Mistake number two: you start negotiating right away. While enthusiasm is essential, revealing all your cards in your initial pitch may not be the best approach. It usually isn't. Discussing fees, assets, and deliverables too soon can come across as desperate. Your goal is to pique their interest and creates a desire to learn more about working with you. Leave negotiation discussions for a later stage, please.

[00:13:08.740] - Daniella
Mistake number three: it's all about you. I know you're awesome and you should definitely be proud of your achievements but a pitch focused solely on self-praise will definitely not resonate with brands. You need to strike a balance by providing a brief introduction about yourself, but keep the spotlight on conveying the value that you can offer them. So you need to align your pitch with their needs and their objectives.

[00:13:35.350] - Daniella
Mistake number four: you attach a media kit. I know that other coaches tend to advise that you attach your media kit, but I don't suggest that you do that, and here's why. While media kits are valuable assets, attaching one to your pitch can stop the conversation in its tracks. Think about it. If you give the brand all the information, there's no intrigue, and in my experience, it prevents brands from replying more often than not. What you should do instead is wait for the brand to express interest and request your media kit. This approach increases the likelihood of a reply and opens up a genuine dialog about potential collaborations. So by avoiding these common pitfalls and tailoring your pitches to each brand, you increase your chances of landing those coveted sponsorships. When it comes to pitching, you really need to approach it from the right mindset. Remember that if you're doing this correctly, you're not asking for something free. Get that out of your head. You are offering a value exchange. Collaboration is beneficial for both parties. When writing a pitch, you don't ask for something, especially not in the first one. That's how you make sure that your emails get ignored or deleted, and that's not what we want.

[00:14:53.810] - Daniella
Instead, you're offering something. It's easy to ignore a creator that is asking for something right off the bat. It's much harder to ignore a creator who is offering something. That's why it's really important that you include the right information in your initial pitch, and that's what we're going to get to soon. Finally, I want you to understand that the one and only goal of your initial pitch is to get a response. We're not negotiating, we're not signing a deal, we're not getting the contracts ready. You want the brand to open up your email, read it, and then respond to you. The response itself is irrelevant. You will get nos more often than not, at least at first. You have to get used to it. You'll get requests for more information, which begins the negotiation phase, which is what we want most of all. And sometimes you'll get a yes straight away, and that's amazing. Regardless of the response, if you get a reply to your email, then you know that your pitch is working as intended. How do you ensure that you get a response to your pitches? You make sure that it has all the right elements, and that is what we're going to discuss next.

[00:16:08.750] - Daniella
But first, tell me, do you know what the average response rate of a cold email or pitch is? So a pitch is basically just a cold email and it has an average response rate, which is pretty low. But if you know, please drop your answers in the chat box, and I'm going to reveal the surprising percentage very soon. So most people make pitching a lot more complicated than it needs to be. It's really not that complex. A pitch is basically just a cold email and there are proven methods for success with cold emails. Unfortunately, the average response rate for a cold email is 8.5%. That's pretty low. It means that a pitch won't work every single time and you just have to get used to it. 91.5% of the time your pitch won't be successful, but it's that 8.5% that really counts. Just because the average response rate is low doesn't mean that you can't increase your odds. You can, you totally can. You do it by optimizing your pitch in such a way that it prompts a response. The following elements are essential for pitch, and you need to make sure that you include all of them whenever you're pitching.

[00:17:28.900] - Daniella
The first element is the subject line. You need to come up with a captivating subject line, when that grabs the recipient's attention right away within all the emails and the inbox. You need to keep it concise, intriguing and relevant to your pitch. So for example, you could make your subject line ""Collaboration opportunity: Let's showcase your brand to a global audience."" I like to A/B test my subject lines on a regular basis. So what I'll do is I'll craft two different subject lines for each pitch campaign (you can use ChatGPT to do this), and then I'll send half the pitches with one subject line and the other half of the pitches with another subject line. I then compare them to see which of them gets more responses and opens as well. This type of experimentation allows me to see what works and what doesn't work for my particular niche and each different campaign. You can then refine it over time until you have a subject line you know that works for you every single time.

[00:18:33.770] - Daniella
The next element is the greeting. Begin with a personalized greeting to establish a connection with the recipient. Whenever possible, use a relevant contact's name. This means that you need to do some research or digging on LinkedIn to find out who is in charge of partnerships for the brand. This could be a Marketing Manager, a general manager, a press director, owner, or even a PR agent at a third-party agency. It is up to you to find out who the decision maker is and address them directly in your pitch.

[00:19:05.930] - Daniella
The third element is the introduction. Introduce yourself briefly and mention your role as a travel content creator. Keep it concise and highlight any relevant achievements or experiences that make you uniquely qualified to work with that brand. This is where people make the most mistakes when it comes to pitching. Most people add way too much information about themselves, and this can make the pitch too long. People stop reading it. Whenever you're in doubt, remember that your pitch is about the brand, not about you. Keep it short. Give them your name, your blog name, your business name. Mention what type of travel content you create, so your niche. If you have a really unique stat, such as follower engagement, views count, or whatever, or write for an esteemed publication, then you might mention it here too, otherwise, leave it out.

[00:19:59.110] - Daniella
The fourth element is an explanation for why you're contacting them. Include a sentence that will be used to explain why you're reaching out to that brand specifically. This will help you to personalize your pitch a lot more. For example, if I was reaching out to one of my local tourism brand, I would say something like, I'm reaching out because I'm a South African based in Mossel Bay and I'm deeply familiar with the Garden Route, which means that I can provide you with specialized content that only a local could create. You could add a sentence that will showcase your enthusiasm for their brand, products or services. You could also include a sentence that briefly mentions how you discovered them or what caught your attention about their brand in the first place. The fifth element is outlining the benefits of a partnership. Now this is where we get into the juicy bits, a.k.a. the stuff that the brand really, really cares about. Draft a sentence or two that will highlight the potential benefits of partnering with you, for instance, your local knowledge. Use this section to emphasize the value that you can provide, such as increased exposure, engaging content, access to your audience, or the specialized services that you can provide.

[00:21:19.440] - Daniella
Focus on how collaboration could mutually benefit both of you, so you and the brand. Remember that the benefits you'd highlight would vary from brand to brand, so this is a very personalized or customized part of the pitch. The sixth element is a call to action or CTA. This is really important and a huge reason why most people don't get replies to their pitches. You need to include a clear and concise call to action when that direct the recipients onto the next steps. You shouldn't leave them confused about what to do next. Your CTA could ask them to respond to get more information, such as your media kits or red card to keep the conversation going. Or it can ask them to schedule a quick call with you. You can add a calendar link to make it really easy for them. Or anything else that encourages them to reply or respond in some way. As we talked about earlier, remember that goal of your initial pitch is not to secure the sponsorship or partnership. The goal is to open up lines of communication with the brand. So use your CTA as a way to keep the conversation going.

[00:22:29.180] - Daniella
The final element of a successful pitch is the closing. You want to wrap up the email with a polite and professional closing. Thank the recipient for their time and consideration. I like to throw it in there, ""I look forward to your reply"" as well, because this acts as another prompt to get them to respond. Include your contact information and website or social media handles for easy reference, and make sure that your email signature looks professional. Now that you know the elements needed to write a successful pitch, it's time to learn how to use that information.

[00:23:05.850] - Daniella
Okay, now before I end this presentation, I want to go over a few action steps with you based on what we've discussed. So your first step would be to figure out what services you could offer brands. Take some time to list out some of the services or experience or skills that you have. This could be services you provide to clients already or other skills or expertise that you have. Next, you need to find the travel brands you want to pitch. If you're taking my advice and then starting local, then you probably have a few hotels or attractions or tourism boards in mind already. Create a list of at least five, but preferably 10 brands to pitch. Remember, it's a numbers game. Then you need to do some research. First, you'll need to find the right person to contact at each brand and the email address. So name and email address for direct contact is important. You need a direct email address, not a general one for the best results. So take some time to do a Google search, check out their websites, reach out on social media, check for press releases. Linkedin is always a great option as well. Once you have the contact details evaluate the brand to determine which of your services they most likely need. For example, check their website. If they don't have any photos on their website or social media and they have the poor quality, then they could use your photography skills if you have them. Once again, you're going to be stalking them a little bit, checking out the website, social media, anything that you can find online about them, and then use that to evaluate a fit between your skills and their needs. Once you know what to offer each of the brands you want to pitch, it's time to craft a pitch template. You can do that either using the formula that I just shared with you or use the freebie that I'm giving away to all Summit attendees. Finally, make sure to personalize the template for each and every brand you pitch. You are not going to send the same pitch to every single brand that needs to be customized for the best results. Then double-check that all the information is correct, all the placeholder text has been filled, and check your spelling and grammar, as well. And then once you're ready, hit send. Happy pitching, friends.

[00:25:22.100] - Daniella
Now, do you have any questions? Please drop them in the chat box below. I'm happy to answer or clarify anything that I went over during this presentation. I'll answer them in the chat or maybe in the Summit Facebook group as well. So when it comes to writing pitches, there are two options available to you. You could start from scratch every single time. So starting from scratch, each time you want to pitch a new brand may help you to avoid those pitch template blunders, for example, ""dear, first name in brackets,"" but it's time-consuming, and it's going to limit the number of pitches you send. I want you to remember something. Pitching is a numbers game, especially in the beginning, you want to send as many as possible. And to do that, you need to make pitching a habit and create a weekly or monthly pitching schedule. If you have to start from scratch with each email pitch, you might not be able to keep up with that schedule or you'll just send a lot less than you actually could. Your other option is to use a template.

[00:26:22.650] - Daniella
Using a template is a great way to speed up the process. It helps you to overcome writer's block and gives you a starting point. That way you don't procrastinate or stare at a blank page waiting for inspiration trying to figure out what to say. And if you're a new blogger who hasn't pitched before, this is something that's going to stand in your way. So you can save time that can rather be spent on doing brand research for personalisation or customisation. But if you've ever downloaded or bought someone else's pitch templates and you know that although they provided you with the script, it tends to lack an explanation on exactly how to use it or customize it. These templates also tend to be generic and they don't always follow a winning pitch formula that includes all the elements you need for a pitch. Plus, you usually need to customize a lot to make it really sound like you or let your own personality shine through. But what if you could craft your very own pitch templates, build the solutions so that you can have the convenience of a template, but still have it sound like you so that you can see more success. So in order to help you with crafting your own pitch template, I created the Craft Your Own Pitch Template workbook. This workbook will guide you through creating your own pitch template based on the seven elements of a successful pitch that I shared with you today. With step-by-step guidance and a fill-in-the-blank workbook, this toolkit will walk you through building a pitch template that really gets results. Once your template is complete, you'll be able to tweak it and update it in just a few minutes for any new pitch opportunity. Just swap in the brand specifics where you have placeholder text and your perfect pitch is ready to send. Stop wasting time trying to fit your unique personal brand into someone else's pitch formula.

Eric Hochberger [00:00:41]:
Yeah. So my background funny enough is actually in SEO and not in ads. So I've been doing SEO, like I say, since before Google was a thing in, like, 1996/1997, like,

Eric Hochberger [00:00:52]:
is actually when I first started. My first job in 1998 was doing SEO, for, like, a local company down here in South Florida. So I've been doing this for a while, and that's actually how Mediavine got to start in 2004. So my background is in as SEO as SEO can be.

Awesome. and can you just a touch on sort of what we'll learn today in in your presentation.

Eric Hochberger [00:01:20]:
Yeah. so today, I'm gonna be focusing on if people have ever read my parboil post on the Mediavine blog that's, I don't know, infamous, maybe only amongst media vine people, but it's gonna be kind of related content. How can you use related content to boost the rankings of your top performing posts. So it's really about improving rankings of your existing posts more so than anything, and it's gonna focus a lot on content strategy.

Liz Stapleton [00:01:43]:
Yeah. Because it's it's, way easier to boost something that's already ranking somewhat than it is to, like, start a whole new piece of content, which Yes. That's good and important too, but, yeah, so I'm excited. I'm gonna let you kind of take over and and I might pop in with a question you're in there.

Eric Hochberger [00:02:02]:
Please. I like to get a little technical at times. So if it's too technical, stop me. I I would love that.

Liz Stapleton [00:02:07]:
Okay.

Eric Hochberger [00:02:12]:
Alright. You can see my screen. We're ready to go. Alright. Let's do it. Alright. So as Liz said, we're gonna be talking about SEO today from, kind of a quick Crash course at the beginning. I'm gonna go over kind of my style of SEO, and then we're gonna go into all the fun related keywords we were talking about and related content. First, again, why is an ad guy talking about SEO? because, again, this is my background, and this is Mediavine background. 16 years ago, we were actually an SEO for hire firm far before we got into ads. So any of the better question is why is this SEO company talking to me about ads all the time? But, no. It's fine. we're definitely more of an ad network company now. but honestly, one of the biggest reasons you should listen to us is because of the Hollywood gossip. some people don't know this, but Mediavine started the Hollywood gossip in 2006. We owned and operate that site, and it was at the time three guys knew nothing about celebrity gossip, but knew a lot about SEO. We use those tricks to grow the Hollywood gossip into about 30 to 60,000,000 page views a month is one of the largest gossip sites on the internet. We still use these practices today. so the stuff I'm preaching, actually works in the real world. today's focus is mostly gonna be on not the Hollywood gossip, though, because I don't know if that's address relatable to most, people that will be listening to this. So instead we're gonna focus on Sugar dish me, which is actually a blog run by our director of publisher support, Heather. This is her own personal blog. And it's a food blog. and, basically, we're gonna go over the strategy we did for her site, which is using Google search console to identify some of the top keywords she's ranking for. We develop new content and linking strategies around those, top ranking posts. then she created new posts. use that linking strategy. We made a few content tweaks, to the post itself. and we're gonna follow along and, obviously, it worked, or I wouldn't be using it as the case study. so quickly, before we get into all of the content strategy, because a lot of it does involve tweaks you're gonna be making, I wanna go over kind of the basics and my interpretation stuff, and this is what I like to call my little disclosure. this in general, is my style of SEO, and it's maybe a little oversimplified from what people are used to. And that's because I kind of ignored the SEO experts and most of the algorithm changes. I believe in kind of the theory of content is king. write good content. It will rank well in Google. Ignore the individual algorithm changes. I know a lot of people were hurt by the recent verts or whatever the the recent algorithm is named. It's important to remember this stuff is all a 0 sum game, or, basically, some people gain traffic, some people lose traffic. generally, the people who gain traffic tend to be a little quieter right now. they don't wanna kinda commiserate in everyone's losses. So people did gain from this, and that's what we've seen at Mediavine. A lot of our publishers gain, a lot lost. Unfortunately, that's just a nature of an algorithm change. What's important to focus on is not the name of the algorithm. It's what changed, right, what Google tells you to change. That's kinda my mantra. Listen to Google, focus on good content. When Google's recommendation changes, you should change how you're doing stuff. And overall, the strategy has worked for us. We've been through so many algorithm changes over the years, and the Hollywood gossip is still ranking well. You're gonna gain some. You're gonna lose some. Zoom out. keep writing good content and just listen when Google tells you something changes. Alright. Let's get in with it. Alright. So we're gonna be talking a lot about keywords today. but interestingly, I'm gonna go to back to the basics of what we define as keyword as because weirdly so often, I think I have a definite different definition of a keyword than what a lot of bloggers do. So when I say keywords, I really mean, I think key phrases a lot of times, you'll hear the industry call these as long tail keywords. So an example, sorry, it's gonna be very food heavy, cheesecake, versus low carb strawberry cheesecake recipe. In this example, a lot of people would say cheesecake is the keyword or strawberry is the cheesecake or even recipe. Those are not really the keywords you should be looking at. You should be looking at the whole thing as your keyword. Low carb strawberry cheesecake recipe. And that's what's called a long tail keyword. So a short tail keyword is something like cheesecake. It is a bigger search, and you may think I wanna go after the bigger search. That's not actually a useful search for you. We're gonna tell you that the long tail is more useful for your site. The reason why is it comes down to intent of the searcher. what is the reader actually looking for? In cheesecake, you have no idea. Are they looking to buy cheesecake? Are they looking to figure out what cheesecake is? I have no idea what they're searching for. They're just looking for pictures of cheesecake. You have no idea about a low carb strawberry cheesecake recipe. You know, if you're a recipe blogger, you have that for them. That is your exact user you want. They're gonna be more valuable for you. Sign up for your newsletter, become an engaged reader that's gonna keep coming back. So they're even better for you. Plus, the good news is there's a lot more of them. They make up about 70% searches on the internet, and they're a lot easier for you to win, as an independent publisher compared to the big guys who are going after the big turns. So everything we're talking about in key phrase, even though I'm gonna keep saying the word keyword, key phrase. And this is just the basics of a page title. Hopefully, everyone knows what a page title is. It's, you know, the name of your post, and Yost, they call it the SEO title. The key here that I think a lot of people miss is that key phrase that we're talking about. Make sure you use it in the page title as much as you can in its entirety, not broken up, So back to the previous example, you have to use that whole thing, low carb strawberry cheesecake recipe if that's what you're going after, and put it towards the beginning You'll see this hilariously all over the Hollywood gossip where we'll begin with Kate Middleton pregnant. She's not actually pregnant right now. Right? I don't know. I I'm not actually gonna tell her to gossip, but we'll begin with that and then a colon and then the rest of the headline. So we'll always begin with that key phrase that we're going after or that key word And that's that's important. if you want to have a more clickable title, you wanna add more stuff to it. Completely understood. But the reason why beginning with it is so important There's this thing called keyword prominence, but we, okay. In the English language, we read left to right, and it's really important that you have your key phrase at the beginning because when you're looking down that column of search results, you're looking from left to right. Make sure your key phrase is at the beginning. We're just gonna highlight it. You're gonna become more clickable. and Google in general does have page title. It's a pretty high ranking signal. So put your key phrase towards the beginning. Seems like obvious advice after you hear someone say it out loud, but nobody follows this for some weird reason, follow it. and it will definitely help with rankings. Alright. Quick little summation on content formatting and linking. I've, actually, a pretty good blog post on this on the Mediavine blog, so I'm gonna go short into this, but write more. More is better when it comes to SEO. I like to say 3 to 500 words minimum. And the reason why is because the more content you're writing, the more phrases you're just gonna get in there you're gonna be able to rank for more long tail keywords. It won't necessarily help you with your ranking of that post itself because Google is just looking Are you an expert on this one particular topic? And maybe it only takes you a 100 words to do that, but if you can get more key phrases in there, there's more chances for you to rank. You're not just going for ranking on one key phrase. You might rank on other key phrases as a result of doing this. So, right, as much content as you can. once you start running into things, don't start doing fluff. nobody wants that. Certainly not Google. So if you can only answer this question a 100 words, I guess, stop at that point, but maybe rethink how you're writing, if you read my personal SEO blog posts or any of my ad posts on the Mediavine blog, they're all over a 1000 words. and I'm talking about ads So that's not that exciting. I feel like you could probably get whatever your topic is, you're passionate about it. 3 to 500 should be your minimum. Mhmm. and, again, aim for more. always use web friendly paragraphs. I'm obsessed with this, but I would say, look at it on a mobile phone. If you just do what you're taught in school, 3, 4, 5, or 6, sentence long paragraphs, they're gonna look like a giant block of text on your phone, break them up, hit enter more often, put photos in there. It's a more engaging experience for a user. It's super important that you have a good engaging experience. Remember, Google, wants to send users to a page that they're going to consume the content and enjoy the experience. When Google sends you someone to a page, they're basically recommending that page. Google looks at is their traffic. They're sending it to your site. They want that user to have a good user experience. just why a lot of people always say user experience kinda drives SEO. and again, just like your page title, make sure you use that key phrase early on in your post. but don't stuff. I see a lot of people do this, but they'll try to use that keyword throughout the entire post, and they use it unnaturally. Yeah. Like, I get the

Liz Stapleton [00:11:04]:
green light in the Yoast or whatever. Yeah. No. Don't.

Eric Hochberger [00:11:08]:
I'm gonna bite my tongue on so much thing so many things about Yoast, but don't obsess. for those lights in general. We

Liz Stapleton [00:11:13]:
we've already covered that in other sessions of of it's a good guideline, but don't obsess about it. Don't stress.

Eric Hochberger [00:11:19]:
Exactly. Exactly. Don't stress. That is literally my mantra of all this stuff. Sending them and related phrases are better, if anything, than using that same keyword. And when it's linking, linking is more important than your content itself. Google judges you based on your links, and that is internal and external. I'm not gonna go too deep into this because, actually, again, I have a blog post and a video on page rank, super complex topic. lot of people don't talk about Page rank anymore in 2020. I think that's crazy. page rank is literally the original algorithm that started Google. It is named after Larry Page himself, one of founders. I have a video that explains kinda how page rank works, but what it comes down to is links our votes in the Google system, and you can vote for yourself. and you can vote multiple times. it's a little different in that, you know, if you vote for two people now and you divide your votes in half, if you vote for ten people, you divide your votes in 10 Again, I'm not gonna go into the whole thing of page rank, but this is basically the crux of what we're gonna be doing today is the linking strategy. So it's important to note, that who you link to or what you link to says as much about your page as what links to you. so be careful on what you linked to only link to related stuff. whenever possible. You're gonna wanna do something that's called basically sculpting your page rank or making sure that you are structuring, your link structure, and then in a way that is highlighting your valuable content. So I like to use this little silo chart that we made teal here. It's important to note your homepage is almost always gonna be your highest ranking thing. The thing that has the most votes or the most page rank. The reason why is because most people that link to you typically link on your homepage, and I can guarantee you have a link to your homepage on every single page on your site. So if out of doubt, your homepage will always be your most valuable page. something I always like to think of is how far away is the content I'm trying to rank for from the home page? How many links away? and this is why you'll often see people use what's called cornerstone content in the Yoast world or silos or categories, whatever you wanna call them, you're gonna use these to basically sculpt your pagerank. Your homepage should always link to these and your article should always link back to them. Think about that as you're writing any of the posts we're gonna be talking about later. How can I link back to my style. And don't worry that we'll be coming back to this. This is kind of the the the briefer overview. So again, got your supporting post, that help boost up that cornerstone. And that cornerstone obviously sends the the page rank back up to the home page, but the important thing is the home page is linking to that corner stone as well. So you're you're going to have to link a lot, basically, is what it's gonna come down to. I often hear this question, how often should you how many internal links should you have on a post? And it's not important to think about how many. It's more about how often so, yes, I mentioned you are dividing up your post or your page rank when you link to multiple things. That's okay. Don't worry about that. dividing it up and voting for yourself is good. Vote a lot for yourself. It's the only links you can control. The important thing is not to over saturate your article with links. I hate seeing a bolded list of links, like, at the end of a post. I know a lot of people used to do that or a bunch of images that are just your links. Google reads the words around your links just as much as they use the or text itself, because it's a contextual search engine at the end of the day. so as long as you're following kind of this idea of I'm going to have a lot of words around each of my links. You can never overlink. So, you know, link once or twice per paragraph. Think about it that way. and just add more paragraphs if you wanna add more links. You will never have too many links if you write with that style. And the more it is better, I promise you. As long as it's good for user experience. So link to things that are related. Again, going back to that silo. External linking, I know a lot of bloggers like to avoid this, but links are just as important as internal links. What and that's what you link to and who links to you. Both are important. Yeah. It's actually important to link out to people and make them do follow links. Stop with the rel equals no follow. That's not helping anyone. You should only be using that if it's for kind of an affiliate or something you're being paid for. Right? Never use temp for linking to another blogger unless that blogger is paying you. but always keep the ratio of as many internal links as you can to extra links. So if you use 1 extra link, make sure you have, like, 5 to 10 internal links more if you can. keep the page ranked to yourself. Give a little bit of it out. Show Google, hey. This is the topic I'm talking about. Always try to link to an authority. don't freak out that authority is going to outrank you. They're probably already outranking you if they're an authority, rank alongside them, like, rise together. Alright. Now let's get into the good stuff. all the kind of basics are over that I'm gonna be kind of referring back to. I just wanna make sure we're all on the same page with my definition of those basics.

Liz Stapleton [00:16:09]:
Yes.

Eric Hochberger [00:16:11]:
Alright. So Google search console. It's a little bit of an older screenshot. you can see from the dates here in August, they may have changed. They've added new features in then. but this one is still there. and this is going to be basically your free tool to figure out what your pages are ranking and which ones you should improve your rankings So it's free. Everyone has it. You don't need to split it. A cost at SEM SemRush with 5 of your buddies. You can. SemRush is awesome. it's a great tool, but this one is free and even better because it's exact data from the only person that has the exact data. Google. so what you're gonna wanna do is go into the performance, tab in the side and click on, Google search results, basically. and I have step by step instructions here. And you're gonna wanna add the average position to make sure you get the ranking. That's not on by default. that's gonna show you your ranking on these keywords, and it's not there again, but it's also added in. and then you're gonna wanna store it by either clicks or impression. clicks or how many people come to your page. I prefer impressions. That's how many times you were shown. You know, if you're in the top

Liz Stapleton [00:17:14]:
10,

Eric Hochberger [00:17:14]:
you might not get a lot of clicks to your post, but you'll definitely still get a lot of impressions, because people will see the ranking. They just might not click on it because not everyone clicks on result 10 or 20 or 30. but then most people click on the top 3 as you can find out. So what we're gonna be looking for, or we also wanna expand the date range to as long as we can, or at least the last 3 months, you're not just focusing on your most recent stuff, and look for terms, you're in the top 10. but not ranked number 1. That's not useful. We're not here to improve your number 1 ranking. We're gonna leave that alone. Maybe you wanna maintain that ranking and shoot a couple links over to it. But chances are you may know a lot of the terms you rank for. You're looking for stuff. You have 2 through

Eric Hochberger [00:17:56]:
10.

Eric Hochberger [00:17:56]:
and then you're gonna wanna find the post that you're ranking on. You can do this by searching for Google, or there's actually a way, you can switch it over, from queries over to pages, that other tab, and it will show you which pages actually ranking there. so once you find the post, we are going to get to work on it to improve our rankings. So this one, was Heather's, post called 10 Minute Pizza Dough from 2013, and she found out she was ranking on quick Pizza dough. at the time. She was ranked somewhere in, I believe, like, 9 or 10. unfortunately, she did not maintain this. I'm gonna go into that at at the end of this. But what you're gonna wanna do is, first, you look at this post, and you could probably say, hey. It is not named correctly based on everything Eric said at the beginning. is there not even the word quick anywhere in there? And we'll get into that. but this is the post we're gonna be focusing on. 10 minute pizza dough ranking for quick pizza though, which is apparently a pretty big term, from a 2013 article, what do we do? Okay. So first off, yes. I required her to change that page title to be quicky today. I told her to add more words. She did not. you know, you can only do so much as an SEO consultant here helping people. But quick pizza dough is definitely gonna rank better than 10 minute pizza dough for the phrase quick pizza dough. She also didn't even have that key phrase anywhere early on. So you can see here I had her add a paragraph. I don't know if other bloggers besides food bloggers love to do this. Maybe everyone who gets traffic from Pinterest loves leading with some giant image at the very beginning of their post with no text because that's just like an old Pinterest adage. I don't know where it comes from.

Liz Stapleton [00:19:35]:
Yeah.

Eric Hochberger [00:19:37]:
Who knows? Yeah. let let's kill it if we can together today. get text in there early on. Google always parses text better than video images. We've got some awesome job parsing images and a freakishly good job parsing videos if you ever a Google hangout, you can turn on translations and be freaked out at how well they do at transcribing stuff. But at the end of the day, it's a lot easier for them to figure out what your text is about than those other things. So give them more text, and certainly earlier on, as I was mentioning, it's all about Prominence. How early on did you get that key phrase? If you have an image first, you're not gonna get that key phrases early on. So lead with text. This was again a compromise. She gave me 2 sentences. I would love more. I would have walls of text if were up to me before the images start coming in. But I understand you gotta balance your Pinterest, your SEO, and all your goals. Yeah. So that's fine. Get that key key phrase early on if you can. And she added more content, and this is one of my favorite tricks that we use all the time in the Hollywood gossip. I hate republishing. I know bloggers love to republish, so it shows back up in their feed. that's not what you should be doing. that's actually lying to Google because she don't realize that you're actually sending all of these dates to Google if you're running WordPress. WordPress does this automatically for you and meta tags. You're gonna say when the post is created, when it was last updated. And if you start messing with those things, you're messing with Google. And in general, don't lie to Google. it's it's not best practice. They're smart. They store these URLs. They know when they're last modified when they were created. don't republish. Heather didn't have to republish this thing. If anything, I understand you wanna link from your homepage again, and I agree. Right? That was that whole silo thing. We do wanna link from your homepage. But don't do it via republishing. it's, again, it's a trick. not a great one. We'd love to come with a solution. I have some ideas actually for a plug in to help publishers do this at some point in a way that would be Google friendly. But for now, instead, think about updating that post. in this particular example, this was a 2013 article back then, Heather used to talk a lot more about dogs than she did about pizza, in her pizza post. So she updated her post to talk a little bit more about pizza. There's still a lot of stuff about dogs in there because that's Heather. and then she added something called what I like what I like to say is getting the date in the text.

Liz Stapleton [00:21:56]:
What?

Eric Hochberger [00:21:56]:
It's a little update section saying what you updated about the post. great for the reader. Right? If they come and they see 2013, they might freak out. But if there's a big thing towards the top that says August 2019 update, and it's also gonna show up. Don't worry. In some Google searches that they're looking for. And, again, this should be 2020, old example. But, yeah, if you add that recent date in that little section, Google will parse that. You'll start seeing it show up in search results, especially when people add dates in. And it's just great for the user. Right? They're they want to know it was updated, especially your readers that might be coming back to this. Your your old readers, your 2013 readers that are wise as quick pizza dough being mentioned again, give them the updates. Chances are you've learned something about that particular topic in the last 7 years. I hope so. Right? We we all get better at these things. So a little recent date thing is awesome. Exclusively write the date, even though you are going to, like I said, WordPress is gonna mention on these things in the meta tags, always great to have it in the content for the readers and even Google. So that's what Heather did on what's called kind of the on page things. Right? The idea of what can I tweak on the page itself to improve the ranking? And it worked. and I'll go over why she kinda lost the rankings in a bit. but She went from, you can see, this was a slow and steady path. It took a few months. She kept adding Keto. and real quick, I am gonna say, because if you do search for this, you're gonna see she lost her ranking. She's now back down to

Liz Stapleton [00:23:21]:
8.

Eric Hochberger [00:23:21]:
The reason why is because I like to always think of, like, SEO as like a, like, almost like a garden. Right? You gotta maintain it. So going back to what we were saying before is once that post is so many post, pages away from the home page and you stop having this related content, you stop linking to it, you're gonna lose the ranking. And, unfortunately, we keep Heather very busy here at Mediavine doing all her job duties, and maybe she doesn't have as much time to blog about pizza dough as she'd like. So eventually she lost this ranking, but you don't have to. You can see here it was a slow and steady gain. That's one of the other things her number about SEO. even if you update a post and Google is normally super fast at indexing, right, when it comes to news content, you will see Google have all the news content within, like, 20 minutes of an article being posted on PhD. Sometimes, like, 2 or 3 minutes, freakishly fast. So I know you want your results to be that fast when you're doing this kind of stuff. It's not. it comes to reindexing older content, especially content that is not time sensitive, Google is gonna take its sweet time. so always zoom out when you're doing this stuff. don't declare this a failure because you didn't improve your rankings in a week or 2. It took literally months. You can see the slow and steady rise for Heather. And you can see this chart goes up and down. Google has multiple different data centers. They don't just do 1 or 2 or 3 updates a year, whatever they announce. they're doing updates all the time. Small little tweaks. You could literally get different search results from a friend across the country because they're hitting up a different data center. that's where you kinda see this up and down motion. Yeah. again, it comes down to that's why Google uses things like average position in here. don't obsess about your individual search result from the search you're doing. Focus on this average position to know what's working and zoom out. 3 months. Long play. Okay. So, again, a lot of lot of pretense and preface for this. So quick pizza dough is the search we're going after. oh, that's just bragging about Heather's rankings. Good for Heather. the the key is we want to create related content, as I keep saying, what can we do? So in this particular example, we're gonna think of quick pizza dough as our silo or our cornerstone content what other content can we now create under that cornerstone? You might be thinking quick pizza dough. There's no way that could be cornerstone. You cannot create a series of content around quick pizza dough. You are so wrong. I gave Heather so many posts she could write about. so one of the things you're gonna wanna do is searching Google itself for quick pizza dough. and please use incognito mode if you're a Safari user. I don't know why you are, but full search what's called private browsing in there. the reason you wanna do this is because Google is tracking you as a user and customizing search results tailored to you. And if you search, incognito, just gonna give you the general purpose search results, and that's what you care about. So here, we're gonna search for quick pizza dough, and you're gonna see there's 3 sections we're gonna or 4 sections we're talking about. people also asked my favorite. There's a related search. You can see here they got different pizza ingredients and pizza crust types. Now at the bottom is searches related to quick Pizza dough. Google is literally telling you here what content is related to quick Pizza dough. know you were just saying, I don't have any related content after I bought quick pizza though. Google has a ton of it for you. The fun part is there's even more than what you're seeing right here. If you go to the people also ask and click on click on one of the questions, they start showing you more. I don't want you to get too far down the rabbit hole because you'll start see a little bit of insight into Google's search algorithm. It's gonna freak you out because you're gonna quickly go from pizza dough to, I don't know, logs or something completely unrelated. If you keep clicking through, it gets weird. so generally around, like, 20 posts like, or whatever we have here. This is as far down as you should probably need to go. If you get to where it start, you know, it's no longer talking about pizza dough, we went too far. And that's just the way the Google algorithm kind of finds things related. and there are things related to pizza dough that somehow won't be pizza. So this is a terrible example. It's early in the morning for me. Alright. so we have these examples right here. Right? How do you store pizza dough for a few hours? How long do you cook pizza dough at 400? Each one of these could be an entire post. Some of them you're gonna see are kind of related. Like, how do you want? You cook pizza dough at 4 25 degrees versus 400. Maybe you could kinda put the 2 of those into one post because they're related. into, like, how long do you put pizza and kinda answer those in individual kind of a faq style, frequently asked questions. There's a lot of different ways to tackle this, but in general, I like to think of each one to be a single post topic when you can. And I know if you're a food blogger, you typically only blog about recipes and you don't do these single kind of post things. I don't care. Every single blogger can do questions and and answer them in their blog post. And you can definitely turn this so it doesn't feel unnatural. Make it work for your site. And most of these topics you can typically write at least 3 to 500 words on. so, basically, what I'd want you to do is put all these down, in some sort of whatever you guys use to stay organized in your lives. I don't care if it's a Google doc or if you have something fun like a signer, Get your stuff in there and know that you're not gonna write these all today. Don't stress out. I'm not gonna ask you to write 20 posts on pizza dough in one day. we would all go mad, but this is gonna be creating kind of like a content calendar for you to do. Alright. So why are we doing this? Alright. So Google already thinks you're an expert, clear on quick pizza dough, and they're telling you this stuff is things that are related to quick pizza dough. If you answer those questions, 1, it's gonna establish who has more of an expert on quick pizza dough. Right? You have so much knowledge about pizza dough now in Google's eyes, but also if you're likely an expert on pizza dough, you're gonna be an expert on all these different pizza dough topics. For whatever reason, Google has deemed you an expert on this, embrace it. Every one of these new posts gives you a chance to rank. you're gonna rank on these new posts a lot easier than you would any other post you go to write. We throw a lot of stuff at the wall as bloggers. Right? We try to write in some stuff. We wanted to break into the top 100 on, and that's disheartening. And in some stuff, you'll break into the top 10. Find the stuff you're ranking to the top 10. Keep going with it. again, because you're gonna keep improving your rankings on all of these different posts. But the most important thing you're doing here with this related content is you're linking back to your cornerstone. So every single one of these posts, is an excuse to link back the quick pizza dough, send that linked equity, and Google loves when you're linking to a post on our related post. Again, they gave you the list of related posts. Alright. So I went back to that example. there's more than just the questions. There's also those little related searches at the bottom, and you saw there was a lot more. Right? There was, different types of pizza dough was shown down there. Okay? So let's do recipes for other types of pizza dough that showed all your other search results below. oh, and another fun one here's an example. that Heather was able to do. She created different pizza recipes that use that pizza though. So think about other terms, and this is ones that you don't even have to get from Google. that could reuse that content, and this applies to everything besides just food. Alright. So back to that whole chart that I've said would come back. Alright. So the supporting post now, those are your related content going back to that chart. So that's travel flats. That's travel boots and slippers down below. that's all trying to improve our ranking on best travel shoes in this example. So back to what you were saying before, your quick pizza, though, would be all of would be that silo up top, your cornerstone, and in every single post you put down below, look at that as they can link to each other, but the most important thing is they link back up to the category page or to the cornerstone or to your quick pizza dough, this is the whole purpose of the exercise. If you forget that link, I I don't you know, you're still gonna get rankings probably on those new terms and maybe it wasn't a complete waste of your time, but always think back to the original goal. It's not just finding new traffic on that topic, improving your ranking on the old. So, you can also always keep going through those related posts to make them linked to the other. It might be tough sometimes to struggle, as I was saying, you wanna have, like, a link per paragraph. The good news is as you write more and more of a simulated post, you're gonna have more stuff to link to. you can go back through those kind of related posts as you write new ones, go back, update the old ones. Again, you can always do a little update section to bring them back up. and always linked here again. say it a million times your cornerstone. Alright, so this sounds terrible, and here's the funny part. You're not just gonna do it for quick pizza dough. You probably are in the top 10 for maybe 10, 20, 30 turns. So I'm gonna recommend you do to keep yourself sane is develop an entire content strategy around this. you're gonna have a lot of different terms that you're going after. It might not just be pizza dough, I think, Heather at the time was also ranking on chicken fillies, like a cheese steak, but with chicken, So, again, we can have so many of these happening at once, develop a bunch of Philly cheesesteak recipes at the same time you're doing a ton of pizza dough and kind of space it out for for your sanity, but also for your readers. Right? A lot of stuff is gonna appear in your feed don't wanna look like you're just a freak that talks about nothing but pizza though for the next several months of your life. you want other content in there. think one of the most important things is just can't be your only content strategy. This is something you're doing on the side. One of the most important things is keep writing original content while you're doing this. So you're gonna have a variety of these little, related post things happening in your in your content calendar but you're also gonna make sure that you have time to write new stuff. It's gonna help you keep your sanity as a writer. Nobody wants to write about the same topic all the time. But more importantly, how else are you gonna find new term that Google thinks you're an expert on? The only way you're gonna get that is from new original content. So this is just a supplement is the way I want you to look at it. And since I know we have more than just food bloggers in the audience and people hate that I obsess about food in all of my examples. It just happened so much from the Mediavine roots. I just wanna show you some examples that you can use this strategy in pretty much any genre. here's a great example of travel. I just did a search for Berlin travel guide. What do you know? Lots of people also ask suddenly, we can do a little 3 day itinerary for Berlin travel. The link back to our travel guide is Berlin in a good city break. I don't know what that means. what to do in Berlin locals, sometimes you're gonna have to take again these phrases and translate them to more coherent English, because a lot of times, I'm sure you do this as sir, when you're searching in Google, I certainly do. You just start slapping words at the end of the sentence as you're thinking about them to narrow them in. Leaders do it also. So what to do in Berlin with your local? That's fine. You can you can change it a little bit on this stuff and Google is smart enough. to kind of relate those keywords. Again, when it comes back to that key phrase, don't always obsess about getting the exact keyword as Google. Get the exact intention. Looks like broken English, certainly not Google, certainly not your readers.

Liz Stapleton [00:34:45]:
Yeah.

Eric Hochberger [00:34:46]:
Is Berlin expensive? Again, all of these, you could see If you write about Berlin, how you're already an expert on it, you can give basically a different version of that post the relevant information. You'll probably have new different information linking back to your travel guide. Really easy to see how Berlin travel guide no longer is just the post, but it is a hub for a whole series of content. And that is what Google is looking for when they're looking for a good search result on something like this. It's a little more, big picture, a little more cornerstone. like, get, become the hub, become the authority on Berlin travel. And, again, this just keeps going, but kindergarten tips for parents, parenting bloggers can use this exact same trick. Again, that people also ask will go on forever. won't go in, in specific example, fashion bloggers, really any lifestyle bloggers. These search results will appear all the time. If you don't get a people also asked when you do your particular search result, try turning your search result into a question. So or, like, how to or why. and then suddenly, can you you can see all the examples here. Get those words in there that make it a question if Google, for some reason, isn't presenting that, though they love to do the people also ask. because for them, it means there's a chance that the reader's gonna stay on Google and not come to your site. Google's goal ultimately is to keep their traffic on their search engine. I know we don't like that. Yeah. But we should should all be thankful for the traffic Google gives us. again, because it is ultimately their traffic. Right? So their goal is to keep it there. so they try to kinda give all these examples for their readers so their readers keep clicking around. So you'll typically see them, but if not, Again, just kinda tweak your your key phrase, until it becomes more of a question. So what to learn in a job interview is obviously like, a question already, so it's definitely gonna get it. and how to is another great example for, like, Craft and DIY bloggers. their content is, like, built for people also ask. it'll literally give you so many results because by nature, most of that stuff is already written as kind of a question in answer with the how to stuff. So, really, this works for anything. Now quickly to go over, Mediavine since we do ads, how do ads fit in with SEO? So I have a a blog post on this as well. You'll hear me keep saying that throughout this thing. but SEO can only only hurt your ads. Sorry. Ads can only hurt your SEO other way around. They can never help your SEO. so what Mediavine does is we do what we can to get out of the way. so if you are running mediavine, It has awesome. We love you. make sure you go into your ad settings and turn on optimized ads for page speed on both desktop and mobile. What that's gonna do is it's gonna get all of your ads out of that first screen view, make your site load lightning fast. Google hates ads in the first screen view. In general, they wanna see content there. unfortunately, kind of traditional methods of advertising was all about called ATF or above the fold, and ads were considered more valuable in the first screen view. So historically, a lot of ad management companies love to load up your site with ads in the first screen view, Google and users don't like that experience. It's your first presentation to your user. don't put a lot of ads there. so using the feature will automatically remove them. If you had any of them with Mediavine, we don't typically do those. everything we do at Mediavine follows what's called the Coalition for better ad standards. so make sure if your ad provider is not named mediavine, that they're following is kind of CBA guidelines. That's what Google uses to determine how much, basically, how much the ads are impacting the user experience As long as you're following those standards, who will be okay with your site, and Mediavine settings will never let you kind of violate the CBA guidelines. Another fun fact about Mediavine, we have an SEO optimized video player. So if you are with mediavine, use the video player. it doesn't just make you a lot of money. It's optimized for SEO. the video player outputs what's called schema dot org, or JSON LD. So you can actually appear in Google video search results. So Google has carousels and little interludes throughout their search results, and those are kinda like only if you're you're only eligible if, let's say, your recipe and a recipe carousel or they have video carousels, if you do video, Mediavine video player will turn that post into a video post eligible for all new places for you to rank. so if you're doing video, use this, YouTube itself doesn't even output that stuff by default for you, but the Mediavine video player will. And if you're not with us yet, we'd love for you to be. If you've had at least 25,000 sessions in the last 30 days according to Google Analytics, apply at Mediavine, some other fun SEO stuff that mediavine has that people may not know about. so we also create WordPress plugins, that are built with SEO in mind, including create. And this allows you to basically take your content and present it in templated way for users. food bloggers are very familiar with these as recipe cards, right, recipe cards at the bottom of food blog or Now how two cards at the bottom for kinda like craft bloggers. Those are marked up in steema that, as I was saying before, they make you eligible for results such as the recipe carousel, or the new how to markup on mobile, it gets you a lot more screen real estate in the Google search results. It won't necessarily improve your rankings but it will improve your clicks. And at the end of the day, all that matters, did people click to your site? so this is gonna be a huge SEO boost to use to create, and it's not just for food bloggers, not just for craft and how to. We have things called lists, new things called coming out called indexes, where create can be used by all different types of bloggers. try it out. Everything is optimized for page speed, optimized for SEO, user experience, and they're pretty darn beautiful. So if you're not running create, consider it whether you really what any anything you've logged out. Okay. This is something we've been talking about for over a year. I'm not sure if people are familiar with trellis, but is our WordPress theme framework we're developing with? A lot of people run, like, Genesis based themes. You can think of trellis as a replacement for Genesis, but also it's your built in speed optimization plugin. Perhaps you've heard speed matters quite a bit for SEO these days, and trellis is built with that in mind. so you're not gonna need to run 8,000,000 different optimization plugins, like your lazy loading and your image compression and everything that optimizes your JavaScript and all the stuff you probably have installed over the years to speed up your site. Mhmm. Trellis kinda demolishes all that. builds from the ground up a super fast lightweight theme that has all that stuff built in. Mediavine will also be releasing child themes in addition to custom built themes by developers. Mediavine child themes will obviously be adoptimized and built for page speed. child themes will be priced very reasonably in the media line marketplace. We're excited, beta testing is beginning on this in February. so, hopefully, if you haven't signed up for the beta should be reaching out to you guys soon. So, Charles, is really happening, and it should hopefully change page speed for everyone. Our goal is 99 with running Mediavine Create, Treliss, ads, and [inaudible].

Liz Stapleton [00:42:05]:
Yes. Feel like most people are most familiar with this one.

Eric Hochberger [00:42:09]:
Yeah. funny enough, a lot of you guys are already running it because we acquired social pug. Yeah. And social pug. got a very big boost after, a little social warfare debacle earlier this year and a couple other plugins that got hacked. we love social pug, and we want to make it the best social sharing tools that are out there. right now, the plans we're optimizing for page speed because that's what we're obsessed with. social sharing tools in general, slow down sites, more than you would realize. Every little piece of JavaScript, you add to your site to power your Pinterest counts or your Facebook counts are slowing down your site. Social pug in an awesome job and that kind of behind the scenes, it talks to Facebook, gets your account, talks of interest, gets your account. So it already does a lot of the page feed stuff right. It's further optimizing it. So if you are running grow and you have the paid version, Go into your settings and turn on the optimize for page speed mode. it'll already speed up your site today, and we're working on adding more and more features speed up grow even more, so it has no impact on your page speed. So you can have it all. Social sharing end speed. And then finally, we're gonna be adding opt in So a lot of people right now run kind of what's called 3rd party JavaScript are basically They they rely on something like an opt in monster when you call opt in monster and it bodes kind of like the opt ins. Those are incredibly slow. one of the things we're focusing on with Grow is gonna be doing, again, the same way that social pug did it where everything's hosted locally and fast. We wanna do the same thing for your opt ins. So we believe opt ins can be fast too. That's coming soon. Final thing, if you enjoyed this talk, and you wanna hear more me rambling, come join us in Baltimore. great chance to network in person with a lot of your bloggers, and continuing a lot of the topics you're learning here, at the Mediavine conference in Baltimore. Plus, it's a lot of fun. we have a 10% off coupon breakthrough 10 for anyone listening. So I don't know.

Liz Stapleton [00:44:10]:
No. That's, thank you. yeah, I guess, I mean, I love virtual summits. I love, you know, all the knowledge you get to gain, and we do have a Facebook group that helps you kinda get to know other people, but in person summit or in person conferences, Like, that's how I actually met a lot of the speakers or, you know, people I connected with that connecting me to other people for speakers for this summit, and, you know, I've found a lot of really great sort of blogging friends because a lot of times when you're a blogger and like your family doesn't get it, so So, yeah, and, you know, I'm I'm a big fan of in person conferences as well. so so thank you for that discount code for attendees. That's that's awesome. any final words or anything else? That was a great session. I know a lot. I learned some things. I was taking notes. So thank you. But any any final words of advice or anybody?

Eric Hochberger [00:45:01]:
No. I think just honestly that mantra that mantra of, like, zoom out, don't stress SEO is not as hard as you think it is. you don't have to hire someone to do an audit on your site is literally just developing a good content strategy and remembering these basic principles. Google has this awesome thing called the starter guide, Google SEO starter guide, you know, some, like, webmaster blog They try as much as they can to interact with us and tell us what to do. We all like to ignore them and go to experts. Don't listen to Google. I have a little series SEO, like a CEO that the name of this title is gonna be my SEO series on the Mediavine blog and YouTube channel, kinda be breaking down a lot of these topics and easy to digest formats, but in general, I'm just taking what Google tells us and telling it to you guys. You can do it yourself. Listen to me. gladly talk to you guys for a thousand words in article

Liz Stapleton [00:45:52]:
--

Eric Hochberger [00:45:52]:
Yeah. -- stock SEL.

Liz Stapleton [00:45:54]:
Alright. Well, awesome. Thank you so much for your time. Really appreciate it. And, hopefully, everyone else got as much out of this as I did. So thank you.

Eric Hochberger [00:46:03]:
No. Thank you. Alright.

[00:00:12.460] - Gina
Hi, everyone. I am so excited to be part of Liz's Blogger Breakthrough Summit this year. I've been an attendee for the past few, and I feel like it's one of the best-organized and best-run online summits out there, especially since we've had to pivot to everything being online. Hi. My name is Gina Lincicum.

[00:00:30.760] - Gina
I'm from Connect and Learn blogging community, and today we're talking about the secrets of PLR. Now, before we get started, I would love for you to take a second and go in the chat box and let me know if you've ever heard of the term PLR, because as I go around teaching about it, I find more and more people have no idea what it is. But don't worry, you'll know what it is before you're done with our session today. So, let me go ahead and get my slides going here and we'll get started. All right, so like I said, my name is Gina.

[00:01:03.850] - Gina
I'm from Connect and Learn blogging community. I'm actually part of a partnership. My partner, Michelle Borocious and I have been coaching, and we were holding retreats for a while in person before everything happened, and now we do everything online just like everybody else. So, we've both been blogging for a very long time. We consider ourselves blogging dinosaurs.

[00:01:26.590] - Gina
We started back in, I think, 2008, 2009. We've been through all of the changes. We both make fulltime incomes from our blogs. We both have multiple blogs, and then we do other things. We also run teams.

[00:01:41.110] - Gina
So, when we talk about what the secrets are, that's what we're trying to get you to see, is how you can level up and make more money, put out more content, which will help you make more money. This is one of our secrets of how we do it. We both used PLR in our own businesses over the years, and we are so excited to teach you how to use it because we think it's really going to help you work smarter, not harder. All right, so before we get started, you might want to take a deep breath, give yourself a stretch. You might want to grab some tea or beverage.

[00:02:16.050] - Gina
You can always hit pause if you're watching the replay. This is a short class. You might want to take a couple of notes, but we do have a worksheet for you when we're done. And as Liz always says, go ahead and turn off your phone or flip it over, close those other tabs. It's a short class.

[00:02:32.440] - Gina
I really want you to get the most out of it. All right, so let's get started. After this class, I've got three goals for you, basically, I want you to know what the three types of done-for-you content are. So, you're creating content right now in your business and for your blog.

[00:02:47.740] - Gina
And you might not know that there's done-for-you content out there that you can purchase and use just the way it is. That's news to a lot of people. We're going to talk about that. Then we're going to focus in on one of those three, which is PLR, and I want to make sure you understand what it is when you're doing this session. Last, we'll talk about how to adapt it and use it in your business.

[00:03:10.410] - Gina
All right? The whole point here is for you to create more content, so you can earn more money. So, let's get started.

[00:03:20.210] - Gina
All right. First, we're going to talk about done-for-you content. One of the things we find as we're teaching about this is a lot of bloggers don't realize that the big guys out there, the big bloggers making big bucks, are not working alone. First of all, they probably have a team, but they're also purchasing some content. It's not possible for a single person to run a giant empire and be publishing every single day and making all kinds of money. It takes a lot.

[00:03:49.240] - Gina
And so, what a lot of people do is purchase content. Now, I guess I'm like a medium person. I purchase content too. So, there's other reasons to purchase content. You can have it published faster, obviously, if it's already done.

[00:04:02.770] - Gina
Let's say I want to write one article a week and purchase four. Well, then I could publish five articles a week, and that would be great for my site. The other reason that I do it personally is I've been blogging for almost 15 years. I am really tired of some of the things I do. I used to do recipes.

[00:04:20.100] - Gina
I had little kids. I would have to keep everybody's little paws off the food, make sure the lighting was perfect. Nobody could eat dinner till I was done taking pictures and making sure everything looked good. Then Pinterest came out and everybody's photography went up a couple of notches. Not mine.

[00:04:36.880] - Gina
I decided to outsource my recipes. So, now I purchase all those photos already done for me and the recipe, and all I have to do is write the blog post around it. So, for me, it doesn't just save time of having to go to the store, get the ingredients, make the food, photograph the food, edit the photographs, and all of that. It just shows up in my email and I take it and use it. And the blog post goes up relatively quickly.

[00:05:04.810] - Gina
So that's one of the reasons I do it. Another good reason to buy content would be if your audience and you have a mismatch. What I mean is, I know a lot of people who started blogs when their kids were little, maybe your blog is about preschool activities, you know, arts and crafts activities. Well, now it's 15 years later and your kids are in college and you don't have any little hands around the house to take pictures of doing projects.

[00:05:27.720] - Gina
Why don't you hire someone or buy some of this done-for-you content from someone that does have little kids who is doing these projects for somebody who's currently doing preschool and they know what is current with all the trends in preschool learning. You can own a blog that has an audience that is very different than who you are. That's totally fine. You might want to consider some done for you content. All right?

[00:05:52.200] - Gina
So, there's three types of done-for-you content. Let me show you some examples. So, first of all, I keep mentioning the recipes. There's something called exclusive content. Exclusive content is when you buy something and you're the only one who has it.

[00:06:10.170] - Gina
So, someone writes an article for you because you ask them to write an article, you know Ten Ways Busy Moms Can Do Selfcare. They write the article for you. It's bespoke, and you're the only person who has it that's exclusive. Now, that tends to be expensive, especially if it's things with photographs like crafts and recipes, like this one, right? If I was the only person to get this soup recipe, this would cost a certain amount of money.

[00:06:38.040] - Gina
And I will share some places where you can see what the prices are like, they're all over the place because that's how the market works. But just remember, you're the only person who has it. So, you can use it the way it is, but it will cost you. I like to purchase the type of content that's called semi-exclusive content. Now, semi-exclusive content tends to go out to three, four, five, or six people total.

[00:07:02.400] - Gina
So, for example, I purchased this particular soup, this 15 bean soup, from someone who was selling five copies of this recipe. So, there are five bloggers who have this particular recipe that we bought from the same person. All right. The good news is it's semi-exclusive, which means there's not a hundred of them out there. There's just these five. We have different photos for the finished products.

[00:07:27.220] - Gina
And here I have made a pin out of this one. I have got the one that has the white bowls. I've got the white towel with the painted background and the cutting board. So, the person who does my recipes, when she sells to five people, she does five different photo shoots for the finished food. So, everybody's will look different.

[00:07:49.440] - Gina
So, if you go and you find the other person, I don't even know who it is, the other four people who bought this recipe, it's not going to look the same as mine because the photos will be different. Now, the one thing that is usually the same is the ingredients shot. So, all five of us have this ingredients shot. You can use it or not use it, that's up to you. She also tends to share the process photos because you're obviously only making the recipe the one time.

[00:08:15.150] - Gina
So, there's not really a good way to do five separate ways. So, I tend to use my process photos in my slideshow videos and in idea pins. I don't tend to put those in my article. So, again, down here is another example of a finished photo that nobody else has. I have this one with a striped towel looking at it from the top.

[00:08:36.160] - Gina
The other thing you can do is take these photos just like you would with stock photos and do some editing. You can crop them however you'd like, you can turn them into pins, you can do collage. There's all kinds of things you can do with Canva, Pick monkey, whatever your editing system is for your photos. Alright? And the other thing I bought along with these beautiful finished photos is the actual recipe.

[00:08:58.770] - Gina
So, here's the recipe, it's in my recipe card. And then I think I have another pin. Here we go. I've got another pin down here where I put in one of the process images and then a finished image. All right, so that's a good example of semi-exclusive content.

[00:09:14.520] - Gina
The other kinds of semi-exclusive content that I've seen a lot of recently are graphics like hand puppets for little kids or craft like a wreath for a holiday, right? It's really nice if you are not a crafty person that you can publish that type of content just by purchasing it from somebody who is really good at it. And you don't have to be good at all the things, you don't have to be good at photography and be good at making the craft and be good at editing the photos and the writing. All right? You can just pick the part that you like to do, you can pick the part that you're good at and you can outsource the rest.

[00:09:51.520] - Gina
Alright? When you are looking at making more money with your business, you want to be working less time. And that's one of the ways you'll do it is with that kind of outsourcing. All right, let's go back to our slides. So, I shared all three kinds.

[00:10:04.690] - Gina
Exclusive, remember, is the most expensive because you're the only person who has it. The other kind of exclusive content that you may see are things like listicles. I've seen virtual assistants selling things like 20 great Valentine's Day gifts for moms. You're the only person who gets that. So, you can go ahead and use that just the way it is.

[00:10:26.850] - Gina
If you get semi-exclusive content, you will want to change it up a little bit like I showed you with the recipe. And then last but not least, we have PLR, the thing we're here for today. It stands for private label rights and we're going to dive into that in just a second. Before we do that, could you please go in the chat box and let me know how would using done-for-you content help you? I would love to know.

[00:10:57.010] - Gina
Thank you so much. All right, let's dig into PLR. So, what is it? Let's start with the word rights. Private label rights just means that the seller gets to determine how the buyer uses their products, right?

[00:11:12.450] - Gina
So, if I sell you a recipe and a bunch of photos, I get to tell you what you can do with it. Now, in my case, when I sell PLR, I say you can do anything you want with it except sell it again as PLR. So, you couldn't buy something from my PLR store and then go sell it to 500 people. It's the only thing you can't do. But you can take it, put your own name on it.

[00:11:35.900] - Gina
You can put it into an ebook. You can use it as a blog post. You can use it in your email newsletters. You could use it for a challenge that you do with your followers. You could chop it up and turn it into social media posts.

[00:11:48.260] - Gina
There's a lot of things that you can do with this PLR content that's already done for you. I typically see articles that are PLR, but we are starting to see more and more recipes, crafts, things like that that really do take people a lot of time. PLR doesn't cost as much as semi-exclusive and exclusive content. That's what's so great about it. We're talking like under $10.

[00:12:13.500] - Gina
We sell PLR articles for 3 to $4. Think about the amount of time that saves you. You get a 750 word article ready to go for 3 or $4. It's also a great way if you're not an expert on something. So, you're not an expert on camping, but you need some camping articles for your blog because your readers are asking for them.

[00:12:34.710] - Gina
You can purchase those. All right, so where to find it? I'm going to share lots and lots of ways at the end of where to find PLR. But just so you know, if you Google PLR, you're going to find tons and tons of old stuff. PLR has been around for a very long time.

[00:12:49.950] - Gina
So, just remember, the big difference for PLR is the price, which is really low, and the exclusivity, which is you know as many as they can sell, typically. That's the downside in a way. And we're going to talk in the next section about what to do about that, so it's not a downside.

[00:13:09.460] - Gina
Here's my favorite metaphor for teaching people about PLR. So, let's say you go to the store and you buy a white T-shirt. Now you probably pulled it off the rack and there were probably 20 other of that same T-shirt on the rack, right? Well, you're going to buy that T-shirt. You can take it home and you can wear it.

[00:13:25.620] - Gina
And it's fine. It's totally functional. It's maybe a little boring, whatever. Maybe that's your style. Cool.

[00:13:32.130] - Gina
But like this arrow here, you're going to add a little bit of you. Maybe at work you want to throw on like a classic blazer and some trousers. And you're going to dress it up and it's going to work in a professional setting. Maybe you're going to throw on a denim vest and some funky pants, and you're going to go out with your friends to brunch. Or maybe it's going to go under a cardigan with a scarf, you kow.

[00:13:54.110] - Gina
It's just going to be like your teacher look for today. Whatever your personal style is, you're going to add it to the white T-shirt. So that means that even though there are those 20 T-shirts and how many stores are selling white T-shirts out there, right? There's thousands of people out there wearing white T-shirts today, but you wouldn't know that they're all the same white T-shirt because of the presentation, because everybody's adding their own style and flair. And that's what you're going to do with PLR to make it your own.

[00:14:22.960] - Gina
Here's our PLR store. Just want to give you some examples. This happens to be our home category, and let me talk to you about spinning it for your own style. So, let's say you want to purchase pantry organizing tips. This is an article that would work for lots of different niches.

[00:14:39.570] - Gina
So, if you were a minimalist, you might add in some information about how to keep your pantry organizing minimal. You don't want to be overflowing. You don't want it to be disorganized. You might even put in a principle or something like that. But if you're a blogger who deals with preppers, you're going to have a completely different take on this.

[00:15:00.240] - Gina
And you're going to be talking about shelving, and you're going to have your affiliate links in there for all of the things that you can buy to hold your cans and all of that kind of thing, right? And then if you're a food blog, you might use this in a different way also. So, depending on where your niche is, it could be very different. Let me give you another example. The storage tips for small bedrooms.

[00:15:22.460] - Gina
If you blog for older people, maybe empty nesters who are downsizing their home, you're going to come at this with a slightly different angle than somebody who runs a blog for college kids who decorate their dorm room, right? Those are very small bedrooms. They can use the same information that's in this article. You're just gonna gear it differently for your audience. So that part is really important.

[00:15:48.310] - Gina
Anytime you buy PLR, you don't want to use it the way it is. You can technically use it the way it is, but we really recommend that you don't do that because then it's like that white T-shirt. It's boring and plain in it, and you're going to find it somewhere else on the Internet. All right? So, in step three here, we're going to talk about all the ways that you can change up PLR. And when you download the worksheet when you're done here, we have all the steps on there for you as well.

[00:16:14.430] - Gina
Right? Before we hop into the next section. We could just take a second, if you could hop over to that chat box and let me know what's your content niche. When I do this presentation live, it's really fun to take somebody's niche right there who's in the audience and figure out how to spin some of the PLR that we're using for examples.

[00:16:32.310] - Gina
I'm going to do the best I can just with the examples that I have. I am going to be here in the chat with you while you're watching this live, and I'm also in the Facebook group if you end up having questions or you're trying to figure out how to make PLR work for your niche. All right. So, let's head into this next section. This is really the most important thing. So, once you get that white T-shirt, once you buy that piece of PLR, what are you going to do with it?

[00:16:56.130] - Gina
There's so many things you can do with it. It's not just blog posts, okay? Once you buy a piece of PLR, it is yours. You own it. Let's say you bought it from me.

[00:17:05.160] - Gina
It's not going to have my name on it. You don't put my name as the author. You put your name as the author. You are going to use it however you'd like. You can chop it up, let's say it's ten ways to reorganize your pantry.

[00:17:18.740] - Gina
You could make that into a ten day email challenge, and you could take each paragraph and send one every day to your followers, so that they canva complete this challenge. Or you could take those ten steps and turn it into a digital product, like a worksheet or an ebook that you can sell. You can totally do that with PLR. You can also use it for a full blog post. Obviously, one of the best ways to use PLR is for comparison and reviews.

[00:17:45.840] - Gina
In order for your articles to be found on Google, you know, they need to have a great word count. We start our articles at 750. We're aiming for you to add enough to get them to a thousand. Some people like their stuff even longer, so you can buy PLR to help bulk up with quality, some of your blog posts that you have. You can take parts of PLR, break it up, and do those cute little images that people put up on Instagram, you know, with the quotes.

[00:18:11.000] - Gina
You can use them for Facebook shares. You can use them for video scripts or podcast outlines. I've even seen people purchase PLR because they blog in another language, and so they take the English version, and then they just translate it, and it becomes a new blog post for them. It's also a really easy way to get optins, so not the text so much, but you can purchase PLR that's printable, like I said, like checklists, like a budget checklist or a 2023 calendar or something like that. There's a lot of PLR out there, okay?

[00:18:43.620] - Gina
There's videos, there's lots and lots of text articles. There are all kinds of things that you can purchase. So, let's go ahead and show you an example. I'm going to go back here to our store and we're going to pick on this article over here the Ten Best Accessories for Your Instant Pot. This happens to be our best seller, so I thought I would use it as an example of how you can adapt and use this.

[00:19:08.610] - Gina
So, here we go. I am in a Google Doc just to make it easier. Obviously, you canva do this in WordPress if that's how you're doing it. So this is what it looks like when you get it. It is just an article.

[00:19:20.010] - Gina
It's got the ten things here, the steamer basket, the silicone tipped tongs, so obviously, the first thing that you want to do is put your affiliate links in here. Listicles are a fabulous way to use PLR because you get your intro paragraph. You've got your descriptions right here. It saves you so much time.

[00:19:39.410] - Gina
You just go in here and whoever you're selling for, you put your affiliate links in there. Don't forget to add your disclosure. I like to throw that in there too. So that's one of the main things you can do to add to this PLR. Another thing that's super easy to do is change the number.

[00:19:54.950] - Gina
Maybe you read through here and you disagree with some of them. You could knock this down to seven accessories. Maybe you're that minimalist blogger I mentioned before. Maybe you're going to say you really only need three. But here's ten.

[00:20:06.840] - Gina
The other thing you can do is double it. Maybe you have other accessories that you recommend. You're going to go ahead and follow this structure, find your accessories that you like, and go ahead and put your one or two sentence description and you're going to change this to 20 best accessories. That's a really easy way to change it. While we're up here at the title, let's talk about keywords.

[00:20:28.830] - Gina
So, the first thing you'll want to do when you buy the PLR is figure out what your keywords are going to be because you're going to want to change this title. If everybody buys this and publishes it as Ten Best Accessories for Your Instant Pot, then there's a whole bunch of those out there. Now, that's not the end of the world. I mean, think about how many chocolate chip cookie recipes are out on the internet, for goodness sake. And they're all called chocolate chip cookie recipes.

[00:20:52.580] - Gina
But let's say you are a, like I said, a minimalist blogger. You're going to be coming at this article from a different point of view than somebody who is like my audience, which is super busy moms that just need to get dinner on the table. So, maybe our instant pot focus is going to be like dump it in and go. So, it's funny because for me, I would probably write more about the accessories that just make things go faster for you. Like I don't know that I think it's on here, the.

[00:21:23.430] - Gina
Oh, yeah, the cheesecake pan. I know there's tons of food bloggers that do lots of recipes about how to make cheesecake in your instant pot. That doesn't work for my audience. That is just too much trouble and it's too fancy. I would take that off this list because it just doesn't fit my particular audience.

[00:21:40.360] - Gina
And then that would knock this down to nine. So that's a change. Whatever your keywords are, if mine is going to be the most, now I'm having trouble thinking of it, the most necessary instant pot accessories. Or this could be a gift guide for people who love their instant pot, you know those people that are out there, right?

[00:22:02.340] - Gina
You want to figure out what your keywords are and you want to make sure you put your keywords in this opening paragraph. That's the main way that Google will not consider this duplicate content with somebody else who happens to buy and publish this article. What I tend to do personally is just get rid of the whole intro because I don't want to use it and I write my own IN my own voice. And that way I know that Google will not see this as duplicate content. Alright, so another thing that you can do in something like this, that's a listicle that's really easy, is just move the paragraphs around.

[00:22:33.470] - Gina
Why don't you you know put them in order of what you think is the most important. Or you could put them in order of what they cost. That would be another option. You put them in alphabetical order. This article doesn't happen to have any H2s, which are really important for your SEO.

[00:22:49.520] - Gina
So that would be another thing that you can do. Maybe down here, I can do. Let's see my top accessories and I'm going to make this in H2. You know how it works in WordPress, right? Then over here, I'm going to put in my affiliate link.

[00:23:10.290] - Gina
That's going to make it be underlined. All right. And I can read through this and just briefly see if it sounds like me. This really doesn't take very long. I can just scan through here and see if there's anything I want to add.

[00:23:24.360] - Gina
The main thing I would suggest when you're adding to PLR is put some personal experience in there. So, if I've used, which I have, I've used silicone tipped tongs. It's the only way my kids will use the instant pot because it's so darn hot. So, I might throw a line in there about that why I think that's a really important thing that you have because it's the easiest way to get your hardboiled eggs out of there, right? Another way to make this very much your own is to add some images.

[00:23:52.950] - Gina
So, maybe since I do have silicone tipped tongs at home. I will take a picture of my own with my own instant pot and throw that picture in here. Even if you end up using stock images with your PLR, there's lots of ways that you can edit the stock images, which now that I think about it, they're just like PLR, right? They go out to the masses, they're all over the internet. But there are ways that you can edit those stock images to look different than other people's.

[00:24:17.030] - Gina
Alright. So, another thing that you want to do is, like I said, add the word count. If there's not a conclusion, oh, here's a conclusion paragraph. You want to add things like related articles. Let's see, I would probably do something like my top five instant pot recipes.

[00:24:36.740] - Gina
This would be another H2, because you want to make sure that you're linking to your other content, right? This is already going to make it different than somebody else's. And now I'm going to go ahead and put in my recipes that are on my blog that are like the easiest ones. I'm going to put those right here and link to those. So, not only are you adding text and bulking up your article for SEO, you're also interlinking to related topics on your blog, which is also really good for SEO.

[00:25:04.940] - Gina
And then don't forget about external links. So, typically, I would do that. Let's say it's a recipe. I might put it somewhere else I might talk about. Let's see, let me look through here.

[00:25:16.610] - Gina
I've got a friend who does only instant pot on her blog and maybe she, let's see, where's a good one.

[00:25:28.140] - Gina
Like I don't have a tempered glass lid. So, if she's got a recipe that shows the lid, then it might be a really good place to link to one of her. This versatile lid has three great uses and then it's for slow cooking like this beef stew. And I can link out to her. So that's a great way to do it.

[00:25:49.360] - Gina
I said I would get rid of this one. You can get rid of paragraphs. We are going to give you a worksheet that has all these tips. I just wanted to share that it doesn't take too much time, especially once you get in the hang of it, when you're buying PLR. Don't forget to add your images.

[00:26:05.270] - Gina
Let's see, you can again, this is if it's a blog post, this doesn't have to be a blog post. You could purchase this and you could put some of these into an email that you send out when people are cooking for the holidays. And you're going to say, hey, you need these top three things and you can just cut and paste these right into your email. These would also be great little shares on social media. Like you could put that in a Facebook post or in your Facebook group and go ahead and put your affiliate link.

[00:26:38.130] - Gina
You could also take this whole thing and make it an outline for you to do a short form video on Instagram or TikTok, reels, YouTube, whatever it is. You know, on YouTube, you can put all of your links underneath. You could link all ten of these items and you could just talk through this article. This gives it to you.

[00:26:57.260] - Gina
You don't have to think too hard. You can just show pictures like slides or whatever it is you do for your YouTube videos. We've given you the script right here. Alright? So that's another way to use it.

[00:27:09.180] - Gina
Let me make sure I've covered all the things here. I tend to focus on how to use them as blog posts because that's how I tend to use them to save me the most time. But there are obviously lots of other ways. All right. Let's go back here.

[00:27:23.790] - Gina
All right. We highly suggest that you don't use PLR the way it is. And that's because somebody will, I guarantee it. Somebody will cut and paste it exactly the way it is. And you don't want to have duplicate content like them.

[00:27:38.670] - Gina
So, we're sharing our system for easily adapting the PLR and that's what we consider our secrets. Our worksheet is going to have the ten things that you absolutely need to change to make it your own. Once you get the hang of it, it really doesn't take that long and you can get really good at taking these three and four dollar articles and turning them into ready to go blog posts. Alright. So, now that you know about done-for-you content and you know a little more about PLR, here's what you can do next. Look ahead on your content calendar.

[00:28:11.340] - Gina
It's the beginning of the year still. You're looking ahead at what you're going to be publishing and what type of PLR would help you. Are you going to be looking for blog posts? Are you looking to beef up your email newsletters this year? Are you looking to put out a digital product in the next couple of months?

[00:28:27.750] - Gina
Do you need more graphics? Do you need printables? What are the different things that you need as you look at your content calendar for the year? Try to identify what kind of thing you're looking for, so then you can search for that relevant quality PLR. The worksheet that we give you has over twelve fabulous places where you can get high-quality PLR that we recommend.

[00:28:47.660] - Gina
Obviously, we will be on that list too. And then the last, you're going to take that worksheet and adapt the piece of content to work for your niche, your audience, and your voice. So, remember, even though multiple people can buy that same done-for-you content, it comes out as a different result. All right, I am here for questions. I am also in the Facebook group and in the chat.

[00:29:09.840] - Gina
If you're watching this live, if you are watching the replay, I hope you'll come over to the Facebook Group. You're going to get our worksheet. If you sign up for our emails that give you the top tips for using PLR, what we think you should always change, we are always happy to help. We've got our email at the bottom of that worksheet. If you feel really stuck because you can't figure out what kind of PLR would work for your niche and your audience, we would love to help you.

[00:29:33.870] - Gina
You can just send us an email or contact us in the Facebook Group. All right. The other thing that you get as a special bonus from us is when you download the worksheet, you'll get a code for a free piece of PLR content from our shop, the shortcut PLR Content Shop. Michelle and I made this because we wanted lifestyle bloggers like us to have access to very high-quality, done-for-you content they could use on their blogs. Everything that we have runs between 3 and $7.

[00:30:03.900] - Gina
You're going to pick one thing for free. Again, if you don't have any idea which one would work for you, we would be happy to make some suggestions. Plus, we're going to give you lots and lots of links to other people that we know are selling high-quality PLR. It's the same kind of thing. It's recipes, crafts, printables, all kinds of text articles.

[00:30:24.920] - Gina
You will find blog articles if you're a travel blogger, a parenting blogger, pet blogger. There's something for everybody. Everybody sells slightly different things. We will help you find what you need.

[00:30:37.190] - Gina
We really will. Thank you so much for being here. I am really excited to help you learn how to use PLR and I hope everybody will sign up for our email, so you'll find out when we have new PLR. And I'm really excited to see you in the Facebook Group. Thanks so much for being here.

[00:00:12.990] - Heather
Well, hello and welcome to Easy Content Planning Tips to plan a year's worth of content quickly. My name is Heather Ritchie and I am a certified content marketing strategist, SEO content writer and blogger over at Writer's Life for You. And my whole goal is to help women who want to work from home for a better work life balance, so they can spend more time with their family and friends. Like that's my main objective with everything that I do. And content marketing is one of the best ways that you can make money with your content. So, it's super important to make sure that you actually have a content plan, which I know can be easier said than done when we all have all those things to do in our business, especially if you don't have a team.

[00:00:58.780] - Heather
So, I'm going to give you some quick tips and you'll just see how amazing it will be to be able to plan your content much quickly. So, let's dive into the lesson.

[00:01:10.840] - Heather
All right, guys. We are going to dive into the presentation now. Easy Content Planning Tips to plan a year's worth of content very quickly. We're going to get started here. Of course, you met me just a little bit ago. I'm Heather, and in case this is your first time meeting me, I am a certified content marketing strategist, SEO content writer, and the blogger behind Writers Life for You. I basically help freelancers and other solopreneurs start and grow successful online businesses. And I also write SEO-optimized content for bloggers and small businesses. So, this is what you're going to learn. You're going to learn why having a content plan is so important and basically why you should care about it. I'm also going to give you some smart content planning tips and you're going to learn the things you need to do to create a content strategy and plan to actually execute it. So before we jump into this, I do want to tell you that I basically have a framework. It's a three part framework that I call ACC for your content planning process. So it starts with getting to know your audience and then we go on to creating your content strategy.

[00:02:27.900] - Heather
And then the final stage is creating your content plan. So here's why you should care about content planning. Content planning allows you to plan ahead. Which may seem kind of simple. But really I see a lot of people that struggle with this because I remember being in the spot where there's so much to do as a blogger or solopreneur. And the tasks just keep piling up and you know you need blog articles and you know, you need to promote them and you know you need other social media content and other types of content, and it just gets overwhelming. So, something has to give. So I found myself, I knew, especially with affiliate marketing and things like, you know, bundles, that I was a part of like ultimate bundle genius blogger toolkit or the writers toolkit. I knew that I needed to get content out there which really means, when it comes to affiliate marketing, especially, it means your email marketing and then your social media marketing. And so, I found myself hurrying through like, okay. I know I have to get all these posts up and I know I need to write all these emails but I was so rushed that I wasn't taking the time to really sit and think what will connect with my audience and then the messaging was probably falling flat because I wasn't taking the time to really think about what I was saying.

[00:03:55.320] - Heather
I was just trying to get it out there because I knew I had to get it done. So content planning was a lifesaver for me because allows me to plan ahead and then I can spend more time on that messaging because you really need to connect with people to make more money. When you're selling products, services, courses, printables, whatever, you really want to connect with your audience's pain points to make money. So, with the planning, it allows you to be efficient and develop a content plan that allows you to focus on creating and promoting your content versus sitting there wasting time just trying to figure out what to write even. It also allows you to focus on messaging, which I just mentioned and create content based on the product, service, courses and even affiliate products that you promote. Creating content centered around your promotions set you up as an expert with a helpful solution and that works whether it's your own problems or you're like hey, there's this product I use all the time, I think you should go get it. So, it also helps you avoid common content mistakes and I'm sure that we are all guilty of committing some of these content mistakes but for instance, having a content plan ensures that your content is relevant to your audience and it's unique.

[00:05:09.330] - Heather
You want to stand out from everybody else, you know pick those polarizing topics that will set you apart. Like I just described what my framework is do any of your solutions like any of your products, printables, printables can be a quick win and that's very helpful too. Or any of your courses and products, do you set yourself apart? So that you're unique and your solution is the one they need. It also allows you to optimize each piece of content for better engagement. So, once I got more organized with my business in general, I wasn't whipping through hashtags on Instagram quick, I had sets of hashtags that I could use that would just easier to copy and paste, which is really helpful because I've been in a bunch of real challenges where I've now done a real almost every day for, I think it's been over a month now. So, a lot of content creation, that's considered content creation too. Also, a documented content creation process and workflow allows you to maximize efficiency. So, once you have a system and like a workflow, and you do that same process over and over again, it allows you to be much more efficient.

[00:06:17.890] - Heather
And then with a content calendar, you can stay on top of all those tasks and timelines and make sure your content is published on time. And Trello is my goto. You're probably going to talk about it more, but I love Trello, and I didn't used to. I was one of those people that wanted to like it, but didn't until I had a really complicated launch and it was like a lifesaver. So, what I like about Trello content planning is I have one place to go for all the tasks. Like, I have a master task board in Trello, and I keep adding to it and adding to it, and I switch, I use labels to see which are important, which are urgent. And it allows me to also create a plan where I pick a main promotion every month, and then my content for the month centers around that promotion. Or if I know I have a course release in May, you know, say, for my Content Planning 101, I'm going to talk about content planning and set myself up as an expert in my niche. And so, it really, really, really helps you stay on top of all this tasks, and it also helps you identify your audience's pain points to ensure that all your content marketing is successful.

[00:07:30.550] - Heather
It's like I keep saying, you know get to know your audience intimately. You almost want to be like a stalker in a good way. You know what keeps them up at night? What are they worried about? What do they need right now? Or what is one thing or one problem that you could fix that would make their life easier? And then planning also helps maintain engagement. The process doesn't end once you hit publish, a good content plan factor than following up to get more engagement. And so, I've been trying to do this, which is why I've been in these real challenges that's on top of my content planning, I'm trying to drill down and learn what I need to do on Instagram to connect with more people and help more people. And that includes going and commenting with other people's you know reels and posts and liking them, and following up with people, commenting on my reels and things like that. So, you really do want to set aside some time to kind of just run in and reply to comments and things like that. And you can do it once a day for like ten minutes or less. Sometimes, I do it during my relaxing time.

[00:08:33.960] - Heather
I'm a night owl, so I don't stop work till like 10 'o' clock at night, and then I, like, chill. But sometimes I'll respond to comments during that time frame. And content planning is difficult for many businesses. So, the better you get at it, the further it distances you from your competitors in a good way. So, once you get really good at this, this is something that not all business owners are good at and they need help doing. And once you start drilling down your messaging and getting better with your planning and everything, then you're going to start to set yourself apart because your content is more meaningful, it connects with your audience better and that puts you way ahead of other people that aren't even focusing on some of those things. So, here are my content planning tips and they kind of flow through the process. You'll probably see where I start talking about the different parts of my framework. So, one of the first things you want to do is identify the types of content that works best for your audience. And what I always say, excuse me, is you know, before you can create a content plan, you need to create a content marketing strategy basically.

[00:09:48.510] - Heather
And that involves doing a lot of competitor research. And at the end of this, I'm going to jump in and do some competitor research with you, so that you can see what I mean. But part of this is looking to see what content they're using and what content or even evaluating your own content that you currently have and see what types are working. So, identifying the types of content that your audience likes is crucial. If your audience prefers to watch videos and hang out Instagram, they will probably watch a lot of reels for example, so that's video. Other content examples include live streams, like Facebook livestreams, user-generated content and that would be like, if you have a challenge or say you have a bingo game in one of your summits, and you encourage people to share that bingo game and tag you, so that's basically promoting you. You know these people are in this challenge and they're loving what they're doing and they're promoting you. So, user-generated content is becoming more and more popular. Then there are challenges in contest which I just mentioned. But you know, a challenge could be a five-day challenge on content planning for instance, or content creation, anything that you can spend a day on a certain piece.

[00:11:15.420] - Heather
Like I have a five-step niche process called the niche ninja, and there's five steps. On day one, I can work on step one and help my people, you know, do that. Day two, I could help them do the second part. Day three, I could guide to the third part, and so forth and so on. So, those are powerful too. And then there are checklists. And I don't necessarily mean like the checklist on your blog, although definitely promote your free checklist, but it's more like social media images that have checklists on them. Also, questions. Questions can get a lot of engagement. Memes and Gifs clearly are popular, and I'm excited because I'm in a course right now that teaches you how to make your own gifs and gif yourself. And then there are case studies like client success stories. Infographics are really shareable. Polls and quizzes, like I think those are some of the most fun content to actually do for people. And I think polls and quizzes work in just about every niche. Excuse me, I've been almost coming down with a cold. And then there are reviews and testimonials, live articles, comments, and quotes, and how-to guides.

[00:12:27.040] - Heather
And so, here's the get to Know your audience, be a stalker but in a good way. So, the key to attracting your audience and getting them to buy your courses, service and products is to get to know them intimately. Where do they hang out? What do they do in their free time? What are their biggest fears? What keeps them up at night? How can you make their life easier? So, this section, I kind of lumped the two C's together just for this presentation. But here's where you want to create and document a content marketing strategy and plan. And these are some of the pieces of that. It's super important. You can't create a content plan without a strategy. The strategy is the research and thought put into creating an effective content marketing campaign. And then the plan helps you execute your strategy. The strategy is your vision, while the plan is your roadmap to get there and achieve the goals. This process also includes setting goals, establishing content themes, and perfecting your messaging. So, here are some examples of common goals that you want to set for yourself with your content marketing. And you can have different campaigns for different goals.

[00:13:40.320] - Heather
So, increasing your website traffic in one really popular one, sales and lead generation, increasing your brand awareness, increasing community engagement, and growing your brand's audience. And so, a lot of these kind of can work together. And you will usually have more than one content built clearly, because you probably want to increase community engagement. Like with your people on Instagram, you probably want to increase the engagement with them. Increasing brand awareness is super important. And then growing your audience on all the social media channels, on your blog, like these are really, really important content goals, but there are many more. These are just five of the most common ones. And so, you want to find out where your audience hangs out. And this is key because your industry can greatly affect this and you know your niche, what you do, how you do it, where your people hang out, it's going to be different for different businesses. So, it's vital to your success to decide which channel to focus on. And if you're just starting, I recommend you sign up for multiple accounts on different social media channels, so that your name isn't taking. Because my Twitter name got taken.

[00:14:58.990] - Heather
So, I'm the prime example of what not to do, but sign up for them. But only choose one really to focus on and learn it really well before you move on to another channel because that's going to be key. And it's really hard to manage like five channels if you're brand new. If you're established, you probably have already been working on multiple channels and you can keep doing what you're doing. Just try to make sure you're where your people are. So, the different channels are like Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, Clubhouse, TikTok Twitter, LinkedIn, the WhatsApp, pinterest, Snapchat. And here's where you know, the industry that you're in affects the platforms for you. For instance, Pinterest is a great niche for crafting, DIY, beauty, all that. But security companies likely won't find their audience there. I mean, you don't see many professional security CEOs and such on Pinterest. I mean, that's clearly a very distinctive but they're going to be on LinkedIn. Whereas if you're in crafting or DIY, you're probably not going to be on LinkedIn because LinkedIn is more for professionals. And it's not saying that crafters and DIYs aren't professionals. It's just saying that that is more for like, it's not just for CEOs, but it's more on the business side of things.

[00:16:18.780] - Heather
It's the number one social media channels for businesses. So, yeah, you need to find out where your people are hanging out. That's super important. And competitor research is really important too. It's very helpful as it can help you figure out what type of content works best for your people, the social media channels they use, the topics they talk about, and more. So, when you're looking at their social media problems, look at the following. First of all, what platforms are they on? What are they posting about? What hashtags are they using? And I'm going to show you some of this in just a little bit, and what posts are working for them, and what are the comments on those posts. And it's not enough to know what social media channels you want to use, you need to know how to manage them. So, how will you manage your social media channels? Are you going to use a tool like, for instance, I use publer or post schedule or social bake? Or are you going to outsource that management? When Pinterest, before Pinterest lost his mind and went crazy, I had a Pinterest manager that was getting me a lot of traffic.

[00:17:19.530] - Heather
I had up to like 1 million, you know, viewers a month or views a month. So, I outsource that because I just didn't have time to grow my community. And she did a really great job. And then from your competitor research, and I mentioned this a little bit ago, with the different types of content, you would decide on those types of content that you want to create. So, through that competitor research and then your preferences decide on the types of content you want to create in your content marketing strategy. Don't worry, you can create various styles. Just make sure you include some that your audience likes best. Note that video should be at least one of these, as it's very popular across almost every industry. I can't think of any industries that don't use video. And if you're not comfortable, I get it. I used to hate video, but the more you do it, the better you get. Like if you saw me on Instagram reels in the beginning, I sucked. And I still have problems lining up the lipsyncing, but I just have fun with it. And that's the whole idea. Like I'm laid back and have fun and that's part of my brand.

[00:18:22.090] - Heather
So, decide on those types of content that you want to create, and you can use some of the ones that we listed. Now it's time for demonstration. So, we're going to exit all out. I'm using Helen in between. It might be Helen in between. I might be saying her name wrong, but she's a very, very popular travel blogger. As you can see, she has $216,000. She's a really good one that I wanted to comment on and to use as an example. So, she mostly does reels. I think she might have yes, she mostly does reals. And she just went to New England for, I think it was in September, probably maybe the beginning of October for the lead changing, which over on the East Coast we have some beautiful, beautiful lead change colors. And so, she went up there. So, I can look at, you know, what type of, a lot of times, short captions work best, but sometimes you want to explain and go deeper into things. So, you can see what types of captions she's using. Here are some of the hashtags she's using. She also has these spots up here that you can click on.

[00:19:37.780] - Heather
Oh, wow. She's got a lot I'm trying to bring up some of the stories. It's not because someone has left to expire. That's right, she is from Germany. Oh, this is a story. I think she promotes beauty stuff too. So, does anyone believe the Denver Airport conspiracy theories exist? So, yeah, that is really actually a true thing. That's really funny. So, me, no way. What are you talking about? So, see that's very engaging, like that's just making you laugh, looking at it. So, you can see she does a lot of stories and reels. In fact, I didn't see a whole lot of regular posts, which honestly, I do regular posts because I get some engagement. But at the same time, video is where it's at. So, you can just scroll through, I mean, she has 5000 likes on that one. One of these had like 30,000, I feel like, maybe that was just views. Now this post is 12.2K. Yeah, so she gets a lot of engagement. This is the 38.8 likes, and it's when her husband asks for a glass of milk, which is really funny, actually. Yeah, wait for it. Notice the hair, apparently, he has messed up hair too.

[00:20:56.750] - Heather
She's just really real. And I was speaking at a conference or summit not too long ago and the participants or the people that were watching were like, you guys are just so down to earth. And that's really when you can make people feel comfortable and you're not too stuffy. Being personable and real is perfect. I mean, it's just here are her hashtags that she's using. Travel community, travel tips, travel dogs. You can just bring a lot from this. See, this is like a really short one. And so, then we also have her blog. So, I love her blog, she has so much fun with this. So, take a look at the different things. Like, she teaches about blogging, too, which is how I found her. But you can see all the different. Like, she has these blog posts, so you can actually get content ideas from her on the things that you want to focus on. I love her blog. This must be a lot of places that she's been. So, she has all these guys. This is probably going to be her. Okay, here we go. So, the perfect girls trip, the road trip guide. Like if you're a travel blogger or an RV or all the above, you can get content ideas from your competitors.

[00:22:26.820] - Heather
Like, oh, okay. So, this is the stuff she's writing about, you know Instagram captions, how to use a credit card to travel, seven days in Scotland. You know these are, you know, the things that she loves to buy on sale. And of course, there's hocus pocus, it's funny, so you can really get a lot of information from your competitors. Jump back into my little presentation if I can find it. Okay, there we go. Let's jump back in. So, this is completely wrong. See, here we are in real time having an issue. So, I am actually going to be giving you guys 20 questions that you need to ask yourself when creating a content strategy and plan. And these are some really good questions that are going to help you, basically, outline your whole plan, get to know your audience, and understand all the information that you need to know to make that plan. I think it's going to be super helpful for you guys to just sit down, answer those questions. I mean, you can answer them flat out first. You can answer them as you go because they all kind of flow together during the process, and then you'll have all the information that you need.

[00:23:54.240] - Heather
And I am also including my training in the all access pass bundle. So, if you get the all access pass, you will get my Content Planning 101 training that, I did it live, and then now it's a course. So that it will guide you through the process of getting your content plan mapped out in two days or less. So, I hope this information was really helpful other than my blunder here with the blog post outline, which is not what you're getting. But I'm just really excited about this topic, if you can't tell. And I can't wait to see how you plan your content. So, I hope you have fun seeing the rest of the presentation. Bye.

**Transcript:**
Heather Ritchie [00:00:12]:
Hey, y'all. And welcome to this presentation on creating content that converts strategies for bloggers. I know we've all been there. You know, we put our heart and soul into content, and then it seems to fall flat or nobody's engaging. And you're like, what am I gonna do if I can't create content that converts? And it's a never ending overwhelming cycle, isn't it? Well, I'm gonna help you with some of that with my special framework. But first, if you don't know me, my name is Heather Ritchie. I am a certified content marketing strategist, SEO content writer, and AI specialist. So I just I create content for clients.

Heather Ritchie [00:00:50]:
Every day I create content. I love it. But even for me, it can be overwhelming when you have emails and blog posts and social media posts and everything that you need to do. So we're gonna give you a framework that can help you walk you through the process, and let's dive in. So first, what you're gonna learn is you're gonna learn how they like, analyze and compile audience insights so that you can create content actually connects and converts and makes you money. We're gonna also talk about setting clear, measurable goals that we're gonna drive your success. And then I also wanna talk about mapping out content strategies that are aligned with what your audience wants and needs, whatever preferences and needs and challenges. And then my favorite part is building a flexible content calendar to stay consistent and on message or similar throughout all of your platforms.

Heather Ritchie [00:01:43]:
Also, I throw in using some AI tools to generate refining optimized ideas, And then we're even gonna jump in just a little bit to scheduling and tracking your content performance to maximize how it impacts people. And then adapting your content strategy in real time as new trends are coming up or anything else you wanna take advantage of or something happens and you just need a search engine. So let's talk about content challenges that blogger space. I've been blogging since 2018. I started my freelance writing business in 2017. And I have seen SEO do all kinds of crazy things over the years, and it's one of the most frustrating things to deal with as a blogger, especially with all of these Google updates. I mean, it's really disheartening when people lose half of their ad income or something because, like, the Google helpful content system update or any of those after that were supposed to help didn't. So I get it.

Heather Ritchie [00:02:42]:
It's hard, but content is the way that we sell and we're just gonna kind of flip it and maybe focus on more about being authentic and creating the content that really helps your people versus creating it for algorithms and things like that. So first of all, it's overwhelming and you may not know where to start because with so many things competing for your attention, we wear a lot of hats. You're the CEO. You're the finance director. You know, you're marketing director. Anything that you can think of, content creation strategist, all of that. So it can get really, really overwhelming. But without a clear plan, your content creation too is also gonna be chaotic and unfocused.

Heather Ritchie [00:03:23]:
You also have problems defining your audience's needs. It's often the hardest part is to pinpoint exactly what your audience wants, especially when you don't have much of an audience yet. So this leads to low engagement in sales. And unfortunately, many bloggers fit, quit, sorry, within the 1st 6 months to a year because they're not making the money they thought they would be. And sometimes it's just a slow process. I'm slower at making money online as other people were. So we all do it in our own different way, but I just don't want you to give up. It's it's reachable.

Heather Ritchie [00:03:58]:
It's achievable. You also don't set measurable goals because without specific goals, it's really hard to know what is working and what isn't much less converting your content into making money. And then there's inconsistent posting. So because you're juggling so much, posting consistently can be really hard. You're also not sure how to stand out because let's all be honest, we're afraid to be ourselves, but that is the best way that you connect with your ideal people. The more I am goofy, funny, cheery, Heather, the more people are drawn to me and I will annoy some people. That's just how it is. Be yourself.

Heather Ritchie [00:04:39]:
It really hard. It really feels hard though to find a unique angle since everything has been done before, but I promise you, you have it. You know, your stories, your experiences is there. Then there's also low engagement and conversion. So your content may get views, but maybe people aren't clicking or they're not signing up for your email list or you're not selling that digital product that you have. And then, of course, the limited resources and time. Managing content creation when you are dealing all those other things often leads to fatigue and burnout, and that's why a lot of people quit or at least temporarily quit. So I wanna introduce you to the Compass content framework.

Heather Ritchie [00:05:16]:
So the Compass framework starts with c for compiling insights and analysis. So you're really understanding your audience better. O, you're gonna set objectives and goals. M, we're gonna be mapping out strategies as a tactics. P, we're gonna be planning your content. A is for AI integration so you can optimize everything. S is for scheduling and planning for measurement, like, putting in your calendar to make sure that you're actually checking your metrics. And then we're studying and making those adjustments.

Heather Ritchie [00:05:48]:
So first, see compiling insight. 1st, you wanna understand your audience's behavior because knowing what keeps them up at night, knowing what they want and how they interact with your content is gonna help you create more of what they need and love. When you're compiling insights, you're also looking at interest and preferences. So tailing your content to your audience wants and needs, that's really gonna boost that engagement and keep them coming back for more. For instance, if your audience is busy single moms, they might like podcast content better because they can listen to it as they work around the house or drive in the car or whatever. So knowing what they want and need is really important and understanding those challenges or some people call them pain points, you really need to address those and your content and your products and services can be that solution because that builds trust and, again, positions your content as their solution and your digital products or services, whatever you have. And then also these insights are gonna help you drive conversions because you're gonna align your content with what your audience wants and needs, and that's gonna turn them into loyal fans and customers. Okay.

Heather Ritchie [00:06:57]:
Sorry. Competitive analysis. Now that I've got my brain working. So competitive analysis is when you're looking at what your competitors are doing. So you're finding the content gaps. You're either finding the gaps that your competitor isn't using so that you can take advantage of them or you're also looking at what they are doing that maybe you're not. And so you're not filling a need that your audience has. And so this allows you to, like, find those unmet audience needs and then covering the things that can help them that's not met.

Heather Ritchie [00:07:29]:
Also, understanding industry standards or niches is really important. So when you're looking at your competitors content, you can see the basics like what is their content quality? Do they post just memes, gifts? What is the frequency? You know, what are the engagement standards? So then you know if yours is on point for that niche or industry. And then really come a competitive analysis helps improve your content strategy because you're gonna learn from your competitors successes and mistakes. And then that's gonna help you over time refine how you create content. And then what's your unique angle? We all have a unique angle. Find ways to differentiate yourself. Stand out. You don't wanna blend in.

Heather Ritchie [00:08:12]:
What makes your content unique? It could be your unique insight. It could be you have a different, something that is not a popular opinion. You may have a different spin like anything. Your experiences help can help you come in. And so because I have a law enforcement background, people have told me they love that. They feel like I work hard and I have served. So that just seems to them to build trust. So there's different things that we have that kind of help us find that unique angle.

Heather Ritchie [00:08:45]:
And it's not always as hard as you think it is to find. And so with goals, I always like to do the SMART goals. So s is for specific. You wanna define a focused and clear content goal, and it needs to align with your business goals. So we're not creating content just for the sake of it sake of it. We are creating content to help our people and to make money because that's how we make money. So if you're aligning your business goals and you're creating the content, so if you wanna say focus on affiliate marketing and quarter 4, then your content is gonna be geared toward that versus launching a membership in January. It's completely different.

Heather Ritchie [00:09:26]:
So just keep that in mind with what you're working on in your business and needs to align with your content goals. So typical goals can be like increasing conversions, freebie sign ups, more engagement, you know, more traffic, whatever it is. Then you also wanna make them measurable. So you need to set metrics so that you can see if you're on track or not. Because if you just say, I wanna make more money in quarter 4, well, if we don't have anything to benchmark by, we we can't create those objectives along the way to see if you're going to meet your goals. So for instance, an example would be, I wanna make 20% more income in this q 4 than last year. So I can look at last year's numbers and say, 20% more is this. If I have not made this by December 31st, I haven't met my goal.

Heather Ritchie [00:10:14]:
Does that make sense? And then achievable. They must be realistic, but you still need it to be a stretch. So you don't wanna say my income goal is $200 a month. I mean, that's good if you're just starting and you're getting $200 a month. Don't don't don't think that that is a bad thing. It's just can you stretch yourself a little bit more? Can you say $500, a $1000? But then it also needs to be, again, achievable because if you're starting blogging or even if you're in your 2nd year and you're like, I'm making 6 figures this year. That might not be achievable and then that's gonna make you feel down and feel like you suck and that you can't do anything right. And so we don't want that.

Heather Ritchie [00:10:54]:
So it must be a stretch but something you can definitely achieve. And then relevant. This is where I said you should align your goals with the broader ones for your business. And I see I have a mess up on my slide, which is kind of typical for me. So see, I'm showing my real stuff. I make I make mistakes. This is real time problems. So it should be relevant, aligned with your business goals and then time bound.

Heather Ritchie [00:11:15]:
So basically, you're saying a time frame. So with this goal, I wanna make 20% more income in this q 4 than last year. So your goal is to meet that 20% more by December 31st. That's the time bound part. Otherwise, you again, you'll just keep going and going and never reaching into your goal because you didn't set a number. And then mapping out content strategy. So this 1st, we're gonna talk about aligning things and topics with search trends and audience needs. So first, of course, you wanna address your audience needs.

Heather Ritchie [00:11:49]:
Choose topics or things related to what they're interested in or the challenge that they are facing. So that's gonna increase relevance for them and they'll engage more. You also want them to support your long term goals though. So pick topics and things that align with those broader business goals to keep your strategy more impactful and focused. So for instance, a lot of my stuff is content creation, but if I am launching my content planning 101 course in January, then for a month before that or more, even more if you can do it. I'm gonna wanna start educating people on content planning and why it's not what they think it is and how it really helps your business and can really blow the roof off of it and all of that good stuff. And then I'm priming people for when it's released. They're like, oh, when it launches or like, this is what I need.

Heather Ritchie [00:12:37]:
So that's why pre launch is always so important. So just keep in mind that you're creating content based on what you're promoting a lot of times. And then you also wanna research search trends. So looking for trending topics or even keywords that you can use can make you more discoverable on search engines. One thing I jumped on was the AI bandwagon quick, and so I create custom GPTs. I've been using AI for about 2 years now, and I use it every single day. So that's something that came up that was not in my original content strategy 2 years ago. And so I had to switch things around or even last year.

Heather Ritchie [00:13:12]:
So I had to switch this year's around if that makes sense because I wanted to meet that opportunity and actually take advantage of it. And then choosing formats and channels that are gonna maximize engagement. So where does your audience hang out? You want to focus on their preferred platforms. So whether that's Facebook, blogs, email, whatever it is. So for example, middle aged CEOs, if that's your audience, they're gonna be more likely to be on LinkedIn. But if you are a female crafter, you're probably gonna be a more on Instagram or Pinterest. So it's just really knowing where your people hang out. And then repurposing is your friend.

Heather Ritchie [00:13:54]:
Write an email and then basically repurpose that email into your social post or into, a YouTube video into a content series that you can do on your blog, any of that. So you can start and then repurpose it for different platforms. And then we also want to create content formats that have the most impact. So things like interactive content and video, they really capture your audience's attention and increase engagement. So if you have a quiz for somebody to fill out, think how fun that is for you to fill out a quiz. Or if you do polls on Instagram or something like that. So those are the things that you want engagement. You wanna do fun stuff because if it's fun for you, it's fun for your audience.

Heather Ritchie [00:14:39]:
And then building a flexible content calendar for consistency. So number 1, make a plan for consistent posting. A plan and a content calendar are gonna keep you on track and they help build that audience trust and anticipation. If they know you come out with a blog post every Wednesday, they're gonna be anticipating that. And also keep promotions and seasonal content in mind. Plan your content around those audience needs launches and seasonal events throughout the year. So clearly Black Friday, we're gonna have a lot of Black Friday content coming out right now and you wanna get in front of your ideal audience because Black Friday is crazy and everybody is selling. So keep those things in mind and then the content that you're creating is like related what I'm creating now is related to my Black Friday offer.

Heather Ritchie [00:15:25]:
What I'll create in January is gonna be related to whatever I launched then. So just keep that in mind and then the seasons because if you work if you have like, if you're in the parenting niche or something like that, then the holidays are gonna be really big for you. So you can turn your content around even if you do business topics into something seasonal. For instance, I wrote a post on how to focus at work basically when everybody's home during the holidays. So that was very seasonal but also business related. And then you do want to allow for flexibility because this is key That flexibility allows you to adjust in real time and you can also respond to any audience feedback, trending topics or events. A lot of times, I sometimes don't know I'm gonna be in a bundle the next month. A lot of people plan ahead, same with summits, but I wanna be able to take advantage of those.

Heather Ritchie [00:16:19]:
So I may have to move my content plan around a little bit, which is why I love Trello so much because you need to just move things around. And then planning your content. You know, you're gonna inventory what you have brainstorm and prioritize. What existing content do you have? Can you identify what has the most engagement or the most traffic and then update it or reuse it to save time, like, repurpose it? You can also leverage that top performing content by refresh refreshing and repurposing your videos, emails, blog posts, everything. Because that can reinforce your messaging and that re purposing excuse me. Repurposing can help you reach newer audiences too. We also wanna prioritize maximum impact. So focus on that content that aligns with the current trends for upcoming promotions, any themes.

Heather Ritchie [00:17:09]:
And again, that's gonna be for relevance and engagement. So with AI being a current trend right now, I just launched a $9 mini course that really sold well, and it was AI content planning. So it's little things like that that just really, really help you out. And if you guys can hear my cat scratching in the background, I'm sorry. He's mad because the window's down. And then you also wanna use AI to save time. I know people are like, AI takes creativity out of it. No, it doesn't.

Heather Ritchie [00:17:40]:
It makes it better. Tools like ChatGPT can actually help you come up with more content ideas that you probably would have never thought of on your own, and it can specify them to your promotions and themes. And then, basically, you're gonna get inspired and have even more ideas, if that makes sense. So I use AI a lot for ideation and writing outlines. So we're talking about integrating AI in. So you wanna identify your audience's challenges using AI. This has gotten really easy. Now AI can analyze audience feedback and trends to reveal their challenges and what can guide your content creation.

Heather Ritchie [00:18:16]:
You can even ask ChatGPT to tell you more about your audience. And, of course, we talked about this in the previous slide, generate new ideas. AI can help you brainstorm content ideas and then you it's really good for repurposing to different platforms. And then it can help with repurposing and optimizing your content. So ChatGPT and some other tools can actually help you freshen up your content or give you suggestions on how to refresh it, how to adapt it to different platforms in different formats. So it's very helpful in those things. And it's a good troubleshooter if you're having, like, a WordPress problem or something like that. Ask chat gpt.

Heather Ritchie [00:18:56]:
It can also help you identify content gaps. So it can you can have it analyzed, like maybe if your competitor has a blog page, you can put that into chat GPT and say, hey. Can you identify any content gaps here that my competitors are missing? And then what insights are you getting and how can I use that with my own content? And then scheduling and planning for measurement. So this is basically ad checking your KPIs or key performance indicators into your calendar. Schedule those regular checks of your key performance indicators like the shares, click dues, and all of that. And then track in real time, like use real time data to make decisions. You may wanna spin to another topic. You may find that you're getting absolutely no engagement and so you may want to ask AI or something like this is what's happening.

Heather Ritchie [00:19:46]:
What's popular right now or what can I focus on that's gonna make that's gonna attract more of my people? And then you always wanna be continually improving your content. All of us look back to a month ago, a year ago, 2 years ago to content and we cringe because we're like, oh, that was so horrible. But that being said, that helps you grow and you go through that and you need to get those experiences. So always be using data because when you assume things you're often wrong. So use data to actually make decisions. And then this is the studying for adjustment. So, basically, analyze what is working in your content strategy. So review those metrics.

Heather Ritchie [00:20:26]:
What content performed well? Maybe there's some trends and preferences that you didn't see, and you can even run that through. Like, you can tell chat GPT here are my numbers. Can you help me analyze this? And it's really good at that. And then using those insights, you wanna refine your strategy. So what did you discover with all of your metrics and the content that you're creating? This is gonna allow you to focus on meeting your people's needs and what drives those conversions so you can do more of what's working and eliminate what is not. And then, of course, adapt your content in real time. So because of this flexibility, Compass' framework allows you to adjust based on any new data so that your content strategy is always relevant and it's always effective, stays up to date. So at the end of the month, quarter, or year, I think that you should plan your main launches and promotions for the next time frame.

Heather Ritchie [00:21:24]:
If you're just starting, maybe do a month at a time, even a quarter, and you wanna plan your content around those things that you're promoting, whether it's your own offers or affiliate, whatever it is, so that it educates your audiences and sets those products and services up as a solution like we have said. And let me exit out because I wanna show you my some of my content planning Trello boards. So this is my yearly content planning Trello board. And so this is an example of I'll go through here. This is a blank one. But at the end of December or the beginning of January, I'll try to map out my promotions. But keeping it flexible allows me to move these cards around in case I wanna change something because I didn't know I'd be doing all these AI resources this year. So I had to switch some other things around that weren't as important as staying on that trend because that's helping me make money right now.

Heather Ritchie [00:22:19]:
That makes sense. So I absolutely love this. It goes through the whole year and I just think it's fun. You can also add the different types of content for, each platform that you wanna use. There's also I can see it better here. I have a quarterly Trello board and then I have I'm probably missing it. There it is. My monthly content planning Trello board.

Heather Ritchie [00:22:47]:
So if you just wanna focus on a month, you can do the you can do it all in one list or you could do a different list for each week. You can put your goals here, your content ideas. I also, which I love, have what I call a content creation idea vault if I can find there it is. So this is my content creation idea vault where any idea I get, even if I'm on the go because I have the Trello app, I can pop it right in here. So I have everything from how to content ideas, personal experiences, and you don't see anything because these are my templates actually that I sell. But, you know, I have freebie ideas, newsletter ideas, products and surveys, quick tip, seasonal, all of this. It goes on and on and on So that when I'm thinking of something, I'll be like, oh, yeah. I really wanna do a roundup post on these 25 best websites to find freelance jobs.

Heather Ritchie [00:23:40]:
That makes sense. So this is something that really helps me stay on track and then I have a a solid content creation system. Let's see if I can. I do not like when that pops up. Okay. We'll go back in. So I also wanna briefly mention the content the compass content life cycle. So this is basically a cycle that's like never ending.

Heather Ritchie [00:24:09]:
You gather insights by deep diving into your audience's challenge and needs and goals and all of that, And that's gonna inform how you create content and your strategy. Then you're gonna plan and execute that strategically. You're gonna match your business goals with your content goals and bill it really be strategic with the content you create. Map out your channels, your format, your topics. If you haven't done this yet, a lot of us have like our basic content pillars that we talk about. You know, align, think of what you want to launch, think of what you want to promote, and then align all of that. Like you may quarter 4 is a big time for people buying. So affiliate stuff, your own products, and you know, it's a big time to make money.

Heather Ritchie [00:24:55]:
So this is what I'm focusing on in this quarter. And then of course, track and adjust. So pay attention to those metrics, what's working, what's not, and then adjust it in real time. And then, of course, you always wanna be making better content and improving it. So with the Compass framework, each content cycle builds on the previous one. So it is a continuous loop, but you're adding in data so that you can make better decisions and then really get into the mind of your people so that you can create content they love and that they buy from you. So I did wanna say I have actually created a PDF for you that walks you through. It's a guide of the Compass framework.

Heather Ritchie [00:25:36]:
So I'm so excited for you to have this. I created specifically because this framework is one that I talk about some of my other courses. So do not forget to sign up for this. It should be below the bottom. Again, it's going to walk you through everything that we talked about basically in this presentation. And I really hope that you've picked up some gold nuggets and that you are gonna feel so much more confident about the content that you create. So thank you for being here. It's been amazing.

Heather Ritchie [00:26:07]:
And, yeah, I'll see you next time.

**Transcript:**
[00:00:13.370] - Speaker 1
Are you ready to choose a profitable niche for your blog? I hope so because that is exactly what we're getting ready to do. My name is Heather, and I blog over at Ryder's Life for you. I'm a certified content marketing strategist and freelance niche writer who creates SEO-optimized content for other bloggers and business owners. So I know a little bit about content writing, and I know a lot about choosing a niche because it was seriously one of the hardest parts of blogging for me

[00:00:41.270] - Speaker 1
I mean, you have all these ideas in your head. How are you supposed to choose just one little topic to write about? Well, it's a little bit more than that, and it's actually a little bit easier than you think. I have a five-step process that I'm getting ready to walk you through. That not only will help you brainstorm a bunch of ideas for possible niches, you can do it'll also help you validate that niche, so you can make sure that it's profitable and popular right from the start.

[00:01:11.150] - Speaker 1
Choosing a niche is a big thumbing block for a lot of people. So you're not alone if this has been something that you're faltering with, so we're going to get ready to hop on into the presentation. Okay, we're going to jump into how to choose a blogging niche in five easy steps. This is my easy process of finding a money-making niche right from the very start. And so let's get going

[00:01:36.290] - Speaker 1
Here is what you'll learn. You'll learn what a niche is, why you need to niche down my method, which I called the Niche Ninja method because you're going to be a niche Ninja when you're done with this training and how to validate your niche. So what is a niche? A niche is a primary theme or topic that your blog revolves around. It's the subject that all your content focuses on.

[00:02:04.670] - Speaker 1
And you could also say it's an audience because you're writing to that one specific person on that one specific topic that they need help with, and that help can be entertainment.

[00:02:17.090] - Speaker 1
Maybe they're a new mom and they need help around nursing. It's your one topic that you really focus on.

[00:02:28.610] - Speaker 1
So why do you need a niche? Well, you're going to hear people that say you don't need the niche down, and then you're going to hear people like me say you need to niche down. And here's why. So Niching down allows you to establish expertise. And it also helps Google understand what you're writing about.

[00:02:50.450] - Speaker 1
And I'm going to use lifestyle blogs as an example. And don't get me wrong. Many lifestyle blogs can be popular. It's just that if you have a lifestyle blog that talks about a bunch of different topics, it's going to be harder for Google to understand what you're writing about. And I have a blogging friend that I use as an example.

[00:03:10.250] - Speaker 1
She had a lifestyle blog that had travel mom life weddings and then blogging about blogging. So none of those really go together. Exactly. And they all have different audiences. So she was told to niche down, and she did.

[00:03:30.710] - Speaker 1
She separated those all out into four blogs. And man, she started gaining traction much faster, started making money, and Google started sending her more traffic because it knew what her blog was about. So there really is. I've seen it in action that Niching Down really helps. I even separated out my blog.

[00:03:48.950] - Speaker 1
I was writing about blogging and freelance writing, but they can kind of have a different audience. So I split my blog up. So that's just an example. But why do you need a niche? It helps you establish your expertise.

[00:04:01.430] - Speaker 1
It helps you define your avatar, which is that one person that you're writing all your content. And I have a friend that says, Get to know your avatar so intimately. It's almost like you're stalking. You know their problems, you know who they are? Are they single?

[00:04:18.950] - Speaker 1
Are they married? Get to know your niche, get to know your avatar, get to know what that avatar really needs. So a niche also helps you find your true tribe of people, and it makes it easier to speak to your audience.

[00:04:35.330] - Speaker 1
It also helps you set your business apart from others because it allows you to establish that expertise. You can even stand out in a crowd. And I'll give you an example of Mike Pearson of stupid, simple SEO. Like, everybody knows him as an SEO expert. When you hear Mike Pearson's name, you know who he is.

[00:04:56.750] - Speaker 1
Same with. I'll say, Debbie Gardner. You know, Debbie is really good with SEO. I consider her an SEO expert, too. Your name becomes attached to that topic that you want to focus on and that you want to be recognized as an expert in.

[00:05:14.330] - Speaker 1
And so then also, a niche encourages collaboration, not competition. For example, say, I'm a travel blogger, and I do traveling in Florida. Well, you may know other travel bloggers like 1 may do traveling in Alabama, or you may have one that does traveling internationally or traveling in Europe because you all are in the exact same niche. Then you can get together and share resources and help each other out and share freebies and grow your blog together. It's not competition.

[00:05:50.870] - Speaker 1
It's more like working together. Plus, it also helps you make money faster because Google understands who you are and what you're talking about. They'll start sending you more traffic and more people will start buying your stuff and then online visibility. And that's really important, too.

[00:06:09.230] - Speaker 1
So Niching Down gives you more opportunities. It's not limiting despite what many people will tell you, it actually helps you make more money. It helps you focus on your Avatar's problems because you're speaking to that one person. It helps you create specific solutions to their problems, whether that's services or products plus, your services and products will resonate with them, and you'll find your true tribe of raging fans, which is really a big deal. It actually gives you more opportunities instead of limiting you and you can gain traction faster, just like my blogging friend that split everything up.

[00:06:44.990] - Speaker 1
She started gaining traction much faster.

[00:06:49.370] - Speaker 1
So the niche Ninja method here it is. It's a five-step process, and I have some worksheets that you can get below in the presentation that can help you walk through this process. So the first thing you look at is, what are you passionate about, sports, hobbies, or other similar activities? Number two is to look at niches that revolve around your work skills and education. I'm a good example of that because I was a police officer for 22 years, and so I chose to be a freelance writer on that topic.

[00:07:25.310] - Speaker 1
I help security businesses and law enforcement people and businesses. I write blog posts for them specifically, I am known as a security writer. I'm starting to change that a little bit, but that was my main gig. I wrote content for businesses in the security industry. Then there's what you learned through life experience.

[00:07:48.530] - Speaker 1
And I know a lot of people don't consider themselves experts in something that they didn't go to school on, but that's just simply not true. A lot of people don't take parenting classes and you can be really good at parenting or homeschooling. A lot of people had to start homeschooling. It was a big deal. So don't discount those.

[00:08:11.370] - Speaker 1
And I find that those are often the ones that people are more passionate about and really want to help people with. Then there's research and I lumped all this together because you'll see, if your niche is in demand, you'll look at the competitors and profitability. And then after all that, you cross-reference those niches on your list and narrow them down.

[00:08:33.450] - Speaker 1
So it's the different types of niches passions, life experience, or career education.

[00:08:42.570] - Speaker 1
So passion. It's a lot easier to write articles on something that you're passionate about. And that's why people really hate to niche down because they're like, well, I want to write about motherhood and I want to write about traveling, and I want to write about crafting, and I get it because I'm the same way. I didn't necessarily want to be focused on one thing, but in the beginning, that's the best way to do it to gain traction faster. So what hobbies, sports or other activities do you like doing?

[00:09:09.450] - Speaker 1
Do you like calligraphy? Do you like soccer? Do you like using your cricket things like that? So here are some examples. Calligraphy pickleball, which I had no idea what pickleball it was until recently.

[00:09:23.370] - Speaker 1
It's actually kind of interesting crafting, knitting, adventure, food, wine, running, and travel. And I should tell you right now, there's probably going to be some spelling errors in here. I've already seen some things. I don't know if any of you guys know Kate Doster, but I love her. She's like the email marketing guru, and she came up with something funny because she always had errors in her typing.

[00:09:48.390] - Speaker 1
And she said you can play the drinking game. And every time that you see a spelling error, you take a drink. Well, with me, you'd be taking a lot of drinks just to let you know I'm not perfect. Nobody is. I just thought I'd throw that out there that you all like that.

[00:10:02.670] - Speaker 1
So anyway, we're into a career in education now. So with career and education, like I mentioned, with my example, it's easier to establish your expertise and authority in a niche related to your career or education. My background is I have a bachelor's degree in criminal justice, and I have a master's degree in investigative intelligence studies is what my master is in. So those things really even solidify that hey, in my 22 years in law enforcement, all those things solidify. She's an expert in this.

[00:10:47.810] - Speaker 1
But I just throw that out there because you don't have to have the education. You don't have to be, like, known as an expert right away. You can still help people and still be seen as an expert, even if you don't have a degree, that's not necessary. But it was just easier for me to get started because more people would find me incredible because of that background.

[00:11:09.830] - Speaker 1
So some examples here would be technology. It bartender, astrology, accounting, architect, WordPress development, addictions counselor, archaeologists. Those are just some good examples of that. So then we come to life experience and blog. Niches that involve life experience are often the most popular.

[00:11:33.410] - Speaker 1
Many people overlook these ideas because they don't have a college degree on that topic or a background in it. But you don't need that to help others in these niches. So some examples here are personal finance, frugal, living, beauty, DIY, fashion, mom, life or parenting, pets, weddings, product reviews, starting an online business.

[00:11:56.690] - Speaker 1
Then we come to the research and demand profitability and competition. So the research is one of the most important parts because you need to research potential competitors and see if your niche is in demand. Because if it's not, then nobody is going to be searching for it. When you look for competitors in your possible niches, you can see how they make money. And that's a way to figure out if a niche is going to be profitable. How are other people in that chosen niche making money?

[00:12:26.390] - Speaker 1
And is it something that you can do, too? When I get to the examples, I'll show you some of them.

[00:12:33.830] - Speaker 1
Do they make products? Do they offer services? Do they make money through affiliate marketing? And you also need to see if your niche is in demand and popular? Are people searching for it?

[00:12:44.810] - Speaker 1
Are people looking for it? Does it have problems that need solving?

[00:12:51.090] - Speaker 1
So how do you see if your niche is in demand, who your competitors are and if it's profitable? Well, you use keyword tools basically like Google Forms and even Amazon. Amazon has a ton of information on it, as I'll show you, as is Google. So the tools that I mentioned on the following slides, some of them I'm going to give you an example of and show you how to do it. They can help you validate your niche so that you know it's popular right from the start.

[00:13:17.430] - Speaker 1
So tools you can use for validating your niche. Google, Amazon, the Google AdWords Keyword planner. And then you can use keyword research tools like key Search. Ahrefs, SIM rush. You can also use forms, Ubersuggest and Google Trends.

[00:13:37.890] - Speaker 1
So now here's the fun part, narrowing down your niches.

[00:13:42.510] - Speaker 1
While you're answering these questions, you may find that some of your niches overlap you may be really passionate about. We'll say numbers and you're an accountant. So maybe personal finance or accounting, something a topic like that is going to be one of those that you're really interested in and see that cross-references into some of the other choices.

[00:14:11.790] - Speaker 1
Maybe you love frugal blogging or frugal ligging. I got my Tang tumbled. Anyway, maybe you love frugal living and have a background in finance. If you find a profitable one that you're passionate about and you have a background in it, that is even better.

[00:14:29.310] - Speaker 1
That is like where you get gold stars.

[00:14:33.030] - Speaker 1
So what you need to remember is passion. What are you passionate about? What hobbies and sports do you like in your career? What are your career and educational background? Your life experience?

[00:14:47.010] - Speaker 1
What have you learned through your life experience? And then you do the research part where you look for competitors and profitability and see if it's on-demand and that's it. You have your perfect niche. That's really simple.

[00:15:04.390] - Speaker 1
When you have the worksheets, you can actually walk through this process and pick several niches that you want to validate. And that's what we're going to jump into now as some of those tools that you can use. Let's hop out of here.

[00:15:26.650] - Speaker 1
Okay. I'm going to start with Amazon. I love Amazon and they've changed this up a little bit from my training. I do have a blog post that you can reference while you are actually doing this whole process with the worksheets and everything so that can help you stay on track. And here's where Amazon is so amazing.

[00:15:52.870] - Speaker 1
So you'll see here what you used to do is you used to put your cursor in here and then just hit the enter without adding anything to search, but it doesn't do that anymore. It's a little bit different. You can see these are some of, like outdoor recreation, Amazon business, sports, and fitness. If you're in sports and fitness or outdoor recreation. If it's shown at the top of Amazon, that's a good sign.

[00:16:15.370] - Speaker 1
That means that it's popular. But you can come over here to all and you can shop by Department and so you can look here beauty and health. Maybe you want to be a beauty blogger, but I'm going to go outdoors since we already see that that's profitable. I'm going to go camping and hiking here. You hit camping and hiking and you come in here and you can see some of the most popular topics, like tents and shelters, camp, sleep, camp, kitchen, camp furniture, apparel, hydration and filtration, hiking, and backpacks, footwear.

[00:16:49.450] - Speaker 1
All that good stuff. If you go in here further, you're going to see that you could be selling some of these things.

[00:16:59.230] - Speaker 1
This is how people in that niche make money. They are Amazon affiliates or affiliates of other programs, and they write blog posts or product reviews. Or you could be writing about how to camp as a beginner. And you can add links to these things in your blog. And you could do affiliate marketing.

[00:17:19.150] - Speaker 1
So you see there and you can really even sometimes go down the rabbit hole. It's not allowing me to do it as much as it used to. So you'll see outdoor recreation. These are even more popular topics, so you can go cycling. So you want to talk about cycling only.

[00:17:37.090] - Speaker 1
So you can see there's a whole bunch of things that you can write about. Bike accessories, adult bikes, youth bikes, trailers. There's so much here. So outdoor recreation is a pretty big thing. Let me just see if I can look at something else different just to show you how about home and garden.

[00:18:00.110] - Speaker 1
There's a lot of popular blogs that are gardeners or even the home setting. Blogs are really popular, too. So let's get a garden and outdoor and see once again, here you go. Plant seeds and bulbs, patio furniture, patio seating. All of this shows you that gardening is popular.

[00:18:19.490] - Speaker 1
There are a lot of products out there for it, and you can really see that that is absolutely true. These are some of the products you can be an affiliate for. So I'm going to show you even just how to use Google too. So we're going to go camping and I'm going to type camping in. And so you can see what I really want you to look at here.

[00:18:42.770] - Speaker 1
This is where you're going to probably find some of your competitors, like recreation. Gov. But these are some of the big ones. Koa is a big one in that niche. Also, Rei, I'm going to say camping for beginners.

[00:19:03.290] - Speaker 1
Let's do that. There you go. So there's Rei and you can even get topic ideas from here too. Plus, you can use a keyword tool like Key Search and plugins like, you can take this URL and I'll pop over here into Key Search and show you real quick. I love key search.

[00:19:26.210] - Speaker 1
It's an inexpensive keyword research tool. It's awesome. So I think it's under Explorer.

[00:19:34.130] - Speaker 1
It's a competitive analysis. There we go. Organic keywords. You can type that is right here and just type on that specific page and then you're going to see all the keywords that they are ranking for that specific page. There's a ton.

[00:19:50.330] - Speaker 1
So that's a good way to get some keywords for you too, for your articles while you're doing this. But let's go back to Rei so you can see. And this is another way you can look at some of these blog posts and some of these websites. They are likely going to be your competitors. This woman seems she's actually up there on top, which is really good, and she seems to be just a normal blogger, not like Koa or Rei, which is really cool.

[00:20:21.950] - Speaker 1
So these are some of your competitors most likely. And then you can look through blog posts. How is she making money? And she likely has affiliate stuff in here. You see, she has affiliate links.

[00:20:35.450] - Speaker 1
Sorry, my computer is being slow. You'll see. So that's just an example using Amazon and Google, which are both really super helpful tools.

[00:20:50.070] - Speaker 1
I'm going to do the Keyword planner, which this sometimes finding the Google Ads keyword planner can be a bit of a pain. You may need to sign in, and this is Ads. Google. Comhomettools keyword planner, but you should actually be able to type that in Google and pull it up and you'll probably end up on a page like this and you would go to Keyword Planner.

[00:21:22.330] - Speaker 1
It's thinking and taking us along.

[00:21:26.830] - Speaker 1
Discovering new keywords is where you want to go. And some people teach using this Keyword planner for the topics on your blog. Say, I'm a freelance writer, but you can pick topics similar to that you want to write around. That all work together. So for instance, my three main topics are freelancing, freelance writing, and then online business tips, because of course, I started an online business.

[00:21:56.050] - Speaker 1
So those are the three categories main categories for my blog. So I could type in here and let's just keep going with camping.

[00:22:05.110] - Speaker 1
I'm just going to type in camping to start with and hit get results.

[00:22:12.170] - Speaker 1
So what's really interesting here is you can see camping that says the competition is low, which is kind of interesting, but that has 1 million to 10 million monthly views. That clearly shows you that is a popular topic. Even all of this, with 100K to 1 million pop-up tent camping gear.

[00:22:34.710] - Speaker 1
If you want to change that, I want to see if camping for Beginner shows up.

[00:22:43.210] - Speaker 1
Okay, it does. And this is still pretty decent 1000 to 10,000. But the competition is high on that keyword, which is kind of interesting because it's a little bit longer tail than camping is. But camping for beginners is a big topic. If you're in the camping niche, you're going to want to have an article about camping for Beginners.

[00:23:05.350] - Speaker 1
But you can see here camping Tips for Beginners. All of these are pretty high. There are some medium ones in here that you might want to go for. You kind of want to go for low competition or moderate. But if it's high competition, you can clearly see that it's popular.

[00:23:26.030] - Speaker 1
Let's see if there's another one that I can think of off the top of my head to show you.

[00:23:33.170] - Speaker 1
How about let me just type travel in Virginia just to see I'm just going to type something off the top of my head.

[00:23:46.890] - Speaker 1
Okay, so that's low competition, though. So see that one is still popular enough that it gets decent searches. But travel in Virginia seems to be lower competition. You can see lower spots here. That doesn't necessarily mean that it's not popular, but clearly, if something has like, a million hits, that's clearly popular.

[00:24:07.290] - Speaker 1
So that gives you a few more signs. You might want to do a little more research just to make sure that traveling Virginia specifically would be a good niche. If you don't want to restrict yourself to one state, you can travel in the south or southwest or something like that. So there's a bunch of tools and there's more in my blog post. But here's another one.

[00:24:27.990] - Speaker 1
Neil Patel's, Uber suggests Camping and Camping for beginners. If it lets me. I think you're limited on your search for a free word for free searches with Ubersuggest to see that has a high search volume. It seems to be with SEO difficult for Google to rank you, but you can see here, view all the keywords and you can see the search volume so you can see how popular camping is. Just camping is a good hitch because there are so many products that you can become affiliates for.

[00:25:05.410] - Speaker 1
There are so many guides you can create. There's so much content you can create. But if you look, a lot of these are pretty competitive as far as SEO goes, as far as search engine optimization and using keywords in your blog post.

[00:25:24.350] - Speaker 1
So those are basically just some of the tools that I wanted to show you how to validate your niche with. I hope that this really helps you figure out exactly what you want to do.

[00:25:44.210] - Speaker 1
What niche is going to be best for you? It should take the stress off of you because you can tell from these topics that if it's going to be popular or not, and don't worry, just one piece of advice, don't stress too much because a niche isn't forever. If you start writing it and you hate it or you just want to change, you can change. I mean, it's easy to do. You would have to probably buy a new domain name and all that, but it's really not that hard to change a niche or even add a niche if you want to overtime.

[00:26:15.530] - Speaker 1
So I hope that was really helpful. I'll be signing out and get to pick your niche, get to validating it, and I hope that you do it soon so that you can get started and start creating that amazing content because your true audience and your true avatar are looking for you. Somebody out there needs you. They need your help. Please do not focus on what this topic has already been written on.

[00:26:45.290] - Speaker 1
You are unique. Nobody has your spin. Nobody has your experience. And so you can present it in a way that you can still find your true audience. That would be different from me are different from another blogger.

[00:27:00.650] - Speaker 1
So that's all we'll see you later. And I hope you enjoy the rest of the summit.

**Transcript:**
[00:00:11.880] - Jeanette Spencer
Hey, everyone. Welcome to this presentation on getting more from your blog content. So my name is Jeanette, and I'm a business strategist. And I'm also the founder of a company called The Women's Entrepreneurial Network which is an online business hub that provides training, support, community, and resources to women in business. So before we dive into the nitty gritty of repurposing your blog content, I just want to share a little bit about my own journey. You see, I've had the privilege of using blogs to grow my own business, and it's been a really incredible ride. And one of the key strategies that has had a huge impact on my success is actually content repurposing. So a while back, I had a blog post on funnel building that really connected with my audience. It was able to spark conversations, to generate interest, and it also brought in new connections which meant I was able to make more sales. But it didn't stop there because what I did was I used a strategic approach to my content. And what I did is I turned that blog post into a variety of different types or different variations of content that aligned with my audience also, and that had a huge reach which was amazing.

[00:01:23.430] - Jeanette Spencer
And that's why I'm here today to share these strategies with you so that you can have the same results in your business. So whether or not you're a new entrepreneur or you're more established, I've got some good stuff for you, so keep watching. So here's the plan. By the end of this session, you're going to have a toolbox of actionable strategies to help you create a consistent flow of content using your blog posts. That is going to help your audience to remain interested or become more interested in your content and also be more engaged in your content. So without further ado, let's jump in. I'm just going to head over to my slides. Okay, great. All right, so in case you were wondering what content repurposing is exactly, I just want to break that down for you real quick. So content repurposing is a strategic approach to help you leverage your existing content in various formats and on various platforms to extend its reach and effectiveness. And this pretty much involves taking a piece of content that you've already created, which could be a blog post or an article or any other type of content, and then transforming that piece of content into different formats like videos or podcasts or social media posts or infographics and so on.

[00:02:43.910] - Jeanette Spencer
And this pretty much enables us to target a more diverse audience and also to capitalize on the strengths of, you know, a particular social media platform or medium. Okay. So now we've got that out of the way and we've set the stage I just want to quickly look at two primary benefits of repurposing your content which are: firstly, improved SEO so improved search engine optimization; and also heightened audience engagement. So firstly, search engines like Google absolutely love fresh and relevant content. So, when you repurpose your blog post into different formats, what you're essentially doing is creating new valuable content that can then be indexed by search engines which can lead to improved search rankings and also increased visibility. And then secondly, when you take your blog post and adapt it into various forms like infographics, videos, podcasts, or social media posts, like I mentioned earlier, what you're actually doing is catering to diverse audience preferences. So some are going to prefer to read, and then you're going to have others that prefer to watch videos. You're going to have some that love visuals and so on. And this means that by offering multiple entry points, what you're actually doing is making your content more accessible to a wider audience.

[00:04:10.170] - Jeanette Spencer
You know, think about it. You're actually meeting your audience where they are in the format that resonates the most with them. And this doesn't just create a deeper connection, it also encourages them to actually interact and share and ultimately become advocates for your content which is most definitely what we want. Okay. So now that we understand the value of repurposing, let's dive into a seven-day content explosion plan that you can use to breathe new life into your existing blog content. So, each format that I'm going to mention brings its own set of strengths and considerations which offers a diverse array of avenues for your message. Now, I want you to understand that it's not compulsory for you to follow every step in this seven-day strategy. So, feel free when you actually go ahead to implement, you know, to skip over any of the steps or any of the bits or pieces that don't actually align with your business. This guide is pretty much here to kind of provide you with some ideas and some inspiration and a starting point essentially to create a content plan that works best for you, best for your time, and best for your business. So to get more eyes on your content, we're going to be using, as I said, an explosion of content framework that you'll be able to rinse and repeat every day of the week if you choose to.

[00:05:42.120] - Jeanette Spencer
So let's get into it. Okay. So on day one, the journey starts with you actually creating and publishing your blog post, and this is the foundation of your content repurposing strategy. So you can also choose an older blog post, if that's what you prefer, and this could be something that you've created in the past. So just to say you don't -- it doesn't have to be new content, you can repurpose your old content too. Okay. So once your blog post has been created and it's published, what you're going to do is you're going to start spreading the word about it by emailing it to your list and by sharing it on Instagram. Also by sharing it on Threads. Threads is obviously still new to a lot of us, and me included, but definitely utilize it if it's a platform that you are into or that you've started using. You also want to share this on Twitter, again, if this is a platform that you use. So this initial push sets the stage for what's to come next. And again, don't worry if you don't have any of these platforms or accounts, just work with what you have and what works for your audience.

[00:06:57.210] - Jeanette Spencer
Okay. So you've done day one. Now on day two, what you're going to do is bring your content to life with a video. So record a video that highlights the key points from your blog post and that keeps in mind that, sorry, and keep in mind that this isn't supposed to be a word-for-word recitation on, you know, the blog post that you created. This is meant to be an opportunity for you to highlight the key areas and the most compelling insights of your post in a more conversational way. So, this doesn't need to be super professional. So, get all that perfectionism stuff out the way. This just needs to be done, right? And also what I want you to remember is that authenticity is key here. So, when you're creating your video, remember that people buy into you. I mean, you have to create a certain level of content and you have to create, you know, a -- you have to fulfill certain expectations in your business. But ultimately, you know, you're probably not the only person that does what you do, right? But you are the only you that does it. So people buy into you. So, when you are creating videos, try to keep them authentic and fun.

[00:08:21.500] - Jeanette Spencer
And as I said, they don't need to be super polished. So once you've recorded your video, spend a minimal amount of time, if necessary, editing your video before uploading it to either YouTube or if you want to go a bit further, what you can do is actually use a site or an app like CapCut to edit your video into bite-sized videos that you can then share on sites like TikTok or Instagram Reels. Okay. So on day three, what you're going to do is extend the reach of your content by detaching the audio from the video that you created on day two. So this audio could be then repurposed for a podcast if you have one, and this is really going to open up new avenues for engagement. Additionally, adding this audio to your original blog post is really going to allow you to cater to a wider audience and is also going to complement that original content. So feel free to do that too. Okay. So as a way to use your original blog post to grow your email list, on day four, what you're going to do is create a valuable one-page lead magnet that directly relates to and that directly complements your original blog post.

[00:09:41.420] - Jeanette Spencer
And this could be something like a checklist or a cheat sheet or maybe a one-page report, but pretty much something that you can create quickly. It's not going to take too much time, but something that, again, is going to complement that blog post and that your target audience are going to find highly valuable. So, for example, let's say your original blog post offers tips on time management for busy entrepreneurs a really good idea for a lead magnet could be a downloadable productivity quick wins checklist. And, you know, you could make it in a way where it condenses the key strategies from your blog post into actionable steps, so not too much work. You've already created the hard work. You've already done the hard work. It's just kind of reformatting it into a structure that can help your target audience achieve results. Also, don't forget to add an opt-in form to your original blog post because this is obviously how people that are reading your blog post -- so your audience are going to be able to download your lead magnet. Right, on day five, you're simply going to use your blog content to create an article on LinkedIn. This is the easiest day because this is literally a cut and paste job and is another way for you to expand your reach, expand your position and really kind of come across as an authority.

[00:11:11.050] - Jeanette Spencer
Now, I don't know how many of you use LinkedIn but LinkedIn is really good at helping to grow your authority and establish yourself within a certain industry. So once you've published your article, what you're going to do is you're going to share it across relevant groups within LinkedIn and also relevant pages. And then if you have a Facebook page, which you should, what you're going to do is share it there too. Okay. So moving on to day six, what you're going to do on day six is condense the main points of your blog post and turn them into an eye-catching infographic that you can then post on Pinterest and that links back to your original blog post. So I know there's a lot of elements that I'm going through here so you have to stay with me. So, feel free to watch this video again. So, you know, as you are going through, as you are creating your own marketing strategy, watch this video again so that you can really take in the key elements that I'm mentioning because I am aware that there's quite a lot going on here. But anyway, back to day six.

[00:12:21.760] - Jeanette Spencer
So what you also could do with your infographic, if you want to, is link it to maybe a podcast episode. You could link it to the lead magnet that you just created or the video that you would have created earlier on as well. So whatever, again, is in full alignment with your target audience do that. So really think about what makes the most sense for your business. And then on the last day, day seven, what you're going to do is use your Facebook group or your Facebook page to connect with your audience in real time. And you're going to do this by speaking about the topic of your blog post. What you're going to want to do is use your key points. So use the key points of your blog post as a springboard for a live discussion. And remember to add a call to action at the end of your discussion that really easily guides your audience to your lead magnet or some other opt-in to grow your email list. Or, you know, if you want to, you can even use this as an opportunity to offer a pitch at the end especially if your blog post is on a topic that maybe you have a offer on.

[00:13:43.550] - Jeanette Spencer
So if your blog post was on funnels and you have a funnel talk here or a funnel course, then you could definitely pitch this on this day at the end of this live session. So this interactive session is really going to allow you to strengthen your community and also create a deeper connection with your audience which is essentially what you want to do. And that's it. So that's the end of the seven-day content repurpose strategy. Now, before we get to the end of this training, I just want to share a couple of tips for you to consider when using this strategy, mainly because when you're repurposing content, it's important to keep in mind a few of these things just to make sure that your new content maintains the same high standards as your original piece of content. So firstly, remember the core message of your original blog post. That's pretty much the heart of your content. So make sure that it shines through in every repurposed format that you create. And then next, content repurposing is really like giving your content a makeover. So, don't just copy. Adjust the content to fit the new format that you're creating.

[00:14:58.130] - Jeanette Spencer
This way it's going to feel more fresh and more tailored for that specific platform that you're posting on. Next, you always want to be thinking about your audience. So think about what resonates with them in these new formats that you're creating. So, each piece of content you create should really address their pain points and offer solutions. And then if you're into SEO, sprinkle those keywords around. You know it really helps search engines find and love your content which is great at boosting your visibility. And then number five, and this is probably the most important, but don't underestimate the importance of clear and compelling call to actions whether it's encouraging your audience to subscribe, to share, to opt in, or to take another desired action. Call to actions are really important for actually guiding your audience's next steps. And then lastly, learn and adapt. So this isn't a one size fits all deal. So, don't be afraid to test different formats and also different approaches to see what vibes best with your audience and then adjust based on what's actually working. So content marketing isn't about random acts of activity. It's really about having a system in place, and your content strategy provides or it should provide a framework that you're able to refine over time aligning it to or with what works best for you, your business, and your audience.

[00:16:34.720] - Jeanette Spencer
Okay. So here we are at the end of our journey. Hopefully, you've been able to gain some valuable insights into the art of content repurposing. So now, it's time for you to actually go ahead and put this into action. So take a moment to reflect on some of the things that we've covered. You know, ask yourself what the specific pieces of content are that you can repurpose, and also the formats that you can repurpose them into that are going to align the most with your target audience. So, I want you to work on setting clear, actionable goals for repurposing your own blog post. And as a thank you for being a part of this training, I've got a special gift for you, and that is a content marketing planner which is designed to help you streamline your content creation and repurposing efforts. And this plan is packed with actionable tips, templates, and strategies to help you keep track of your content marketing. So hopefully you'll find that useful. And if you want more support, I do invite you to consider joining the WVN Business Club, which is a community of vibrant entrepreneurs just like you who are dedicated to achieving more in their businesses and lives.

[00:17:46.040] - Jeanette Spencer
And as I mentioned earlier, when you join, you get access to resources, support, community trainings, and a whole load of good stuff. So thank you so much for investing your time and energy in this training. Remember that knowledge is power, but action is actually what is going to propel you forward. So, definitely take action and just keep striving to be the best and to really excel in your business. And again, I wish you all the best. Bye.

Liz Stapleton [00:00:00]:
Alright, guys. I'm really excited for the session with Jeff Goins. Jeff, thank you so much for doing this. I appreciate you taking the time.

Jeff Goins [00:00:06]:
Thanks for having me, Elizabeth.

Liz Stapleton [00:00:08]:
Yeah. Because I've been a long time fan of yours. The person I came across you, you were speaking at my very first bincon back in 2015. it's where I picked up your book, The Art of Work, which is dog geared and has all sorts of things over line.

Jeff Goins [00:00:21]:
Yeah.

Liz Stapleton [00:00:23]:
So thank you. I'm excited to have you and get to talk to you about creating content because you're so good at it. So -- Thank you. do you wanna, I mean, Obviously, you've written several books. You wanna just give everyone just a little bit on your background before we dive in?

Jeff Goins [00:00:35]:
Sure. I, am a best selling author of 5 books. soon to be 6. And, I've been doing this since 2010, really. I used to be a marketing director for a nonprofit. Now I write books and teach online courses for writers and creative entrepreneurs on how to succeed, and I Yeah. I I write and share ideas, basically.

Liz Stapleton [00:01:00]:
Yeah. because in the I'm gonna keep referencing it just because it's like I have -- Sure. -- great here, guys. It's great. You should pick it up. but I feel like in a lot of your writing, you tend to educate through great story calling. Mhmm. Mhmm. so how do you go about finding stories from either your life or a lot of times other people's lives to kind of teach.

Jeff Goins [00:01:24]:
So that was the first book where I really started using storytelling. as an important sort of, teaching tool. Okay. And I always appreciated author who did that, but I didn't know how to do it. Right? And, and so I started studying, and I learned a few things from some key mentors either directly or indirectly. I followed Ira Glass for a long time, and he has this great teaching series on YouTube. It's like a five part video series that was pulled from, I don't know, something on television or something. but it's about storytelling and that great quote that kind of became this viral phenomenon several years ago about taste and talent. You know, what no nobody ever tells you is that when you get into this, your taste exceeds your talent. And so that's why it doesn't feel good enough. that quote is from this series about storytelling, and it's a much longer series. And one of the things he says in this teaching series and how to tell a good story is The first thing that you need to understand about telling a good story is you have to find a good story and what makes, you know, this this American life, which is to show. So phenomenal he said is how many stories they throw out. So it's not that they're really it's not just that they're really good at telling stories. It's that they have understood how to identify a remarkable story. And that was something that I took to heart when I was writing that book, and you know, found some really interesting stories, including, the story of my friend, Ginny Pong, my now friend, Ginny Pong. I didn't know her before I wrote the book. Yeah. Who is the 1st Singaporean doula. Right? And so she has this fascinating story about coming into her life's work and describing it as slipping into an old pair of shoes is what it felt like. so I think that's kind of the first thing is a willingness to throw out a lot of bad stories or just not great stories. Right? and then, you know, the second thing that I learned was from Chris Gillevo. He wrote a book called the $100 startup which was kind of in the vein, you know, that I wanted to write there of work, stories of everyday people who had done something extraordinary that people could relate to. And I asked him how he found those stories. And he said, he goes, this might sound, you know, a little bad. But, you know, he said I found that the people who really want you to tell their stories, those aren't the stories you wanna tell. Right? The person who is like, pick me. Pick me. I have a great story. you know, they, they have a reason for that. Right? They have a platform that they're trying to establish or some message that they're trying to get out. And there's nothing wrong with that, but you wanna find the really interesting never heard before stories. And in order to do that, you have to find the people who in some ways are unwilling to tell their stories and get them to tell their story. And so what he told me was you don't wanna find the people who are offering to tell you their story wanna find the people who say, you need to talk to my cousin or my neighbor or this person that I heard about on on the local news or whatever. And, and so I I think that those two things were really helpful for me in figuring out how to tell you know, good stories. And then the other thing I learned just through experience was to tell a good story. You have to ask, to tell, like, a thorough story somebody else's story. Of course, you have to you have to get it from them a few times. You have to interview them multiple times.

Liz Stapleton [00:04:58]:
Okay.

Jeff Goins [00:04:58]:
And and I realized this is what Malcolm Gladwell does. He did a whole podcast with Tim Ferris on how he writes. And he will interview the the person whose story he wants to tell, like, 2 or 3 times Okay. And then he'll go over it again and again and again because the facts change, the details change, people tell their stories in different ways at different times to different people. And you just get more the second or third time, and you get different details. Right? I may tell your story And I want it to be a story about perseverance, but then we, you know, go through it a few times and I go, oh, no. This is more about, like, hope or something. You know? and so there's an angle here that I didn't quite know until I got to the end of it, a theme that I want to explore a little bit more, so I need to talk to you again to figure out without making stuff up. Obviously, I need to find other other pieces in your story that kind of align with this theme that I think this story needs to be about.

Liz Stapleton [00:05:59]:
Okay. Yeah.

Jeff Goins [00:06:00]:
So that's that's that's how I approach that. And I do think in terms of themes, we're not just telling people stories to tell them We're looking for some sort of general theme or lesson, that people can identify because when you're telling your story or any story, people aren't just interested in the story for sake of the story, they want to see their own story in that story.

Liz Stapleton [00:06:19]:
Yeah. And and when it comes to blogging, that's kind of we've touched on this in other sessions where you know, anyone can write a post on 17 ways to, you know, make money on the site or whatever. But the way that it stands out is is the stories you you kind of include and and see, oh, I can fit it into my time because they did it this way. And, yeah, so I think that's a great point, and it ties well into blogging, right, because everyone's you know, you've got your own little slice of webs of the web with an angle.

Jeff Goins [00:06:49]:
Yeah. And and sorry to interrupt, but, There's a difference between traffic and trust.

Liz Stapleton [00:06:55]:
Yeah.

Jeff Goins [00:06:55]:
Everybody wants traffic. 13 ways to do it ever. We'll generate some traffic, and that's great. But traffic is easy to measure. Trust is hard to measure, except when it matters. When it matters, when it comes time to sell the thing or get everybody to buy your book or or you just need your little corner of the internet to be in your corner to support you that's where trust pays off and traffic may not. Right? So just because you get a bunch of eyeballs doesn't mean you necessarily have trust, and I would argue telling stories, being empathetic, being vulnerable over the long haul gets people to trust you much more than, you know, going viral does.

Liz Stapleton [00:07:36]:
Absolutely. No. I think that's a that's a great thing to point out because a lot of people do just focus on, traffic and qualifying for an ad network and, you know, but really building a community that trusts you is it's harder, but it pays off better, and it's and you're gonna like it a lot better, I think. Yeah. You feel better about what you're doing. yeah, because So I know you have this. I just wanna bring it up because a lot of people struggle with being consistent in terms of blogging.

Jeff Goins [00:08:05]:
I

Liz Stapleton [00:08:05]:
know you've got a 31 day riding challenge. but how kind of how do you develop a strong writing habit? Like, what would you suggest things to do? Cause there is so much that goes into blogging side's just the writing, not to mention life itself.

Jeff Goins [00:08:19]:
I was I was talking to a friend recently about anger. And, she has done a lot of therapy. I've done a lot of therapy. and I said, you know, I always understood anger. My therapist always called anger boundary setting emotion. And and she said, yeah, that's true. She said, but I heard A therapist say once that it's also, an action emotion. When you get angry, you take action. and anger, is what leads to action. You know, so people sometimes we stigmatize anger. I shouldn't be angry about this or whatever. and her therapist was saying, no. No. No. Like, you know, why is this not changing, this behavior, right, and she said, I don't know. I just can't beat it. Whatever. because you need to get some anger behind this in order to change this behavior. And so anger is the action that changes things. And so often when we're feeling unmotivated, there's a reason for it. And I I'm not into, you know, naval gaze for the sake of just going, why, why, why, why, why? Cause that doesn't necessarily lead to action. Insights don't always lead to action, unfortunately. which is why you can go to therapy for many years and still deal with the same things. And why you could say, I'm gonna write a book or sort of blog for many years and really, really want to do it and not be able to do it. So I often get this question. I don't know how to answer it completely because it's up to you. Yeah. And the reason that it's up to you is that you have to eventually get so angry at yourself not not beat up on yourself, not shame yourself, but get angry that you're not doing the thing that you say you wanna do so that it leads to action so that you get motivated to do it. I don't believe that you can force yourself to do something you don't really want to do. Mhmm. It won't work. But lack of motivation, usually is about some pain that we're trying to avoid, some fear or shame or discomfort that we're trying to avoid. So one, you've gotta get a little bit angry. Right? And then 2, you've gotta do it, even when you don't feel like it, which I know sounds like well, duh, but I think the way that that happens is we all get caught up in certain negative thought patterns. And and that's where where procrastination comes from. It's, we're seeking pleasure in temporary ways and we're avoiding pain that there's the pain and discomfort of doing this thing that we're not good at. We don't like right now because we're not good at it. and we associate it with pain. And so what you have to essentially do is you have to retrain your brain to associate this activity the pleasure, not pain. And people do this with working out all the time. They do with all kinds of things. Right? you've got to you've gotta change your thought pattern about this. And the best way to do that is with action. Right? And so Victor Frankl says between the stimulus in the the response, there's a space. And in that space, there's a choice. Right? So when I'm not feeling like doing something, I can become aware that I I'll go, oh, I I don't feel like doing this. Well, do I really wanna do this? This is as important to me, yadayadayada?

Liz Stapleton [00:11:30]:
Yeah.

Jeff Goins [00:11:30]:
Okay. What one small thing that I can do to just make it half in. Right? So in the case of writing, just write something. This is how I started writing every day was I just wrote something. And eventually, it was, like, you know, 500 words or whatever, but, like, early on was a sentence or 2 or a paragraph. And I do this to this day. I'm avoiding writing a book right now, and and today, I just locked off some time. And and I've got 4 hours blocked off. Right? And I will find every reason to not do that. And the way that I'll get into the groove is I'll just have to write something there's 2 things that I do.

Liz Stapleton [00:12:03]:
1,

Jeff Goins [00:12:04]:
I just write something, especially if I'm dealing with a habit that I, can't, you know, really stay on top of. and then I'll immediately reward myself. Right? and this it sounds it can sound silly, but this I mean, Neil Fiori, one of the leading psychologists in the world procrastination. So it's basically when you're procrastinating, which is you can call it whatever you want when you're not doing the thing that you say you wanna do. You're procrastinating. there is a childlike version of yourself inside of you that says, I don't wanna do this, and you can't make me. My my my three year old recently, I was trying to put her to bed.

Liz Stapleton [00:12:40]:
Uh-huh.

Jeff Goins [00:12:40]:
And she was not having it. You know? And she said, I don't agree with your rules. What am I supposed to do? Go to bed, please. You know, you're pranking me child. you know, I don't agree with your rule. So there's a three year old inside. He goes, I don't like this. I don't agree with your rules. and so what you have to do with the child is you have to, train them. This is a good thing. So, you know, please write this thing, and I'll give you a cookie.

Liz Stapleton [00:13:08]:
Yeah.

Jeff Goins [00:13:08]:
And and I will literally write, you know, if I'm if I'm really struggling with with self discipline, Yeah. I will write something, do something, and then I'll go have a smoothie or a latte or a cookie. Mhmm. And and and you will, I mean, it it it affects your brain. And so, that's my approach to it is is you've gotta get to the root of why you're doing this. And if you really don't wanna do it, just be honest, I don't wanna do it and do something else.

Liz Stapleton [00:13:36]:
Yeah.

Jeff Goins [00:13:36]:
but if it's just a question of, I really need to do this. You might need to get a little bit of anger around, Right? Why haven't you done this? Yeah. You know, what is that about? Let's do you really want this? Then get serious about it. Do something very, very small. tiny habits, you know, 10 minutes. Yep. And then reward yourself and do this over and over and over again, in and until you start to forward to the activity. and it doesn't mean that it's not hard and there's plenty of plateaus. That's a part of any process but writing these days is something I look forward to.

Liz Stapleton [00:14:11]:
Yeah. No. I I I totally agree. I I do wanna add on the flip side. my six year old, Nesia, they told me I couldn't do something. And I was like, actually, I can. You know, because when you're adult, you get to make those choices. So don't just do that. I don't wanna recognize you have a choice, and and there's some some privilege in that a little bit. and I totally relate to what you're saying. creating the summit, actually, because I was originally gonna have it last year. And so it got kind of pushed back, but I'm really, you know, and it was hard, but I'm really glad I did it. That's right. And I'm really excited for it now. You know? Good. so we've touched on this a little bit about trust versus traffic and sort of defining success and what you want your business and success to look like.

Jeff Goins [00:14:59]:
k.

Liz Stapleton [00:15:00]:
So, you know, how would you recommend sort of defining success with the blog trust, of course, is one way, but it's hard to kind of measure that, like you said. Any thoughts on sort of --

Jeff Goins [00:15:12]:
Yeah. I mean, success is always just you getting what you want. Right? So I can't tell you what success is like for you, and you can't tell me what success is like for me. It really is subjective. you know, he's successful. She's successful. success, really, I mean, you know, you can just look up the definition. It it is getting what you want, achieving the thing that you set out to do. So step number 1 that most people don't really think about when it comes to success is know what you want.

Liz Stapleton [00:15:37]:
Mhmm. Right?

Jeff Goins [00:15:38]:
So many years, I didn't know what I wanted. I was pursuing other people's definitions of success. and

Liz Stapleton [00:15:42]:
-- -- get those income reports from other bloggers or something. Yeah.

Jeff Goins [00:15:45]:
And and it would make me jealous and angry and sad and depressed and all kinds of things. And I was I was making a $1,000,000 a year feeling like a failure, because I was always looking at somebody else's definition. And I had to start to zoom out and go, do I even have the thing that I want, or is even this version of success somebody like, did I get it from somebody else?

Liz Stapleton [00:16:08]:
Yeah.

Jeff Goins [00:16:09]:
so step number and and I was, you know, I was pursuing other people's definition of success. Step number 1, know what you want. step number 2, put on blinders and achieve it and see if that's actually what you want because you may get it. this is the one I want. I wanted something else. So I think success at, like, a high macro level is, getting what you want and actually getting clear on that and doing it and not worrying about what everybody else is doing. which is hard, but, you know, if you do enough things that other people say that you should do and it doesn't make you happy, at some point, you've gotta decide for yourself What is it I actually want and how do I get it? For me, you know, if I were to to define this and I and I think this applies to a lot of other people, what does success look like? for a lot of bloggers, it doesn't mean traffic or trust necessarily. It's about a tribe. I mean, the way that you would quantify trust would be through a tribe, a small, but dedicated group of people who are all in Right? Kevin Kelly talks about your 1000 true fans. Seth Gordon describes a tribe as a small group of people, which I think is interesting. When we talk about tribes, we're like, I've got a tribe of a 100,000 or a1000000, you know, people. But, I mean, if you think about that term, historically speaking, you know, tribe was a tribe was always a small group of people, about a 150 people. Right? And and that's that whole idea that we can only Was that Dunbar's number? I think you can only have relationship with about a 150 people at a time. So most times were about a 100 to a 150 people. They got too big. They would break off and make their own tribe because you just couldn't lead that many people that way. this year, I'm experimenting with working with only a hundred people, because I, in previous years, had

Liz Stapleton [00:18:02]:
10, 15, 20000

Jeff Goins [00:18:04]:
clients in a year. And I I didn't I would go to an event and somebody say, I'm in your course and I'd go, you are, you know, I've never seen it before in my life. Right? Yeah. And so I didn't like the fact that I didn't know the people that I was supposedly helping. And and now I'm experimenting with going much, much smaller, and it's a lot more fun. I'm actually making more money. And it's just a different way of doing things. So I think success is having enough people pay attention to you. so that you can make the money that you wanna make and do the kind of work that you wanna do the way that you wanna do it.

Liz Stapleton [00:18:41]:
Yeah. And those less than, I mean, a good traffic number. And I like that your your idea of success may change. It may, you know, it's it's kinda fluid in a way as you figure things out and achieve different things.

Jeff Goins [00:18:52]:
Yeah. I mean, you get clearer as you walk down the road, clarity comes with action.

Liz Stapleton [00:18:57]:
Yeah. No. Absolutely. I mean, I've been blogging for 6 years, and I'm still, like, Oh, actually. You know? Yeah. Exactly. So it never stops. But, so how do you because, you are such a great storyteller? and blogger and just everything, and podcast. And how do you balance sort of the re you know, the reading, the research, and the writing, to create sort of the the content you want?

Jeff Goins [00:19:24]:
I always start with what I wanna say. If you don't start with that, I mean, you know, this is the scientific method, right, start with a hypothesis and then go test it. So I start with what I want to say, and I believe that it's better to be interesting than it is to be good. now I'm not giving people, licensed to be bad, but there are plenty of good writers who are not saying interesting things and we're not paying attention to them. And to be honest, there are plenty of bad writers who are saying interesting things and lots of people are paying attention to them. So what I want for you, dear, writer, is to be both, right, to care about the craft, to write well, and be interesting. Now interesting means that you attack whatever your audience takes for granted that there's always something surprising about what you have to say. And it doesn't mean you have to be controversial for the sake of being controversial. but you've you've gotta say something unique. Right? So when I wrote the art of work, what I realized I wanted to say what I thought I wanna say was everybody's got a calling, and it looks like this. And that's kind of boring. And as I began to do the research and talk to people, I realized that everybody has a life's work in them that they want to pursue and share with the world, but it the process will surprise you about how you get there.

Liz Stapleton [00:20:43]:
Mhmm.

Jeff Goins [00:20:44]:
And, and so when I am writing, researching, editing, all of that, I start with the idea. I go, is this something that excites me? And then I start researching to see if it's true. Right? And then through that research, I tend to find some thread or something that that kind of pops out to me. Oh, look at this. So when I was writing, my latest book, Real Art of Stone, starve. I, started with the idea that there were basically these 2 groups of people creatives who were thriving and those who were not, I thought, what's what what's going on with these people? Right? Is is is one just, you know, one group lucky.

Liz Stapleton [00:21:20]:
Yeah.

Jeff Goins [00:21:21]:
And and as I started research, You know, I thought, I think this might be a choice, you know, being a starving artist. And, and while I was doing the research, I stumbled across the story of Colangelo who had $50,000,000 when he died, and it turns out he was the richest artist of the Renaissance. And I thought, Well, that's interesting. We've got this guy who's one of the greatest artists of all time, and he was wealthy. And he wasn't a sellout. and he wasn't starving. So what could that tell us as a theme as a thread about creative work So, you know, at that point, I start diving into the research, get as much as I can get, and then I go write the book. But I always, as I start working on the book, the blog post, whatever, as I start working on something, I'll run into walls. And I go, I don't know what to do here. I'm out of argument, you know, and I'll have to go do some research to kind of fill in the pieces. But as much as possible, I try to Get the idea, do as much research, 80% of the research, then start the writing, and then go back and kind of fill in the that I'm missing, because you'll you'll get to a point where you go, I I'm making stuff up now. Right? Like, I'm I'm faking my way through an argument. I need another story. Like, I've run out of juice, and I've gotta go back to the, you know, the well and get some more water so to speak.

Liz Stapleton [00:22:37]:
Yeah. No. And I like that you say, you know, when you pump the ideas, does it excite you? Because, you know, in a recession, we talk about, you know, using analytics and keyword research and, you know, yes, those things are important, but you need to find the angle that excites you to make it something that you can really, help I guess. Yeah.

Jeff Goins [00:22:57]:
You know, an SEO and keyword research is great, but understand that all that is is robots trying to understand how people work.

Liz Stapleton [00:23:05]:
Mhmm.

Jeff Goins [00:23:05]:
So you're a person. And if you can figure out how people work, you can work with the robots to, you know, reach the people but if you write for human beings, because, you know, Google's always changing their algorithm and people who are hardcore in SEO, and I, I really was for a long time, you know, googling and and searching and testing, you know, this tag, this title over that one, this headline over that. There's a lot of merit to that. but, you know, one little tweak and, you know, all of a sudden, your dev your business model is devastated because you've you've gone too far in the direction of the robots. And so, you know, I think it's a bit simplistic, but if you always write for humans and the job of the robots is to reach those humans, You're gonna be okay. So remember that you aren't writing for robots or running for humans?

Liz Stapleton [00:23:53]:
Yes. Exactly. And it and it makes it more fun too for for humans.

Jeff Goins [00:23:57]:
Yeah. Again, you're if it's not just about traffic, it's about trust and eventually, you know, having that tribe of email subscribers, followers, people, who are really hardcore into whatever you have to say, you're gonna be able to make a lot of money for a long time with that group of people.

Liz Stapleton [00:24:15]:
Okay. and I think you've touched on it a little bit, but I think especially for newer bloggers that are struggling how do you sort of decide on your angle? Or, I mean, the story that you find helps with that, but your idea, where do you get ideas from early December.

Jeff Goins [00:24:30]:
For, like, a blog for, like, a blog post? Sure.

Liz Stapleton [00:24:33]:
Yeah.

Jeff Goins [00:24:35]:
I I agree with Elizabeth Gilbert that ideas just come to people. you know, in her book, big magic, she describes this, you know, and tell stories of poets and musicians about literally like this idea just coming to you. you know, I'll if if you're not It'll

Liz Stapleton [00:24:49]:
leave you if you don't pay attention to it.

Jeff Goins [00:24:50]:
Yeah. Right. Right. So, you know, I try to take a shower once in a while. I go for a walk once in a while. I drive somewhere once in a while. And ideas hit me. Right? You and I were talking, and I said the thing about traffic and trust. And I thought, you know, I've never said that before. Trust versus traffic. It just popped into my head. And so I wrote it down. So I don't think it's about getting ideas. I think it's about capturing ideas. Right? We are always getting ideas. Ideas are always coming to us. Ideas want to be birthed through us. They want to be made manifest in the world. and so, if you're not getting ideas, you need to slow down. You need to go for a walk. You need to work out. take a shower, step away from the technology, leave your phone for a minute, and just move because ideas will come. So it's about capturing ideas. And for that, I use what I call the 3 bucket system. 3 bucket system. You can Google it. I did a thing with Evernote on it a while back. very simple productivity system for writing. I'm not real into systems and formulas, but this is a thing that I found I was just sort of doing. So I kind of codified it, called it in the 3 bucket system. So basically content creation, writing is 3 things, not one thing. And when you're struggling with writer's block, it because you're trying to do all three things at once. So it's coming up with ideas. It's drafting those ideas into something readable and then it's editing it into something publishable. Right? So it's, I ideation coming up with an idea, writing, and then editing. So it's, you know, good. Right? Yeah. So most people go. They sit down. They go, alright. I I saw this thing on a blogger breakthrough summit. I'm gonna do this thing now. And, they sit down at 6 AM and they go, idea, idea, idea. I don't know. And, this idea, and then they start, you know, they spend 20 minutes doing that. And then they ride, and they feel bad about us. Not very good. You know, type, type, type, delete, type, type, type, delete. It's a lot of pressure, right, for, it's like, here's a canvas. fill his canvas with something beautiful and sell it by noon. Right? and so I use what I call the 3 bucket system, which means I'm always capturing ideas I just wrote an idea down. So that's my rule. My first rule is you get an idea. You write it down. It doesn't matter where you are. Right? you're at your kids recital. You're at church. synagogue, you know, whatever, you, you, you write it down. And then you go back to being present, right, from that family dinner or something and get an idea. I go, hang on one second. Type, type, type, type, just a word or a sentence, not 500 words.

Liz Stapleton [00:27:22]:
Yeah.

Jeff Goins [00:27:23]:
I capture the idea, then I have a meeting with myself every morning to write for about an hour or

Jeff Goins [00:27:30]:
And then I take one of those ideas out of my idea bucket and I put it into my drafts bucket and I 500 words on it. And I stop at about 500 words. I save it, and I and I put it into another bucket. Right? And I use just a tagging system on bear that allows you to very easily go, okay, this is in drafts. Now it's, you know, this is idea bucket. Now it's in drafts, etcetera. And then I will take something out of my drafts bucket that I wrote a previous day could be yesterday or 2 weeks ago or 2 months ago, and I edit that and get that ready to publish. And sometimes I'll do this, you know, I'll I'll come up with an ID on Monday, right, and then Tuesday, I'll draft it. And, you know, on Wednesday, I'll edit it. But meanwhile, I'm doing I'm doing other things. And so the system is not about writing something, editing it, and getting it ready to publish. It's about always having ideas and capturing those ideas. So I've got a bucket full of ideas. Mhmm. It's about taking those ideas one one at a time and drafting them into something So I've got a bucket of drafts, and then it's editing those and getting them ready to publish. So I have a bucket of edits. And so at any time, I sit down, I've got something to work on. And my job, writing every day, is not about coming up with some staggering work of genius, It's just about moving something from one bucket to the next. So as long as I'm capturing ideas and I've got ideas in my idea bucket, as long as I'm moving one idea to the draft bucket, one draft to the edits bucket, I'm doing my job.

Liz Stapleton [00:28:55]:
Yep. And and I like the idea of the buckets because, you know, if you've got multiple things in each bucket, then you don't have to worry about, you know, being consistent. You're gonna manage it.

Jeff Goins [00:29:04]:
You never have to worry. You if you do this, it'll take 3 days. You'll never have to worry about what to write again. Day 1, get a bunch of ideas. Stop. Mhmm. Day 2, you've got ideas. So now you you you draft some things. And now you've got 2 buckets. Right? You've got a couple of ideas, your idea bucket, and now you've got something in your draft bucket. You stop, and that's day 2. Day 3, You're still getting ideas, you know, and then at least you gotta get more ideas in your idea bucket. You take your draft, and you edit it then you go back and you take one of your ideas and you draft it again. Now you got something in all three buckets, and now the game is just to keep the buckets full.

Liz Stapleton [00:29:40]:
Yeah. No. I do wanna ask you. I'm just curious because a lot of times my writing is actually dictating.

Jeff Goins [00:29:47]:
Oh, yeah. Uh-huh.

Liz Stapleton [00:29:48]:
Do you so, you know, do you think does that matter?

Jeff Goins [00:29:51]:
Does -- Does that count?

Liz Stapleton [00:29:52]:
-- your thoughts on that? Well, I think it counts, obviously. I've put out a ton of content that way, but you know, I'm a more of a talker than a right. I was a math major. The fact that I'm a blogger's. Yeah.

Jeff Goins [00:30:01]:
That's great.

Liz Stapleton [00:30:02]:
you know, but sort of in terms of utilizing that time because if I'm walking and talking, I just get things flowing better.

Jeff Goins [00:30:10]:
Yes. Yeah. I I I do the same. speaking and writing are different crafts for me. And so if you do that, I still think, you know, you sit down and you edit it and you kinda wrap some around it and all of that. but I find it, you know, I agree it's a great way to get ideas down for sure.

Liz Stapleton [00:30:27]:
Yeah. Yeah. I know. I -- And

Jeff Goins [00:30:28]:
you get a lot

Liz Stapleton [00:30:28]:
of content. Yeah. Yeah. no, I was just curious because the way you're describing it. I was like, that's actually I was like, I come up with an idea and outline, and then I go dictate. And then I -- Oh,

Jeff Goins [00:30:38]:
that's great. Yeah. A lot of people just ramble and I find I've done that before and I find that's not as useful. Yeah. I do a lot of speaking. And so what I'll often do is I'll, kind of like write, like, a talk, you know, and I'll and I'll just kind of rant on it. I'll ramble a little bit on my podcast.

Liz Stapleton [00:30:56]:
Yeah.

Jeff Goins [00:30:57]:
my podcast is audio essays, basically. And then when I'm done with that, I'll sit down and I'll write it because now I've gotten all the ideas out. And and as you're talking, you'll go, wait, this is is this a work like this? Hang on. I gotta pause it and go back here. So by the by the end of talking through it, you're very clear on the idea. And then you can sit down and really turn it into a good piece of writing instead of trying to write your way through it.

Liz Stapleton [00:31:19]:
Yeah. No. I I and I think I think I find, you know, because you're going to get to the editing point. Right? So much easier when there's stuff on there. Even with the bad stuff.

Jeff Goins [00:31:27]:
Oh, I agree.

Liz Stapleton [00:31:27]:
Yeah. Like, just have something on the page. Mhmm. But, yeah, so don't don't stress yourself about the good writing during the writing portion of the or the drafting portion bucket.

Jeff Goins [00:31:37]:
Yeah. You're just getting ideas down. You're just getting words down.

Liz Stapleton [00:31:39]:
Mhmm. Yeah. okay. And I did wanna ask you about kind of tools. You said something about Bear. What

Jeff Goins [00:31:46]:
There, b e a r. I think it's only for Mac and iOS at this point. it's like a beautiful note taking app. It's just real simple. it's what I use. You could use Evernote. It's it's like a simpler version of Evernote where you use lots of tagging and stuff. So, I I use it to blog. I use it to take notes. it's my note taking out.

Liz Stapleton [00:32:05]:
Okay. I was just yeah. are there any other sort of tools or things you'd recommend to help people set up and fill those those buckets?

Jeff Goins [00:32:13]:
If you're working on a book, I use scrivener for that, but just blogging bear, b e a r is my tool. anything that just gets you writing doesn't have to be fancy. People get really obsessed about the tools. And should I use this writing app or is that writing app? I just I just switched from, you know, this to Ulysses or whatever. I, a writer. What else? Okay. I've tried all those things and they're all basically the same. You know? I I

Liz Stapleton [00:32:39]:
-- -- different procrastination method.

Jeff Goins [00:32:41]:
Yeah. It doesn't matter. You know? Seth Gordon said once that's, you know, we think that if we knew, what kind of cereal Stephen King ate in the morning, if we ate that cereal, we'd be we'd be like him. You know? And it was when somebody was asking, Seth, how he writes, and he refused to answer the question.

Liz Stapleton [00:33:02]:
Okay.

Jeff Goins [00:33:02]:
He says, because if I tell you that, then you're gonna think that's that's how you should do it. The truth is how I write is just a collection of weird quirky habits that works for me. And so the takeaway is find what works for you, find the tool that works for you. I found that, you know, any tool that's too complicated, I I found that Evernote does too much It's too complicated for me. It's clunky. I'll spend all of my time trying to organize it instead of just dumping words onto a page.

Liz Stapleton [00:33:31]:
Yeah. But I

Jeff Goins [00:33:32]:
needed a tool that helps me do what I do, which is kind of phonetically and frantically just write stuff.

Liz Stapleton [00:33:38]:
Yeah. No. That's why I like asking about tools because it's I could be using something that I'm like, to pay, but, you know, and then I learn. I'm like, oh, this works for my the way my brain works a lot better. not necessarily, you know, because I think the more there's so many out there, and there's no way -- -- overwhelming. Yeah. Yeah. And so hearing kind of what other people use, you can check me like, oh, not for me. Yes. That's awesome. Whatever.

Jeff Goins [00:33:59]:
Yeah.

Liz Stapleton [00:33:59]:
but, yeah, no, I think this is fantastic. Are there any final words you wanna kind of kind of add to?

Jeff Goins [00:34:05]:
Oh, no. I mean, you know, my my sort of stock advice for writers, bloggers, is, keep going. Right? People

Liz Stapleton [00:34:14]:
You're gonna be embarrassed by what you put out at the beginning.

Jeff Goins [00:34:17]:
Yeah. Oh, sure. And and and always, you know, there's always room to grow. And I found out, you know, through a lot of trial and error and just figuring out what, you know, what I wanted to say and how I wanted to say it. most of that stuff, takes care of itself with time. And when I started blogging in 2006,

Jeff Goins [00:34:39]:
You know, lots of people came on the scene after, you know, several years, and we all have the same goals, the same aspirations. And a lot of those people got discouraged and quit and moved on. And I totally get it. It's a very discouraging process. but the people who succeeded were the people who kept going. And so I have to remember that myself, even when I'm facing, you know, whatever, challenge I'm dealing with today, which is plenty. is, really, the difference between a professional and amateur is the professional keeps going in the amateur quits.

Liz Stapleton [00:35:11]:
Yeah, I like that. Again thank you for taking the time, everyone should go check out your site, goinswriter.com, correct? Definitely go pick up one of his books if not all of them, because the are fantastic.

Jeff Goins [00:35:22]:
Oh, thanks.

Liz Stapleton [00:35:24]:
you know, I I really I do reference it. It's one of my favorite favorite books that I kind of if I need a little note of inspiration, I'd go to one of the dog ear pages. so so thank you again. I really appreciate it.

Jeff Goins [00:35:22]:
My pleasure. Thanks, Elizabeth.

**Transcript:**
[00:00:09.430] - Liz Stapleton, Summit Host
All right, guys, today I'm really excited to have Kim Doyle with us talking about content creation. I love her planner. Kim, thank you so much for being here. Can you tell us a little bit about yourself in case someone hasn't heard of you before?

[00:00:23.080] - Kim Doyle, kimdoyal.com
Yes. Well, first of all, thank you for having me. So, I am formally known as a WordPress chick. I was WordPress for about ten years, pivoted to my personal brand a few years ago and really fell in love. I've sort of- not accidental entrepreneur, but had no intention of getting into WordPress and building websites. And I was just kind of on a mission to find something I could do from home. And so fast forward almost 13 years and I have my personal brand Kim Doyle.com. And we've got the content creators planner that was an idea that wouldn't let go of me a couple of years ago. And I reached out to my business partner, who is a graphic designer and brilliant and talented with so many things. I'm like, ""You want to do this with me?"" It's like, ""I'm in, let's do it."" And we went from idea to fruition in like four months. So, you know, it's been a fun ride. I've done all different types of content, all types of marketing and really feel like I'm in a super sweet spot right now. Like I feel super grounded when I'm doing.

[00:01:12.770] - Liz
Good. That's awesome, because I think, you know, we hear over and over again you just got to keep pumping out content. Right? Pinterest wants fresh pins and Google will take notice when you publish this much or whatnot and it's, you know, go, go, go and be on Instagram and do stories. And it's just like it's non stop. And people run themselves in the ground, which is the opposite reason why they started their own business or their own blogs.

[00:01:12.770] - Kim
Absolutely.

[00:01:36.640] - Liz
So, can you tell us kind of your approach to content and what should people drop in  sense?

[00:01:44.410] - Kim
I honestly drop anything you don't enjoy doing and I mean that with every ounce of my being. So, my approach to content, I created this hashtag ""everything is content"" because it is. And I've done all gamete. First of all, every content that I do that I enjoy doing works and it blows up because I'm having fun doing it. I started a Podcast in 2013, so I wanted to have more fun. It was one of the best things I did for my business. Relationships. I got coaching clients, I got Web clients. I mean, it was crazy because I had fun doing. It was very easy to develop this consistent connection piece. And I love Podcast because it's an intimate content. I think if someone's willing to take me in their ears for like an hour, I'm like, they're they're my ideal tribe. So, I do believe everything is content and picking what you like, but at the same time, like, I really think organic reach is a lot harder on social, not saying not to have a presence. I'm on every platform. I push all my content there. I engage. I like to. I just don't have the bandwidth. And so what works for me- and I'm also, you know, you see a lot of people who start Facebook groups are going all in on Instagram, DMs and stuff. And I had a call with the coaching client yesterday and she's like, she's doing all this manual posting and DMing and Messenger. And I was like, ""You got to stop it. It's just it's not sustainable."" And she's gotten clients from it. But if you can deploy a little bit of patience, I mean, your best bet is to develop content on assets you own, share from there, but always be driving people back to your website, a place you can get your name and email address, something that's going to support your business goals, not just pushing noise at people.

[00:03:14.740] - Liz
Yeah, Okay. So, you say you still push your content out. Are you doing that via some sort of automated automation or automated tool?

[00:03:25.150] - Kim
Yeah. So we use Co Schedule for both site, my personal brand and a planner, but I also use Missing Letter and so I schedule that stuff out and then I mean, I log into to and I pay attention to alerts, but I just I'm not- I've got a Facebook group that's almost 7000 people. So, I'm in there having conversations, you know, but it's like I've got like over 20,000 followers on Twitter, I retweet stuff, but I'm never on Twitter having conversations. And I'm not anti social media at all, but there's only so much time in the day and I get a better return on email and Podcast. So I do it.

[00:03:59.930] - Liz
Yeah and those are the ones you enjoy, right? I

[00:04:01.660] - Kim
Yeah.

[00:04:01.750] - Liz
If you try to present everything, he'd never actually get around to doing anything on your business. Right.

[00:04:07.450] - Kim
I'm like, I need time to work. So I was I'm like, I got to shut Facebook bye.

[00:04:12.610] - Liz
Okay, so. How often would you say, like, is there some sort of magic formula if you should post at least one blog post a week, or is there what kind of is your approach to that?

[00:04:25.510] - Kim
One piece of content a week is great on again, starting on your site, whether it's your Podcast, because, you know, there's a lot of new ways to Podcast it. But I have my feed generated from my site. I've been doing it so long so I also create a post. Anything that you can do from your site I would start with. And even if you're going to do if you're all in with video and you've got a great YouTube channel, I would do the video, but I would still create a blog post on your site. So, once a week, maybe twice a month- excuse me, once a week or twice a month even. I think you need to start. You need to start. And consistency looks very different. You know, there are some people that can write two or three times a week or there's times where I go through and I do like daily emails. It's a story based email, I'll publish those as blog post often. And so, you know, if you're not doing this and you're trying to come up with a structure and a framework, you have to really be real with yourself and say, what can I be consistent with? And if that's twice a month, do twice a month. And then you make sure to email and to share. You know, it's a lot better to create quality content that you can repurpose and share and get some leverage from as opposed to just pushing out forty  five hundred. Yeah. Yeah, exactly.

[00:05:33.310] - Liz
Gotcha. And quality content is usually going to be longer. It's going to get more SEO juice. There are a lot of benefits to that. So, you talk about repurposing. Would you can you give us some examples of how you would repurpose, like if you worked really hard in a blog post, how would you what would your next steps be? How would you repurpose that so that, again, you're not working yourself into the ground? Work smarter, not harder is my my favorite.

[00:05:56.740] - Kim
You know what my business partner Jodi she's an essential, she's really got me into that, too. So, I mean, there's like micro content that you push to social. So I think absolutely setting that up and sharing that out. But if you do a blog post and you want it to be easy, I love Audiograms. What there's a headliner app or, you know, even Anchor will let you record up to two minutes with transcriptions and you create a video file. So, I would find another type of media that you can create from the post and test that as well and start where you get traction. You know, you mentioned Pinterest earlier on and we had hired someone she was great at to manage the Pinterest count. I did it for my brand and the planner and it was great. She was putting out tons, but the traffic to the site was minimal.

[00:06:39.640] - Liz
Yeah.

[00:06:40.240] - Kim
So it's like I'm working on I'm going to go all in where I'm paying attention and getting the data. So in terms of repurposing, pick one or two other types of media that I do, I think that's ideal.

[00:06:50.920] - Liz
Okay, and there's like if you're not particularly, you know, if you're camera shy or if you're, you know, nervous about recording a Podcast, they're actually tools that will kind of take your blog post and turn it into a video that's like an image and text thing you know, there is stuff you could do like that. So I just I don't want people to be like ""I have to get on camera."" Podcasting is great, though, because you don't have to do it with video or you could. I actually record my Podcast with video and then I put the video on YouTube.

[00:07:16.360] - Kim
It's funny and I thought about doing that, but I'm like, ""I don't want to have to get ready all the time."" So, you know... And I'm also at a point where it's like unless it's something that I can sustain and I see a real solid strategy, I don't do it. What I will say to people who don't like being on video or hearing their voice or something, you're not going to get comfortable doing it unless you do it.

[00:07:32.710] - Liz
Yeah.

[00:07:33.160] - Kim
And I think if you can provide- it's kind of like when you have a course, it's great to have a video, it's great to have an audio and it's great to have transcripts. We all learn in different modalities. And so I would recommend, you know, stick with something you know really well. And then can you create a stretch goal? Can you say I'm just going to get comfortable listening to or hearing, my voice or something? You know?

[00:07:52.060] - Liz
Yeah, I record my Podcast because I also don't do makeup very often and mine are also really short and I've started doing where I do like little snippets from the Summit actually as like a teaser in a preview and stuff you learned, you know. So, I really don't have to do much for my podcast.

[00:08:11.950] - Kim
Yes. Mine are an hour long. And it's like, Okay.

[00:08:15.590] - Liz
But, yeah, it kind of just depends on what your goal of it is. Right. So you also mentioned sort of data analysis, because I think that is so crucial. You know, when people are trying to be everywhere, they're not taking the time to figure out what's actually working. How do you go about you using Google Analytics? Are you pulling something into a spreadsheet, some tool to help you see it all? What- how your approach to figuring out what content and content networks are working?

[00:08:40.510] - Kim
Well, Google Analytics for sure. It's a big one. We run paid traffic also for the content creators banner. So, we're looking at that consistently. And Jodi is brilliant with spreadsheets. And we pull all of that because when you're spending money, you really want to look at the data and drill down, not to mention, is the tracking correct? You know, it's funny for my personal brand I do Google Analytics and I've got a plug in in the back of the site where I can look at it. I can't stand logging into Google Analytics, to be honest with you. And then I look at Podcast downloads and the biggest factor is leads. How many leads am I getting and am- I am I driving subscribers and whatnot? And so that's a big one. And so you don't necessarily have to be a data nerd. You don't like- I hate spreadsheets. I hate them. But, you know, you have to measure what's working and I pay. It's like I launched a newsletter and I am obsessed with newsletters lately. We have one for the planner. I feel like there's this rebirth, it's aggregated content, it's value, it's intimate. And so I'm looking at doing the referral program for that. So, I'm already getting the feedback on the newsletter. So, now how do I build in a referral program that I can start generating quality leads from that? So, it's really taking a look at what you like doing, what's working and then drilling down. How can you make it work better? You don't have to keep adding stuff. Can you take what's working and make it work better? And oftentimes you can.

[00:09:54.910] - Liz
Yeah, yeah. That's actually what I'm doing. We're recording this in December and end of year and I'm looking at my processes and I'm like, ""Oh, I could do that. I don't need to, you know, that can be automated. This can do that. And that's so much easier."" And, you know, I think you've got to be intentional about that. So, we're talking, Okay, you don't need to create as much content. You need to create quality content and then repurpose it. How much time would you say should- I mean, everyone's a little bit different- I know this is an impossible question- but how much time would you say would recommend putting into a piece of content? You know, what does the final result of quality content look like, I guess is probably a better question?

[00:10:36.580] - Kim
Well, the final result, I mean, SEO does play a huge factor in it, right at the same time, I will tell you with my personal brand, I- right- what I've been doing this long enough. I've got an audience and so I do what I want to do, which was really the intention of flipping to the personal brand. We are much more conscientious about SEO on the planner. And so at the same time, I'm also weary of doing all of this. How to do this and how to do that. It's like you buy our plan or if you want to know how to do that. So, there's a fine line between- and I'm just being super like, this is business. We all need to make money. And this provides massive value for, you know, forever. And there's- there's a balance you have to find in there. And so the length of time it takes- I mean, I can spend an entire day on a Podcast for myself because I write two thousand plus word post and then I've got an hour to record it and then I've got to do the post optimization. But I get a lot doing it and I get a ton of leverage from that. And so maybe sort of an epic post. I'll tell you Jody did- we did this marketing checkup and it's gotten Google sheets and stuff link to it. It's like a 5000 word post. It took her a good month.

[00:11:43.170] - Liz
Yeah.

[00:11:43.660] - Kim
To do the research, to write the post and then you go in and you've got to get it. So, it depends on your skill set and it depends on how- are you good at writing? Do you like... There's so many factors that go into it, but I think people just need to be willing to do what it takes. I honestly, I'll tell you, it is easy to succeed in this space if you're willing to stick it out. So many people quit because they think they're supposed to be somewhere in three months, six months. I've been doing this a year, it's like try thirteen. Yeah, it's unless you've got deep pockets for paid traffic or to hire experts, there's a learning curve. Master the craft and you'll enjoy the journey a lot more.

[00:12:17.860] - Liz
Yeah. And I always say, if you're kind of if you've been doing it consistently for a year, you'll- you'll get there, you know, that first year the hardest. But if you- you know, and then I think also even five thousand word post like that done is better than perfect. You can always go back and edit things later. Like that's my motto is that is done is better than perfect. Just get it out there.

[00:12:34.900] - Kim
Imperfect action all the time. I'm right there with you.

[00:12:38.410] - Liz
Okay, so you know, and I think that that speaks volumes of it. It makes you want to write a massive, incredible post. It's five thousand words and you're only posting once  a month it's fine. Like if that's kind of where you want to be, like Google going to eat up five word posts, a lot better than seventeen five hundred workers.

[00:12:55.600] - Kim
Absolutely. Nice math. Yeah, absolutely. You know.

[00:12:58.600] - Liz
It's 10,500 posts. But let's just say you really are publishing multiple times a week, right.

[00:13:03.790] - Kim
Yeah. It absolutely is, and the other thing is, like we're talking about repurposing, if you're going to go to the trouble, if writing is a good space for you, I mean, medium is a golden opportunity. Still, I pay for medium. I subscribe to it. I get so much great content and I don't mean this dismissively. I like all mediums of content, but I feel that people that read medium or subscribe to newsletters, can tend to be a higher quality lead. Not negating the person, but a higher quality lead if they're willing to take the time to read, to be honest with you.

[00:13:35.910] - Liz
Yeah, so if you're in the space of trying to offer a service, then that's a great way to go about it. You know, if you're doing a small digital product, you know, it's going to vary. But if you hate writing, don't or do like dictation. If you're better at talking. Like, I've actually busted out lots of long post- entire courses just by doing dictation and not even the fancy tool, just like Google Docs microphone.

[00:13:59.190] - Kim
Yeah, totally. Totally.

[00:14:01.560] - Liz
Yeah. Okay, so what other advice do you have for people struggling to keep up with content wheel I guess. Well I think you cut it. This is going to be a little bit, I don't know, draw a line in the sand. There comes a point where you have to say, ""I can't do it all."" You have to. I think there's a level of self responsibility that people miss because they see other people, what they're doing. And it's like you don't you have no idea. You know, we see the winds. We see this highlight reels. We see what's happening. You've no idea how much time and energy was put into what you're seeing. And so I think you have to draw a line in the sand and make a commitment in terms of what can I do, what can I realistically be consistent with? And it's all the stuff that's not sexy, right? I mean, being consistent with writing emails is not necessarily sexy, but it's friggin works.

[00:14:46.800] - Kim
And so, like the other thing I would recommend because and I wish I had done this because truly we we make money. Every single email we sell, email marketing works. And, you know, there's so many different ways to do this. But I want people to pay attention to what are their business goals and are they creating assets because all of your audience is on social. You own them? Not at all. You know, so you have to really develop that relationship. The other piece in terms of the content overwhelm and it sounds esoteric, but you have to do what you enjoy.

[00:15:16.980] - Kim
You're not going to stick with something if it if you hate it at the same time, you're not going to get good at something by not doing it.

[00:15:23.310] - Liz
True.

[00:15:23.770] - Kim
Yeah.

[00:15:24.000] - Liz
So something there's a difference between hating it and something that's outside your comfort zone.

[00:15:27.840] - Kim
Yeah.

[00:15:28.450] - Liz
You're like that's kind of what we're talking about here, but like you're uncomfortable doing it, keep doing it. If you're like ""I hate this"", walk away.

[00:15:35.790] - Kim
Yeah. Well, and I also think, you know, it's funny because the one thing I've said to people like if  I could recommend one thing to anybody, it would it is to get good at writing.

[00:15:43.740] - Liz
And I'm not talking about the next great novel. I'm talking about writing that gets people to take an action. I mean copywriting. I hated copy and I've kind of fallen in love with it over the last couple of years. So, you know, as an example, there's a story behind by Donald Miller Jody. I spent six hours on the Zoom developing our story brand for the content creators final before we launched it. We have never had to revisit what this looks like, like it's solid copy.

[00:16:09.240] - Kim
We put copy from the site all the time from our ads we've done all the time because we took the time to do that. So you have to. And that's hard when it's not a comfort level. But there is a simple headline can make or break a course launch completely. And so when you start looking at how words impact people's actions, consume your content to opt in, to buy whatever it gets exciting. They get sexy.

[00:16:34.080] - Liz
It does. It does. And we do have sessions on copyright people should check out and Story Brand is an excellent book. I read it. Okay, so how do you because I mean, you have an amazing planner. How do you approach planning content then? Right. Because you don't necessarily know that that 5000 word post going to take you a month. How do you approach kind of planning what you want your content to be towards your goals?

[00:16:55.860] - Kim
Well, we we approach it from what can I- so we've got business goals. Right. And that's how the planner works. But it's then what content supports reaching those that really comes back to that. And here's what is is fascinating to me, which with work. So, we have this newsletter that we put out, Creativity Publishers Weekly, and we publish a new post and there's two of us. Right. So, we alternate over the week.

[00:17:16.050] - Liz
Yeah.

[00:17:16.380] - Kim
But what's been interesting and because I've really made a conscious point of I'm not going to do massive how to content, when the how to is what they should hire us for or buy our product from.

[00:16:55.860] - Liz
Yeah.

[00:17:26.580] - Kim
But there's relationship content and there's teaching a little bit. So what we do is it we can be consistent with. So we do a post every week, we do the newsletter every week and that's that's great content. We want to do a Podcast for the planner. We'll get there. We've done a couple of false starts of it. Just don't- we both have our own businesses too. So, in terms of planning of a content strategy, start with tangible, measurable goals. I want to add three hundred subscribers to my list this week. I want to book five coaching sessions, whatever it is.

[00:17:54.810] - Liz
Yeah.

[00:17:55.110] - Kim
What content supports...

[00:17:56.580] - Liz
Work backwards.

[00:17:57.120] - Kim
Right. Work backwards. Yeah.

[00:17:58.770] - Liz
Yeah. Because you don't want to be publishing content just to publish content. I mean you can maybe at first as you're getting traction on your site to get that Google SEO and all that stuff, but really do it with a goal in mind, whether that's an affiliate link click or like you said, subscribe to your newsletter signing up for a service or product, because even if you're a beginner, have some sort of strategy coming in with your content. Don't just- I mean, I didn't when I started, but learn from my mistakes, right?

[00:18:26.140] - Kim
Yeah, yeah. That's how you that's how you learn. And the other piece of that, though, I will say I write a lot of content just because I feel like it on my brand, because I've been at this a long time. I've got an audience, I've got an email list. And so sometimes there is that opinion piece that can resonate with people as well. So I don't want people to think that- one of my best posts has nothing to do with SEO or content at all.

[00:18:50.490] - Liz
Yeah,

[00:18:50.730] - Kim
It had to do with a personal story and it was something people didn't know. And it was it got the most comments, the most shares, the most traffic. And so but so there's a lot of ways that your content can serve your audience. So, you know, don't be afraid to just write an opinion piece because you've got a thought on something as long as it supports your business, your brand and provides value. Yeah, no, I think that's a great point.

[00:19:14.580] - Liz
Again, on my first site that I started, which is still around, which as been a little dormant lately. Like my most popular content is how I don't like the other. It's a personal finance, how I don't like this other personal finance approach that's out there. And like people are like, you don't want to attract everyone. That's not going to work for you. So, make sure you shine through with your opinion and your personality. I do that in my emails on my site and my like footers where I'm like, ""Hey, these are causes I support."" And you don't necessarily have to be that, you know, in-depth or political necessarily, you know, because I know there is a lot of divisiveness there. But you can say, you know, ""I don't like this. This is just my approach. And if you're you know, there's nothing wrong with that. That's just not my cup of tea."" You can kind of move on from there.

[00:20:01.530] - Kim
Absolutely. There's a there was a quote, I think, of Danielle Porton, and she said, ""Love me, hate me, but don't be..."" excuse me. ""don't be indifferent.""

[00:20:10.260] - Liz
Yes.

[00:20:11.040] - Kim
And so because I'll tell you what, it's very easy to draw a big list of just random people. And it all comes back to that one thousand true fans. I'd rather have a thousand true fans than one hundred thousand who are indifferent.

[00:20:21.990] - Liz
Yeah. Who don't care. That's why you shouldn't do like giveaways of like twenty five dollar Amazon card. You could get a hundred thousand subscribers that way, but it's not really going to do you any good. Yeah.

[00:20:31.390] - Kim
It's like a BuzzFeed quiz. It's like just don't.

[00:20:34.350] - Liz
Yes. Okay, so any- I mean I feel like we're kind of covered a lot of really good points. Do you have some specific examples of kind of taking parts of content and using them elsewhere? I know you said you can make a video, but do you do that with your whole piece of content? Do you do snippets? Are you doing just the conclusion? Can you kind of get into some of the nitty gritty?

[00:20:31.390] - Kim
A little bit? Yeah. So when I go to schedule stuff, I will pull out text. I mean, with Kosko Tool missing letter, I try to bury the text in the images all year long campaign for that. So, I mean that's really that's kind of it. I just pull out different snippets. I don't go is Grayndler. I'd like to do one of the things I want to do with a test and just create one really piece of good content and see what happens when you dedicate thirty days to giving it the leverage it needs. And in that case, then it would I would record a separate audio if it's not a Podcast effort episode, recorded separate audio, maybe do a talking head video really quick, driving people back to the post and then a handful of social images. Again, it depends on where you're at in your journey and how much traffic you have to your site and your email. I mean, don't misuse- not misuse. Don't forget that email. I mean, always drive people back to your content creator email, you know, so it's it's one of those things that you have to be in a place where it's share it on places that you engage. So, the granular details of how you do that, it depends on how well you've written a post, because sometimes you can copy and paste a paragraph and put it in social sharing and there's no context. It doesn't make sense. You're going to edit it and tweak it. So, micro content pushing socially is like phase two of creating the content and, you know, and so I would just like people to realize it's a long game. Content is a long game.

[00:22:16.740] - Kim
The other piece not to miss. So, if you're going to go to the trouble to write a two to five thousand word post that provides massive value, put some money behind it and send traffic to it with an opt-in I mean, don't be afraid to test that to see if that resonates. Paid traffic from Facebook to an opt in is a lot cheaper than to a sales page. And and so you need to get some of those little wins. And yet you see people buying two thousand dollar courses. I'm like, ""spend two thousand dollars on ads.""

[00:22:42.480] - Liz
Yeah.

[00:22:43.780] - Kim
And I'm not saying there's not a time and a place, but the bottom line is, like everything works, webinars work, videos work, but you have to get good at one or two, get them working and then decide if you want to add another vehicle.

[00:22:55.720] - Liz
Yeah, shiny object syndrome can be a downfall and something that really slows your progress. Like, yes, you want to invest in yourself and learning and shortening that learning curve. But there's there's a fine line. You know, no amount of tools are going to make up for the fact that you haven't written a post in two months. No, amount.

[00:23:12.860] - Kim
Exactly. Yeah, I had a friend who was like, ""Oh, my list is a bust"", because she went to email her list, this course that she's had out for a year and a half or whatever. And I'm like, "" When was the last time you emailed them."" Yeah. Has it been this year because they're cold? They haven't heard from you. They're not going to buy your course when you haven't communicated with them, so. So logic, but I kind of think that the shiny object syndrome is sort of like the movie tax that people pay. I think we've all been through that. Right. And then you get to the point where it's like, ""I don't have time to go through anymore courses. So until I finish this one, I don't care how appealing this is. I'm not spending a penny on it.""

[00:23:49.500] - Liz
Yeah, yeah. No, no, that's a great point. Oh my gosh. The number of courses I have is ridiculous. And like and I've done. I went through period for like a year or two where I just was constantly, you know, I was taking them. But some of these courses depending, they're like I literally there was one course that I spent a good chunk of money on. It took me a year to get through that course, working on it consistently, you know. So recognize what? You're not just investing money. You have to invest the time. And so if you are short on time already, keep that in mind. So, I think absolutely a good point. You can still totally get one of the upgrade passes to the Summit because we've got a session for beginner intermediate level. So, it'll grow with you. But if you have like one hundred other courses that you want to get through, maybe hold off, well that's kay. But yeah, Okay. So we've covered a good amount of stuff I think would hopefully help people adjust their mindset and expectations of what they can do. You don't have to do everything, do what works right. Like if you only focus on two channels and that's like SEO and social like that's fine. So, any final tips before we tell them about something you've got for them? But any final tips?

[00:25:00.680] - Kim
Have fun with it you guys, seriously, content is not this. And I get it there are people that a chiropractor is like, ""I'm a chiropractor. I want to create content, hire somebody that likes to create content."" And, you know, but it's just this is not supposed to be- I don't know if people take themselves too seriously. It's so much better to show up and be consistent and get the data and figure out what works. I mean, you get clarity through the doing. So just do it,

[00:25:23.480] - Liz
Okay? Yes. And then can you tell us what you have or the link is below, but tell you want to tell them about it?

[00:25:29.840] - Kim
Yeah, it's a free workshop. It's called Seven Ways to Create a create, promote and profit with your content. So, it's an hour long training, but there's tons of tangible examples of different types of content. The different set, the seven steps that will incorporate if your idea stuck with it's funny, like entrepreneurs are never lacking ideas, but when it comes to content, it's kind of like, what do I do? So, it'll really walk you through that whole process.

[00:25:52.070] - Liz
Okay, awesome. Definitely. Go check that out you  guys can thank you so much for being here again. Like I said, I do love your planner. Everyone should go check that out too it's a fantastic one. Just again, thank you so much for being here. I appreciate it.

[00:26:06.290] - Kim
Thanks for having me this. Great.

**Transcript:**
[00:00:00.000] - Liz Stapleton, Host
All right, guys. I'm really excited for this session with Lanie, from lanielammare.com. Lanie, thank you so much for being here. I really appreciate it.

[00:00:06.420] - Lanie Lammare
I appreciate you having me.

[00:00:08.330] - Liz 
Yeah, because I'm excited for your session because I know you're a big Airtable fan, as am I. Airtable and ClickUp are my two go-twos. So can you tell us a little bit about your background and what you're going to be teaching us today?

[00:00:22.250] - Lanie
I think it's really kind that you call us Airtable fans because really, we're nerds. Anyone who sort of loves a spreadsheet just sees a spreadsheet and falls in love with it has to fall in the nerd category. However, you don't have to be a nerd to appreciate it. In fact, I think that Airtable is really well suited to people who are creative thinkers because you tend to start to plan in a way where you just keep adding things to your to-do list, and you don't make them accountable to the goals that you set for yourself, or the vision that you have for yourself, and if you use Airtable in the way that I teach it, it can help you really start to think and plan, and add on to your to-do list things that will actually get you ahead. So if you're creating content, create content that's going to either grow your list or make you sales. Every time you hit publish, that's the goal of your content, right? Not the brilliant idea, not the thing that you really have to share with everybody, but when you're in business it's about aligning those things to each other so I use Airtable in that way, and that's how I'm teaching it in our tutorial today.

[00:01:28.310] - Liz
Yeah. Before everyone stresses out, Airtable is free.

[00:01:31.040] - Lanie
Oh yeah.

[00:01:31.230] - Liz
If you're not familiar with it and you're like, Oh my God, I'm just going to be told to go buy another product, especially in the blogging niche I feel like it's spend the cash. And yes, there are great resources like the ""All Acces Pass"" is a great investment you know and there's a side to investing and getting a return on that investment but Airtable is an amazing tool that's free.

[00:01:52.100] - Lanie
Yeah, and I approached it with that thought too, right? The idea that we're using the free version. And if you want to upgrade, like if you start nerding out hard and you decide that you're really into all the extra bells and whistles, cool beans, go for it. But absolutely, yes, start with the free stuff so that you can even see if it resonates with you.

[00:02:12.860] - Liz
Yeah, exactly. Which is why Airtable, they're my go-to. It just blows my mind that they're free. So let's go ahead and dive in. I'm excited about this because I know not all my content accomplishes this goal of getting them on my list or buying products so I'm excited to see what you have to say, so let's go to it.

[00:02:32.270] - Lanie
This ""Content Creation and Calendar Airtable Base"" is like the one repository to rule them all. We've got here, just as a quick look at the tables, we have ""Content Creation"" (things you're actively working on), ""Content Library"" (everything you've already published), ""As Featured In"" (other people's stuff that you were published on), and ""Offers"" (this is going to be whether those are paid or freebies), and you're going to see how all of this ties in together but it's really all of your creation stuff under one roof. And it all starts with this table here: ""Your Messaging."" There are only two fields for you to fill in here. There's going to be the messaging field and your philosophy. All of the other ones you can see are linked to your other tables and I'll talk about that in just one second, but I do want to talk about your messaging.

[00:03:15.550] - Lanie
Every great brand has some messaging, philosophies, beliefs that they promote, usually about two to five of them. I want you to go ahead and list whatever it is that your message, that your brand is trying to communicate. What kind of beliefs and philosophies keep it such that you are on brand? Then you can go ahead and build out your philosophy here. If you want a little bit more information about things related to brand stories and connecting with customers through the way you communicate, this book has been hands down one of my personal favorites. It's called: ""Building a Story Brand: Clarify your message so customers will listen."" This is just the little book synopsis from Amazon. But this one definitely delivers when it comes to speaking about your business and who you are and what you do. Highly recommend!

[00:03:59.480] - Lanie
Now, as far as these fields being connected to those other tables, you kind of get a pulled-back view on the content you've been creating. Where does it all fall, which messages does it fall under, is one message getting more attention than the other, are you not promoting a specific message enough? This table will deliver all that information at a bird's-eye view because all of your content is connected to those messages.

[00:04:20.490] - Lanie
Let's go and see how that works by starting with the  ""Content Creation Table"". So here are your ""Content Titles"". Let's say we have a genius idea. We're going to go ahead and work through this ""Genius idea number 785"". And the ""Content-Type""? Maybe we want to create a blog post, YouTube, newsletter, podcast, free resources. It's completely up to you and will depend on the type of content that you generally do create. But let's say this is a genius idea I have for my podcast.

[00:04:49.230] - Lanie
So what's the purpose of creating content? It's to reinforce your message. Okay, but why do you want to reinforce your message? Well, it's because this is what your business is built on. So the end goal is always to collect on one of two things: people's contact information so that you can further educate them about what you're all about, or to offer them a paid product that will help them with whatever it is they came to your content for in the first place. So I like to be able to include a lead magnet, an opt-in, a resource that is like a supporting document to whatever it is that you created. So you can go ahead and add this content ""Genius idea 785"" will relate to freebie number two. You'll find those in the offers area, but we'll see those in a second and it reinforces message-two from that first table that we were looking at.

[00:05:34.660] - Lanie
I love how it forces you to acknowledge whether your content is actually on brand to your messaging because you can have a great idea that isn't at all related to your business, and then you waste a lot of time creating really great content that again, isn't really aligned with what your big message is. I like that this is sort of a check or reaffirmation that, yes, this is A-okay to be bringing into your world.

[00:05:57.020] - Lanie
Now, is this scheduled, published content, is this a work in progress, is this something that I'm currently recording, or is this just an idea? We're going to go with idea. When you're creating content, it might not be all about you. You might have a team working on this, in which case the people with whom you've shared the board, they will be identified as collaborators. I've done it in other videos where I have a separate table for ""Contacts"", but you can also do it in this way as well. You can see the cute little faces of the people with whom you're working. Let's go scroll down a little bit here. So you have the publishing date, the date that content should be going out into the world, created by, when do you need it written by, when do you need it done, because if you're batching your content creation it's great to be able to have future publishing dates and have a bunch of stuff created by a specific date.

[00:06:41.590] - Lanie
Since there are stages to content creation, I've gone ahead and created check marks. So has it been created, has it been edited, have the graphics been created? Here is a ""attachment field"" where you can save those graphics, and has it been scheduled? If you're working from a Google Doc, you can go ahead and put the link in there so that everyone who is actively working on it has the direct link to that content.

[00:07:06.350] - Lanie
I'm going to go back to the beginning of this table here. What I like to do is I like to group this by ""Content-Type"". This way you can easily see your blog posts, your YouTube stuff, your newsletter stuff. It kind of divides it in a better way. If you wanted to create this as its own view, you would go ahead and add view: ""Grid"". We're going to add this as ""Content-Type View"", and we're going to group that. Let's go ahead and create another grid view, and we're going to create a grid view based on the ""Status"" and this way, we'll be able to see what's an idea, what are we actually working on, what hasn't been attributed a status yet.

[00:07:49.220] - Lanie
On to ""Content Library"". You'll notice these first few columns, these first few fields look the same. That's been done on purpose so that when you have something like this one that has already been scheduled, you can just go ahead and copy those first three lines, ""Copy"". Then go back over here and we'll paste it and it will show up exactly the same as it was and then you can add your publishing date and you can [singing 00:08:14] get the URL to where that content was published, your graphics and so on and so forth. So that way you can have a working library. You can maybe even see, oh man, I've got a bunch of content promoting message-one, but nothing with message-two or even freebie-two. You're better equipped to balance out the content that you're creating. So let's go ahead and group this by, ""reinforces the message"". And so we would see here that there's a count of two for message-one. If we had a bunch of content and we would see that we have 20 pieces of content for message-one, but only five for message- two, you can sort of see how that needs to be a bit more balanced.

[00:08:47.850] - Lanie
Let's go back to that ""Content Creation"". You would be able to then go ahead and right-click and delete record. So once something has been scheduled or published, it doesn't have to be in the work in progress anymore. I'm going to go back here since we're already back in this ""Content Creation"". I've got to show you the other views that we've got. So your calendar - you can see how your content is slid over your month. You might want to move things around so that it's a little bit more balanced as to when your publishing dates are. And then your ""Gallery View"". If you wanted to look at them as individual cards this way, and you can also look at it in a ""Kanban View"" that would group it by ""Content-Type"" or ""Status"". Let's go ahead with ""Content-Type"". You can see it by ""Content-Type"" and you can change that here and then go to ""Status"" and see the status once here. You can start to see how useful the different views are. ""Content Library Views"" is much the same. We have the ""Calendar"" (when things were published), ""Gallery View with Cards"", and we're going to go to the ""Kanban View"" (where it divides it into blog posts and YouTube videos, et cetera). ""As Featured In"", I'm willing to bet that you could have guessed that this looks much the same as the others.

[00:09:54.330] - Lanie
Something I didn't mention in the other videos, especially for the ""Content Library"" in this one, is that having that URL here, that link to directly to a specific piece of content can be really handy instead of having to go back to your website and copy and pasting the link and forwarding it to someone. Everything is just at your fingertips right here. And finally your offers. Your offers are content, whether they are free or paid resources. And I really do recommend that you create a library for these, for multiple reasons. One, you can always relate these offers back to the content you're creating. You can always see how it's all enmeshed together, how it all works as one cohesive entity. And I don't know about you, but good Lord do I hate searching for links for everything. So for freebie-one, we see we have the opt-in page link, so the actual sales page, if you will, where people would land to sign up for that specific offer. The codes to embed into your post, whether that's a pop-up or sign-up form, whatever it is that you embed into a post to promote that freebie, keep that handy. And, also direct links to that actual resource. Sometimes I want to look over my own freebie content, but then I have to go into my email marketing and then download the link from there, that's crazy! Just keep it all in one spot and this is the perfect spot to do it. Now, samesies goes for your paid offers. You would have a link to your sales page. You would have some details about what those paid offers are: cost, duration of service, how many are available, when they become available, details about payment schedules, and things of that nature.

[00:11:19.750] - Lanie
You'll see as we go down here, some images that promote the freebies, the offers, and the content that relates to those offers. So let's say you have content related to a specific paid offer, you would be able to recycle some of that content or maybe just get an active inventory of what you already have out there that's related to that offer. But you see how this web all ties right back into that first one that we were on where your related content that's: work in progress, your offers, your featured content, and the content you've already created all relate back to your big brand message. So that's your ""Content Creation and Calendar Airtable Base.""

[00:11:57.920] - Lanie
There are approximately one gazillion ways to plan a quarter but with my way, with the Airtable method that I'm going to show you, you're not just planning your quarter. You are creating goals that you will constantly be accountable to, that you will not be able to ignore if you're doing work or taking on tasks that are not directly related to accomplishing the things that you set out to accomplish. This is less about the ""to-do list""  and way more about the ""to-be list"". What are you trying to become? What are you trying to create? And always, always keeping your eye on that prize.

[00:12:28.890] - Lanie
So where are we going to start with? We're going to start in the ""Start Here Column."" [laughs]. Before we get started, let's explain a couple of things. These rows that you would normally call a row, these are called fields with Airtable. And if you click down here, you can customize the field type. And you'll see here that this little icon indicates that it's a drop-down menu. This is what the type of field this is that we're dealing with. And I've already populated this with ""Create New Program"", ""Create A Challenge"" to promote the program, ""Run an Ad Campaign"" to the challenge, and ""Pre-sell"" the program. These are the things, the focuses that I want this quarter to be focused on. So if you want to change anything, you could pre-sell the wholly heck out of the program, and if you wanted to add something you would just go ahead and do that enter button. Hit it hard! See how easy it is to edit, remove. If you wanted to switch places for things, that's pretty easy to do as well. You have colored options, but you can also just do grayscale. So that's a quick view on how you can manage these options that you've got in front of you here.

[00:13:27.220] - Lanie
Let's go ahead and get started and select that first one. We want to create a new program that's part of our quarterly goals, it's part of our quarterly plans. I want you to list out all of the sort of modular ways of thinking about creating a new program. Like if you were to write a table of contents or create a course on creating a new program, what would the chapters of these be? That's what I want you to be writing in this area. So for instance, creating a new program, what would you have to do? You'd have to outline the program and you'd have to create the dang thing. So those are the kind of big-picture things that we would do. Please note that this works a lot like an Excel sheet with that little triangle in the corner. You could go ahead and drag and drop it so you don't have to type the same thing over and over again. So let's say that's everything that will go into creating a new program.

[00:14:10.800] - Lanie
Let's go ahead and write everything that's going to go into creating the challenge to promote the new program. So the first thing is we're going to have to map out the challenge; we're going to write the daily emails to support the challenge, and we're going to create the worksheets for the daily emails. So you kind of get the idea of how this works. You would do that for each and every one of the big goals that you were going after, and then the big-picture things that have to happen in order for those things to become a reality. Now I'm not going to do all of these because the important thing here is to have the example to see how this works. So let's keep rolling over into the other fields. This one here you'll see is a multiple drop-down field, which means that you can select more than one option. Here you could only select one, but now you can select a couple of them. This field might not be of interest to you. That's totally up to you, but I left it there in case it is. I like it because it allows me to see how I'm dividing my time. Here we're looking at creating a new program is obviously offers, but other things include… Well, in this case, it would be marketing and promotions as well as offers for a new challenge. But see, if you're spending so much time creating offers over the course of a year, let's say, and you can see that by how you're dividing your time, your area of focus, and not as much time on, say, growth and bottom line, kind of a problem, right?

[00:15:29.900] - Lanie
So it's a good way of being accountable to how you're spending your time and energy. What are you focusing on? Like I said, I like it, but if you don't, you can hide it here, or you can hide it up here, or you can just delete it entirely. Totally your call. But something you're definitely going to want is a time frame. So i've already divided these month-one, month-two, month-three. You can specify January, February, March, whatever. But the idea here is to establish what time frame you're going to do these things. And you'll see how this is helpful in a minute. So outline the program, well, that's month-one, and create the dang program. Well, we're going to create it as we go. That's going to be a month-three thing. Mapping out the challenge, again month-one. Write the daily emails to support the challenge. That's going to be a month-two thing because the challenge is going down in month-two. And those worksheets, I'd like to have those done first, actually. So there you go.

[00:16:16.740] - Lanie
You're starting to see how things take shape, but let's give it a little bit more shape by sorting first to last. So let's apply that. Oh, that looks nice, doesn't it? And you could have sorted it up here, but let's group it in an even more comprehensive way. So let's go ahead and group that by ""Time Frame"". And you're starting to see, actually, let's delete this field because this empty field is just going to be in our way. Delete it. There we go. So we see how sexy this is starting to look. It's all coming together where you can really get a bird's-eye view and see your information in different ways.

[00:16:46.000] - Lanie
Let's see an even more different way by clicking that drop-down over here and selecting a different view. It's one of the best parts about Airtable is how many different views they have and here we're going to look at the ""Kanban View"". If this looks familiar, this little icon looks a little bit like the Trello icon, well, it's because the ""Kanban View"" is what Trello is based on. Kanban is a project management term that means looking at all of your resources and making sure that you're distributing them in a way as not to overload any one specific area. And that becomes pretty obvious when we're looking at it through our timeline here. We've got three things going on in month-one and just one in month-two, and month-three. Obviously, you would be able to just move things around. When you're in this view you can really see that you need to reallocate where you're giving your attention, super easy to do. And those changes will also be reflected in that ""Grid View"". Let's go back to the grid view. We weren't quite finished, and we'll roll out [singing 00:17:36] these other fields. So we've got ""Notes"". So this is long-form. You can write really long-form stuff. Long-form stuff forever and ever. And you can see if you expand this, it really does appear in a long-form way. You can also tag somebody who is also on this Airtable base. You can tag them in these ""Notes"" attachments. Well, that's pretty self-explanatory. You can drag and drop files in there, or you can just load it as an attachment like this from any of these types of areas. Let me go ahead and close that.

[00:18:04.300] - Lanie
Now here is where things get interesting. These fields are linked to these tables. So month-one, this one is linked; month-two, this one is linked; month-three, this one is linked. And you'll start to see as we create more records, these fields will start to fill out. So without further ado, let's just keep rolling through. The next table is the ""Contacts Table"". You can always use a collaborator function. I like having a contact table because when you get nice little looksy at everyone who's working on your team, and they will also have all of their tasks located here. So if I'm one of these people, I can just go ahead and log in to my own name to see what is due. That's the ""Gallery View"". But if you went to the ""Grid View"" you would see that it's divided like any grid. So we've got: Jane Doe, name, her zone of genius, email, attachment, contact information, so on and so forth. Let's keep going through to month-one.

[00:18:52.080] - Lanie
So before we get started, I want to draw your attention here to this ""all records are filtered"" bit. We'll talk about it in a minute. First, we're going to start at the...you guessed it. You guessed it because you're good-looking and you're smart! Start here. We're going to click on here what you're working towards. This should look familiar because these are the big-picture tasks that you set out in the first table. So we're going to load up all of the things that we said we wanted to do in month-one because [singing 00:19:15] we are month-one. So we've got all of our big-picture to-do's in month-one and now we're going to write every little detailed task that's going to go into seeing this big-picture thing through. What are we working towards? What are the tasks that we have to complete to see this big- picture thing through that will lead us to accomplishing our goals?  So in ""outlining the program"", let's say, we'll create a sales page. And for ""map out the challenge"" let's say we're going to detail five action items. Now, I'm only writing one thing here just for brevity's sake, but actually, why don't we do something with create worksheets for daily emails? So we'll do: create worksheet one, create worksheet day two, create worksheet for day three. You see, you would write out every single thing that would go into seeing these items through. Then you would give them a due date. So if you wanted to change the format for your dates, you would go into ""customized field type."" I have it listed in this manner. It's my preference because that way when you need to sort It, it will be in numerical order. So, let's go ahead and do 01-01 and 2020-01-15. So we've got some due dates in there.

[00:20:21.600] - Lanie
Let's keep scrolling down. So when something's done, you can check it off as done. You see it's green here and it's green here. The greens match. It's because our filter is for the done stuff. So as soon as you've done the worksheet for day one, you check it and boom, it's gone. So you're only having to see the things that are actually on your tasks, your actionable tasks. The things that have already been done won't be showing up, but you didn't have to delete them either, which I really like.

[00:20:44.910] - Lanie
Now, ""Contact"". This is linked back to your ""Contact Table"" here. So you're able to delegate this to Jane Doe, let's say and this one is, well, I'll take care of that one, the boss lady and then you'll have the InstaGenius will be working on the worksheets. And in fact, on the third day, we're going to have Jane Doe and the InstaGenius collaborating so that when you go back to the contacts area, you can see all the tasks that you have to do here, but you can also go into the grid view and see them in a nicer way here.

[00:21:13.460] - Lanie
We'll go back to that month-one and I'll show you how to set up specialized calendars as well. Let's just finish on seeing what else we have here. So this is also linked. Now, what is this linked to? We can see that it's linked to our ""Tasks to complete"".  So if you have a prerequisite to a task, let's say you can't start work on day two until you finish work on the day one sheet, you can put that there ""Task descriptions and details"" so you can write at length about this. Now I just expanded that field, but you can actually expand a whole record and see everything at a bird's-eye view and attachments and links once again.

[00:21:45.660] - Lanie
Let's look at the other views that we can see this under. So we have the ""Calendar View"". Again, we can see we have that filter on and we can shift our due dates around just by moving our tasks around here, or you could move them around up here as well. We also have a ""Gallery View"" that we can take advantage of for our tasks if you're kind of a post-it-note kind of person. And I want to point something out about these views. Now, if I wanted to create multiple calendar views, let's say I'm Jane Doe and I wanted to create a calendar view just for the tasks that are attributed to me, I could go ahead and create a calendar this way.

[00:22:16.770] - Lanie
So everybody on your team can go ahead and create a personalized calendar. So ""Jane's Calendar"" and you would filter it: add filter, contact, contains ""Jane Doe"". Voila, all of the ""Jane Doe"" attributed tasks are being filtered here, so I only have to see the things that I'm supposed to be doing if I'm Jane Doe. So as you can guess, month-two is going to be very similar to month-one, and month-three is going to be more of the same deal. You're going to go ahead and you're going to bring in what you're working towards. This color coding really helped with the month-three, this is what we're going to be working towards, and you're going to write in all the tasks to complete. These are going to show up in the ""Contacts"" as well as the ""To Achieve in 90 days"". So when I said earlier, we'll come back to that and see how interesting that looks. Yeah, you can see all of the tasks here as well. In case it was of interest to you, if you do have recurring tasks that aren't necessarily related to a goal, but you still have to keep the lights on, create and delegate recurring tasks in this table.

[00:23:09.860] - Lanie
So here you are, your quarterly plan in a way where your big-picture goals broken down into more or less modules that then get [singing 00:23:19] individual tasks associated to them. Now, when I say you're always going to have to keep your eye on the prize, you'll always be accountable to doing work that matters to your goals. What I mean by that is that if you are going to add a task here, ""irrelevant task"" goes here, and this doesn't actually relate to anything, you're going to have a big old gap here saying this doesn't have anything to do with what you're trying to accomplish. You're working on stuff, assigning tasks that don't even matter to your big-picture goals. That will always be evident here. In the next video, we're going to deal with something similar where you're always going to have to associate the content that you're creating to your big-picture message and to an offer that is designed to get you either paid or collect that email address.

[00:24:00.520] - Liz
Thank you so much for this session. I need to go and create probably a new workspace in Airtable to implement all the things I just learned. Thank you again. Any final thoughts for attendees before we talk about your free offer that you've got for everybody?

[00:24:16.250] - Lanie
So that first base that you saw that to build your content out, that is available with this talk, so it's totally free. You can find that second one, the bonus one that I showed you with the quarterly planning, that's available in the ""All Access Pass"". I'm giving the ""Airtable Like A  Boss Light"", it's the light version of my course, so you'll be able to do more cool beans things with Airtable in that course that's in the ""All Access Pass."" So grab it.

[00:24:43.840] - Liz
Yeah so if you are an ""All Access Pass"" holder already, get that. You'll get free access to that course. For those you who want to check out a little bit more before you go that route, definitely go grab the freebie. The link for that is below. Again, Lanie thank you so much for just sharing all your knowledge and helping everyone get a grip on the editorial calendar and the aspect of making sure your content converts.

[00:25:10.480] - Lanie
Thank you for having me. And happy summiting, everyone.

[00:25:13.670] - Liz
Yes, yes let us know in the Facebook group what you thought of the session and which one is your favorite so far, for sure.

**Transcript:**
[00:00:00.260] - Liz Stapleton
Hey, guys. It's Liz Stapleton. I can't believe that this is the last session of the Blogger Breakthrough Summit, February 2020. It has been incredible to see everything the speakers have presented, to see you guys and your feedback. I'm sure you guys took a ton of note because it was a lot of sessions, and you're probably feeling a little bit overwhelmed right now, maybe, with all the things on your blogging to-do list. In this session, I'm We're really going to talk about how you can take action on everything you learned because you learned a lot, a lot of that. This is just some of the stuff you guys posted in comments and emails and in the Facebook group. And it was just you love the session, you took so many notes, and just now I'm sure you have a lot to do. There was actually a lot more than this. I just tried to get some of it in here. So how do you actually implement it all? So first of all, I want you to realize that any progress is progress. And I'll show you what I mean, because you do not have to get everything done that you learned in the next week.

[00:01:13.820] - Liz Stapleton
I know you want to, but sleep's important, family's important. If you have a dog like me, she's going to whine at you if you're working all the time. But any progress is progress. And I'm going to show you. I'm going to show you some embarrassing pictures of my website. So I want to show you what my website first looked like. So if you're new, really, I guarantee you're probably miles ahead of where I was. This was the very first version of my website in August 2014. It was called Friday Night's Shenanigans. You can't even... It's terrible colors. It's awful, right? A year later, it's actually not that much better. I had between then, between 2014 and this is August 2015, I had actually taken and signed up for my very first blogging course. I think I signed up in May. And so that's why I have an email list stuff going. But that's about all I had going for it. I managed to finally figure out how to make a drop-down menu. Took me six months to figure out how to make a drop-down menu, but good times. And then this was in summer or fall of 2016.

[00:02:14.360] - Liz Stapleton
Again, still not that much better. I have a better background, still can't totally read the writing. I would like to go ahead and take credit that I took that picture that's the background because I was trying to make stock photos or something and doing a terrible job. It's like a white sheet, Anyway, this is like two years in the blogging, guys, and my site looks like this. So I promise you, any progress is progress. And then I changed names and There we ran in. This was the first version of the rebrand in 2017. And then finally in 2018, started to see my site take shape into what it is now. It's a little bit closer. And then I really haven't touched it in a year, but this is it looks like today. So this is when I started. This is when I started, this is today. So any progress is progress. And don't be afraid to put things out there. They're not going to be perfect. You're probably going to cringe when you go back and look at them. I definitely cringe when I see this on so many levels. I don't know why. I had DIY.

[00:03:19.700] - Liz Stapleton
I'm not a craft blogger. I didn't know what I was doing. So just any progress is progress. And then I want you to recognize the layout of the So I was very intentional on how I crafted the schedule of the summit. So the first day was foundational stuff. We had tech sessions, we had design and branding sessions. Day two, we got into more of the... So day one was foundational, and day two was a bit more of the structure. We had content creation sessions. We had legal sessions to make sure you're protecting your business. We had a bunch of other... So I was very... First day is foundational, second day was structural. Third day, we were talking about marketing and how to get your stuff out there with social media and Pinterest and YouTube. I believe that was the right day. And just really getting stuff out there. And then day four was about monetization, where you learn how to navigate your analytics and how to do sales pages and create courses and do sponsored content. So it was really focused on monetization. And then today has really been focused on automating, systemizing, scaling, and time management, because it can be a lot.

[00:04:38.240] - Liz Stapleton
So recognize the layout of the summit and how it was presented. And then think, is your foundation strong? You probably learned a lot in those sessions the first day. Go ahead and try to implement some of those things. Make sure you've learned the tech. And then just anything that you're like, yeah, I need to do. That's probably stuff that you only have to once. So maybe you just need to go fill in that foundation a little bit. Maybe make that your first thing you do. And then just get it done, get it off the list. And then I want you to look at the structure of your blogging business. So Tuesday, it wasn't just content, it wasn't just legal stuff. We also had some accountants talking the money side of blogging and having to be a CEO and look at things like that. Look at the structure of your blogging business. Is that sound? Do you need to register with your state? Do you want to form a business entity? Do you have a separate banking account for your blogging stuff? Do you have a privacy policy on your site? These are all things that you want to just...

[00:05:41.080] - Liz Stapleton
Again, they're typically things that it's setting it up right, that you may have skipped over. If you've been blogging for a little while, I definitely skipped over some of these at the beginning. So you want to just go in, set your strong foundation from those sessions, go and look at the structure, and do what you need to do to make sure you're protecting yourself and you're setting up your business for success and for growth. And then day three, once you've got the foundation stuff and the structure stuff set, then you want to come up with your marketing strategy. Don't try to do it all at once. Really focus on Pinterest if you're going to focus on Pinterest, or really focus on YouTube if you're really going to focus on YouTube. Do one at a time. Don't try to do all the things. Maybe YouTube is not your thing, or Pinterest isn't your thing, or Instagram isn't your or it's just not where your audience is. Maybe your audience isn't on Pinterest, maybe they're on Instagram. It just depends. You need to know your audience. And that was a theme running through, I think, many of the sessions throughout the summit is knowing your audience.

[00:06:44.690] - Liz Stapleton
And knowing your audience is going to help you figure out what marketing strategy is going to best for you. Because you not only want to go where your audience is going to be, but you also want to go where you enjoy. If you hate Instagram, can you find your audience somewhere else? Or maybe You don't want to do Instagram. I mean, everyone's a little bit different. Everyone has different strengths. So day three was marketing stuff. Come up with a marketing strategy. Look at the notes from day three and make a list of ideas. We're not going to... You don't have to implement them all. We're going to get to that list of ideas in a bit. But look at your day one notes, make a list of what needs to be done. And I would probably prioritize those. We'll get to that in a minute. Day two, what's I'm on the list? Just make a giant list. I know it's going to be a lot. I have been blogging for obviously years and I learned a lot from the summit. I have a long list that I'm going to share with you guys, just as an example.

[00:07:41.050] - Liz Stapleton
So we're going to talk about how to deal with that. But look at the marketing strategy you want to focus on and really write it down and get clear, because I know when you end up with so many ideas from summits or from conferences, it can be hard to implement if you're not really clear on them and you like And ideas can go floating, right? And you need to capture ideas, right? Jeff Goin talked about that, is you need to capture your ideas. If you've ever read Big Magic, it's a similar thing. But yeah, so capture the idea is in a big list. We're going to deal with that list in a minute, but make sure you do that. Focus on one monetization strategy at time. So maybe you want to go through your entire site and optimize it for affiliate marketing. Fine. Do that, but make Take out your focus and realize it's going to take more than a day. It takes time. Give yourself time. Give yourself a month, two months, three months, depending on how much content is on there. And say, Okay, well, each day I'm going to do two posts.

[00:08:43.260] - Liz Stapleton
I'm going to go through and make sure they're optimized. I use Lasso, which makes it easy for me to tell how well monetized a page or post is. But there's other things you could do. You could go post by post. It's up to you. And then systemize one thing at a time as well. Because, and I'm guilty of this too, when you try to systemize all the things, it can get complicated really fast. But if you just do one thing at a time, it's easier to replicate that system for other stuff. And I find the simpler things are, the better they work, personally. So I just want to keep that in mind. And then when you can, upgrade to tools that allow you to automate. When you can afford it. And there are some free tools. So I automate with free tools. I use a lot of Google stuff that I can just automate. Zapier is a great automation tool that has a wonderful free plan. I was on it for years. I literally just had to upgrade to it this year. And I've been blogging since 2014. So, wow, almost six years. Anyway, so like Zapier is a free tool.

[00:09:52.130] - Liz Stapleton
So there's free tools out there that can grow with you. Clickup, you've heard talked about a lot in the summit. It's free, Airtable is free. You So there's lots of free tools you can use that can grow with you. But you do, like Jen Williams said, you want to pick something that can grow with you because it's a pain to move stuff over. I've been through that more than once through email marketing services and course platforms. And just, yeah, it's annoying. I think I finally found my Goldilocks moment with tools in 2020. So what I want you to do is I want you to say, I'm just three things to get done this next week. And I want you to comment Comment below with what you're going to do in the next week. I want you to commit to that. Just three things. And maybe there are three things from the foundational stuff. Maybe it's three things from the structural. Maybe it's three things from three different days. It's really up to you and I think you need to pay attention to what is going to make the biggest difference in your blogging business. Also what excites you most.

[00:10:51.390] - Liz Stapleton
Because if there's three things you dread, you're not going to get them done. At least one or two of them has to be exciting where you can't wait to see what the change what it's going to do for your business. One should probably be an easy check off. But yeah, so I want you to review your notes, like I said, and then make a list of everything. And then I want you to implement the strategy that Jennifer Dawn covered. If you missed her session, basically what she said, and it was light bulbs for me. I was like, I can't believe I've never done this, is when you look at that list, you need to designate the priority of those. So are they A tasks? Are they B-level tasks? Are they C-level tasks? I think she said D and E, but I'm going to focus on A, B, and C. And then make sure that each day you're getting at least one A-level task done. So prioritize them like that. And if you feel like you're not making progress, you need to look, Okay, well, have I just been working on C-level tasks? Because that makes a big difference.

[00:11:48.390] - Liz Stapleton
So think about that. And I'm just going to give you an example because I'm sure you have long lists. This is part of my list, and some of this existed before the summit. But I was like, I really need to fix my Google Analytics. My Google Analytics has, I am embarrassed to say this, but it's been messed up for a year, and I don't know why. I've tried to go in and figure it out a couple of times. I need to just sit down and do it and get it fixed. I need to set up. I use Lasso. I pay for Lasso. I use it on one site, I can use it on my other. I just haven't done it. I really want to read the brand storytelling book that Lanie Lamere mentioned because it's not the first time that book has been mentioned to me. I feel like the more I hear it, the more I'm like, Yeah, I need to go read I want to implement her Airtable base because it's very different than how I've thought about a content strategy before. I need to complete my move to Elementor. If you guys saw that session or some of the other sessions, I have been moving away from a different page builder that I have been using.

[00:12:45.390] - Liz Stapleton
And I had been struggling with Elementor until I took Pete's lesson, and then it just really helped me a lot. Like his one session, and I was off to the races with Elementor. So I need to finish moving everything over. I need my home page on my Less Debt, More Wine site, which is my personal wine site, which I showed the example of. If you're on mobile, there's no way to easily access the blog, which is bad. And I need to fix that. So I want to look at my brainstormed list of ideas, and then I want to marry them with my Google Search Console data, because I have Google Search Console. I've had it set up for a long time, but I've never really dug in. And there were some great sessions in the summit when I When I was recording with speakers, I was like, I need to do this. I'd love to start doing video. I'm not going to go through my entire list, okay? But the point is everyone's got a list, okay? But I'm going to ABC these, making it so people can actually get to my blog. That's probably an A-level task.

[00:13:48.530] - Liz Stapleton
It won't take long, but it's something that needs to be done. Completely moving everything to Elementor, that's going to take me time. That's something I'm going to be in the next quarter. By the end of the next quarter, I want to be moved over to Elementor. Part of the reason is because I don't want to renew the other page builder I've been using. So you can look at things like that to create the dates. And then don't go to alone. Blogging, you're in front of your computer the whole time. And it can be lonely. And so I really found the most progress with my blog and got the furthest when I had others to talk to and made friends that were other bloggers. So go join the Facebook group if you're not in there already. The Facebook group is staying open after the summit is over. So that is a great group of people that you can relate to and talk to and help you stay accountable and on track. And if you're looking for something more than just a Facebook group, let me know because I am playing with some ideas on that front.

[00:14:49.280] - Liz Stapleton
But I'd love to hear what you'd be interested in. What would help you to stay on track with all the ideas from the summit? What accountability do you feel you need? Let me know. Tell me in the comments, tell me in the Facebook group, because I would love to try to provide that for you because I know this is a lot and it can be a lot. But don't go alone with blogging. Make a friend It can be you find a couple of people, maybe from the Facebook group, and you create a mastermind where you meet once a month. Masterminds have pushed me to new heights. They truly have. I've been a few. I've left some. It happens. But they can be a great way to just hold you accountable, because if you have other people that know you're working on something, and by the next call, you haven't done anything on it, they're going to call you out. And it's helpful, but it's in a supportive way, because I don't know about you guys, but I've been blogging for six years. My family still doesn't understand what I do. My parents and my sister, they're asking me about the summit or something, and I was like, well, it's not really...

[00:15:56.410] - Liz Stapleton
And they're like, yeah, we still know what you do. And I've been self-employed for over three years. So if it weren't for my blogging friends, then I know I never would have gotten self-employed. I'd never be doing this summit for you guys, especially because many of my blogging friends are speakers. And then I'm so excited to meet the speakers I didn't know and get to get to talking with them. It's a lot of fun. Just reach out. You'd be surprised at how generous the blogging community can be and how many people are willing to be like, Yeah, I need a buddy, too. So don't go it alone. Don't be afraid to switch things up. If one group isn't working for you, no drama. Just feel like, guys, I'm going to move on and go find another group to create or something. That's fine, too. So don't go to alone. And give yourself grace. Because I know blogging can just take over your life. But of course, life is about more than just blogging about it. Give yourself grace to do one thing at a time. If all you do each day is get one thing off that list or even one subtask off that list, because some of those, at least from my list, it actually has several steps to it for me to actually get that done.

[00:17:15.140] - Liz Stapleton
I just get one step done. Because you're looking at this list and it's on top of what you're already doing with your blog, creating content regularly, whatever it is you're already doing, chances are this list is piling on. And hopefully some of the systems and automations, and Kayla had a great session on how to onboard a VA, hopefully all that will help you to take some off the plate or lower the amount of time it takes to do things. Some of the perks should help you Look at that. And yes, there's paid products and the perks, but there's also my magic pin generator that I created. It's totally free for my subscribers. I should say it's totally free for my subscribers. But you just subscribe and then you're able to put in 10 titles into a form. In a few minutes, it's going to send you an email with 50 pins. So five pens for each post or each title that you do. And you can swap stuff out. The graphics that are in there, you can use because I took them, so I own them. I'm like, Yeah, go ahead and use these on the pins if they work for you.

[00:18:16.770] - Liz Stapleton
So give yourself grace. Do one thing at a time. And that's one of the hardest lessons I had to learn in my almost six years of blogging, is giving myself a break because it is 100 % possible to constantly be working on your blog. I've done it. And life's not that fun, we need to. It's unhealthy for me in a lot of ways, at least. So give yourself grace, give Give yourself a break. Don't beat yourself up. I know none of us want a post to go out late, but if it's just a one-off, your audience will understand. No one's perfect. So I just like to say that. Give yourself grace. And then finally, I just want you... In case anyone hasn't told you today, you are capable. Because if I can do it, really anyone can. Do you recall what my site first looked like? And I'm still here. So if you're willing to dig in your heels and keep going at it, I found in my experience and just talking to other bloggers and stuff, typically, if you can make it a year blogging, you're going to make it. So you are capable. If I can do as anyone can, I mean, My parents are vastly different technologically, and I probably take after more leaning towards my mom who can walk towards a computer and it'll crash.

[00:19:39.180] - Liz Stapleton
I am not kidding. And so it's a long running joke. She was like, here, Let me show you. And she's managed to do it on multiple occasions. I don't know why computers don't like her. So I can figure it out. You totally can. I've never been a super techy person, but I am stubborn and I do like to learn and I don't stop learning. So I think if you follow those as well, you're going to make... You're going to hit your goals. And hopefully you've taken a lot away from this summit. And if not, if there was a session you were absolutely dying to see, and you miss it, you can always grab the All Access Pass. That is available to you. And it will give you lifetime access to the session. So you can go back and watch ones you missed or rewatch ones, because I definitely... In preparing for the summit, I watched many of the sessions more than once to get everything ready, which we still had a couple of tech issues, and I do apologize for that. I tried to get those fixed as quickly as possible, but I was pretty proud that we had as few tech issues as we did because I had spent so much time going through them.

[00:20:46.840] - Liz Stapleton
And I feel like every time I went through them, I took away something new. So consider that if you need the extra time, consider getting the all access pass, but no pressure. Hopefully you got a ton out of this. Go join the Facebook group. It is free to join. There's a great group in there. Everyone's super nice. I like hanging out with you guys in there and I'm not going away. So the Facebook group isn't going to suddenly shut down or go dark when the summit ends. If you want to keep things rolling, go join the group. Let me know if there's something that I can do to help you, please tell me that, too. You would shoot me an email, hello@elizabethstapleton.Com. Hello@elizabethstapleton.come I can talk, I swear I can say my name. Or tag me on social media or DM or something. I'm not as good at checking the DMs, actually. So email is probably best for tagging me if I'm being completely honest. But yeah, so you are capable. Give yourself grace. Don't go it alone. And look at that list. Go through all your notes, make a list. A, B, C.

[00:21:56.540] - Liz Stapleton
That. Prioritize those tasks. And then set realistic like, my goal this quarter is to get this one task done. Maybe that's it. Or my goal this month, don't be like, I'm going to try to get all this done in the next two weeks because you will burn yourself out. And blogging is a lot of fun, but burning out is not. So don't do that. And guys, I cannot thank you enough for coming to the Blogger Breakthrough Summit. It has been a labor of love for me as I've worked on it, especially the first time. And I put in hundreds of hours of work. And so I'm so glad you guys showed up and found value in it. And hopefully the next one will be even better. So thank you again for being part of the summit. I hope you found this helpful. If there's anything I can do that could be helpful or make this better, please, please tell me. I'll catch you guys at the next summit.

**Transcript:**
[00:00:00.000] - Liz Stapleton, Host
All right, guys. I'm really excited for this next session of the Blogger Breakthrough Summit. I'm super excited to have Lynn Neville here, a Business Growth Strategist, here to share her expertise on enhancing your blogging strategy through smart content creation and dynamic collaborations because it's always better to work smarter, not harder. Lynn, welcome. I'm super excited that you're here.

[00:00:33.970] - Lynn Neville
Thanks for having me. I'm super excited to be here.

[00:00:37.130] - Liz
Yeah. So, what are we going to be focusing on? Because I know we've titled this, Leveraging Done-For-You Content and Buzzworthy Collaborations. That can encompass a lot. So what's our focus today?

[00:00:50.040] - Lynn
Yeah. So, today I'm going to be sharing how utilizing done-for-you content can significantly cut down on the time that you spend writing and planning, and how thoughtful collaborations can amplify the content that you've created, and the impact that it makes. 

[00:01:05.630] - Liz
Okay. Let's take a step back and make sure everyone understands what we're saying when you say done-for-you content.

[00:01:12.640] - Lynn
So, done-for-you content or it's also known as PLR, which stands for Private Label Rights, is content that's essentially pre-created material that bloggers can purchase and then legally customize and publish as their own. And so that means that you can take that content, you can edit it, you can transform it, and you can publish it as if you wrote it yourself. So, it's like a cheat, but it's actually legal. So, think about it as having a team of writers assisting you behind the scenes. So, for instance, common forms of done-for-you content for bloggers include blog posts, email sequences, social media posts, and even e-books, which you can tailor to fit your brand and your audience. And using done-for-you content can be really transformative in terms of efficiency. For instance, a survey by the... I'm going to throw some stats at you. The survey by the Content Marketing Institute revealed that content creation time was cut by over 30% when using curated or licensed content. And for bloggers, that's a huge chunk. So, for busy bloggers, this means maintaining an active and consistent posting schedule really becomes so much less daunting.

[00:02:21.770] - Lynn
And with done-for-you content, you're not just starting from a blank page. I've stared at so many blank pages. I'm like, 'What am I supposed to write about?' So, with done-for-you content, you're given a foundation that you can quickly personalize with your unique insights and branding, and that really accelerates the content creation process. So, if you want to hear about a client of mine?

[00:02:44.090] - Liz
Um, yeah. Just one second, though. I want to take a step back because you specifically said curated and licensed because quality matters. So, how do you curate good, done-for-you content sources, I guess?

[00:02:58.420] - Lynn
Yeah, there's a lot of crap out there. So, if you were just to Google PLR or done-for-you content, a lot of crap shows up. What I recommend, and something I didn't mention when you were introducing me was that I was a wellness and fitness blogger. I'm an avid CrossFitter. I did all the group fitness training. And so as a former blogger, I know what it's like to spend all that time trying to create your own content. And you know your style. You have your own style. You have your own way of communicating with your audience. So, when you're curating done-for-you content, you want to make sure that that content fits your audience. It's exactly what they're going to be looking for. So, if I'm writing about CrossFit and I find done-for-you content that talks about something not involving CrossFit at all, then you're not doing your job curating the right kind of content. You want to make sure the subject matter is on point with your audience, that it is something that you can transform into your own personal voice and your own personal brand, and that is quality.

[00:03:58.870] - Lynn
So, there's a lot of done-for-you content out there, it's plagiarism, basically. It's been used so many times, and I'll talk a little bit more about how to steer away from that, but it's even used so many times that it's not you. No matter how much personalization you put in there, everyone else has used it. Those are just a few things.

[00:04:20.120] - Liz
Okay, which then brings me to the next point of keeping content authentic. So, taking that PLR done-for-you content and making it your own. So, how do you do that and maintain that authenticity?

[00:04:35.980] - Lynn
Yeah, so absolutely. Personalization is where the magic really happens. It's all about transforming that base content, the one that you purchase into something that feels uniquely yours. So, by infusing your own stories, your expertise, and your voice, you create a connection with your audience that goes way beyond just sharing information. So, personalized content can improve reader engagement and potentially increase conversion rate, which is what we all want for any calls to action that you have within your blog. So, even thinking about just the calls to action themselves. When you buy curated content that has generalized calls to action, you can personalize it by putting in your specific calls to action - whether it's to book a call with you, whether it's to sign up for a coaching session, or it could be even follow this link to see related articles on your blog. So, simple calls to action can personalize your content. And then here's a little nugget of wisdom. Consistency doesn't just keep your readers engaged. It's also gold for your SEO efforts, right? And bloggers are all about SEO. So, search engines love regularly updated content in your audience would too.

[00:05:41.260] - Lynn
They'll come to rely on your blog as a consistent source of valuable insights, which keeps them coming back for more. And when you have that done-for-your content, it makes it so much easier to stay consistent with your content creation. So, ways to personalize your done-for-your content so that it resonates with your brand. Here's a couple of tips. So first, inject your style. Don't just copy and paste done-for-you content. You want to adapt the tone to match the way that you communicate with your audience. And so, if you're humorous, add a joke or two. If you're inspirational, then you want to weave in typical motivational insights that you provide. And then two, share personal anecdotes. So again, really personalize that content that you've been given as a base. So, relate the content to your own experiences. This not only adds authenticity but also differentiates your post from anyone else that's using the same done-for-you content.

[00:06:36.000] - Liz
No, I like that. All right. So, I love that spin on how to make it authentic and your own. Before we dive into collaborations, what are some things people should be thinking about or that you want to ask that they do?

[00:06:51.760] - Lynn
Yeah. So, one question I ask all the time is, and specifically for those of you watching this, have you used done-for-you content in a particularly creative or innovative way to grow your business? And I have a couple of success stories to share as well. But I would love to hear. I'm going to be coming back to this chat throughout the duration of the Summit. So, if anyone drops any thoughts in here, I'd love to hear them. So, one of my favorite success stories involves a food blogger named Maria. She specialized in vegan recipes, but she was struggling to keep up with the demand for new content. Big struggle that all of us bloggers have. So, she purchased a bundle of done-for-you content, focusing on vegan meal plans but wanted to do something really unique with it. And I love that. So, instead of just posting the meal plans as they were, what she did was she created a challenge around them. So, she did a 30-day vegan voyager program where she used the meal plans as a base for a community experience. And participants would sign up to receive the daily emails with the meal plan for the day.

[00:07:52.720] - Lynn
But she personalized it with her specific tips and tricks for making the meals, and a link to a private Facebook group where everyone could share their creations. So, you've got that built-in community engagement right there. And so, what she also did was she added her own cultural flair for each of the meal plans. So, vegan recipes, that was the done-for-you content. She infused the recipes with her Hispanic heritage. I love that, what she did there. So, it not only personalized the content, but it also catered to an audience that was really eager for culturally diverse vegan options. So, the result, her email list grew by 50% in just one month in the 30-day challenge. And her website traffic doubled because participants were checking in daily for the tips. And most importantly, the sense of community and engagement skyrocketed. So, her blog turned into a vibrant hub for vegan enthusiasts and those curious about the lifestyle. And a lot of the participants, they actually remained active community members even after the challenge. So, the things that you could do with done-for-you content when you really get creative.

[00:08:56.930] - Liz
Yes. No, I love that. Okay, so that's done-for-you content. We're also going to talk about collaborations, which I clearly love. I do a summit every single year, and I always aim to have at least 50 speakers, which makes me crazy. But can you elaborate on different types of collaborations? You don't have to do a 50 person summit, I swear. Like I said, I'm just crazy. So, collaborations that can save time, create buzz, and maybe give us some examples.

[00:09:28.480] - Lynn
Yeah. I actually run bundles, which are similar to the Summit. My last one was 230 contributors. I'm like, we're nuts. You and I are both nuts. Okay. So, collaborations come in many forms, as you know. But some of the most effective for bloggers in particular are, and I'm just going to name a couple, guest posting and co-hosting webinars or live events. For example, guest posting on a popular blog in your niche can give you access to an established audience, which can be a huge time saver in terms of audience growth, because you're borrowing that person's already existing audience and getting in front of an already warm audience. Co-hosting a webinar allows you to share the workload and the spotlight, which offers valuable content while increasing your visibility. So, when you're running a co-hosting webinar with someone, they may have knowledge that you don't have in particular. So, the two of you bring your joint knowledge in front of an audience that is warmed up and ready to hear it, it would be adding value that you wouldn't have to provide to them. So, let me give you a real-life example to illustrate the power of smart collaboration.

[00:10:34.570] - Lynn
So, remember, Maria, the food blogger who specialized in the vegan recipes? Well, we arranged for her to guest blog on a well-known wellness site, and she also co-hosted a virtual cooking workshop with them. So, the guest post alone brought her a blog boost of 30% in traffic. And the workshop, it was an absolute hit. So, she reached hundreds of live viewers and even more in the replays, leading to a huge increase in her blog subscribers and course signups. So, it wasn't just the subscribers coming in, but it was also the sales that she was making through the course that she was offering. So, this wasn't just about tapping into someone else's audience. It was about finding a community that resonated with her message. And the collaboration was a win-win that turned into a quarterly event, steadily growing her brand visibility and establishing her as the go-to-expert in Hispanic-style vegan and cooking.

[00:11:29.210] - Liz
Yeah. So when you're talking about collaborations, just to recap what you said right? There's the benefit of you're getting in front of someone's audience, you're hopefully drawing them to your site, getting new subscribers, and new sales, but the non-tangibles, building your authority. More people are seeing you. A tangible techy back thing is backlinks always help SEO. Have we missed anything about the benefits of collaborating?

[00:11:54.320] - Lynn
Yeah. So, collaborations aren't just about getting your name out there. And I was going to mention the whole backlinks thing. So, for anyone who doesn't know, I'm sure everybody here knows watching this, the backlinks are links from other websites coming back to your blog. And search engines love backlinks. So, when you're collaborating, especially doing a guest blog post with someone else, then your content is going on their website. And you usually have a section in there that talks about your little bio and where they can find your link to your website. So, that's creating a backlink automatically back to your website, to your blog. The collaborations are also like a vote of confidence in your content, which can help boost your SEO. Second, there's the credibility boost, which you mentioned. So, when you're seen with well-respected peers, just like with a summit, because I'm being seen with other well-respected peers, it gives me a little bit of visibility and a credibility boost. So, same thing when you're doing a guest blog post or you're doing a joint webinar with somebody else. That credibility rubs off on you.

[00:12:58.020] - Lynn
So, it's like getting an instant stamp of approval that says, 'Hey, this blogger really knows their stuff.' And then don't forget about the content reach. So, when you collaborate with another blogger, you're not just reaching your audience, but also your collaborator's - when I was mentioning you're borrowing their audience. So, what you're doing is that you're effectively doubling your visibility. So, imagine one of your posts gets shared across their social networks or their newsletters. And we're talking here about really an exponential exposure here. But it's not just about what you get. You have to think about collaboration. It's also about what you give. So, you bring your unique insight to new audiences who may become loyal fans of your work. And it's really a beautiful synergy where everyone involved, you, your collaborator, and both of your audiences benefit. So, collaborations to me are always a multiplier of marketing efforts.

[00:13:48.990] - Liz
Yes, I love collaborating. I feel like that's actually been the primary driver of my business growth since I started with collaborations. My first guest post, I didn't even know what a guest post was, I didn't realize that that's what I was doing, but it worked. I was like, 'Oh, my gosh, I got 42 people to my site.' I was like a baby blogger. And so, yeah. No, it's each. And then that guest post ended up... She wrote a book and she included that guest post in her book. So, you never know where those collaboration things will take you. And I always think it's really cool that my first guest post ended up in a book.

[00:14:21.270] - Lynn
That's awesome.

[00:14:23.770] - Liz
Okay. Collaborations can be amazing, and they're so awesome. But I've also seen some really bad attempts at collaborations. What do you think are the biggest or most common mistakes people make when it comes to trying to collaborate or being part of a collaboration?

[00:14:42.910] - Lynn
Yeah. So, many jump in without a strategy and they're just seeking any collaboration instead of finding the right one. So, the best collaborations align with your values and offer your readers real benefits. It's not just about growing your reach, it's about growing your community. So, a couple of things that you want to make sure you have in place before seeking out other collaborations is making sure you have the same values, and that you are sharing the same information. I wouldn't want to collaborate with someone who I don't like their style, I don't like how they communicate with their audience. You want to make sure that you're vibing together, you have similar values. And then the other thing is you want to make sure you have a shared target audience. So, if my audience was 50 and older and your audience is 20 to 30 years old, it's not really a shared audience. They may not be interested in the same kind of topic. Those are a couple of things that many bloggers out there make mistakes for in terms of collaborations.

[00:15:42.240] - Liz
Yes. And trying to spam them, I'd say, is like another one. I don't know if you see that a lot. I feel like I see a lot of spammy... Again, it's people just being - anything and everything. So yeah.

[00:15:57.380] - Lynn
Yes.

[00:15:58.980] - Liz
So, because of the spam and all the things, it can be really challenging to find quality collaborations, and the right people to partner with. What's your strategy for identifying potential collaborators who align with you and your vibe? Any best practices you have or tips for that?

[00:16:20.650] - Lynn
Yeah. So, identifying the right collaborators starts with clarity on your own brand values and understanding your audience deeply. So, you really need to know your audience. You're not just throwing information out there hoping something sticks. You want to look for potential partners who share a similar audience demographic, like I said, and who have values that resonate with your brand, again, like I said. And before reaching out, engage with their content. This is a relationship that you're trying to form, not just one-off. If you think about just the guest blog post thing, this is my one time I'm going to guest blog post. No, you're building a relationship with them. There might be other kinds of collaborations that you can do with them down the road. So, you want to make sure you're building a relationship. So, before reaching out to someone to ask them for collaboration, you want to engage with their content. You want to understand their message. You want to make sure that there's a synergy between what you both can offer. So, think about if you found someone on Instagram, you have a similar target audience, you have the same values, and you want to collaborate with them, but you haven't followed, you haven't read their post, you don't know anything about them, and then you blindly spam them with a request.

[00:17:26.040] - Lynn
'I'd love to collaborate with you. This is what I want. This is what I want.' That's not building a relationship. You're asking for me, me, me. They're not going to say yes. They're not even going to respond to your request. So, make sure that you're trying to build that relationship. And for best practices, clear communication from the start is crucial. You want to set expectations. You want to define rules. You want to agree on outcomes. So, when I have someone do it, I actually have a form they have to fill out if they want to do a guest blog post for me. And so it's me being able to vet them and make sure that they can write in a way that my audience would like to hear, and also that the topic that they want to propose matches with what my audience is looking for. So, you always want to enter collaborations with a mindset of mutual benefit, meaning what value can you bring to them and vice versa. So, when we were talking about this before we hit record - about the podcast being on a podcast - when you pitch someone to be on a podcast, say you just wrote this amazing blog post, and you want to get it out into someone else's podcast. You pitch them and you say, 'I really think I should be on your podcast.' That kind of thing.

[00:18:35.440] - Lynn
And you're not providing any value to them. You're only in that in email when you pitch to them, it's me, I, I, I, I, I, me, nothing about their audience, about the value that you bring to them, about how it can grow their podcast followers. That's not how it works. So, just a few things to think about.

[00:18:54.580] - Liz
Yeah. I have a feeling if my email to you to participate in the Summit had been like that, I would not have gotten a yes. Instead, I was like, 'Hey, this is how my Summit is a little different. We can figure out the right people to get you in front of. And this is how the process looks.' And hopefully, you felt very supported in the onboarding and you had everything you needed.

[00:19:14.842] - Lynn
I did.

[00:19:15.130] - Liz
It makes a big difference. And pay attention, guys, because like you said, you have a form for guest post bloggers. I have a guest post page where it's like, 'Hey, if you want to pitch me, here's the subject line you need to use, and here's what your email needs to include.' And if stuff doesn't have that, I don't respond. I don't bother. I'm like, 'If you can't even do the bare minimum of Googling my site and the phrase guest posts, no.' So, just pay attention, and dig a little deeper. I do that when I'm looking for people to pitch. I'm pitching speakers, guys, right? Yeah, I had speaker applications, but I also pitch speakers, and I have for every single year that this Summit has run. And when I go, I check out their website. I look at their About page. I look at their blog post. I see what they're an expert in. I'm not necessarily looking at, 'Oh, do they have a bunch of Instagram followers?' Because I don't particularly care. If they know their subject well, and I feel like the audience could benefit them, then I'm like, 'Yes, that's a good fit.' And we all grow together. The speakers we've had as part of the Summit, I've always love when I get someone returning because it means it was a great collaboration. So, yeah, my two cents on that front. I don't know if you want to add to any of that. 

[00:20:38.990] - Lynn
It's so funny because I was going to ask you that same exact question. What's your take on collaborations, especially in the blogging world? And there really is a finesse to building those relationships and to not even calling it pitching, but just seeking that kind of synergy with somebody else. And if it's all about me, me, me, and not about that other person, they're not going to be calling you back. If you're doing it right, if you're following the finesse and you built that, you know, the muscles for asking for collaborations, you're going to get people asking you to collaborate with them instead of you having to pitch. I mean, Liz, I'm sure you get requests all the time to be in other people's events. And so, that's what happens when you're doing this the right way, right?

[00:21:20.540] - Liz
 I don't actually get a lot. I would definitely be into get some more. But yeah. Yeah, no, but I do. Right? And it's because you get involved and it grows upon each other. It becomes an exponential thing, right? Because you're in this Summit with our other incredible speakers who maybe you hadn't collaborated with, and now you have something in common. And so when you reach out or they reach out to you, they'll be like, 'Hey, I saw you were also part of this.' And you can be like, 'Liz was awful or Liz was awesome. What did you think?' And say I'd love to work with you or whatever. It gives you common ground that maybe it would have made it a little more awkward to reach out or to establish that point of trust almost. So, okay. 

[00:22:10.100] - Lynn
Not to say don't do it. I mean, no matter what stage of your blogging journey you're in, don't be afraid. Don't be afraid to ask, because more often than not, that person that you want to reach out to is looking for collaborations too. So, don't be afraid to go and ask that question, invite that person to a collaboration.

[00:22:31.640] - Liz
Yeah, and I feel like especially with guest blogging because I see it all the time or I felt it when I was a new blogger. I was so nervous to pitch a guest post. But the reality is they don't always have time to write a post. You're giving them a piece of content. That is amazing. That's perfect for when they want to go on vacation. I see a lot of bloggers, women do it setting it up for maternity leave, is getting a bunch of guest bloggers so they can schedule out that content so they're not having to create all of it ahead of time. If it's a good collaboration it is truly mutually beneficial to both parties. So, it's a win-win. Think of it that way. I did want to ask, which we didn't really talk about, but when you're using collaboration, done-for-you content and stuff, that's a lot going on. Do you have any tips on keeping organized or systemizing to make sure you're being consistent with collaborating and content and whatnot?

[00:23:28.640] - Lynn
Yeah. So, just action steps that people should take.

[00:23:33.060] - Liz
Sure. Yeah.

[00:23:34.620] - Lynn
Yeah. So, four things I want to share with you guys. So, scouting for the right content provider, going back to what we were talking about, and making sure you're curating the right content. So, you want to begin by pinpointing a done-for-you content source that meshes well with your niche. So, when you go and Google, done-for-you blogging content for whatever your niche is make sure that you are pinpointing a content source that meshes well with your niche. And this isn't just about grabbing any kind of content. It's about finding material that speaks to your audience as if you wrote it yourself, as if you crafted it yourself. Whether it's a blog post, an email, or an ebook template, make sure that it's something that anyone looking at it would think it was written by you, from scratch. Second, make it your own. So, once you've got that content, it's time to really sprinkle in a little bit of your own magic. So, you want to adapt it to mirror your unique style and your voice. You can think of it as the prefab houses. So, taking that prefab house and adding your own cozy touches to turn it into a home. Wouldn't work well for me because I'm not an interior designer or you shouldn't look...Don't look. Don't look at it!

[00:24:42.210] - Lynn
 Third, identify ideal collaboration partners. So, create a list of potential partners who not only share your target audience, but also reflect your values and your brand style. So, then craft a proposal that's so tailored to them that they can't help but say yes. So, a proposal that just exudes - 'I love you. I've read your blog post on this, or I've listened to your podcast on this, and I absolutely love it. And I know my audience will love it too. They would love any information that you could provide.' So that, yes, they're going to say yes, they're going to want to say yes. And then fourth, track and tweak. This is really important. You can do all the stuff but not know what the results are. So, make sure that after you put your content and your collaborations out there, keep a close eye on how they perform. So, things you want to look at - metrics that you want to look at - traffic, engagement, and those conversion rates to gauge the success of using them for your content and collaborations, because it's all about learning and improving. So track those results.

[00:25:43.280] - Lynn
I know it's a pain in the butt sometimes, but you want to make sure you track those results, and then that way you can fine-tune your methods for even better outcomes the next time around.

[00:25:50.970] - Liz
Absolutely. Okay, I love that. And I know you've got some stuff to tell people about, to direct them to. Do you want to...Tell them what is linked below.

[00:26:02.150] - Lynn
Yep. So, in the link below you can grab my guide, the 30 Ways to Grow and Scale Your Business Through Collaborations. It's designed to give you a clear roadmap for leveraging collaborations to the fullest. So, I had a workshop recently and I focused on just two of the strategies that were mentioned in the guide. And the participants told me how they appreciated the clear and actionable steps. And one of the attendees, actually, implemented two of the strategies as well, and they saw a 20% increase in their collaboration within a month. So, that means people were reaching out to them to collaborate with them 20% more than they had been before. So, the guide has really quality advice. I'm all about simple, strategic strategies that can lead to real results and not just more noise. So, the guide can help you to start building a more engaged and expansive community around your blog, which is what we all want.

[00:26:55.160] - Liz
Yes. No, that's fantastic. And I know you have something in the Speaker Bonus Bundle as well. Do you want to tell us about that too?

[00:27:02.030] - Lynn
Yeah. So, in terms of done-for-you content, I'm providing the Positive Thinking Done-For-You Content Bundle Exclusive. So, if you've ever wished for content that just gets it, then you want to grab the Positive Thinking Done-For-You Content Bundle.

[00:00:00.000] - Liz Stapleton, Host
All right, guys. I'm super excited for this next session with Mariah from Mariah Magazine. First of all, Mariah, thank you so much for doing this. I really appreciate your time.

[00:00:07.880] - Mariah Magazine
Yeah, for sure. Thank you so much for asking. I really love talking about all of the stuff that we're going to get into. So I'm pretty soaked.

[00:00:16.270] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Yeah. We're going to be talking about SEO to search engine optimization, but particularly with how to really make your site SEO-friendly, on-site SEO, which I'm excited about because a lot of people don't realize there's difference. There's like an on-site, off-site. We'll get into that. But I'm excited to talk about that. Can you give us just a little bit about your background and what we're going to cover today?

[00:00:38.790] - Mariah Magazine
Yeah, for sure. Okay. So just like Liz said, I'm Mariah, an online growth strategist. I'm a founder over at mariahmagazine.Com, and I help entrepreneurs and creative business owners strategically grow their audiences through SEO and custom website growth strategies. So my whole thing is like, I believe that your website is just so much more than a few pages about your business. It's really where people can learn about you, engage with you, connect with you. It's your little corner of the web where you can share your passions and you can help your people and you can essentially make money while doing it. So my job is to connect you with your audience and to help your website be that driving foundation that really helps your business? Because if you think about it, that's like where all of your other online efforts point back to is your website. The reason why you're on social media is to get people over to the website. The reason why you have a YouTube channel is to get people over to your website. So SEO and these custom growth strategies that I use, the foundations of them don't just help you in search engines.

[00:01:56.480] - Mariah Magazine
It helps your website create this solid foundation for you to build upon. So that's why I'm super passionate about it. I actually got into it. I got into the industry doing website design, and then I saw that there was this huge gap in the market. It was like we would launch a client's website and we would all be super stoked about it. And then my client's like, All right, now what? And it's like I didn't have something for them. I didn't have like, Hey, go to this person. I didn't have a me to be able to appoint people to. You know what I mean? So it's like now I've transitioned and I'm focusing on SEO and growing and using your website strategically. So I actually partner with website designers. Those are my clients now and everything like that. So just how full circle everything comes is always really exciting.

[00:02:49.960] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Yeah. So let's go ahead and dive in because we're going to be discussing things you can do and some quick fixes you can even do for on-site SEO. But what is... Let's start off because I think some people may be confused. What is on-site SEO versus off-site SEO?

[00:03:08.540] - Mariah Magazine
I guess. Okay. Yeah. So on-site and off-site, it can also be referred to as on-page and off-page. So on-page SEO is more so the things that you have control over. It's the things on your website specifically. It's those SEO titles, the meta descriptions, your content itself, like your blog posts. It's all of those things. And then off-site actually has more to do with the promotion of your website and how authoritative Google sees you.

[00:03:45.420] - Liz Stapleton, Host
So it's like - Getting back links and things like that.

[00:03:48.410] - Mariah Magazine
That. Yeah. How your... What's the word that I'm... The authority, your reputation, your online reputation, how Google sees that. So people don't realize that that is a whole other piece to the puzzle. So so many people focus on, like when you mention SEO, everybody's like, keywords. Keywords content, keywords content, keywords content. Great. Wonderful. Writing blog post is probably one of the best ways to grow your SEO and your search rankings, and you do have control over that. The other huge powerhouse in terms of growing your SEO and getting better rankings is that offsite SEO. And noticed being in the online space that a lot of people aren't actually talking about that. They're not talking about the promotion of your blog post because that has something to do with it, too. So it's like you spend all of this time creating these blog posts and getting them perfect, making sure that your keyword is in your title and you're mentioning it here and all of these really great things, but nobody's seeing it. So it's like, how much is it really helping your SEO? And that's because you're missing that off page SEO portion, that promotion part.

[00:05:05.880] - Mariah Magazine
So I always tell my clients that you should be spending twice as much time promoting your content as you do creating it. And a lot of people are like, Wait, what? You know what I mean? There was always always.

[00:05:19.850] - Liz Stapleton, Host
That- like the 80-20 rule.

[00:05:21.820] - Mariah Magazine
Yeah, exactly. So it's like you really want to spend a lot more time promoting it. It's not good enough to go ahead and click publish on a a blog or create three blog posts a week and then promote none of them and then expect your SEO rankings to skyrocket. It's like, nobody's seeing this. There's so much content out there that you have to take it from a more strategic point of view. It's like, like, do I get people to see this content?

[00:05:47.620] - Liz Stapleton, Host
So.

[00:05:48.730] - Mariah Magazine
That's the biggest difference between on site and off site.

[00:05:53.580] - Liz Stapleton, Host
And Yeah. And we do have sessions on promoting with social media and and things. Definitely definitely check those for sure. That's super helpful. Yeah. So one thing, when I first started blogging, I was told, told, use Yoast. I was like, like, And I would try to make the lights green. And I mean, that's a whole other story. But then it wasn't until way way later I was like, oh, there's settings and all of my freebies are totally searchable in Google, which is not what I want. Can you share... I mean, Yoast and what similar plug-ins like that can do in terms of things you can adjust to make sure sure Google finding what you want it to find and how you can tell if it's it's.

[00:06:42.910] - Mariah Magazine
Yeah, for sure. Okay, so the biggest thing that I want to mention about Yoast is that at the end of the day, Yoast is a tool. So I know that so many people like the green light and everything like that, and they beat themselves up for not getting that green light. And And then like, Which keyword should I put in the focus keyword box? And it's like, that keyword that you put in is only how Yoast is reading your content and giving you an analysis.

[00:07:12.600] - Liz Stapleton, Host
It's not actually telling Google, Hey, this is a keyword for this post.

[00:07:15.660] - Mariah Magazine
Yeah. And that's a huge misconception. It's like, Well, what keyword do I put in here? And I was like, Well, Google is also going to see what the main idea of your content is. So I would rather you spend more time really focusing on on that content that Google thinks is helpful for your target audience. You know what I mean? Instead of sitting here... What was that?

[00:07:39.230] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Instead of trying to get green light for one keyword, but in reality, if it's a quality post, Google may rank it for multiple keywords.

[00:07:46.260] - Mariah Magazine
Yes, exactly. So that's a huge huge is that SEO really is a tool. And then especially if people are using Squarespace, they don't get to use Yoast. So people are like, like, a Squarespace? Is good. And it's like, Yoast Yoast is a Yoast is a really awesome tool that WordPress uses, but at the end of the day, it really is about your content and your website itself. But there are some settings in Yoast that you definitely want to pay attention to. Okay, is it cool if I screen share?

[00:08:18.420] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Yes, please.

[00:08:19.420] - Mariah Magazine
Okay, let me just just Can you see the back end of my WordPress?

[00:08:23.340] - Liz Stapleton, Host
I can.

[00:08:24.220] - Mariah Magazine
Okay, cool. Cool. So judge me on how many updates I haven't done. It's like the the Shoe maker's kid's have no shoes. I just reach updating your website all the time. And then I'm over here like, I'll get you my life.

[00:08:40.520] - Liz Stapleton, Host
I was like a Pinterest fan. I'm like, don't actually look at my Pinterest Pinterest accounts, look my clients. Clients.

[00:08:44.840] - Mariah Magazine
Yeah, Okay, so once you log in to WordPress and you download the Yoast plugin, you'll see that it shows up in your toolbar right here. So you can go ahead and click on that. That. I would download Yoast for a bunch of clients, and I realized that sometimes their features aren't even turned on. So it is important to come over here to Features and to make sure that you have your SEO analysis turned on, your readability analysis turned on, your site maps turned on. And then this is the admin bar menu is just like a preference type thing. So if you go ahead and turn that on and then then Save changes. You'll see that you'll be able to actually get Yoast straight up here in this toolbar, which is pretty cool. I think that it is a little distracting, so I turn it off. Okay, so then after you make sure that the right things are turned on, go go to Search Appearance, okay? And you're going to want to go ahead and fill out this information here. So either you're an organization or a business or a blog, or are you showing up as a person?

[00:10:14.420] - Mariah Magazine
So that's going to basically dictate the way that Google showcases your information in search results. And then you want to fill out this organization name and logo, and then settings for single posts. So do you want your post to show up in search results? You want to make sure that that's turned on.

[00:10:38.980] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Yeah.

[00:10:40.140] - Mariah Magazine
Another big thing is like the Yoast SEO Metabox. Want to make sure that that's showing up too, because that's what's actually going to give you more control over those customized SEO titles and those meta descriptions that are super important. And then if you scroll down, you have the same options for all the different kinds of content on your website. So let's say that you have products on your site, but let's say that maybe your products, you only want them to be available to people that are in your membership. Okay, so if that's the case, we don't want products to show up in search results. So then we would go ahead and toggle this off. So what that does is tell Google, Hey, these aren't for people in Google. Google. People search for things, I do not want my product showing up.

[00:11:32.650] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Yeah. And I remember I used to have Thrive leads or something, which I love. I've moved away for a variety of reasons.

[00:11:43.460] - Mariah Magazine
But.

[00:11:44.110] - Liz Stapleton, Host
When you search my site, a popup box would show up in the search, and it was because I hadn't toggled it off in Yoast. So even things like that where you're like, Go in and check, especially if you're in the midst of changing, plugins

[00:11:57.760] - Liz Stapleton, Host
 or tools that you you use, might show up and you may not want them actually showing up in Google.

[00:12:04.390] - Mariah Magazine
Yeah. And this page right here will change depending on the plugins that you have on your site. Yeah. So this right here is actually a Beaver Builder.

[00:12:15.440] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Okay.

[00:12:16.250] - Mariah Magazine
And so no, I don't want my Beaver Builder templates to show up in search results. So whichever plug-ins, which additional functionality you have on your site, that will dictate the options that show up in Yoast here. Then there's media and attachment attachment URLs, Taxonomies Do you want your blog post categories to show up?

[00:12:42.870] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Yeah. I do want to go go back... I want to just step to media, because if you are hosting your freebie PDF in your media library, you probably don't want that to be searchable on Google where people can find it and get it without signing up for your list. List. So might want to adjust adjust settings or just on the particular media PDF, say, no, make this a no index. And I'm sure we can talk about that.

[00:13:06.570] - Mariah Magazine
Because.

[00:13:07.300] - Liz Stapleton, Host
I've made that mistake too.

[00:13:09.420] - Mariah Magazine
Yeah, for sure. And honestly, best practice. I always suggest that you host your freebies on something else.

[00:13:16.950] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Oh, yeah, I do now.

[00:13:18.260] - Mariah Magazine
Yeah, for sure. Just because if somebody wanted to, they might be able to get access to it since it is in this WordPress database. If you look at the URLs, let's say, of media files, they're easier to guess.

[00:13:36.030] - Liz Stapleton, Host
What.

[00:13:36.430] - Mariah Magazine
They are. But if you go ahead and attach a Google Drive share URL, there's so many different numbers and letters. There's no way that anybody's going to be able to go out and guess those. So for security purposes, I definitely recommend starting a Dropbox or a Google Drive for free programs. Totally easy to use and use that way to share your content and the freebies themselves. But this is also an important thing for your freebie pages. Maybe you only have something that you don't want searchable.

[00:14:10.800] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Yeah, or the thank you page isn't searchable or something.

[00:14:14.450] - Mariah Magazine
Yeah. I will go ahead in just one second and show you how to change those settings and the pages themselves. So this is more so the overall rules for your site. So you can override these overall rules on each page and post and all that fun stuff. Actually, we can go ahead and do... Okay, so we also have the archives. So if you're a single blog post writer, you're going to want to disable the author archives. So if there's only one author on your site, disable that, because what that's going to do, it's actually going to show up as duplicate content, because because your post archive is going to be the exact same as your author archive. But if you have multiple authors, you're going to want to enable these.

[00:15:13.460] - Mariah Magazine
Breadcrumbs, this is just like a personal preference, depending on how your content is laid out. And then RSS feed. Do people still utilize this as much?

[00:15:27.110] - Liz Stapleton, Host
I have no idea. I'd say that I do, do, but- do?

[00:15:30.600] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Do? I I can't say say I do.

[00:15:32.880] - Mariah Magazine
Oh, okay. Yeah, yeah.

[00:15:34.810] - Liz Stapleton, Host
I probably said something up forever ago that I totally.

[00:15:38.740] - Mariah Magazine
Forgot about. Yeah, yeah, for sure. I remember when I got into the industry, RSS feeds were still like a really big thing. But if you are into the RSS feed, do you know that there are settings for Yoast in the settings page as well. Okay, so let's see. I think that they might have... Yeah, they disabled the Search Console accessibility in Yoast. So Social, go ahead and put in your social profiles. What this does is this tells Google, Hey, this website is associated with this social media profile. So it is best practice to go ahead and give Google a heads up on that. And then there's certain settings for each one that you can also also on your pages. So see. I'll just go into one of my posts and show where the settings that I was talking about is. Okay, so so depending on your theme, your Yoast box might be above your content or below your content. And it might be shown like this. It might not be open. So go ahead and make sure that you can click on that to open it. And then this is where that focus key phrase that we were talking about is.

[00:17:10.990] - Mariah Magazine
This box right here is just so the Yoast tool can go ahead and give you an SEO analysis. This isn't whatever you put in here, is then tapping Google on the shoulder and being like, Hey, this is my keyword. That's not quite how it works.

[00:17:29.200] - Mariah Magazine
But best practice is always create a customized SEO title for every single blog post and every single page on your website that you you showing up in search results. And then best practice always try to have your focus key phrase, the main idea of that page or post content in the SEO title and also put it in the meta description. So I know that the SEO analysis always recommends that. So I wouldn't worry too much about getting that green face right right because at the end of the day, you do want your content to be created for your users and not for search bots. That's a huge mistake that I see some people making. They'll reword this SEO title so that it's like super SEO-friendly and they get the green light. But then as a human reading it, I'm like, Wait, what? You know what I mean? It just doesn't really make all too much sense. Sense. Yeah, this is where you go ahead and edit those. But those settings that we were talking about... Let me see. See.. Oh, they're- Advanced.

[00:18:44.540] - Liz Stapleton, Host
They moved them on us.

[00:18:45.900] - Mariah Magazine
Oh, did? Yeah. Advanced. Okay. They did.

[00:18:48.280] - Liz Stapleton, Host
They moved them on us.

[00:18:49.740] - Mariah Magazine
Okay. So, yeah, in this main box, you scroll down a little bit, and you're going to see these advanced settings. So it'll ask you, you, search engines to show this this post search results?

[00:19:01.320] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Yes.

[00:19:03.110] - Mariah Magazine
Should search engines follow links on this post? Yes. And then if you wanted to apply advanced meta robots for this page, you can define certain ones. You don't have to really worry about this. This is pretty advanced.

[00:19:17.810] - Liz Stapleton, Host
But.

[00:19:18.930] - Mariah Magazine
It's mainly this one. So allow search engines to show this post. If this was a freebie page that you didn't want to show up in search search results- Or.

[00:19:26.480] - Liz Stapleton, Host
A link page. You want the the opt page to show up in search, but not like that. Here's where you download page.

[00:19:31.480] - Mariah Magazine
Yes, exactly. Then you're going to want to go ahead and click no for that and then follow links. No, you're not going to want that either. So then you would go ahead and update that. And that is how you keep a whole bunch of your posts actually out of Google.

[00:19:47.190] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Yes. Yeah. And if it was in there and you take it out, you might see some blips here and there, but it'll eventually register. Oh, that's just not part of it anymore.

[00:20:00.500] - Mariah Magazine
Yeah. So I actually recommend after you go ahead and change something like that, I would suggest resubmitting that blog post URL to Google.

[00:20:11.990] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Yeah, through the Google Search Console. We actually just covered that in another session.

[00:20:17.040] - Mariah Magazine
Oh.

[00:20:17.440] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Perfect.

[00:20:17.990] - Mariah Magazine
Yeah, we know how to do that. Yeah, that's awesome. So yeah, I would definitely recommend grabbing this post URL or that page URL that you change the settings and go ahead and update it so Google can can and get those settings right away. Because otherwise Google, it'll figure it out. You know what I mean? They'll come across it eventually, but the web is very vast. So if you just tap Google on the shoulder, Hey, just change this. Go scope it out, then that would probably be best. Okay. I'm going to stop sharing my screen. Okay. Right. Okay. So yeah, those are the main things that I would keep in mind when you're especially downloading Yoast.

[00:21:09.960] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Okay. Yeah, or any similar. I think rank math is another one that's been gaining attention. I'm sure settings are similar, but just to be aware that you do have that control and you you to make those adjustments.

[00:21:22.850] - Mariah Magazine
Yeah. And then if you guys have any questions on that stuff, don't be afraid to go to that tool's tool's website look it up. They have FAQs, they have getting started guides. So if you're going to download the tool, definitely take a few minutes just to learn exactly how that tool works and.

[00:21:42.200] - Mariah Magazine
In order to get the most out of it.

[00:21:45.790] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Yeah. And I think in our plugin session with Julie, she talks about what to look at before you install plugin like you.

[00:21:53.600] - Mariah Magazine
Just- That's so important.

[00:21:55.740] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Yeah. So definitely check those out. You mentioned one of the things not to do is to write for the tool as opposed to the person. What are some other big on-page SEO mistakes people make?

[00:22:08.320] - Mariah Magazine
Okay. So one of the biggest things is keyword stuffing. That we see is that people manipulate their content in order to repeat the same keyword and key phrase over and over again. But the thing is that Google and Google bots are actually getting smarter. So they do understand synonyms. They are being able to read a blog post and understand the main idea of the blog post based on the other content in the blog post.

[00:22:40.620] - Mariah Magazine
So.

[00:22:41.640] - Mariah Magazine
That's really awesome so that you don't have to keep repeating the same thing over and over and.

[00:22:46.640] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Over again. It's annoying to read.

[00:22:49.070] - Mariah Magazine
Yeah. And honestly, at the end of the day, it's your users and your website visitors that determine if your website is useful. It's not Google. Google is just the tool that combines them. Yeah.

[00:23:01.720] - Liz Stapleton, Host
And the thing is, if someone gets on your post and it's just keyword stuff, they're like, This is so so annoying to They're going to bounce. Right? And bounce rate and time on page. And those are all things that contribute to your ranking. So it's better to write for someone. And Google is going to... Because Google, they may put something on the first page, but then if everyone's bouncing from them, they're going to knock it down. They're going to push up the stuff that people are spending time on.

[00:23:26.090] - Mariah Magazine
Yeah, exactly. So it all correlates together. So I.

[00:23:30.970] - Mariah Magazine
Would say that another big mistake that I see with overall SEO and my website growth in general is that people don't take the time to actually get to know their audience. So that's what your entire website and your blog is built upon, is knowing exactly who you serve and then giving them the solution to the problems that you know that they have. So the target audience avatars that a lot of people download, I feel like like they're not as much as they could be. You don't really need to know what Sally Sue is doing in her spare time with her husband on the weekends. You want to know what problems she's having. What problems are she having right now that you can help with? And you want to know how she's explaining those problems and what she thinks the problem and solution are. So that's how you actually get your keywords. You go ahead and you switch the mindset of it like, Hey, if I was my target audience and this is my problem, how would I explain my problem into Google? And what solution would I expect to find? Yeah. So when you really get to know your people, how they word things, what their pain points are, you can translate that information and actually get a lot more from your SEO.

[00:24:49.710] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Besides just doing a mindset switch of how you look at that and try to keyword research, you have some other suggestions on how people can better know their audience to solve their problems?

[00:25:02.790] - Mariah Magazine
Yeah. So I would say, ask them. Talk to your people. You know what I mean? Email marketing is huge. Go ahead and send a survey. Are you on Instagram? Post questions there. Have conversations. Actually, something that I just did is I opened up a few coffee chats to connect with my people so that I can hear exactly how they are explaining their problems. And having that personal connection and just taking a little bit of time out of your way, that's a really awesome way to get to know how people see you, how people view you, and if you're making that solid connection or not, which ends up translating into your SEO. And then it's also like competitor research. See somebody that is doing a similar thing, has a similar audience to you. See what's working for them. See what's not.

[00:25:58.770] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Yeah.

[00:25:59.020] - Mariah Magazine
So yeah, those are definitely some things that like... It's like the research thing.

[00:26:05.620] - Liz Stapleton, Host
And then it's- a lot more work, but put on a summit.

[00:26:09.160] - Mariah Magazine
Yeah.

[00:26:10.430] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Seriously. And then ask questions and people register for it.

[00:26:13.130] - Mariah Magazine
Yeah, for sure. Sure. Like, it's just really taking that time to get to know your people, because in the long run, that's how people are going to start viewing you as an authority. That's how people are going to start recognizing you as the expert, is because they're like, Whoa, she knows exactly what I'm thinking. And then you're like, Yeah, I do. You know what I mean? You're super stoked on it. Yeah.

[00:26:35.300] - Liz Stapleton, Host
No, I like it. Yeah. So knowing your audience is another big mistake people tend to make. So once you start working on improving your SEO, whether that's revisiting your content, making it better, taking down things that aren't supposed to be there or things that just aren't performing well, how do you work on evaluating your SEO progress? Progress?

[00:27:01.070] - Mariah Magazine
So that all depends on your goal for SEO. So I always start the conversation with my clients. I'm like, What is the goal for your SEO? Why do you want to focus on this? Do you want to get more email subscribers? Do you want to get more sales? Do you just want to get more views? So how you evaluate depends on what that goal is. But I would say regardless, Google Analytics is a hands-down must-have. It's that free tool that allows you to dive in and to see exactly where people are coming from, what your bounce rate is, what pages or posts people aren't spending a lot of time on, what pages and posts they are spending a lot of time on. It's those data points that really help you get to know the actions that people are taking on your website, because at the end of the day, that's how how is doing it, too, is from those data, that data, those analytics. And then another thing is going to be your domain authority. Okay. So that's when I mentioned the off page SEO, that's where your domain authority hangs out. So Google, for example, like Oprah Winfrey's website, she probably has a very high domain authority because Google is like, she knows what she's talking about.

[00:28:32.410] - Mariah Magazine
People spend a lot of time on her site. Bigger websites are also linking back to her. So maybe Tony Robbins is also linking back to Oprah Winfrey site, or you know what I mean? The reputation is really, really good with people. But a smaller site that maybe just got launched, Google doesn't know anything about that site. There aren't sites linking back to it. The dwell time, the time that people are spending on the site maybe isn't as long as somebody spending time on an Oprah Winfrey's site. Yeah. So knowing your domain authority is a really, really big thing. That's going to help with benchmarking to see where your SEO score is and how you can manipulate it in a way that's going to help you.

[00:29:23.490] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Okay. And is there a way you can check your domain authority? Yes.

[00:29:27.740] - Mariah Magazine
So if you go to moz.Com, I'm actually actually going here. Me go to that website right now just so I can see exactly what they call it. So you can create a free account, and they'll let you you I think it's 10 searches a month. You don't have to pay for any of their tools, and their tools are quite expensive when it comes to SEO stuff. But if you click on free tools in the top right-hand corner, you can go ahead and enter your URL, analyze your domain. So it's also called the the link explorer, So if you scroll down on their free tools, you can click research with link explorer. So that's going to scan your website and see the domain authority number that google sees and that it associates with your website. And it also gives you a backlink profile. So it'll tell you what other sites are linking back to yours.

[00:30:27.130] - Liz Stapleton, Host
So.

[00:30:27.990] - Mariah Magazine
That is really helpful. And yeah, it's out of a hundred. But I don't want people to freak out if they go ahead and they put their website in and they see that their site's only eight out of a hundred. The only sites that have a crazy number, like in the the 80s, are are insane. So like New York Times, Amazon. You know what I mean? A normal healthy domain authority range for a smaller business or a smaller blog is like 30 . 40 in the 50s. That is a pretty decent domain authority. And then this is also a really awesome way to do competitor research. So you do get those 10 searches a month. Pop your competitors' URL in there. See what their domain authority is. See what other websites are linking back to them. So that might be a good way for you to pitch guest blog posts or press things or get listed in directories. It's this little tool that you can use to see the back end of your your statistics and numbers and all of that off page SEO. Good stuff. Yeah.

[00:31:52.100] - Liz Stapleton, Host
I'm looking at right now. I'm like, I haven't looked at this before. I told you I should have.

[00:31:57.290] - Mariah Magazine
It's super interesting, right? It's a whole new rabbit hole.

[00:32:01.490] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Yeah. No, because I just did my personal finance at the first of all I ever started. And I also really haven't touched in a year. It's a domain of 31, but it's ranking for some stuff. I'm like, like, I need to go take advantage of that fact.

[00:32:17.390] - Mariah Magazine
Yeah. So Moz also has the the I think they call it the Keyword Explorer. So you can see which keywords you're showing up up for, there's not a lot of free  tools available to be able to see that information, which is also why setting up Google Analytics and Google Search Console and connecting them together is very, very important.

[00:32:44.000] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Yeah. Yeah. I've got some work to do. It's great. I'm doing all the sessions sessions with all the I'm like, My to-do list is just growing. And we did a system session so that I can dig into that. But no, I think that's that's I was aware of Moz of but I never really dug into it. And now I've got some digging to do.

[00:33:07.690] - Mariah Magazine
Yeah, their free tools are extremely helpful. And then I guess before we end the session or anything, I do want to mention that the most important part of SEO is getting that foundation set set up, going to see what what starting domain authority is. Check your site for broken links. Run your website and see how fast your pages are loading. These are things that will affect your SEO score. So take the time to understand, do you have Google Analytics set up? Do you have Google Search Console set up? Are they linked together? These foundational things are going to play a very big role in your SEO ranking. So many many people, when start focusing on SEO, they're focusing on keywords, but their foundation isn't set. So all of these little things that they're doing is slipping through the cracks. Yeah. Definitely keep in mind that foundation and giving yourself an audit.

[00:34:18.850] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Yeah, definitely. And we'll get to besides your site and for your your free everyone, I I did want ask, was there a certain tool or resource you recommend in terms of checking for broken links? Because that can be difficult to figure out.

[00:34:32.700] - Mariah Magazine
Oh, yes. Hold on. Let me. I have a favorite, and I've used quite a few. Okay. But I do have a favorite that I use. It is... One second. Second. Broken Link check. Okay.

[00:34:53.350] - Liz Stapleton, Host
That.

[00:34:55.510] - Mariah Magazine
One keeps it like I've used other ones, but the other ones are a little bit more overwhelming. They pull up things that aren't accurate. I think that brokenlinkcheck.Com, definitely it scans your site, and it's the most accurate that I found and the easiest to utilize.

[00:35:14.720] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Okay. Yep. No, good to know. I just wanted to ask that. Are there any other tools or resources besides your site that you would recommend in terms of helping you fix that foundation or set it up?

[00:35:25.860] - Mariah Magazine
Google Search Console is something that you really should take the time to set up. It doesn't take very long, but those Google Analytics and Google Search Console and linking them together is the very first thing that I do for my clients. That is a foundation that I wish that I could dig into and put together for every website on the internet because I think that they are so important.

[00:35:50.450] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Yes. Absolutely. So then I know you do have a great free resource for all our attendees. Can you tell us a little bit about it?

[00:35:57.380] - Mariah Magazine
Yeah. So I do have a free roadmap to successful SEO for you guys to download and you can snag it. And it walks through the overview of all the things that I do with my clients when we're setting up their SEO foundation, when we're working on growing their SEO and all of that fun stuff and everything in between. And it lays it out in a way that you're like, like, I focus on this and it will help you prioritize.

[00:36:23.870] - Liz Stapleton, Host
ok.

[00:36:24.950] - Mariah Magazine
Steps to take. And then I also go over that thing in my DIY SEO course. So it is the foundation of the framework that I basically use with my clients all the time. So I think that it's super, super helpful.

[00:36:39.280] - Liz Stapleton, Host
And the link is below.

[00:36:41.220] - Mariah Magazine
Yeah, especially since there's just so many many components. SEO and there's so much information online that the roadmap really does break it down in a way that makes sense and doesn't make you want to rip your hair out.

She's also the founder of Glitz and Grammar, where she helps lifestyle brands and bloggers, like you, woo their audience with wow-worthy worthy copy, please, a big warm welcome for Marlene Srdic. Marlene, thank you so much for coming back this year.

[00:00:52.990] - Marlene
Yeah, thank you for having me.

[00:00:55.310] - Liz
Absolutely. So, today we're going to be talking about writing mistakes for beginner bloggers because, you know, people went to school, right? But writing for the internet is very different. So what are some of the writing mistakes you see newer bloggers make when it comes to creating content?

[00:01:14.960] - Marlene
Well, the first one definitely is that, like, you learned how to write in school and it's almost like you need to unlearn things that you were taught. And I don't want to say that cause my AP English teacher would probably hate me for that, but I don't know, I just remember writing papers in school and using a thesaurus to like, let's think of a smarter word or a better word or how can we make this sound more professional? And writing for the web is just not like that, and people get really stuck, I think, in this mode where they are using too much jargon and a little bit stiff rather than leaning into conversational copy and something more personable and something that sounds like an actual human would write. 

[00:01:59.400] - Liz
Yeah. And paragraphs that are too long because you learn in school, you've got to have the intro, you've got to have three supporting points and then a conclusion of the paragraph. And that's just not how writing online works.

[00:02:08.910] - Marlene
Yeah, exactly.

[00:02:11.510] - Liz
Okay, so you kind of touched on, you know, instead of trying to sound really smart like you would for school, being conversational, being relatable, what are some ways people can kind of try to retrain themselves to write that way?

[00:02:26.140] - Marlene
You know, something that works really well for some people is trying something like, text to talk or reading it out loud. Once you read something out loud, you can literally hear, like, how stiff your words might sound. And I still do this myself. Like, I'll read the post, like, in WordPress, but then I'll preview it and you read it again, you print it out, it sounds different. Like, there's all these different methods that editors use for whatever reason, just because when your eye is used to seeing something, like multiple times, you'll glaze over things. So if you see it in a different way, like print it out or if you hear it, like something might click there that you wouldn't otherwise. Something else is really simple, is like, use contractions. People, again, they get stuck with this I want to sound professional, but in real life, we use contractions. We use slang depending on your brand and your audience, like, they may speak a certain way and you're going to want to attract them, which means sounding like them.

[00:03:26.290] - Liz
And I want to go back because you did mention jargon.

[00:03:30.940] - Marlene
Yeah.

[00:03:31.520] - Liz
And sometimes, especially if you really been in your space for a long time, you don't even realize what's jargon anymore. So do you have any tips of kind of identifying that so you can make sure your writing is clear?

[00:03:44.290] - Marlene
Ask your best friend, your mom, your sister, your spouse, like, anybody, like if you have someone. I know people get like self-conscious about their writing, but you can literally just pretend you're writing to your friend or ask them if they're in this. They're like, hold up, I don't know what you're talking about. Like, I don't know what this means. And you know, right there. Okay, I need to explain this in layman's term, in like a more approachable way.

[00:04:07.390] - Liz
Yes. Okay, thank you. So first mistake is writing for school rather than for the web. What is another mistake? You see a lot of writers making.

[00:04:18.410] - Marlene
Writing for themselves, I think is another one. I know when Blog started, it was kind of like, dear Diary, I ate this for lunch today, and then I dropped my kids off at school and then I bought this new shirt and that was kind of like what a blog was. And typically, if you're like a business owner or a blogger and influencer, you're probably following other bloggers and influencers. So, you might want to emulate them and you see them writing posts like, this is what I'm reading right now, or this is what I'm loving. But when you're starting out, you don't have an audience. So I don't want to be mean. But nobody cares. They don't know you yet, right? So, They don't really care what books you read or what your favorite thing is. You have to reach the audience first and grow to a certain level before you start writing about, like, me, me, me. And make sure that you're solving their problems and helping them out and that's going to make them more interested in you, anyways.

[00:05:18.260] - Liz
Yeah, I mean I think we touched on this a little bit in your previous session last year, but it doesn't necessarily have to be a huge shift to go from writing for you versus writing for them. Do you have any tips on that?

[00:05:31.540] - Marlene
Yeah, you just reframe it. So, if you're watching this right now and you're freaking out, like, oh my God, all my content is like me, me , me, you can just go back to your content and think about how you can frame it so it helps them. So, you know, if you wrote about, like, five summer reads that you really enjoyed, maybe that post can be like, you know, the best summer beach reads for you to take on your next vacation, and just literally tweaking that language from, like, my favorite to like, you should read this and you should do this, and this is how this will help you.

[00:06:04.990] - Liz
Yeah. And maybe as you read, see how many times you say the word you versus I or me. That might be another just hint that your thought is too much about you, potentially. Okay, so what is, I think what is another mistake that you see a lot of the time?

[00:06:25.540] - Marlene
Whenever we have these conversations, I always think of like, 30. I started with, like, three that I wrote down, and I wrote down so many. One of them that I will say that I see a lot is analysis paralysis, this striving for perfectionism. I see this in Facebook groups a lot, where people are like, how many blog posts do I need before launching my blog? And they're like, just launch it. Yeah, exactly.

[00:06:51.240] - Liz
Yeah. Zero. You don't even need one. Zero.

[00:06:55.650] - Marlene
Yeah, except for, like, your mom, you know, nobody's going to read it.

[00:07:00.760] - Liz
Yes. Yeah.

[00:07:01.330] - Marlene
So just get it out there.

[00:07:03.570] - Liz
Yeah. And I commend people for really doing their research before they dive into blogging, and so that they have a strategy from the get-go that is smart, except for the point where it can be too knowledgeable to take action. I had zero clue what I was doing when I started. I was like, oh, start a blog. And I like did it. And I was like, okay. But now I know, I basically just gave them an affiliate commission for Bluehost, right? But you know, I was like, okay, well, I'm just going to I remember hitting publish on that very first post and being so nervous, and literally no one saw it.

[00:07:42.340] - Marlene
It's like you're writing to a black hole, basically, in the beginning.

[00:07:45.760] - Liz
Yes. Yes. And it's funny because as you build an audience, you will make mistakes and you'll be like, oh, but then you'll fix it. And it's like, not even nearly as nervewracking as that first post was.

[00:07:58.610] - Marlene
Yeah, and not only that, but writing is one of those things that like you just have to keep doing it to get better at it. I can give you all the tips there are, but at the end of the day, like you have to start in order to get better. I mean, I thought I was great ten years ago, and then I read my stuff and I'm like, oh, like, everybody has that feeling, and you're only going to get better the more you do it. Yeah.

[00:08:22.860] - Liz
And two points to that, one, is if you're not looking back on your work from your own cringing, you're not learning. And then two, very few things are permanent blogging. You can update them later.

[00:08:39.160] - Marlene
Yes. Yes.

[00:08:40.610] - Liz
Google loves it. So like, just hit publish. Take imperfect action. Done is better than perfect, and you will learn as you go.

[00:08:48.040] - Marlene
Exactly.

[00:08:49.090] - Liz
Okay, so we've covered a few mistakes. I'm happy to cover a few more if you want, but I also want to talk about some best practices, you know that you might suggest for those people that are, you know, analysis paralysis and how to get out of that besides just being published. What are some best practices for them? Because they're going to need up. They're going to need like, I need a system.

[00:09:10.760] - Marlene
Definitely, just start again. Like, if it makes you cringe, that's okay. Like, you just have to, it does get easier the more you do it every single time. It'll get easier the more you're in a habit of doing it. I think outlines are exceptionally helpful for beginning writers, and a lot of people don't want to start with outlines. I don't know. I mean, even I was resistant to them at the beginning. I was like, I don't need an outline. But it really helps you not just structure your content, but not lose your train of thought, especially as, like, sometimes blog post can get really, really lengthy and you have to make sure that it's, like, structured a certain way and that it makes sense and you're not rambling and losing your reader. So I think outlines are a really great place to start and make sure that you're hitting all your points. And in that sense, that is kind of like something that you can stick with what your English teacher said, is make sure you have your main points and your supporting points and your blog post. But I think that's definitely any writer can use an outline.

[00:10:13.240] - Liz
Yeah, I don't know how people don't use outlines and write posts to be perfect, like I can't imagine it.

[00:10:19.240] - Marlene
Because you'll forget something, right?

[00:10:20.940] - Liz
Yeah.

[00:10:21.300] - Marlene
You'll be forgetting something, or you forget to type in the main point, or you might go off on a tangent, like it really is the backbone of what you're doing. 

[00:10:31.990] - Liz
Yes, okay. Any other sort of best practice tips that you have?

[00:10:39.040] - Marlene
You know, I do, I would say that writing's a great start. Editing is where the magic happens. Really, you know, some people just write and not go through the editing process, and the editing process is actually where everything happens. You might want to let your work breathe for a bit. So if you wrote today, edit it tomorrow, or a couple of days later, see it with fresh eyes. Little things like I mentioned like, printing it out, previewing the post, reading it to a friend. You know these are all little things that you'll be able to fix here and there, and you get better at it as you go along. There's also tons of free programs out there, like Grammarly is excellent. They have, like, a premium version as well, where it'll actually give you even more criticism and it'll tell you little things like, don't use the passive, you know it's passive voice, let's change it to active. Or this is a run-on sentence. So I think those are really helpful. And it's like a free tool, so like why wouldn't you use it?

[00:11:36.970] - Liz
Yeah, I mean, absolutely use the free version. I used the paid version early on, especially when I was freelance writing. You know, I think it helped make me a better writer overall, even though I don't really use it anymore. So, just something to keep in mind in that aspect. So, you mentioned you know kind of writing's the first step, magic is in the editing, and I couldn't agree more. But editing can actually involve a lot of different things besides just like looking for grammar or breaking up paragraphs. Like, what are some editing elements you see people just not even thinking about or you know not doing a great job?

[00:12:20.440] - Marlene
So, trimming the fat is probably the biggest one, is if you can say it succinctly, say it succinctly like, less is more. And sometimes people ramble and they may not even notice. And if you're like, I think people get really obsessed with this SEO, like hitting a target word count, which is great, but you can't be just writing fluff either. So, there is a fine line. And like typically, when I'm editing, most of what I'm doing is just leaving extra words that don't need to be there or modifiers that aren't making the sentence better. That's a little bit harder to do as a beginner, I think, is trying to see what words don't need there. But primarily, I still work with writers who I outsource things to and I'm, delete, delete, like doesn't need to be there, and it just makes it, like, snappier.

[00:13:08.740] - Liz
Yeah, I like that. Okay, one thing I do want to ask you about, because I think it's becoming more and more prevalent within the blogging sphere is AI, and using AI to help write blog posts. And I think it's a great tool to help write, but I think the magic still is very much in the editing. And I'm just curious what your thoughts are on that, you know the best way to use AI, if you think you should be using it at all. Just kind of your opinion on AI and writing.

[00:13:36.410] - Marlene
That's such a like million dollar question.

[00:13:39.420] - Liz
It is. I know

[00:13:40.000] - Marlene
So, I definitely have thoughts on this. I trialed a tool once. I did a trial because there was a lot of buzz. And I found that it was helpful in, like, if you don't know where to start your post, it kind of gives you, like, an idea of where to start. But ultimately, I didn't really think it was throwing out anything super useful other than maybe a generic introduction. It can't do the research for you, and really, if you're providing information, then you have to do the research. And it kind of, I found, like, it was like spinning content. So, I mean, if you really want to use it, like, to help you with an introduction or to maybe get some ideas, I guess you could use it for that. I can see how it's helpful for marketing copy. I know that they have like, you know the framework that will say like, attention, you know, whatever, interest, desire, that thing. But I mean I don't love AI. What can I say? I just don't.

[00:14:42.560] - Liz
Yeah, yeah. you know, so I don't love writing. So, actually, I really like using just to get like words on a page and it almost never ends up looking like what it spit out, you know, but it gets over that blank page sort of you know, even with an outline for that.

[00:15:04.750] - Marlene
So for that, my biggest tip is to not start at the beginning. So just start like, somewhere in the middle. I think even I sometimes don't know where to start. And the intro is like the hardest thing. So if you're stuck on an intro, like, yes, the AI can help you. Or don't write the intro. Like, start somewhere kind of in the middle. You have an outline, right? So, you know you can fill in like, the other stuff. And then once you're kind of in a flow, then you can go back and write your introduction.

[00:15:31.240] - Liz
I've been blogging for eight years and that's the first time I've ever heard that. And that is genius.

[00:15:36.040] - Marlene
Try it. Let me know how it works if you like it.

[00:15:38.620] - Liz
I will. I will. I'm like, oh, that makes perfect sense.

[00:15:43.420] - Marlene
There's no rules that you have to start at the beginning, right? 

[00:15:48.280] - Liz
That's very true. And that's the thing, especially, I wouldn't consider myself an analysis paralysis person, but especially if you are like, there's no hard and fast rules. You can make your own rules. I think it's another kind of point to remember. Any other sort of things that people should avoid when writing or best practices or mistakes that you think is helpful to someone who's trying to get into a blogging rhythm?

[00:16:13.990] - Marlene
I would say, I don't want to go, this could be a whole other workshop in itself. But I don't think people especially getting to pay enough attention to their headline, which is arguably like the most important part. And if you don't nail your headline, then no one's going to click on your post. So, then you just spent all this time and energy writing in this blog post and no one even clicked on it because your headline just fell flat. So that's another one where I feel like you can write it later or work on it after the fact if you're feeling stuck. There's like tons of headline generator tools. I think those are actually really helpful. And that's, I guess, a form of AI. I love those. They're super fun to get the wheels turning. Tons of free resources online to go with those. But I feel like I see a lot of headlines that are really vague or they're just not exciting enough. They don't incite emotion, they don't make me want to get, they don't make me want to click. And that's really the most important part, right? If you wrote 3000 words and your headline isn't there, then no one is going to read it.

[00:17:16.760] - Liz
Yeah. I will say I struggle with trying to create a great headline that's not too long because it gets cut off.

[00:17:24.790] - Marlene
That's okay. I write some long too, because I, you know something that I like to do is scroll at night on my iPad, like news. And you see all the headlines and, like, look at them. And the more you read them, you know, that improves your writing itself to just reading. You'll kind of see they write longer headlines. They use a lot of numbers. They can use a lot of things that make you curious, like, oh, top ten this, wait, till you see number three. And you're like, what's number three? Now I want to know. So, I think just seeing, even just scanning those passively in bed kind of like, gets you into that, seeps into your mind. 

[00:17:59.610] - Liz
Yeah. And I think a lot of people say, write multiple ones before you decide on the one you're going to use because that can just help get you know things moving.

[00:18:07.770] - Marlene
Yeah, get things flowing. Yeah.

[00:18:10.240] - Liz
All right. Any final tips? You know where can people find you, what? Yeah.

[00:18:18.710] - Marlene
So, you can find me. I'm sure you'll have links. You can find me, glitz-grammar.com. If anybody is interested in fashion and lifestyle, then you can find me on lifewithmar.com. If you are just starting out, I do have a free blog post template that you can grab to help you relate with that structure and that outline. It's literally just called the perfect blog post and where your headlines should be, where your sub-headlines to be. So that way you know exactly how to write the post. 

[00:18:47.220] - Liz
Yes. Because it really does matter. You want to make sure you're using the right heading, tags and everything like that. Otherwise, it can get really confusing for people, so.

[00:18:54.790] - Marlene
Yeah.

[00:18:55.190] - Liz
Definitely, go check that out. Links are below. And you know thank you again, Marlene, so much for coming back and sharing your knowledge.

[00:19:02.400] - Marlene
Yeah, thank you so much for having me, it was so fun.

[00:00:03.650] - Liz Stapleton
All right, guys. I'm super excited to have this next speaker back. She's spoken multiple times. She's a former magazine editor turned content creator and entrepreneur. In her 20 years in media, she's been editor-in-chief of multiple publications and had bylines in publications like BBC Travel, Rachel Ray. And as a publisher, her fashion blog, Life with Mar, reaches over 100,000 women monthly across all networks. She's also the founder of Glitz & Grammar, teaching lifestyle brands and bloggers how to reach their ideal audience through WOW, where they copy a big warm welcome back to Marlene Srdic.

[00:00:42.350] - Marlene Srdic
Thank you.

[00:00:44.310] - Liz Stapleton
Yes, I'm super excited to have you back. We're going to be talking about outsourcing, which I feel like... Which is not something I've actually done, really, for writing. I've tested the waters here and there, and then it just didn't quite work out, probably because I was making some of the mistakes you're going to share with us. So where should people start if they want to start outsourcing? And then let's start there and then we'll get to mistakes.

[00:01:09.810] - Marlene Srdic
I think... So one of the reasons I wanted to talk about this today is because of what you said. I feel like I've seen it in Facebook groups all the time. People test the waters and it doesn't work out and they're frustrated. And it's just it's really common. And honestly, one of the most common reasons is that you're maybe not even ready yet. I think that people under estimate outsourcing. It sounds like a good idea. Hey, I've got this writing that I no longer want to do. Why don't I just give it to someone else? You don't even realize that it's a whole other project now in itself. It is a project now that you have to manage because you got to find the writer, you got to hire them, you've got to manage them, you've got invoices to process, contracts to send out, emails back and forth, questions to answer. If you don't have the time to do that or you're not prepped from the get-go, then you're already being set up to fail, unfortunately. It can be really overwhelming. I think that even that starting point is where a lot of people are just like, I don't have the time for this.

[00:02:07.850] - Marlene Srdic
If you're outsourcing, and that's just outsourcing for writers, but even if you want someone to come in to your WordPress or whatever on the back-end, you got to have all that stuff documented in some SOPs. Tell them every little thing. How do you want it formatted? How do you want it to look? How do they log in? All these little details, because they live in our heads, we're doing it all the time, we just assume assume that other people know, and that's not the case. You got to be prepared, whether you're outsourcing just for writing or someone's logging into the back-end and tell them every single little thing that you expect. If you want them to fill out Yoast SEO, you have to have that written down. If you want them to fill out the alt text on the images, tell them to do that, number one. Tell them what alt text is, because we're just making assumptions here. Just because somebody's a writer, it doesn't necessarily they're logged in on the back-end, and It doesn't mean that they know what it is that you want. You just got to be prepared from the get-go, have realistic expectations that it is going to be a project to manage.

[00:03:10.130] - Marlene Srdic
Not trying to scare you off from doing it, but that you're prepped from the get-go with your SOPs in place and a way to track the project, a way to track this is what's coming in, this is when it's due, this is when I'm going to edit back, this is when I'm going to get it published. If you already have a content plan in place, then you're slotting it in there. But just make sure that you're really prepped and ready to go and have the time for it before you even get to actually outsourcing.

[00:03:36.990] - Liz Stapleton
Yeah, and I thought I was like, okay, I was a freelance writer for years myself. So coming at it from the other side, I've got some perspective and I definitely had some of those things, but I just didn't set the necessary boundaries to be like, Well, you wrote way more than I said I wanted and I was willing to pay for, things like that. That was clearly a mistake on my end. What are some mistakes you see people making when they're working to outsource besides not having a process written down? We'll come back to that. But what are other big mistakes people are often making?

[00:04:14.730] - Marlene Srdic
I think not having a content strategy is another one. It can be with writing, it can be difficult to manage or evaluate your ROI. If you're not clear on what your goals are, then you might end up being frustrated, but every piece of content should have one. It's very easy if you're outsourcing email marketing because you're going through a launch, well, then you can evaluate your click-through rate and your purchases and all that. But if you are just having a post on your blog, it's a lot harder to measure the ROI. Just having a good content strategy in place, I think, is also really helpful, really knowing what your goals are. We all have to have informational content that lives on our websites just because that's what readers expect. And if that's what you're outsourcing because you need that, then that's great. Don't be mad that it's not making tons of money on banner ad traffic because that's not what the goal was for that. So I think just in general, even when it's not outsourcing, just having a good idea of what your goals are before you create any piece of content, I think it'd be really helpful.

[00:05:22.020] - Liz Stapleton
Okay. Yeah, I like that. Is it going to be something that you're hoping to get lots of affiliate link clicks, or is it meant to drive traffic for display ads? Is it meant to pre-sell a product in a way or get people to join your newsletter? There's lots of different things a blog post can accomplish. And we're just talking about in the context of writing, so I'm just going to say blog post. But you need to know what it is and it can't do everything. So just being very clear and specific in that goal, I like that. When you're outsourcing, because there's... When I was a freelance writer, AI wasn't really a thing, at least not to the extent it is today. I'd be like, Man, it'd be so much easier to be a freelance writer. I mean, you get that rough draft, and then obviously, you make it your own human authorship. But where do you draw the line? Do you let freelance writers use AI? Are you using AI yourself? How do you manage that aspect of it?

[00:06:23.650] - Marlene Srdic
I mean, I would say that's a personal choice. I wouldn't really... I mean, if I'm hiring a writer, I'm hiring a writer, I'm not hiring AI. That being said, I think I'm not saying AI is not helpful. It's great for helping you come up with ideas. It can be really helpful for an outline. If you're going to send one to a writer or not in your brief, that's your choice. I think that can help with your expectations, too. But as far as writers using AI, it feels like cheating. But I don't have a problem with it if you're using it for brainstorming title ideas. That's really helpful.

[00:07:00.240] - Liz Stapleton
That's how I use it myself. Yeah, I do, too.

[00:07:03.380] - Marlene Srdic
I do, too, and it's really helpful. I feel like nine times out of 10, I'll ask AI for a list of 10 titles, and I ended up piecing together number two, five, and seven. But it still was helpful. Even if I didn't use the exact thing. It's helpful. So I wouldn't tell writers not to use it. And if you want to use AI, same thing. It's still a project that has to be managed, and you still have to know what you're using it for, what your ultimate goal is.

[00:07:37.120] - Liz Stapleton
Okay. You used a term that I feel like if people weren't freelance writers themselves or they haven't managed, they wouldn't recognize. You said a brief. So can you explain what a brief is and how it differs from SOP?

[00:07:50.510] - Marlene Srdic
Sure. So one mistake that I feel like people make is not having their expectations aligned. And that can really be from a lack of communication, really clearly communicating exactly what you want. As you mentioned, word count, how you want it formatted, what the article is about, all of that, you would send that in a writer's brief, and that's really going to help eliminate some of that back and forth because you're being clear on exactly what it is that you want and what you expect. Some people will include an outline in a writer's brief. That's up to you if you want to. In the past, I've done it where maybe I do outlines in the beginning, and then once the writer gets to know what I expect in the style, then maybe I don't supply the outline anymore. If it's a really long, complicated article, then maybe I submit the outline. The outline is actually a great way to use AI. I mentioned before having time for the project. You got to assign the content. Well, maybe you have AI draw the outline for you and then you send that over into the final brief that you send to the writer.

[00:08:57.460] - Marlene Srdic
You can have AI do the writer's brief as well.

[00:09:00.510] - Liz Stapleton
Okay, I like that. And then SOP is more like how they submit the things, the processes involved in actually the formatting and stuff, correct?

[00:09:10.460] - Marlene Srdic
Yeah. Do you want them to email it to you? Do you want it in a Google Doc? Do you want it in a Word doc? Do you want them to put it in WordPress? There's so many questions that... Just again, like I said, eliminate some of that back and forth and save time to really streamline it. If you have it all decided beforehand and then documented in your SOPs, and then when you send over your writer's brief or your writer's guidelines, then that will really help clarify to everyone what the expectations are.

[00:09:40.160] - Liz Stapleton
I like that. Because as you mentioned, a lot of times these processes are things we don't even think about. They just live in our head. We just do them. How do you recognize, Oh, this is something I need to write down so someone else can do it? And how do you actually... That's the thing is I don't remember to actually write it down.

[00:09:58.410] - Marlene Srdic
I would say it's a living, breathing document. So if somebody asks me, then I'm like, okay, I forgot that it's obvious to me. It's not obvious. Then I'll go back in. So I have one in Notion, and I'll just link it out to writers that I work with. And when I send them that, I'll just update it as needed as things change. Okay.

[00:10:20.250] - Liz Stapleton
All right. Moving on from the documentation, how would you recommend people going about finding the people they want to outsource to? Because it's a big wide internet world out there.

[00:10:34.100] - Marlene Srdic
Yeah, it is. I mean, it is a little bit of a get what you pay for space. On the lower end, you're going to get more similar to what you get from AI. On the higher end, you're probably going to get better results. That being said, everybody's on a budget, but just keep that in mind as far as how much editing you want to do. I think it's unrealistic to not expect to do any editing. You should always edit your content before it goes up. You always got to put your personal flair, your stamp on it, and just refine it. I feel like when people outsource, they think that you don't have to edit, and you should always be editing your content. But as far as finding writers, Facebook groups, there's places like Upwork, Fiverr, LinkedIn. I usually hire a lot, actually, via Facebook groups or people that I know, recommendations from maybe other publishers or from LinkedIn.

[00:11:28.090] - Liz Stapleton
Okay. What would you is a price range? Because I feel like maybe a lot of people don't realize how much, how little it can cost versus how much it can cost. And as you said, you get what you pay for. But what's the starting point and where it's more high-end?

[00:11:46.480] - Marlene Srdic
It could be anywhere from 10 to 20 cents a word to a dollar, a dollar fifty, two dollars per word. Some people will charge for a project. I have seen three to four cent per word writers, but I personally I wouldn't. If I'm going to outsource, you don't want to get into a situation where you outsource and then you're so frustrated that you're like, I could have just done this myself. That's not what you want. It is supposed to be helpful, even if you're doing the editing, even if you have to send the brief and do all this stuff. You still want it to be helpful and put you one step forward.

[00:12:25.750] - Liz Stapleton
Okay, so walk me through what a potential workflow would work like or would look like if you were outsourcing.

[00:12:33.370] - Marlene Srdic
So again, this is going to depend on if you want to outsource the whole thing. No, everyone is different.

[00:12:37.500] - Liz Stapleton
But just give me an example of one.

[00:12:39.240] - Marlene Srdic
So I'll give you an example. So a writer I already work with, I have writers now. I work for so long that I could just be like, this is the title and just be like, go with it. But typically, if it's somebody new, I would give them a little brief on what I expect, maybe title outlined. I almost always will include sources. Consult these sources or similar to to help inform your content. Or I might post links to other websites, like check out these for reference. I want it to be formatted like this, or I want it to contain, not to copy, but just inspiration, to be similar, either in structure or information or look to other sites. I think that's actually one of the most helpful things you can do is just be really clear like, Hey, I want it to look like this, but put our spin on then you would obviously go with your agreement, whatever agreement or contract that you have, negotiate your rate.

[00:13:38.340] - Liz Stapleton
Always have a contract.

[00:13:39.730] - Marlene Srdic
Always have a contract in place unless you're doing some ongoing work. But you should always have a contract in place. I think that's basically it.

[00:13:49.730] - Marlene Srdic
Then it comes in, I would edit, either send it back or not, and then publish my post.

[00:13:54.780] - Liz Stapleton
If you're outsourcing, should there be a specific amount of content you're trying to... Do you see this as a publisher yourself of like, If I want to get this many pieces of content done, I'm going to outsource at least this many?

[00:14:14.690] - Marlene Srdic
Not necessarily. I guess it depends on your workload, how much you want to put in yourself and what your budget is, really.

[00:14:25.220] - Liz Stapleton
Yeah, very true. All right, so what is... I mean, we talked about some mistakes people make and you need to set the rules, and you need to be very clear about them, and that's where a lot of the problems arise. If a problem arises, what is the next step? I mean, the contract, I mean, if there's a breach of contract, that's a whole other thing. But how quickly are you responding to they didn't understand? Are you going to have to scrap that draft? What is the actual management of that look like?

[00:14:55.560] - Marlene Srdic
I have scrapped drafts before. If it's so off the mark, and I feel like it's just not worth going back and forth. I've just called it a loss and scrapped it altogether. I think one way that people can avoid that altogether, that's often overlooked too, is issuing a writer's test before you hire somebody. And this is pretty standard practice, just in the publishing industry. And I think, since we think we're smaller publishers, we don't have to do this. But you can just pay a very nominal fee and give a couple of people a writer's test and evaluate it. And then, before you even make your hire, I like to do this. And it'll give you a good idea- I will say that.

[00:15:39.030] - Liz Stapleton
No one should work for free.

[00:15:40.270] - Marlene Srdic
Yeah, no, that's what I meant. Pay a nominal fee.

[00:15:42.840] - Liz Stapleton
No, I just like to be very clear, because people are like, Well, it's part of the applications. No, that's work.

[00:15:48.240] - Marlene Srdic
No, no. You pay them for the work. Yeah. But at least you get an idea of how they work, how quickly they respond to your emails, how responsive they are. Did they turn it in on deadline or If you're not, you get an idea right away. Then you can also evaluate, obviously, their writing skills and if it's on point or not, if you can give them feedback from there. I think it just establishes from the start a much stronger relationship, and you're going to be less frustrated with, Oh, I tried this writer and they sucked. Oh, this person didn't get it. Well, sample a couple of people out. I've put out writing tests and skipped on two out of three people. Imagine if I had hired those two out of three people I would have wasted my money and my time on them when I could have just already not hired them based on the test.

[00:16:38.920] - Liz Stapleton
Yeah. No, I do that, not so much with writing, but I do tend to outsource transcripts for this summit. And so because there's so many, it's 50 sessions around there. And so I will be like, hey, guys, I'm looking for contractors to do this, and I will do a test, which I pay.

[00:16:58.810] - Marlene Srdic
And I make sure they're all around the same length and whatnot, and then I go through and stuff.

[00:17:04.050] - Liz Stapleton
So testing, I think, is a paid test to see if they're going to fit for the work itself is always a good idea. What haven't we covered that people should know about outsourcing writers in particular?

[00:17:18.500] - Marlene Srdic
You should always have some writer's guidelines. If you don't have any, then you should not be outsourcing yet.

[00:17:24.430] - Liz Stapleton
What goes into a writer's guideline?

[00:17:27.310] - Marlene Srdic
Your writer's guidelines is going to be your little brand bible that says everything, from your voice, your tone, the style of your content, your demographic, who they're writing for.

[00:17:39.380] - Liz Stapleton
Do you use Oxford comma or not.

[00:17:39.460] - Marlene Srdic
Yeah. Do you use Oxford Common or no? Do you use emojis or not? Are you writing to Gen Z or are you writing to boomers? People need to know this information. I have a writer's guidelines that I put together. In here, that's where you can put the stuff like how to submit the content. You want a Word doc or Google But you should have this anyways. If there's one takeaway from this conversation, you should have this for yourself anyways. The thing about writer's guidelines is you can give this to ChatGPT and you can give it to Claude AI. If you're frustrated with the content that you're getting out of AI, and it doesn't sound like you will put together a whole guide and tell them, This is the voice, this is the tone, this is the demographic. We use first person, we don't use first person, we use Oxford commas, all those little things that, again, lives in your head and you think other people just might infer, you need to actually have it documented.

[00:18:37.090] - Liz Stapleton
Yes, I like that. All right. So where can people find out more about you? I know you have something for them. Tell us all about it.

[00:18:45.900] - Marlene Srdic
So you can find me at glitzgrammar.com. If the idea of writer's guidelines sounds overwhelming for you, I do have a template that you can grab for free that will help you create your own. And then just a little example of what it should look like. That way you have a good place to start, whether it's for yourself or ChatGPT, or you're ready to outsource to Writers.

[00:19:06.290] - Liz Stapleton
Yes, and all those links are going to be below this video, or they'll be on this page. Definitely, go check that out. Then I think you also have something if people end up grabbing the All Access Pass and the speaker bonus bundle, whatever formation that tends to become. But what do you have for that?

[00:19:23.830] - Marlene Srdic
I do have a little Writing Secrets Masterclass. As you mentioned. I talk a lot about writing with with my readers and just some things to help you create better content.

[00:19:34.500] - Liz Stapleton
Fantastic. So guys, definitely check that out if that is of interest to you. Marlene, again, thank you so much for coming back and sharing more of your knowledge with the Blogger Breakthrough Summit. I'm always excited to have you and learn from you. Thank you.

[00:19:46.340] - Marlene Srdic
Thanks for having me again.

**Transcript:**
[00:00:13.430] - Marlene
Hello, everyone. I am so excited to be here today as part of the Blogger Breakthrough Summit to give you a little blog writer's bootcamp. This workshop is going to share with you three secrets to writing engaging content. So, you can up level your writing skills. Now, today, we're going to go over three major things that you can expect to learn. The first is the biggest mistake that I see a lot of beginning bloggers make.

[00:00:42.530] - Marlene
Some of you may be familiar with that, some of you may not. The second is why your blog posts are not getting read and how to fix that because we're not going to spend the time writing these posts if nobody's going to read them, right, unless is one of the secrets to writing engaging content online.

[00:01:01.890] - Marlene
Now, if you are wondering if this is for you, I will just go quickly through who this is exactly for. This is probably for you. If you are a small business owner or a blogger/content creator who struggles with consistency. I have found personally that with my clients, consistency is probably one of the biggest hurdles and the biggest things they struggle with. Maybe you feel like you've got a message to share with the world, but you don't exactly feel super confident in your writing skills. Or maybe you just want to learn how to grow a brand of loyal and engaged clients and readers because it's not all about the numbers, right?

[00:01:41.460] - Marlene
Like we want an engaged audience, engaged clients, engaged readers because that's what truly makes a difference. Now, if you are wondering, who the heck am I to be teaching you about writing, I figured I'd do a quick little introduction. So, my name is Marlene and I am a former magazine editor turned content creator and online entrepreneur. I have worked in the magazine industry for nearly 15 years and was the editor in chief of four magazines of four, launching my own fashion and lifestyle blog and a copywriting business too.

[00:02:15.120] - Marlene
So, I typically work with lifestyle brands to help them stand out using their voice online, with content coaching and with copywriting too. And as I mentioned, I also have a personal fashion and lifestyle blog that I started on the side. So, throughout my career, I've added and written like literally hundreds and hundreds of articles from BBC Travel to Phoenix Magazine at Modern Luxury to Scottsdale every day with Rachel Roy, like seriously, so many. I always just kind of knew that I wanted to be a magazine editor and wanted to go into the publishing industry.

[00:02:51.130] - Marlene
So that's what I did straight out of College and things kind of changed at some point. I think it was about ten, maybe 15 years ago, the industry totally shifted and just like that, blogs were born and everything started moving online. And I'm not really one to not roll with the punches and adapt to, I went online too. And honestly, I had a pretty strong journalistic background I definitely had the experience.

[00:03:19.560] - Marlene
I should have been primed for success, but I wasn't. And to be honest, my fashion blog kind of sucked, and you think of my connections, and you would think that knowing how the PR world works and knowing how to write a great story, that I would have hit the ground running and been super successful right away. But I just wasn't. That's not how that story was. I kind of just tried doing everything under the sun and that included writing about everything.

[00:03:50.960] - Marlene
So, I just write about fashion. I had recipes, I had home decor, I had a little bit of all of it. I tried doing things like Friday five and creating thin content because I saw that working for other people where they had beautiful photography and two to three lines of text. I did not have beautiful photography, and it just wasn't getting me anywhere. This is probably the most embarrassing one.

[00:04:14.830] - Marlene
I actually tried to make my blog bilingual. At some point. I was writing posts half in English with Spanish underneath, because again, I saw somebody else doing it and it was working for them, and I thought, why not?  And you know I really honestly got stuck in the cycle of just copying what everyone else was doing and not staying true to who I was. Then I was like, enough is enough.

[00:04:39.670] - Marlene
I found my voice and everything changed. After that, things started to grow pretty quickly. And I started being able to consistently land paid partnerships with brands while under 10K. I was a pretty small creator, and I was still getting paid partnerships with major household names like Wayfair, Sachs, Olay, Huggies and many, many more. And it's been an absolutely incredible journey. And I've asked what it is with brand managers. I always ask for feedback, and the number one thing that they've always told me is that they love the quality of my content.

[00:05:16.410] - Marlene
So, something I want you to take away today is that high quality storytelling and high quality images really are the keys to success. And you know you can do this even with a small brand, it's more than just the perfect feed. With the right words, you can grow your audience. What does that translate into?

[00:05:37.790] - Marlene
And why do we want this? Well, you want a more engaged and loyal following of customers and fans. If you're a creator, you're going to get more brand deals, aka, more money in your pocket and increased visibility for your blog and your business as you continue to grow in a way that helps you stand out from the crowd. Now I'm just curious where you are, how confident do you feel in your writing skills? Drop your answers in the chat.

[00:06:04.080] - Marlene
I'm curious to know. Are you more like one to three? Not so much. Are you semi confident? Are you like, I've got this?

[00:06:12.960] - Marlene
I know exactly what I'm doing.

[00:06:17.590] - Marlene
If you're on the lower end, I just want to bust a myth for right here, you might be thinking writing is an art and it cannot be learned. And to an extent, I can see why people think writing is an art. But to be honest, writing is a craft and with the right frameworks, teachings and techniques in place, anybody can learn. So, as we dive into the workshop, I hope that you shut down your distractions and can be fully present as that is how you're going to get the most out of this and be sure to stick around until the end.

[00:06:50.060] - Marlene
I do have a bonus that is totally free and is made just for attendees.

[00:06:56.530] - Marlene
So, the first secret to writing engaging content secret number one is to make sure you solve somebody's problems. Make sure that your content is about them, and it's not about you. Content is the core of all blogs. It's not the design of your website. It's not who your website host is. It's not how fast it is.

[00:07:17.740] - Marlene
It's not the perfect Instagram feed and the filter and the logo and all this stuff. It's content, you guys, it comes back to your content. I mean, by definition, a blog is a written piece of content online, and somehow we all stopped focusing on the actual writing and started prioritizing everything else. And this is something I'm really just personally passionate about because I feel so many people just going in circles about their site speed and their logos and finding the perfect fonts instead of focusing on the actual writing.

[00:07:51.190] - Marlene
A blog is a medium to tell a story, to share your content.

[00:07:55.350] - Marlene
And here's a fact. It's competitive. I mean the average blog post today has over 1200 words. That's 53% more than the average blog post six years ago. I know this because I used to get so much traffic to my blog and I could throw up 150 words in a post and I'd get traffic, and now it's obviously nowhere near that.

[00:08:16.630] - Marlene
But this also means you need to know two really important things. The first is how to put together a compelling post, and the second is that it's not enough to have a lot of words. They have to be good ones. They can't be fluff, right? You can't just write 500 words and then just stuff the rest until you reach the 1200.

[00:08:36.160] - Marlene
It's got to be good. So, if you want your blogging efforts to pay off and I'm sure you do, because that's why you're here, then you really need to prioritize and produce amazing content. And one way to do that is to make it about them and not about you. I see this in particular with beginning bloggers is that you focus a little bit too much on your own likes and experience, and instead you need to focus on someone else's problem. That is one of the easiest ways to turn around your writing. And you can screenshot this, or you can write this in your workbook or whatever you have handy, but I'm going to repeat it again.

[00:09:13.660] - Marlene
The easiest way that you can do it become better is to make it about them and not you. And one simple way to do this is to reframe your post in the publishing world. We just call this choosing another angle of your story. So if you're sitting here right now thinking, oh my God, all my posts are about me, not them. Don't panic.

[00:09:32.900] - Marlene
I'm going to show you a really quick solution. Reframe the angle of your story. Let's say you have a story that my favorite summer reads. You can reframe this to ten must read books for that summer vacation. Honestly, the contents of this post are probably identical.

[00:09:51.490] - Marlene
The only thing that changed is that the title here is a little bit more focused on them versus you. This is also better for your SEO for your Google search because no one is going to go into Google and type what your favorite summer reads are, but they are probably going to look for great books to take on a summer vacation, and that's an opportunity for your blog post to come up. Another example is if you have an article that you're writing on my clean beauty favorites. Again, unless you're a very successful influencer when you have a huge following, a lot of people are probably not going to care what your clean beauty favorites are. But you can write the exact same post and tweak the angle of it and tweak the headline and make it the five best clean mascara options, according to Beauty Bloggers.

[00:10:39.110] - Marlene
Now, this title is incredibly clear. It's succinct.

[00:10:42.410] - Marlene
I know exactly what I'm going to get. Not only is it clean beauty, it's clean mascara options, and five of the best. That's super specific, very important in titles, which spoiler alert we're talking about soon. And it also has a modifier at the end of the title, according to Beauty Bloggers. Now, adding that gives us a certain amount of clout and expertise that you know that you're going to find in the post and you haven't even clicked on it yet.

[00:11:11.570] - Marlene
So, the second secret to getting engagement content, which you probably guessed we're going to talk about is getting the click. We're going to talk about two things here and that's great headlines and structure and how these are the tools to success. Great headlines are not made by accident. These are very very intentional. And if you can't get the click, your blog post won't be read period.

[00:11:40.570] - Marlene
End of story. Harsh truth, you guys. If you can't get the click, if you don't spend the time working on your headline, it doesn't matter if this is the most epic piece of content you've ever written. It doesn't matter if this is like a Pulitzer Prize winning thing. If no one clicks on your article, no one's going to read it and it starts with your headline.

[00:12:01.670] - Marlene
I'd love to know how much time you spend on your headline if you want to drop it in the chat. I don't know if you knew this, but a lot of experts recommend up to 50% of the time it took to write your story to write your headline. So, this is a small workshop, but I do want you to walk away with a couple of tips on how to work on excellent headlines for you to consider. They should always be clear and compelling.

[00:12:28.190] - Marlene
They also are strong when they evoke an emotional response, and this can be any kind of emotional response. This might be a headline that makes you feel happy and excited. It might make you angry. It might make you sad. It might make you scared.

[00:12:41.350] - Marlene
But next time you're browsing the Internet, think about how headline makes you feel and how that gut reaction made you click or not click. The last one element of an excellent headline is invoking curiosity. It makes readers want to click to read more. The only thing you want to be careful of is being vague because you can invoke curiosity, but you can still be clear and compelling. So, here's a couple of examples, because when it comes to headlines, it really is best to see by example.

[00:13:13.150] - Marlene
This headline is quirky clever, but it's so vague. One potato, two potatoes, three potatoes, four. I have no idea what this post is about. If I land on this person's website and I see it, I'm not going to click on it because I don't know what it's going to be about, and you have to be able to somewhat promise the reader this is what you're going to get if you click on the story.

[00:13:38.850] - Marlene
Here's an example of a truly excellent headline that's clear. It's compelling and it makes me curious. 38 Most Popular Egg Recipes for morning, noon and night. So, someone else may have titled this egg recipes. And yes, I would know I'm getting egg recipes, but this tells me I'm getting egg recipes that I can make in the morning for lunch and even late night.

[00:14:03.200] - Marlene
Okay. Not only am I getting egg recipes, but I'm getting 38. And I'm not just getting 38, I'm getting 38 of the most popular egg recipes. Well, these egg recipes must be amazing if they're the most popular, and that makes me curious. So I'm going to click on and read that post.

[00:14:23.230] - Marlene
Here's another example. This is kind of like the previous one where you could have just named it egg Recipes. This one is just named Personal Makeup Lessons. Yes, I have an idea what it's about. It's about personal makeup lessons.

[00:14:35.780] - Marlene
I don't feel excited about it, and it doesn't invoke curiosity. So, what I did is I just copied the word the keyword, which is probably personal makeup lessons for this person's blog, and I pasted it into Google. And these are two that stood out to me. Wired makeup classes have gone virtual, and we tried one out. Well, I know it's about makeup classes. That's clear.

[00:14:58.430] - Marlene
We tried one out, that makes me curious. I'm compelled to click on the post and see what was your experience like. The next one is also it's a totally different angle, but it's very straightforward. Private online makeup lessons, how to apply makeup. Again, it's really compelling.

[00:15:16.720] - Marlene
If I'm wanting to learn how to apply makeup, it's very clear and very specific. And you can see how both of these headlines kind of have a different angle, even though they are about the same thing. So, again, this is something that you can screenshot or write in your workbook. A couple of kind of title templates that you can use that tend to be successful. How to and ways to titles are always compelling.

[00:15:45.950] - Marlene
Including a number is an excellent idea as well. I always recommend including a number when you can, especially an odd number. Those tend to be the most attractive to readers. The ultimate guide to tends to be really strong, but please do not use these unless it's actually an ultimate guide. Don't use an ultimate guide to post if it's going to be 500 words, because that is definitely not an ultimate guide.

[00:16:10.690] - Marlene
How to blank so that blank. These are super fun and you can insert almost anything into this formula. And again, inciting curiosity. So, here's an example I just made up like these five clean hacks are the ultimate time saver. Wait until you see number three.

[00:16:29.870] - Marlene
Okay, what's number three? I want to know what cleaning hacks are. I want to save time. Five cleaning hacks. You see how it's all packed in there.

[00:16:39.010] - Marlene
You should definitely be spending a fair amount of time working on your headlines. And to be honest, a lot of the people I talk to and a lot of my clients let me know if this is you in the chat. They do their headlines as an afterthought, like the last thing they do. You're so tired after writing this huge post that you just want to get it published. And so, you just throw anything up there and I urge you to take a step back from your post, work on it the next day and sit down and brainstorm headlines.

[00:17:09.430] - Marlene
So, what happens after you get the click? Well, you've got to get them to keep reading. One way, of course, is with a great introduction and another is to make sure you have a well structured post. So, I wanted to briefly touch on what structure is and to just be mindful of it when you're writing. When I'm talking about structure, I mean, your outline, your backbone, any piece of writing needs this or your content will fall flat.

[00:17:36.430] - Marlene
We use structure in literally anything we write. Books have structure to them. An email is going to be different than a blog post, and a blog post is going to be different than a landing page or like even an about page on your website, and each blog post has a different structure, too. A tutorial or a recipe post isn't structured the same as, like a roundup or a list style post. So, my point was structure and to pay attention to it is that you've got to make sure that your content is structured in a way that fits the actual content that you're creating and has to have a clear beginning, middle and end.

[00:18:15.370] - Marlene
So, why does this matter? Again, knowing what type of content you're creating and how to structure it for readability and shareability is one of the easiest ways to improve your writing skills. And that's just because blog posts tend to be structured a certain way, so they're more readable, easy to digest, and easy to share with others. So, your action item and your takeaway is one, of course, work on your headlines, prioritize your headlines, and next time you sit down to write, start with an outline. I know that it doesn't sound fun, and a lot of people get on headlines.

[00:18:52.610] - Marlene
No, I hate outlines. But I promise this will make such a difference in your writing, especially if you're just starting out or wanting to improve.

[00:19:01.630] - Marlene
And once it becomes ingrained, you no longer have to do this. But honestly, some of the greatest writers still start with an outline. So, on to secret number three already. The third secret to writing engaging content is to make them binge. You want to create content that's so good, they cannot stop. Here's why?

[00:19:25.070] - Marlene
There's 600 million blogs on the internet right now. So, how are you going to stand out? You've got to create bingeworthy content, content that people cannot get enough of. That means, as we talked about, it's content that's well written, and it's well-structured, content that's thorough and content that captivates others and features a unique voice.

[00:19:52.230] - Marlene
And this is something that I talk a lot about with my clients as well is that it's an excellent way to stand out. Here's why. When you think of brands you love, what is it you fall in love with? A lot of it is probably their voice. It's the branding, it's the visuals, it's the tone, it's the whole package deal. The truth is, people fall for people.

[00:20:16.400] - Marlene
You've got to create content that makes readers fall in love with you and your brand. Personality fueled copy is the number one things that the clients actually request from me, and it's because they know they're going to help. It's going to help them stand out. And it's an online world full of noise. Jeff, who has this luxury camera bag brand, said whoever visits our site gets an immediate impression of what our brand stands for, thanks to the combination of fantastic imagery and playful, energetic copy.

[00:20:48.040] - Marlene
Again, she wanted people to have a certain feeling when they came to their site. And it doesn't matter if you're a content creator or if you're a small business owner, it's something just to keep in mind. It's like, how do you want people to feel when they come to your website? And how can you make them feel that way through your words, through your copy? If you want to grow and engage a loyal audience, you have to create content that people connect to us.

[00:21:13.250] - Marlene
So, here are a couple of ways that we can do that. Your content should contain storytelling techniques were relevant. I'm not saying pour your life story into every blog post. I'm not saying it should be all over your website, but just some storytelling elements are absolutely vital, especially in your blog writing. Your content should infuse some personality whenever it can and sound like a human actually wrote it.

[00:21:40.980] - Marlene
And I know that this last bit can be very difficult for a lot of people. Readers crave a connection, and that means copy that sounds human. Like I said, share part of your story if you want to, if you can sprinkle it in because these are the things that make you more relatable. And I want you to ditch any kind of jargon and industry speak and anything that you're doing to make you sound professional. I actually want you to just erase what you learned in high school English and that habit of going to thesaurus and finding a word that sounded smarter than in another word.

[00:22:18.140] - Marlene
No, it doesn't make you sound smarter. It just makes you sound stuffy. And at the end of the day, that's not what we want. We want to be relatable. You can inspire others and educate while still sounding like yourself.

[00:22:32.010] - Marlene
And you can still be an authority in your space while sounding like yourself. I want to reiterate that last one again because it's very important. A lot of people feel that they have to explain their authority with, like I said, like jargon and stuffy sounding words and stiff copy. And that's not the case. You can still be relatable.

[00:22:52.540] - Marlene
You can still speak in an everyday manner. And when I say speak, I mean, right, what you're writing online. You can still do this in an everyday manner and still be an expert in your field. So, here's what I want you to do and take away from this last exercise. I want you to try embracing a more casual conversational writing style to connect with your audience.

[00:23:18.610] - Marlene
So, just a quick recap, prioritizing our content is at the heart of growing our blogs and businesses, and all the content is made up of good structure, great writing, and click worthy headlines. And in order to engage with our audience, we need to write in a way that speaks to them. Now, I know you showed up today because you want to know how to upload your writing skills and you want to feel confident with the message you're putting out in the world. And you're probably also passionate about what you do and want to create an authentic connection with your audience.

[00:23:52.750] - Marlene
Now, I'm not that special.

[00:23:54.480] - Marlene
I was in the industry for so many years and it still took me a long time to figure it out. And even some of my earlier work that I thought was great when I graduated, it's still kind of cringeworthy at the end of the day. Writing is a craft. It doesn't happen overnight. That being said, I know you don't have 10/15 years to make it happen.

[00:24:14.690] - Marlene
I do know that with the right skill set techniques and training, you can become a confident content creator. That is why I'm so excited to invite you in to the free ecourse how to Find Your Writing Voice. You can find the link below. It's glitz-grammar.com/bbs.

**Transcript:**
[00:00:00.000] - Liz Stapleton, Host
All right, guys. I'm super excited for this next session from Michelle Jackson of Michelle's Money Hungry. I'm always a fan of her site name. Michelle, thank you so much for agreeing to do this.

[00:00:09.290] - Michelle Jackson
Thank you so much, Liz, for having me join you and be a part of the Summit. I'm super excited about talking all things content creation.

[00:00:18.960] - Liz
Yeah, and so, I know some of the reasons I wanted to reach out to you to have this on is because you, I feel like, take content creation to another level. Because, yes, you have a blog, but you also write books. And I feel like you told me you bang out a draft for a book in a week, which is insane. So your present... Yeah, sorry. Go ahead. You were going to say something.

[00:00:39.990] - Michelle
I do things fast, fast and ugly. And we'll get into that in a second.

[00:00:45.890] - Liz
Yes, because your presentation is called Do It Ugly. Can you give us the highlights of what you're going to cover?

[00:00:51.830] - Michelle
So what I've noticed is most content creators, most would be content creators really hesitate on getting things out there because they want things to be perfect. In fact, the more I create content, the more I've decided to allow my stuff to be a little bit ugly to prove the point that you can get things out there, refine them over time and still make money from day number one.

[00:01:17.750] - Liz
Yes, because you. Certainly do that for sure. So, let's go ahead and get started. I'm excited to see what you have to say.

[00:01:25.610] - Michelle
I've got so many words.

[00:01:28.670] - Liz
You what?

[00:01:29.960] - Michelle
I've got so many words, so many things to say. Okay. I'd like to talk about content creation from a different perspective. Normally in a session like this, it's very tempting for the host to try and tell you how to actually make the content, content such as blog post, vlogs, opt-ins, e-books, courses, podcast episodes. But quite frankly, if you're watching this, my hope is that you have at least a basic understanding of how to do that already. Creating content can become really overwhelming. And because of that, many people do the bare minimum, and that's really a mistake. Digital content creators have to create content. It doesn't mean that you have to do it every day, but you have to create pieces of content that can be repurposed and used in more than one place. I would like to have you think of your content in the following way. What purpose does it serve? Are you're you hoping to get people into your business funnel and connect with them over time? Do you want to get people used to making purchases from you so they get in your funnel and you're emailing them and kind of communicating with them, and then one day you let them know about a good or service? Or, are you answering a question that people always ask you all the time? Excuse me, a little hiccup there.

[00:02:54.720] - Michelle
The other thing you should think about when you're thinking about content is, who are you serving with the information that you're putting out in the world? And what change are you trying to help people achieve? Here are some tips and lessons to help you achieve the following results: consistency, engagement, community, and hopefully, income. And, I want you to kind of consider what to expect from the content creation process. So tip number one: create a tagline that helps people enjoying your content, understand what it is you actually do and who you serve. This one small action will create huge results. You just don't want people guessing what it is you do. It just creates clarity. Honestly, I'm going to be totally honest. I really struggled with this because I do more than one thing. I'm multi-passionate like many people who are online. I have more than one area of focus. But, as I worked on this process, I learned that really what I like doing is helping people move forward by taking action and finishing the actual projects that they are working on.

[00:04:10.220] - Michelle
I like to cheer them on and coach them and get them from beginning to end. And so you'll notice in my newer content, if you're familiar with ""Michelle's Money Hungry"", my tagline now is helping online creators make money with what they already know. Now you'll hear this in my podcast episodes in particular, that's really where you'll hear that. You might see that on my blog, on the front page. But if I'm a guest on someone else's website, on someone else's podcast, on their blog, I'm going to more than likely reference that. The reason why that tagline is so important is it's an umbrella for the services that I offer, such as instructing new authors via my Make Money with E-books course. So I make money with ebooks and I teach other people how to do that with a course. So that's content creation, that's instruction of a sort. I have a coaching program. So it's called the ""Brand Building Lab"" and I coach people and work with them to get from beginning to done. Again, that's instructing people in a certain way. And then I also run webinars and podcasts where I kind of do the same thing.

[00:05:24.340] - Michelle
I'm helping move people from one spot to another, like from one point to another. So if you haven't done that, I strongly recommend that you do it, especially because of the time of year that this conference is coming out. It's a perfect time of year to tighten that up so that moving forward, it's easier for you to share what you do to create content based on what your tagline is, and for people to understand who you serve and like who you are. So definitely focus on figuring out what your simple tagline is so that people don't have to guess. You might need to talk to your friends to get some suggestions and input and insight, and they might surprise you in terms of what they think you actually do. So this might be something that you should consider doing, which is talk to your friends and colleagues and people that you've served to see what their perception is of what you do. You might be surprised.

[00:06:27.970] - Michelle
So lesson number one is understanding that each piece of content that you create really begins a process of A/B testing. So you don't just drop a piece of content out there and then it's living out in the world and never return back to it. You're going to spend time observing what happens with that piece of content. Do people opt into it? Do people email you about it? Do people give you comments about it? Do people hate it? Do people unsubscribe? Do they ask additional questions that could be added into that opt-in? So spend some time really observing what happens with the opt-ins or other pieces of content you create, whether it's a blog, podcast, whatever, look into and research the feedback and reactions that you're getting on the content you're creating.

[00:07:24.350] - Michelle
Lesson number two: make it super easy for people to get to your content. If you're going on a podcast interview, use a pretty link that is super easy for people to remember and get to your content. So if you run a website that you don't own, so basically you'll host it like on blogger or that thing, it might be hard for people to remember that your website is prettyturtle.blogpost.com. That's a lot to remember. So when you're on interviews or you're a guest on other people's websites or on their blog, really think about how to simplify the URLs that you're sharing with other people that direct them to the stuff that you do and the content that you're creating.

[00:08:18.150] - Michelle
You want it easy. One of the things that no one tells you is that something as simple as your blog post URL can make or break the searches leading to your website. So before I would have posts that would be like MichellesMoneyHungry.com, because MichellesMoneyHungry is my website. So MichellesMoneyHungry.com/things-that-I-like-to-think-about blah, blah, blah. That is a crazy long URL. It's very difficult to remember. The Google... It's not Google searchable. It's just too much. So now if you were to see the URLs that I share, it would be something like this: MichellesMoneyHungry.com/timetolaunch. That is actually a post that I did. And that URL is SEO specific to the topic that I shared in that post. So make things easy for people in terms of directing them to your content. Also, you can use text-to-opt-in, which is a service that gets people... They're on their phones usually when they're looking at your information or engaging with your content. So text-to-opt-in as a service may be a great way to direct them to the content you're creating. Leadpages still has that in beta. I actually used text to opt in on Leadpages quite a bit last year, but it was a little glitchy. So I'm waiting for them to refine that and make that better so that I can start sharing it again. I should also say that I had a really difficult time keeping things simple with this because I have a lot of things that I want people to do. I want them to get on my email list. I want them to take my course. I want them to read my romance books or my non-fiction books. I want them to engage in my coaching. So there's all these things that I do. But honestly, those are too many things for people to figure out and focus on. So instead, I had to simplify things because honestly, three links to an opt-in, a post, a blog or a blog, that's too much. There are too many actions that people have to take. Give them just one.

[00:10:46.280] - Michelle
So tip number two is now, or rather tip number two is direct people to do one thing, just to take one action. That's it. Now I make sure to direct people using my content to take one clear action. For me, currently that action is getting on my email list. So for 2020, the only thing I want people to do is get on my email list. That's it. That's all I want them to do. So if I'm a guest on a podcast, I only share an opt-in that is made for that audience, and the goal is to get people on my email list. If I am writing a blog post on my own site, the goal is to get them on my email list. If I am on Twitter or Instagram and I'm sharing some information, the goal is to get them on my email list. Once they're on my email list, I can share the other things. So it takes some of the pressure off and it makes it easier for me because I only need them to do one thing, even though I don't like this, one thing.

[00:11:53.000] - Michelle
Lesson number three, and this is the final lesson, your content needs to do what it promised to do. It doesn't need to be pretty. Please stop using the excuse that you need better camera quality for your blogs, the perfect audio set up for your podcast, or a pretty, pretty free or paid course. Just get stuff done, improve your content with the feedback that you receive and keep it moving. So once you launch your products, your goods, your services, your courses, your blog post, whatever it is you're doing, get it out in the world because it takes time to refine it.

[00:12:32.930] - Michelle
My blog post from 2012 versus the post now are completely different. They were crappy in 2012. Why? Because I was new to blogging. I was new to crafting content. I was new to SEO. I was new to everything. I was just excited to get my story out there. But again, if you're watching this, you're probably thinking, I'd like to help people. I'd like to help myself. I'd like to make money. I'd like to get people to do certain things. So I'm going to tell you your first iteration of whatever it is you're going to do is not going to be as good as the 100th iteration of whatever it is that you do. It's just how it is. That's why there's this thing called practice. Get stuff done and get it out there.

[00:13:24.310] - Michelle
So tip number three is do it ugly. Your ugly is probably probably not as ugly as you think it is. I used to hate doing live streams because I felt awkward and weird. And I know that sometimes I stutter or stumble on my words. But over time, as I did it over and over again, it's gotten better. And people really enjoy them. And I've learned how to interact with people, what to talk about, what to consider in terms of content. It's the same thing with whatever you're doing with whatever content you're creating. You're probably doing a much better job with the content that you're creating than you ever would expect, but you can't improve it unless you get it out there. Done is better than pretty. Just is. Done is better than perfect. It's just done is always better.

[00:14:20.280] - Michelle
I'd like to dive a little deeper into the whole idea of A/B testing your content. Here's the thing. Sometimes you'll create something that seems to fall flat with your audience, but that might not be the case. Here are a couple of things that you can do before kicking that resource or content to the curb. So the first thing is conduct a survey to see if what you've put out there actually addresses an issue or concern that your community is actually struggling with or cares about. You can use Survey Monkey to do this, or you can ask questions via Instagram and get answers in real time: Twitter, Facebook, or whatever platform your people are hanging out with and interact with you the most. Obviously, if you have an email list, which I really hope you do, you will communicate with the people on your list and survey them as well. So quite frankly, I would do all of them. So in my case for Michelle is Money Hungry, I have an email list. I have podcast listeners. I have people on different social media platforms, and those are the places where I need to be addressing any questions, issues or whatever. I just need to talk to those people.

[00:15:41.880] - Michelle
So, what does it look like to survey your community? Super easy. Make it really easy. Literally ask one question and be direct. Hey, I just dropped such and such resource. How did you like it? What could make it better? Or it could be, what do you need? What are you dealing with? What are you struggling with? So let your audience lead the conversation and the direction that you're going with the content that you create. Several years ago, not several, like a year and a half to two years ago, I would create for many, many years. That sounds so confusing. Anyway, from 2012 until 2018, at least, I would create a lot of random freaking content. I was definitely talking about personal finance, but then I veer off like I did in this video because I'm human. I would veer off and talk about the weather. I would veer off and talk about emotions, not necessarily related to money. I would veer off and talk about something else. And that is something that can happen a lot when you're creating content. It has to be very intentional and focused. And for that to happen, you just have to play around over time to get a feeling of your voice within your blog or audio content, video content, who you're serving, what their needs are, what they want from you. So the content that I make now versus before is very different. And the leading question that I ask myself is this, what's in it for them? So I try not to write content where the question is framed as what's in it for me. I try to write content from the consumer's perspective, like, how am I helping them do a thing? How am I entertaining them? How am I educating them? How am I moving them from point A to point Z? So, when I create my content now, I'm very intentional about making sure that it moves the needle for the people who are enjoying it. Or else why bother?

[00:18:12.050] - Michelle
Is your content easy to connect with and consume? So, are you sharing your content in ways that's confusing to your community? An example of this would be a URL with a lot of digits, and numbers, and dashes. So if I were to share a PDF where to get to that PDF, it's michellesmanyhungry.com/1-2-mjk-4, that is so complicated and confusing, no one's going to remember that. No one's going to remember that. You have to make it so easy. So something like michellesmoneyhungry.com/helpful-pdf.

[00:18:58.780] - Michelle
And when you're sharing links and ways to get to your content, also keep in mind search engine optimization. So I used to have all these URLs that made no sense. And so they would be very confusing to Google and to whatever search engines are out there. So now I make sure that my URLs actually make sense for two reasons. One, I want to share them and make it easy for people to find the stuff that I'm sharing. And two, I want to make sure that search engines completely understand what the content is that I'm actually sharing. Also, if you are sharing text-to-opt-in, test that out.

[00:19:47.440] - Michelle
I actually found out that there were problems with my lead pages, text-to-opt-in, after a huge podcast interview where I was the guest. I had a resource that I shared and people were opting in. And then other people were like, we can't opt-in, we're having problems. So what I realized was that text to opt in was still in beta. And so I think it's still glitchy. But if I tested it out for a couple of different opt-ins, I think I probably would have noticed that and would have opted to do something else to share the PDF before going on that very large podcast. Are the tools that you're using mobile-friendly? So are the tools that you're using to share your content with mobile-friendly? If you go on the LightRail here in Denver or anywhere else in the US, you will see 60 people with their heads down looking at their phone, scrolling through it. You'll see 15 other people, I call them psychopaths, 15 other people on their iPads. And then the psychopaths will be the five people reading books. I would be one of those people. Most people are consuming a large amount of digital content via their cell phones.

[00:21:11.870] - Michelle
So go onto your phone and look at how your content looks, how easy it is to consume, how easy it is to listen to podcast episodes that you're sharing, how easy it is to watch a vlog if you are running a YouTube channel, how easy it is to download things, how easy it is to opt in and sign up for stuff, test it out. You don't have to do it for every item that you're putting out there, but it might be a best practice that you should start. Now, the other issue could be when you're sharing your content. One of the things I now do is I share my content later in the day. The reason why I do this is I started to notice across the board for every project that I have. And I actually have three, I have my romance novels that I write. I have Michelle's Money Hungry and all the things that are umbrella-ed under that. And then I have Square State, which is all about Colorado and all the things that are that. So I have a couple of different email lists that I manage. And I just noticed over time for those specific lists that people were a lot more responsive during the evenings, later in the day, later in the afternoon, partly because I have people who are on the list who don't live in my state.

[00:22:36.140] - Michelle
So, you might want to see via Google Analytics or doing a survey as well, Hey, where are you guys living? Where are you from? To give you a better idea of some of the unspoken trends or issues related to where your people really physically are. So most of the people who contact or who connect with my Square State information, they're Americans. Like hands down, they're almost all from the US. At this point in time. But maybe in May that will change to British tourists because maybe they're searching for content and information to prepare them for a trip to Colorado. Likewise, my Michelle is Money Hungry, content has very specific people looking at it. So what I've noticed is when I share that content on Pinterest, weirdly enough, I have a huge number of people in New York consuming it, a huge number of people in L.A. consuming it. And then everything else is like a lot less, like other places are a lot less in terms of people consuming that content.

[00:23:57.470] - Michelle
So, look at your analytics, spend some time in the back end of your website, your shows, your podcast, your blogs, and check it out. You don't have to do it daily. In fact, I would say that's a little excessive, but you could do it once every two weeks just to give you an idea of where people are so that you know that you're releasing things at the time that they're available to consume them. And also I look at when I look at people's stuff. So one of the habits that I've gotten into is researching how I look for things. So I figure that I'm my own ideal client avatar. So I'm my own ideal client avatar, excuse me. So I looked at my own habits in terms of how I searched for things, how I looked for solutions, how I looked for information. And that was a very interesting snapshot into what I do. So you may want to do the same. Look at what your last Google searches were. Look at how you found Facebook groups to inspire and educate you. Look at how you found podcast episodes to educate yourself and entertain yourself. What blogs do you like to subscribe to or watch? So spend some time observing your own habits so that you can project those out in terms of what your own avatars are doing.

[00:25:47.880] - Michelle
Actually, the last thing I would say is, as you're sharing information out there, don't be shy about how often you're sharing it. At the time I'm recording this, it's the beginning of 2020. How many election commercials have you seen today? My point exactly. You've seen them all day long. All day long. You've seen them at the Super Bowl while you're watching the Super Bowl. So people are very much motivated to share as often as possible their stuff, their content, their books, their content that they're creating for you to enjoy. Okay? So don't be shy about doing, about sharing your information more than you think you should. Share it. Because if you don't, we don't know what you have out there in the world. We just don't. We're busy. I am busy. I have a lot going on. And so more often than not, I miss the stuff that you share just like everybody else. So if I were to look in my emails, especially if you're thinking about email marketing, there are so many emails I never, ever, ever open because I can't keep up with them. And then I'll go back and open them because I don't unsubscribe from the list. I just don't have the time to connect with all that information. So that's probably the case for the people that follow you. They may be busy. And then one day they'll go back into your content or whatever it is, whatever it is that you're sharing and check it out. So don't be shy about sharing your stuff because we don't know what you're doing if you don't share it with us.

[00:27:36.140] - Michelle
And then finally, try to create content that converts. And what what I mean by that is I alluded to the fact that before I would write all these random posts and they were good and interesting, but they weren't going to grow my page views the way I wanted them to. They weren't going to connect with the people I was trying to really help. And, there's a reason why those how-to posts are so popular. Are you answering questions that people are looking for solutions to? Are you, again, looking into Google to see, to gain insight into how you look for helpful content. That is something to think about. Make sure as you create content that you're doing a thing. That thing is helping people. How you help them is based on the title, the SEO, the solution that you provide. Again, how to post is a great way to start. You can check out more information just by Googling people's content to see what they're sharing.

[00:28:51.230] - Michelle
Finally, if you're stumped on what to create, here are some of my favorite types of content in no particular order. Podcast interviews as the guest. Those are so awesome, and I'll tell you why, because you don't have to edit the show. You don't have to manage anything with it. All you have to do is share the content. Insta-stories. Those are great, too, because you can just pop on 10 minutes from now. You could just pop on and talk to people and share a resource and there you go. And you can ask them to slide into your DMs to get a link to it. Free mini courses via Thinkific or Teachable. I currently use Thinkific as my course platform, but both do the same thing. They're both great. Create a free mini course that helps people out. I love them. Powerpoints. I actually use Google Slides or Canva actually has great templates for PowerPoints. And so you're able to really highlight and share cool pieces of information, solutions, that kind of thing for the people you're trying to help, downloadable PDFs, and of course, podcasts as the host that actually owns the show. Vlogs, I don't really create vlogs, so that's why I like Insta-stories, so that's where my video content is being generated. So hopefully this was helpful to you. There's so many ways to create content, so many reasons why you should be doing it. Honestly, I want to challenge you to create one new opt-in or resource or product, not even product, just like something cool to help your community every month for the next 12 months, 12 things. You'll far exceed that. But for some of you, it may feel like a big ask. It's not. You've got this. I can't wait to check out the stuff that you're sharing. And thank you so much for watching.

[00:30:59.920] - Liz
Michelle, thank you so much. That was so helpful. I am excited to do things a little more ugly, for sure.

[00:31:09.720] - Michelle
I hope that people have been inspired to take action and just get things out there in the world. It takes a little while for you to get the feedback that you need in order to refine, improve and really perfect, what you're doing. So please, everyone who's watched this, get your stuff out there. Do it ugly. Make sure you grab the opt-in as well, which is at MichellesMoneyHungry.com/do-it-ugly

[00:31:38.440] - Liz
And the link is below. Why don't you tell them what that is a little bit?

[00:31:42.670] - Michelle
Basically, it's a mini course that goes through whether or not you want to start a blog, a podcast, write your first book or create your first course, and just the bare bones actions that you need to take in order to get it out there.

[00:31:58.840] - Liz
Yeah. So definitely go grab that, guys. Michelle just creates amazing things. I know she calls them ugly, but they're not. She's always making... I'm like, what have you done lately? Because there's always something new. Definitely go grab that for sure. And Michelle, thank you so much for this session. I think it's been a fantastic day to learn a lot.

[00:32:19.070] - Michelle
Thank you so much for having me and much success with the Summit.

**Transcript:**
[00:00:00.000] - Liz Stapleton, Host
All right, guys. We're here with Nikki from Post by Ghost, which is a super cute name, by the way. Nikki, welcome and thank you so much.

[00:00:07.560] - Nikki, Posts by Ghost
Thank you.

[00:00:08.460] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Yeah. So we're going to be diving into SEO because it's such an expansive... We have multiple sessions on it, but there's so much to learn and to know that. And I'm really excited for your session because we're going to talk about Google Search Console, which I don't know much about. But can you tell us a little bit about your background as well as what we're going to cover today?

[00:00:29.440] - Nikki, Posts by Ghost
Yeah. So basically I started out probably, I don't know, 15 or more years ago doing freelance writing, and then I grew into doing writing for businesses and bloggers and stuff like that. And so then I naturally progressed into SEO because I really wanted to show businesses and bloggers how they can get better found online. I've been working in SEO for, oh, Jeez, I don't even know, six, eight years probably. We mainly work with... We work with a lot of bloggers, but we also work with a lot of businesses. I speak at conferences on this stuff, and I really like talking about it, and I can talk about it forever. Luckily, there's a time limit on this. That should be helpful.

[00:01:14.420] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Yeah. We're going to talk about really the practical, tactical aspects, and we're going to talk about how to just use your old content to help you get further with SEO, and what to do when you're creating new content and digging into Search Console to help you, right?

[00:01:30.660] - Nikki, Posts by Ghost
Yeah, absolutely. I just want to talk about some really practical tips, especially for bloggers. There's some tools that you can use that a lot of bloggers don't even know about or just don't really leverage very well. I'm hoping to give you some really nice, practical things you can do right now to take away and go work on and add to your blog.

[00:01:50.220] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Yes. I'm excited for this because I'm always looking to expand my knowledge on SEO. Let's go ahead and dive in. I'm going to lead the way, and I'll pop in with questions and stuff.

[00:02:03.160] - Nikki, Posts by Ghost
Okay, perfect. Yeah. I think the big thing that I want to talk about first is just answering searcher intent. I think people think about keywords in the sense that they think, Oh, I need to do this keyword research. I need to find this perfect keyword, and then it's going to have this magical set of numbers assigned to it. A lot of people are searching for it, and I know I can rank for it. I'm going to cram it in to my content in a way that maybe isn't working. Now, it doesn't mean that you don't want keywords that you know people are searching for a lot, and you know your market is searching for a lot, know your readers, right? But I guess what I'm saying is, when it comes to search or intent, you need to sit down and think about, Okay, how are my readers searching for this? And how can I answer their question with a post? I like to think about keywords. When you think about a focus keyword, I like to think about that as the topic of your post. Okay, so what am I writing about? That's your keyword.

[00:03:07.160] - Nikki, Posts by Ghost
People think it's this magical thing that they're going to come up with this perfect thing and just stick it in a bunch of places and that's just going to magically make them rank. But it's more than that. It's really about figuring out, again, what your readers want and then answering their questions. A lot of the time I go, when you get emails from people, and I say this to businesses too, it's like when you're out in the field doing customer service, but same goes for bloggers, right? When you get emails from people, when you have people responding your mailing list, you have people commenting on stuff, what are they asking about? What do they want to know from you? That's the stuff that you want to write about. And that's going to lend itself naturally to what keywords are going to be important to your blog. I just want to say a little bit about that because I just feel like there's a lot of shoehorning that goes on. It's just like I need to.

[00:03:57.700] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Try to get the keyword in this many times, and some of that's... Like, Yoast says you need it in there more or something because you're using a plugin, but you can use related keywords, and that can almost be better. It's called LSI, which I forget what it stands for. But am I totally off base here? Am I using the right terminology?

[00:04:17.190] - Nikki, Posts by Ghost
No, that's fine. I mean, LSI is fine. I don't like using LSI just because the term just because it's confusing.

[00:04:23.610] - Liz Stapleton, Host
But I mean- words and phrases that relate to the topic you're talking on. Exactly.

[00:04:28.630] - Nikki, Posts by Ghost
Exactly, yeah. So I mean, related keywords that support the keyword that you're writing about. So if it's how to make macaroni and cheese, you're obviously going to have various things that naturally fit into that, right? So it's going to be the type of noodle and the type of cheese and the different things. And it's not something that's way out here that's different than you have to also find. It's those natural words that also flow right into what you're already talking about. And I think what I tell people the most is like, get rid of those garbage words I say. The garbage words are when you're saying like it, or that, or whatever, use nouns, adjectives and verb, really specific stuff, and that's what's filling in your content more and making it much more robust. You're not just saying, Then you stir it. Well, what are you stirring? That's a really great way to just naturally add a lot of those, we call them semantic keywords most of the time, those related keywords in a natural way without trying to make some magic happen that is impractical.

[00:05:33.560] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Yeah. It's understanding how to use the keywords throughout your content to make it the most bang for your buck, if you will, without being obnoxious.

[00:05:45.540] - Nikki, Posts by Ghost
Yeah. I want to say a little bit, too, about a lot of bloggers are in WordPress, and I really like WordPress SEO. We do specialize in WordPress SEO, but that doesn't mean that you can't do SEO on other platforms. It's a lot more difficult to do SEO on other platforms. I just want to throw that out there. If you've been on Squarespace for a while or something and maybe you don't get a lot of traffic and you're thinking about making the move, Squarespace in particular, I've had a lot of problems with with SEO. The way that the site is structured, like a lot of their templates don't have the proper markup in place, and you just can't get as far as you can with WordPress, for example. If you are using WordPress, I do recommend using an SEO plugin. Yoast is usually pretty much the most common. I like Yoast. I think what I want to say about that, though, is that a lot of people think like, Oh, I just put in a word in that focus keyword field, and then I get that green light, and then I go on my day and I post this optimize.

[00:06:50.910] - Nikki, Posts by Ghost
But what I encourage people to do is the little indicators that Yoast has, it'll have the green, what you did right, what you did okay, and then what you didn't do right. Those are an okay set of guidelines. They're not terrible. I don't think they're all perfect or great. But the thing is that it's not a bad set of guidelines in terms of where to put things and how to optimize your posts. What I encourage people to do is try to get that green light on as many of those items as possible, if it naturally makes sense. If it's something where you just feel like you're like, Okay, I'm really going overboard on this. Then in that case, it's like, Okay, then dial it back. There's also some things about Yoast where... I know they updated it recently, but you only have to have something like 300 or 500 words in the post for them to say, Yeah, your post is long enough. Most top content that ranks right now is 1,800, 2,200 words. If you have that many words to say about something, then I say cover the topic as extensively as possible. Go into detail about that one specific topic, get specific, talk about one thing, elaborate on it, but don't just add words to add words, right?

[00:08:12.630] - Nikki, Posts by Ghost
We don't want to just like, Oh, this doesn't have enough words. I'm just going to cram more words in there so that there's more words. That's my went off on a thing here. I know, but.

[00:08:25.090] - Liz Stapleton, Host
I think it's important because people will so stress if they don't get the light green, right? I can't get a green and just move on. If your post is solid, you feel like you've covered it extensively. It's a machine.

[00:08:41.990] - Nikki, Posts by Ghost
Right. Exactly. That's a reason that I don't like the readability. There's a readability tab in Yoast now, and that just really sucks because it's like-.

[00:08:52.250] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Maybe your audience are people with advanced degrees and so you want it to be more complicated or something.

[00:08:58.660] - Nikki, Posts by Ghost
Exactly. That's the thing. Exactly. It's saying, Oh, you need it to be this reading level, and you need it to include these kinds of words, and be this way, and whatever. That is the opposite of what marketing is. When you run a blog, you're doing marketing, right? Because you are reaching a specific audience with your stuff. You know them better than Yoast is going to. It's like you said, yeah, it's a machine, right? It's like, no, it has no idea what it's doing. I think one more thing too, is that focused keyword field in Yoast, some people will just put a word in there and think that's doing something in itself, but just putting a word in there doesn't.

[00:09:41.050] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Do anything. It doesn't tell Google, Oh, this is my keyword. Exactly. It's a tool to help you see how well you've optimized your post in terms of on-site SEO or on-page SEO for that particular keyword.

[00:09:53.450] - Nikki, Posts by Ghost
Right. Exactly. Yep, exactly. Take it as a set of guidelines, not the be all and all, but it's a helpful tool. There's other ones out there too if Yoast isn't working well. I do like Rank Math is a good one that I've gotten more into lately. All-in-one SEO is okay. I don't like that one as much. You don't have as much control over certain things as you do in Yoast. So and Rank Math. So that's what I would recommend for that. But definitely I say use an SEO plugin. It's helpful. It's nice to have that just an extra practical tool in your toolbox to help you optimize your content.

[00:10:29.220] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Okay. Yeah, I like that. So let's talk about, especially to people who've been blogging for a while and they didn't know what they were doing, how can they make their site more SEO-friendly, their old content, and really start getting it ranking if they've only been getting traffic from Pinterest or something?

[00:10:45.720] - Nikki, Posts by Ghost
Right. Yeah. That's a big thing I hear is a lot of bloggers have all their eggs in their Pinterest basket. The thing is, if you've been blogging a long time, or even not that long, but let's say you're just not getting a lot of search traffic, if you get to the point where you have a lot of content, what we've been finding to be really successful lately is taking that old content and saying, Okay, what is working? Let's put that in a bucket and say, This stuff is doing well. I know I'm ranking well for this stuff. I'm getting traffic in for this stuff. I know my audience likes this stuff. They like it on social and search. I'm seeing traffic. It's cool. We got that bucket of stuff that works. But then let's take a look at this other bucket. The other bucket is stuff that's not working. Now, if you have a ton of content, you might need somebody to help you get this parsed out because sometimes it can be a little bit hard to analyze. But SEO is a long game, and I do want to just point that out. Even Google themselves says that any concentrated SEO effort can take, I think they say, nine to twelve months, and that's coming from Google.

[00:11:58.060] - Nikki, Posts by Ghost
What I'm saying is any progress you're making is good. If it takes you a really long time to do all this, that's fine. It's just moving in the right direction is what's important. A lot of bloggers, what I hear is you've been blogging, especially if people have been blogging a long time, they come and they say, Okay, I have stuff that was from the very beginning of when I started blogging and it's embarrassing and I don't want it out there at all and I hate it. I'm like, Well, it doesn't have to be out there. A lot of the time in that, we call it low performing content, OPC, basically in that bucket is usually going to be that stuff, but also some things where you're like, Okay, I'm looking at this. I don't think I'm getting anything out of this, but the meat of it's here, but it's just not good. It could be good, but it's just not very good. There's a couple of different options for what to do with that content. First of all, when it comes to the really bottom of the barrel stuff. I'm talking about stuff that usually we put it in the bucket in the very bottom of the bucket if it is content that has gotten 10 or less hits over the last year.

[00:13:11.040] - Nikki, Posts by Ghost
In itself, if you add up all things that maybe are under 10 sessions or users or however, I mean, we usually put 10 as a benchmark in general because 10 is like, okay, that means no one's coming to it. Whatever benchmark you're using, that's fine. But if you add all that content up, you may realize that, oh, if I add this up, I am getting a lot with everything, but it's all just not getting any individual piece of this is just not getting anything in the door. Excuse me. Basically, that stuff, what we want to do is say, okay, there's pieces of content on here that are getting nothing. For those, I usually don't say delete it only because of the leader's remorse. Sometimes you're like, Oh, I wrote something about that, and now it's gone.

[00:14:01.120] - Liz Stapleton, Host
I'm.

[00:14:01.520] - Nikki, Posts by Ghost
Just that. Yeah, exactly. I think everybody's done it where they're like, Oh, crap, what happened to that thing? You'll have it in your trash bucket in WordPress if you're on WordPress, and that's fine. But I still usually just recommend a couple other things instead of just flat out deleting it just for everyone's sake. Basically, if there is a post that, let's say you want to have it on the blog because let's say it's something that is personal to you, and maybe on social media, people like to see it or something, or you just want to still have it on your blog, but it's just not really conducive to search. Maybe it's just a personal story that in some way, it's just not something that... You know people aren't going to land on it for whatever reason, and that doesn't matter to you, but you still want to keep it on your blog. What you can do with that is it's called no indexing. Basically, what that is, is you're just telling Google like, Hey, I know this post is on my site, but I just want you to ignore it. To do that, usually, and this is another reason I have a good SEO plugin, All in One doesn't have a lot of...

[00:15:13.250] - Nikki, Posts by Ghost
From my experience, I just haven't seen a lot of control with no index, and that's one of the reasons I don't like it. But Yoast and Rank Math have a.

[00:15:19.600] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Function where- It makes it super easy. Yeah. I don't know about it, but I believe it.

[00:15:24.870] - Nikki, Posts by Ghost
Yeah. You literally go into the post, there's a little advanced toggle, and it says, Do you want this to be shown in search? And you say, No, and then it's off search. Then once Google goes through and reads, and the next time it looks at your site, it's going to go, Oh, that's no index. Now I'm just not going to put that... Not keep putting that back up. Now, if it's really bad and embarrassing or whatever, and you're just like, This is terrible and I don't want it. Again, I don't recommend deleting it. I usually say, But let's redirect people to something better, right? That's where 301 redirect comes into play. That says to Google, What we're trying to do... Okay, it's telling Google like, Hey, this is somewhere else, which it doesn't have to be a like for like necessarily. What I always say with a redirect is redirect it to something relevant. So if it was a recipe, try to do something like a similar-.

[00:16:26.120] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Don't redirect it to something completely different because that's going to give some bad signals to Google. It's not a change. It's better that it goes to 404 and Google eventually is like, Okay, that's just not there anymore. Then to have it go to something completely different and this person, no, they're sending the wrong stuff.

[00:16:45.830] - Nikki, Posts by Ghost
Yeah. That's the thing is like, if all else fails, you can redirect it to your homepage. There's a few plugins out there that'll just redirect all your 404s to homepage, but I don't recommend doing that at all. Mainly the thing about it is broken links themselves aren't necessarily a direct ranking factor, but here's my take on this. It's that both to Google and your users, if you have a bunch of broken links on your site, it decreases your usability. Nobody likes it. If I'm on a website and I click something and it's broken, I'm like, oh. The odds are I'm just going to X out of that and go find something somewhere else. I'm not going to go try to find it on the same site I was trying to find it on, right? Yes. What you want to do is send people to something that is relevant that keeps them on your site because then you're keeping your traffic going and everything. Then another important point, though, about that is it's always good to also know index that post that you redirected. That's a step that I think a lot of people missed. The idea is you're just covering your bases and just saying like, Hey, this is gone.

[00:17:51.820] - Nikki, Posts by Ghost
You're telling Google it's gone, but then you're also just making sure that everybody goes somewhere else, and then you're just covering all your bases. I think that's really important. Then you also have your stuff that you're like, Okay. I wrote this when I just started out, and I didn't really know what I was doing, but I did this really cool DIY bench that I built, and it was a cool project. The photos are pretty decent, but the way I wrote it is just like, Oh. What you can do is go back and improve that content. That's the thing is, bloggers a lot of the time, are just focused on like, I got to get all this new stuff out. I got to post three times a week, and I got to come up with all these ideas. Really, I mean, quantity is fine if you're creating really great stuff, but that's the thing is quality is just paramount of anything, right? The thing is, if you produce less content, but it's much better. Yes. Yes, that is so much better. The other thing is, instead of just plowing forward and everything, you've got this reservoir of stuff that's just sitting there, right?

[00:19:07.500] - Nikki, Posts by Ghost
Why not get this stuff cleaned up, optimize it, round it out, write more content, get those adjectives, nouns, and verbs in there. Get it really robust and looking really good and everything. If the pictures aren't good, go ahead and change them out, of course, and whatever. And adding getting your image alt tags, which I could talk about that too, but getting your H2s, your headers in there really nice, getting those different little pieces that Yoast has green with getting all that put together, but also just making the content better, right? The thing is, if you go ahead and do that, we've seen really nice results when you republish that with a new date. You don't need to like, Hey, guys, this is a new post. You don't need to pretend it's a new thing, but republishing it with a new date is another signal that just tells.

[00:20:07.430] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Yeah, I actually just did that. I went and I updated a review because I was on page two of Google, and I was like, All right, let me see what I can do. And I went in, I adjusted some things, and I added some updates to my results because it was a review, right? And I just republished it. And so we'll see if I see a little more increase.

[00:20:30.670] - Nikki, Posts by Ghost
Yeah, absolutely. And that's exactly the idea. And the thing is, too, is don't get discouraged if every single thing you update doesn't immediately or even long term perform as well as you'd hope. The idea, though, is that you're making improvements, right? You made that better. That is going to make your traffic better. It might take a while, but it's going to be the better choice for you long term than to just have this thing that's just not as good, sitting, hanging out there, just being crap. I was going to say something else with that too.

[00:21:05.730] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Sorry.

[00:21:06.670] - Nikki, Posts by Ghost
Oh, no, it's fine. I can't remember, but that's okay. But yeah, republished with the new date and making that full progress over time. A lot of times, exactly like you just said, where we see the most opportunity is, I know I'm on page two for a really nice keyword. What can I do? It's a relevant keyword. It totally makes sense. That's exactly what this post is about. I'm on the page two. If I made this better, especially if I look at the stuff on page one, it's like, okay, I can do better than that. Then republish it, make it better. Now here's the thing too, is that Google isn't very smart. Google is getting smarter. Google can hear me say this. But basically, the thing is people think Google is really smart. But a lot of people have been nailed with a few of the most recent updates. The November eighth one was really huge. Then this last core update in January, it both knocked a lot of bloggers. It can be bad. The thing is a lot of people are going, Oh, I thought I was doing everything right. Sometimes there's these growing pains.

[00:22:14.570] - Nikki, Posts by Ghost
Google goes through an update and it takes a while for things to even out, and it's this growing pains thing. It's really important to not get discouraged if you're like, Okay, I just got nailed by this. Yeah, it can be a catastrophe. Do not get wrong. I'm not minimizing that because it can be. But if you know that you're moving in the right direction, long term, you're still going to see year over year, really nice growth. What's important is to not get discouraged and to keep moving forward and work through those growing pains with Google. But also, if you do get nailed, take a really serious evaluation of like, Okay, what does my site look like overall? I like to use the book analogy, right? If you go and... You're going to publish a book, right? Like a physical book. And if there's a bunch of pages that are low quality, they're not in order, they don't make sense, they're not speaking to your audience, you're not just going to be like, Yeah, go to print. You're going to go back and you're going to rewrite that, you're going to take out the stuff that doesn't make sense.

[00:23:17.430] - Nikki, Posts by Ghost
You're going to rearrange things and get it all really great. And that's the thing is take a really honest look at the state of your blog as a whole. And if you're relying on just a few pieces of content to get people in the door, that lower quality content can be dragging down the overall quality of your site. And so we want to think about this as like, Okay, what am I doing here? What can I be doing? And to continue to see some nice growth and search. So yeah, that's my take on that.

[00:23:51.970] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Yeah. And I do just want to note, when you're republishing, don't schedule it for the future because it is going to screw you up. So you need to schedule it for a time of 30 pass. Do it from 10 minutes pass or whatever if you need to. But don't go in a publish post and to republish it, do a future date. Don't schedule it because that'll screw stuff up.

[00:24:13.410] - Nikki, Posts by Ghost
Yes, that's a really excellent point. Yeah, because that'll essentially take your post off of Google. Basically, when you draft your post, which is what you're doing when you do that, you're effectively no indexing it. You're taking your post off the radar and Google is like, There was something here. The thing is, is like, I think it's really important to note that if your top content starts to sink.

[00:24:36.230] - Nikki, Posts by Ghost
Then.

[00:24:37.400] - Nikki, Posts by Ghost
There's reason to go ahead and improve it. But I like to go with, if it ain't broke, don't fix it. If you have content that is ranking in a really high position for a nice keyword and you're bringing in a lot of traffic until that starts to drop, it might not be your best post. But you know what? If you change it, and this is where Google gets really finicky. I mean, there's no guarantee that you change it, and then Google is like, Oh, yeah, I love this now. They might be like, Oh, I don't like this anymore. Even if you added something relevant or better. I know that's frustrating, a little bit counterint, but when you're relying on income and everything from your performing stuff, it's like, don't mess with it. But if you're starting to see a general decline from all your traffic and if your top stuff starts to dip, then yeah, go for it. That is the time to go ahead and make that move because that's what we've done with certain sites who come in and they've just said, year over year, I just keep going down. It's like, okay, you know what?

[00:25:37.780] - Nikki, Posts by Ghost
Now it's time to let's evaluate your top 10 posts. Especially for bloggers who've been blogging a really long time. You may have been the king or the queen of that topic six years ago, and now it's like everybody else is doing it too. It's like, oh, crap. It's really important to recognize all of those things. Yeah, for sure. Okay.

[00:26:02.100] - Liz Stapleton, Host
All right. So let's go ahead and see if we can talk a little bit about Google Search Console, which everyone I feel like is aware of Google Analytics.

[00:26:11.240] - Liz Stapleton, Host
But.

[00:26:11.990] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Fewer people are aware of Google Search Console and the data it can provide you in terms of figuring out what to write and what's doing well. So would you mind diving into that, please?

[00:26:24.490] - Nikki, Posts by Ghost
Yeah, absolutely. So just quickly before I share my screen here, I do want to just say that what's really cool about Google Search Console is it really gives you the opportunity to proactively monitor what's going on with your search traffic. That's just something that you can set up different goals and different things in Google Analytics, and that is a very handy tool. But Google Search Console is really what's going to give you that forefront of information to be like, Okay, how am I doing? What can I do better? Let me just share my screen, see if this works.

[00:26:59.800] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Yes.

[00:27:00.070] - Nikki, Posts by Ghost
Okay, awesome. Essentially, when you go to, and this is just a tester blog that we've been running out here, do not pay attention to anything specific with this in terms of what's on here, but this is one of our tester ones. But anyway, basically you have a few reports here. You have your performance report and your coverage report. Now, one thing that I want to point out first and foremost is that if you have a security problem or a manual action on your account, both of those, especially the manual action, indicates that Google is very upset with something about how you've structured your content. With bloggers, a lot of the time, the most common thing that we see is unnatural linking structure, which can be caused by if you did old link parties and stuff like that back in the day and trading a lot of links. What happens then is maybe you've moved on and your blog is of higher quality, but you've interchanged links with people who haven't kept up their content and stuff like that. Then you've got all these links that look like they were in trade. What also happens with that is if you don't have no follows on links that- Are paid?

[00:28:14.260] - Nikki, Posts by Ghost
Yeah, are paid, right. That can look like you're trying to be a shyster, so we want to not do that.

[00:28:20.040] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Keep everything above board.

[00:28:21.990] - Nikki, Posts by Ghost
Exactly.

[00:28:22.630] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Make sure you attend sessions is on the legal side of blogging.

[00:28:26.110] - Nikki, Posts by Ghost
Yes, seriously. Listen to them. I do not take legal advice from me. If you do have one of those things, you're going to get a big red box at the very top when you come to your main overview page, and that's something to pay attention to. Those things live over, if you look to the left here, you've got the security and manual actions, and if you had something here, you have no issues detected. But if you did, it would be on the overview page loud and clear, and that is something to address immediately because it means you are being actively penalized by Google. All right, so a couple of cool things. Well, first of all, actually, let me just say one other thing here, too. What's really important, what I think is a very important tool that is really awesome with Search Console is that you can put your site map right in here and basically submit your site map, and then you can make sure that Google is reading your site map. So your site map is going to have basically all of your... It's going to have all your content. It's going to have your pages and your posts and stuff like that.

[00:29:29.120] - Nikki, Posts by Ghost
But this is a nice way to just make sure it's working. I mean, it should read it pretty much every day. This is the last read couple of days ago. That's what we want. We can check and it says, Oh, it's success. There's no errors. If there's any errors with anything, it'll tell you and that's really handy. Okay, so another really cool feature that I really think is great is this URL inspection tool. Now, the URL inspection tool is just this bar right up at the top here. What you can do with this is a few things. First of all, it allows you to look and see if something is on Google and if it's got any problems. I'm just going to put a post in here, and it's going to take a look at what's going on with Google. It's going to look it up, and it's going to tell me what's going on. I can just take a couple of seconds here. Okay, so then it shows up and it says, URL is on Google. Hey, awesome. I can click this open and it'll say, Submitted an index. That's because it's in my site map, and I can see that it just looked at it on the 19th.

[00:30:31.170] - Nikki, Posts by Ghost
That's awesome. I can see down here, it'll tell me if there's anything that has errors. Now, a lot of the time where you will have errors is stuff like if you are using a recipe plugin and you have, it's called schema markup is what recipe plugins do. This will tell you if there are errors with how your content is structured in your plugin and that's stuff that you would want to go fix right away. But here's another reason that this is really cool. If you go on here, it'll also tell you, it'll say, URL is not on Google, and that's something to check as well. Let's say you want to make sure something actually got no index, right? This will tell you it's not on there, it'll tell you why and whatever, which is really helpful, and you can be like, Awesome, that's what I want. There's also a button over here on the right that says to test your live URL. This ran a few days ago. If I want to test the live URL to make sure that it's still up, maybe I changed something or maybe something was going weird with my blog, then I can test the live URL.

[00:31:36.080] - Nikki, Posts by Ghost
I'm not going to do that because it takes a couple of minutes and it's annoying. But then you can just make sure you get up to date information. But here is the other super cool thing about this. Let's say you go back to this post and you're like, Okay, I am improving this. It's awesome now. I want Google to know that I have purposely improved this. It's optimized. I'm stoked. I don't want to wait. Google usually gets around it. Especially if you have a site map submitted and you update your content regularly, Google is usually looking through your content pretty frequently. But let's say I'm like, No, I want to make sure that this is on Google's radar because I just updated it. This right here, page change request indexing, and I didn't update this, so I'm not going to click it, but you literally can just click this and it's going to get it up on Google's radar and get it in queue so that Google is going to look at it just a little bit more quickly, which gives you a little bit more of a head start in terms of getting that back on Google's radar and all of that.

[00:32:34.330] - Nikki, Posts by Ghost
One thing I will say is do not abuse this tool. It's something where you probably only want to submit. I usually say, a handful of URLs a day. Now, if you're really improving your content and you're making it awesome, you probably aren't going to do five posts in a day. That's probably the upload.

[00:32:51.920] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Yeah, it takes time.

[00:32:53.220] - Nikki, Posts by Ghost
This shouldn't be a problem. But if you start submitting a lot of stuff in here, Google starts to get crappy and think you're trying to game the system or something, so pro tip on that. Then cool other thing, and this is something that's really great about Search Console, and that is that you just get a lot more in-depth information than you get in Google Analytics because it's specifically focused on Search, and you get a lot more keyword data, which you don't really get in Analytics ever since Search has been privatized, which was a sad day indeed, when that happened whenever that was 15 years ago. Anyway, so sad for us to do that. Anyway, so your performance report, if you open this report, there's a couple of cool things you can do. My favorite thing to do on here is, first of all, you can toggle these on and off.

[00:33:50.320] - Nikki, Posts by Ghost
This starts to look really crazy. Usually I try to maybe just look at one thing at a time because otherwise it's crazy. But cool thing you can do is basically there's a compare feature. If I want to see compare the last seven days to the previous period, I want to see how I'm doing this week compared to last week, but I can even look up. What I really like doing, especially is, and I'm not sure how much data I have in this one, so I'm not going to do it, but I like doing stuff like compare last three months year over year. This is really great for bloggers that have a lot of seasonal content. Let's say I want to look at October through December this year compared to last year or 2019 compared to 2018 or whatever. Because you don't want to compare that block to the previous three months because it's not going to give you.

[00:34:34.220] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Right- Totally. Yeah, exactly. Your personal finance blog for January traffic is always up.

[00:34:39.150] - Nikki, Posts by Ghost
Exactly.

[00:34:39.970] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Comparing January to December is not going to really help you figure out if you're improving year over year. In general, I think with SEO is usually the smarter play.

[00:34:49.720] - Nikki, Posts by Ghost
Oh, absolutely. Exactly. That's super true for a lot of things, especially anything, right? A DIY project might be more conducive to spring. Recipes show up more around Thanksgiving and Christmas, that stuff. I'm going to just compare, and I can click Apply, and then it's going to give me some nice little data. Now, what's really cool is it gives me data across these different metrics. I can see how many times it's been clicked on, so I have a little increase here. I can see the total impressions. Now, this is the thing. Impressions is data that you just can't get anywhere else. This is why Google Search Console is so cool, because impressions basically tells you how many times- Your.

[00:35:32.270] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Stuff showed up in search that people saw it, but they didn't necessarily click on it.

[00:35:36.370] - Nikki, Posts by Ghost
Exactly. That's such a cool data point because you can see like, okay, I showed... A lot of what we'll see sometimes... Well, sometimes what we'll see is like, I'm showing up more in search, but people aren't clicking. Then it's like, Okay, well, how can I optimize what they're seeing so that they click? Because it's showing up. They're like, What the heck? That's where your click-through rate will come into play as well. Then you've got average position, and that's just the average position of all your keywords. Don't be alarmed if this is a really, excuse me, high number just because it's all the keywords. It's not going to be like two or something. It's probably going to be something like this. Now, one thing that's also handy is with the new Search Console, which came out, I don't know, probably a year and a half ago or so, it's got a lot of features that help you navigate it. There's a lot of these little question marks where you can click these Learn More buttons. That's really handy if you're like, Okay, I don't remember what this is, and I don't know why it's important to me.

[00:36:37.440] - Nikki, Posts by Ghost
Lots of links to help issues and stuff like that. But here's where this can be really helpful. It doesn't actually matter which ones of these you toggle, but if you go down here... Well, actually, it does when you sort this report. It doesn't matter if you drop it into a Excel sheet, it doesn't matter. But anyway, for our purposes, we're looking at this. What's cool is you have a few different things here. For me, the main things are the queries and the pages. What you can do is, especially on this compare feature, click to sort by the difference.

[00:37:10.890] - Nikki, Posts by Ghost
If you're searching, especially year over year or something, these numbers are going to be much more dramatic than you're seeing right here. But if I see, okay, let's say these numbers are much bigger or something, but if I see my vegan pizza restaurant, that dropped 2,000 clicks and maybe 10,000 impressions or something like that. I can do the same thing on this and sort.

[00:37:33.200] - Liz Stapleton, Host
The.

[00:37:33.830] - Nikki, Posts by Ghost
Same way. Basically, what I want to do then is... Here, actually, the impressions have a little bit bigger numbers, so you can see how it's more dramatic. But that's the thing is this is going to tell you what top content is dropping, which is big and over time and stuff like that, so what you should maybe go ahead and improve. Then this is going to give you, Okay, which post should I work on and which ones... And then also what stuff's improving? And then it's like, Oh, and that might inspire you to do other... Don't do two posts that are too similar because that's keyword cannibalization. You don't want to do that. But this can also inspire you to be like, Oh, my readers actually like finding this type of stuff. Maybe I should have more recipes with meat substitutes or whatever. The same report goes for pages. Again, you can just sort by this difference. You can see, okay, these are my posts that are dropping in impressions or clicks or click-through rate, any of those things. Then you can evaluate why that's happening, where you're losing ground, what needs to happen, and all of that.

[00:38:42.630] - Nikki, Posts by Ghost
You can click right from here to inspect the URL, which it does that thing that we just did up here, which is nice because then you can say, Oh, is there something wrong with it? I can look at it and see like, Okay, what's going on? That's really handy. But that's the biggest thing for me in terms of why... Here, I just want to show you. Oh, I did it. That didn't work. I was going to show you something cool. Oh, well, whatever. But anyway, this URL is on Google. I can see it was submitted an index. That's what we want and what have you. Those are the main things that I think... I mean, there's a lot more you can do with Search Console. There really is, and there's a lot of cool stuff. But those are the main things that I.

[00:39:24.680] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Really like. Is there a good resource for learning more about how to use Google Search Console that you know of?

[00:39:31.530] - Nikki, Posts by Ghost
Yeah, that's a great question. Google Search Console, their help now is actually pretty good. They have basically a... If you Google it, there's a set of instructions basically for it. I have a whole unit in a course that I teach on it because for bloggers, there's some things that you can use a little differently and stuff like that. But yeah, the material from Google themselves is not too technical. It's pretty good now that they've revamped this. They really wanted this with the revamps about a year and a half ago or whatever that was. They really wanted it to be more accessible to not just people who are data nerds and me. I would just use their help sessions.

[00:40:24.040] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Yeah. Okay. No, good to know. That was fantastic. I certainly want to be respectful of your time. So any final words before we tell them a super awesome free thing you have for all the attendees? So any final words about SEO?

[00:40:39.230] - Nikki, Posts by Ghost
Well, I would say that in general, especially if you've been blogging a long time, getting a site audit is a really good idea because there's a lot of free tools out there that you can use to scan your site, and that's fine. But sometimes they're just going to give you this large dump of stuff, and you're like, What's the most important thing to do? Do I have to do everything on this list? What is this even? That stuff can be terrifying. When you get an audit, a person who will do a good audit like myself will, but we'll give you a plan of attack that's literally a step-by-step. Here's what to do, and here's where to focus your energy first, and here's what you don't need to worry about and that thing. But like I said, especially if you've been blogging a long time, and any good SEO audit, in my opinion, includes a content audit as well, but you can do that separately, and that can help you learn what's just working, what's just not. If you're like, Oh, I don't even know where I stand on SEO, an audit is a really, really good place to start.

[00:41:39.980] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Okay, yeah. Then you want to tell the attendees about the free thing you have for them, which I mean, who doesn't love free stuff? And this is so helpful. I have so much to dig into my Google search console because I know it was there, but I couldn't tell you the last time I looked at it. I definitely didn't know looking at it. I'm like, I need to get in there. I have a lot of homework to do, and I'm sure many other to you as well. But what do you have for our attendees?

[00:42:09.380] - Nikki, Posts by Ghost
Yeah. So basically we have our free SEO keyword checklist, and it's going to give you a nice little... Now it's not everything, but it gives you a nice little rundown on how to optimize a post for a specific keyword that's free. Then when you grab that, we're going to send you an offer basically for a discount on our playbook. That's going to give you a lot more information on how to do all this stuff and a lot of the things I've been talking about today, especially when it comes to getting that old content cleaned up, because for bloggers, that is just so huge. We've seen so many good results with doing stuff like that. I really want to make sure that you have those tools in your arsenal to do that because it can really make a huge difference in your search traffic.

[00:42:53.970] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Yeah. I mean, unlike some other sources of traffic, Google's been around. I feel like it's less volatile in a lot of ways than some other ones. So, I mean, yes, it goes through updates and there's dips and whatnot. But I think it is a more steady and reliable source of traffic than some other platforms out there. So definitely it's a great way to... Everyone uses Google.

[00:43:24.190] - Nikki, Posts by Ghost
Yeah. And the thing is that Google is always getting smarter, always improving. And the thing is, when you do this and you follow the best practices, it's not tricks, right? It's just practical ways. You're making your site better. You're making it better for your users, and that's why it's better in search. I mean, that's really it. It's a long term, that's what we need to be thinking about.

[00:43:46.070] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Yeah. So thank you. Thank you so much for sharing your knowledge. Super helpful. Your generosity with your time, I really appreciate it.

[00:43:53.480] - Nikki, Posts by Ghost
Oh, no, thank you for having me. This has been wonderful. I'm so excited to be part of this.

[00:43:58.630] - Liz Stapleton, Host

[00:00:12.840] - Niki
Hi, everyone. Welcome to the Blogger Breakthrough Summit. My name is Niki Robinson. I am president of Post by Ghost. We perform SEO and content marketing services for bloggers and businesses across the United States and the world.

[00:00:24.810] - Niki
So, today I'm going to talk to you about four totally free SEO tools that are actually worth using. So, most of these tools do what expensive SEO tools do, except at a fraction of the cost. So, these tools allow you to hone in on your SEO craft before committing to one of those more expensive paid tools if you want to go that route. All of the tools that I'm going through today are completely free. Plus, several of these tools allow you to take advantage of really expensive SEO tools without paying anything, which is amazing.

[00:00:53.970] - Niki
These are the free tools that I use the most that I think are going to be most helpful for you as a blogger. Please stay tuned for the whole thing because I've saved the best for last. Let's dive in. Here are the kinds of tools that we're going to go over today. There are four different tools.

[00:01:06.790] - Niki
Each one does one of these things. So, these are the best free SEO tools for determining if Google can find your page on search, on-page SEO improvements, competitor analysis, as well as keyword research. And there's a lot more you can do with these tools that I'm not even talking about. So, let's go. Tool number one.

[00:01:24.100] - Niki
Robots exclusion checker. You can use this tool to determine if Google can index your website. This is only available as a Chrome extension and it is completely free. So, an important part of blogging and making sure that your content is being seen on search is making sure that your site is what is called indexable. So, what we want is, every page that we want to have out on search, we want that to be able to be scanned by Google and available to Google to put up on the search results.

[00:01:55.080] - Niki
So, robots exclusion checker is really good for this. Whether you're on your home page or on a specific blog post page, this tool is going to tell you can Google see this. Being that it's Chrome extension, you're going to look up here in your little tray of icons. If you don't see it here, you can click the little puzzle piece and it's going to take you to all of your Chrome extensions. So, this one right here is for me.

[00:02:15.750] - Niki
It's a little robot guy. So, if you hover over it, you can see it says Robots Exclusion Checker has access to this site. Cool. So, this is a very, very easy tool to use. Once it's installed, which takes like 2 seconds, you just go to the page that you're concerned about.

[00:02:29.830] - Niki
So, this one, I'm just going to this blog post and I look up here and I see, oh my Robot Exclusion Checker is red which means that Google is having a hard time scanning this page. So, if I click on this Robot Exclusion Checker, it's going to tell me exactly what's going on in terms of why Google can't see this page. So, in this case, I see that this post has been marked as no index. Now, if I want this page to be out on Google, I need it to be indexed.

[00:02:58.390] - Niki
Most frequently, when you see a blocked no index page on your blog, it's going to be a function of whatever SEO plugin you're using. So if you're using Yoast, that plugin has an advanced tab, and at the bottom of that tab, it's going to say, do you want this post to show on search? And basically, you can select yes or no. Other plugins like Rank Map and All in one SEO, all have the same kind of function. That's typically the first place to look if you're seeing this blocked.

[00:03:25.210] - Niki
So, this is an indication that this post is not being found on search. Google can't find it. So, I need to go figure this out and unblock it. What's really handy about Robots Exclusion Checker is that it's a really clear red, yellow, green system. So, if I'm seeing red here, that's a big red flag, obviously.

[00:03:42.970] - Niki
Now if I go on the same site and go to my home page, I can see my Robot Exclusions Checker says it's green. And if I look here, it says Meta Robots is allowed, which means that Google is able to find this piece of content. So, robots exclusion checker is a great way to super quickly check is this page available to search or not? Which obviously, if we want it to rank, it has to be available. So, love this tool.

[00:04:11.250] - Niki
Super easy to use. Next up, SEO tool number two, Meta SEO Inspector. We can use this tool for on-page SEO analysis and fixes. It is completely free, and it is also only available as a Google Chrome extension. Meta SEO Inspector is also a Chrome extension, so you can find it up here in the little icon tray.

[00:04:30.580] - Niki
If you can't find it, again, hit the little puzzle piece, and then it will show you all of your Chrome extensions. Meta SEO Inspector looks like a little pair of yellow and blue light bulbs. Unlike Robots Exclusion Checker, these do not change color as far as I recall. So, this tool is awesome. I love this tool.

[00:04:49.480] - Niki
It's fantastic. So, what you do is go to a page on your website, and this is just a blog post. So, I'm going to go and click on the Meta SEO inspector. When I click it, it's going to open up this little box.

[00:05:02.230] - Niki
What this is going to do is give you hints on pretty much everything that you need to fix in your on-page SEO. So, this is not stuff that's subjective. This is stuff that just needs to exist on your website. It's supposed to be there. It's basic SEO elements.

[00:05:18.120] - Niki
So, if you get any warnings from this tool, it's definitely something that you want to address. One reason I like this tool is that each section has a little explanation and then frequently you will see things where it says tip and you can hover on that and it's going to give you more information about whatever the issue is. Another cool feature is that there's this little button for copying stuff. So, if you're like, I don't know what this is and something's wrong with it and you want to send it to your web developer, you would just click the little copy button. It's going to copy that automatically.

[00:05:47.250] - Niki
Then you can, for example, paste it into another document and send it right to your web developer and say, what is this? Can I fix it? Now this in particular was not wrong on this site. Instead, what you're looking for here is you're looking for red. It's going to be really, really obvious when something is wrong.

[00:06:01.840] - Niki
It highlights everything. So, here we can see that we have, you know, a meta description or canonical links in place, our robots file is working. You can see that because everything is green. Now when we scroll down, we're going to start to see more elements.

[00:06:14.640] - Niki
So, here I have a mobile usability issue. So, this would be a great example of something I would send to my web developer to say, oh, this looks like it's incorrect and should be fixed for better mobile usability. One thing I forget to mention when I open this up is another reason this tool is really great is because they keep it updated pretty frequently. Like you get regular updates on what they've improved, you know, the features they've changed all of that pretty regularly, which I really like. It shows that they're up to date on anything, you know, new in the SEO world.

[00:06:44.560] - Niki
So, if we scroll down here, we've got headers. Now this is an area that I see a lot of trouble in for a lot of bloggers. Okay? Because what I'll see is that your website is supposed to be arranged where you have like the H1 at the top. There's only supposed to be one H1 and then H2s are your section headers.

[00:07:03.340] - Niki
And then if you need a subheader under those, they should all be H3s So, this is a function of your HTML. Sometimes, it's not immediately obvious when you're back in there messing with it because you're just using what looks good aesthetically instead of following the proper order of H1, H2, H3, etc. And so, what we can see here is clearly an H5 doesn't go under an H3 that's sub to an H4 that's at the top. So, what we're seeing here is basically that this page is not laid out in a very good way.

[00:07:35.760] - Niki
That's going to help Google as well as readers, as well as any kind of reading assistance for Ada use. It's just not going to be clear what the layout of this page is. And so, it's going to give you some additional information on that. It's going to highlight what may or may not be wrong. This is really, really excellent for going through and looking at kind of what's going on with your page structure.

[00:07:55.800] - Niki
All right. So, as we come down here, we've got some more red. It's showing some additional errors with structure. Then if we scroll down more, we have anchors. So, this is going to tell you if you don't have any anchor text or alt text in your images. So, if you scroll down through here, it's going to give you a big red thing when things are missing, when you need to add additional parameters, information for your images, as well as good anchor text.

[00:08:21.360] - Niki
So, anchor text meaning the text that is contained within the link. So, when you hover over a link and the words turn a different color, those words are the anchor text. So, even though this looks a little complex, it's actually telling us like, this is what's missing and this is what you need. So, again, as we continue down, we're seeing more information about images. We have some that are missing some attributes, some that are missing, some sizing information.

[00:08:47.010] - Niki
This is going to tell you exactly what's missing. And it's also kind of neat because it's going to give you a clue, like what your alt tags are without having to go and like right-click, or go in and look at every image, right? Because like, what I want to do is look at my alt tags and see immediately like, okay, these look like they're more comprehensive. A little girl wearing sunglasses or hair tied up, like this is explaining this image. Okay, cool.

[00:09:11.710] - Niki
And these look like more comprehensive explanations. Whereas if I go to this image, it just says, water heating system is my Alt tag. Well, that's pretty weak, right? So, I can look for opportunities here as well for things that might be missing. And again, there's additional sections down here on links, how it looks.

[00:09:30.730] - Niki
Again, more tips and what have you. And one more thing I love about this tool is essentially a lot of the page elements are underlined, and it's going to give you a description of what that element is. So, if you've got something in here that's red and you're like, I don't even know what that is, you can click on it and it's going to open up a glossary that's going to help you understand what that is and where it needs to go, which I think is awesome. So, considering this tool is free, it gives you basically your on-page SEO issues all in one swoop. This brings us to SEO tool number three, which is called SEO Quake.

[00:10:04.500] - Niki
We can use this tool to analyze competition in the search engine results pages. This is also absolutely free. Good news for you guys. This is available on Chrome, Firefox, and for apple products. Important point to note about this tool is that you will need to set up an SEM Rush account, but just a free one, so you can capitalize on a lot of the cool features of SEM Rush without paying a dime.

[00:10:26.350] - Niki
So, keep in mind, you'll need to set that up and connect it to get this to work properly. All right. So, SEO Quake I also use as a Chrome extension, although it's available for other things. I use it a little differently though, and it works a little differently, which is really, really cool. And as I mentioned, I mean you're really, really capitalizing on SEM Rush as a tool without paying the extraordinary fees involved with SEM Rush. So, you're going to want to make sure that it's connected to your free SEM Rush account, which it'll tell you if it's not.

[00:10:56.670] - Niki
But here's where this Chrome extension comes into play, and it's super awesome. So, rather than using it to look at on-page stuff or I don't know, there's a lot of different options. If you click on it from the Chrome extension box, there's lots of different things you can look at, and it provides a lot of tools. But I actually think that the most opportunity lies in this functionality, which is if you go to your search engine results page, just go to Google, put in something, and let's say you want to rank for chocolate chip cookie recipe, which you probably won't if you're a new blogger, just so you know. But let's say that you want to go after this keyword.

[00:11:34.230] - Niki
So, you've got this little SEO quick box to the left here. So you're going to flip that on and it's going to give you some additional information. Now what you've mainly noticed probably is this little box is going to show up under each result. Okay? And this, I think, is what's really handy.

[00:11:49.800] - Niki
So, right here, this is just giving me some really basic information about kind of the site in general. And this helps me determine like, is the competition too steep? Can I compete on this level? Like some of the other tools, this also has some nice features in the sense that you can click things and get more information about them, which is really nice. It puts these results right into the search engine results page.

[00:12:13.260] - Niki
So, it's just injecting this right into here. So, I mean no matter what you're looking at, you're going to be able to see this box everywhere. One of the main things I like looking at is the authority score, which is this AS. Now there are many tools that use their own proprietary algorithms to develop this metric. But what this metric is telling us is basically how much authority this site has compared to ours. And if I'm looking at this and I'm seeing a lot of very high numbers here that's going to make it harder for my site to compete.

[00:12:42.840] - Niki
So, especially, if I'm someone who's just starting out, for example, cooking.nytimes.com, the authority score on that is 88. So, it's a number zero to 100. The higher to 100, the harder it is to compete with. So, I'm looking at a lot of really authoritative domains here. I've got a 63 and 88 to 51, a 68, 71.

[00:13:02.620] - Niki
Many bloggers are usually in the range of, I mean, from zero, of course. But I would say that some established bloggers tend to be, you know, maybe authority score of maybe 30 to 60. Just starting out, you're probably lucky if you have maybe like an 18 to 25. So, what we're looking at here is some very, very strong scores, which is giving me the opportunity to say, you know what, the competition on chocolate chip cookies is way steep, and I don't think it's going to be worth going after this keyword. There's also several other handy metrics on here.

[00:13:34.320] - Niki
So, for example, your visits, your average time spent on the site, your bounce rate, etc. So, these are giving me a clue like these. If I'm looking at 93.5 million visits, I'm looking at, you know, a pretty competitive site that's got a ton of traffic. So, this is another metric that's telling me, you know, wow, can I compete with a site that's got 93.5 million visits? Probably not.

[00:13:58.180] - Niki
So, this is also another metric that's helping me do that. Okay, so I took a look at something that's more of a niche result to see what we could do with that. So, I looked for banana waffles vegan flourless, which I didn't think was a thing, but apparently, it is, which is great. So, basically what we're looking for is potentially some lower metrics to see if this is a more competable keyword. Right?

[00:14:20.020] - Niki
So, here I've got authority scores of 50, 55, 59. But as we start getting down here, we've got 40, 40, you know, we're starting 41. I'm starting to get more into the territory that I can compete with. Okay. And of course, looking at the results, you know, we're seeing that these are more blogging type sites.

[00:14:37.630] - Niki
We're not competing with all recipes, we're not competing with New York Times, right? So, the other thing too is when we look at the metrics about the visits, right? So, we're looking for visit metrics. I've got a higher bounce rate, but a lot lower visits overall across the site, right. So, you know, as opposed to 93 million visitors, if I'm looking at 225,000, that is dramatically less.

[00:14:59.830] - Niki
And so that's telling me that these sites get less traffic in general. So that means they're easier to compete on. Now, there's a number of different metrics you can use and explore with this tool. One thing it also does, and I'm not affiliated with any of these sites that I'm looking at, by the way, but what it'll do is it'll put this bar across the top, and it'll give you some additional information about the site when you're on it. Now, I don't particularly like this feature because I find that it's not frequently accurate.

[00:15:27.730] - Niki
It takes a while to load, and if you're looking at a PDF within a web browser, it'll basically not show it to you. There's some sort of glitchiness around this. So, the good news is, though, is that you can easily flip SEO Quake on and off either in the search results or if you're on the page, you can just hit the little X here at the top, and it will say, disable SEO bar for this domain, and then I'm back looking at, you know just the page. Otherwise, I can flip it on and off over here if you don't want to cluttering up your search results when you're just trying to, you know, be a human being. The other thing that SEO Quake is great for is that it's going to give you some keyword metrics.

[00:16:06.210] - Niki
And so, we're going to see some keyword difficulty. Sometimes, we're going to see some additional reporting on that keyword right up here. You can also click here to open a full report on the keyword. There are some limitations about this because, again, it's just the free SEM Rush, not the full thing. So, I think there's limitations on usage and some other things.

[00:16:24.930] - Niki
But this gives you unprecedented access to a lot of metrics that you would only be able to find by running reporting in SEM rush. So, this is a wonderful way to kind of spy on your competition, see what everybody's doing out there, and choose keywords that you can compete on because you know what the competitors are doing. All right. Save the best for last. SEO tool number four, keywords everywhere. We can use this tool to find great keywords everywhere.

[00:16:49.620] - Niki
Now, kind of lied. This one is not completely free. However, I'm talking literally $10 a year is the average amount that people pay for this tool, and you can use it for free. This tool is available on Chrome and Firefox, and it is so worth it. All right, guys, get excited because this is really freaking cool.

[00:17:09.070] - Niki
So, to turn on keywords everywhere, you go into your Chrome extensions. And again, yes, I'm using a Chrome extension for this one, and there's a little K in a circle, and you're just going to turn that on. So, as I mentioned, this one is not completely free, but it does have a freemium version. So, there is a free version. However, some of the features I'm going to show you are not free.

[00:17:28.590] - Niki
But what I wanted to point out is that I wasn't kidding you about $10 a year. And that is evident when you look at how many credits I have left. I think I purchased 500,000 credits, I don't know, months ago. And I still have 421,000 left. And I use this all the time.

[00:17:45.190] - Niki
So, just letting you know that even if you spring for the paid version, it's still super cheap. So, you're going to turn this on and then I'm going to refresh my search results for best pizza recipe ever. And I am going to get all this cool stuff. So, like I said, this is great for keyword research. It's great for lots of other things.

[00:18:05.590] - Niki
There's tons of features actually, but I'm only going to go through a few of them because there's just so much to cover. So, what we use keywords everywhere for the most is keywords, as you may have guessed. So, here's what Keywords everywhere does. It puts keywords literally everywhere. Did you see all this stuff that came in when I turned that on? So, here's what you get.

[00:18:25.390] - Niki
You get, when you search, you get search volume, cost per click metrics, competition metrics, as well as trend metrics. Then if you come over here, you can look at the SEO difficulty off-page, on-page difficulty. You can click this to get a detailed breakdown on these search results and the authority ranks of each site that's ranking for them. If you scroll down, you can see trend data. For some reason, best pizza recipe ever was really an important thing in April of 2005, not really sure why.

[00:18:57.570] - Niki
If you scroll down even further, you get related keywords. You get people also search for, you get long tail keywords. And this is just going to give you a wealth of information about what kinds of keywords there are around this set of keywords. So, I can see by the domain authority again, this is the same type of score as the authority score.

[00:19:18.280] - Niki
That is an SEM rush, but it's [inaudible 00:19:20] domain authority score is pumped into here. So, I can actually see like, okay, the competition around unsurprisingly best pizza recipe ever is pretty steep. Okay. But there are some opportunities in here. There's some 30s, there's some 50s, you know some things I might be able to compete with.

[00:19:36.570] - Niki
Okay, cool. But honestly, I'm feeling like the best pizza recipe ever market is a little saturated. So, I want to look for a specific kind of pizza that I can make and post the recipe that I actually have a better chance of ranking for. So, this allows you to not only look through a ton of keywords and get keyword metrics for your competition, but also to save keywords that you find important to you, that you want to compare and contrast.

[00:20:00.570] - Niki
So, to do that, there's little stars by all the keywords. So, essentially, I'm just going to click that little star and it's going to add it to a list and I'll show you that in just a second. So, let's say, I scroll down here and I go, okay, wow. Margherita pizza recipe that's got 33,000 searches per month. I'm going to check that out.

[00:20:18.940] - Niki
Easy pizza recipes, okay. Let's see. I want to make a more specific kind of pizza that's maybe got a more niche market that I can maybe take over. Let's see. Best ever eggplant pizza recipe.

[00:20:30.060] - Niki
I'm going to start that one. But here's the cool thing. If I click this, now I'm going to start to hone in on this eggplant pizza idea, right? So, now I have keywords related to simply that pizza with eggplant topping, roasted eggplant pizza, eggplant parmigiana pizza. Okay.

[00:20:47.920] - Niki
And now I can look at these keywords here because here I'm looking at best ever eggplant pizza recipe, which is 70 searches per month. Okay? But pizza with eggplant topping is actually 480 searches per month. So that's given me a lot more volume than I would have expected for something that's a little more niche. Honestly, I didn't even think about putting eggplant on pizza.

[00:21:07.050] - Niki
It just sort of led me in this direction. So, now I'm seeing there's a lot of opportunity around that, right? And when I look at the search results here, I'm seeing domain authority scores that are all like, in the 40s, those get a little higher, I guess. But the top-ranking ones are still in their 40s as far as domain authority, which is pretty decent. So, here is where this gets really, really cool.

[00:21:27.480] - Niki
When I hover on this traffic metric, this is going to do a little pop up thing, and what it's going to tell me is exactly what keywords that these URLs rank for. So, I can literally just click this button, and it's going to give me a list of these keywords. Isn't this cool? Eggplant pizza, eggplant. And I can go ahead to see and add this.

[00:21:45.910] - Niki
I'm going to add all these keywords, so I can compare and contrast them, right? So, I'm going to do that, and then I'm going to look at the next one and see what they're ranking for. They've got 30 keywords. I'm going to look through those. Oops, this one's got a different one.

[00:22:00.510] - Niki
Pizza eggplant topping that the other one didn't have. That's got a hundred searches per month, or sorry, 480 searches per month, a 100 visits. That's the estimated traffic column. So, again, I can take a look at aubergine, which I can't say, but is, I believe how you say plant across the pond. So, if I look at that, that's actually got pretty high search volume as well.

[00:22:20.670] - Niki
So, maybe I want to incorporate that idea into here, eggplant for pizza. Okay, interesting. So, I've got all these keyword research now, and I want to just take a look at the ones that I have, you know, pulled out that I only want to focus on. Okay, So, then I want to compare all these keywords, right?

[00:22:37.830] - Niki
So, I'm going to go up to my Chrome browser extension with the little K here, and I'm going to click my favorite keywords. When I click that, it's only going to bring in the ones that I wanted to look at. I can look at more entries per page. I can sort by how much volume these are getting globally. So, if you look, I've got a nice set of high-volume keywords for a more niche version of pizza that's a little bit potentially easier to rank for.

[00:23:04.110] - Niki
So, this has just given me a wealth of keyword information in just a few clicks. Now there's no specific special login or anything for keywords everywhere other than within the browser. So, everything that you want to look at is in here. But look at these other features this, has bulk keywords data, analyzing on-page content trends, data competitor gap analysis, you know looking at what's ranking metrics, top-ranking pages.

[00:23:28.260] - Niki
I mean, there are just tons of stuff in here and it's just an awesome tool. And like I said, you cannot get better value for your buck for the paid features. And look how much we did with keywords. And I'm not even down that many credits. See?

[00:23:40.420] - Niki
Super cheap. So, when it says keywords everywhere, it's not lying. It actually pops keywords into other tools, which is freaking awesome also, right? So, if I'm looking at my Google Search Console and I want to know I have this early signs of water heater failure for this client, I want to know what it's ranking for and what those keyword metrics look like. Well, Google Search Console has all the other metrics around those keywords as far as they pertain to you, but it's not going to automatically put in general information about keywords.

[00:24:10.750] - Niki
So, if I filter by this URL, I can see the data over the last seven days for this particular post, right? And if I scroll down, I've got my keywords that this is ranking for. Okay? And I can expand this list. Sometimes, it takes a little bit to fill in, but now you can see that I have volume information built right into my search console. So, I can immediately see which of these keywords are maybe more meaty and better to go after for this particular post.

[00:24:42.910] - Niki
What's really awesome about this is when you have content that's already ranking for keywords, this is literally just built in keyword research. You simply look at the keywords your post is already ranking for, pull out what you can potentially optimize for and then do so. It's awesome. So, likewise, it posts keywords into YouTube, into Google Analytics, and I'm sure a few other places, but I mainly use it in those. So, yeah.

[00:25:06.630] - Niki
How cool is keywords everywhere? I think it's great. Hope that wraps up our free SEO tools that are actually worth using. Thank you so much for attending this session. I really appreciate it.

[00:25:16.450] - Niki
Again. My name is Niki Robinson, president of Post by Ghost. And if you haven't met me before, I am a Google Search Console enthusiast. So, I'm giving you a free code to my Google Search Console secrets class. The code and the class and the tool are also all free.

[00:25:32.650] - Niki
Thanks. So much. Have a great rest of your summit.

[00:00:12.270] - Niki Robinson
Hi, everyone. Welcome to the Blogger Breakthrough Summit. I am super excited to be here today. I'm Niki Robinson of Post by Ghost. Today, we're going to talk about three surprising ways to outrank your competition using AI plus your brain. Let's get started. The first way that you're going to outrank your competition is to understand what's happening with Google and LLMs lately. And I know it's been a mess, but bear with me and I'll explain where we are and where we're going. So I think it's important to note that Google is still the largest traffic referrer on the Web. Let me show you what I mean. So looking at this chart, we can see that Google refers 64% of all traffic on the Web. So I just want you to get your head around that because what I'm saying here is that Google is the Web's largest traffic referrer of anything, like any other platform, any other social media, any other thing. Google is what is going to be driving the most traffic. So you might be seeing that this chart from SparkToro is from January of 2024, and now we're at a year later. How has this changed?

[00:01:19.480] - Niki Robinson
That is a great question. We don't have specific numbers yet, but there's a lot of things that we can tell very easily right now. First of all, let's just look at the timeline. Chatgpt was November of 2022. Then we had, let's see, Perplexity in December of 2022. Perplexity AI is an AI search engine. Yes, it has been around that long. Then we have, let's see, Microsoft Copilot, which was like Bing Chat, which was February of 2023. Then we've got ChatGPT with Bing, which was September of 2023, and Gemini, which is also Google was December of 2023. What I'm saying is that AI, Large Language Model, Search Engine results have actually been a thing for a year before this chart was even made. Then also now, as we are here later, we just had the release of ChatGPT Search, which was October 2024. What we're seeing is, yeah, people are diversifying. People are using these AI, LLM, integrated search tools. But what I'm saying is the adoption rate has not been as quick and as effective as they want you to believe. Plus, Google has dominated the scene for 20 years. It's going to take a while for Google to be replaced by something else.

[00:02:48.290] - Niki Robinson
I'm saying this now because I didn't think this necessarily a year ago. I thought this was going to look a lot different, but Google has shown that it has the staying power. The reason that I'm pointing this out is because Google guidelines still hold true for a lot of the best stuff that's going to rank. I know we're all very frustrated with how things are going right now, but what I want to tell you is you're not actually competing against Google. You're actually competing against all these really crappy AI-generated content sites that have popped up. So the proportional share of your traffic might have gone down, but the traffic is still coming from Google. So we need to get back on the board and we need to make sure that we are still showing up in Google, but also that we're showing up for all these other AI search engines, including AI overviews, including ChatGPT search, and all of that stuff. So what I am saying is that it's all still search. No matter what people are using, if they're going to alternative search engines because they're not happy with Google, they're still using search engines, right?

[00:03:48.010] - Niki Robinson
I think we just need to keep that in perspective and also just keep in perspective what tools people are using and the fact that they're still using them to get to websites. So let's look at some examples. So granted, some of this information This is anecdotal because it's coming from me, but I have been testing different traffic patterns and paths for lots of our clients, as well as major sites and stuff like that over the last couple of years. And here's what we're seeing, okay? So this is one site that I wanted to use as an example. I'm not going to tell you who it is, but anyway, what you can see is a few things. So here we have 2023 views and users. Here we have 2024 views and users. What you're going to see, search traffic, one and a half. This is actually, I should point out that this is a range within the last three months, basically. 2023, we've got 1.5 million, and then 2024, we've got 1.2 million. You can see that there's some search traffic that has gone away. However, let's look at the numbers here. If we just look at the percentage of traffic that only came from Google, out of all the search traffic, the traffic that came from Google search was 96% in 2023.

[00:05:03.790] - Niki Robinson
In 2024, it was 95%. What this tells us, and this is a number that I've repeated across a number of experiments, is that Google is still the lion's share of search, and that includes these AI search tools and such. While AI overviews in Google are still experimental and they're still playing with those things, there's still a bunch of core updates that have just happened and that are coming, I'm still telling you that Google rules the roost, and it probably will for a while. One interesting thing that you can also see with traffic patterns is what has come in from tools like ChatGPT, Perplexity, and some of the other things that I mentioned, realizing also that Gemini is still Google. In 2023, we've got one person who showed up from some large language model. 2024, we're seeing an uptick. Totally cool. That's definitely what I've been seeing. Cross the board. However, this is This is not a massive amount of people proportionate to the amount of traffic that we're getting here. This is not a... This is a... This is one email to your list. I mean, this is nothing, basically, is what I'm saying. So these tools are coming on the scene.

[00:06:15.480] - Niki Robinson
They're definitely being used. They're definitely going to have more adoption. But right now, Google still rules the roost. So one thing I'll also say is despite the fact that this site had a downtick in search, in 2023, 56% of all traffic to this site came from Google. In 2024, 54%. So again, despite the downtick and what have you, we're still looking at a massive amount of traffic that comes to this site from Google. So whenever we can make Google happy, we still want to do that. Now, I have said for a really long time that Google's guidelines are definitely what Google aspires to be, not what Google is. If you caught my talk last year, I'm pretty sure I said that. I probably said it the year before, too. The thing is, is those guidelines still hold true. But But we can also use large language models to figure out how Google is thinking about things and therefore how to show up more frequently when our users are looking for our content. Google's algorithm is a little bit of a runaway thing right now. It is a black box. Google has never known or understood exactly how it works, but nevertheless, they're still trying to figure out better ways to show real content to real users who want it instead of AI-generated crap.

[00:07:29.950] - Niki Robinson
This is going to be a long process. Let me just give you some options about things you can do to mitigate the large language model situation and where we are right now. Raptive, the Ad Network, formerly Ad Thrive, has an article here that's quite helpful about how to manually block common AI crawlers. However, they did get a few things wrong, and I want to address that. Also, this person has the same name spelling as me, but it is not me, so just FYI. Okay, so here's this section that says how it works. Basically, in your robots file, which is the file that tells Google what to look at on your website, and other crawling bots, it tells them what to look at and what they can look at and what they can't, you want to rule out these user agents that are crawling your site so that they can use your content to train large language models. There's a few problems with this if you haven't moved on it yet. One, all of these models trained on content that was out there without telling us how to do this in the first place. Basically, if you have had a site that has been out there for a while, it is highly likely that your content has already been used to train models and there's nothing you can do about that.

[00:08:45.050] - Niki Robinson
The other reason that this is not super great is because, yeah, you can disallow these different specific bots, but if anybody else generates any other bot to train any other model, which will certainly happen and is already happening, if your site is on the Internet, it can be crawled, scraped, and used to generate AI content. So essentially, I'm not sure that this is actually even that useful because the other side of it, too, is that your robot's file is a suggestion. All of these things are still indexable. This is just saying, Hey, if you could just not, that would be great. But it doesn't mean that these bots actually have to follow these rules. The other thing is that we want to be careful that we don't disallow something, meaning block them from the website, site if they're going to play into some of these other AI search models. What you're going to see down here in this article is an explanation of what these different user agent bots are that crawl your site and then absorb your content into their large language model. What you're going to notice here is this, which I found very interesting.

[00:09:53.370] - Niki Robinson
Chatgpt bot. You can block ChatGPT from using your content for their large language models by putting this disallow command in there for the ChatGPT bot. However, you're going to look at this here. It says, ChatGPT bot also includes ChatGPT user, which is necessary for a site to appear in Open AI's web-enabled searches. But the traffic from this source is currently so minimal that we still recommend blocking this user agent. Because we are just on the cusp of ChatGPT releasing search, despite the fact that these AI search engines have existed for a long time, ChatGPT search may prove to be one of the more popular ones. Right now, I'm torn. I don't like that these large language models have absorbed all of our content and are using it to plagiarize our good stuff and make crap. I hate that. My team has written thousands and thousands and thousands and thousands of articles, and they are all really good and they've been stolen. That said, I don't I want to reduce the possibility of showing up in search wherever. But there's another interesting part here. So what I did was I took a look at a Raptive site that had and currently still has these things blocked in their robots file.

[00:11:18.260] - Niki Robinson
They're blocking everything here. It's set up pretty much exactly like this. I went on to ChatGPT search, and I searched for things that were on this website. And not exactly to my surprise, but many of the things that are on this website showed up, even though they have this ChatGPT bot blocked. So I went to take a deeper dive and to figure out what's going on there. So in this case, I actually asked ChatGPT, and it gave me an answer that actually made a lot of sense. So the red line, that is the Raptive site that has the ChatGPT bot blocked. So I said, Hey, this site has the bot blocked. Why does it show up here? Meaning in ChatGPT search. It says it's configured its robot file to disallow certain kinds of web crawers, including those used by ChatGPT. This means that ChatGPT's web Crawler ChatGPT bot is instructed not to access or index the site's content. However, ChatGPT can still provide information about the site through other means. User inputs, so if anybody wants to share your information or if they're doing competitor research and they plop your stuff into the model to do that, which is some of the stuff that I'm going to show you how to do, then your stuff has already been absorbed into the model and there's nothing you can do about that.

[00:12:38.090] - Niki Robinson
Then additionally, this publicly available data, item number 2 here, it includes a wide range of publicly available information up to September of 2021. If their content was accessible on the internet before this date, it may be part of the model's knowledge base. Basically, that means there's a window of time in which the AI model was still absorbed absorbing the content well past September of 2021. Basically, if you put these commands into your robots. Txt, it's not going to retroactively remove you from any of these search engines. If you're still deciding on it, it's like, I don't know what the point is anymore because basically we only knew how to do this after it was too late. It's pointless, honestly. If you're blocking this bot, you are blocking showing up in the recently released ChatGPT search. I just think that blocking yourself from any search engine is going to give you worse results than if you actually participate. The other somewhat ironic part of this as well is that when you block your site and your content from large language models, it means that the large language models do not train on your content, which means that the same large language models that help Google determine which content is the best then will not be trained on your content and how you put words together.

[00:13:59.340] - Niki Robinson
Just something to think about. However, the jury is still a little bit out on this, so you can use your own thoughts, opinions, and experiences. It is up to you. That is my take. I just want to make sure you all have the full picture. Number two way that you can outrank your competition on search is to use ChatGPT to group keywords and create outlines. I'm going to show you a couple of ways that I've been doing it. However, I'd like to make a point, and that is that ChatGPT can be finicky, and sometimes you have to play around with it to get it to do the right thing. Sometimes you can give it the exact same prompt over and over, and it is going to give you different results every time. That's why you want to be really specific with your prompting. I'm going to give you some ideas, and you can expand upon them as you please. What I like to say about ChatGPT is that 60% of the time it works every time. This is an Anchorman quote. Moving on. Here's a couple of things that you can do to help with your content creation using ChatGPT.

[00:15:01.960] - Niki Robinson
Here I have an example from a manufacturing client. Essentially, this is a really simple prompt, but what ended up happening was we did a ton of keyword research, we did a ton of competitor research, and we found this giant glob of keywords that we want to rank for. Essentially, now my task here is to take all these keywords and break them down into an ideation, into what are we going to write about? What are the big buckets? When I look at these keywords, what are the big buckets of things that we want to talk about? So essentially here I said, I'm going to give you a big glob of keywords, and I want you to sort it into the specific categories that I'm going to provide. So essentially I have, here's my glob of keywords, and then I have, here's the categories that I want them to fit in, and then it's going to break down the keywords into the buckets that I provided. So the other thing about this is that you don't have to provide the buckets. You could also tell it like, Hey, I have a glob of keywords. Can you please bucket into groups, into specific topics?

[00:16:03.990] - Niki Robinson
In this case, I gave it the buckets, and then it grouped the keywords accordingly, and it told me actually if there weren't any keywords that were applicable to any specific category. Then I also told it to plop the remaining keywords in an other bucket if they don't fit into the categories. This works pretty well. Similarly, we can basically give it a bucket of our competitor keywords and ask to give us, tell us what the competitor is writing about the most so that then we can take over those rankings. And so in this case, just uploading a plain old spreadsheet. This is just a list of keywords from a specific website. I just uploaded this document. You can do that in ChatGPT by using the little attached file here. I just plopped that in here. I said, I'm going to give you a file with competitor keywords. I need you to break out the specific recipe ideas. So now I'm going to show you how ChatGPT can help you outline your content as well. Unsurprisingly, I am not really pro-AI content. It's going to sound formulaic. If you don't know how to tell ChatGPT how to write your content, it will come out as poorly as whatever you put in.

[00:17:19.630] - Niki Robinson
If you're not putting in something good, that means that you need to go back and work on your writing anyway. I frequently say use ChatGPT to help you explore topics, to help you group ideas is to help you outline. But when it comes to writing, if you want content that's going to give you traction, it needs to be more unique than the content that ChatGPT produces. I'm going to step by step show you how to form an outline using your competitor's content. So right now I'm on Martha Stewart. I can only hope to establish as much domain authority as her. However, I looked at this, How to prune your orchids, and I'm taking a look at this content and I'm going, you know what? I think I can do better than this. I have more information to share about this than is shared here, and I think I can add more to this conversation and not just regurgitate what someone else has done, which is essentially what ChatGPT does when it writes something. Okay, I'm going to show you step-by-step how to do this. I'm a huge fan of Keywords Everywhere. This is the Chrome extension that you can grab to try it.

[00:18:23.480] - Niki Robinson
The thing is, is Keywords Everywhere is no longer free. However, it is really, really cheap. Basically, the stats are something like the average person spends $10 a year, so it's definitely worth it. What I want to do to start planning my orchid post and get my brain going is I want to look at what this post is already ranking for. To do that, I'm going to use my Chrome extension and I'm going to click this Organic Ranking Keywords by URL, and that is going to give me this list of keywords that this post ranks for. There's a lot of good high volume keywords in here. This looks like a really good opportunity for content creation. All I'm going to do is download this as an Excel file, which you can do simply by clicking the button here, and that ends up as a spreadsheet like this. Now, I didn't touch this spreadsheet at all. All I did was give it to ChatGPT with a few instructions. Here's what that looked like. I did this a second ago and it didn't save the graphic, but I'll explain that in a second. But basically it says, Hi, I'm going to upload a list of keywords and I'd like you to help me generate an outline for a post on the topic.

[00:19:28.030] - Niki Robinson
This is just the... Again, I used the attach file. It's literally just the spreadsheet I just showed you. I uploaded it. Then, and again, this is the 60% of the time. It works every time. In this case, it actually did parse out the keywords from the list that have the most potential. And then it asked me, do you want to focus on one of these or do you want to write it about everything? Well, to compete, I want to write about everything. I want this to be a comprehensive long form guide. I literally said that and then it gave me the outline. So here's the outline. Introduction, Orchid Anatomy, essential tools, how to prune, pruning techniques, best timing, troubleshooting, long term care, FAQ, conclusion. Oh my gosh, does AI love conclusion? That's another obvious trait of AI content is a lot of the time at the end, the H2 will be conclusion. No one does that. Here's the thing. This is going to help you incorporate all those keywords. This is going to help you jog your brain and organize your thoughts to try to get it together. You do not have to follow this exactly.

[00:20:38.190] - Niki Robinson
You may or may not include every piece of this, but this is giving you a pretty comprehensive overview of how you can write a piece of content, use those keywords, and do a more in-depth guide than Martha did. Our last and number three way that you can outrank your competition is to supercharge your keyword research with Google's predictive text and topical maps. Let's dive in. Okay, so let's say I'm searching for Anchorman, the movie. So I search for Anchorman. Hit Enter, and I've got Anchorman. I've got information about the movie. I've got the cast. I've got watch the movie. I've got reviews. I have all this information right here. Great. Cool. Now, let's say that I'm like, oh, yeah, Christina Applegate was in that. I want to learn more about her. The thing is, is once I go up here and start typing in Christina Applegate, I just put in the letter C-H and it brought up Christina Applegate right away. And the reason for this is because it knew I had just searched Anchorman. There are tons of other Christine, Christina's, etc. Lots of other C-H names, as you can see here. The first one it shows me is Christina Applegate.

[00:21:45.630] - Niki Robinson
Similarly, if I go to Will, Will Farrow is showing up. So what I'm saying is that you might be hearing things about topical maps in SEO. Well, what Google's predictive text is telling you is that it's telling you that it knows that these entities are related to each other. And whenever you can draw those parallels between your entities, meaning interlink them really good with good anchor text, that is playing into Google's model and helping Google understand how your text is related, as well as helping you show up and search for related types of content. Look at this. I put in best. What comes up first? Best comedy movies, best comedies, best Anchorman quotes, best comedies on Netflix, Will Farrell. All this stuff is giving us like, this is the next phase of what we want to write about here. We want to connect all these dots. I was just talking about topical maps. This is another strategy that you can use that basically plays upon the same technology that autofill Google's predictive text to give you a map of all the topics that you want to talk about within your blogging niche. In this case, please provide a topical map for topics related to Anchorman, the movie.

[00:23:02.120] - Niki Robinson
You can see right here, Creating a topical map for Anchorman, The Legend of Ron Burgany, involves breaking down themes, characters, settings, and related cultural impact points. This will provide a structure for potential articles, blog posts, and SEO-rich content. Here's a detailed topical map. And truly, this is like the simplest prompt I've probably ever written. Sometimes that's all you need. When we look at this, let's say I'm doing a niche site and it is only about Anchor Man, this is going to give me a map of all of the topics that ChatGPT and therefore other large language models understand as interrelated. Each of these things are entities. The noun, each thing that composes this topical map is a related entity. That is like, for example, when I went to search for then C. H. Christina, the first Christina that shows up is Christina Applegate. It's because Google knows that this content is related. When you play the same game with your content, it means that large language models, which is how Google operates, will understand your content, how it's interrelated, and therefore pull you up on rank. Here, look at all these things that we have to write about.

[00:24:09.330] - Niki Robinson
These could individually, easily be their own articles. We've got main topics, We want to do the plot. We want to talk about the characters, quotes and catch phrases. Each of these, that's an individual blog post. Themes. We can talk about the themes of all of these different things in the movie. We can make a unique blog post for each one of these and interrelate it with the other content. Behind the scenes, production and filming, etc. Cultural impact, lasting legacy, sequel, related media, pop culture and parody opportunities, audience and fan engagement, and then it actually plopped some SEO-driven questions and ideas. If you are looking for something that ChatGPT does not provide on your first shot, again, it's a conversation, so just ask for it. Say, Do you have any other SEO-driven questions and ideas? It's probably going spit something out. This plays into your internal linking structure as well. Anchor text is the blue underlined highlighted text that links to another page. This is a great example of how they've connected their topics together. What we have is the anchor text for this link is important to your plant's health. What you want your anchor text to be is basically a short, keyword-rich summary of where that person is going to go if they click the link.

[00:25:27.390] - Niki Robinson
If I hover on here, I can see that this goes to common house plant problems and what to do about them. So related to plant health, you are telling Google that you have content that is related to this because it's related to plant health. You're giving it a specific map to show that these two pieces of content are related and you're bridging that divide with the anchor text. You can see lots of other examples on this page, New York Botanical Garden. That is an off-site link, but very effective. This is a good backlink for New York Botanical Garden because you're getting it from a high authority domain like marthasteward.com, and it's going to link to the main homepage website of the New York Botanical Garden with this very rich anchor text that explains exactly what it is. This is literally the perfect backlink. Most importantly, though, we really want to give our readers a clue where they're going, and that is going to help Google connect the dots. Again, your anchor text is your bridge between your entities that's going to help Google and users to navigate your content better. Because good anchor text and internal link structure are truly ways to supercharge how you rank on Google.

[00:00:13.370] - Niki
Hi, everyone very excited to be part of the Blogger Breakthrough Summit this year. My name is Nikki Robinson. I'm President of Posts by Ghost. We're a team of writers and SEO experts that is search engine optimization, which is what we're going to be talking about all today. We work with businesses, but most importantly, bloggers from all over the globe. So a little bit about us, we go straight content, we perform keyword research.

[00:00:41.540] - Niki
We do post ideation, we do SEO audits, we fix SEO problems, but most importantly, we do content optimization, and that's what we're going to be talking about today. So this section is called Clean Up Your Content, how to identify and Improve high potential, but low performing content. So that basically means that especially if you've been blogging for a long time, you probably have a ton of content out there. And you may have some stuff that's older, and maybe it's not as good because you know we all get better as we go.

[00:01:10.890] - Niki
You may have stuff that frankly, you look back on and think, wow, I'm embarrassed.

[00:01:15.090] - Niki
I didn't even know that was out there still. But you also may look back and say, man, you know, I did this really cool project or you know I had this really cool recipe and it turned out really great. But when I look back at that content, I just know that it's not really up to snuff. Like, if I had produced that piece of content today, I would have done a lot different job. I would have done a lot better.

[00:01:39.630] - Niki
So what this session is about is going through your old content and cleaning it up. Okay. So why do we want to clean it up? Well, we really want to get rid of the clutter, and so, Google can focus on our really important, you know needy actual content. But we also want to make sure that everything we leave on our blog is absolutely the best quality that it can be.

[00:02:04.390] - Niki
We don't want to have half of our site being dragged down by pages that just need improvement. We want to do is work through that old content, get it cleaned up, get it optimized, get it as good as it can be and you know get it out there in front of Google. So, a lot of problems that bloggers have frequently is how to prioritize which content to work on. And that can be a little bit tricky. So what we're going to do is use Google Search console as a tool to help us identify which content is in that SEO zone, as we call it, you know the opportunity zone for SEO. And which content you should spend time on, whereas which content,

[00:02:43.310] - Niki
maybe you shouldn't. Important point of note, SEO is a long game. Okay, this isn't something that you're going to immediately pick your top six posts, optimize them, and then everything is done forever. What you're going to be doing is making strategic changes over time to improve your content, your website and therefore, the Internet. Google likes that. Honestly, cleaning up your content should be part of your regular blogging cycle.

[00:03:10.190] - Niki
It should be just as much of your calendar as you know creating a post every week. You should also be cleaning up a post every week, every other week, or making that part of a regular occurrence that happens on your blog. What you're going to want to do is clean up your content, republish it with a new date, submit it in Google Search console and call it a day. We're going to walk through exactly what all of that means in this discussion. And I'm going to show you exactly how to use Google Search console.

[00:03:40.240] - Niki
I'm also going to give you a workable process for prioritizing and taking action on that high potential low performing content.

[00:03:48.270] - Niki
All of the secrets really lie within Google Search console. And it's an awesome tool if you're not using it and it's free. So, there's really no better way, you know to get in and get in Google's head and see how Google sees your site. Alright, so enough intro. Let's dive in and get started. I'm really excited to show you guys some really actionable stuff that you can take away from today and apply to your blog.

[00:04:13.350] - Niki
Just to note, you may want to turn off your phone or put it in 'don't disturb' mode so that you can concentrate and take notes. I just want to make sure you don't miss anything because this is pretty, you know action pack and intense. And you know we're going to go through a lot in 30 minutes. So, let's get started. Okay, so quickly before we dive into Google Search console, I just want to walk through what I mean by optimizing your content. So, you'll notice in the slide here that we have common SEO terms.

[00:04:41.850] - Niki
Essentially, what we're looking to do is make sure that each of these pieces is optimized appropriately. And to the fullest extent. The more you make a point of ensuring that each of these bullet points are hit when you optimize a post, the more likelihood you'll have of it ranking. So, I don't want you to just go in there and kind of willy nilly rework the content. We really want to be strategic. And so, we're choosing a long-tail keyword and we're getting it in these different pieces.

[00:05:10.960] - Niki
But there's more to it than just putting the keywords in there. Now, if you think you already know all this and you really want to get to the Google search console part, just hang in here for 2 seconds. Because basically, you might miss something that is important that you need to include when you're optimizing your content. So, obviously, your post title is going to have your keyword in it. We want to make sure that it is really catchy and that it is something that people want to click on your post content.

[00:05:37.120] - Niki
Of course, we want to include your long-tail keywords or semantic keywords.

[00:05:41.150] - Niki
We want to get it really rich. But one thing I want to point out is you don't ever want to just add words to add words. We're not just, you know keyword stuffing. We're not just, you know making it longer or anything like that. We are adding rich meaty content to ensure that the post is really, really, exploring the extent of the topic as thoroughly as possible.

[00:06:02.000] - Niki
If it is something that only takes a certain amount of words to say, and that's all there is to say about it, that's fine. But if you are creating a project or if you're going through a philosophy or something, you really want to be as thorough as possible to ensure your best ranks. Your H2s. These are great places to include your long-tail focus keyword as well as semantic keywords. Think of your blog post like an outline. Your H1 is your post title.

[00:06:31.000] - Niki
Your H2 are your section headers, and then your H3 would be your subsection headers. And I usually don't recommend going further than that. Google uses H1, H2, H3 to understand the hierarchy of your content, just like an outline. So when we're not using these things appropriately, you know when we're using H3 instead of H2 because the font looks prettier, we don't want to ever do that because it really gets people confused about the layout of everything. Not to mention that certain accessibility tools, also understand how the content is structured because of the H1, H2, H3.

[00:07:03.430] - Niki
So we always want to make sure we're using that in the right order, really nicely breaking out sections where appropriate, including those long-tail and semantic keywords.

[00:07:13.030] - Niki
Then you also have the images in your post. One thing that's very often overlooked is your image name. So we're not just talking alt tags here, we're talking of the name of the actual file. So, you know including your keyword when appropriate, but you know you want to have it be, you know don't make the name of your image too long or anything. But make sure it's a little bit descriptive.

[00:07:36.300] - Niki
Make sure that it's really clear so that you know, you want it to be clear enough that you know, you have the words in there that make it easy for you to recognize what that photo is without seeing it. So that's one kind of hint. Right. And then secondarily, we want to go and get our alt tags in there for every image. So, we want to make sure that every alt tag is unique in every piece of content.

[00:07:56.990] - Niki
We're never repeating the same alt tag over and over. We're including our keywords when appropriate, but not to an extreme extent, only when they actually describe what is in the image. So, we're also writing our alt tags as though someone who may have trouble seeing well so that they would understand what the image is without having to see it. Alright. Seo title, definitely, want to make this one as catchy as possible, but really, really hone in on the keyword here.

[00:08:24.080] - Niki
So, the difference between your post title and your SEO title, your post title is kind of where you can maybe explore more like fun and add more about your personality. Make it a little longer, make it a little like oh, what's this about that kind of thing. But when it comes to your SEO title, you want it to include the focus keyword and you want it to be very clear what this is. You know, it's a guide about this, or it's a walk through here, or it's a, you know, it's how to do this.

[00:08:49.630] - Niki
It's very clear what it is. It doesn't mean you have to suck the personality out of anything to make your post rank. But for your SEO title, you just want to be really clear what the post is about. And then your post URL, that should be usually basically what your SEO title is. So, you want to keep that, most people say to keep it succinct.

[00:09:10.980] - Niki
But honestly, I've seen posts with rather long URLs ranked just fine. But what you really want to do is make sure those keywords are as close to the name of your blog as possible. So, it's, you know https/// you know the name of your site, and then, you know use those focus keywords upfront. But make sure the URL kind of makes sense. So, it should be like, you know how to plant your spring garden or whatever, but it should be specific.

[00:09:40.490] - Niki
Include the keywords and be really clear as to what the post is about. One thing about the post URL that is really, really important is when you're going back through. And especially these posts that I'm going to show you that are in this opportunity zone when you're going back through and looking at those. When you go ahead and go in and go buff those up and really, you know optimize and get all these bits and pieces in place that I'm talking about right now. If that post is ranking on page two, page three.

[00:10:05.030] - Niki
So let's say it's not ranking well, but it's ranking okay, but it's on the map. You absolutely don't want to change that post URL, because even if you set up a 301 redirect to the new URL that linked you, so to speak, really does not transfer as thoroughly as you like or hope from the old URL to the new URL.

[00:10:25.000] - Niki
So, this is another reason why people have to be careful, like, for example, changing their brand name or their blog name. I'm sure you've heard horror stories where someone changed, like rebrands and essentially all their traffic tanks. And even if they set it up correctly, it's just because Google doesn't always get it. So, you essentially just really want to not change that. Make sure you get it right out the door and don't mess with that because it's going to make Google confused. And that could make you lose the rankings that you have.

[00:10:53.770] - Niki
Your meta description definitely includes those keywords. Again, we're not plugging them in there just to plug them in. What we really want to do with the meta description is explore the user intent and make sure that it is explaining exactly what the post is about, and making the reader go, yes, I want to click that. Now, even though Google doesn't always pull the exact meta description, it's still important for Google and for readers to understand what that post is about.

[00:11:19.240] - Niki
So that meta description field is not something to take lightly. And then we have internal and external links. Now this is a little bit more involved, and I don't really have time to go into it all today. But you definitely want to make sure that your content is well linked, especially your internal links. Your internal links are telling Google which pieces of your content are most important. So, you really want to make sure that your relevant and related posts are really well interconnected within your own website.

[00:11:48.440] - Niki
It's the best way to give your own content a nice little boost and structure so that Google understands it.

[00:11:55.760] - Niki
So that means that, for example, your top menu should have really nice, you know categories. And then each category should be really clearly going to a certain set of posts, and all of those posts are related. And so, they're all interlinked together. You can link them together within the content you should. And then you can also say if you like this, read more, and have links to additional content in the bottom of the post. External links are a little bit more tricky. What I will say is that when you are buffing these up, definitely make sure that if you cite anything or if you're crediting someone else, or especially if you have a sponsored situation, make sure that you are using external links appropriately. Make sure that they have the appropriate, you know, follows on them.

[00:12:42.180] - Niki
If they're sponsored links, just making sure that those external links are put together correctly, put together thoroughly and well explained within your content.

[00:12:51.630] - Niki
When you don't have any external links that can look kind of fishy to Google. And you also want to make sure that you're only ever linking to really high-quality materials, high-quality quality sites, high-quality stuff. I usually say have any given link open in a new window, so have the link pop so to speak. So that's your basic rundown on optimization. Let's get right into Google Search console. Oh, wait. Before we pop right into Google search console, you're going to want to go and do yourself a huge favor and get keywords everywhere.

[00:13:21.710] - Niki
It is a Chrome or Firefox extension that integrates with Google Search console and unlocks a ton of data that you would otherwise need to look in a bunch of different places for.

[00:13:32.120] - Niki
And we're going to use this as I show you how to find this low performing, high potential content. It's unfortunately not free, although it used to be. So of course, now, it's not, but it is super affordable. So, you can see over here, I have 25,000 credits left. I believe it's like $10 for 100,000 credits, and I've only had to refill it like twice since I started using it or since it went paid.

[00:13:58.050] - Niki
So it's a really good deal. You're not going to spend a ton of money on this. Alright. Now, finally, the moment you've been waiting for, we are in Google Search console. And today we are going to be diving into the very exciting world of water heaters because I will not be sharing anyone's blog data. And this is the client where I can give you a good example.

[00:14:18.650] - Niki
So essentially, what you want to do is go to your Google search console. And here we are on the main page. And what we're going to do is focus on this performance section. So, I'm going to click Open report over here.

[00:14:32.570] - Niki
Okay. So now what I want to do is I want to find that high potential, low performing content. Right? So, the first thing I'm going to do is I'm going to go to this compare field. So right up here where it says date, you're going to click this little pencil. And then you're going to click over to this compare tab and you're going to compare last three months year over year.

[00:14:51.200] - Niki
Now, the reason I do year over year is because you know, basically, especially if you have holiday content or anything seasonal. We always want to compare what's happening this year to what's happening the same time last year. So if I do compare year over year, I'm going to click apply.

[00:15:08.970] - Niki
Okay. So, here we can see that our performance has been decreasing when I look at total clicks. When I look at total impressions. You know, Obviously, I'm not getting as much of my share of the pie in 2021 as I was in 2020. So, typically, a great place to start is make sure that you have clicks and impressions highlighted.

[00:15:27.420] - Niki
Make sure that your keywords everywhere is on. And as you can see, that's going to plop this volume data right into search console, which is awesome, because then you can see your data alongside the search volume without having to go into multiple tools. So, I really love that feature about keywords everywhere. What I'm going to do here, though, is I'm going to click on pages. And then I am going to sort by impressions difference, and you usually have to click two times here because what we're looking to do is get the most impressions lost.

[00:15:56.350] - Niki
So impressions are how often you show up in search, doesn't matter if somebody clicks or not.

[00:16:00.970] - Niki
That's just how often you show up. You may want to sort by clicks difference. Certainly, sorting by clicks is another way to go to determine which pieces of content are losing the most round. So again, I'm going to scroll down and I'm going to pick what I believe to be the most relevant content that I really want to work on. And right now, I'm totally trying to improve a certain service line.

[00:16:25.210] - Niki
Right. So, what I want to do is I want to look for what's the most relevant piece of content that I want to improve that's losing clicks, losing impressions, and just overall, losing ground. And for us, that is going to be water heater maintenance tips. So, I'm just going to go ahead and click on that. So what's cool is now what you'll notice is this is just going to filter if you look up here in this page section.

[00:16:48.370] - Niki
This is now just filtering by that one particular post. So, this is cool because you can get just the information for that post only. So, now, I'm going to go. Okay, you can see what we've lost here. We can see that our click through rate was never very good.

[00:17:03.360] - Niki
So, okay, this probably needed more attention right out the gate. And our average position has definitely decreased, but was never really that high. This field is not always as helpful as it could be, just so you know. But good news about this is, if you have any questions about what each of these things are, there's a little question mark over here where you can hover over it, read more about it, and even click to learn more to learn more. So, let's see.

[00:17:28.660] - Niki
So, basically, we're going to scroll down and now you can see it's just this one post that I want to work on because I'm losing ground. So, what I really want to do is make sure that this is truly in the opportunity zone. So, I'm going to click on queries. And now what I want to do is I'm going to unselect impressions, and I'm actually going to select average position, so that my data down here changes a bit. Sometimes, you have to refresh for the keywords everywhere data to flow in here, just FYI, which can be a little bit annoying.

[00:17:57.310] - Niki
But you'll see what I mean when it goes in here. So just a second. So, basically, you're going to want to do, right away, go to more rows per page down here at the bottom so that I can see more data. And again, all of these queries are only queries for this post. So, this is a great way to see.

[00:18:17.100] - Niki
Okay, where am I showing up in search for just this post. So, what I usually do first here when I'm in this section is click on position. And again, I'm clicking twice to get it to sort right now. What I'm going to notice first of all is that I'm going to notice some zeros. And so, the thing about this is zeros in this, if you have a position that used to exist, but now you do not.

[00:18:42.400] - Niki
That actually means that you've lost that keyword entirely. So, those keywords are definitely things that I want to pay attention to and see like, okay, did I lose anything important? So, for example, if I've lost price of a water heater, for this one, I was in position 53 anyway. So, I probably was never really ranking that well for this one in, you know in general. And as you can see, there's not any clicks or anything anyway. But I do want to pay attention to any keywords that I've lost that had, you know, page one ranks, especially in the top three positions.

[00:19:14.830] - Niki
So, what I'm going to do is I'm going to scroll through all of my zeros. And I'm looking for the first actual, you know, piece of data that is a true number. You can see we've lost a lot of keywords. That's not always a bad thing by the way I mean sometimes, you can lose keywords because you know Google no longer finds them relevant to that piece of content, and you know, perhaps they were already doing poorly.

[00:19:37.120] - Niki
I'm scrolling through things where we were ranking in a position 95, 98. I mean no one's ever seen these keywords anyway. I mean this one is, you know, this one is about furnace cleaning, so, you know, I mean obviously, that's not relevant. So, a lot of the times when you lose keywords, you do lose things that were never relevant in the first place. You definitely want to pay attention to keywords that you may have lost that are relevant. So, anyway, I'm going to keep scrolling down here until I get to a number and I get to a number here.

[00:20:04.340] - Niki
So, finally, at the very bottom here, I've got position 3.9. Now, as I said, the volume isn't flowing in here, which is kind of annoying. But my point is that position 3.9 is the best position I have for this entire post. So, I'm in position four, which is not in my ideal type three for water heater annual maintenance cost.

[00:20:27.780] - Niki
And I have to say, okay, is that keyword relevant to my content and you know, is positioned for something I'm happy with? And for this post, I'm going to say, yeah, it's relevant, but it's not exactly where I'm going, but at the same time, you know I think we can do better than position four being our best position. So, then I'm going to flip to the next page, scroll to the top, and just kind of get a clue where the rest of the keywords are here. So, after that one that's in position four, all the rest of my keywords are in position 9, 10, 11.

[00:20:58.170] - Niki
So, these are all floating on the page two.

[00:21:00.400] - Niki
And I can also see that I have, for example, you know lost certain positions here that I did want to rank for. So this is something to pay attention to here, like 3.6. I used to be for this one, water heater maintenance cost, and then now I'm in 9.5, which is way further down the page. So, in this case, we don't want the numbers to increase. And this is telling me like, okay, not great.

[00:21:24.950] - Niki
Now what we're looking for here is if I had a high volume keyword that was in position one, two, or three. Or if I had, like, a really high volume keyword, but I was in position like five or six, then I would say maybe I don't want to mess with this post yet. Maybe this is not one to prioritize right now because it's holding rank and it's doing pretty well. And that's the thing is like, you know we always want to improve our content to make it better. That is absolutely true.

[00:21:52.270] - Niki
But when we have things that are doing super, super well, a lot of the times, you know, I tend to err on the side of caution.

[00:21:58.800] - Niki
There are many other things you can do to your content rather than mess with things that are already doing well. So, I always take an approach to go with this middle ground content and you know, focus on this stuff rather than focusing on things that already are working. So, if we see here, I am in the opportunity zone. And by opportunity zone, I'm meaning like I'm on page, you know, like I said, that one had position four. But now I'm on like, you know, position 9, 10, you know, this is position, oh, sorry, this is page two.

[00:22:26.130] - Niki
You know nobody is probably finding this. And you can tell here that the one that I was ranking better in position 3.6 here. I've lost like, basically all of the clicks I was probably getting in that position. So, now I'm like, okay, I need to get this knocked up a notch, because what I'm trying to sell at this business is truly helping clients understand the cost of maintenance and what preventative maintenance does for this equipment.

[00:22:54.010] - Niki
So that's the point of it. And that's the traffic I'm trying to drive. So, again, relevance is most important here. So, now that I've identified that this is definitely one that is a, you know, in that opportunity zone, that's great. Now I'm going to narrow down my keyword focus.

[00:23:10.620] - Niki
So, now I want to say, okay, this post really focuses on maintenance. I've got a ton of keywords in here. And I don't know if I really want to deal with all of these keywords right now, because I feel like most of these are not going to be as relevant as I wanted them to be. And I need this one to focus on maintenance. So, now you can filter it down even more by clicking on new over here. And we're going to go query. So, here, I only want the keywords that say maintenance.

[00:23:36.220] - Niki
So, I'm going to go, you know maintenance, just make sure I'm casting a wide net. And I'm going to click apply. So, this is going to give me, you know, more of the relevant keywords that I'm looking for. Now, my keywords, keywords everywhere friendly decided to refresh. And so, I've got my keyword volume data in here. I can expand this to more rows per page.

[00:24:00.110] - Niki
And now what I have. And again, sometimes, you got to wait for these keywords everywhere to fill in. But now what I have here is I have a really cool, first of all, built-in keyword research. So, this is telling me, hey, here's a bunch of high-volume keywords that you are on the map for but you're not doing super well. But when I narrow down my keyword focus, I can see that I'm kind of on the map.

[00:24:25.360] - Niki
I mean poorly. Right? I'm on page like 2, 3, 4, 5, whatever, for a lot of these. But the thing is that I have my keyword research in my direction that's in here pretty clearly right now. And I can see where I want to go, and I can explore these different keywords, and see where I want to take this post. So, since I already filtered by the query, you know, and you don't have to filter by the query, you can always just, you know, work with the multitude of keywords in there.

[00:24:56.450] - Niki
This one had a ton. So, I was just trying to show you that you can filter by that. But what you can do then to get a nice built-in keyword research list is this little button down here shows up when you have keywords everywhere set up. You can also do the export from up here right in Google search console.

[00:25:13.030] - Niki
But this doesn't quite give you the data that I was looking to get right here. You can definitely experiment with that if you're not afraid of spreadsheets, the export tools can very much be your friend. But this is a very simple, quick export. I promise. If spreadsheets freak you out, you're going to just click this export CSV and open that up, and it's going to open into Excel.

[00:25:37.630] - Niki
And here all I need, this is going to give me trends over time and whatever, and you can use that information. Fine. But what I want to show you is just a really quick way to understand what's going on with your keywords, your built-in keyword research.

[00:25:53.550] - Niki
So, this is always going to drop everything that this post ranks for. So, just keep that in mind. But I'm going to just highlight everything, go up to data, go to sort. And then it says my data has headers. I want that checked, and I'm going to go volume sort by largest to smallest and click OK. Now if you look, I've got a built-in list of all of these really great long-tail high volume keywords that I can work into the post if appropriate.

[00:26:22.030] - Niki
Okay, again, this one, I'm focusing on maintenance. So, you know all these aren't going to apply to this exact post. But this is going to give me again that built-in keyword research for this post that is in that SEO zone because it's in that middle ground, right? It's like not doing that well, but it's like, so close to doing well that if we just give it some more oomph and really buff it up, and optimize to get all the pieces in place, we have a lot more opportunity to rank well for this piece of content.

[00:26:52.090] - Niki
Som back in Google search console, feel free to play around with these and toggle, you know compare month to month.

[00:26:59.300] - Niki
Compare different posts. Use different queries to filter and stuff like that. It's unfortunately not an amazing, amazing tool in that sense, you can only filter and sort certain ways. So, you really do want to plop it into Excel and work the magic there if you're getting really involved in this, but you can certainly get a nice, you know plan of attack. Literally,

[00:27:21.580] - Niki
you just can go right in here, and it'll say, here's where you're dropping and you can look and say, okay, yeah, I'm dropping, I'm not ranking well. And then you can say this is super relevant to my audience. And then you can go in and improve that post. So that's like the whole shebang for how to determine what's going on.

[00:27:38.720] - Niki
So, you can determine what's going on. You pick the post, you've improved it. Then what you want to do is go up here and use this URL inspection tool. So, this post is this one, I'm going to copy that right in there and click enter.

[00:27:54.710] - Niki
And then it says URL is on Google. We can see submitted an index. What you want to do is okay, I've improved this, I want Google to see that I improved it.

[00:28:03.660] - Niki
Now Google is certainly going to go and look at your site map if you have that submitted already and that's all in there correctly. And that's awesome. But I always say, let's try to get this on Google's radar as soon as possible and purposefully to say, hey, Google, I really did work on this. So, right over here to the right, you can see this says page changed request indexing.

[00:28:23.660] - Niki
And so essentially, you literally just click that and it will put it in the queue so that Google will look at it and say, oh, wow. Okay. This was definitely improved and then knock you up a notch. Now again, just like anything with search, you know it's not necessarily going to be the case where you're going to see immediate, immediate results. But what you want to do is keep cycling through your posts, keep doing this process with relevant content and get these improved, get them back on Google's radar and get Google focused on those really meaty, awesome pieces of content.

[00:28:59.870] - Niki
Alright, guys, thank you so much for sticking around for clean up your content. I had a really great time, and I know that I went through a lot of stuff very quickly. However, I promise I actually do it a lot slower and a lot more in-depth in my class Google Search Console secrets that you can get using the special promotional code just for Blogger Breakthrough Summit attendees. So, I hope you can check that out. I'd love to have you pop in there and learn a lot more about Google search console, and everything you can do to help you get more search traffic, get more, you know eyes on your content and you know make more money.

[00:29:37.500] - Niki
Alright. Thanks so much for having me, and it was wonderful. And I will talk to you guys later. Thanks.

**Transcript:**
[00:00:00.360] - Liz Stapleton, Host
All right guys, I'm excited to have this speaker back. She's spoken before. I always learn something new from her and end up with another tool that I'm like, ""I didn't know it could do that."" As President of Post by Ghosts, Niki Robinson's current passions include SEO, data analysis, and practical applications for artificial intelligence. She's the creator of the 90-day SEO Boot Camp for Bloggers, and she serves as the Milwaukee Story, Slam producer for the International Live Storytelling organization, The Moth. A big warm welcome back to Niki. Thank you so much for being here again.

[00:00:40.710] - Niki Robinson
Oh, thank you so much for having me. I really appreciate it. I always love being part of the summit.

[00:00:45.790] - Liz
Yeah. So we're going to be talking about AI, of course, but in some different context than we've covered in other sessions of the summit. Real quickly, let's give a reminder of do's and don'ts when you want to start using AI, and then we'll dive deeper into some other things.

[00:01:02.540] - Niki
Okay. So very briefly on that, I actually started a site just with only AI content from scratch to just see if I just crapped it out, what would it do? And it doesn't do much. I think I've gotten six clicks in two months or something. And it's not good content. It's fine, but it's super inconsistent. It's literally just spit out of a tool. I can't even remember. I think I'm using WriteSonic for that one. And basically, that's not the way to do it. I just wanted to test it to see what Google was seeing and what would happen, which I don't love putting more crap on the internet. That's not great.

[00:01:42.540] - Niki
But we also have to test these things to figure out what's going on. So yeah, anytime you're using any AI tool, definitely always fact-check. You're going to make sure it's in your voice. You're going to make sure it doesn't say something that's horrible, because I've seen some things that it's spit out that have been just really inappropriate. And so you really definitely want to review everything that any AI tool is going to help you produce. But that said, they can be extremely helpful for helping you be more productive about your work and hashing out ideas and stuff like that, places where you get stuck and things like that, really good for generating creativity and all that fun stuff when you're having —I mean, we've all had those days we were sitting there and you're like, ""I just cannot get this out."" So, yeah.

[00:02:29.460] - Liz
Okay, so you brought up something really interesting that I have not really dipped my toes in the water of yet, and it's building out your own AI. Can you explain what you mean by that and how you do that? And is it, I mean, can anyone actually do it? Is it super technical?

[00:02:45.920] - Niki
Yes. So I have been trying to be really on the forefront of this technology. And so fairly recently ChatGPT introduced, essentially you can build your own GPTs is what they're calling them, which is stupid. Some people are calling them babies, which is I don't know, also weird, whatever. There's not a good name for them yet. Maybe there will be soon. But essentially, they're also called AIs, building your own AI. Before ChatGPT introduced the capability to do that, I got in on the ground floor with a company called Mind Studio, and they have a product called YouAi, which you can find at 'YOU' as in y-o-u ai.ai [youai.ai]. Essentially, you can —well, actually, honestly, the best way to explain it is probably to show it. So should I just share my screen?

[00:03:39.710] - Liz
Yeah, I love a good screen share.

[00:03:41.450] - Niki
All right. Awesome. One moment. Okay. All right. So this is the homepage. You can see it's youai.ai, and this is MindStudio. And so what's really cool about MindStudio, and I'm not an affiliate or anything yet. So just so you know, on that front I'm not selling this for anyone else but myself. What's really cool about MindStudio, though, is that it is platform-agnostic. Essentially, you are not just limited to ChatGPT. You can use like Claude or Palm or all these. There's different AIs that —when I say AIs, I mean large language models basically, but there's different large language models that have different qualities, and some of them write things a little differently. I don't know. You have to play around and see what might work for you.

[00:04:32.900] - Niki
What's really neat about this also is that if you want to get started, I'm not going to go through how to create a whole thing because that would take a bit, but it is actually a lot easier than it sounds. What's really cool about this is you can explore their repository of AIs that other people have created. If you have a similar idea to one of these, you can actually take one of these and remix it into your own AI.

[00:04:59.460] - Niki
Why bloggers would use this is basically you can essentially create a clone of yourself. Now, I say clone very optimistically. There's still a ton of limitations. We've been experimenting with this a ton with different bloggers, obviously with permission and all of that. That's another thing is like using this ethically is like very much a —there's a lot of gray areas right now. The thing is, though, is that you can actually train it to understand the types of content that you write about and also your writing style, your brand voice, understand your target audience, and then help you create content more quickly in your own voice. Now, again, still need to review it, still need to fact-check it, all that fun stuff. But this is where the action is happening right now in my world. I've taken basically, some of these are remixed from other things. You can see remixed. I don't know, people —I basically dug into all these different types of AIs to try to figure out how they're built and then also be able to build my own.

[00:06:08.060] - Niki
I've been working on bringing family stories to life with mixed results. I have a bunch of family stories. This is totally applies to bloggers because the thing is too, is that the AI is going to learn from your stories and your quirks and your personality and all of that fun stuff. The one that I've had be fairly successful, that I actually created a whole website for is this, ""What's the big idea?"" All ""What's the big idea"" is —hang on. This is their landing page so it's ugly, but I did get a logo for it and whatever, made not by AI, by a person who designs logos. When you do this, it's basically like, ""Hi, I'm what's the big idea. I'm here to help you break down big ideas into small doable steps. What's your big idea that you need help make an action plan for?"" I can say something like, ""I want to learn to scuba dive,"" and it's going to spit out an action plan with steps, and it's going to tell me timelines on everything so that I can actually see how long this might take me. When this gets done writing this plan, it's also going to ask if you want any of these broken down into more detail. Here it did right here—and so what I can do is I can dive into step four and say, open water training dives.

[00:07:34.560] - Niki
I can specifically ask it for resources. ""Who should I contact?"" I can say, ""Can you tell me a little bit more about step four, or how can I get this accomplished faster?"" Or you can ask it whatever to basically get your big dream to come true. This is what I built in a hackathon over a weekend. The thing is that there's a lot of different pieces to building this out. Again, I'm not going to go through everything, but what I will say is that it is so much less complicated than you might think. Am I in the right one? Yeah. Okay.

[00:08:16.060] - Niki
The prompt that makes this happen is just this. I just told the AI what it is. ""You're a project management expert."" But I also applied my background in project management to help me understand or to help it understand what it needs to have, like a timeline, list of supplies, different things like that. But this is all the code that it takes. This one is actually super simple. You can actually build in these automations and have other things happen where you can have a conversation with you and ask you questions, different things.

[00:08:50.590] - Niki
There's message rules. Here's where I was talking about you can use different language models. They're adding more all the time. This one's built off of Claude because I feel like it has a more —less, I don't know, it has more personality, I guess. You can basically set the temperature of the AI to be more or less stable, which basically allows you to —if the closer you get to one, the more randomness it would produce, and therefore, the results can get really off the rails. This is a really simple example of what you could do with this, but it's really cool. It's a really neat tool.

[00:09:32.030] - Niki
The next step to this is basically creating something that is your own. I can't show you any of those right now because I'm working with people privately about these things because they're all new, and it's a very interesting time. But what is really neat about this is that basically, you can see there's data sources over here. Basically, you can upload a number of your blog posts, your About page, any information that you think that it would be valuable for the AI to help the AI understand who you are and how you write.

[00:10:10.170] - Niki
Another thing that I saw recommended that I think is super cool is basically, if you want to tell your blog story, your brand story, all of that, do a video of you talking about what you're passionate about, whatever you're blogging about, whatever your business is about, all of that, and then transcribe the video, which you can now do pretty efficiently automated. You might want to again, edit it, make sure that it makes sense, all of that. And then you can feed it in to this as a data source because that's like you being passionate about what you —and you're sharing your knowledge, sharing your excitement, talking the way that you talk. And so you're giving it really like firsthand you when you do that. So that's like a really neat thing you can do as well.

[00:10:53.710] - Niki
So yeah, there's tons of opportunity around this. As I was sharing, you can get —ChatGPT has this capability right now, but it's not as pretty as this. It only limits you to using ChatGPT. Also, it's not available to everybody yet. Whereas this, you could start this tomorrow if you want to. I believe you actually can start for free.

[00:11:18.600] - Niki
You can create as many as you want for free. But then if you want to do certain things, like have a subscription fee for it or whatever, then you have to pay either, I think the tiers currently are like $20 a month and then like $99 a month or something. But the idea would be that you would be then basically selling it as a product, which is not what we're talking about. If you want to build something that is you, you can probably use the free tier to do so, because I have many that I've worked on that are in the free tier that I can use for myself personally.

[00:11:54.170] - Niki
You can also make it private. It doesn't have to be like on the marketplace or anything. If you want this to just be you and just be a thing you built you can totally keep that to yourself. But just like anything, and Liz, I think you were touching on this earlier, it's like, you're still going to want to be careful about what you're putting in there. Okay, so when I'm saying these things about sharing your brand voice and your blog voice and your expertise and all of that, anything that you're going to already put on the internet is fair game because it's already going to be out there.

[00:12:29.580] - Niki
Somebody could steal it anyway. These AI tools are probably already scraping it anyway, whatever. But when it comes to sensitive data, basically, there's a lot of security concerns over how any of these tools use your data. And so maybe I should put my face back on instead of sharing this. So essentially, for example, I use ChatGPT and other tools and such to basically come up with like, ""Okay, I have an idea for a blog post,"" but I need to think about keywords or what should I cover? I need an outline because I feel like I just need some structure. It's not coming to me. I use it for that thing.

[00:13:12.580] - Liz
Yeah. So there's a tool I use, specifically I use because I'm able to set it, ""Hey, don't use my stuff for training or anything."" And so prime example, this summit, The Action Taker Workbook. Basically, after I'm transcribing the sessions, I'm pulling that transcript into this tool and I'm saying, ""Hey, give me an overview and list out all the tools that are mentioned. And what are the key actionable things?"" to just help me speed up and creating that I'm still doing stuff, I'm still creating things, but it just speeds it up so much more for me. But if I was concerned that that was going to end up training and being on the internet elsewhere, I wouldn't be putting it in there.

[00:13:57.440] - Niki
Yeah, that's still a concern. I mean, I don't know what you're using for that, but I'm very hesitant to put any sensitive data into any of these tools because I feel like there's a lot of also super gray area about terms and conditions and these things. And you can read that actually for this hackathon that I was just talking about, the AI that won actually, it's a terms of service summarizer, which is brilliant because yes, at the end of the day, you end up checking the box anyway, but you still want to know what you're checking the box for, right? But I've used, I mean, it shouldn't be a mystery that we're recording this on Zoom. Zoom just recently released the AI summary and AI companion tools, and we use those in our meetings with clients. If it's something where I need very detailed timestamped information, like we're information gathering, there's a lot going on, then I need my assistant person to be in there and doing that. But when it comes to just like, ""Oh, we're just talking through a project and talking through where we are,"" it does a fairly good job of saying like, ""Well, here's what you talked about, and here's the takeaways.""

[00:15:02.560] - Niki
And I mean, for meeting stuff, that's super helpful, because the other thing is my assistant could be doing something else that would be much more valuable for her time. And I'm not saying that whatever tool you're using, it's possible that they may have a lockdown on that. But it just makes me really nervous because I feel like there's also just like OpenAI just fired their CEO and there's all this about not being transparent and everything. I'm like, OpenAI runs ChatGPT, and if we're already concerned about transparency on the CEO level, that does not bode well for their tool.

[00:15:40.770] - Niki
I had to actually submit a form requesting that they not use mine. So, it was like a multiple-step thing. But I was like, okay, but the tool was like, ""here's how you do that. And we don't collect it either."" I was like, okay. So, yeah, that was...

[00:15:58.400] - Niki
Yeah, there was one that I wanted to use, which I still might, but it's a tool that basically records. So we were doing it to improve our procedures, basically, our internal process on how we do things. Actually, hang on. What was I going to say with that? Oh, my God, my train of thought.

[00:16:19.610] - Liz
There's a tool you're thinking of using and you might still, but you're not sure.

[00:16:23.350] - Niki
Yes. Thank you. So basically, it allows you to basically record your screen while you are working through a process, and then it gives you a guided procedure.

[00:16:32.950] - Liz
Oh, yeah. I see that. Tango does that, and there's a couple of others that do it as well. Yeah.

[00:16:38.620] - Niki
Yeah. And so the one tool I was looking at, though, I was like, ""I don't know about this because I'm just recording how we do everything in our business, and then it's where? Who gets that?"" And that's freaky. So that's a reason why there are some really powerful data analysis tools that are in some of these AIs, but I'm very hesitant to upload anything that's like website statistics or something from my Google Search Console that says, "" Here's all these keywords that you rank for and whatever."" I don't know. I mean, if you ask, if you go to ChatGPT and ask it like, ""Hey, if you go and say, what did my competitor tell you yesterday or something,"" it's going to be like, ""I can't tell you what other people tell you."" But there's been many examples of people working around these things by telling it like, ""well, pretend you're writing a murder mystery book, and I need to know. You're Sherlock Holmes, and you need to figure this out and whatever, and then report back to the police or I don't know, whatever."" But you can toy with it and manipulate it. That's the thing, they've gotten better at locking down those workarounds.

[00:17:54.400] - Niki
But some people have exploited it pretty heavily. I don't think that's the end of that. I'm still on err on the side of caution. But again, like I said, if this is all stuff that's on your website and whatever anyway...

[00:18:09.280] - Liz
Public-facing.

[00:18:10.390] - Niki
Yeah, public-facing. Right. It's out there. It's out there anyway. I also have had the question, speaking of, should I block AI tools from scraping my site? There are SEOs out there that are like, ""Oh, my gosh, everyone should lock down their content. You should not allow any of these bots to scan your site."" Well, the problem with that is that...

[00:18:33.130] - Liz
Google's a bot.

[00:18:34.740] - Niki
Yeah. If you want to be on Search, you need to have a scannable website, and it needs to be accessible by multiple tools including Google, Bing, DuckDuckGo, all those other things. And if you want to do any SEO analysis, if you want to have Semrush scan your site for some reason, for lots of reasons, but to analyze your SEO and all of that, it has to do that. You can put directives in your robots.txt files that specifically say, ""I don't want OpenAI, ChatGPT,"" and there's a few others that actually have this bot- blocking-coding that you can put out there. However, it's so funny because it could be argued that OpenAI, I might bite myself in the butt for saying this, it could be argued that some of these more popular tools are maybe the more ethical ones at this point because there is a lot of oversight on this. What I'm saying, I guess, is that you can block these specific tools, but you're not blocking it from everybody. There's other tools that are coming about. People are making new large language models all the time, and they're using internet content to train their models.

[00:19:45.550] - Niki
It sucks, but it is what it is. It's always something we've run the risk of. When you publish something online, it's online, and somebody cannot —hopefully not all of us, but many of us have had content stolen and that thing, and this makes it easier to do that. With WriteSonic, the tool that I was using for my crappy, just crap it out, just testing site, it literally pulls in the top —it'll give you a list of the top 10 sites ranking for the keyword you want to go after, and you select the sites. Then it's a plagiarism machine, and it turns their stuff into your stuff. That is insane and horrifying. But I think that, yes, bad things can be produced at scale, but good things can also be produced at scale. Really, we are always looking for things that are the highest quality. High quality. And again, we've just had this helpful content update and stuff like that. I mean, we're looking for —and the hidden gems update is like this whole other thing that's coming around that's been talked about a lot lately, too. We need good content that people want to read.

[00:21:01.990] - Niki
People want to read stories about other people, people want specific instructions on how to do something from somebody who already did it, but really good, meaty stuff that is showing your expertise.

[00:21:13.910] - Liz
When you think about it, the rise of influencers and social media is because people want to connect with people. And so that doesn't disappear just because it's a written content, a different form. So just keeping that in mind. I did want to just back up because you were mentioning keywords in AI. And before we hit record, you mentioned keywords everywhere in ChatGPT. And so if you could dig into that a little bit, explain what you were mentioning.

[00:21:42.570] - Niki
Yeah, absolutely. So basically with all these GPTs or babies or what have you, there's been tools that have been built upon ChatGPT and other tools, as I've mentioned. So there's some really cool stuff, and I'll do another screen share here that I wanted to show you. Okay, so I'm just in ChatGPT. If you guys have ever heard me talk before, I mean, I talk about ""Keywords Everywhere"" a lot. It's a chrome extension, and it's not free. Yeah, it's not free, but it's so cheap. And you get lots of different things you can do with it. And they've actually started releasing different tools that you can add on to related to this AI stuff. One of the things that if you just have Keywords Everywhere active on your chrome then it produces this window here where it says, it gives you these specific verbs. I know this sounds like so simple, and hopefully you can see it, but these little verbs just say, ""Clarify, exemplify, expand, explain, rewrite, shorten, tweetify."" The reason that these are helpful is because a lot of people, when they don't get what they want, they say, rewrite this.

[00:23:09.220] - Niki
ChatGPT does not know what to do with 'rewrite this.' But when you use these verbs, you can say, ""expand on this, explain this"". Well, that one actually did have rewrite. But basically, we want to use specific verbs to tell ChatGPT what to do so we can get it to give us what we want.

[00:23:24.610] - Niki
But it also has these templates that are built in. I've had mixed success with these, but you can basically do —I forgot where the blogging one is actually. I don't know. Here, it must be under —yeah, here. So blog writing, you can do a template. You can have it do an outline for you. It basically gives a prompt that allows you to put in what you want to do. You can tell it the tone you want to do. This is not the part. This is very simplistic as opposed to that whole training in AI ""to be you"" thing. But if you just want to get started with something that's super easy and just try this out and see what you can get out of it, this is a neat little thing that's just like built-in and something you can play around with and see what it can do for you.

[00:24:05.890] - Niki
Also, as you can see right here, it says, ""Remember that ChatGPT may hallucinate data, so always verify what it generates.""

[00:24:11.230] - Liz
I like that phrasing because it's always like, ""It's always factual,"" but hallucinate data. I like that phrasing.

[00:24:18.510] - Niki
Yeah. Actually, hallucination is what they're calling this now. They're saying that AI hallucinates, and it just makes stuff up. And that's really wild because we think like, wow, it must have an imagination or a brain, but it doesn't. And it's just that the way that large language models work is, basically every word is a token. And it's just generating what is the word that is most likely to come after this word in the context of all these words that we have. And so hallucination is possible because it's like how your brain, when you're thinking about you're out to dinner and you randomly think like, oh, I got to remember to tell somebody that I saw something or whatever. And you're connecting these random dots. And that's what it's doing, but not as —not in any way that remotely resembles a human brain. Artificial intelligence, quote-unquote, is also, it's not general artificial intelligence yet. We're calling this artificial intelligence, which is —kind of is, kind of isn't.

[00:25:13.280] - Niki
The other thing that's really neat, though, that they also produced is —actually, was this the ChatGPT one? I think, or sorry, was this the, I think this was the —yeah, no, this. Yes, it was. This is the Keywords Everywhere. They created this quality rater GPT. I've not played around with this a ton, but it's been really neat from what I have seen. You can basically ask it questions about all these things that fall under the quality raters guidelines, the helpful content update guidelines, all of the things that tell you what Google wants to see in your content. For example, can you evaluate the EEAT of my website? EEAT being Experience, Expertise, Authority, Trust, which is a big thing that everybody has been talking about for probably a year.

[00:26:01.790] - Liz
A couple of years now.

[00:26:02.720] - Niki
Yeah. Well, they just added the extra E. But yes. What do you think about website's user experience? Because a lot of the people that got hit with a helpful content update, what we have seen is just the usability of the site is not necessarily great. Now, that's a bigger conversation than we can have right now. But I will say that usability, like just being able to get on the site, get the information you need, all that stuff. Then is my website's content aligned with Google's guidelines? Can you see if my site's navigation is Google friendly? You can ask it anything in relation to these quality rater guidelines, and it will tell you what Google says about these different things.

[00:26:45.230] - Niki
I actually do want to say one thing about this, too. I was talking to this AI expert guy who is, he's won the Microsoft AI VIP award five years in a row or something. We were talking about how Google keeps giving everyone these guidelines, but it's been revealed pretty recently through Department of Justice records that Google can't actually recognize what good content is necessarily. That's where we're going to see a lot of craziness happening in the search results, and we're already seeing it with AI content and stuff like that.

[00:27:19.320] - Niki
What Google tells you to do is what Google aspires to be. I was talking to him about that.

[00:27:26.240] - Liz
They're faking it till they make it?

[00:27:28.040] - Niki
Yes, exactly. He actually thought that there would be a possibility of a totally new tool coming on the scene that would help us get where we want to go in a different way. But also we're seeing all this evolution around that already with these custom GPTs and different things. I don't know, some people in search have said like, ""Oh, people are only going to use these chatbots basically that they build to ask any question that they want."" I'm not sure that that's true. I mean, I don't think that I own a really old house. I'm not going to just have it spit out something that's like, ""How do I fix my electrical?"" Absolutely not. So yeah. So I think that there's still...

[00:28:10.990] - Liz
I think it's also important for us, we run online businesses, so we are very engaged. And yes, AI has gone mainstream discussion, but there are lots and lots of people that hardly use it at all, or use it very minimally, or they're like, ""Oh, I was playing around making silly photos."" It's a very different approach to what they're thinking about AI versus how you or I do it.

[00:28:40.580] - Niki
True.

[00:28:41.370] - Liz
I'm pretty sure the other adults in my house have never gotten on ChatGPT.

[00:28:48.920] - Niki
Sure. Yeah.

[00:28:51.630] - Niki
And that's really interesting because I think that's where these bots end up being impressive to people, because when you design something that can do something really specific, people go, ""Holy crap."" But it's like, you're actually just telling ChatGPT or one of these other tools how to do what they need to do. So you're just putting another prompt layer on top of it. Some of the ways that those MindStudio things can be built out are more complicated than that. But essentially, that is very much what you're doing. And actually on that note, Google is still Google. Google still has a...

[00:29:24.780] - Liz
Reigns Supreme.

[00:29:25.970] - Niki
Yes. Google still has the majority of everybody's attention and what have you. But one way that you can keep up on what is happening with Google Search is to turn on Google Labs. So you can just google ""Google Labs.""

[00:29:40.260] - Liz
I had it show up and then it said I couldn't do it under that Gmail account. I think it was because it was my business Gmail account. If I was on a personal one, I could do it.

[00:29:48.590] - Niki
Yeah. It also doesn't release all features to everybody. For example, right now you can turn on ""search generative experience,"" and you can turn on ""search generative experience while browsing."" One will give you an AI summary of your search results at the top for better or for worse. Usually, I have not found that super useful at all times. However, there are more opportunities for you to show up in the search right at the top there in those featured snippets basically there. But and then ""search generative experience while browsing"" is like, if I'm on a website on my phone, it has a flip up thing that will summarize the article I'm reading, which has not been also that helpful for me in that case. I'm reading the article. I don't need a summary because I was reading it. But I'm being that could apply across the board.

[00:30:34.000] - Niki
But what I do want to mention quickly is that there are a couple new features that are going to be in there soon for a lot of people. And that is that basically you're going to be able to add notes to search results where you can basically comment on a search result. And you can also follow a search results if you're interested in ...

[00:30:52.910] - Liz
Staying up to date?

[00:30:54.130] - Niki
Yeah.

[00:30:54.860] - Liz
Right. They got rid of Google alerts, I think, or they rolled them back or something. So I feel like that's the better —there was something similar that they discontinued. I don't know. Anyway. Because we've all done that, ""Where was that thing that I saw?"" like that.

[00:31:11.400] - Niki
Oh, I know. Google's been through like so many things where they're like, here's a product. Never mind. So absolutely. Yeah, I think Google Alerts is still a thing. But I think I know what you're talking about. And like some vague recollection or something similar. Yeah. And I don't know. This might be so this is something in Labs. It's in beta. It's going to be in beta. We're going to try it out. And maybe it won't be a thing. Maybe it will, but we'll see. So I don't know, exciting times. It's crazy.

[00:31:39.230] - Liz
Yes. Lots of exciting things happening in the world of AI and content creation. Okay, so I think we should wrap it up there. But where can people find you? Do you have something you want to share with them? Tell us all the things.

[00:31:53.290] - Niki
Yeah. So you can find me at postbyghost.com. It's posts plural, ghost singular. And you can always contact us through our website. And then there's also going to be a link below for a bonus that at the time of filming right now, I am not quite sure what that's going to be because I really do want it to be as up-to-date as possible with everything, how it's changing. But check for a link below for a very exciting, I'm sure, bonus.

[00:32:16.290] - Liz
Yeah, for the Speaker Bonus Bundle. And then if you have something just for attendees in general, I think that will also be linked below. So, Niki, once again, thank you for coming back. Again, I always, always learn something new from you. And I know everyone else probably does too.

[00:32:31.650] - Niki
Thank you so much for having me. Honestly, I always have so much fun.

[00:32:35.580] - Liz
Good. Okay.

**Transcript:**
[00:00:12.690] - Speaker 1
Hi, I'm Nina Clapperton, and welcome to my session of the Blogger Breakthrough Summit. I'm super excited to have you here today. We're going to talk about kind of a contentious topic, how to rank on Google with AI content. Now, I've gotten in a fair number of Twitter fights over whether or not this is possible. So let's debunk some myths, let's figure out if this is possible, and if it is, how to do it the right way.

[00:00:40.910] - Speaker 1
So, to get started, I wanted to introduce myself. I am Nina Clapperton. I am an SEO specialist and a six-figure travel blogger. I am the founder of sheknowsseo.co, and I'm Canadian. So you might hear some pretty deep stories in the boots happening throughout this lecture.

[00:00:59.740] - Speaker 1
I'm also a travel addict. I have lived in over twelve countries in the last ten years. I am a dog mom to a golden retriever named Theo, and it's become far too much of my personality since lockdown. And I am overall obsessed with helping bloggers achieve financial freedom through SEO. I really do believe it is the key to unlocking blogging success.

[00:01:24.790] - Speaker 1
Now, I really like playing camp games. I don't think I was allowed to go to camp often enough with a kid, so I try and do them now as an adult. So let's play a little game of two truths, one lie. So in the comments, just pop one, two, or three for whichever one you think is the lie.

[00:01:42.000] - Speaker 1
So, number one, I failed on law school because I found a $200 flight to New Zealand and then moved there. Number two, I started my blog for a school project. Number three, I made a $100 my first year blogging. So hope that was enough time, literally, one, two, or three.

[00:02:02.290] - Speaker 1
And now I'm going to reveal which one's the lie. It's actually number three, which I think most people expect someone doing a presentation on blogging to tell them about all their success. I want to tell you about my failures first. So, it took me four years combined to make my 1st $63 blogging. Most people, it doesn't take that long, but I made every mistake there is.

[00:02:28.630] - Speaker 1
And the biggest mistake I made was not learning about SEO, and when I did, waiting six months to implement it. So really, my success came from SEO. In fact, once I learned SEO, I went from about 10,000 page views a month. Within six months, I got into Mediavine, all while working for other jobs, one of which was full time. So, as you can see here, in May of 2022, I achieved my dream of getting into Mediavine.

[00:03:01.160] - Speaker 1
I grew in one month by 14.5 thousand sessions. And this wasn't like I'm not a superhero. Like I said, I was working four jobs. So how did I do this? Two things.

[00:03:15.120] - Speaker 1
One is SEO, I already told you that. Number two is an AI writer called Jasper, and we're going to talk more about how I did this because I really think this is something anyone can do. I'm really not special with this, I just dug down and then I figured out how to do it the right way.

[00:03:35.210] - Speaker 1
And through these successes with getting into Mediavine, by using a Jasper AI writer, I was able to see my 1st $10,000 month of passive income in July 2022, which is a far cry from literally seven months before when I had just peaked over that $63 barrier. Now, before we get started, we're going to cover a lot of stuff, and I want you focused. I'm a very distracted person. I'm always on my phone doing 10,000 things. But to get the most out of this session, you really need to focus on this.

[00:04:13.240] - Speaker 1
So get out of notebook and a pen and turn off everything else. Give your dog a marrow bone, put your kids in front of the iPad and let's dive in. Let's talk about the things that we're going to learn today. Number one is how to use AI for blogging. We're also going to talk about what AI even is, because it's a newer thing.

[00:04:34.480] - Speaker 1
You might not have heard of it, and that's totally okay. By the end of this, you need to know what it is. That way we can figure out if you should be using it and how to use it. But by the end of this, you'll be very certain of what AI is and exactly how it applies for blogging. Then we're going to talk about does google Rank AI content.

[00:04:54.040] - Speaker 1
This is going to be some debunking of myths. Some quotes are going to happen here. But this is really important to note, should you bother with this? Because why would we invest in an AI writer or create content if it's not going to bring us traffic?

[00:05:10.160] - Speaker 1
And then step three, we're going to combine my two great loves in this world, AI and SEO. And we're going to talk about best practices for SEO that you need to use in tandem with AI in order to rank. So let's dive right in. So the first question is, what is AI content and that's, people don't know.

[00:05:31.740] - Speaker 1
It's a very valid question. AI stands for artificial intelligence. And so when I'm talking about AI content, I'm talking about using an AI writer for some sort of AI program to help me create content. AI really means anything that is artificial intelligence. It's not just like some robot sitting on your desk talking at you, which I think is what, like a lot of us assume AI is going to be because of movies.

[00:06:00.190] - Speaker 1
Actually, you're probably using AI already. So, let's talk about different types of AI content. If you've used something like Yoast or Rank Math, they actually use AI to tell you about SEO. They use their AI systems to tell you how much you've used your keyword in your post. They even have a Rank Math Pro has like that AI content outline generator where it will read through to see if you need to adjust your content.

[00:06:28.310] - Speaker 1
There's other types as well. Technically, any keyword research tool is the form of AI, that way it's running in the background. It does have to think to determine what the keyword difficulty levels are and process information. And then some other ones include Surfer SEO and Rank IQ, which are more advanced keyword research tools that also help you create an SEO-optimized outline. But to do that, they are actually reading the top ten results on Google and then coming up with those mustwords, the keywords, the outline themselves.

[00:07:03.940] - Speaker 1
That's all examples of artificial intelligence thinking for us to better our blog. And I think you'll be surprised that you're probably already using it. So now my favorite AI writer is Jasper. I use a number of different forms of AI in my content creation. I've just listed a number of them there, but Jasper is the number one, like golden child in my little brood of AI tools, basically.

[00:07:31.090] - Speaker 1
Jasper AI, formerly Jarvis AI, formerly Conversion AI, they've had a few name changes over the years, but it is one of the fastest growing AI content writers on the market. In fact, they are eons away from what any of their competitors are doing.

[00:07:51.360] - Speaker 1
I have tried a number of other ones, such as Any Word, Write, Copy AI, all sorts of different ones, but Jasper really is kind of the upper echelon of AI content creators. And that's because Jasper can write long-form content, I've even used Jasper to write ebooks in like an afternoon. And really with this, it's like a little kind of robot writer working with you. And again, all inside your computer.

[00:08:18.930] - Speaker 1
There's no robot sitting on your desk, don't worry. So I want to ask you, with that in mind, have you ever used an AI on your blog before? And this could be in the form of Yoast, it could be in the form of Rank Math, or it could be something more advanced like Jasper. Just pop a yes or no in the comments and if you feel comfortable, share what you've used.

[00:08:44.050] - Speaker 1
So we're onto kind of the main meat of this, I guess, does Google Rank AI content. And if you're on Twitter and you follow any SEO specialist, you will see a number of them saying no, just outright, google hates AI content. Google hates AI. We can never use AI. But what they don't tell you is they're often using AI.

[00:09:08.270] - Speaker 1
And not even just those AI's I mentioned. They're using AI to generate content. So I pulled a quote here from Search Engine Journal in April 2022 from John Mueller, who is one of the executives over at Google, and he says content generated automatically using AI writing tools is against Google's webmaster guidelines. In 2022, we had the helpful content update, a number of spam updates, and what I find entertaining is my sites, which are over 90% AI content now.

[00:09:44.130] - Speaker 1
None of them got hit in any update from Google. It's the people who actually didn't use AI who got hit far more often than I did. And that's because they're typically using AI the wrong way. And I think it's very important to note that Google does rank AI content. Basically, what happens is people think that when they use an AI writer, they can let it write their full post.

[00:10:10.200] - Speaker 1
So if you go into Jasper, we'll do a demonstration in a moment. Essentially, you do command j is one of the commands, and it just lets him run, like, just keep writing for you, but you've given him no guidance. So I think of it like, if you ask, like, a school full of 8th graders, okay, write me an essay on a war. They're going to pick all sorts of different wars.

[00:10:33.050] - Speaker 1
They're going to have different ideas of, like, what to do and everything. And if you give them a textbook from ten years ago, and that's what they were learning off of, they'll be even more out of sorts. Whereas if you get some high schoolers or grade A's, whatever together, and you tell them, write me an essay on, I don't know, Viking outfits in some Viking war, I was really bad at history, and how they played a role in pillaging. And if you give them a textbook that's up to date with real information, or you give them sources that they can cite immediately, you're going to get better content and you're going to get relevant content.

[00:11:12.700] - Speaker 1
The problem is, with AI of any sort, they have too much to pull from. If you're not specific, they can't help you. But AI is not the be all and end all. We cannot rely on AI to do all the work for us. Yes, it'd be lovely to, I don't know, spend $1,000 a year and suddenly get this amazing built-for-you blog that ranks perfectly.

[00:11:36.330] - Speaker 1
But if it was that easy, we'd all do it, and then no one could rank anymore because we'd be all oversaturated. So SEO and AI can't work together. Google will rank AI content. In fact, ironically, Google uses AI to determine what is AI content. Google uses AI for most of what they do because there's billions of searches every day.

[00:12:02.440] - Speaker 1
They do not have the manpower to go in and manually check everything. And so why should you be expected to have the manpower to single handedly start your blogging empire? So I wanted to prove that AI content ranks and that SEO works with AI. So on my main travel site over here, we have my fifth most popular post this last month, brought in 2400 page views in that month. This was completely generated with AI content. I did not write this post singlehandedly at all. I wrote this with Jasper. Then down here, we have a niche site that I started as an experiment.

[00:12:47.910] - Speaker 1
It has about 21 posts on it at the moment, and it gets 3333 page views a month. It's only a few months old, and the fact that it's already ranking this well, I've built maybe three backlinks to it from 20 posts is very exciting. And typically, people don't see results like this, especially if they're not using an AI writer.

[00:13:11.650] - Speaker 1
So, fun fact, on average, it takes 100 to 140 posts to get into Mediavine, and for travel, it's about 160. So this is taken, like, where these numbers come from. I did an informal survey once I got into Mediavine. I asked everyone I knew, how many posts did it take you? And inside the Mediabine Group, I also asked them questions about this.

[00:13:34.680] - Speaker 1
And so as we think about a typical blogger who writes one post per week, maybe at best, for a while there, I was only able to write one post every other week, but let's say, one post per week. To get into Mediavine, it would likely take you three years. And I don't know about you, but I don't have three years to wait. So I want to know in the comments, do you feel okay waiting three years? Do you have three years to wait to live your blogging dreams?

[00:14:06.550] - Speaker 1
Okay. This is Jasper. AI. We are in the writing interface right now in boss mode. So I want to talk a bit about SEO best practices with Jasper.

[00:14:16.830] - Speaker 1
So we could go on for hours about this, but these are some quick and easy things that you can do to ensure that anything you write with Jasper is high quality and rankable. So in this area, I have like a very basic version of an outline. I did not do a full outline. But let's say our blog post, the keyword is things to do in Rome, you're going to come in here and you are going to bring in a full SEO-optimized outline. You are going to look at competitors to see how many things do they have in their list.

[00:14:49.990] - Speaker 1
You're going to create that list of things for things to do post. This works the same for how-to-do things and even recipe posts. Jasper can be used for literally everything under the sun, which is amazing. But in here, you can actually write a post with Jasper very easily with these little techniques. So I also recommend adding a tone of voice to make sure it sounds like you, but not super necessary.

[00:15:19.230] - Speaker 1
Now, for SEO best practices, you want to have an introduction for every blog post. Within the first hundred words, you want to use your keyword. Jasper isn't trained in SEO, it's pretty good at it, to be honest. But you have to put in some work yourself. So the ways that we can trigger Jasper to use our keywords are number one, by having it in our title.

[00:15:40.820] - Speaker 1
So I have made this in H1, that way Jasper can say hey that's the H one, that's the title, we're set. I also put it in the title description over here on the side. Jasper pulls from all of the information over on this side while he's writing. Then we have the content description and brief. You don't really need that for the intro, we'll talk about it in a moment.

[00:16:04.600] - Speaker 1
But here if you wanted to, let say if you're writing this post for things to do in Rome but your blog is all about child friendly things, you might want to, number one, probably target that as the keyword instead. But you can tell Jasper in the content description to write an article about things to in Rome that it's child friendly, or focus on the solo travelers, or the family, focus on whatever travelers you're focusing on there, and choose your audience and tell him who they are. Then you can also add in keywords. I actually caution against doing this which I think is a bit again, controversial. I prefer to trigger my keywords inside of Jasper and our writing through the content brief, through headers from my H One to my H two, you can go down to H four.

[00:16:53.250] - Speaker 1
So even your FAQ section, you can fully set up this way. But I find when you put keywords into the keyword area, sometimes he will keyword stuff a bit. And we don't want anything that has too many keywords. That is definitely a pitfall people get into with AI writers is they trust the AI writer knows better than they do and that is never the case. You are the brains behind the operation. Jasper is just your conduit to getting it written a bit better.

[00:17:24.550] - Speaker 1
So from here to start, we can say write a blog post introduction on things to do in Rome. You don't need to capitalize anything, he'll figure it out. You can even add in more like if I do, this is a blog post for family travelers, I can't type and talk at the same time but then I would have him run this. So, to run, you hit command enter or command J.

[00:17:59.020] - Speaker 1
These are two different commands, but basically, I'm just going to run a simple one for now. We're just going to run and write a blog post introduction on things to do in Rome, command enter and we'll let him run. So here we go, we've got a quick and easy little intro. I teach more about how to get like intros that are more your style in my other courses which we'll talk about it later, but this is basically a nice little intro to get you going. So here we can see that he does use our keywords kind of bits and pieces of it and not altogether.

[00:18:35.500] - Speaker 1
So what I do in this case is I write with Jasper and I think that's kind of the thing people don't think to do, they want Jasper to do all the work. So I would say here are the 31 things to do in Rome, because I know that I need to have that full keyword together to rank on Google. And then you would just keep going. You can just have him start writing about the Travis Fountain if you want because it's quite a popular place. However, it's better to give him information.

[00:19:08.050] - Speaker 1
So this is where I would feed him keywords in my content description. I would give him information, I would say, one, visit the Travis Fountain. Fountain, how do I spell fountain?

[00:19:21.420] - Speaker 1
There we go. I would just list things about it like free to visit, kids will love this, whatever. You can add in any of those triggers here to get him thinking about what you want this focus to be, what you want the keywords built-in to be. And when you do this, Jasper actually reads and pulls that information in. So that makes it a lot simpler for him to basically put all this together and create an easy-to-read post that includes all the keywords that you need.

[00:19:59.070] - Speaker 1
So the reason we don't let Jasper just create an outline, if I say sorry, there we go, write a blog post outline. Jasper has read a number of things on the internet and so, he will pull information for you. However, he has read, like he's kind of up to date, he's not fully up to date, but for things like Rome, there's a lot of touristy things out there. And so, he's going to pull what the top ten probably had when he read the internet. But those might be things that are very kind of overdone.

[00:20:33.390] - Speaker 1
So for example, he has to Coliseum, Vatican City, that's great. But if you're like actually, I hate those things. I'm a local, I know that those are bad. Then you have to input your own information. Another pitfall with SEO and AI writers and honestly, any kind of AI content generator is it's pulling from what already exists on the top ten of Google.

[00:20:56.830] - Speaker 1
And so if those are bad, if they have poor information, misinformation, then where do you go from there? You're kind of stuck. So what you need to do is to create this SEO-optimized outline, so you can guide him so that you have better information. And then all he has to do is fill in the blanks, kind of write in the bits and pieces in between. This is the same for if you're trying to write anything that's very factual.

[00:21:24.090] - Speaker 1
A lot of people try to get Jasper to come up with facts. That's not his job. He is not your researcher. He is your writer. And this is something I've seen as well with Rank IQ and surfer SEO is that even the words they recommend, the word count that they tell you, it's very much based on what already exists and it doesn't evaluate what exists.

[00:21:45.810] - Speaker 1
Tell you if they're worth imitating. I don't want to write a blog post. It's the same as the top ten. If the top ten is always really thin content, or perhaps is very outdated, or if forums are ranking, because first of all, a forum will drastically stew how long the post should be, for example. As well, if like TripAdvisor is ranking, their word count is much, much lower than ours will be.

[00:22:12.060] - Speaker 1
And so we have to add in more words. But those AI generators don't take that into account. That's why I say we are the brains behind the operation. We have to put this together ourselves. And then these are just ways to kind of create little shortcuts that speed up our writing.

[00:22:30.930] - Speaker 1
With Jasper, I am able to do a hundred thousand words a week, and I was doing that while I was at my full-time job at a law firm as well as being an SEO specialist and a content freelance writer for other people and dealing with some dog training stuff all at the same time. So I had no time to work, and I was able to write literally hundreds of posts with Jasper, and you can too. And when I say that he writes anything, he will write any type of content. Then once you are done working with Jasper, I do recommend as you go, edit as you go.

[00:23:09.420] - Speaker 1
Because if you let him do nonsense for number one, he's going to kind of, he sees the patterns above and he's going to kind of copy those as he goes. So it's best to edit as you go, include those keywords as you go, and then you can literally copy and paste all of this straight into your WordPress dashboard and it will keep all the formatting. But then you want to use SEO best practices on your own site to ensure that this ranks. So how do we do that? We're going to add a meta description.

[00:23:40.080] - Speaker 1
We're going to make sure our title is SEO-Optimized. So that means it's about 55 characters long, usually about eleven words, and that it has something that encourages people to click. We also want to make sure we have image alt tech, alt text, pardon me, for every single image. We do want to add images, maybe even some multimedia, like videos. And then overall, you want to make sure that this content is superior content that you have offered better than what anyone else has.

[00:24:10.890] - Speaker 1
So that's sometimes called skyscraper content, sometimes it's called eat any, whatever you want to call it. You want to be the be all and end all for this keyword. You want someone to be like, oh my God, that meatball recipe answered all my questions, is the best meatball recipe. You don't want to be just another meatball recipe next to Epicurious because you're not going to rank and you're not going to inspire people to become raving fans of your site.

[00:24:40.600] - Speaker 1
So offering that high-quality content that answers every single question, and to be honest, I used Jasper for this. My FAQs are very, very long and they are entirely written by Jasper. So really finding ways to make sure that you know your principles for SEO and then you're just using Jasper to fill in the in between. He can even write those alt text and that meta description, but you have to double check him, just like I did in the intro here.

[00:25:09.100] - Speaker 1
Let's review what we just went over. When you're writing with an AI content writer, you need to do your own SEO research. So you have to find your keywords and you have to make an SEO outline. There's so many different tools out there to help teach you how to do this, but I recommend using key search. It's very affordable.

[00:25:27.170] - Speaker 1
If you aren't making money on your blog yet, you don't need to invest hundreds of dollars into Ahrefs, although I will say it's my favorite SEO tool. Then when you're writing with this AI, you want to edit as you go to make sure that he doesn't start kind of building on bad patterns. It's kind of like with my dog Theo, if I didn't train him to stop peeing in the house, then he would have thought, okay, peeing in the house is okay. So, peeing like, at PetSmart is okay too, peeing at my mom's house is okay.

[00:25:58.020] - Speaker 1
You need to have a good foundation or else he's going to start making those errors throughout the post. And then you want to use proper SEO on your site. So I went through some of those different things that you need to do but essentially it is basic SEO that you can learn even like just by reading the little Yoast and Rank Math toggles essentially, although they are not the be all and end all, promise that. But they'll help give you some guidance on these to make sure that you can be rankable. And then ultimately it is just creating the best content out there.

[00:26:32.500] - Speaker 1
You want to be an SEO superstar, no matter what type of content you're writing, and Jasper will help you do that. Jasper really does speed up that writing process. So we're not waiting three years to be a success because I waited five, and I can tell you it sucks. You don't want to do that. You want to see success as soon as possible, and this is the way to do it.

[00:26:55.800] - Speaker 1
And I'm all for content writers, but they're very expensive. Jasper's plan start at $50 for 50,000 words a month. I pay my content writers $50 for a thousand words, and even then, I often find that Jasper does a better job. So keep that in mind. And really remember, to scale a business like a blog, you do need to invest and find ways to, yeah, kind of even the playing field.

[00:27:25.750] - Speaker 1
If anyone has any questions, please pop them in the chat, and I will be in there to answer all of them. Questions about Jasper, questions about SEO, I love both of these things dearly. If you go to sheknowsseo.co, you will see just how much I love both of them because they are all over the place.

[00:27:47.150] - Speaker 1
Now to go further with Jasper, you do have to learn how to use it the right way. I know a lot of people who bail on it pretty early, and they say, oh, the content is bad, or I'm not getting the outputs I want. And I want to help you love this tool as much as I do. So I've created a free ebook for y'all that's called The Best Jasper AI commands for Bloggers.

[00:28:08.800] - Speaker 1
Not the most creative title, I don't care, it tells you what it is. So in this little ebook, it's about twelve pages. That'll help you learn how to make the most of Jasper AI.

[00:28:19.110] - Speaker 1
It's the leading AI. Writer on the market. And in here, you'll learn how to use commands for email marketing, writing blog posts, rewriting blog posts, for content audits, or if you're like me, and you had blog posts that literally said, hey, mom, I'm safe in Singapore. We want to get rid of those. We'll also go through how to create quizzes and digital products with Jasper, so that you can make the money that you spend on your subscription to it back super fast.

[00:28:49.330] - Speaker 1
So thank you so much for joining me. This has been so fun. And I appreciate getting to talk about Jasper, because, honestly, my therapist told me I had to stop telling her about Jasper and Google Analytics. So I appreciate any opportunity to talk to anybody about this. And I really, really hope that you take this opportunity to use a tool that does even the playing field versus the big names that can afford to have full content writing team. Turn yourself and Jasper into a content writing team.

[00:29:21.280] - Speaker 1
It's really, really fun. Yeah. And I'm just really grateful that you took the time to be here and to invest in yourself and your blog and your education. I truly think that learning and investing in knowledge is the best way to grow. So have an epic time at the summit.

[00:29:39.420] - Speaker 1
And it was so lovely to chat with you. Bye.

**Transcript:**
[00:00:03.650] - Nina Clapperton
Hey, everybody. My name is Nina Clapperton, and I'm here to teach you about my trending article formula to get you 1,000 clicks in a day from Google. Now, who am I? If you don't know me, hi, my name is Nina. I'm the founder of sheknowseo.co, which is an SEO company that helps bloggers like you rank on Google. I'm Canadian, so you might hear some abouts and some stories, and you'll see my puppy Theo throughout. He's a lot cuter than any of the screenshots I take, so I'm including him to keep your attention. Now, I am obsessed with SEO and AI. I am honestly addicted to it. And because of that, I use my knowledge, my skills, and my hyper fixations to make sure that you are growing your business and ranking on Google. Now, I like to show you immediately that I know what I'm talking about. Now, Now, back in May of 2024, the Google algorithm leaked and I wrote an article that went viral. It got over, I think it was over 26,000. It was on the screen. It got over 26,000 clicks in that month. It also made me almost $1,000 just in ad revenue, and then honestly, far, far more when it came from affiliates and products down the line.

[00:01:21.320] - Nina Clapperton
So this is the article. It's the Google algorithm leak. You can see here it got 26,780 clicks in the 30-day period. That was from May 27th to June 27th. And then my Raptive earnings, you can see here, I made $821 in ad revenue, and that's not including affiliate links, the digital products I went on to sell, and the multiple sponsored deals I got out of it. I would say this article paid for itself 5,000 times over, especially since it didn't cost me anything to write. So highly recommend. And this isn't just a flash in the pan. I've done it again. So before I did this training, I wanted to make sure that you all could see a more recent example since I know that Google's algorithm has been changing a lot. This is the exact same site. I wrote an article about a new AI tool, and it took off, and I got a thousand clicks in a single day. Now, the best part of this is this is not a good SEO post otherwise. It has no backlinks. I forgot to add any internal links to either of these. I made a lot of mistakes with the setup of them.

[00:02:25.390] - Nina Clapperton
The keyword didn't technically exist yet because it was a new topic. Technically, everything I did was anti-SEO. There was no volume, there was no competitor analysis done, none of that fancy keyword research stuff, which I do also love, but I think there's a time and a place to break some rules. You're probably like, What the heck is that? How did you do it? Is it magic? No. It's my trending topic formula. I have repeated this on a number of sites. I have over 12 niche sites that I run now. I have done it on everything from to dogs, to recipes, to construction, to travel. It literally works no matter the niche that you're in, and that's what makes it so cool. So I have the steps that we're going to go through here together. Step one, we're going to find the topics because you're not a journalist. You don't need to go out and hunt this down. Step two, we're going to do our own research and analysis to add our own flair to it. Then step three, we are going to add something new to the conversation. We're going to go a step further.

[00:03:26.610] - Nina Clapperton
Step four, we're going to write an epic article, and I'll tell you exactly what that and what it should be in that article. Step five, we are going to turn our visitors into fans. As you notice from my screenshots, this is something that brings a lot of traffic, but it's for a short period, and we want to make sure we are keeping that audience. So I'm going to show you how I was able to get this article into... I don't even know. Honestly, I didn't have good tracking set up, but my email list grew by a couple thousand people pretty quickly around that period. So I can safely say at least bare minimum, 500 people came from that article. I suspect it was a lot more. Then we have step six, which is to share it everywhere. And I'm going to help you repurpose your content to other places with an automated system I have set up. And then lastly, we are going to fully repurpose it, not just quoting it. We are going to recreate new things around it to keep this traction going. So I do want to give some caveats to begin with because a strategy like this can turn into fool's gold very quickly if you are doing some things wrong with it.

[00:04:30.690] - Nina Clapperton
So number one, there are no guarantees here. The first thing people always ask me is, how can I be sure if it's a trending topic? You can't. You have no idea. Just like with something going viral on TikTok or Instagram, what goes viral, quote unquote, with this, and this isn't really a virality thing, it's going to depend. And so I have written a lot of articles that didn't take off, and then I've written some that did take off. Now, taking off also varies. It's not always going to be 30,000 clicks in a month. It might be that it gets you 500 clicks. It might be that it gets you 50. It really depends on the post, how popular it is, how big your niche is, and ultimately, some of it's luck. So I'm going to teach you the steps to make this possible, but I cannot guarantee that every single article is going to kick off. At this point, when I publish these articles, I have an over 50 % success rate. I haven't done perfect math on it, but roughly, I can say in the last four months, it has been over 75%.

[00:05:32.660] - Nina Clapperton
But a lot of that has come from repetition and writing a lot of posts that didn't do that well. Now, the next thing is, don't like engagement bait. Don't just be posting about any news source. You are not like CNN. You are not like as some news network. You are a blogger. That is very different. So you're not going to be out here like breaking news journalism for the first time. And you're also not trying to report on everything. We want to choose things that are specific to our audience and to our niche. That way, even if it didn't take off, it would still be relevant to them. So it can still live on your site and it won't look bizarre. And then lastly, quality is key. I see a lot of people see me have success with this and then go, Oh, I'm going to do the same, but I'm going to publish a 200-word article and I'll do a thousand of them. No, that's not the point of this. I think that this is a great strategy to grow your business, and you could definitely be doing it more often. I would say absolute maximum once a week because partially, you need to give your audience a cool down period in between.

[00:06:36.720] - Nina Clapperton
But also these articles take time to write. They are not like a quick, I don't know, tell ChatGPT, write a trending article about Moo Deng or something or about Chappell Roan, you need to actually go in and add more to this. So quality is going to matter so much. So first one, we are going to find trending topics together. So how do we find these trending topics? Well, the first thing you're going to need is a clearly defined niche. You just need to know what you're working with. So let's say we're working with dogs. We're using the example of my dog throughout this. So here's Theo. He's on a hotel bed with me when we were working as we were traveling. He wants to look for some trending topics around dog content, maybe dog travel because he's in a bed. I need to know who I'm speaking to. If my audience have a Chihuahua versus a large dog, it's very different. If they're located in Asia versus in the US, also quite different. So I need to know that. And now to find those trending topics, the easiest thing is to live in your niche. And what I mean by that is just actually enjoy the content and be on TikTok and have it be something your algorithm naturally feeds you.

[00:07:45.080] - Nina Clapperton
Be on Twitter, have it be something that algorithm naturally feeds you. So already have a passion for this subject. And I totally get you want to turn it off when you're off work hours, that's fine. But you do want to be living in the niche, hearing what's going on and having the news come to you long term. So here's where I find topics. I'll move my little head. The first is Google Trends. Now, Pinterest Trends is also a good one, but they're basically the same from what I've seen. So I use Google Trends. Now, you can also use it via Key Search. Key Search, you can get 30% off with code She Know's SEO if you want it. But they actually have a Google Trends feature as well as a Twitter Trends feature so that you can actually do it all from inside of Key Search, which is nice. But I will use Google and I'll see what's trending. Twitter, just being on Twitter and seeing what people post about, that's how I found out about the Google algorithm leak. I've been to conferences before and heard about things that I was like, Oh, I should look into that.

[00:08:42.770] - Nina Clapperton
Going on general news sites, signing up to any press release that's really big in the cruise world is being on press releases. If you do anything with like lodging or hotels, hotels have PR. There are so many different things you can get on there. Any industry-specific news sources. Tiktok, love TikTok for it. You can get on the ground journalism really, really fast, and it's very easy to train the algorithm to show you that. Then Exploding Topics. It's a paid site, but I just get their free email. And so once a week, they send you a few topics that are exploding or taking off. And so those are things that recently have had a ton of traffic. So they had things like hair gummies when those first came out. They had ChatGPT when it first hit. So I've been on their list for a while, as you can tell. But that's a really great way to get a couple delivered to your email. They do have a paid one, but I can't speak to it. And then lastly, your own communities. I'm a big fan of having a Facebook group or some exclusive community for your audience.

[00:09:41.660] - Nina Clapperton
And that can be a great place where people, again, bring it to you. Now, number two is to do your own research and analysis. So when we're doing this, we don't just want to be parroting what anyone else has said. You're not a parrot. You are your own person. You have your own opinions and thoughts. And your audience wants to hear from you. So they want you to do the critical analysis and research for them. So let's say that we found out that Bark Air opened. They did back in 2024. Let's say they've announced a new route from Toronto to Australia. I don't know. So with that, I'm like, Okay, now I've heard that news is happening, but I want to look into this. Maybe I want to compare it to what other options are available. Maybe I want to speak to some people who actually flew with them already if they've done an inaugural flight or for any of their other flights. Maybe I want to compare the quality of the plane that they're flying versus other ones. There have been some lawsuits in that niche. So all of that is extra context I can add to this to help my audience decide if this is something that solves their pain points.

[00:10:44.620] - Nina Clapperton
So I want you to think about, Okay, what is it that I can bring my expertise to? What are some other questions people might have? How can I add to this conversation? And please, please, please do not just read an analysis of an analysis of an analysis of a summary of an analysis. Go to the original source as best you can to try and actually get the information. And then with that as well, if you're not an expert for anything dog-related, I am not a vet or a trainer, I can go out and seek expert sources and get their comments and opinions on it. Think about how many people do those people on the street interviews with the little baby mics right now. Those are really common because they're getting opinions from real human beings on the subject. You can also compare and contrast some stats that you can find online. Most things are available out there for free. You can get a lot of Freedom of Information Act reports, but most people just put their statistics up. In Canada, we have Statistics Canada. You can find so much there. We always, always, always, sorry, I already said this earlier, but that's how important it is.

[00:11:47.130] - Nina Clapperton
Read the original. You don't want to misquote something. You don't want to misrepresent something. And also, I find by reading the original, you're likely to think like your ideal audience. When I was reading the Google algorithm leak documents, there were over 14,000 algorithm elements leaked. It was so boring. And as I was reading it, I was like, wow, my audience does not care about this. They just want to know what if this matters to them? What if this will actually affect their lives? And so that leads us to steps Three, add something new. Now, when you're adding something new, basically the easiest way to think of it is to ask yourself, so what? Why does my audience need to know this? If I explain to them that this thing happened and they said, so what? How would How would I answer them? How would I say that this is why it matters to you? And the best way to think of that, the easiest thing, is to figure out their main pain point. You can even ask ChatGPT this, Hey, my audience is this type of person. This is their primary pain point. I want to write an article on this thing that's happening right now.

[00:12:47.990] - Nina Clapperton
How can I write it and address it towards their pain point? Easy peasy. There could be a few different ways that this happens. It might be that you're taking complex text speak and turning it into English. You could be creating action steps. For that algorithm leak, I did both. I said what to do next. Here's what it means for bloggers. I actually outranked all the people who did the leaking, which was partially a Google thing. But the reason that I was able to do that is because I went a step further. I added something new, and I think the amount of people parroting the original actually made the original look like spam, unfortunately. And you don't want to get caught up in that. It looks like duplicate content. Then you can add in personal experience. You compare it with the past experience you had, bring in some new discussion point. How many times have we seen Instagram and TikTok videos where it's like, I haven't seen anyone talking about this yet. It's a good hook for a reason. You can do long term analysis of how something has played out over time. You can compare and contrast that, or you can predict the future and think about what that's going to do for you next.

[00:13:51.840] - Nina Clapperton
Now we need to write that epic article. First rule, don't write like BuzzFeed. Buzzfeed is great for quizzes. They are not great for content, and they are a news site. They are like an entertainment news site. We need an actual helpful article because our goal is that if someone is visiting us for this, we're representing our brand so they know what they're going to get if they stick around. If this is like very thin content, that's what they're going to expect from the rest of your site. And they're likely not going to stick around because they're not going to give you that chance to figure out that you actually write great stuff. Here's what a quality article includes to me. Number one, an introduction to the topic. This is new. This is trending trending. They don't know what this trend is. You have to explain it. You also need to clearly say why you are the person to talk about it. These people largely will not know you yet. This is basically meant to reach a new audience. So we need to intro ourselves. Pitch yourself in one to two sentences. I'm Nina. I've had articles that have hit 30,000 page views in 35 days and made me a $1,000 in ad revenue or whatever.

[00:14:55.610] - Nina Clapperton
That's going to convince someone to read my article about that thing. So we want to have You also want to speak to your target audience. So again, we're writing for our niche. But when I'm talking about Bark Air, I'm not going to talk about it for Chihuahua's if I have my beautiful, lovely, giant ass golden retriever over here. I'm going to talk about it in the sphere of large dog travel because he's huge. So I don't have the audience who would want the other thing. They're typically long form. So over a thousand words. I'd say my shortest I've ever managed to have work was 800, but it does depend on the topic for sure. However, the fact that you're adding something new should immediately make it very easy to get to a thousand words. Get to the point. Cut the fluff. I spend a long time cutting the fluff out of my articles and getting straight to the point. Here's exactly what you need to know, especially because this is a trend that's going to likely grow, and then you have to compete with the people who come later. You need to tell them why this matters to them and what to do.

[00:15:53.890] - Nina Clapperton
Action is very much key. People don't want to just be told, Here's how to add one plus one. They're like, Okay, When, why, how? Exactly walk me through it. Let's have real life. They want all the extra details. Then it's going to conclude. Don't leave them with SEO blue balls where it's like you just end, leave them hanging halfway through an article. I have seen it so many times. Instead, finish the post and then tell them a little bit more. So add on a relevant strategy that they can do with this information. Have a next step, something that they should read. Have some way that this article connects to the larger idea of your and your niche and plant some seeds about why they would need you in their life. And then we want to turn those visitors into fans. So these are some ways I keep people coming back for more with my articles. I have an email list often in every single one, and especially in these ones. In these ones, I add it 2-3 times, bare minimum. Then you can have them come to your community to ask questions. So I always say, Hey, join my Facebook group to ask questions.

[00:16:56.200] - Nina Clapperton
It's because I'm really bad at email, but it's helped grow my Facebook group. You could create a hashtag on social media that they can share things to. Let's say it's this bark-air thing. Maybe you want to have people share photos of their dogs flying. That'd be very cute. You can promote a low-ticket offer inside the piece. I don't recommend going to be having high ticket just because these people don't know you yet. You need to bring them into your sphere and having a very low barrier to entry is better. You're going to add internal links to other content on your site, and you could even invite them to a limited time live webinar or live event. And then we're going to share this everywhere. So the Google algorithm leak actually revealed to us that Google cares about clicks from social media from other places. On Chrome, they're tracking how people move through the web. So they want to know that people are getting to you, not just through Google. Google is a popular girl. Once you get other people talking about you, then she'll care about you. So we want to try and get some social clicks.

[00:17:53.790] - Nina Clapperton
Newsletter is a huge one for that. Social media is also good. Really, whatever you can do to make you seem more desirable is going to make Google desire you more. So where can you share this? I'm going to move my head because it's in front of the QR code, but you can share it to any of your social media accounts. On Instagram, I use many chat to share my algorithm leak article, and that did really well. Well, really well for me. I don't have a good Instagram, but the biggest thing for me was emailing it to my list. That got about a thousand clicks, and that really triggered everything else to go off. Now, for how to share these in an easy and automated way, I have a Zapier connection section that I set up with the OpenAI API, which is like pennies. It's not expensive. And here's a tutorial on exactly how to do that. It's a free tutorial. Go watch it. It'll show you exactly the way to set this up. So it runs on autopilot. And then lastly, we need to repurpose our content. So when you're creating this content, you want to make sure that you are thinking about how to make the most of it.

[00:18:52.180] - Nina Clapperton
So the first thing to consider is, can you put this trend on another platform? These trending topics aren't a TikTok trend like GirlMath something, which even then, honestly, spilled over everywhere. But this is information that's new to all of these platforms. So I also recorded a video that was me rambling, to be honest. It was too long, but about the Google algorithm leak and a couple of little extra details I hadn't been able to fit in the article. I was also able to interact with my audience about it so I could answer some questions. It got 1,200 views. Now, my YouTube is not massive, so that's really big for something that I had streamed five days ago the time I took this. It usually takes a long time for my stuff to take off because I SEO it, I don't YouTube it. So turn your content into a video, a podcast, a live webinar. Clip it for social media. There are so many things you can do to keep them coming back or join you in other spaces. You can even turn this into a series. With the Google algorithm leak, people were unveiling five things a day for months about, Oh, now we've discovered this.

[00:19:55.670] - Nina Clapperton
So just keep juicing that lime until it's fully run dry. Now, I have a challenge for you. I am one of those teachers that likes to give homework, but it's very easy homework. Theo and I want you to write a trending topic this week. We want you to follow the seven easy steps, and then I want you to let me know how it goes. And if you tag me in it this week or next, I'll give you two weeks, I will be one of your social clicks. So share it @NinaClapperton on basically every social platform, and I will find it, I will click, and I will make sure to help that algorithm trigger that it should look at your article. So remember, though, they won't all be winners. So you might need to do this a couple of times. And that's okay. It's going to help you get to know your audience and help them learn that you are staying on the pulse in this industry. And honestly, they're going to trust you more for it. But how would you like to see your blog reaching these heights consistently? Because 1,000 clicks a day is nice, but it's not going to get you into an ad network.

[00:20:52.160] - Nina Clapperton
It's not going to make you consistent money. Well, you can do it the hard way. You can spend five years working hard, have no income. You can jump from TikTok to Pinterest to SEO to Instagram and back. You could wait six months for your articles to rank on Google. You could spend over $12,000 on blogging courses. And honestly, I think at this point, I'm well into $30k now. It's become a problem. But now they're for fun. But on courses that still don't get you results. And those first $12K, they didn't. You could spend more time at webinars and summits, but you can spend more time at webinars and summits and master classes and have nothing to show for it because you haven't actually written anything. Or you can do things the easy way and join me in 6 Months to 50K. This is my 6 Months to 50K sessions masterclass. It's going to show you the exact steps I take to grow to 50,000 sessions and get into Mediavine with a new site. Now, this also includes site setup. So there is a bonus month of setting up your website with tech and getting your tech all sorted.

[00:21:55.300] - Nina Clapperton
I'll teach you my batchwork system to produce content more productively. Getting too excited. And you'll get two recorded blog audits that I did for past students that show you exactly how to structure your site and write posts that rank while showing you what not to do, because I think that that's a very helpful visual. Now, for the next two weeks, you can get this for 50 % off, but this is limited time. You can use the QR code on screen. You can go to the link on the side. It's going to auto-apply the coupon. If either of them glitch for some reason, it is BBS for Blogger Breakthrough Summit, 25. And you will be able to get 50 % off. Let's talk about what's actually inside of it, though. You're going to get that month zero. You're going to learn how to define your niche and audit your site. You'll figure out how to do keyword research the right way, how to write posts that actually rank and that people want to read, how to get back links without buying them, how to intentionally internal link to keep people on your site and turn them really into best friends.

[00:22:54.930] - Nina Clapperton
And then my zero to hero keyword strategy that is a very underrated method to to grow your blog by going for these special types of keywords that I grew by over 10,000 page views in a month from them. Then we'll talk about how to track your success with some tracking tools, and you'll get a Q&A from the original launch of the course. Plus, you'll get implementation things to help you along the way, including some checklists. These are some things that past students have said. Feel free to pause to read if you would like to. You can also find even more in my SEO for Travel Bloggers Facebook group if you search the term 50K. That's a value of 2,950 bucks for only $149. I think it's actually $148.50, but it wouldn't fit in my sticker. Thank you so much for having me. Theo is asleep in the corner, but I'm sure he thanks you for being here, too. If you want to keep up with me, you can find me at sheknowseo.Co, where I share a weekly newsletter of SEO and AI tips to help bloggers grow their income. You can find me @sheknowsseo on YouTube, where I have tons of helpful tutorials like this one.

[00:23:58.410] - Nina Clapperton
You can follow me @NinaClapperton on basically every social platform otherwise. And you can find me at SEO for Travel Bloggers, my free Facebook group. Although you don't need to be a travel blogger to join, and one day I'll eventually change that. So you can also get that 6 months of 50K Masterclass for 50% off. And if you have any questions, please drop them in wherever the chat is around this, and I'll be happy to help. Thank you so much for being here, and I hope you have a lovely rest of your day. Enjoy the summit. Bye.

**Transcript:**
[00:00:12.080] - Nina Clapperton
Hey everybody, my name is Nina Clapperton, and I am the founder of ""She Knows SEO."" I'm here at the Blogger Breakthrough Summit to teach you all about how to rank on Google with AI content and I'm super excited to dive in.

[00:00:24.000] - Nina
But who the heck am I? Why am I someone to listen to? Well, my name is Nina. I am an SEO specialist, an AI expert, and a multi-six-figure travel blogger. I'm the founder of sheknowsseo.co, where you can find helpful AI and SEO tips. I'm Canadian, so you'll probably hear me say sorry at some point, probably for my beloved Golden Retriever, Theo, barking at some random thing he saw outside. He's really worried about leaves blowing in the wind lately, which is unhelpful.

[00:00:53.330] - Nina
I'm a travel addict and got my start as a travel blogger, blogging about living in over 12 countries in the last 10 years. And I am so obsessed with SEO and AI. I really want everyone to be able to achieve financial freedom with a blog or any online business, because I really believe in democratizing entrepreneurship and not just leaving it up for those tech bros. We should all be able to do this, and we can.

[00:01:17.980] - Nina
But I love to start with a game. So we're going to do ""Two Truths, One Lie,"" which is one of my favorite party games. So my head's blocking the number, but it's three little options here. So if you guys can just pop in the chat which one you think is the lie? So number one, I've been using AI since 2021. Number two, I've coded eight plugins with ChatGPT. Number three, I have written over 500 articles with AI. So, just pop the number in the chat, I want to see what you all think is the lie. And don't worry, I'll reveal it in just a moment.

[00:01:51.870] - Nina
Okay, it's just one number, so that should have been enough time and you could have written it while I was talking, so hopefully we're good. So which one is the lie? It's number three. I have only written 300 articles with AI, but I have been using it since 2021, back when everyone said that using AI was akin to kicking a puppy or something. It was horrible. People were really mean about it. But I started using AI in October of 2021, and I have had tons of success since then. It has always worked. I've also coded eight plugins because ChatGPT can do some coding. But we'll talk about that a little bit later. But yeah, I've only written 300 articles because then I started teaching a lot more and I haven't had as much time to write them.

[00:02:31.720] - Nina
So, I want to show some proof that this actually works. AI does rank. In 2021, I found Jasper AI, started writing AI content. I was working four jobs at the time, including working as a law clerk at a law firm. I never say 'firm' right the first time. Clearly, I hate it. It was the reason I left that job. But I was working four jobs and trying to write for my blog and I just didn't have time. So I started using the AI and within six months I got into Mediavine. I went from 5,000 sessions to about 55,000 sessions very, very quickly. So here you can see that in one month I grew by 14,500 sessions with 10 blog posts. That was 10 new blog posts that month. There were some before, for sure. There's backlink building. There's a lot that went into this. But AI really drove the ship, because I could not have written 10 posts in a month if I didn't have AI to help me at that time.

[00:03:25.310] - Nina
I was too busy with the millions of other things I had going on. And this was back when Google still said, ""We don't rank AI content."" It's only in early 2023 that they finally admitted, ""Yeah, actually, maybe we do."" But that was a long time ago, so I want to show you guys something more recent. Now, summer is my peak period. I'll be 100% honest. This is a top-level page views for me. But I had 236,000 page views. I used to like happy dance at 10,000 page views. Now I'm way above that. I mean, holy crap, it still surprises me. So this was in August of 2023, but 100% seasonality happens. I write about Canada. No one wants to come here in winter. Fair. I don't really want to be here in winter sometimes. And so in winter, my traffic does drop to about 150,000 so far. Not the greatest, but it happens.

[00:04:26.030] - Nina
Now before we start, please turn off your phones, close your other tabs, get rid of distractions. It's all about me. No, honestly, it's not. It's about you guys learning. And I want to make sure that you guys can focus on this. I am known for shoving a ton of information at people, so I really want you guys to be able to listen.

[00:04:43.450] - Nina
Now, I'm neurodivergent. I have ADHD, so I do understand it is hard to focus on one thing. I try to be quite engaging for you all, but if you need something else to do, pick something that's not really distracting, maybe like a fidget spinner or something to just help you guys focus. Or pet a puppy. I find that helps with my dog.

[00:05:02.780] - Nina
Now, what are we going to talk about today? Number one, how to use AI for blogging. Number two, does Google even rank AI content? Number three, SEO best practices with AI. Number four, unique use cases for AI. So we're not just going to be talking about writing posts, there's so much more you can do with AI.

[00:05:20.800] - Nina
So let's dive in. Now, what is AI content? AI content is anything not generated by a human being, basically. It's anything that is automatically generated by artificial intelligence, AI. Now that doesn't just mean that it is AI writers.

[00:05:40.470] - Nina
There's so many types of AI in the world. Technically, a calculator is AI. And I do often connect AI writers to calculators in the same way, so that's going to come back. But let's talk about different types of AI content on blogs, because there are a number of them, and you are probably using them long before you actually knew you were using AI. I was. I had no idea. So using something like Rank Math or Yoast, that's AI. Even before they added their AI tool. I realize they've done that now and they've completely messed up my example. But before that, when they would just track the number of times that you use the keyword on the page, that was AI.

[00:06:19.890] - Nina
Now something like KeySearch or Ahrefs or Semrush, whatever keyword research tool, using AI. Using an API from Google AdWords, that they then put through artificial intelligence to create data for you. All a type of AI. And then, of course, there are AI writers. Those are the newer thing. It was vilified for a while. I remember reading this awful, really poorly written article about the dangers of AI and how someone tried to use Bing's AI, I think, or maybe Bard or something, they taught it about shadow cells. And then it got really dark and twisty. And I was like, yeah, because you taught that, and you didn't clear the memory. So when you switched to other stuff, it didn't stop. It was really weird and fear-mongering.

[00:07:07.590] - Nina
AI is not trying to kill us, guys. It is like a calculator. It's just trying to move things forward a bit. It cannot genuinely think for itself yet. I don't think it will be able to, to be honest with you all.

[00:07:21.130] - Nina
Now I want to share my two favorite tools for AI writing: Jasper AI and ChatGPT. Now when I did this talk a year ago, I did a very similar one, I only talked about Jasper because it was genuinely the only good one back then. Things have changed. There are so many out there. I trialed over 117 this year. My accountant was — I think he was less confused because I also put dog crocs on there as a business expense because I had those. But he was still like, ""What the actual heck is going on here?"" But I wanted to try a lot of them. And there are some that are great, there are some that are terrible.

[00:07:57.060] - Nina
I think the biggest thing is going to be what works for you. AI is always going to be reflective of your use case and of your workflow. So for me, the way that I prefer to write is with an AI writer that can co-write. So something that I can keep working with and reshaping things as we go. I hate one-click AI writers. I have a YouTube video on my ""She Knows SEO YouTube"" where I analyze seven different one-click AI writers to see which is the best. Spoiler alert, all terrible! Not a single one produced a piece of content that I would put on a blog without significant edits, basically complete rewrites, which is what I ended up doing. It was incredibly frustrating. I spent like $300 on SurferSEO credit stuff to do AI articles with them. Every single one got scrapped, completely thrown in the bin because there were a lot of issues with them.

[00:08:50.930] - Nina
And one of the biggest issues is that they claim that they're SEO optimized, but they really do cheap SEO. So they're ticking things off the list. They are including a couple of different elements. We'll talk about those in a minute. But they're not actually writing for the user and they're not allowing you to write. So you're not able to build in your personal experience, your expertise, or ensuring that you've touched on everything for your user. That's not great. That's not really helpful.

[00:09:19.920] - Nina
So that's why I love Jasper and ChatGPT. I use Jasper mostly for affiliate posts, things like that, like long-form content. I've written a number of ebooks with Jasper now. Super easy, super helpful. ChatGPT, I use more for formatting. I really like coding and images and stuff with it now. We'll talk about those later. But I also like it for piece-by-piece content. So if I need to repurpose content, maybe turn a blog post into an email, if I need to write informational content and do header-section by header-section, I refer to those as paragraphs. I hate the word 'header' for some reason. I don't know why, I just don't like saying it. So not my thing. But those are my two use cases.

[00:09:59.140] - Nina
So I have two tools that I'm willing to use for that. Now, there are millions of other ones out there, and some of them have been very good that I've used, but they haven't been better for my workflow than these two.

[00:10:09.340] - Nina
So, I'm not saying that these are the be-all and end-all of tools, and every other tool is terrible. No, every tool is going to be different because it should reflect you and your workflow. I do caution against using a one-click AI writer. I don't think that they are sophisticated enough or really beneficial enough, but I think anything else where it allows you to create content with it is very much based on whatever works for you.

[00:10:37.190] - Nina
Now, I want to know, what have you guys used for AI on your blog? Have you ever used it? What tools? Which ones did you like or dislike? I love learning about new tools. I mean, you all can tell I have a minor addiction to buying them. I still have not stopped. So I would love to know if there are some that you guys use that you really enjoy. Have you used Jasper and ChatGPT? And it's okay if you didn't like them. I know a lot of people who don't, and I will say sometimes that is just because you guys weren't using it right. I definitely had that with a couple of tools I used where I got corrected by friends and strangers on YouTube, and it was helpful actually.

[00:11:11.730] - Nina
But sometimes it's just either not a good tool or it's genuinely not for your workflow. Totally fair, but I would love to know some of the ones that you guys have used and enjoyed because I want to find more, and I want to bug my accountant now.

[00:11:26.290] - Nina
Now, I want to talk about Google's stance on AI because I think this is really important. With SEO, obviously, we need to please the Google gods, so we need to write decent content that's going to rank. It's all about rankability, right? So, if we're going to rank on Google, we need to make sure we are adhering to their guidelines. Google does often say stuff that they don't mean. For sure, they've always said that links are not a factor for ranking, and we all know that's not true. So take it with a grain of salt.

[00:11:54.160] - Nina
In 2022, they explicitly said, ""We do not rank AI content."" And then I had to show a bunch of slides proving that they clearly had because I was doing great and most of my blog is either AI-written or AI-assisted. I think maybe five articles are not AI, but there's a lot of AI on my sites because it can help me write.

[00:12:14.130] - Nina
So, these are the official policies of Google from their ""Google Searches Guidance"" about AI-generated content, which is in Google Search Central. That is where you should go to find basically all of their information on updates, on their rankings, everything. They talk about the helpful content update, they talk about EAT, tons of stuff there. But I pulled out two quotes, or I guess three technically, I don't know, but I screenshotted two things.

[00:12:37.640] - Nina
So, ""Is AI content against Google Searches guidelines?"" Basically, no. Appropriate use is fine. It's just if you're using it to create maybe a thousand spammy posts in a day, they don't like that. ""Do they automatically detect it?"" No, they're not perfect, but it's against their guidelines. ""Do they ban it?"" No. And I think that they had to admit that because they use AI to run their algorithm, so it was pretty hypocritical when they were like, ""You all shouldn't use AI."" Meanwhile, they were using all the AI. But I think this quote is most helpful. ""Our focus on the quality of content, rather than how content is produced, is a useful guide that has helped us deliver reliable, high-quality results to users for years.""

[00:13:20.710] - Nina
They are basically retracting their statement from before and saying, no, quality is what we care about. We don't care if you hired 100 people to write these things in an hour, or if you used AI to write 100 things in an hour. We just want to make sure it's actually helpful content. And I think that is a better stance, to be honest. They're not perfect with it, but they try.

[00:13:43.630] - Nina
Now, I want to share a fun fact. When I got into Mediavine in 2022, I polled people in the Facebook group and I was like, ""Hey, how many posts did you have to get here?"" And on average, it took 100 to 140 posts. Now, for my niche, my primary blog is a travel blog, it took more like 100 to 180, so usually about 160, to get into Mediavine. If you were writing one post a week, which is often roughly what people are doing, and that's actually the advanced level, usually people are doing one every other week, well, it's going to take you like three years to get into Mediavine.

[00:14:22.610] - Nina
I don't know about you, but I didn't have three years to wait. I was working four jobs, none of which I was enjoying. I was working as a law clerk at an Estate law firm dealing with death and dying every day. I wanted to die. I did not enjoy it so much. I was like, I need to get out of here. But I was doing a lot of other things. I didn't have the time to be able to write 100 articles in a year or something at that point. It was going to take me a lot longer if I had to do all of that.

[00:14:54.110] - Nina
The problem was, even though technically maybe I had the time, I was exhausted! I was so tired after all of the work. My brain was just melting. I could not sit down and formulate a good sentence. I knew what I wanted to say, but I couldn't put it together.

[00:15:11.860] - Nina
That's where AI comes in. I was able to completely overhaul my site. I did a six-month push to get into Mediavine, which I thought would take a year, but took six months, where basically for one month, I audited my whole site. I went through, I deleted a ton of content. I had about 180 posts, and 80 of those posts either got deleted or no-indexed, which means that Google can't see it.

[00:15:35.350] - Nina
I had 100 posts left. In one month, I rewrote all of those posts, completely rewrote them. I think there were maybe two that I only had to half rewrite. But I wrote these like— there was one post that I always talk about because it was so dumb. But it was like I was sitting beside my mom in a bed in Singapore because I had flown to see her, and I was writing, ""I'm excited to see my mom in Singapore."" Guess who the only reader of my blog was at that time? Yeah, my mom. My mom was the only person reading that. So why was I doing that? What was happening? But I wrote that post. It was 500 words. It was trash. So I turned it into ""Most Exciting Things in Singapore,"" and then we were able to get somewhere later.

[00:16:18.080] - Nina
I was also writing about 12 new posts a month while working as a freelance writer, writing about 40,000 to 100,000 words a week for a client. So I was able to do so much using my brain power, but just using AI to speed it up. Just like any scientist would — I think scientists or maybe mathematicians are the ones using graphing calculators. I don't know. I haven't touched one since grade school.

[00:16:41.580] - Nina
But no one gets mad at them for using a calculator. So people shouldn't get mad at us for using something to just speed up what we already know to do. But we need to do it the right way. That's where SEO comes in. And these are my steps and my tips, I guess, for writing good content with AI that is actually going to rank. Because if you just walk into ChatGPT one day, first of all, you're going to walk into a laptop because it's not a place, but you're going to say, ""Hey ChatGPT, write me a blog post on Rome."" Okay, what? It has no idea what you mean. It doesn't know what type of content you want it to give you. You've basically walked into a classroom of eighth graders and said, ""Write me an essay about Romeo and Juliet."" But you've never taught them what an essay is, or what essay structure should be, or how to write a good essay. You didn't tell them what about Romeo and Juliet. You didn't tell them even if you meant the book or the movie, or maybe one of the weird adaptations. There's like that gnome cartoon one that exists. You didn't tell them if you meant for it to be positive or negative. You've given no guidance to them at all.

[00:17:47.930] - Nina
So what are they going to do? Write the shortest piece of content they probably can. They're going to try, but they're just going to go for whatever. And with AI, it's going to do the same thing. So it has a cursory understanding of like, okay, blog post means written content, probably title, chunk of words. That's what it knows. Same with that classroom of students. If you walked up to them and just told them to write this essay, if no one's taught them how to structure an essay with an introduction and a conclusion and all these things, they don't know to do that. So you actually don't get to be mad when the output is terrible, because AI is very much a reflection of what you put into it. So you really have to be willing to do the work to get a good piece of content. It is not a one-click solution.

[00:18:34.320] - Nina
So many people are in two camps with AI. It is the, ""AI is coming for your job. It's going to take everything. Freelance writing is dead."" And then the second one, which is, ""I hate the AI, it won't write for me, and that it's not stealing my job,"" and I don't understand either one. We're very much in the middle. Anyone who believes AI is stealing our jobs has not used AI to write a blog post because it can't do it by itself. If I put that graphing calculator on the table, it can't write anything. Even if I just give it 10, and then another number, 12, 000, it doesn't know what to do with that. I've given it no context, nothing to do. Same with AI. You've got to do it. You have to actually do something to help it.

[00:19:18.360] - Nina
But you also have to make sure that you are structuring this properly. You're teaching it how to create this content. So that's where you're going to have to meld this with SEO. We want to make sure that we're getting a strong output that is actually going to be usable for your site. So the first thing you want to do is do some keyword research. Don't just write a post for the sake of writing a post. Make sure it's relevant to your site and to your content overall.

[00:19:42.750] - Nina
So, I actually go a step before this even. Who are we talking to? Who is your audience? Who is your customer avatar? Which is something that we did in my marketing degree. So basically, well it was a publishing degree, but we did some marketing. So I don't know. I don't publish, so it's the only thing I got out of it. But basically, you need to figure out who are we talking to? What are their pain points? What are they struggling with?

[00:20:06.280] - Nina
With AI, I never realized other people were struggling to get it to sound like them because I figured out how to do that pretty quickly. So I was like, okay, ChatGPT sounds like me now. We're set. And then I was like, why is everyone saying that it doesn't sound like them and it sounds like a peppy robot? I do not understand this. And I realized, oh, they don't know how to fine-tune it. Okay, cool, I'm going to write some stuff about that. I'm going to create some social media content about that. Whatever.

[00:20:34.840] - Nina
It's the same idea here. What are people struggling with? What do they need to know more about? But you can't equally just dive in and go, okay, I'm going to write about the most general thing in the world. Some things are too competitive, especially when you're starting. So yes, we're not just going to go for the easiest random things, especially if they don't relate to each other.

[00:20:56.370] - Nina
But we want to use a keyword research tool, and I really recommend a paid one. Honestly, I know money is tight for some people. I fully appreciate that. It was for me. The one thing you should spend money on for your blog to start, especially, is a keyword research tool. I recommend KeySearch. It's like $130 a year. I think it might be less. I'm not even sure. They have Black Friday deals all the time. They have all sorts of deals all the time. They are the best tool. You can get it for a year. If you can't even afford that, buy it for a month and then turn it off for two months and then turn it back on. I would probably check it every three or four months. You need this. It is the thing to buy. Okay, guys? Do that, please.

[00:21:35.130] - Nina
And then look for easy keywords. Things that are going to be green or blue, those are the colors that KeySearch uses to say, ""This is easy."" That's going to allow you to find content that's not crazy hard to compete with. In the travel world, we're always competing against Nomadic Man, who seems to dominate everything, including solo female travel, where I'm like, ""Dude, no. I get that you hired someone who knows this, but come on."" So we want to make sure we're finding stuff that we can get into, because to be honest, it's just like when you're starting with anything, you want to start small and then grow and get bigger.

[00:22:10.100] - Nina
If we started playing basketball and we went to the NBA and tried to play against, I don't know anything about sports, but the biggest basketball player, we're going to quit immediately. So we want to actually start going to, I don't know, is Little League thing for basketball? I'm probably mixing sports metaphors. Why do I always choose metaphors that I don't know about? But you're not really going to succeed at that big one. So go to the small one where you can compete, learn, grow, maybe eventually you get to the NBA. That's where we want to do the same with keyword research for difficulty levels.

[00:22:44.120] - Nina
We're then going to make an SEO outline. I do not trust AI to make my outline for me. AI is a baby intern on its first day at the job, googling frantically between meetings. What is SEO? How do I do SEO? It doesn't know. And as someone who writes SEO content that ranks on Google, I can tell you that the top results on Google never give you 100% of an answer. They genuinely can't. SEO is very complicated. There is a reason that so many of us sell courses on it because also you really need to see it happening. But it can give you a piece of the puzzle and it might have a ton of pieces of the puzzle, but it doesn't know how they fit together. You know, you have the experience so that you can turn that outline into something useful, beneficial to your audience that mentions things that actually are relevant to them.

[00:23:32.150] - Nina
Next, I recommend editing as you go. So Liz actually taught me this last year, but you don't own AI outputs if you haven't edited them. You don't. It's a non-human entity that created it. So you actually have to edit. But what I'm referring to here is something a little bit different. Editing as you go means adjusting the content as you're writing so that it reflects your voice. It reflects your style, how you write blog posts, so that it's good as you go, because the natural language processors, the NLPs behind AI Writers use pattern recognition. If you have allowed a pattern to run that you don't agree with, it's going to keep going and it's going to be a problem.

[00:24:13.930] - Nina
Next, we want to use proper SEO. This means a lot of things. Number one, use that keyword, put it in the title, put it in the URL, put it in the meta description, put it in the alt text, put it where it should be, basically. Use secondary keywords, things that you're going to mention, let's say, ""Things do in New York City."" You're probably going to mention free things to do in New York City in it. Maybe, maybe not. But you're going to mention things that are tangentially related to that topic.

[00:24:40.790] - Nina
If you don't, it shows that you don't know what you're talking about. And also, like Google, SEO is us translating English for a dialect of English that Google understands, that's very algorithmic, and based on things like keywords. And yes, the algorithm updates and changes all the time, so we have to adjust our understanding. But including keywords is a part of that. You don't need to include 1,000 like we used to, but you need to include it at least a couple of times. Google is like, ""Okay I see, she's talking about things to do in New York. Cool. I get it now. I know what we're on with.""

[00:25:13.900] - Nina
Okay, now how do we stand out in an AI world? Because there's so many, honestly, there are. Number one, original research. And the second one is the same thing, detailed analyses and case studies. You really want to make sure that you are doing research. Research should take you the longest of writing any blog post. And some of that is like your past history doing the thing. I'm not saying sit down and research New York City's subway system or something for a million years. 

[00:25:42.290] - Nina
Your past experience is research. But you need to both do that research and then put it in the post. Google doesn't automatically know you did that research. And I've seen a lot of people that complain, especially in the recent helpful content update in the fall of 2023 like, ""Well, I did the thing."" Okay, you didn't show us you did the thing. ""Oh, well, I analyzed 500 posts."" Did you say that? Did you show that? Did you take a picture of any of those things? That's all going to matter.

[00:26:11.750] - Nina
So, we do want to have some original images wherever possible. That could be an original graph as well, like infographics work. You want to make sure you're helping the user. You're solving pain points. You're not just writing to write. You're actually figuring out what they're worried about, and you are serving them with an answer. And then we want to use AI as a co-writer. Don't just tell it, ""Write a blog post about Rome."" You don't know what you're getting and it's probably not good.

[00:26:35.880] - Nina
Now, a couple of unique AI uses I didn't realize other people weren't doing. Coding UX elements, so elements that help user experience. I started coding calculators with AI to figure out — I coded a page view calculator. It's free on sheknowsseo.co if you want to see it, and an affiliate income calculator because I was doing those anyway. And I realized my users were struggling to make that calculation, so I threw that up there. Then I tried a travel calculator, like a vacation budget calculator. Oh my God, that post did well, and it was not a great post.

[00:27:06.390] - Nina
But those extra elements can be really beneficial. I don't know how to code, at all. I can center something in HTML and that's it. But I've also coded eight plugins now with AI. Probably by the time you're watching this, I'll have another 20. It's very much a hyper-fixation right now. But I coded a really cool scavenger hunt plugin that randomly triggers pop-ups so that people will go through your site and then get some cool prizes through this pop-up. It was really, really fun. My audience had a great time, and I gained 15,000 page views in two days from doing that. And it didn't cost me, I think it cost me like $700, but $500 of that was credit in my business, so amazing.

[00:27:45.500] - Nina
You can use this for content audits. I regularly use AI to, especially ChatGPT-4, to read posts and tell me, ""Okay, have the restaurants closed? Are they all still open? Has anything moved? Are the addresses wrong now? Are any of these trails closed from wildfires this summer?"" Super helpful. Now I don't have to do that.

[00:28:04.120] - Nina
You can also use it to add keywords and LSI words. Super simple. You just put in your piece of content and then give it a list of keywords or LSI words that it should add to that content, or that it should say that you missed. So maybe you want to add it in, but it can help you identify what you don't have.

[00:28:20.160] - Nina
So do we have any questions? I'll be in the chat answering them. But while I'm answering those, I just want to take it a step further and give you all a nice little gift. These are my ""Best Jasper AI Commands for Bloggers."" Now these do work with ChatGPT. It's just when I first made this, Jasper was the only thing that existed. But these are my favorite commands for everything from blog post writing, to email marketing, to rewriting, to creating quizzes that are my favorite lead generation opt-ins, to even making your first digital product.

[00:28:49.680] - Nina
And this is 100% free. You can get it, just like follow the picture. I don't know. But you can grab that and I will see you guys in the comments to ask some questions.

[00:28:59.020] - Nina
So thank you so much for joining me today. This has been a ton of fun. I love talking about AI. I love talking about SEO. If you want to find me anywhere else, I am @ninaclapperton on Twitter and Instagram. I share lots of cute photos of my dog who is currently asleep like a bearskin rug beside me. So you can see some cute photos of him in those crocs and help me write them off, because it's a constant battle trying to justify those. You can also find me @sheknowsseo on YouTube. Obviously at sheknowsseo.co, I have a newsletter where I share lots of AI tips and things like that. And lastly, I have my SEO for travel blogger's free Facebook group that you all can join. Any type of blogger, welcome. One day I'll get around to changing it to make it more inclusive. But really, it's just SEO for bloggers.

[00:29:47.580] - Nina
So thank you so much for having me, and thank you to Liz for running this epic summit. And yeah, I'll see you all in the chat for all of your comments, questions, and concerns. Bye.

**Transcript:**
[00:00:09.400] - Liz Stapleton, Summit Host
All right, guys, I'm excited to have Rob Powell back again. He was one of our speakers last year at the 2020 summit. Rob, thank you again for joining us to talk about sort of SEO and growing your reach. Can you tell, for those that weren't here last year, tell em a little bit about your background?

[00:00:25.960] - Rob Powell, robpowellbizblog.com
OK, well, thank you. First of all, thank you very much, Elizabeth, for having me back to speak at the Summit. So I'm a blogger, I guess, mainly in the SEO space. And I started, I think in early 2017. And it's a pretty competitive space I'm in. In retrospect, I probably wish I'd done niched down a little bit, but in the end, it's I guess it's what fires you up and. Yeah.

[00:00:58.450] - Rob
SEO, you know, I love that it's always evolving and I love that about it. But yeah.

[00:01:06.220] - Rob
So it's a very competitive area, that space that I'm in. And yeah, I think the problem is to differentiate yourself from all the other voices out there. It's a big challenge. I've just started accepting guest posts in the last six months. So in the last three or four months, that's been a big change at my end. For ages, I was really worried what that would, what the SEO impact of that. I've started a YouTube channel, but I've been pretty slack about that and that's one of my resolutions is to be more consistent about...

[00:01:41.230] - Liz
Well, you should attend the YouTube sessions. All right, so let's go ahead and dive in, because, I mean, we're recording this at the end of 2020, and 2020 has been unexpected. I think at the very least we could say, of the way the year's gone.

[00:01:53.560] - Rob
Absolutely.

[00:01:53.660] - Liz
And so a lot of people had to learn how to work from home and now are maybe exploring the idea of an online business because of the flexibility it provides. So if someone is starting a blog right now, you know, what should they do to get traffic? Because there's lots of people doing it.

[00:02:08.200] - Rob
Yeah, well, I really believe in organic search. I really believe in free, free Google traffic. But there is a bit of a delay, a bit of a lead-in time for that. Partly because if you're starting off new your website doesn't have any backlinks and also because there's a thing called the Sandbox Effect where Google actually prevents you from appearing in the results for somewhere from three to six months.

[00:02:43.540] - Rob
So basically, during that time, Google wants to see what kind of website you are and establish your bona fides before showing you in the results. And that's a problem for many websites. So in that time, when you're waiting for organic search to kick in, there are two things that I really recommend people do. One of them is to write roundup posts and the other is to write top list posts.

[00:03:11.860] - Liz
OK, so what are roundup posts? Are they specifically of experts? If you can explain what a roundup post is, that will drive traffic. Because you can do roundups of your own posts that aren't going to do as much in those early days.

[00:03:26.800] - Rob
Yeah. So the roundup posts I'm talking about is where you invite anywhere from 20-50 experts in your niche to talk about a particular topic. The question you're going to ask them is very simple. So the quicker, the shorter it is for them to answer, the more likely they're going to participate.

[00:03:47.890] - Rob
So it could be, what's the one thing you would do differently if you were starting again? Or what are your three most important blogging tools? Or what's the most important tip you would give to a blogger starting out in 2021? So that's basically the form it takes. And there are two things that expert roundabout, sorry, expert roundups will do to help you get your blog off the ground. One is that the people you're interviewing usually have high domain authority and the other is that they most often have very large email lists and very large followings on social media.

[00:04:27.040] - Rob
So with the high domain authority, let's say your expert roundup has 45 contributors and only a third of them post a link to your roundup article. That's 15 high authority backlinks you've just earned for your website and that's going to help you rank on Google and with the email lists and the followings on social media. The same thing when they post your article or they share it on their social media accounts, you're basically tapping into their traffic, which is going to be pretty big. And that's because, by definition, influencers and experts have built up large email lists and large social media followings.

[00:05:03.340] - Liz
OK, so we talked about the expert roundup posts, but you also said we should be doing list posts. So what are they and how do they help you build traffic when you have a brand new blog?

[00:05:22.840] - Rob
Well, list posts, one of the reasons I like list posts, is they're much less work than a roundup post. So roundup post involves quite a lot of outreach and there's a lot of to-ing and fro-ing between the contributors and some end up not responding. And then you've got to keep track of who you've outreached to and where you're up to with each person. But a top list post is you're just doing your research and compiling a list of the top 30 or 50 influencers or experts in a particular niche. And you're making you're just compiling a list.

[00:05:56.500] - Rob
But you do need...So with a top list post, you do need a sort of a criteria for ranking them. That can be the number of followers they have, the number of views they have, the number of subscribers. If you've got access to income reports, it could be monthly income. It could be Alexa rank of their website or it could be monthly page views. And it could also be completely subjective.

[00:06:29.020] - Rob
So you can just list the experts or influencers that you like best, but if you do that, you just need to make sure that you explain to the reader what it is you like about what they do.

[00:06:40.180] - Liz
Yeah, because the more sort of organization there is to it, the easier it is for people to see and read and stay on the page, which also goes towards SEO. Correct?

[00:06:49.440] - Rob
Yeah, that's right. Well, actually, one of the reasons for the ranking is that, and this is what makes them so powerful in generating, like, I've done these and they get sort of five hundred shares on social media quite quickly. Top list posts feed into a sort of basic human tendency to want to receive recognition.

[00:07:10.210] - Rob
And yeah, we all have a desire to see ourselves listed on a list of the best performers in our niche.

[00:07:18.550] - Liz
Yeah.

[00:07:20.020] - Rob
And so that's where the ranking comes in. Yeah. So you really do need to I think, have a fairly objective way of ranking people. And that's why those things get shared because people want to say, ""Hey, look, I was on this list.""

[00:07:33.610] - Liz
Yeah, yeah. It's like an award, you know? I was, like, nominated for an award once and I was like, I'm a nominee. You know? X year of this award thing. I was the nominee, you know? Like I didn't win but they nominated me out of all these other people, so...

[00:07:49.950] - Rob
An interesting thing I've noticed is that the people who are going to share your top list, most are not the people at the top, it's the people in the bottom third because they are just absolutely thrilled to be on that list. And so, yeah, you get a lot of traction and they're just very easy to put together. They're really quick. Whereas roundup posts are quite a bit of work.

[00:08:14.380] - Liz
Yeah, herding cats a little bit there, trying to get everything organized.

[00:08:20.740] - Rob
Exactly.

[00:08:20.740] - Liz
And, you know, it's a little bit like trying to get 50 speakers for Summit.

[00:08:25.680] - Rob
Exactly.

[00:08:26.350] - Liz
Yeah, it is quite a lot of work. But yeah, like you said with the expert, if you, a really short, to the point question instead of like a long drawn out one that they can answer quickly and send off, like, that's going to work a lot better.

[00:08:39.130] - Rob
Absolutely. Yeah. Yeah.

[00:08:41.560] - Liz
OK, so thank you for that. Given everything that's going on in the world right now, do you think, I mean, because more people are looking at starting a blog, but do you think it's actually a good time to be starting?

[00:08:52.570] - Rob
Yeah, absolutely. You know, just I with this pandemic things, I don't think things are ever going to go back to the way exactly the way they were before and, you know, people in the travel industry, entertainment, anything with high public contact, those kind of sectors, people in those sectors have had to look for something new. And a lot of people, millions of people are now looking for something to do online. But even before the coronavirus came, there was already a very strong movement towards online learning.

[00:09:29.860] - Liz
Yeah.

[00:09:30.730] - Rob
So it seems that universities and colleges haven't been able to keep up with the pace of change and they're just not agile enough to respond quickly to changes in the marketplace. So even before the pandemic came, there was this enormous explosion in online learning. So there's just a huge demand for information, whether it's free in the form of a blog because that's basically free information or you've got a particular skill set that you can teach through an online course.

[00:10:07.560] - Liz
Digital products, yeah. So it is a good time. There is a lot of people looking and not just looking for jobs right there at home now, they have new hobbies that they're trying, you know, they want to explore. Or the kids are home and ""OK, I need to find someone who has a blog on, what did they, how can I keep them busy all day?"" There's you know, it doesn't necessarily have to be that you're like teaching something, like digital products. You know? It's a sharing of your knowledge, right? It doesn't necessarily teach and it can be a great way to start an online business, but also just to help people. Like it's a crazy time!

[00:10:45.840] - Liz
So I do want to ask you what's the single most important bit of advice you would give to someone just starting out right now?

[00:10:53.340] - Rob
Well, based on my own experience, looking back at it, I would really urge people to niche down. It's not that you can't succeed if you don't niche down, but it's just going to take you longer to breakthrough.

[00:11:08.190] - Rob
So what do I mean by niching down? I mean, I'm just pulling these examples out of the air. But for example, instead of having a website or blog about vintage cars, go for Italian vintage cars. Or instead of a blog about parenting tips, go for a blog about parenting tips for single dads. And instead of a blog about SEO, go for a blog that focuses on SEO for real estate agents. When when you niche down, what happens is, firstly you rank quicker on Google because there's less competition.

[00:11:46.020] - Rob
Secondly, you become seen as an expert in your field much quicker because you're not competing with so many big names. And thirdly, you identify your, you kind of identify your tribe much quicker.

[00:12:04.110] - Rob
So a single dad who arrives on a website that it's just parenting tips, it may have lots of information that's relevant to him. But if he arrives on a website that's called Parenting Tips for Single Dads, that's it. He's, he knows that you're talking about him.

[00:12:23.010] - Liz
Yeah.

[00:12:23.880] - Rob
So, yeah, the more you reach down, the more the people who arrive on your website are going to say this is exactly, this is me.

[00:12:31.380] - Liz
They're going to come back. They're going to engage. They're going to...

[00:12:34.540] - Rob
Yeah, yeah.

[00:12:36.120] - Rob
So that the more, the narrower your niche, it's not that, you know, people have got this terrible fear that there's not going to be...you know, the smaller the niche, the less the traffic. That's not really the big issue, the big issue...

[00:12:50.570] - Liz
It's the better quality of the traffic.

[00:12:52.660] - Rob
Yeah, that's right, exactly right. And people know, people need to know that you're talking to their issues, their problems.

[00:13:01.880] - Liz
If you're trying to write to everyone, you're not going to reach anyone. You've got to write to a person, you know?

[00:13:06.830] - Rob
Exactly.

[00:13:07.130] - Liz
Really narrow it down and it's not that other people can't get something from it too, they probably will, but the more specific you are, the better success you'll see has been my experience.

[00:13:18.080] - Rob
Yeah, absolutely. Yeah, yeah. 

[00:13:20.900] - Liz
All right. So on that note, where can bloggers find out more about you and your services?

[00:13:28.030] - Rob
Well, it's on robpowellbizblog.com, and I've got a link to it on the Summit.

[00:13:34.030] - Liz
Yeah, yeah, it's on the page.

[00:13:36.880] - Rob
Yeah, I'm just going to have some tips on how to get started with SEO. Just some basic beginner level tips for how to get started with SEO.

[00:13:49.780] - Liz
Yeah, you guys should definitely go check that out.

[00:13:52.300] - Rob
Like I said, this is Rob second year speaking. He's excellent! People really got a lot out of his talk last year and the thing he was offering on his site. So I have no doubt that you'll get a lot out of it this year. Definitely go check it out. Rob, again, thank you so much for taking the time. Anything else you want to add?

[00:14:08.920] - Liz
No, that was it. And thank you very much again, Elizabeth, for having me on the Summit. Thank you!

**Transcript:**
[00:00:03.120] - Liz Stapleton, Host
All right, guys. I'm super excited for the session with Rob Powell from the Rob Powell biz blog, joining us from Australia, as you believe. Thank you so much for doing the session.

[00:00:13.150] - Rob Powell
You're welcome, Elizabeth. Good to be here. Thank you for having me on the program.

[00:00:18.610] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Yes. And we're going to be talking about SEO or Search Engine Optimization, which is something a lot of people get tripped up on. Can you give us the highlights of what you're going to cover?

[00:00:28.890] - Rob Powell
Yeah. Well, I'm just going to be talking about the seven trends for 2020 in SEO, which are basically from a focus on keywords to topics, featured snippets. Video is going to be very big. Mobile user experience is huge. Adapting to zero click searches is another new thing that's started in 2019. Optimizing for voice search and using structured data on your website.

[00:01:02.510] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Okay, yeah. I want to be doing all those things. So let's go ahead and dive in.

[00:01:08.170] - Rob Powell
Yeah. So I thought I'd just start by talking about why SEO is so important. It's getting really difficult now to get noticed on the internet. So I started blogging about three years ago, and even in that time, it's become much more difficult. They're just a sheer amount of competition. What I like about SEO is it delivers highly targeted people to your website. So if someone finds your website through Google search, it means they're absolutely looking for what you're offering. They're not.

[00:01:41.570] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Browsing interest, yeah.

[00:01:44.010] - Rob Powell
That's how Google works. It only delivers targeted people. The other thing I like about SEO is it's incremental. So every new blog post you write builds on the traffic from the blog post before. That's quite different to social media, where social media posts just have... They just tend to disappear. And then when you add your next post, you're just starting from scratch again. So to give you an idea of what that means, a tweet lasts 18 to 20 minutes, and a Facebook post lasts two and a half to five hours, and an Instagram post lasts about 19 hours. But by contrast, I've got articles on page one of Google that have been there for over a year, and they're just delivering passive traffic without me doing anything. So the third thing I like about SEO is it's quite stable. So as I said, those posts of mine on sitting on page one, they just sit there month after month and I don't do anything. So that's basically why I think SEO is a very, very good option for bloggers.

[00:02:54.290] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Yeah. I do want to just interject for a second on the stability, because if you're producing quality content, it's stable. But if you're on shaky ground in terms of the quality of your content, then Google keeps getting smarter. And that's where you might see drops because some people like the what was it? The update a year or two ago about the health niches and the eat update with authority. So as long as you're in your zone of genius and you're producing quality content, SEO traffic is very stable.

[00:03:24.370] - Rob Powell
Yeah, that's right, Elizabeth. You've got to have topical authority for what you're writing about. And that is the key, really, and I'll be coming to that in a minute. But it's all about topical authority now. And you do have to write very good content. And in fact, with this update that came out, I think on the 10th of January, the January core update, again, it's all about quality. So that's a huge issue for... But yeah, so it will be stable if you write good content. So the first trend, I think this is huge from keywords to topics. Of all the seven points, this is the most important. So basically, the Google algorithm now, it can measure topical authority. It can measure... What it does is it looks for patterns in the way that words clustered together. And by looking at those patterns, it can work out what a topic is and how many subtopics it consists of. So Google now understands thethe depth and breadth of any given topic. And that means that Google can measure topical authority. And what's going to happen is that the piece of content with the highest topical authority is going to be ranked higher.

[00:05:03.630] - Rob Powell
So definitely there's a preference for long-form content that covers the topic in-depth. And there are two ways basically that you can establish topical authority. One is when you're going to write on a topic, map out all the subtopics you can belonging to that main topic and make sure you cover as many of those subtopics as you can. And the other technique is to use what I call or what many people call topic clusters, or they're also called content hubs. This is where you write a main post like a pillar post, and then you have satellite posts all around that main post that go into subtopics in more detail. And I'll just bring up the next slide. So here's an example of a topic cluster. Another example would be, let's say you wrote a pillar post on looking after budigars. The satellite pages would be, budigar diet, budigar space requirements, teaching budges to talk, clipping budigar wings, breeding budigars, and diseases that affect budigars. Can I ask?

[00:06:43.190] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Sorry, what is budigar? I know this is an example, but I don't know what that is.

[00:06:49.960] - Rob Powell
Yeah, well, that's just rock climbing. So these are the different bits, types of equipment.

[00:06:56.210] - Liz Stapleton, Host
No, that I understand. But you were talking about Budgigar?

[00:07:00.350] - Rob Powell
Yeah, Budgies. Budgigars, yeah.

[00:07:03.030] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Is that an animal?

[00:07:04.510] - Rob Powell
The little pet birds that people keep in cages. Oh, okay. Yeah.

[00:07:08.810] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Sorry, I didn't know what those were.

[00:07:11.210] - Rob Powell
Yeah. So the basic point is that the hub page is an overview of the topic, and then the satellite pages go into individual aspects of that topic in much more detail. And that's a very good way of the establishing topical authority because Google is going to say, well, this is really thorough content and it's going to rank it higher. So the next thing is featured snippets. They were huge in 2019, and they're going to get bigger. So featured snippets are part of what's driving featured snippets is Google is trying to keep people on the page. They're trying to stop people clicking away from the results page by presenting the answer to someone's question actually on the results page. So here's an example of a featured snippet. And according to MoZ, the SEO website... Well, the search is more than the search. For those 23 % of all search result pages now have a featured snippet. So people expect this will just increase as Google continues with this focus on giving results on the page itself. There are basically three reasons why featured snippets are a good thing to have. Firstly, they act like a stamp of approval from Google, so they build credibility and trust in your brand.

[00:09:03.820] - Rob Powell
Secondly, Google takes its answers to voice searches from featured snippets, so they give you an extra source of traffic. And the third thing is that featured snippets actually steal traffic from the number one position in the search results. But it's very important when optimizing for featured snippets to understand that there are three kinds of all featured snippets, and it's really only paragraph snippets that you need to be chasing. So paragraph snippets are 80 % of all featured snippets, and they're the ones to go for. So there are three main ways to optimize for featured snippets. One is to ask questions and then answer them. So in other words, that means targeting keyword phrases that are questions. The second way to get feature snippets is to be explicit about what you're about to... If you're about to give a definition, be very explicit about that. So what you say is here's the definition of XYZ, or are you wondering what the definition of XYZ is? The third tip for optimizing for featured snippets is to write very short sentences. So the average length of a featured snippet is 40 to 50 words. So if you keep your sentences in that range, you're much more likely to be selected for a featured snippet.

[00:10:53.990] - Rob Powell
The third big trend in 2020 is going to be video. So according to Forrester Research, video is now 50 times more likely to be ranked in the top position on Google than a text-based web page. And that trend is only going to increase. And it's estimated that by 2021, a massive 82 % of all consumer web traffic will be driven by video. So in terms of optimizing for video, the first thing that bloggers can do is every single blog post can be turned into a video, basically. The only thing is you may need to condense your articles because the average length of a YouTube video in 2018 was 8.4 minutes. So just be aware that some blog posts may need to be condensed. The third thing is divide your videos into clearly marked sections that deal with different subtopics, and that allows Google to pull clips from your video that are relevant to a particular search. It's true.

[00:12:15.070] - Liz Stapleton, Host
And we have sessions on video where we talk about how to do that too. Definitely check out those other sessions.

[00:12:22.380] - Rob Powell
Yeah, for sure. And the third thing, obviously, is just optimize your... Use the tags within YouTube to optimize your videos for YouTube SEO. So that's the title field, the description field, and the tags. So the fourth big trend is mobile, mobile user experience, that's going to be huge. The move towards a mobile dominated SEO landscape has been underway for quite a few years. In March 2018, Google announced mobile-first indexing, which basically meant that instead of taking the desktop version of your website for the starting point, Google now takes the mobile version of your website as the starting point. So Google is basically saying mobile is the standard for us. So the question comes up, why is Google so keen on mobile-friendly content? The thing is that in October 2015, already more than half of all Google searches were on mobile devices. And in 2019, 63 % of Google US organic search came from mobile devices. So this is a huge trend that Google obviously is aware that if it doesn't provide the best search experience for mobile users, it will lose market share. So it's a really big issue for Google. How to optimize for mobile?

[00:14:12.030] - Rob Powell
The most important thing is speed. So in July 2018, Google introduced the speed update, the July 2018 speed update. Basically, Google expects a website to load in less than three seconds. And the reason for that is that mobile devices are often not on very good networks compared to desktop. They're not on broadband. So websites that load slow are going to really give a poor experience for mobile users. And Google is very concerned that websites load fast on mobile. The second thing is to use accelerated mobile pages or AMP, and that's a Google sponsored format for mobile-friendly web pages. It's basically a stripped down version of your normal web page that loads very fast on mobile devices. And the third thing is just to make sure that you're using a responsive WordPress theme. And yeah, mobile responsiveness just means that a website's content adapts to whatever device a person is using. And this is the graphic that Google published in April 2015 to show what it wants and what it doesn't want. So you can see from that graphic that in a responsive theme, the text has been made much larger. So it's readable on a mobile device.

[00:15:57.100] - Rob Powell
So I think that covers the fourth point. The fifth big thing to watch out for in 2020 for SEO is adapting to... Sorry, just before I go to the next point, if you're concerned about whether your site is mobile friendly, just type in Google, mobile friendly test, and you'll see this box here where you just enter your domain and it'll tell you whether your website is up to scratch or not. So the fifth big trend is adapting to zero click search. So what is zero-click search? Well, a zero-click search is a search where that doesn't result in any clicks because the answer to the question is actually given on the search results page. And in 2019, 50 % of all Google searches were zero click. So here's an example of a zero click search. The question is, what's the highest earning movie ever? And the answer is there. You don't even have to click through to the website to get the answer. There's a lot of panic about zero-click search, but I want to make something clear, which is that it's only certain kinds of sites that really need to worry about it. So recipe sites, do it yourself sites, product review sites, travel sites.

[00:17:44.000] - Rob Powell
These are these websites publish information that can easily be summarized in a 40 to 50 word snippet. But if your site gives visitors detailed information on something, such as step-by-step instructions on how to do something, you're much less vulnerable to zero-click search. For example, if you wrote an article on how to set up an email funnel, that's not going to be vulnerable to zero-click search because anyone who wants to learn how to do that will have to read the article itself. But having said that, if you really want to avoid zero-click search, try to avoid using... These are the top 30 most frequently found words in featured snippets, so it's worth keeping an eye on that. Try to write your content without using these words. Write long-form content that covers the topic exhaustively and in great depth. And I'll just give you an example. An article titled How to set up a YouTube channel and get more traffic to your website. That's not going to be very easy for Google to summarize in a featured snippet. But the same article, if it was titled Five Tips for ranking your videos on YouTube, that's quite likely to be summarized in a featured snippet.

[00:19:17.220] - Liz Stapleton, Host
And the thing with a long-form content, if you're covering something exhaustively, like a small part of it, so the YouTube example would be like, Okay, how do I name my channel or something? That could be a featured snippet. But if they're seeing the articles, how to set up a whole YouTube channel, that could then result in clicks. So you still want featured snippets and long-form content to avoid zero-click searches can help with that, too. So it's a little contradictory of when you want to be in a featured snippet and when you don't.

[00:19:49.750] - Rob Powell
Yeah, that's right. I guess the other thing is that if your article is a long form piece of content with very detailed instructions, sure, Google might extract an answer, but the person who sees it is probably going to click through to your article because they realize, hey, this is a definitive guide thing. So the sixth trend is optimizing for voice search. So voice search is on the rise, no doubt about that. Twenty % of all Google searches are now voice searches. And the factors that are driving voice search are mobile phones. So it's just much more convenient for people on mobile phones to speak into a phone than type in a search query, and it's faster. Hummingbird, the Google algorithm Hummingbird is now very good at understanding natural language queries. So that's the second factor. The third factor is all the virtual assistants like Google now, Apple, Siri, Microsoft, Cortana, and Amazon, Alexa. Those are all driving voice search. So how to adapt, how to optimize for voice search? Use structured data or schemes schema. Basically, what schema or structured data is it allows you to tell Google, it allows you to give information to Google about what's on your website.

[00:21:42.510] - Rob Powell
So in a way, in a sense, it's meta information. It's information about information. And when you use structured data, Google has a far easier job understanding your content, and it's more likely to pull your content out to answer a voice query, a voice search. The other thing is to use long tail keywords because voice searches tend to be much longer than text searches. So when you target long tail keywords, it's much more likely that your content is going to be used in a voice search. And the third thing is to deliberately target keywords to the questions. Most voice searches tend to be questions. So, yeah, those are the ways to optimize your sight for voice search. But having said that, I haven't got the graphic here, but there is a graphic on my website that shows that 50 % of all voice searches are actually done in the car. So it gives you... That statistic just shows you that people are not really looking for detailed information in voice search. They're looking for directions or things like that. So again, if you're providing really detailed information on your website, you're probably not going to be able to take advantage of voice search at this stage anyway.

[00:23:12.330] - Rob Powell
It's just people are just... Yeah, it's just very, very... It's not detailed information people are after with voice search. So the last point is structured data or structured data. It's also known as schema marker. And as I said, it's a way of telling search engines about what information is on your page. Search engines, you'd be surprised, they're very advanced, the algorithms are very advanced, but they still find a lot of online content ambiguous. And what structured data does is it removes that ambiguity, and that makes it much more likely that the algorithms will use your content in featured snippets and to answer voice searches. There are lots of ways of adding structured data to a website, but the easiest, in my opinion, is just to use a plugin, a WordPress plugin. There are many of them. But the most popular structured data plugin is called All-in-One Schema Rich Snippets. That's a free plugin. And once you have that plugin installed and activated, what it does is it adds a meta box to the edit screen of every blog post on your site. Just before you hit publish or after you hit publish, you can come into this box and just add the relevant information or upload it.

[00:24:51.570] - Rob Powell
So there's an article image there that you can upload. Just fill in all those boxes, and it's going to make it much more likely that Google uses your content in featured snippets or voice searches. So that's really it. Those are my seven SEO trends for 2020.

[00:25:16.580] - Liz Stapleton, Host
And how to take advantage of them. So one just follow-up question I do have is we talked about choosing keywords that are long tail or whatnot. Do you use any keyword research tool or anything like that to help you see what you need in your content to have it perform well? An Ahrefs or Ahrefs, I think it's actually pronounced Ahrefs, or an Semrush, or there's like Keyword Finder or something. Is there a tool that you use or that you think does really well, Moz, for that thing that you recommend?

[00:25:54.690] - Rob Powell
Yeah. Well, I've used SEMrush and I've used Ahrefs. But what I'm using at the moment is Keyword Finder. I find that very, very quick compared to the more enterprise level tools like SEMrush, and aHrefs. It's got a really easy, intuitive, user interface. And I particularly like the way it ranks. It ranks your... It keeps a track of how well you're doing overall in terms of your positions in the search results. Okay. But more and more, actually, I'm just using Google's own data. So whenever you type in a search query, you'll see this thing called auto suggest that is anticipating or suggesting search terms that you could you could use. I'm getting a lot of my keywords, my long tail keywords just from those five or six suggestions that Google is giving. And also, if you scroll, if you look about halfway down the search results page, you'll see a thing called people also ask. And there's lots of related keyword, long tail keywords there as well. And if you go to the bottom of the page, there's a thing called... I think it's called related searches. And again, there's more suggestions there. And, in fact, you can really...

[00:27:34.870] - Rob Powell
When you look at those things that I've just mentioned and you use those as your keywords, you're really taking advantage of the topical authority thing because what Google is saying is Google is actually telling you these are the things that I understand or Google understands to make up that topic. So you can't actually do better than that because that's coming straight from Google. Google is actually saying these are the topics that we associate with... You've entered your main topic, but these are the other things that we believe make up the whole topic. So you can't do better than that. The only thing I would say about... So in a way, it's... Sorry, in a way, it's- If you want to.

[00:28:21.510] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Stop sharing your screen, that's fine.

[00:28:23.960] - Rob Powell
Yeah. It's possible not to use a keyword tool at all. You can just use Google.

[00:28:29.180] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Yeah.

[00:28:29.480] - Rob Powell
The other thing I do is when you type a search query into Google, you'll see this little text just beneath the box that says the total number of results that were found. That's the level of competition for that keyword. And it'll vary depending on what niche you're in or what industry or sector. But where I operate, I find that the magic figure is about 50 million. So if there's more than 50 million results, that tells me it's starting to get quite competitive. So the other thing about Keyword, I would just say about Keyword tools is that they all have this thing called a Keyword difficulty score, but they're really not an objective metric. I mean, they're just something... Everyone has their own metric for that, but they're not really very reliable. And anyone who does SEO knows that you've really got... Based on those keyword difficulty scores, they don't give you any idea of how likely you are to get on page one. And the other thing is that keyword tools is that the search volume is just a guess. It's just each tool has its own methodology for coming up with search volume. But Google doesn't actually give out search volume.

[00:29:48.070] - Rob Powell
Those are all estimates.

[00:29:51.540] - Liz Stapleton, Host
That's guesses, yeah.

[00:29:52.940] - Rob Powell
Yeah, they're just guesses, really. Yeah. So it's just something to be aware of when people are using paid keyword research tools that some of the information is a bit dodgy. The keyword difficulty is really random, and the search volume is just their best guess, really. Yeah.

[00:30:13.000] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Yeah. So don't be afraid to go after something if you are using something like that, don't necessarily be afraid to go after it if it's saying it's hard because you don't know how it really is necessarily.

[00:30:22.810] - Rob Powell
And the other last point I'd make is if a lot of people worry about whether a search term is going to have enough traffic, but if it's coming up in Google auto suggests or people also ask, basically, there's enough traffic to make it worthwhile going after. So it wouldn't be coming up in Google if there wasn't enough traffic behind that keyword phrase.

[00:30:49.120] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Yeah, I like that. I think that's great. Tiff, any final words before we... I know you have preview we're going to tell them about, but any final words and SEO trends to look out for in 2020 and to be prepared for?

[00:31:01.610] - Rob Powell
I just think that it's keywords from keywords to topics. So the days of optimizing a piece of content for a single keyword are well and truly over. And you really have to look at the whole topic you're talking about. And you need to demonstrate to Google that you've taken a holistic approach to that topic. That's really the key, I think, for 2020. Yeah.

[00:31:25.760] - Liz Stapleton, Host
I think that's a great point. And then you do have a freebie of how to get on page one of Google. It's email course. You want to tell us a little bit about that? The link is definitely below, so you don't have to tell them the URL or anything. But if you want to share some information about what they'll get if they go there and.

[00:31:43.140] - Rob Powell
Enter their email... Yeah. I've got three videos that basically show you my approach to SEO. So my approach to SEO focuses on establishing topical authority. So I write content with very high topical authority, and I guess that's my secret source for getting on page one of Google. And that's what I show you how to do in those three videos, as well as some other stuff like how to win the battle for... How to edge your listing up the search results page by increasing your click-through rate on the search results page, that thing. Yeah.

[00:32:37.540] - Liz Stapleton, Host
They should definitely go grab that. Thank you again so much for doing the session. This is really helpful. I certainly learned a lot. I'm sure the attendees did as well. So just thank you for taking the time.

[00:32:48.600] - Rob Powell
Right. Thank you, Elizabeth. Thank you for having me on the program. Thank you very much.

**Transcript:**
[00:00:09.380] - Liz Stapleton, Summit Host
All right, guys, super excited to be here with Ryan from ryrob.com. Welcome, Ryan. I appreciate you being here.

[00:00:17.420] - Ryan Robinson, ryrob.com
Yeah, thank you for having me. I'm excited. 

[00:00:18.740] - Liz
Yeah, because you have an incredible site that really dives into a lot of different aspects. We're going to be talking SEO today, but do you want to give everyone just a little bit of your background and we'll dive into the good stuff?

[00:00:30.530] - Ryan
My journey has been one of ups and downs and it's been eight years in the making like most people. I think it's really important to say I'm not an overnight success with blogging. But today, what I do is kind of meta: I blog about blogging, which is very funny for me looking at it today because I really started by talking about my journey as a freelancer.

[00:00:55.490] - Ryan
So rewinding eight years, I started my own freelance career. I started blogging alongside, just sharing my experiences; what sucked, what I did well, what was working. So I built my initial audience around this crew of freelancers and I was a freelance content marketer.

[00:01:12.350] - Ryan
It naturally blended over into, all right, a lot of my freelancers want to learn marketing. Alongside that, I'm growing my own blog audience, too, and teaching some courses, and starting to get into podcasting. Eventually, my blog grew to about 500,0000 monthly readers and I switched over to, mostly today, talking about blogging, still dabble a little bit in the side hustle stuff and the freelancing stuff.

[00:01:39.080] - Liz
I feel like a wandering dabbler at some point because you learn so much when you blog that you end up offering some service at some point along your journey.

[00:01:49.580] - Ryan
Yeah, or at least I hope so. That feels like the most authentic way to do it. Someone that starts by blogging about blogging or podcasting about podcasting is very funny to me.

[00:02:01.490] - Liz
Yeah, I agree. I started like six years ago. We're going to be talking about how to rank number one on Google. It makes sense, with your background, that you certainly know how to do this because that's where you get a ton of traffic. Once you put in the work, Google does the work of sending traffic your way. I know a lot of people start diving into SEO and they're like, it's a lot. What would you say is the first place to start?

[00:02:32.560] - Ryan
I think it is important to acknowledge that it is undoubtedly a lot and you can get fully in the weeds on all of these different little things, too, like 20 to 30 different buckets that you can be investing your time and your effort into.

[00:02:47.410] - Ryan
To really simplify it, for me personally, I think the number one thing to have good control on first is the right technical SEO aspects of your site. If you're not using Google's Lighthouse tools, totally free, to run your own website or specific blog URLs even through the tool to see what their exact recommendations are for how to improve your site speed, performance, usability, user experience, do that right now because Google gives you actionable suggestions on what they're telling you will make your site better for their readers.

[00:03:26.740] - Ryan
So, from a technical standpoint, that's a really basic starting point. Today I work with a more technical consultant who helps with fine-tuning kinds of stuff. But I think just getting the best practices dialed in is always the first step. Then beyond that, publishing truly transformative, excellent, high-quality content that helps real people. I think that's the foundation that you should always have in mind.

[00:03:55.070] - Liz
Truly transformational content is easier said than done. Where do you start in deciding what you want to write about? Do you go about it in a very analytical way or how would you get there?

[00:04:14.730] - Ryan
I think the way that I started versus what I do today is a little different, to be fair. Today, I do a mixture of keyword research and planning based on market opportunities, blended with also answering reader questions because I have so many people that ask me super specific things that I realize other people have the same questions.

[00:04:37.320] - Ryan
So, today I'm kind of a blend, but when I first started out, I definitely very narrowly focused on keyword opportunities. Oftentimes that comes from competitor research. So seeing what other people in my space are writing about always gives me inspiration.

[00:04:53.880] - Ryan
It doesn't necessarily guarantee like because Neil Patel's writing about this, that means I should do it, too. I think there's a lot of missteps you can make if you're just chasing the competition. But chances are if someone has been doing this for many years, they have clearly monetized content, there will be opportunities you can identify just from looking at competitors and double-checking your own keyword research, whether it's using a free tool or something like Ahrefs or Moz.

[00:05:25.110] - Ryan
I think those are really valuable and validating there are real people out there searching these things.  I'm very SEO-focused, but again, if there's real people searching on Google, there's also real people talking about it on Facebook, other social networks, too. So I think it's a winning combination by thinking through an SEO lens.

[00:05:48.160] - Liz
Yeah, I think it helps you figure it out. But also, you want to write for people, not algorithms.

[00:05:52.680] - Ryan
Sure.

[00:05:53.340] - Liz
If you're writing just for the algorithm, people aren't going to stay and it's not going to do a lot of good. Going back to keyword opportunities, how do you determine that a keyword is an opportunity?

[00:06:07.050] - Ryan
I like to think today that purchase intent drives a lot of my focus when I'm doing keyword research. If you get an article that does really well SEO-wise, and you get, let's say, 10,0000 people to it coming a day, but they all just leave, they don't complete any sort of action for your business, that's arguably not that much of a win unless you're doing display ads and somehow generating lots of revenue from that.

[00:06:40.590] - Ryan
I don't often advocate for that route with blogs, at least most bloggers. So, yeah, I like to think through purchase intent whether that's some sort of course that I want to eventually sell one day or a digital book you might be able to offer based on your skills and your expertise.

[00:07:00.300] - Ryan
Just thinking through, all right, who's searching for the term like ""how to write a blog post""? What are some ways that that might be monetized, whether it's through recommending affiliate tools, selling your own products, having a podcast that people can subscribe to and you can get sponsors from the podcast?

[00:07:21.720] - Ryan
I like to think through before I get started in the writing process, like, all right, how can a post like this, it doesn't need to be today, but how can it be monetized at some point in time?

[00:07:33.490] - Liz
Okay. Then what is your writing process? What do you think is the best way to go about creating that transformational content once you settle on the focus of the work?

[00:07:46.900] - Ryan
Yes, this is the million-dollar question. I think lots of different writing processes do work for different people. But for me particularly, I always start with a headline. I'll approach it with some sort of framing in mind that feels most natural to me.

[00:08:06.970] - Ryan
I always try and gut check that by just doing a Google search. Seeing the 10 headlines that come up on the first page often gives you a pretty good insight into what Google's saying the intent of searchers might be.

[00:08:20.500] - Ryan
If it's like 10 results that are all talking about top tools for something, then that tells me that you should probably consider following that format for your headline, too. It doesn't necessarily mean that's the right way to go, but the headline dictates the structure an article will take for me.

[00:08:41.360] - Liz
Okay.

[00:08:41.790] - Ryan
Then I'll outline it. I'll do a little competitive research to make sure there's not something I'm completely missing and to look for opportunities to use my own experience or my own research to back-fill holes that I've identified competitors missed.

[00:08:59.980] - Ryan
So, from outlining, then today my process is a little different as far as writing goes than it was a few years ago. I use a couple of good freelance writers that I've worked with for years now and I'll take the headline, take the outline, and then I'll kick it over to them and they'll often generate a first draft that's a couple of thousand words, few thousand words, and they get it back to me.

[00:09:22.780] - Ryan
And I'm more of an editor who, my gosh, I'm so obsessive about my process. I end up doubling or tripling everything I get back from them as far as word count goes, but that's fun.

[00:09:35.020] - Liz
Okay. How important is word count? It depends, I think, on the topic, but if you want to touch on that, explain how it relates to whatever you're writing about, I think would be helpful for a lot of people.

[00:09:48.420] - Ryan
I tend to be one that really leans into in-depth, comprehensive, we talked about transformational earlier. I hesitate to give a really specific number to people, but I don't tend to publish anything less than like 5,000 words on my site these days, for the most part. Sometimes there's a little variance.

[00:10:12.370] - Ryan
I published a guide to blog marketing recently that was 12,000 words. That's the first version that went up and that's on the really high end. Sometimes I'll have something that's 2,000-3,000 words, but rarely is it anything less than that.

[00:10:32.950] - Liz
Okay, gotcha. Then if you're getting articles that are this long, which take time to make them good, how often are you publishing? Because there's a lot of talk of you need to publish at least once a week for blogging, when it comes to SEO, it's quality over quantity, is that fair to say and how do you decide when you're publishing?

[00:10:58.920] - Ryan
Yeah. I for sure take the approach of quality over quantity today in my process. To be honest, for most of the time that I've been blogging, I haven't had a rigorous schedule of, all right, I need to publish this on this day. It's often kind of how am I feeling about writing today? And if it was a good writing day or a good editing day, am I getting something up?

[00:11:26.130] - Ryan
I do aim for trying to publish something once a week when I'm really on my game. But oftentimes I find that even though I aim for once a week, it's more like once every other week or maybe three a month. That's what I've realized I'm falling into.

[00:11:43.940] - Liz
But it still works. You still get lots of traffic, right?

[00:11:46.510] - Ryan
Yeah.

[00:11:47.880] - Liz
Once you've put in the work to creating good content, I'd like you to speak on linking within that and how that can help you. The other question I want to ask you is how long it takes to start seeing the results. So touch on those things. I know, big, wide questions, but...

[00:12:11.720] - Ryan
Well, from the linking perspective, I think starting with internal links, I am psychotic about internal links with my content. Well, an internal link is linking from one article in a blog post to another article on your own site. I'm maniacal about making sure I'm doing that as much as possible. Like, I'll have 10 to 50 internal links in every article I publish.

[00:12:40.680] - Liz
When you have 5,000 words, it's not excessive. If it's 700, 50 is a bit excessive.

[00:12:48.840] - Ryan
Yeah. You don't want to be unnaturally plugging your content. You want it to be contextual. It needs to make sense. You don't want to have 50 of your own links and no links to other websites either. It needs to be somewhat balanced.

[00:13:03.480] - Ryan
Some of it comes with scale. But the importance of interlinking just from the perspective of trying to make Google highly aware of every article on your site and the interconnectedness of the topics you're covering, there's some sort of magic behind the scenes there. I don't really have a quantifiable way to describe it, but it's worked very well for me.

[00:13:27.060] - Ryan
The other component; external linking, so going out and getting links from other authoritative sites, pointing back to your content. Promotion-wise, backlinks, that's by far the most bang for your buck in my experience, when you're promoting your own blog posts.

[00:13:45.810] - Ryan
I think guest blogging, even though some Google experts or employees will frown upon the formal process of guest blogging in their statements and what they say on the Google blog, in practice, it works, at least today. It's the best way to increase the authority of your site more broadly, but then also to increase your rankings for really specific keyword phrases, is by going out and writing 10, 25, 50 guest blogs.

[00:14:16.950] - Ryan
I've honestly written hundreds of guest posts over the last few years. When I'm really on it, I'm having people help me scale up the amount of guest blog posts I'm writing so that I can keep pace with publishing on my own site, alongside publishing for other sites.

[00:14:35.100] - Ryan
I would say do it tastefully. Don't try and cram tons of links into your guest blog posts because then Google will look at that as a little bit more suspicious. So I think keeping it as genuine. Don't overly plug your stuff. You want it to be valuable content for the audience you're writing for, too.

[00:14:57.960] - Ryan
So it shouldn't be treated as a pure tactic. I think it's a combination of audience building and lending your own content credibility. When it comes to the audience building, you want to actually deliver on good articles for those guest sites.

[00:15:14.580] - Liz
Yes, and they may even have guidelines like you can link to your site this many times. I know when I've had a guest post I've taken links out or they put in their affiliate links. I was like, ""This is my site. I'm obviously linking my own.""

[00:15:26.580] - Ryan
Yeah, don't do affiliate links. 

[00:15:30.200] - Liz
That's a not cool move right there. We talked about backlinks pointing to your site and then we talked about external links in your posts. So there is a difference there and you do want to make sure you're including some external links within your post that go to other sites, correct? I just want to make sure we clear on that.

[00:15:47.020] - Ryan
Yes, for sure. I do always recommend linking to the most reputable source that you can find whenever you want to link out. I would advise against linking to a site that, say, is highly competitive with your own sites. If you're writing about, let's say, podcast hosting, definitely don't link to another article on a different site about podcast hosting because you're shooting yourself in the foot. You're lending them credibility for the same keyword phrase you're going after.

[00:16:19.910] - Ryan
But, that being said, within your podcast hosting article, you obviously want to link out to the top podcast hosting platforms. So there's a game to dance between a little bit in some respects. Yeah, I do always recommend linking out roughly somewhere around however many internal links you have. It's not so much a science for me as it is just a feeling. 

[00:16:46.480] - Liz
You do what works. Like you said, you want to be genuine. Don't just link to match numbers or something.

[00:16:55.540] - Ryan
Exactly. Yeah.

[00:16:57.520] - Liz
Going back to backlinks, what have you found to be the best approach beyond just guess posting to actually get backlinks to a specific article? What's been the best approach in your experience?

[00:17:11.950] - Ryan
I've experimented with lots of different things over the years. I've done just the peer blogger outreach where you're just reaching out, identifying an authoritative site that talks about the subjects that you blog about on your own site and saying, ""Hey, you have an outdated link here or it's linking to a resource that's five years old. Here's my article that's brand new or just refreshed. Would you be interested in replacing that old link with my new link?"" I don't have much success with that or I didn't rather so I don't do that anymore.

[00:17:49.810] - Liz
It's very time consuming.

[00:17:49.810] - Ryan
Yeah, very time consuming, low conversions, you could say, but sometimes it works. That's why I always fall back to guest blogging as my number one steady, tried and true practice. I do think also there's a lot to be said about getting a publication column. It doesn't necessarily need to be like the Forbes and Business Insiders of the world. It can just be like an industry site.

[00:18:20.170] - Ryan
Like for marketing, there's Content Marketing Institute, Social Media Examiner. There's lots of niche publications that will allow you to become a contributor if you prove yourself and show that you can write well and deliver on promoting your content a little bit and driving them some readers. They care about eyeballs, too.

[00:18:41.380] - Ryan
Getting a column on an industry publication can actually be an amplification of your promotion because lots of these publications get syndicated by other websites. So I've seen that publishing to contentmarketinginstitute.com, they'll get syndicated by 10 other blogs. Occasionally, if the post does really well, they'll actually work to syndicate it to an even larger site. So you can see some nice surprise wins happen. I don't think it's safe to bet on everything getting syndicated.

[00:19:16.420] - Liz
Yeah, I know. With freelance writing, that's a lot of my credits of being syndicated to other places. I'm like, my links are on Entrepreneur and you didn't necessarily have to do that. The people you wrote for did it. I was just excited. 

[00:19:36.190] - Ryan
Exactly. Like my very first guest post that I ever wrote was for the Buffer social media tool and I got syndicated to INK like the week after, which was completely shocking. I had nothing to do with it.

[00:19:48.820] - Liz
I have to say, you never know what's going to happen with your guest blog because my very first guest blog, which I didn't even know that it was called a guest blog, ended up in a book she wrote. 

[00:19:48.820] - Ryan
Wow, that is super cool.

[00:20:03.030] - Liz
You really never know where guest blogging is going to take you. Back on track,  I wanted to get back to how long does SEO take to, obviously rankings will move around, but to start seeing some results? Is there a typical time frame or window you'd suggest don't give up until you've really put effort in for this long?

[00:20:29.730] - Ryan
Yeah. This is one thing that I will say I have quantified to kind of a science, although it is warped a little bit by how much I'm promoting my content very actively and how authoritative my site already is. These timetables won't be the same for everyone or for many people who are just getting started. But it gives you a barometer to work towards.

[00:20:53.580] - Ryan
Whenever I publish something new, if I know it has the high potential for being lots of traffic and monetizable content, I will work my butt off promoting it. And that's often guest blogging. So I'm writing, ideally, a guest blog post every week with the goal of promoting this one article.

[00:21:11.820] - Ryan
If I'm doing that kind of a cadence promoting it, I will expect within the timeframe of three to six months to see it ideally moving around midway of the first page of Google search results for a keyword phrase. Again, so much variance based on how competitive that search term might be.

[00:21:31.560] - Ryan
But if you're really working hard to promote your content and it is truly a standout blog post within its niche, then I think it's safe to expect like within six months I should be able to start cracking the first page unless you're talking about all 10 results are Forbes, Entrepreneur, INK. It is much harder to compete with those.

[00:21:58.080] - Liz
It isn't impossible but it's harder.

[00:21:59.280] - Ryan
Yeah, it's not impossible. It's just more difficult or it may take longer.

[00:22:03.440] - Liz
Yes, which brings me to my next question. Part of the way you figured that out is using tools, like you said, Ahrefs or Moz to figure out how hard is it going to be to try to rank for this? I believe Moz has some free tools; Ahrefs is a paid tool. How do you go about learning that tech because like Ahrefs can be very overwhelming if you don't know what you're doing? It can. I remember the first time I looked at it, I was like, I don't know what to do because there are so many things.

[00:22:40.830] - Liz
How would you recommend going about that? Because when you start, you probably don't want to invest $100 a month for a tool, but Moz has some free options. How would you recommend that or what should you start with when you're trying to use those tools because there is so much you can do?

[00:22:56.880] - Ryan
Yeah, it's crazy overwhelming. Me today, I'm always elbow deep in Ahrefs. I'm so invested in their platform from an understanding point of view. But with free tools, it seems like every free keyword tool, once they get popular enough, they become a paid tool overnight one day. So I'm always hesitant to recommend a specific one.

[00:23:21.600] - Ryan
I just say Google search free keyword research tool. Often, Google's doing a good job of servicing the ones that are truly free. So try out those options. What I've found is that going after the low to medium volume and ideally, low to medium competition keyword phrases are the sweet spot when you're just getting started because your goal isn't to launch your blog today and rank in a couple of weeks for something like business ideas.

[00:23:55.280] - Ryan
That's a crazy competitive search term. It will take you likely years to get to a point where you could rank for something like that. So going after something like, rather than business ideas, how about small business ideas for moms. That's something that might actually have a decent amount of search volume to it, but maybe it's just a few thousand people a month and maybe the competition is not as crazy competitive for something like that.

[00:24:27.770] - Ryan
Usually, those free tools, I know Ahrefs because I'm using it so much, does a really good job of trying to help you find the right balance between keyword volume and the competitiveness of a keyword phrase.

[00:24:42.350] - Ryan
They'll often say something to the effect of they give you a meter; like on a scale of 0 to 100, how competitive something is. And they'll give you an estimate like you'll probably need to get links from 40 sites in order to rank on the first page for this term. I'm not sure if Moz's free tools give you something as quantifiable.

[00:25:02.190] - Liz
I think they'll probably give you some idea of the keyword difficulty, but not the details of what you need to do. And they limit the number of results you see, I think, on their free because they have a paid version as well.

[00:25:14.900] - Ryan
Again, even all these tools, even the best paid tools in the world are never 100% accurate. I use it as just kind of helping to plot a course.

[00:25:26.760] - Liz
Yeah. And I would say because you can get lost in these tools and doing keyword research forever, you got to actually write the articles.

[00:25:36.230] - Ryan
Yes. Oftentimes I try and recommend and follow my own advice to publish articles before they feel ready. I think if I'm sitting on something and trying to perfect it for days or weeks, I often can wind up optimizing in the wrong direction compared to what readers actually want and what search engines are rewarding best.

[00:25:59.600] - Ryan
So I think there's something to be said for publishing first drafts and then just knowing like, all right, I'm going to come back next week, next month, update it a little bit here, check what kinds of keywords it's starting to rank for over the course of a month. Then maybe that informs you on a total shift about what the topic is for the blog post. So keep an open mind, I always say.

[00:26:22.880] - Liz
Yeah. The beauty of blogging and the internet is very few things are permanent.

[00:26:28.250] - Ryan
Yes, exactly.

[00:26:30.740] - Liz
You can change most everything. 

[00:26:32.960] - Ryan
Yeah. When you look at my articles today, virtually everything on my site has changed dramatically over the course of years. The older an article is, the more it's changed. The more I've added to it, subtracted to it, tweaked the keywords, done different little formatting things. It's kind of crazy.

[00:26:53.630] - Liz
Yeah. And you'll become a better writer over time, too. I'm always like, if you aren't embarrassed by something you did a year ago, you're not learning. 

[00:26:53.630] - Ryan
Exactly. And you'll become better too at figuring out what works for your particular niche as far as SEO and little formatting things about your blog. I think it's important to say, everything can improve over time if you have the right mindset about it and you're still learning and practicing. It's an ongoing effort for sure.

[00:27:24.350] - Liz
Yeah. Anything we didn't cover because these sessions are meant to be short and to the point, anything we didn't cover in terms of ranking on page one that people should know, that you're like, we can't not say this?

[00:27:39.620] - Ryan
Oh, my gosh. At the risk of providing too much advice, I would really just drive home focusing on publishing good content, getting your SEO technical best practices good enough, and then guest blogging as much as you can to promote that stuff. You can add on from there over time, but just doing those three things really well will totally set you apart from the pack.

[00:27:24.350] - Ryan
As you keep building on it and making progress, the rewards really compound too. Once you have a couple hundred guest posts out there, let's say this takes years, but a couple hundred guest posts out there, your site's going to be humming along pretty well, I would argue. At least it should and you'll also have a much easier time at ranking for keywords a year or two down the line if you just start promoting your content as early as you can.

[00:28:37.750] - Liz
All right. Awesome. I know you have a great free resource for everyone. You want to tell them about it?

[00:28:43.000] - Ryan
Yes. I've got free blogging books. I've been writing for years now about blogging and I've packaged my best advice on getting started the right way, writing effective content the way that I go through my own process, and then also promoting your content. It's just at ryrob.com/free-blogging-books.

[00:29:05.500] - Liz
I'll link to that on this page so they can definitely grab it there. Ryan, thank you again so much for taking the time. I learned some things. I know everyone else learned a lot too. Any final words?

[00:29:19.720] - Ryan
Hey, thank you for having me. I'm excited. Keep your excitement going. Channel it into your blog. I love it.

[00:29:26.020] - Liz
Yes. Awesome. All right, guys. And he's on the chat if you want a couple of last minute questions for him to answer. With that, we'll definitely go check out his site, grab those free books. I'm sure they'll help you and we'll catch you at the next session.

[00:29:40.870] - Ryan Robinson
Yeah, thanks for having me.

**Transcript:**
[00:00:03.650] - Liz Stapleton, Host
All right, guys. I'm really excited to welcome back this speaker. He's always a joy to have on. He's a prolific creator, blogger, startup founder, and recovering side project addict that teaches 500,000 monthly readers how to grow a meaningful online business at ryrob.Com. He's also the co-founder at RightBlogger, a suite of high-powered content tools for creators. A big warm welcome back to Ryan Robinson. Ryan, thank you so much for coming back.

[00:00:34.780] - Ryan Robinson
Hey, thank you for having me. Great to be back.

[00:00:37.750] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Yeah. So as we were chatting before I hit record, we're going to be talking about Tool SEO, which I'm fairly clueless on. So I am going to just turn it over to you and pop in with questions because I'm sure I'll have the same ones people are going to have.

[00:00:53.700] - Ryan Robinson
Love it. Yeah. So this is a pretty new thing. Let's start with that, like straight off the bat. I think free tools has not been a thing that many people have the ability to add to their sites because there's been technical challenges with it. I'm going to share my screen here. We're just going to jump in and I'm going to show you an example. I think just showing you some examples will walk us through what exactly we're talking about. The overview of Tool SEO starts with my blog, my place where I experiment with everything myself. Over on my blog, ryrob.Com/tools, you can hop over there and follow along with us. I think you'll gather a lot of inspiration, too, as you're watching. Here on this landing page, this is all the free tools that I've made for my my audiences, bloggers, content creators, marketers, writers, things that will do keyword research for you, stuff that will write a first draft blog post. Things along these lines are what my free tools are about. Because really this tool SEO concept was born out of seeing... I'm going to show you my Google Analytics here. Was born out of seeing that, Hey, I'm getting a crap ton of traffic to my free tools on my site, and I want to open this up for other people who are in different niches, digital marketing, personal finance, travel blogging.

[00:02:24.390] - Ryan Robinson
The sky's really the limit because anything that you're doing, any niche that you're in, your audience has problems. And part of the solutions, in addition to educational, say, how to style content, something else you could offer people is free tools or calculators that help them do something in their daily lives or in their work. So that's the loose idea here. But just a quick overview. I just wanted to show you guys real quick. Some of these tools on my blog, the paragraph rewriter tool, the paragraph expander tool, keyword research, blog title generator. These tools are generating hundreds of thousands of users a month to my site. For me, the way that this works with my business is that people come and use my free tools, and then they have the opportunity if they want to sign up for Right Blogger, which is my more professional suite of tools for content creators. And Right Blogger is where you will, by the time you're watching this video, you will be able to make your own tools like what you see here on my blog. You'll be able to make a tool exactly like this, but say for your niche, and embed it into a page on your site so that you can get in on this free tool SEO play.

[00:03:45.960] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Okay, so I understand that, and I feel like I've seen that pop up more and more. One person comes to mind. Nina Clapperton has, I think, done some similar things. And I see how that makes sense for the traffic, but I don't know how to actually do that. I've experimented a little with having ChatGPT code something for me, and I do have a little calculator coded that's in one of my memberships, and that's fine, but I didn't love it, and I didn't really know how to make it better. I'm definitely curious, your advice on how to do that.

[00:04:17.480] - Ryan Robinson
Yes. The making of the tool part has traditionally been, honestly, the most difficult aspect of it, right? Because you not only have to figure out what you want to help your audience with, I think that's low key. A big part of doing effective tool SEO is choosing something that's a real pain point for your audience and then filling that gap with a tool that can help them do it. That's the foundational first step is put yourself in that beginner's mindset if you're reaching beginners, for example, and really think about what those problems are. I like to do this from where I'm at, too. Liz, I know this will be relevant to your audience. I have tools for bloggers on my site. Things like needing help generating ideas for posts when you're feeling low on inspiration or title alternatives for something like coming up with an article about, let's say, hiking in California. I have a hiking blog as my fun project. Maybe I don't know how to exactly title an article in order to position it well to rank better in SEO on Google. I'll use one of my tools that gives me some SEO meta-title examples.

[00:05:32.900] - Ryan Robinson
And so once you identify that pain point, the actual building thing is exactly what we're solving for at Right Blogger? And my co founder, Andy, would kill me if I showed the the raw version that it looks like right now because it's almost done in development, but he wants it to be polished before we actually show it off. So basically what you'll be able to do is interact with our AI.

[00:05:55.930] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Probably by the time this airs.

[00:05:58.280] - Ryan Robinson
By the time this is live, this will be live in Right Blogger as well. So I encourage people to check it out. It's called Right Blogger Studio in our suite of tools. You can sign up for a free account and check out all this stuff. So there's no strings attached here. I want you to try it out and see if it's something that's interesting to you. But basically, what you'll be able to do is there's a WYSIWYG editor, so there's no coding involved. You'll essentially start by describing the tool that you want to build for your audience, or we'll have some inspiration starter points, too, that can get you started down the right path. But in theory, you're just going to describe the tool you want, and then you'll be able to play with some layout, design elements, and get it matched to your branding, font, color, things like that. And then you'll get an embed code, and you'll be able to embed that tool back onto your blog, whether you use WordPress, Ghost, Wix, it doesn't really matter so much. You'll be able to embed it there. And then from here, what's beautiful about Tool SEO is that beyond just traffic that it can obviously generate for you by solving a need for people, is that it's really good for lead generation.

[00:07:12.170] - Ryan Robinson
You can say have a This tool, let's say you can use it once for free without signing up and then enter your email address to make additional titles or to get additional ideas, something like that.

[00:07:26.410] - Liz Stapleton, Host
That was actually going to be my next question. Is the extent to which when you're doing these free tools, are people having to sign up? Are you having to then manage user accounts? What does that look like? Because yes, it can be great lead gen, but then is it an account that they have to... It can get complicated, I feel like, for people. Can you break that down?

[00:07:45.240] - Ryan Robinson
It can get complicated. What we are doing is basically the most simple version of it. So upon submitting your first tool use, let's call it, maybe you let the first tool use just go for free. There's going to be options you can toggle. If you want to be gated by email, sign up from the start, you could do that, too. But what we see as most effective with my tools is let people use it once or twice for free, and those who are engaged who are clearly getting value out of it, those are the people who are going to come back and want to use it more. We'll give them a pop-up, which you'll be able to do using RightBlogger Studio. You'll get a pop-up that says, Hey, enjoying this tool? Sign up with your email address in order to get three more free uses of this month or 10 more free uses. These are all options you can toggle yourself. But essentially, what we'll do is you'll have the option to just add people directly to your Kit email list. There's going to be other ESPs, email service providers that we integrate with down the line.

[00:08:47.480] - Ryan Robinson
But for now, it'll just be kit or through Zapier. So you could connect with some of the other tools as well. But simply put, add to your email address. We don't want to get into the whole user management side of things, because I think that's, you start to get pretty far out into the weeds there.

[00:09:05.360] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Sure, sure. So do they then have access to that many uses each month? Are they going to have to come back and enter the email again?

[00:09:13.740] - Ryan Robinson
What it'll do is it It'll cookie their browser. Within a 60-day, 30-day window, you'll get to set these settings to your own desire. But you'll be able to identify someone who comes back to your tool to use it more, and you get to set what those limits are. There's going to be an option in the future at some point, too, to gate these with paid use as well. Let's say you wanted to allow one use without signing up, 10 uses with email address, and then unlimited use, you want people to pay for who are really getting value out of it. That's the eventual step.

[00:09:51.030] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Yeah. Again, I was just going to ask about paid plan. But going back to that, because unlimited, you'd want them to pay for, what is the business side costs? Yes, I can see the return on investment, absolutely. But what is the investment going to be beyond building it in terms of usage and the amount of access and things in maintaining it?

[00:10:14.370] - Ryan Robinson
I will be super transparent about this. So honestly, one of the most beautiful things about what AI has allowed us to do is that the costs of this are so insignificant. It's insane. Let's say fractions of a penny for each tool use. And so what we do on our end with RightBlogger is customers on our pro account, which is $29.99 a month, we'll be able to do up to three tools. And then we haven't really defined what that exact number of tool uses will be, yet it'll likely be something between a thousand and 10,000 tool uses per month for your users. Most people are going to fall into that category unless you're driving some pretty serious traffic. And that, for For that use case, we're going to have an additional plan that's $199 a month for people who are really integrating tools into their business processes and are essentially using them as a way to attract qualified leads for products or services you already have set up. Now you're just standing up these additional sales funnels that automate lead generation for you.

[00:11:24.260] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Okay. No, I like that. From there, what have you been seeing in terms of people asking for this or when people use the tool? Because you have, what was that, like 30 plus tools? Are they having to sign up for each individual one? Is it just once you sign up for one, you get access to all of them. How are you using it on your site in terms of that you're finding that's working?

[00:11:54.180] - Ryan Robinson
That's the best question. What we do is we essentially cookie the person's IP address or their browser to figure out, All right, this is the same person. They're using my blog title generator tool today, but if they come back and they're using my paragraph rewriter tool tomorrow, they will not get that pop up again unless they hit some other predefined limit that we have. But the idea here is to make it really seamless, low friction for the people who are getting the most value from your free tools and not be throwing them a pop up for every new tool or calculator they come to use.

[00:12:33.570] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Okay. Yeah, because I think people hate it. Now, are you able to, because you're embedding it on your site, I would assume you'd still be able to do ad revenue on those pages, like display ads? Is that going to be an issue? Is that going to be a conflict? Does it work okay with the pop-ups? I'll adjust because if it's driving that much traffic, it's a great way to monetize.

[00:12:56.360] - Ryan Robinson
As far as I know, there may be some different ad network nuances here, right? Sure. But as far as I know, this should not at all impact your ability to monetize those pages. And in fact, maybe they're actually great pages to monetize. That could also be the case. I would say if you do more of the intrusive pop-up ad-style thing, maybe that would interfere with what our pop-up is. So if there's the ability to turn off pop-ups on tool pages or something, that might be one rabbit hole worth going down. But yeah, no issue from our end. We actually have We have a lot of test sites right now that my partner Andy and I run. One of those sites is called Color Kit, colorkit.Co. We have a bunch of color and design-related tools on there. That is a good example of a page that's using our tool framework but has ads embedded throughout the tool pages. So far, so good.

[00:13:52.620] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Okay. On that note, a lot of times when you're doing lead gen, you'll use one lead magnet or Lead Magnet, not content. Great. That's more specific to content, but Lead Magnet. It will show in multiple phases throughout the site. Is that something that the tool would work for as well?

[00:14:12.530] - Ryan Robinson
Yes. So this is coming in version 2. You are actually predicting all the right questions, which is amazing. In version 2, we want to be able to have a smaller, basically even tighter embeddable widget that you could say embed within a blog post. Hey, I have a blog on my site that's about how to come up with blog ideas that your audience is going to resonate with. Maybe that's a post that I want to embed a small version of my blog idea generator tool in so that right there within the post experience, people can actually use the tool instead of clicking through to a tool page. The short answer is that's on the roadmap. I don't know if that will be live by the time this interview is going, but- I should just keep asking questions to build out roadmap for you. That's it. You're giving us the secret roadmap.

[00:15:03.540] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Clearly, not really. Okay. Well, I think this is fantastic, and definitely something I want to look into for one of my blogs. I think it's just as important that people know what to avoid, what mistakes, what doesn't work? I think that's just as helpful as knowing what does. What would you say, maybe in what you've experimented with, what doesn't work? What mistakes are you trying to keep people from making when implementing this? What does the other side of it look like?

[00:15:33.810] - Ryan Robinson
Two things. Number one is don't solve problems people don't actually have. You could have what feels like a great idea for a tool in your mind, but you may be one of three or four or five people who actually have that problem. I think doing keyword research, just to verify, give you a barometer. Okay, an estimated 1,000 people a month are searching for topics related to what this tool could solve. Just verify that there is indeed a demand for the tool that you want to make. Then I'll share my screen again to show you something else to avoid. Over here on my list of tools, there are so many of them, I have some tool pages, like this image alt text generator, that have no copy on them. There is no descriptive copy other than just the title and a descriptive Here's the description here. I wanted to show this because this is a bad example of a tool page. This just has the tool embedded, and there's nothing that's helping it rank in Google search results, largely because I just haven't gotten to writing the copy for it yet. I'm going to, but I wanted to show you an example of what a good tool page looks like.

[00:16:52.690] - Ryan Robinson
Doing an effective tool page is not just about having a tool embedded, it's about really nailing the pain points your audience has with a solid landing page, too. So below the tool, it's usually the best place to maybe add a video of you showing how to use this tool, talking about it, and then having a bunch of content sections that nail those pain points your audience has, like answer the primary questions, use some good formatting throughout, and then talk about how to use it. Like, teach someone who's a beginner to using a tool tool like this, exactly how to do it. Use some screenshots if you can. I've got some here. And so really, the same best practices that apply to what makes for good, effective content should also apply It's a tool pages. It's not enough just to have a cool tool. You want to also encourage the search engine like Google to say, Hey, there's content on this page that's educational. It seems like it's credible. There's some authority talking about how do you actually get the most out of this tool.

[00:18:05.460] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Okay, I like that, and that was a great example. Going back a little bit to what you had said earlier about the Right Blogger studio and how this is going to work, you said something about a limit to three tools. Is there going to be the ability to test the waters? I think there's demand for this. Build the tool, find out, Hey, no, it's not. Delete it, and now it's not going to count towards your tools. You can I have lots, but there's only three published. I should play around with that.

[00:18:37.090] - Ryan Robinson
Now, that is actually a question we have not defined for ourselves yet, which is so interesting. This question will be answered by the time this video is being watched. But from where I stand, what my intention is, is that you'll have three actively published tools. And so what I believe will happen inside the product is that within studio, within your sandbox, playground, you'll be able to make other tools, and then there will just be the limit to how many can be live and accepting uses.

[00:19:11.340] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Okay. And then my other question is, you said that was for the basic plan, just like 30 bucks a month. Are people going to have the ability to play around with this tool before signing up? They won't be able to publish or anything if they're building a tool, but then if they want to publish, they're like, Yes, this is awesome. Then they could say, Is that free trial, free experimentation going to be possible?

[00:19:37.350] - Ryan Robinson
Yes. Using a free Right Blogger account, you will be able to build tools inside the studio area and play with them, get a look, feel for it. Then it's the piece where you activate it that you'll need to be on the pro plan because the tool users do hit us with some costs that add up over time.

[00:19:57.560] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Yeah, absolutely. From a from I want to build tool standpoint, that's awesome. From a business standpoint, I'm like, that's a really good way to build up your... Okay, is there anything else people should know about Tool SEO? Anything we haven't covered, stuff you think would be good to help get the wheels turning.

[00:20:17.890] - Ryan Robinson
Yeah, I think the alternative side to, say, just tools here is, think about problems that your audience has. This is just zooming out being an effective for what your audience is going through. Tools solve some of those problems. Calculators solve some of those problems. You'll be able to make calculators inside Studio as well. But I really like to think of this as like, this is just another extension of doing a good job of solving real people's problems. I think look at competitors for some inspiration here. If your site is not, let's say, the biggest in your niche, there's someone out there who's getting more traffic, driving a bigger audience, learn from them. See if they have any free tools that you can also gather inspiration from. I've taken a lot of inspiration from Shopify. Shopify is one of the biggest websites in the world, and they have a lot of great free tools. But instead of competing with them on these tools that they get crazy traffic on, I'll take the seed of an idea and then niche it down to idea generator for bloggers instead of just saying a business idea generator. That's competing with the sharks.

[00:21:36.780] - Ryan Robinson
I think taking other ideas that you see out there and then repurposing them for your niche is a really good way to go about this.

[00:21:45.300] - Liz Stapleton, Host
I like that. Yeah. Make it your own. You'll see a lot more of an impact that way as well than if you're just trying to do the same thing as everyone else.

[00:21:53.590] - Ryan Robinson
Totally. Yeah.

[00:21:55.850] - Liz Stapleton, Host
All righty. Well, thank you for sharing all that. I'm excited to check it out when it's live. I know you said you got something for those watching. Can you share that and where they can find you and all that good stuff?

[00:22:10.060] - Ryan Robinson
Yes, for sure. You'll be able to check out Right Blogger Studio just at rightblogger.Com, R-I-G-H-Tblogger.Com. And below the video, you'll also get a code. We're offering 50% off the lifetime of your account to people who join from the summit. And that code is BBS50. BBBS50, and that'll be linked below. And inside Right Blogger, when you join, even with a free account, we created a course that's about using AI as a content creator. And this course has four or five hours of video lectures. There's activities, there's instructions, there's actionable stuff on how you can, first of all, figure out if you want to use AI in your creation process. And then there's a lot of insights, stories from other people beyond just ourselves on effective ways people are using AI and instructions on how to do what you do with the help of this assistant, too.

[00:23:09.340] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Yeah. No, it's been a huge game changer in how I process the summit for sure. I'm a big fan of that. Definitely go check that out, you guys. Again, Ryan, thank you so much. This is so helpful. I'm excited to see where this goes for you.

[00:23:23.540] - Ryan Robinson
Thank you. Thank you for having me.

[00:00:03.180] - Liz Stapleton, Host
All right, guys. I'm so excited to have this wonderful speaker back at the Blogger Breakthrough Summit. He has been here before. He's been on panels. He's awesome. He's a blogger, podcaster, and recovering side-project addict. I can relate to that. He is the co-founder of RightBlogger and head of content at close.com. A big warm welcome to Ryan Robison. Ryan, thanks so much for coming back.

[00:00:29.800] - Ryan Robinson
Hey, thank you. I think this is my third time back.

[00:00:34.130] - Liz
It might be. I don't know. This is the fifth year, though, which is crazy to me. I'm super excited to talk to you about AI and content creation because it is, I feel like it exploded in 2023 massively. I mean it was creeping along in 2021 and 2022, but it really hit mainstream in 2023. And it's got its pros and cons. So how do you think it's been helpful or hurtful towards content creation in general? We'll start there.

[00:01:12.650] - Ryan
It has been both helpful and hurtful. That's the most important takeaway is that these tools help us to do things faster. They don't do them better than humans, in my experience. That is one of my most important messages I want to drive home is that AI content generators, they are not replacements for us as human writers. You just will never be able to completely rely on a tool to generate what you, yourself can uniquely do with your own life experiences. There's just no possible replacement. This is coming from someone who owns a AI tool company, RightBlogger. I started that with my friend Andy earlier this year, who's also a blogger of 15 years. We really have this hypothesis that these tools can take the mundane out of your workflows and speed those things up, say, outline generation, if you're writing a listical, company descriptions, things like that. But...

[00:02:17.059] - Liz
Usually

[00:02:17.680] - Ryan
Usually. Yes. Sometimes AI hallucinates, too. These tools will never be perfect. They'll never be a replacement for yourself. But they're good starters when you use them mindfully.

[00:02:30.990] - Liz
Okay, so what tips or strategies would you give people who are wanting to dip their toes in the AI waters to help with their processes? Because it can be overwhelming. And I think some people try they're like, ""Oh yeah, click a button"" and then it's awful. And then they're like, ""Never mind."" So what's the best way to get started with that? The approach, ways to think about it?

[00:02:54.650] - Ryan
Yeah. Well, I'll share my own process with it. So I don't usually, and again, there's some exceptions to this, but I really don't usually generate entire articles from AI tools. Even though I own RightBlogger, I don't use the article tool all that often. Occasionally, I do. But for me, where I get the most value out of these tools is by using them for smaller things. So generate an outline if you're feeling stuck on how to approach a topic. You can use ChatGPT or in RightBlogger, there's specific tools for this. You can generate an introduction. You can generate blog post ideas. You can do keyword research that is connected to longer-tail ideas based on root terms, and maybe you don't think of those longer-tail ideas.

[00:03:42.360] - Ryan
So, there are really cool ways these tools can be used in both research and in just structuring how you can approach content. Because ultimately, at the end of the day, I think you should not take yourself out of the content creation process because I don't know about you, but everyone watching and listening can probably tell when they land on a post that was totally AI written. And in almost every instance, I bounce immediately. I'm like, ""Nope, this isn't for me.""

[00:04:11.450] - Ryan
And I want to feel something from the writer who is actually behind the content. And if anything, in the age of AI, that makes our superpower as humans, that much more powerful and important when plenty of people will just be generating content from the prompts to publish, we now have the opportunity to really shine as the unique people we are.

[00:04:37.200] - Liz
Yeah. No, I like that. Just as an example, because the Summit, I automate more and more every year. This is the first year that I'm using AI to help me with some things. And obviously, I've watched every session at least once, usually up to three times by the time I edit it and all that jazz. But then I'm putting the transcript into AI and I'm like, ""Give me the talking points,"" so that I can help speed up the Action Taker Workbook creation, which I'm then still adding to it and stuff. But it's really speeding that process up for me, or I'm like, ""Give me a list of all the resources mentioned,""  so I'm not having to scan through and remember what was mentioned in each talk. So I feel like that's right on path with what you're saying.

[00:05:21.410] - Ryan
That's such a good one. And we have a tool that I made in RightBlogger that takes a YouTube...What's that?

[00:05:28.770] - Liz
Just share your screen.

[00:05:29.840] - Ryan
Oh, yeah. Let me show you right now. We're going to talk about this. Let's talk about this, right?

[00:05:35.060] - Liz
Yeah. I'm like, let's just share a screen. I love the sessions where we just dig into it.

[00:05:40.940] - Ryan
Okay, let me share my screen. Here we go. This is the inside of RightBlogger. And so my favorite tool is the YouTube video to blog post generator because you can take the URL of any video on YouTube, plug it in here, select the  —we have my tone, which is customized. If you want to add more instructions, you can. But basically what this will do is it'll just take any video and it'll write the shell of a blog post for you. So this is exactly what you're talking about.

[00:06:17.730] - Liz
I know. Yeah. And I think what's nice about —there's AI tools where it's like, ""Hey, just give us a thing and we'll give you everything.""  But what you're talking about is really a piecemeal approach, which is I think the most successful way to do it. How can you get creative with AI though? Because you can do tone. What are the best ways to make it the most sounding like you?

[00:06:46.780] - Ryan
So, get super specific with the prompts you use. And if you're using a platform like a RightBlogger, Jasper writer, whatever, you can often give the tool instructions that will just be applicable across the board. ""This is my voice. This is my brand, my style."" But when I'm using, just interfacing directly with ChatGPT to get something quick, I will be so specific with my instructions. I will say something like —I have enough content on the internet to where this works easily for me. ""Write this in the voice of blogger Ryan Robinson. Be casual, be fun, but don't be too fun."" Really get super specific as if I'm talking to a human writer. So, I think that often gives me like much more, much closer stuff. And then you put your editor hat on after you get any output from an AI tool because, man, it just will not be perfect.

[00:07:48.130] - Liz
Okay, so what are some —so a couple of follow-ups. You've given us an example prompt, and now I'm wondering if it would work for me in the personal finance space when I used to be a personal finance freelance writer. But when you put that editor hat on, what are the main things you're really checking on AI? I think facts is a big one. It's gotten better. But what is your checklist of being an editor when you're starting with a rough draft? I consider AI a rough draft.

[00:08:17.570] - Ryan
Exactly. And especially if you're —I mean, you can give a lot of prompts and generate an article that is going to be a pretty good first draft, right? But for me, fact-checking, always number one, right? If you have any statistics or data mentioned in your article, really approach that with skepticism. Almost assume it's wrong and then verify if it is actually correct. So, that's a huge one.

[00:08:45.100] - Ryan
But for me, I really spend the most time on looking at the structure of an article first. So does this article actually approach the topic the way that I would do it? I'll usually catch that during the outlining process. But sometimes AI does weird shit and they'll just throw a random section in here or there that may or may not be accurate. So, really start from that high-level perspective of does this feel like the right article? Does this even make sense? Because you can go through and look for spelling and grammar mistakes, but at the end of the day, if your article doesn't actually make sense for how to approach the topic, you're missing the point entirely.

[00:09:29.040] - Ryan
But voice and tone. I will always, in the introductions, pretty much completely rewrite them. There'll be something that leans into a personal story or something just funny or interesting that is happening in my life, as a way to segue into writing an introduction that is just going to be far more interesting than —AI learns from content that exists already out there. And it often just follows the average template for an SEO-driven article that ranks in the top 10, and that's often very boring stuff.

[00:10:05.870] - Liz
Let's talk about SEO and AI.

[00:10:09.160] - Ryan
Yeah. Oh, I got thoughts.

[00:10:11.400] - Liz
Please share them. I'm just going to give you free rein on that one.

[00:10:14.640] - Ryan
The best way that I like to use AI for SEO-related stuff is in optimization and keyword research. So the two different ends. Helping me to decide what I write about, how to choose topics, right? I try and always meet this crossover of something I'm interested in, something people are searching for. And so that overlap is really the sweet spot. And AI tools can do really a good job of helping you figure out, all right, the term 'blogging', yes, it gets 100,000 monthly search volume, right? But it's probably one of the most competitive terms you could ever try and go after ranking for in organic search. So run a term like 'blogging' through an AI keyword research tool. We have one inside RightBlogger. It'll give you a ton of different options and ideas for ways to approach blogging-related topics. And maybe one of those examples would be like, ""How to start a personal finance blog."" Still competitive, but not as many people competing on it as, say, blogging, right? So finding those more niche, longer-tail opportunities is something that I would say AI is uniquely good at because we don't always come up with every possible idea and angle in our own brains. I love that one.

[00:11:38.160] - Ryan
And then second, optimization. So this is where tools like ClearScope is probably my favorite as far as content optimization. They use AI to power a lot of the recommendations, how many times you should mention your main keyword phrase, and then you get a list of semantic keywords that they've run algorithms and determined it's important to mention this term this many times. I don't treat these things like they're the Bible, that you got to follow each rule every single time and get to an A++ score with every one of these articles you publish. But I find that if you directionally use these tools and you optimize a piece of content into being an A grade, that is often enough to give you an edge over sites you're competing with who are similar to your domain authority and whatnot.

[00:12:34.290] - Liz
Yeah. And ClearScope is one I hadn't heard of. There's so many guys. So if we're saying a tool and you're like, ""but I use this"", chill.

[00:12:42.820] - Ryan
The list of your tools mentioned in this is going to be long.

[00:12:46.520] - Liz
Yes, right. I use Frase, I think, more for like —and I got a lifetime deal on it forever ago. So, everyone's got different things. Okay, so I like breaking that out. I wonder, because AI for repurposing content, for creating content in a different context almost, do you have any advice or tips for that? Particularly, like if you've got a blog post, it's doing well, or you've got a video, and now you want to create social media videos, or snippets, or just social media posts, or whatever. I'm clearly not a social media marketer. I'm like...

[00:13:30.520] - Ryan
The do social media. Yeah, that is another use case that is really great at it. So, the way that I often think of AI tasks are, what would a virtual assistant be able to do for me, without me needing to really get zoomed in and critique, and edit super intensely? So, something like what you were just talking about, you have a blog post, do you plug it into a tool and get a YouTube video script based on it? So, then you can create a video. And then things like obviously social media posts, that's a great one. It can give you, again, very good directional posts to put on your social media channels. And the prompts you use or the tool you use, you'll be able to curate it. Say, if it's Twitter, say, maximum 280 characters or something like that. And you can even instruct it in ChatGPT, especially just tell it like, ""Hey, this will be a tweet for Twitter or X,"" whatever we're calling it this week. ""And please make this engaging in the style that people really interact with on Twitter."" So, you can get super specific. And I find that the more specific you are and what you want generally in life, and especially with AI tools, the better your results will be.

[00:14:57.710] - Liz
Okay, let's walk through, if you don't mind, step by step creating a blog post and where you insert the AI assistant, if you will.

[00:15:08.190] - Ryan
Hell yes, I love that. We talked about one of the most useful ways, keyword research. If I don't have a topic already in mind, which is pretty rare for me, my brain is very active, I will go do some keyword research. Then from there, I'll choose usually something that's a little bit longer-tail, maybe in the thousands of monthly search volume rather than tens or hundreds of thousands. Then from there, I will run it through something like, we have a post ideas generator tool inside RightBlogger. It takes this main term, let's just say, ""How to start a food blog."" It takes that term and then it'll generate a bunch of ideas based around that. Maybe ""How to start a vegan food blog, how to start a gluten-free food blog."" These are the kinds of things where I will use these tools to directionally guide me towards topics I should really prioritize, where I'm going to be able to rank faster and get more traffic as a result.

[00:16:10.810] - Ryan
So starting with that, choosing the topic, and then from there, if I'm really running dry on inspo for a headline, then I'll use a headline generator just to spit out a few ideas. And basically, the purpose of that is to position how I would want to approach an article. So it gives me ideas. I don't often use an exact headline from an AI tool itself. I'll tweak it, or there will be the core of something good in there that I'm like, ooh, that. I can make that better now.

[00:16:42.280] - Liz
The combination of the ones they give you, yeah.

[00:16:44.720] - Ryan
Exactly. And then from there, that's when I personally like to outline my content before researching how other people approach it. I like doing that because it feels more authentically real to me to just see, ""How does this topic generate from within?"" first. Before I go out and see the ways that other humans have approached it, or other AI have approached it, and so that's usually on me, the outline process. And then from there, I'll tackle some subjects, some sections that are interesting to me. And then if there's a section that's not interesting to me, I will throw that into a paragraph generator tool or something like that where it gives me a quick foundation for how I could approach something. But that's, again, only when I find something that's not inspiring to me. I'll usually try and make the genesis of actual content come from myself, and then optimization after writing.

[00:17:56.150] - Liz
Okay. So optimization, you've got it in there. Are you using AI to help you make sure you're linking to all the things to create images? Because writing is just one aspect of a blog post. That's a lot of people who start blogging, they're like, ""Oh, it's more than just writing."" So keep going. What's the rest of your steps, Ryan?

[00:18:22.360] - Ryan
Oh, my gosh. Yes. Let me grab —I wanted to give you the name of a specific plugin because I love it. Okay. I use this one in WordPress for internal linking. So perhaps this is considered an AI tool.

[00:18:38.880] - Liz
Is it Link Whisper?

[00:18:40.340] - Ryan
It is Link Whisper. I got it. Yeah, I'm a big fan of them. I don't often take their straight recommendations and click yes to all, but I will go through and look at which ones do make sense here. So again, it's another case of AI is not perfect. Don't blindly trust it with anything, but directionally useful for me.

[00:19:04.220] - Liz
Yeah. Shout out to Link Whisper because they also are sponsoring the Summit. Love them, but also I actually got to meet them at a conference last month. So it was nice getting to chat with them in person.

[00:19:15.960] - Ryan
Yeah, they're cool people.

[00:19:17.380] - Liz
They are. Cool tool.

[00:19:20.130] - Ryan
I mean, aside from internal links, you got things like —you mentioned image generation. I don't typically do that.

[00:19:28.580] - Liz
There's too many lawsuits.

[00:19:29.840] - Ryan
Yeah, there's too many interesting challenges with it right now. I'm a big fan of Unsplash and Pexels. Those are just the sites that I love to grab stock images from. And yeah, for me personally, I also like having a personal hand in making my featured images for blog posts. I am a very mediocre graphic designer, so I enjoy doing that bit. Now, that is something where I have outsourced graphic design bits to, say, DALL-E inside ChatGPT, and I've gotten good stuff. So there's interesting use cases.

[00:20:09.520] - Liz
Yeah. Okay. So for bloggers who have listened to this but may also be overwhelmed, what advice do you have for them in terms of incorporating AI? Where to start and where to just be chill for now or something?

[00:20:29.620] - Ryan
Yes. Well, first of all, what I really want to drive home is that AI will get better. It will meaningfully change the way we do everything in our lives, during our lifetimes I believe, and especially in content creation. So, I think that having a hand in learning this stuff, in what is the infancy of this age of AI let's call it, is a really good idea, so that you understand where it's at today and see where it's going.

[00:21:02.140] - Ryan
Now, for me, when I'm recommending people to get started with this stuff, I don't recommend diving straight into the deep end of the pool and generating 10 articles in 10 minutes, and hitting publish on all of them. I would say start small, use things like idea generators, keyword research tools, optimizers. Just get a feel for how these things could be used in your process. And when you're evaluating specific elements of your content creation process that you would consider outsourcing to an AI assistant, think about the things that don't bring you energy. So for me, coming up with topic ideas, that's usually pretty fun. I like that. Maybe I'll take an edible(??) and do that, right?

[00:21:47.360] - Ryan
But something like outlining blog posts, I don't really love that, to be honest. I will lean on AI at times when I'm feeling like, ""Oh, this topic, I don't have something that's bursting from within,"" on how to approach this. So, then I'll outsource something like that.

[00:22:05.500] - Liz
Okay, I like that. Any final words in terms of using AI to create not just like content, but great content that people will like, that Google will like, that will move you towards your goals?

[00:22:23.040] - Ryan
Yeah, I highly recommend experimenting with them. I mean, use ChatGPT. If this is really new to you, use ChatGPT. It's free. It's really interesting and insightful. Just play around and experiment with it. Ask it weird questions. See how specific you can get with these kinds of tools. And I think you'll pretty quickly get a feel for how it can be used uniquely for you because it's going to be different for us all. There's different aspects of the content creation process that each of us enjoy more. And so that mix will look different, and I just really recommend experimenting with it to see what your mix is, if it's even for you at all. That's the other thing, is I think, trying this stuff is great. And if you decide wholeheartedly, ""Yeah, this isn't for me,"" then you found your answer too.

[00:23:16.170] - Liz
All right. I like that. I think you have something you want to tell people about that they can get from you?

[00:23:23.500] - Ryan
Oh, my gosh. Yes. So, I mentioned RightBlogger a few times. This is my suite of blogging tools. Most of them are AI-powered. Some of them aren't. But they're the tools that I wish I had for a price point that I wish I could have afforded back when I started blogging too. So, that's the real genesis of this. And if you want to try them out, I'm doing a 50% off lifetime deal for everyone at the summit. Just use the code ""blogger50,"" blogger five zero, and you'll get lifetime half-off.

[00:23:54.120] - Liz
Fantastic. And then you have something in the ""Speaker Bonus Bundle"" as well. Is that right?

[00:23:59.490] - Ryan
I think so. I'll have to check on it and get back to you on that.

[00:24:04.750] - Liz
Okay. The details will be included below, guys. You can just see we're pre-recording. We got to work out the kinks. Ryan, thank you so much. This has been super helpful. I know I learned some new things. I have some new tools to look at, and I'm sure everyone else here did as well.

[00:24:23.120] - Ryan
Thank you. Thank you so much.

**Transcript:**
[00:00:09.460] - Stacy Zant, radiantpearlliving.com
Hello, Blogger Breakthrough Summit attendees, I'm so excited to be here with you today, and I want to give a special thank you to the hosts of this tremendous conference. Liz, thank you so much for inviting me and having me share some valuable information today for you to blog consistently and effectively with a content calendar plan and the KISS method. Keep it simple.

[00:00:37.240] - Stacy
Now, let's jump right in. I'm so excited to share with you how to blog consistently and effectively with a content calendar plan. And of course, we keep it simple method in today's discussion. We are going to cover these five areas. We are going to cover number one, create your content calendar. Two, choose your structure and process. Three, craft your elevator pitch. You'll be able to do that while we're together in this presentation. Four, guest posts and guest interviews. And five, what is your premo plan?

[00:01:15.620] - Stacy
So, welcome. I'm Stacy Zant and I wanted to share a little bit about who I am so that you can understand maybe the expertise and of course, all the things that are on my plate, but nevertheless taking time to blog and to consistently and effectively show up. And I want to help you to do the same. So I'm a wife, a international best selling author, my blogger and speaker, my writing well, mentor and fearless creator. I'm a recording artist and the host of the radio Proliving podcast. I am course creator, coach and podcast producer. 

[00:01:50.980] - Stacy
So, before we go any further, I want to encourage you to download your Fearless Content Calendar sheet and Click Up template. You're going to find that this resource that I've prepared for you is going to help you streamline your steps as we're going through this presentation. And it's going to help you to start with the end in mind. You're also going to be able to envision what you want to create consistently on your blog and the content that you're creating and maybe the different formats that you've decided to get it out there. And then we're going to utilize the Easy Rinse and Repeat system and we're going to go over what that means. And then it's also going to include the done for you templates with recommended tools that you can access. So, we want you to have access to all of this in a simplified and I dare say beautiful format. So, much to share with you. Three components of the Fearless Creator Method that you're going to find throughout this presentation. We're going to concentrate on the KISS, but Keep it Simple Framework for the purpose of this presentation so that you can take some actionable steps and realize you can do this. You can achieve a breakthrough that you're looking for in your blog. And so I want you to decide to make this a part of your future Fearless plan as you blog consistently and effectively.

[00:03:19.450] - Stacy
Then I want you to decide the following: When do you want to produce content? What topics do you plan to address for your audience? And what tools and systems will you utilize each week to prevent overwhelm?

[00:03:38.910] - Stacy
And now, after you've done all of that, the bulk of the work and steps are completed to really making your blogging and producing content. For those of you who have tapped into the potential of podcasting, that goes so well with blogging. We're going to explore the fundamentals now to staying consistent by building a solid foundation that you can use over and over again. This presentation is surely for you if you want to know how to keep it all simple and just have a way of consistently and effectively getting your message out there as you experience Blogger Breakthrough today.

[00:04:17.580] - Stacy
So, in our first point, you're going to create a content calendar. It is so important that the content calendar begins your journey to Blogger Breakthrough because then you can start with the end in mind. I want you to think about what it is you want to achieve through your blog.

[00:04:38.220] - Stacy
Now, having that big picture plan of what you would like to achieve with the content you're creating, especially with a calendar before you, allows you to seamlessly plan what content you should cover. And that will take your audience on an intentional, effective journey that you have crafted ahead of time before the content is actually placed before them. And you'll find that that consistency will be so much easier for you.

[00:05:10.800] - Stacy
I want you to also consider this question. Are you hoping what are you hoping to achieve with the content you create? Are you hoping to achieve something in particular? Are you trying to get a certain pain point and certain relieved? Are you trying to take them on a journey to something else that you offer as a solution?

[00:05:37.140] - Stacy
And we're going to go a little bit deeper into this as we go on, if you can answer this of what it is you hope to achieve to creating that content calendar and planning in advance and having that big picture plan in mind, then trust me, you'll stay the course no matter how difficult it gets and no matter what things vie for your attention.

[00:05:59.160] - Stacy
So, to go a little bit further on the big picture plan I was mentioning to you just a moment ago, I want to present to you an example so that we can make everything really clear.

[00:06:09.360] - Stacy
If your goal is to have readers and listeners end up purchasing a course you created to help answer a specific pain point, for example, like business owners overcoming overwhelm through batching and creating templates for social media. And then you take your readers and your listeners through a journey to like, know and trust you in bite sized snippets of content that you're creating and placing on your blog. So, you can actually do this. As you see with this diagram, you can just take them on a journey, releasing specific content as time goes on. But it is all a part of the big picture plan as to where you are trying to really get your readers to go to so that they can have the complete solution that you can provide and that you've worked so hard to create.

[00:07:08.490] - Stacy
So, if you think about that main course that can come in the form of all of these different offers, some of them you can make free, some of them can be smaller offers. As you see here, the special offer, the email sequence, you can do a mini course, a workbook, a mini guide checklist, eBook, Podcast and webinar master class.

[00:07:28.660] - Stacy
And all of this is content for your blog to really make an invaluable resource for your audience. And I want you to think of what particular elements do you already have incorporated in your content creation plan and what other elements can you add to take them to that place and that big picture plan that you have in mind.

[00:07:51.330] - Stacy
So, now that you have this glorious place that you're leading your readers to, I want you to choose your structure and process. That's number two.

[00:08:01.290] - Stacy
You're going to stick with a plan for at least 90 days. And the best way to do that is to map out your journey and think about things in advance in terms of the content you're creating so that you can be consistent and effective.

[00:08:16.050] - Stacy
Now, you can have two different ways to have that structure and process in place. One is through a spreadsheet, which I've also provided for you in that freebie I've put together for you. And then we have the click up structured process and I'm going to show you multiple ways that this can look like right now so that you can see how easy and efficient the click up structured process can be as you're trying to decide what structure and process you will have in place and you will stick with for at least 90 days.

[00:08:48.900] - Stacy
All right. So, to give you multiple views of what it is that you are able to have as a structure. Right. You are actually going to be getting all of this, including the links and everything, for you to be able to access these formats as well as what I've plugged in here for you today.

[00:09:05.580] - Stacy
So, for your content creation, you'll see you have the list for you. That is one view that you can have off your content calendar plan. Then you have a mind map view. So, we have a view for any sort of person who likes to be able to perceive and make sense of what it is that they are planning, what it is that they're creating, in a visual way that you can keep at the top of your mind. Right.

[00:09:33.660] - Stacy
And then you have the Gantt view to you. All right. That's more of that timeline. And then we have, of course, our traditional calendar view with due dates. All right. And that is one of the things that's most effective about having this structured process is that you can plug in the dates that you want to have a reminder sent to you so that, you know, okay, I need to get this done before this particular date, so that I can stand the schedule and be consistent and effective. Especially if you have a launch coming up and you want to be able to get your audience excited and take them through a journey, a delightful journey where it doesn't totally catch them by surprise. Nor you, because you've planned ahead and you've allowed everything to be in tandem building one upon the other. That is the beauty about having a structure and a process like this in place with your Content Creation plan. And of course, I've made it available and easy for you.

[00:10:33.780] - Stacy
Now you're going to craft the elevator pitch and elevator pitch is just a brief, persuasive speech that he used to spark interest in what you do love does, your organization, your business, whatever you decide to call it, and you can also use them to create interest in a project, in an idea or product or even in yourself.

[00:10:57.890] - Stacy
So, keep this in mind as you're going to craft or elevator pitch in this session today. You're going to walk away with some actionable steps and things you can use.

[00:11:05.870] - Stacy
And of course, you see a picture of this notes page that was provided, Liz provided that, I'm sure, in the package. And you'll find that you can just go ahead and start making the notes with this example and you can use this product as a way of getting the juices flowing. When it comes specifically to your blog and online business.

[00:11:26.660] - Stacy
So, you want to focus on the problems that you solve and how you help people. For example, I normally say, do you know how people lack proper planning and time management skills to make their dreams and business success a reality? I provide a winning solution as a planner, web designer, podcast pro, editor and business coach. And then you can do the same thing. Ask a question.

[00:11:54.590] - Stacy
Start by saying, do you know how people at the dot, dot, dot. What is it that the people that you're serving your audience, what is it that they lack? And then you want to push past the issues preventing them from experiencing. So, tell them what did it what it is that you're helping them with. What is it that is an issue in their life that's preventing them from experiencing that freedom, that thing, that solution that you provide, and then you're going to say that you provide the solutions you need to do just that.

[00:12:28.870] - Stacy
Okay, so take the moment right now. I love normally in my sessions where we put on some music. If you want to pause, we want you to go ahead and pull out your pen. And I want you to start writing right down your elevator pitch and remember this message while you're still thinking about what is it that you want to put at the forefront to be your guide and also to guide others to knowing who is it that you serve and what solution to provide. Just remember, you can do this. Yes, you can.

[00:13:04.880] - Stacy
Can you believe now we're at number four? Just one more number to go. We're making and keeping things simple here. You want to have guest posts and guest interviews? I cannot stress this enough the power of collaboration is enormous when it comes to being a blogger and experiencing breakthrough. I want you to create a system of intake and streamline the collection of information submitted while leveraging your guests audience. Think about that.

[00:13:38.040] - Stacy
You are not just relying on the audience that you have been able to acquire and nurture over time, but think about those you've invited into your space who have expertise and so much value to offer as well, and allowing them to serve your audience. And in return, they are going to share what you have created and what you've been able to highlight them on, because, of course, it makes them also be an expert because someone else is endorsing them and having them share their expertise on their platform- your platform.

[00:14:16.710] - Stacy
And so you want to make sure that you incorporate having guest posts and guest interviews on your blog. I've seen it as simple as having a Q&A where you're asking the question, written out and then someone else that you've invited as a guest with their expertise, answers the question. And it can be read. Of course, one of my favorite ways is to do so in the form of an actual interview and being able to embed that in place. The actual blog content on your blog. But keeping it simple, you are able to just have your guest post questionnaire so that whomever is interested or whomever you've reached out to, to be a guest expert on your platform and your blog, they're able to answer that. And it keeps it so simple. All you have to do is just copy paste and place it there. And that's your ready-Made content to share.

[00:15:06.450] - Stacy
A pro tip though, is that you want to have guest interview, be that process where you can connect with the influencer that you've invited, that expert that you've invited, because once you've made that connection, it allows you to connect deeper with that person.

[00:15:25.680] - Stacy
They also get to know, like and trust you. And they are excited about sharing your content of how you feature them to their platform. And that is going to help, of course, give you both visibility and more partnership and collaboration in a deeper way. That is what I want for you. As a blogger that is desiring to experience breakthrough, this is going to be one of your keenest ways to do so in a very quick, easy and simplified way.

[00:15:58.800] - Stacy
So, now I want you to think about number five. Last but surely not least, what is your promo plan. After you've created all this amazing content and you've taken the time to collaborate and you've taken the time to really craft a journey, a beautiful, delightful journey for your audience? You cannot neglect. And I see this so many times where we just expect for it to go out into the universe and do its thing and make its mark and create effective, lasting change for your business and your blog. But no, you need to remember this and have it at the top of your mind each and every time you create content- what is your promo plan? And I know I want to encourage you to utilize social media without the overwhelm, knowing when to show up, when to pay attention to certain things and knowing what matters.

[00:16:55.050] - Stacy
So, you want to create graphics that are on Brand as you're creating your content. And of course, many people utilize Canva. That's such a simplified, easy way to just effectively be able to plug in and change up whatever wording. What it is that you want to highlight as your headline is a topic and create that catchy, relevant headline.

[00:17:19.350] - Stacy
Now, if you have templates, right, that you are able to access and utilize, then it allows you to spend time on what really matters, spend more time on creating the content that catchy relevant headline and think about it, do your research, then you can also have time to interact and engage in stories. That's where all the magic is happening these days. I know on Instagram it's Real's and people still love watching stories on any social media outlet, Facebook as well as Instagram. And so and I know that Pinterest to a degree, has it as well. So, I want you to share behind the scenes footage if you're asking, well, ""Stacey, what is it that I should be doing as you're creating your content?"" It could be as simple as you taking a picture off your computer screen and showing a sneak peek of what's to come and what it is. You're right. And take a picture of your keyboard and you're typing away. You're giving them an idea of your content creation process behind the scenes. It can be as simple and as enticing as the mouse that you use to click forward in your blog post. You know, it's just so fun seeing the things that people can come up with and that you two can share out there to keep people engaged and allowing them to go over to the content that you've created be enticed to know, ""Hey, what is it that she's up to?"" ""What is this blog thing that she's doing?"" ""And she's so much dedicated time or he is spending so much dedicated time to it?""

[00:18:52.220] - Stacy
Of course, as I mentioned, templates that are easily accessible in your project management system, like I've mentioned before, Click Up allows you to utilize the Rinse and Repeat method. You can also use Google Doc and whatever is easy for you. And I'm going to show you here just how easy this can be. So, you can, of course, access the Click Up the system template and this particular resource here will also help you with being able to effectively having a promo plan in place.

[00:19:25.850] - Stacy
So, you do want to as that's loading and you'll see here, of course, this is live list format where you get a step by step way of just being able to access all the different things you want to do for your content creation plan. And of course, you can create your own and then utilize that over and over again for that rinse and repeat method as a template that all you have to go in, you can prioritize that. You can assign it to other people if you have a VA and there's so much further that you are able to go when you just have something you've created once. And all you need to do is rinse and repeat plugin and make your updates and publish. Right. That is what is going to take out that. Well, when it comes to having one of the most important parts of being a blogger, having that promo plan where you can show up in the different places and spaces to gain interest on the content that, you know, is of great value to those who you serve and not yet serve, but are looking for your solution that you provide. And you showing up behind the scenes and stories or in a Facebook groups when you're able to actually share your link or share your product or solution in those threads. I mean, the sky's the limit once you have a system in place.

[00:20:53.780] - Stacy
So, now it's time to break through. I want you to say that with me. I want you to write it down on your notes page that you've been attentively taking notes as to what to do, because I know it's a lot. Right. But I want you to take actionable steps where you are building the foundation that is going to be what helps you with breaking through.

[00:21:16.490] - Stacy
You're building the foundation to last; I would like to say a lifetime be. All you have to do is make tweaks here and there as you continue to grow, develop and really come into your own. I want you to achieve that as you blog consistently and effectively with a content calendar plan.

[00:21:37.670] - Stacy
Now, for the moment we've all been waiting for I created Just for you is the Fearless Content Calendar plan and click up template that I've made available for you on this specific page. But in addition to that, I am making sure to provide a special savings discount and offer for those of you who were a part of the Summit.
