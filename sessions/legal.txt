[00:00:09.240] - Liz Stapleton, Summit Host
I'm super excited for a session with Amira from A Self Guru. She's a fellow attorney, and so I'll try not to nerd out too much on this session. But, Amira, thank you so much for joining us. And why don't you give people a little bit about your background?

[00:00:23.880] - Amira Irfan, aselfguru.com
Absolutely.

[00:00:24.540] - Amira
Well, it's a pleasure to be here. Liz, thank you so much for the opportunity. And for those of you watching. My name is Amira. I'm a business lawyer, blogger at aselfguru.com. I work full time as a lawyer. And I also have my blog as my side hustle. And so far I've been helping entrepreneurs. I've helped over thousands of entrepreneurs with their legal business, with the legal side of their business, whether through my legal templates or through my one on one services.

[00:00:51.600] - Liz
Yeah. And before we dive in, we do need to say because we are lawyers, that this is not legal advice. We don't know the specifics of your situation. We're probably not licensed where you live, you know, because it is state by state. And so this is really just informational educational purposes to help you kind of figure out what your next step should be. Did I cover it? Is there anything you want to add to our disclaimer?

[00:01:13.810] - Amira
No. I love it. You did my work. I was just about....

[00:01:16.720] - Liz
Well, same for me. Right, because I'm an attorney. I don't want to, so let's go ahead, because a lot of people, when they start blogging, don't realize that there is this whole legal side to it. They're like, they get posting and all that stuff. So what is sort of the first or the most common mistake you see bloggers making when it comes to the legal side of things?

[00:01:37.310] - Amira
Yeah, you're absolutely right.

[00:01:38.610] - Amira
You know, when I started my blog, I notice so many things myself. I mean, blogging is just has so many components to it. But one of the first mistakes that I see bloggers making all the time is they don't have a proper privacy policy on their website. And then we can talk about it like why that's a mistake, because first thing is the privacy policy is legally required. So it's a really important document that every blogger and not just blogger, but any online entrepreneur

[00:02:06.030] - Liz
On any website needs because and it's not like there's it's kind of it's required from like a lot of different parts of a lot of laws.

[00:02:15.540] - Liz
So it's not like there's this one that says websites need privacy policies. There's not. But there's so many laws. And basically it comes down to you need one. It's. For federal, state, local, international, it's just accept that fact.

[00:02:30.450] - Amira
I know, like at this point, I'm sure people are aware of GDPR people that have heard about the California Consumer Privacy Act, just so many different laws. And like you said, Liz, is just one of those things that, you know, you just need it on your website.

[00:02:44.830] - Liz
Yeah. And let's try to explain a little bit what that is and kind of the purpose of it, because people like, well, I'm not collecting information. It's like, well, do you have a contact form? Do you allow comments on your site, are you doing email marketing where you're growing a list? And we have a whole session to talk about GDPR and email list growing and stuff. But, you know, you're probably collecting information without realizing it.

[00:03:05.710] - Liz
So why don't you kind of explain a little bit what a privacy policy is? And I mean, I think in blogging terms, if you do need one, I mean, you just need one period.

[00:03:14.450] - Amira
 Exactly. So a privacy policy is a legal document. It basically informs your website visitors that what information you're collecting from them and why are you collecting it. Because think about it. I come on to your website. I give you my name, my email address. Like if you have an opt in form and I subscribe to your newsletter, then I have now just supplied personal information to you. So as a visitor or as a subscriber, I have a legal right to know what are you going to do with that information?

[00:03:43.330] - Amira
Like how are you going to use it? In what circumstances you will disclose it or you won't. So that's why a proper privacy policy kind of outlines all of that good stuff in there, including your email marketing, compliance and different laws, as we talked about. So that's really in a nutshell, the purpose of a privacy policy is to kind of let your visitors, website visitors know what you're going to do with that information. And like you mentioned, Liz, it's not just your name or your email address.

[00:04:12.760] - Amira
It could be even the credit card information that people are supplying to make a purchase from your website. It could be even Google Analytics, right, because you're getting a lot of data from people when you have Google Analytics on your site, it could be even ads that you're running on your website. So there's so many different ways that you are collecting information.

[00:04:34.150] - Liz
Yeah, I mean, just even if you're not running a bunch of ads, like as we've mentioned, there's tons of ways that you are collecting information.

[00:04:41.710] - Liz
Privacy policy is really just informing your visitors, your readers, of what you're doing, it's being open and honest, because I'm pretty sure we've all gotten those emails from those big companies that had data breaches or whatever. And this is why we see it more and more sometimes. They didn't admit to that until years later, which was really just a jerk move. So it's just you being kind to the people visiting your site is how I like to think of it.

[00:05:04.780] - Amira
Yeah, I couldn't agree more.

[00:05:07.540] - Liz
OK, so. There is, looking at my notes, so there's a lot of different ways you can get a privacy policy for your site. I know Wordpress going that has a default one, but it's a default one for a reason. I think you and I would both say that they should get one from a lawyer. You know, a template from a lawyer is going to be way better than anything free out there.

[00:05:35.600] - Liz
You know, something personalized that you work with a lawyer, one on one is going to be ideal, but not everyone can afford that. And I know you sell templates. Is there anything you know, I don't want to just like like, oh, buy your templates, I mean, yes, they're awesome. Clearly, you've helped thousands. But anything you want to add to that, sort of like you should get it from a lawyer, period.

[00:05:55.360] - Liz
And if you can afford. Well, I always am. Like if you can afford to work with a lawyer, do it. Do you have any suggestions are added?

[00:06:02.320] - Amira
Yeah. And this is a great question. And I get this question a lot. So a lot of times bloggers and I understand that when we're starting our online business, whether it's blogging or any other kind of business cost are high right? So we want to save money and cut corners where we can, but legal stuff guys is not something where you should cut corners on. And I'm not just saying that because Liz and I are lawyers. I'm saying that because over the years as a lawyer, I have audited legal documents all my life.

[00:06:29.630] - Amira
So I've I've also audited the free privacy policies that are floating on the Web. And the big issue with those is that there are always missing key legal provisions kind of exposing you to legal harm and legal liability, defeating the purpose of having this template in the first place. Because if you have a template on your site or a document on your site that doesn't even protect you, then what is the point of it? Right. So that's the first concern with the free legal template that you just grab from Google that it's going to be deficient.

[00:07:01.180] - Amira
I've personally audited them and I found a lot of loopholes in them. The other issue, and it's interesting because I recently actually interviewed one of my customers and her name is Elizabeth, and she's a lawyer, too. So she's actually my customer and she purchased my bundle. And this is exactly the question that I asked her. And I said, Elizabeth, why did you, you're a lawyer, you could have written it or you could have grabbed a free template. Why did you go for my bundle? And she said, you know, she brought up a really good point. And I knew this as a lawyer, but I wanted people to hear from her as my customer. Is that there are copyright violations. You don't know who wrote the free template. You don't even know if you have the legal rights to use it. You just assume that you do. You go on the website and you go on Google and you just grab something.

[00:07:44.860] - Amira
But think about it, do know who created it. You have the legal rights to use it. You don't. You don't get, like, lifetime updates. Like if you were to purchase from me or any other lawyer, you would get some support, some updates. You don't get any of that with the free legal templates out there. So

[00:08:03.670] - Liz
And I also just want to add like a lawyer bought it, because not all lawyers specialize in this.

[00:07:44.860] - Liz
It's why we're not like, oh, that's why I'm like, don't talk, like I'm not trademarks copyright person. Like, I can answer very basic, but really you need to go talk to this person or, you know, there are areas of specialization within the law. And so not every lawyer, you know, like you could talk to your family friend who's a lawyer, and they're going to have a clue as to what you're talking about with your blog and the legal side of things.

[00:08:28.630] - Amira
Exactly. Like exactly like Elizabeth example I gave as a lawyer. Her specialty is not business law. Right? She's not writing contracts everyday like I am. So, yes, you're absolutely right. So you do want to make sure that you get the template from a lawyer that actually specializes in this, that is actually experienced in that realm. And and, you know, you always have the option of hiring a lawyer, too.

[00:08:50.800] - Amira
So this way you get a custom drafted policy

[00:08:53.530] - Liz
That's really going to meet all of your needs because they're going to know state locally what you're actually doing. It'll you know, I always am like once you can't afford that, go do that. Like use the template. Yes. It's going to be a lot better than anything. But once you can afford to, like, hire an attorney to review it, to check it, to add if you're doing something else, do that.

[00:09:13.570] - Amira
Yeah, absolutely. Exactly. So I mean, that just give you that added peace of mind, you know what I mean?

[00:09:20.320] - Liz
And then the other thing... Not that... There's lots of other things, but the next you kind of want to touch on is a lot of bloggers aren't aware of the necessary disclosures and disclaimers. They know about affiliate disclosures but then that's it. So can you dive into sort of the mistakes people make there and sort of what the difference is, why they need them, all that exciting stuff?

[00:09:43.750] - Amira
Yeah, exactly. So another mistake I see is that people always confuse the two terms like disclosures and disclaimers, and they're using them interchangeably.

[00:09:53.140] - Amira
But it's kind of like two separate things. A blog disclosure is when you were like disclosed, just like the names,

[00:09:59.590] - Liz
You're telling them something.

[00:10:00.550] - Amira
Yeah, you're telling them something. You're giving them, you're putting them on notice for something. And then a disclaimer, on the other hand, again, just the way it sounds is when you're disclaiming, you're denying legal liability for something. So in a very simple way to explain, that's really essentially the difference.

[00:10:17.170] - Amira
But they also serve two different purposes. So a disclosure is kind of like legally required under the Federal Trade Commission for affiliate links, sponsorships, things like that. So if you're, if someone is, for example, let's talk about affiliate links first, because a lot of bloggers share affiliate links on their website, they promote products that they're an affiliate for, and then they're going to earn a commission. So now you're legally required by the Federal Trade Commission to give a blog disclosure.

[00:10:46.250] - Amira
And it's basically telling people that, hey, this link is an affiliate link. I may earn a commission if you purchase through my link at no extra cost to you or something like that.

[00:10:55.850] - Liz
And I do want to say, like you explained, what affiliate link means. You can't just be like this is an affiliate link.

[00:11:00.620] - Amira
Yes.

[00:11:00.750] - Liz
Because a lot of people like, as bloggers, we know what that means. But ask your mom if they do, like people that, if you're not specifically blogging about blogging, then a lot of people may not understand that.

[00:11:12.700] - Liz
So you need to either not use that language or you need to explain it, which will mean your disclosure is a little longer. So I just I always like to point that out.

[00:11:20.780] - Amira
Yeah, exactly. And that's another mistake. A lot of the websites that I've audited, they'll just say this, this blog post contains affiliate links and just stop right there. There's no link to the actual blog disclosure or the disclaimer page.

[00:11:34.370] - Amira
And so, yes, that's not sufficient. Legally, you're supposed to go a little extra and at least give them any disclosure, saying that this blog post may contain affiliate links. Please see the full disclosure here and then also write that I may earn a commission. This way it's clear to the reader, what is it that, that you're disclosing? And then the disclaimer, on the other hand, as I mentioned, is your way of limiting liability. So avoiding lawsuits for the content that you publish on your website.

[00:12:02.810] - Amira
So just like how we give our legal disclaimer in the beginning. So that's an example of a disclaimer. But it also is important to know that disclaimer needs to be tailored to the kind of content that you're publishing on your blog. If you're in the health and fitness niche, then you're going to obviously have a health medical disclaimer. You know, if you're in the personal finance and you have a finance disclaimer, it's going to vary depending on the kind of stuff that you're publishing.

[00:12:28.580] - Amira
And essentially the main purpose of a disclaimer is to just let people know that, hey, this is just information I don't want you to rely on this information as advice and come after me later on with a lawsuit. So there are different kinds of disclaimers, again, depending on what is it

[00:12:44.480] - Liz
And it could be something like, that what side of the line you fall on, like in the personal finance space. So I initially started on personal finance. I still have it a little bit by the wayside. I need to get back to it, but I'm not a financial adviser and so I need to say so. And people who are financial advisors, it's going to be similar to like a professional disclaimer, like lawyers like, hey, I am a financial advisor, but this isn't an advice. Whereas mine's like, hey, I'm not a financial advisor, just my own personal experience. You know, it's not official advice. So it's a little bit of a different angle.

[00:13:12.830] - Liz
But it's the same idea because and I we've talked about it, but we haven't really made it clear. Yes, there are laws in place that require you to have certain things, but you're not necessarily going to like go to jail. You know, you may face fines if the FTC it's really going to end up having to sacrifice the money you earned. But really, the biggest thing you're trying to protect yourself from are lawsuits,

[00:13:35.210] - Amira
Correct.

[00:13:36.080] - Liz
Or protect yourself from what you know, so I just wanted to explain from what.

[00:13:12.830] - Liz
But lawsuits is is probably the primary thing that you see a lot of and there's a lot of steps before you get sued. But just keeping in mind that that's really what you're protecting your personal assets, you're protecting your business by making sure you have these things. And that's why it's important, because you don't want to get sued.

[00:13:58.760] - Amira
Exactly, and also you know, another thing I would add Liz, is that you're also putting that professional look out there, right? Like having these legal pages and having, doing things legally it also shows your potential customers, to your readers and just anyone that you come in contact with in business that you mean business. You are professional now. Right. So especially if you started your blog with the intention of making money, turning into a career or a business, then you ought to, then it just goes, it's a no brainer to then just go ahead and make sure that you secure it legally as well.

[00:14:31.670] - Liz
Yeah. And I do just want to mention some other types of disclaimers and disclosures that people might need, we're not going to dive into all of them because we don't have time. But like earnings disclaimers, testimonial, like there's so many different things you need to disclaim or disclose depending on what they are and don't want to use them them interchangeably. But, you know, they are things that people don't realize, they are like, ""oh, testimonials."" No, you need to explain that not everyone is going to have to see those results.

[00:15:02.030] - Liz
So just there's a lot more than just FTC affiliate sponsored stuff. And you don't necessarily have to be compensated with cash. It could be a free product, too, is another thing people don't realize. And a lot of different things you may need disclaim as well, depending on what you're doing. So I just do want to mention that. And any template from a good lawyer, I know you as well. You in particular, you know, is going to include things like that because it's in the nature of this business.

[00:15:30.350] - Amira
Exactly, exactly. Any if, especially if you're going to purchase from our lawyer, you know, it's going to be comprehensive. It's going to cover all of that stuff. Plus more like the limitations of legal liability language, which a normal person can't just write on their own if they're not well versed in the law.

[00:15:44.650] - Liz
Yeah, I just kind of want to mention those things I guarantee anyone that has sales page or something. OK, so. What are you, why shouldn't people be writing their own disclaimers, I guess is a good question to ask?

[00:16:04.730] - Amira
Yeah, I mean, we touched on that a little bit, but because, as you mentioned, Liz, it's not just a simple one liner disclosure, or disclaimer you need like an actual proper policy. Right. That really describes a well written disclaimer page is going to include your affiliated disclosures, affiliate disclaimers.

[00:16:21.860] - Amira
It's going to include your earnings disclaimer, your testimonial disclaimer. So there's so much more to it than just the simplistic way that we try to explain it to you. So because of the fact that it's it's an actual legal policy, a page on your site, you just want to make sure that it's comprehensive enough to kind of cover all your legal bases. So you could certainly try writing one or two sentences here. But if you want to get the protection and feel better at the end of the day, that, OK, I've really covered myself and every possible way I can, then, of course, a template from a lawyer is going to give you that satisfaction.

[00:16:59.480] - Liz
Yeah. And I do just want to mention, because you talk about a disclosures disclaimers page and then we have a privacy policy page. So because I don't think this is talked about enough, that it's having them on separate pages as opposed to one legal page. So do you want to kind of dig into that a little bit?

[00:17:15.770] - Amira
Yeah, a lot of times people will just lump all their legal pages into this one legal page and sometimes they'll call it legal and then you'll just go to that page and you can't even distinguish which one is the privacy policy, which one is the terms and conditions or disclaimer. We'll talk about terms and conditions in a little bit. But but you want to keep them separate. And also, even when you're, for example, going for an ad network, they're going to scan your website.

[00:17:41.540] - Amira
They're going to want to see that you have legal pages on there or not. And you just want to make it easy for them, easy for your readers, easy for your visitors to be able to kind of find these pages, because once again, if there's ever a dispute, there's ever an issue. These are the pages that they're going to refer to. So make it transparent, make it easier to be found, and then don't try to just hide them in this one little page and that people can't really figure out and understand.

[00:18:10.310] - Liz
Yeah, I think that's a good point. Ad networks review it, but also affiliate programs and they may require additional disclaimers. Amazon's famous for requiring a specific disclosure for their affiliate links. So be aware like you can get kicked out of affiliate programs if you're not following their rules, actually read the terms and conditions you agree to when sign up for affiliate programs.

[00:18:34.130] - Amira
Yeah, absolutely.

[00:18:36.830] - Amira
I mean, you have to, it's just one of those things, because a lot of times, even in my Facebook group, I get this question like so many times Amira- can I do this for so-and-so's affiliate program's image or can I do that? And I'm like, don't ask me, go check their affiliate terms and conditions because everyone's going to have different rules and regulations as to what they can, what you can do with their products. Right.

[00:18:58.640] - Amira
Some people allow you to, for example, create a Pinterest pin as an affiliate Pin, but others probably don't. And I've been actually part of those affiliate programs that don't allow you to create an affiliate Pin for their product.

[00:19:11.330] - Amira
So my point is that you definitely want to take a look at that affiliate agreement or affiliate terms and conditions.

[00:19:16.490] - Liz
Pay attention to more than just the cookie length and the payout terms,

[00:19:21.890] - Amira
Yes, especially when it comes to how you're going to use, how are you going to promote that product and how you're going to use their intellectual property, their images and things like that. So, yes, you do want to pay attention to all that stuff so that you're not violating any of their rules and getting kicked out.

[00:19:35.910] - Liz
Yes, no. OK, so we mentioned terms and conditions briefly. Let's dive into that what it is, why bloggers might need it. There's a lot that it can encompass I know.

[00:19:47.620] - Amira
Absolutely. So the terms and conditions think of them like the website rules, right? What you permit, what you don't allow on your website. You may have also heard of them as terms of purchase or terms of use.

[00:19:59.930] - Amira
They're used interchangeably. A lot of people think that, OK, if I'm not selling any products or services, I don't really need terms and conditions. That's not true, although it does definitely help that if you are selling any products or services, you do need terms and conditions. But even if you weren't, you still need them because it covers so many important aspects of your site. Like, for example, what's what's going to happen if there's tomorrow an issue with your reader or with your customer or anybody?

[00:20:27.200] - Amira
Where are you going to resolve that, like legal issue? Like, for example, I live in Florida. I don't know where you live Liz, but if we have an issue, where, your terms and conditions are going to kind of govern, like where you would like that to be resolved because you're binding them to that by putting them on your site. So the point is that there's so many important things, for example, like what people can do with your intellectual property, how can they use your stuff and use something that you would outline in your terms and conditions, what's the intended age of people that visit your website again, something that you would outline in your terms and conditions and so many other important things.

[00:21:05.220] - Amira
And we're going to, again, spend like I hope I can write a whole blog post,

[00:21:08.010] - Liz
we could pretty much spend 30 minutes just on terms and conditions for you and how you use your intellectual property. I feel like a place you see this a lot is like with food bloggers and craft bloggers, especially when they do round up posts or if anyone does a round up a post and they want to round up to other people's content and they just grab the image. And that may not, they may not allow that.

[00:21:28.140] - Liz
And so you need to check with them. If it, if they don't specifically outline it in their terms and conditions, which if they're smart, they will because then they don't have to answer questions about all the time. You know, you can use one for like a round up, but you can't use it in this way. There's a lot of different things, you need permission. And that's getting into copyright and trademark and like you said, intellectual property. But, you know, it's really saying my house, my rules.

[00:21:51.990] - Liz
So if I don't want to approve a comment or if I don't want to or if I want to delete one that's been approved or it's really it's, it's, you're saying my house, my rules. And here's what it is. You can take it or leave it. Right. And that's always how I like to think of it.

[00:22:06.360] - Amira
Yeah, I know. Exactly. And that's the nice, easy way of explaining it.

[00:22:10.710] - Liz
Yeah. So I mean, and if you are doing products and services, you're going to be that's where you're going to have like your refund policy and all that information.

[00:22:20.790] - Amira
Yeah,

[00:22:21.420] - Liz
You don't want you don't want there to be any ambiguity there.

[00:22:24.660] - Amira
Oh, yeah, exactly. Because before, you know it like then you'll be having to then refund and return stuff. If you didn't outline it in your terms and conditions and you didn't have people click to accept them before purchasing.

[00:22:35.250] - Amira
That's another point I want to make, is that when you have your terms and conditions, make sure that on your checkout page that people are actually clicking to, they've got a chance to review it, even whether they review it or not, that's on them. But at least you've given them the chance to take a look at your terms and conditions so that later on they can. For example, if you don't offer refunds later on, you don't want to be liable to refund the product price if, if that's what your terms and conditions say.

[00:23:01.170] - Amira
But if they didn't agree to it, then then you will be for your terms and conditions don't include those policies. Then again, you'll be you'll be forced to get... And that has happened with a couple of people that I know. They didn't have terms and conditions and they had to refund two thousand dollars product. And yeah, it happens. I mean, it happens all the time. And outside of the blogging world, too, like even practicing as a lawyer, I've seen tons and tons of issues that my clients face.

[00:23:25.260] - Amira
And again, it goes back to not having proper legal policies and, on their on their website, especially if it's an online business.

[00:23:33.330] - Liz
Yeah. It's not to say you can't change your policy later if you decide that what you have now, isn't currently working for you. But I wouldn't, you want to kind of abide by your own rules a little bit, like if you say there's a 14 day refund policy, stick to it. If's day 15, your like I'm really sorry, it cuts off at 14 days, you know, like stick your own rules. I know that. I know we always want to, a lot of people want to be people pleasers and, you know, try to do everything.

[00:23:59.280] - Liz
And I mean, there's a line right, where you want to obviously make customer happy. But just keep that in mind, because if you're bending the rules and that's going to be harder to enforce them later.

[00:24:09.570] - Amira
Yes. Yeah, exactly. So, yeah, that's why you need to be very clear. Like you said, make sure that your terms are clear and people can actually understand them. Yes, absolutely.

[00:23:59.280] - Liz
So we've talked about getting templates from lawyers. I know you have a fantastic legal bundle that people should absolutely check out. When she says she's helped tons, she really hundreds, thousands, whatever. You know, I don't know the exact number, but I I've heard about her for years. But you also are giving away a free legal guide. Can you tell us a little more about that? The link to that, to both those things will be below, but or to the right.

[00:24:46.920] - Liz
I'm not sure which side there will be on the screen. But what what can you tell us a little bit about that legal guide nd what people can expect of it?

[00:24:55.050] - Amira
Yeah, absolutely. So a legal guide is basically like your foundation guide when you're starting your blog, you want to make sure that you're covering yourself. So it's going to cover all the things that we talked about. But just kind of in a summary, like conclude like a nice conclusion so that this way you don't feel overwhelmed.

[00:25:13.290] - Amira
So it's going to talk about like the three mistakes that I do see entrepreneurs making all the time. And then I also give you solutions how to avoid them. And as Liz mentioned, if you need legal templates or any legal help with any kind of business, then yes, definitely reach out. There's so much information on my blog, on my website. And yeah, I mean, there's a lot of stuff to go through, and I'm happy to help any time.

[00:25:37.980] - Liz
Yes. So thank you so much. So just aselfguru.com. She has a great website. You probably see her all over social media and Pinterest. I know I do, but thank you Amira so much. Any final words you want to add or information to include that we haven't covered?

[00:25:55.080] - Amira
Yeah, I mean, outside of what we covered, the only tip that I would give to fellow bloggers is that when it comes to like, there are three things that I absolutely don't compromise on and I think you can agree on with me on this, Liz, is that three things like when it comes to the legal stuff, when it comes to your taxes, and when it comes to your health. I feel like those three, all three have serious detrimental consequences on your life and they can really make you lose your sleep very quickly.

[00:26:21.420] - Amira
And I'm speaking from experience because my dad as an entrepreneur was sued and I wasn't a lawyer yet. That's one of the reasons I am a lawyer today. And he were sued for ninety thousand dollars and we didn't see that lawsuit coming from anywhere we could have never imagined. But it did turn our world upside down. We lost our sleep. We lost our appetite. And that entire lawsuit lasted like more than a year. So I when I say that, you know, lawsuits happen and they're scary, I'm not just saying that as a lawyer.

[00:26:51.240] - Amira
I'm saying that from personal experience, having gone through that with my father, helping him navigate through the legalities and the and how devastating that was. And I'm not sharing this story to scare anyone. I'm only sharing this story to just let you know that I know where I'm coming from. Right. So having experienced that hardship. So that's one of the, that's why I always tell, like fellow bloggers and entrepreneurs that when it comes to the legal stuff, don't think that, oh, I'm just a small blogger.

[00:27:15.750] - Amira
I'm this... lawsuits will come in all shapes and forms. Right.

[00:27:20.850] - Amira
And then same thing with your taxes, right? Like, you just want to stay on top of that. And then, of course, your health is your wealth. So, yeah, those are the only three things that I would just share with you and tell you that you should not go. You shouldn't cut corners on, you shouldn't compromise on something that you should take seriously. So take the right steps to protect your blog from the beginning.

[00:27:40.140] - Liz
Yes, I love that. I, I fully agree with that. Thank you so much, everyone. Go check out aselfguru.com. And thank you so much. I really appreciate you taking the time.

[00:27:51.750] - Amira
Oh, I really appreciate you, Liz. I mean, it's so refreshing to see another lawyer interviewing a lawyer. I think that it is so nice to see that collaboration over competition. So I think you're doing a phenomenal job.

[00:27:51.750] - Liz
All right, guys, we'll catch ya the next session.

**Transcript:**
[00:00:12.460] - Liz
All right, guys. I'm super excited to have this speaker back once again. She is an internationally renowned business lawyer, blogger, and coach behind a Self Guru, an online company that's been featured around the world for helping entrepreneurs legally protect their businesses through its affordable legal templates and services. Amira has had the honor of helping over 50,000 entrepreneurs comply with the laws and safeguard their businesses. And she's been featured everywhere, I feel like. Amira, thank you so much for coming back.

[00:00:38.080] - Amira
Oh, I'm so glad to be back. Thank you, Liz.

[00:00:40.920] - Liz
Yeah. So, today we're going to be talking about contracts, which everyone, I feel like if you're not a lawyer, you're a little hesitant because you feel like contracts make you seem pushy or something. But they are absolutely essential if you intend to make this a business. So, maybe let's just cover kind of what constitutes a contract real quick, and then we'll get into kind of the different ones that you know bloggers may need.

[00:01:05.970] - Amira
Yeah. A contract is simply a legal document, right? It's a legally binding document that basically outlines the agreement between you and the other party. So, there's two parties coming together talking about all the things, and then you outline everything in the contract. It's a mutual agreement between two parties to avoid legal disagreements and legal issues.

[00:01:31.310] - Liz
Yeah. And it doesn't have to be complicated. In law schools, offer plus acceptance equals contract. That's really all it is. Okay, so what are some contracts? What is the best way for kind of ease into it without they may not even realize they're already there. But what are some basics?

[00:01:50.810] - Amira
Yeah. So, there's so many different legal contracts that you should think about having to protect your blog. And one of the first ones that I want to talk about is the one that's actually near and dear to my heart. It has to do with the one that I wish my dad had. So, it could have avoided a massive lawsuit in my own family. So, before I became a lawyer, I was going to go to med school, surprisingly. And one day, I come back home and I watched my dad get served with a $90,000 lawsuit. He was sued by a freelancer that he had hired to help grow his business. And that really turned my life upside down and just motivated me to become a lawyer because I helped my dad navigate through the legalities for over a year. Eventually, we settled, but it was a massive setback financially, emotionally, any way you can name it. So, I've gone through the nightmare myself, and that's why I really, really believe in the importance of contracts. Because if my dad just had that, even though people say it's just a piece of paper, but that piece of paper could have prevented a big legal nightmare for us as a family and the financial setback that we faced.

[00:02:55.320] - Amira
So that's why I'm so passionate about like helping entrepreneurs legally protect themselves and give them the tools. So this is the contract that I want to talk about. The first one, it's called an Independent Contractor Agreement or a Freelance Contract. And that's the one that I wish my dad had. Because anytime that you're working with people in your business, and myself included and I'm sure you too, Liz, we always hire people, right? Whether it's contractors, sometimes we hire employees too. But especially in the very beginning to save costs, and it's easier to just hire contractors and dependent contractors in your business, you always want to make sure that you as being the client, that you make sure that you have that Freelance Contract, also known as Independent Contractor Agreement, to outline the scope of works of payment, any other conditions or requirements that you and the client has agreed upon, to just make sure that both parties are on the same page and avoid any kind of legal dispute.

[00:03:52.240] - Liz
Yeah. And I just want to add to that, it doesn't matter who you're hiring as a freelancer. So, my VA is actually she's like my lifelong best friend. She's basically an adopted sister. And we have a contract. We're like, look, we don't want this to ruin our friendship because it could, right? If you didn't have that. So, it doesn't matter even if they're like a family member or someone super close, have a contract in place because it's just going to really, it's going to be helpful. So, I just want to throw that in there because I feel like some people are like, oh, it's just my sister, whatever, but no, have a contract.

[00:04:24.110] - Amira
And that's a great point that you raised because as lawyers, we've seen that happen all the time, that people, like the best friends, the relationship goes sour because they didn't have this agreement upon the financial terms and so forth. And I feel like whenever money is being exchanged, you should always cover yourself and make sure that business is business, personal is personal, right? So, it just keeps the relationship together. And even in my dad's case, the person that ended up suing him was his friend. So, not only my dad felt betrayed, but he also felt like, well, he got punished for being the good guy and trusting this person, the so called friend. And then next thing, you get hit with this massive lawsuit. So, it happens all the time. It doesn't matter whether it's a family member or a friend, you should just make sure that you protect both parties.

[00:05:11.200] - Liz
Alright. So, beyond Independent Contractor Agreement, which like, seriously have one, if you freelance have one, whatever side you're coming at it from, what are some other contracts that might be important for an online business owner?

[00:05:25.630] - Amira
Yeah. So, one of the other ones that is really important for an online business owner is the Terms and conditions. Now this one is a little bit different than your website terms and conditions. I mean, you could certainly make your website terms and conditions to be comprehensive enough to include your products and services, but usually, this is the terms and conditions that I'm referring to, which has to do with any products or services that you sell from your site. So, you always want to have, like, these essential, this is one of the essential business contracts that every entrepreneur or blogger would need because they set out the rules, governing your relationship between you and your customers or your clients if you're providing services. So, by having these clear terms and conditions, you not only protect yourself from any legal action, but you also ensure that your products and services are used the way that you want them to be. So that you protect your copyright, you protect your intellectual property, so that you know that the customers are going to use your content the way that you intended them to. And it's just a great practice, business practice, for you to like also come across as a professional, right?

[00:06:27.660] - Amira
So, someone who really knows what they're doing when they have these terms and conditions properly laid out. And also it just avoids legal issues related to refunds or you know money back or any of those kinds of issues that come up if you don't have terms and conditions. So, this is definitely one of the areas that I feel like sometimes I have come across the bloggers that they forget and then when they run into like a legal issue, where like, a customer has asked for a refund, then they'll reach out to me and be like, what do I do? And I'm like, well, you don't even have any legs to stand on. You don't have any terms and conditions. So, this is why it's really important to make sure that you don't get that financial setback, but also to make sure that your customers truly understand how you intended your services or your products to be used.

[00:07:14.820] - Liz
Yeah. And I will, I do want to add, so one thing I think a lot of people forget to do is they set those up and they forget to change them as their business changes. So, I actually have it as a recurring task in my project management tool to go and review all of my legal policies, like every six months and make sure they're up-to-date and reflective of where I stand now. So, I just would add that as a, you know if you haven't looked at them in a while, if you had them, great. But if you haven't looked at them in a while, go take a look and update them.

[00:07:46.090] - Amira
And it's also, no, that's a great tip. And another tip that I would add is, like, sometimes it's not good enough to just have these, but you also have to get that electronic acceptance, right? So, on your sales page, before that transaction happens during the checkout process, figure out a way for them to at least click to accept your terms and conditions to be bound by them, because that's another important step that sometimes people forget and they think that okay, I just have it on the sales page, so I'm good enough, you know. But you do need that electronic consent.

[00:08:13.860] - Liz
Yeah. And most, I feel like, checkout tool [crosstalk 00:08:16] pretty easy. Yeah.

[00:08:19.090] - Amira
Yeah.

[00:08:19.400] - Liz
And I will say as part of that, like that is huge because when you get those charge backs, you can fight them and you can keep that money.

[00:08:26.770] - Amira
Yeah. I know.

[00:08:27.500] - Liz
And that [crosstalk 00:08:28] help in doing that. I think everyone's like, oh my God, I got a charge back. Like, can I even win this? I'm like, yeah.

[00:08:33.910] - Liz
Yeah. Exactly.

[00:08:34.220] - Liz
You absolutely can.

[00:08:36.850] - Amira
I've actually helped a couple of bloggers win them because once they had set it up correctly and we had that acceptance, then yeah, they were able to fight and then they were able to win. So, it's totally yes, you're absolutely right. And then also, you know, going back to the terms and conditions, you also want to make sure that you have your privacy policy and the disclaimers also set in, and you can incorporate them by reference into your terms and conditions. So that's another step because you are collecting people's personal information, right, like their names, their credit card information, their email address. So, it is definitely a legal requirement to have a privacy policy, too, even though it's not a contract contract. But I just kind of wanted to mention that that's also a legal document that you should absolutely have on your website and even on your sales page.

[00:09:22.610] - Liz
Yes. Yes, absolutely. And we won't get into all the different legalities of conditions.

[00:09:27.750] - Amira
Yes, there's too many.

[00:09:28.870] - Liz
Because there's like six different ones and it's a whole thing, but okay, so privacy policy kind of incorporated into your sort of electronic agreement of those terms and conditions. Okay, so what other contracts come into play? I mean, I can think of a couple, but I feel like, I'm not sure, whatever you want.

[00:09:47.340] - Amira
Yeah, there's so man. There's so many.

[00:09:51.100] - Amira
So, the other third one, which is really relevant and I think it pertains to and it's something that we all will use at some point or some stage of our business and that has to do with using other people's, like photos, videos, audios, testimonials and things like that, legally in your business. Now, there are different names for it, right? You could call it like a testimonial release if it's a testimonial. You could call it like a podcast release if it's an audio or podcast that you're using. But I have kind of combined it together into what's called a media release agreement to just make my life easy as a lawyer and also my customers'. So, media release agreement is basically the type of contract that allows you to use other people's content in that capacity legally, with their permission, and not have to owe them compensation. And then the release part of the agreement basically releases you from legal liability. So, this way you know that you can safely use other people's content, because if you don't, then you run into a bigger legal issue dealing with copyright violation or any other kind of privacy violations, and so forth.

[00:10:53.830] - Amira
So, you protect yourself and prevent yourself from these legal troubles by using a media release agreement.

[00:11:00.660] - Liz
Yes. Every single speaker of the summit had to sign a speaker release, so. And I've always done that every year. And this past summer, I actually got, so it turned out to be like a prank or whatever. Someone impersonating a speaker, saying they were suing me for not paying them.

[00:11:18.700] - Amira
Oh, my God. 

[00:11:19.650] - Liz
So, I reached out to the speaker directly. I was like, first of all, this doesn't sound like you, and I know you've had some of these issues, So, A, is this you?. B, here's the contract, and like, you know. So, I was like, I know it's covered, but it's still stressful. So, you want these things regardless. So, yeah, yeah.

[00:11:37.240] - Amira
Yeah, no, absolutely. It's crazy, right? Because anything can happen in the online space. So, yeah, you have to protect yourself.

[00:11:44.650] - Liz
Yeah, it's a little bit of a wild west in a lot of ways still, because a lot of you know laws just are trying to catch up.

[00:11:52.090] - Amira
That's true. That's true.

[00:11:54.340] - Liz
Okay, we've covered independent contractor agreement. We've covered terms and conditions for products and services, covered a generalized media release. What's next?

[00:12:04.160] - Amira
So, this one, the fourth one is also kind of tied into the media release. But this is a little bit on a different level. This one has to do with guest blogger agreement. So, anytime that you're accepting guest posts on your site, which as bloggers, we do all the time, I mean, I accept guest posts on my website. And so, this is a great way for you to build traffic to your site, also build relationship with fellow bloggers and so forth. But again, anytime you're having these kinds of relationships, you want to protect them. So, this is the type of contract that where a guest blogger gives you, the site owner, the legal rights to be able to use their content, whatever that they put together for you, it may be images also included in the guest post, also the videos that they're giving you. So, you just want to make sure that you have all of that done legally. So, when you accept those, you know those guest posts, that's already done for you. And also, you could include your guest post guidelines as part of this contract. So, this way, someone submitting the guest post to you will also have a clear understanding of what are your site rules.

[00:13:06.570] - Amira
Right? What is it that you allow? Maybe you allow one do follow link, or maybe you allow don't, and sometimes you might even want to get compensated. So that is also something that you have the option of including in this agreement. Like, some of my customers have actually said that, hey, I'm paying for a guest post, so I want to be able to have that compensation provision in there, which, you know so you could add all of those things as well. And again, this just protects you from any kind of intellectual property or copyright law violations and so forth before you start putting that content, which is prepared by a third party on your website.

[00:13:45.190] - Liz
Yeah, I mean, because most often I say guest posts aren't money isn't typically exchanged. That's where freelancer is where you're getting sponsored content. But for guest posts, like, you don't want to be liable if they plagarized, or if they stole an image, or you know. And I'm embarrassed to say I don't know if I've ever really done a guest post agreement granted, I haven't guest posted really in years, you know, so like. I started blogging in 2014, but I've always had email right, and be used as a contract, but it's not the best. So, yeah, definitely. And those are things I never even really thought about because I didn't do images and stuff like that and I wrote my content, right, you know. But the stuff you always, especially if you don't know the blogger well, even if you do, you want those things, but it's far less likely to lead to issues when you have that in place.

[00:14:44.230] - Amira
Right. And it just also includes things that you don't think about, such as your legal right to edit the guest post, you know. Maybe you want to make some edits to the actual content received before you publish it on your site, so you want to include all those terms. So, this way there's no confusion between you and the guest blogger and it just maintains the relationship, especially if it's like maybe you have some sort of an arrangement where the person is giving, maybe it's an agency or something, right? Like they're giving you four guest post per a month. And that does happen. And I do have bloggers that have that kind of arrangement, so it just varies from situation to situation. And it's just a good idea to have some sort of, like terms and conditions of your guest logging arrangement outlined and nicely put together on your site to make the whole process move and efficient.

[00:15:31.050] - Liz
Yes, I do have that on my site, though. I will say that. Which is why a lot of people don't end up making it through because they said I was like, this isn't even like my requirements for pitch, so.

[00:15:41.830] - Amira
Yeah.

[00:15:42.210] - Liz
I can do more and one less thing off my plate to have to deal with.

[00:15:48.260] - Amira
Yeah, exactly.

[00:15:48.530] - Liz
All right. So, we kind of touched on it. I don't know if this is on your list, but sponsored post, sponsorship in general, right, doesn't necessarily post. I'm working with sponsors for like the first time ever, really. I've never done sponsor. I've done two sponsorships in the like, what?

[00:16:06.150] - Amira
Oh, aren't they so exciting, though?

[00:16:08.490] - Liz
It is, yeah. So, I've got sponsors for the Summit this year. You guys will have seen them, you know, as you're watching this, but I was like, I got to get a contract together, you know. So, what are some of the things that's involved in that and terms you would want to make sure to touch upon.

[00:16:25.000] - Amira
Yeah, absolutely. So, sponsorships are like really one of the fun parts of blogging, I feel, because I've also started doing sponsorships and I absolutely love it. So, first of all, what exactly is sponsorship, right?

[00:16:37.180] - Amira
Sponsorship is when the brands actually pay you to create sponsored content, meaning create content for them, which in turn also gains them visibility and exposure. And then if you have some sort of like followers or email list or traffic to your site, or maybe you're creating videos, then you again bringing more traffic to their product or service that you are promoting, right? So that's essentially what it is where they're paying you to create that content. Now, that content could be a blog post. It could be just simply sharing it on your email list and newsletter blast. It could be even creating a video, which is exactly what I did not too long ago. I created a, video, a sponsored video. So it could be multiple different ways that you work with brands or simply posting on social media. Like if you have a lot of followers on Instagram, that's another sponsorship that I have done too, where I have shared some products on Instagram and I was paid for them. So that's one of the things that, you know, it's really exciting to be able to work with brands and to get that kind of money to be able to create the content.

[00:17:39.250] - Amira
But there are some legalities associated with that. First of all, under the Federal Trade Commission rules, you do have to give what's called a sponsorship disclaimer, right, disclosure. And you have to let people know that, hey, you were compensated for this. So, if it's a blog post, you're going to need a sponsorship disclosure in there that's going to say something along the lines that, hey, I was paid to write this blog post, however the views or opinions on my own, or whatever the case may be. But you do need to put people on notice letting them know that you were paid for it. Same thing for the video. Like if the video you do have to give, that's kind of the same thing as what we do with affiliate links, right? When we share affiliate links, we have to give those mandatory disclosures to comply with the law. So that's one thing to keep in mind. The second thing is, you know as part of this agreement, it's really, really important to have one. Most of the time the companies will just have their own agreement, but there will be times that you're working with maybe a newer company or they don't have an agreement and they'll say to you to provide the agreement to them.

[00:18:40.500] - Amira
Then in those cases, you would need what's called the sponsorship agreement or sponsor force agreement. And this way you can provide them the contract. You can fill in the information such as, you know how many posts, how many blog posts, details as to like, okay, when will you have this content created by, what are the payment terms, will you be paid upfront or will you be paid afterwards by, you know, all kinds of stuff, maybe even a late penalty thing, or also, like, how long will this content stay on your website? Because if you're writing a boss, you don't want to be like, giving them forever rights, right? So, you kind of want to reserve the right. Maybe after a year they pay you another fee or something. So, you want to negotiate all the terms before with the brand and then kind of nicely add them all into the sponsored agreement to make sure that both parties are on the same page.

[00:19:32.340] - Liz
Yeah, and I did just want to throw in there. Payment doesn't necessarily have to be cash. If it was a great product that still counts and you need to disclose that and then don't be afraid to negotiate. It's really funny because I think you think, oh, these are big brands. Like, I don't want to you know negotiate, but a lot of times the person you're dealing with is like, totally fine with there. They're like, that's okay, let me just double check, you know like. Like, there's a point person, but they're not necessarily the like and all the all, and they're happy to negotiate, so don't be afraid to ask for what you want.

[00:20:06.720] - Amira
Yeah. And another pro tip is that you don't have to be the first one to give them your number. You can always ask them, what's their budget? Right? So, this way you kind of find out where do they stand and then from there start the whole negotiation process for however long your time is going to take or what the commitment looks like. So, there are many different ways to negotiate, but yes, I totally agree with you, Liz. Like, never just settle with the first offer that you get because you're short changing yourself that way.

[00:20:32.370] - Liz
Yeah. Yeah. And really look over any agreements they send you. So, I want to add back when I was freelancing, like, I was like, this is missing a page, right? Like a jump from like, page seven to page nine and reference causes in there. And I was like I was like, I'm not signing this, you know. And then she's like, I don't understand. I was like, no, it's literally missing a page. Like a page didn't get scared. Like, it took me like, five emails and then finally they're like, oh, we need to go ask legal to get the right contract, because they just didn't even realize, you know? So, yeah, just keep in mind, make sure you really read carefully. Okay, so that's five we covered. What is the sixth one that you want to touch on?

[00:21:13.720] - Amira
Right? So this is the last one, but not the least. There's so many. But this is the one that I also want you guys to remember, especially if you have an affiliate program for your products, then definitely make sure that you use what's called an affiliate agreement. There are so many different names for it. Affiliate terms and conditions, affiliate program agreement. Essentially, these are the terms and conditions that are regarding your affiliate program, so that you and your affiliates are promoting your products legally, and that they're also understanding what's the commission, what's the cookie period for your affiliate links, and just all the different terms of your agreement, right? So, you might want to restrict them from promoting your product a certain way, or you might want to give them certain legal rights, such as, oh, you can use our images, and so forth. So that's why it's really important to make sure that your affiliates are doing things the right way and the way that you want them to. And that's the whole goal of this agreement. So, make sure that before you start having affiliates, which is a great way to, of course, grow your network and have people promote your products, but just make sure that you have affiliate terms and conditions, affiliate agreement in place with them.

[00:22:26.200] - Amira
And till this day, I get emails like, okay, I have obviously one, but till this day, I will get an email about like, well, I didn't receive this payment. You know, I'm like, well, as per our terms, payment is not due until 30 days, blah, blah, blah, you know. So these are the kind of things that you can easily refer them back to. Imagine if I didn't have an agreement and then somebody asked me and they would get upset with me because they would think that I'm not giving them their commission. But that's not the case. That's just our policy, right? So that's why it's so important to outline those policies. Maybe you want to have a period of 30 days before you release payment to your affiliates, which is a good idea, in case there's any chance of refund or any kind of thing. So, you need to outline that in your affiliate agreement. So, this way, your affiliates know when to accept payment, otherwise you're upsetting them.

[00:23:14.610] - Liz
Yeah, and you don't upset affiliates. And just a pro tip, I would say, is have the affiliate agreement or terms, whatever you're calling it, easily accessible to affiliate. So, you know have it in with the affiliate materials of like, hey, if you're curious about the cookie period, if you don't know, you know, here's this, and I see this even like, you know, I'm an affiliate for products. Yes, I'm an affiliate program, you know, but I'm an affiliate for products, and I don't even know where to start. Like, I saw it when I signed up. I don't know where it is now, you know. So, I would just say, it's extremely helpful to your affiliates if you make that easily accessible, it's helpful to you because then you're getting less emails.

[00:23:52.390] - Amira
Yeah. You're getting less questions, and that's exactly right. Exactly. That's very true. And it just makes it easier for the affiliates to be able to see. And like I said, there are some affiliates that will impose certain conditions. For example, I remember when one of the products that I was promoting, it was a course that I had taken. So, I was like, oh, great, they have an affiliate program, so I'm going to promote this. But good thing I read their affiliate terms being a lawyer, I mean, this is fun stuff for us, but maybe not for someone who is not a lawyer. But if I didn't read it, I would eventually violated their rules because as part of their affiliate terms and conditions, they prohibited you from, for whatever reason, promoting it on Pinterest. And I don't know why, but they did. They prohibited that. So, good thing I read those terms and I'm like, okay, I can't create a Pin about this or I can't do this or I didn't promote them on Pinterest, but I did promote them, like in a blog post, which they did allow. So, again, every program or every creator is unique in their own way, so there might be certain restrictions and conditions that they would add into their program, which you won't expect to know unless you actually glance through them and review it to make sure that you're abiding by their rules and regulations.

[00:25:05.810] - Liz
Yes, okay. And just to recap for everyone, we talked about independent contractor agreements, we talked about product and services terms and conditions. We talked about media release, guest post agreement, sponsorship agreements, and affiliate program agreement or terms and conditions. Any final tips on contracts that you think they should know?

[00:25:24.240] - Amira
Yeah. So, contracts to me are honestly the backbone of your business because, again, speaking from experience, anything can, this is such an easy tool at your disposal. They don't take a lot of work. You can easily you know get contract templates from lawyers, and then you can just put it all together for you. So I feel like it's a no brainer to use contracts to protect the relationship that you're building with other people while working in your business. And no matter what kind of business that you're creating, you're going to need help at any point in your business. So, it is a wise idea to always protect your interest, but also make sure that the other party fully understands how it is by working with you. And it just honestly makes you look like a professional when you have a good contract that you're using. And I would also caution against using free legal templates. A lot of people think that I can just Google a contract and I can just take something from online and that's good enough. It's not always the case because as a lawyer who has audited free legal templates, I always find them to have loopholes.

[00:26:28.930] - Amira
And I'm sure, Liz, you would agree with me on this that free is free for a reason, you know. It's not like it is comprehensive enough. It's not going to always protect you for different scenarios. And you might be looking for something particular that the free one is never going to, you know it's not going to give you all of those legal protections, and you don't even know what the things that are missing in there, who put together the free one, you know it could lead to also copyright violations too, because it's not necessarily written by a lawyer or anything. So, I would always say that play it safe when it comes to your business. You are building a business. They'll make sure that you cover yourself and protect it.

[00:27:08.490] - Liz
Okay, and where can people, anywhere you want to send people in particular?

[00:27:14.660] - Amira
Okay. Yeah. So, I would love for you to, I know we talk about contracts today, but I would love for you to also download my free legal guide that I put together, which walks you through some of the common legal mistakes that I see bloggers and entrepreneurs making. And that's available on my website at aselfguru.com. And if you need any help with any of these contracts as well, then I also have legal templates for that as well. And then there's my YouTube channel where I'm concentrating right now. So, I would love for you to subscribe and reach out if you have any questions.

[00:27:46.910] - Liz
Yes, definitely check her out. And I think you are contributing something to the all access pass as well. Do you want to tell us about that?

[00:27:53.010] - Amira
Yeah, absolutely. So, I am giving away an ebook which has to do with 23 legal mistakes that I see entrepreneurs making. And I also walk you through the actual ways that you can avoid those mistakes. So, there's so many different things that could go wrong in your online business that you may not realize. So, this is a book where I walk you through all the different ways that you can protect yourself in different areas to make sure that your business is safe and protected.

[00:28:23.210] - Liz

Hi, guys. Welcome to this video lesson on the five easy ways to legally protect your digital products. So, whenever there's someone who sets up a coaching call or an online business consult with me or even in my Facebook group, do you know the most important question or the common question I get is about digital products? Like, they will always ask me how to protect their digital products, whether it's crafts, printables, ebooks, coloring books, courses, templates, or anything else. So, this video lesson is going to be super helpful for you if you also would like to learn more. Now, before we get started, if there's nothing else you remember from today's lesson, I want you guys to remember that legal is the glue that holds your business together. And I put together this quote myself because I watched my own dad's business get sued for $90,000, and it could have been avoided if my dad had used a proper legal contract with the person that he had hired. So that's why I became a lawyer because I wanted to help other entrepreneurs like my dad avoid making legal mistakes. Stay tuned till the very end of this lesson because I have a free legal guide as a gift for you, which I will show you how to grab.

[00:01:26.190] - Amira Irfan
Now, a little bit about me. My name is Amira Irfan. I'm the business lawyer, entrepreneur, and coach behind aselfguru.com. You can learn more about me by simply visiting my website right here aselfguru.com. I've had the honor of being featured on more than 200-plus media outlets, and also I've helped 50,000 some entrepreneurs in my 13-plus years of working as a lawyer. I'm also really honored to have 200-plus five -- five-star customer reviews, and it just warms my heart and makes this whole process and this whole business worthwhile when we receive a customer love note which we do very frequently. So I started my online business while working full-time as a lawyer, and now I basically coach other entrepreneurs and show you guys how to keep your business legal and how to make money online. And this is me on TV, on Ticker News, also sharing the five things to keep businesses safe online. Now, raise your hand if you've ever felt confused, frustrated, or intimidated by the legal side of your business and you have no idea how to legally protect your digital products or business. You're not alone. This is why I put together this lesson because you will learn the five easy ways to legally protect your digital products.

[00:02:42.740] - Amira Irfan
We're going to cover important things like a privacy policy, why it's a must, a digital piracy which is what it is, and copyright law, copyright notice that you should be giving in your digital products, disclosures, disclaimers, terms and conditions for your digital product, and some bonus legal tips like having to do with Americans with Disabilities Act and how to ensure compliance, whether it's your website or your digital products. And then kind of the reasons why you need to have all these documents in place and some common legal misconceptions. And last but not least, I will show you how to create these legal documents by using legal templates that I've put together to give you complete protection and peace of mind. Now, why is this important? Well, obviously to avoid lawsuits, right? Because it's really disturbing that according to the small business administration survey 53 percent of businesses' owner -- business owners face a lawsuit every year, and I believe that because, you know, I saw my dad's business get sued. I've been working as a lawyer for over a decade, and I've seen so many hundreds and thousands of entrepreneurs getting into legal issues. So, it's very disturbing that about approximately 12 million lawsuits are filed against small business owners. In a typical liability lawsuit will cost you more than $50,000.

[00:04:03.780] - Amira Irfan
And in our case, it cost my dad $90,000. So, it's so important for you to take legal steps and have the information to protect yourself and anything that you create. Now, I also have to give you my legal disclaimer. We'll kind of go into disclaimers a little bit later in the lesson the why they're so important. But all of the information that I'm going to share is for your informational -- educational purposes only. It doesn't constitute legal advice. Even though I'm a lawyer, I'm not your lawyer. So let's now, right, get into the actual lessons. Right? So also, I'm going to cover some mistakes that you should avoid. The first mistake that I see a lot of entrepreneurs making with their digital business is not having a privacy policy on their website or on the sales page that they're using to sell digital goods or products. So, a privacy policy is a legal page that informs the people who purchase from you, your customers or the people that visit your site, what information you will collect from them and how you're going to use it. So, for example, I sell legal templates. So, in order for me to sell that digital product, I need your name, your email address, your credit card information. Right?  

[00:05:19.980] - Amira Irfan
So, in other words, all of that stuff that I'm collecting from you is considered personal information. So, the law says that I must now give you a privacy statement, a notice, letting you know what I'm going to do with that information. Otherwise, you risk getting into audits, fines by the Federal Trade Commission. I've also shared some examples that if you just simply click on their website, you will see all these small to big business owners that have gotten in legal trouble for not complying with the different privacy laws out there. So there's quite a few to worry about, but in a nutshell, you know, we have the toughest privacy law in the world which is general data protection regulation, GDPR, that we all have to comply with whether we're in the European Union or not, and there are serious hefty penalties for noncompliance. We're talking millions of dollars or four percent of your revenue. We also have a recent regulation, California Consumer Privacy Act. So, if you have customers from California purchasing from you, or you have -- just simply even have visitors from California visiting your website, for example, then you need to give them special rights that they're afforded under the law.

[00:06:30.310] - Amira Irfan
Otherwise, you also risk getting fined or sued for more than thousands of dollars here. So, the takeaway here is and the common question I get is, like, where do I post the privacy policy? Well, if you have a website, post it on your site and in the footer section of your website. And if you have a sales page for your product, then definitely post it in the sales -- on the sales page in the footer section. Now, let's talk about digital privacy and copyright law. So under the US law, copyright protection is automatic. So, it means that any time you create a product, a digital or physical in a tangible form, you have right away copyright protection. And you can take legal action against someone who infringes upon your work or uses it without your authorization, right. So, if you register with the copyright office, then that gives you some more protection because now you can sue the person, the infringer, for damages and get lots of money. So, for example, let's say you created a craft, right, or something that you can file for copyright protection and protect it from unauthorized, you know, copying or use. Now, what is digital piracy? So it's a really common issue obviously where, you know, someone will steal your content, someone will use your product.

[00:07:53.180] - Amira Irfan
So, in other words, if someone is unauthorized and they're using your copyright materials, whether it's your crafts, your printables, your music, your films, your software, anything else that you created without your permission. They're copying it, they're stealing it, or even distributing it or selling it, again, that all kind of runs into all of those violations, right. So, for example, I sell legal templates. Since they're my original work, they are protected under copyright law automatically from the time that I created them. So, in other words, you cannot copy them without my permission. Now, if you do, then you obviously risk facing a copyright infringement lawsuit and you will end up paying a lot of legal damages. So by -- so another thing is that why -- when somebody purchases from you, you can give them a license to use that product however they wish, or you can put some restrictions on it. So, for example, if someone purchases the legal templates from me, then they get the one license to use that template for their particular business, and then that doesn't result in copyright infringement. So I just wanted to clarify that that as the copyright owner, you can give legal rights to how you want your product or your, you know, specific services even to be used by others.

[00:09:09.110] - Amira Irfan
And the other thing you have to do is, well before we get into that, let's quickly talk about what's protected under copyright law because that's another common question I get. So a lot of different things are protected. So, anything in the original work of authorship is protected, so we're talking books, blog posts, scripts, poems, musical compositions, paintings, drawings, industrial designs, computer software. Now, another thing to keep in mind is that when it comes to crafts, it's important to remember that it does not protect the functional object, but only the artistic expression, the design, right. So, for example, you could have a T-shirt and there's a design that you created it's unique and you didn't copy anybody else, then that's protected under copyright, but the T-shirt itself is not, okay. So, copyright also does not protect ideas, names or titles or slogans or short phrases for the titles and the names and things like that. You need trademark protection. Now, another common question I get is, can I sell things with popular characters on it such as Disney, right, or any of the other characters? Well, no, that's a big, big, big no. Do not sell crafts that feature any other person's character, image or logo without first reviewing their intellectual property terms and condition.

[00:10:31.390] - Amira Irfan
So all of these copyright owners, they get to decide how they want their products to be used and they'll have their own terms and condition. So, you never want to assume that you could just use them. Don't use Disney's logos or images, for example. I'll even share a lawsuit where Disney is pursuing a business owner for using their stuff. So make sure that all your designs that are -- that you are creating are original works, right. You're not using someone else's photos, graphic design elements, or copying another artwork. Also, if you're selling on Etsy, for example, then Etsy will also take this stuff very seriously. They will remove or ban you if you sell a product that infringes upon somebody else's intellectual property. So as a matter of fact, I had somebody who had set up a call with me last week and she was selling on Etsy and she had faced that situation, but she also wanted to know how she could avoid copyright infringement and how she could get legal rights to use somebody else's intellectual property. So, this thing came up very recently and that if you're also wondering the same thing, then this is what you would need. You would need what's called a licensed agreement.

[00:11:43.600] - Amira Irfan
So, let's say you wanted to use somebody else's design or an element of a design or anything like a photo, logos, or you know, videos even, you would use what's called a license agreement to obtain legal rights to use somebody else's intellectual property. You may have to pay them a fee or may not, depending on your negotiations. So I have that template in my legal store if you would like to get it in case you need that. And also, if you're not sure about any of this stuff, always you can book a call with me and I'm happy to guide you. Because I know that when it comes to intellectual property, it can be complicated and it's not always easy to understand another party's terms and conditions. A lot of times people will book a call with me because they're not clear about like, hey, can I use this website's photos a certain way or can I do this or can I not do that? And that's where a lawyer can really help because we review these things day in, day out and I can guide you as to what you can and cannot do. Now, what happens if somebody steals your content?

[00:12:44.630] - Amira Irfan
So you have couple of options. The first is you can send them a cease and desist letter that will basically make it very clear to them that they violated, violated your copyright and then you give them the opportunity to take that content down and remove it. Right? So, if you need that template, I give it to you for free. If you simply visit the freebies page on my website, you can download that template absolutely free because I know that that's an issue that can come up sometimes. The other thing is if it's a website, for example, that's copied your content, you can also do what's called the DMCA takedown notice. So, there's you know, a copyright act -- a Digital Millennium Copyright Act that allows you to contact the online service provider, such as the website host or search engine, and let them know that your copyright material has been infringed upon. You would provide some information, like right here, the name, the URL, the proof, and then the service provider will then take the necessary steps to get that content removed from the website. Now, another mistake that you want to avoid as a creator, right, so if you have a digital product, it's your legal responsibility to put people on notice, letting them know that, hey, they can't copy your stuff.

[00:14:02.680] - Amira Irfan
Don't assume somebody to just, like, right away know all this stuff because not everybody understands copyright law. So, you must give what's called a copyright notice in your digital product. So, you should have a copyright page. It's an absolute necessity. It basically tells your customers, your readers, if you have a website, that you are the sole owner of your work that you're sharing that they're not permitted to reuse or publish it without your explicit written consent. So this stops people from copying your digital products and profiting from your hard work. And now another common question I get is what to include or how to write this language or what language do I need to post, right. So I've given you an example. So this is how the language would look. You would have the copyright notice itself, right, and then the symbol, the publication year, your -- the business name, and if you -- the all rights reserved statement right here which explains that they cannot reproduce the work as their own. And if it's a book, for example, you want to also include the ISBN number, any other legal permissions or rights that you're giving to them, your trademark notice if you have a trademark, and then your contact information.

[00:15:16.650] - Amira Irfan
So, let's say somebody does want to use your information or somebody does want to use your design, at least give them the opportunity very clearly in that copyright notice to, to be able to contact you by email and so forth. So this is like the very basic language. The bonus legal tip I have for you is use watermarks. So this is another good way to protect your digital products and it will make it harder for somebody to steal your work because they won't be able to use it without the watermark. And this just kind of, you know, prevents other people from copying your work without your permission. Now, the third mistake that you want to avoid, and I see some entrepreneurs making, is that not having a disclaimer to limit your legal liability. Remember how we started this video lesson with me giving my legal disclaimer to you guys? Same thing so no matter what content that you're sharing. You should always have a disclaimer page to limit your legal liability. If it's your website or if it's your digital products, it basically lets people know, your customers or your readers, like what information -- anything that they're getting out of that product is at their own risk, right.

[00:16:28.730] - Amira Irfan
So, this way what happens is that if somebody relies on the information that you're sharing and they suffer a negative consequence, they can come after you for legal damages. It could be like, for example, an affiliate product that you're recommending where you're earning a commission. It's a third-party product. The next thing you know somebody doesn't like that product or it -- or there's a harm or some negative consequence to that person they can come after you for legal damages if you don't have these disclaimers in place. So, make sure to tailor it to your niche. And also, under the Federal Trade Commission rules, you must disclose your affiliate relationships, right. So, you are legally required to, you know, give what's called an affiliate disclosure if you are going to be sharing affiliate links. Sometimes, you know, you create a course or you create an ebook and you want to share all these helpful affiliate products, you know, so what you want to do is you always need to give an affiliate disclosure. And here's a sample language that you're welcome to use. So, if it's, for example, a printable course or ebook and you're sharing affiliate links where you're going to earn a commission from you need to let people know that, hey I will earn a small commission if you purchase through my link,

[00:17:39.310] - Amira Irfan
please see full disclosure for more information. And this is where if you have a website, you need to link to the full disclaimer page on your website so that people can read the whole policy. So, if you don't have a disclaimer or disclosure, then once again, you could get sued. You could get audited, fined by the Federal Trade Commission, and this has happened frequently to a lot of people, so make sure you follow the rules. And also, you know, if you don't give a disclaimer, then you're just honestly opening yourself to bad possibilities, right, because there's no reason not to include one. And specially, it makes you look like a professional because you'd be surprised, like, so many times, like, it gives me so much joy when I'm doing a website legal audit for a customer. And, and at the same time, it breaks my heart when I'm doing this audit and I see absolutely no disclaimer, and then other times I will see a disclaimer, but it needs a little more work, so that's where I can help you. But if you have nothing, then obviously I have to give you the whole template. But it's just, you know, it's just something that you just want to avoid, right. Like, you want to make sure from the very beginning do things the right way. Look like a professional, not an amateur who doesn't take his work or her work seriously.

[00:18:51.350] - Amira Irfan
So, make sure that you always have a disclosure -- disclaimer statement. Then you can have it all on one page. So next thing is that, do I need a disclaimer on my website and in my digital products? So, yes. If you have a website, you should always have it on your site and also in your digital products. And in addition to that, if you have affiliate links that you're sharing, then you need to give the affiliate disclosures as well. Now, any questions so far you're welcome to let me know or reach out. So the next mistake I want to talk about is, and this one is really important and pay attention, please, is not having terms and conditions for your digital products. So terms and conditions are a legal contract with your customers. So, guys, take them seriously and they will help you prevent all kinds of situations. They will help you fight chargeback situations. They will -- they're like your best friend. Okay. So they're also referred to as terms of use, terms of service, and user agreement. If you're selling digital products such as software, artwork, photographs, anything, crafts, anything, it's important to use what's called end-user-license agreement. So this -- these agreements let your customers know how they can use your product, and they also protect against unauthorized use or distribution.

[00:20:08.990] - Amira Irfan
They also protect your intellectual property from being stolen, and this is the area where you include the governing law provisions, like where and how legal disputes will be resolved. So sometimes, you know, somebody could get -- you could get into an ugly dispute with a customer over your refund policy. You want to be able to let them know where -- which laws are going to govern, right, and this legal page also outlines your refund exchange policies. So keep in mind that without proper terms and conditions on your site, you have no legal recourse if there is a dispute between you and your customer. They're important to avoid legal disputes, protect your intellectual property from being stolen, clearly outline the expectations of both parties, and avoid refunds and exchanges. So I'll give you another example. So in my terms and conditions, since I have my customers who can become affiliates and earn a generous 40% commission, I make it very clear to my customers or my affiliates in my terms and conditions that they're allowed to use my photos, but my product photos only strictly for the affiliate marketing purposes. So, these are the kind of things that legal rights or grants that you can give, right, and every business is unique. You may allow your customers to use your product a certain way.

[00:21:23.880] - Amira Irfan
You may allow them to print them but not sell them, whatever it may be, you can kind of have a custom-tailored, you know, terms and conditions where your customers are very clear about what they can or cannot do. The next most important step, and this is another one that entrepreneurs often miss, is that it's not enough to just have these terms and conditions you also need to have your customers click to accept them before they make a purchase from you. So that -- here's a sample of what that looks like. So, in other words, at the checkout process, you would have them click here to accept your terms and conditions in order to be legally bound. And again, you can use this later on as evidence to fight a chargeback situation or anything else, but you need this. Now, bonus legal tip, if you have a website or you have digital products like videos where you -- you know, courses or anything like that, you want to always make sure that you're making them accessible to people with disabilities, right. So, whether it's the Americans with Disabilities Act, the ADA or international accessibility laws, they basically tell you that you cannot discriminate against people with disabilities, so you want to make sure your content is meeting dual standards.

[00:22:36.100] - Amira Irfan
These are international standards and guidelines that we all have to comply with and unfortunately, in the last couple of years as a lawyer, I've seen a huge, like double the amount of lawsuits being brought against people and business owners and website owners that just simply don't comply with this law and they don't make any effort to make their products or their site accessible. So, you want to avoid all of them. Just make sure that your product, like if it's a video, add captions. If it's like a picture, you know, add the alt text on your site, things like that, but those are just scratching the surface. Again, to learn more simply, you know, visit my site where I kind of walk you through more information. Now, to recap, you need all these legal protections. Why? Because number one, to avoid lawsuits. Comply with the laws whether it's privacy laws, federal trade commission laws, you know. To protect your intellectual property, outline your terms and conditions for how your product should be used, disclose affiliate relationships and as I keep referring back to this theme of looking like a professional and being a professional, right. So now let's talk about some legal misconceptions that people have. Sometimes I hear, I'm not making any money from my business, so I don't need a privacy policy.

[00:23:50.390] - Amira Irfan
Listen, guys, the law doesn't differentiate between you making money or not making money just like taxes, right. Like, we all have to pay taxes. So, it's the same concept here. So, you need a privacy policy on your site for your digital products, whether you are making money or not. That's just a legal requirement that you have to fulfill. Otherwise, you risk getting into legal trouble, and we shared those cases with you here. The second thing is like, I'm just a small fish, who's going to sue me? That's another big misconception. Because I'll again, refer back to my dad's story, because it's near and dear to my heart. He got sued when he was only in his second year of business. He wasn't even making $90,000 when he got sued for $90,000 and his personal assets were at risk. So, you know, the law -- so again, lawsuits come in all shapes and sizes. Even the last lawsuit, when I was working for my law firm, we helped settle a client for half a million dollars because our intellectual property was compromised, again, used by somebody else. Same situations that we just covered, and we had to go after and sue the infringer, infringer for copyright infringement. Another client I know, she made the legal mistake of just grabbing an image from Google and posting it on her site, and guess what?

[00:25:06.420] - Amira Irfan
She ended up paying $8,000 in damages for that. Another one paid like $5,000 because she didn't have a refund or exchange policy and the -- her customer and her got into a really nasty legal dispute. And here's another example of Disney, you know, they're cracking down on copyright infringement, so they are also going after a business owner who basically copied, you know, they started selling like mouse-eared, and other Disney items on Etsy, eBay, Amazon. So again, you just never ever know when you get into a legal problem. So, how do you create legal documents? So first thing is that you could always work with a lawyer like me. This is one of the services that I offer. We write a custom privacy policy terms and conditions for your products, your disclaimers that you need, copyright notice disclaimers, anything that you need basically tailored to your specific business to give you complete peace of mind. The second option, which you can also do is you could purchase legal templates from a lawyer, right. So I also sell legal templates. You have that option. You could easily grab my copyright notice disclaimer template for digital products and get the same lawyer-level protection without the hefty legal fees, so you have both options.

**Transcript:**
Liz Stapleton [00:00:00]:
Hey, guys. Today, I'm super excited for this session with Jamie Lieberman from Hashtag Legal. She is a lawyer. who's been helping bloggers figure out the legal side of stuff for years, and I've seen her speaking at conferences. She's fantastic, so I'm really excited to have her. Thank you for coming.

Jamie Lieberman [00:00:15]:
Thanks for having me. So I'm very excited to be here. I do wanna say at first before we start anything. This is not legal advice. This is just information and opinion, if you do need legal advice that I recommend that you speak to an attorney about your specific business.

Liz Stapleton [00:00:31]:
Yes. because as we were talking before we hit report is the legal side of stuff is just people don't think about it, and it's so grossly, like, underrepresented. in this sort of business, and particularly, I think the people the stuff that scares people the most is what we're gonna talk about today's trademarks and copyright.

Jamie Lieberman [00:00:52]:
I think that's right.

Liz Stapleton [00:00:55]:
And I think copyright's usually the more approachable topics, and maybe we'll start there because people have a better idea of what that is. It's like don't steal images. You don't want people stealing yours, but there's a little more to it. Can you just I'm gonna let you maybe intro that topic for us.

Jamie Lieberman [00:01:10]:
Yeah. You got it. I do. It's so funny. I just had a phone call today with someone who was like, can you just tell me the difference? And so That's perfect. It is a very commonly asked question. So copyright, the way that I like to explain copyright is all about what you're creating. and so it's an original work of some kind. And so I always like to say original work of art. It doesn't mean art like the Mona Lisa, It just means something that you've created. An original also doesn't have to be mean, Mona Lisa as well, but what that just means is you created it yourself. So if I'm looking at out my window and I see a stop sign and I take a picture of it, that image is copyright protected as soon as I take it. the so it's any work of art. So it could be a book, a blog post, an image. it could be graphic. Exactly. It could be as a a principle that you create. and the important thing to remember is it's not the idea that is copyright protected. but it is actually the way that you, show that idea. So the way that you put it on paper, a really common way to talk about this is through recipes. so many people know and sort of, like, one of those facts on the back of your head that recipes are not copyright protected. And that's just because it's just a listing of ingredients. However, how you present that recipe, your images, how you talk about it. The story that you may talk about. If your grandmother made this chicken soup that you're talking about, that can all be copyright protected. And even a cookbook, the way that you arrange your recipes can be copyright protected. so it's important to remember it's not an idea, but actually how you've presented that idea and put that idea down. yeah, published. Exactly. Yes. That's exactly right.

Liz Stapleton [00:02:52]:
Yeah. because I know I had that problem. Someone was stealing my Instagram and images, and then he's reposts to do it. And I was like, well, now I know you're stealing them. Take them down. It's a violation of copyright. It does nothing for me. You know, I don't care if that's common practice, and she she took them down. but who knows how many more she's stole.

Jamie Lieberman [00:03:09]:
-- I I get those questions a lot because so many people repost images. And I said, honestly, that is copy likely copyright infringement unless you've gotten permission of some kind. It's just everybody does it.

Liz Stapleton [00:03:20]:
Yes. Yes. you can if you see someone doing that, it's your step. You can you can step in. You're, you know, and people when I told them about this, they looked at Instagram, and I was, like, in in their terms of service. Yeah. It's copyright.

Jamie Lieberman [00:03:32]:
Yeah. There's a reason that Instagram doesn't have the functionality to let you share that image to your feed. because it is potentially copyright infringement, and it's important to protect your intellectual property.

Liz Stapleton [00:03:45]:
Absolutely. And so I think another people get people get confused about most popular is they're like, do I have to register it? So do they and it I know the answer. So I'll let you answer, and then we'll dig into when or why they might or how. Yeah.

Jamie Lieberman [00:04:01]:
So the answer is to have copyright protection. You do not need to register it. However, registration gives you some really great benefits. so the minute that you create that work so I'm gonna use a picture We'll use it on our Instagram feed. The minute I take that picture, I have what's called a common law copyright protection. And common law just means that it's created by the court system versus being created by a statute because there is a copyright act, and that is boring stuff that no one cares but you get common law copyright protection, and that means that somebody can't use it. They can't take it. They can't steal it. They can't do other things with it. And with that copyright comes and you'll probably remember this from law school, the bundle of sticks, which always makes me laugh. because in law school, for some reason, they The law school professors like to talk about the bundle of rights that you get like a like an actual bundle of sticks.

Liz Stapleton [00:04:54]:
Yeah.

Jamie Lieberman [00:04:55]:
and there's all these rights that you get with owning a copyright, the right to display it, the right to perform it, the right to distribute it, and the really important right, which a lot of people should know this term of art is the right to create a derivative work. and we'll talk about what that means, but there's all these rights you have copyright and you own all of them when you create that work. And it's up to you to be able to know what to do with it. You can give it away. You can sell it. You can keep it for yourself. You can choose to give away one of them, which is why you give one of your sticks away. So, for example, I can give somebody permission to display my work but I won't give them the permission to distribute it, or, like, commercially or to create a derivative work. Okay.

Liz Stapleton [00:05:37]:
I just wanna pause there. It's a really good point in terms of stock photos you purchase is sometimes you're able to use it for, like, social media graphics, but you're not able to use it for commercial purposes. So, like, in, like, a digital product you create.

Jamie Lieberman [00:05:49]:
That's exactly right. And all the language that we're talking about is licensing. So this is all licensing. So the rights that you have in your copyright are essentially what you can give away or sell. When you give them away, you give them away. You've given permission. When you sell them, that's called a license, if you fully sell every single right, that's a work made for hire. So that's a term you should know about. If you see it in a contract and it says work for hire, it means you will have no rights left in that copyright in whatever work that you've created. If you license some of those rights, say, for example, the license to display, you are keeping as the copyright under the rest of those rights to yourself. So you're only giving them away or selling that one renting it per se because maybe you'd be able to take it back. these are really important things to know when you're looking at a contract at least to recognize those terms so you know what to think about or what to ask your lawyer about.

Liz Stapleton [00:06:49]:
Yeah. absolutely. So if you were to decide to register, so you don't have to register to have your copyright if you were to decide to register, how would you go about it and sort of how often because I feel like as well as we're constantly creating So I feel like that can be really tedious. What would you kind of recommend or say?

Jamie Lieberman [00:07:09]:
So the shocking thing is the government has not caught up to the digital age. And it is impossible to have an ongoing registration for your blog, because it's constantly changing. And so each posts. Like, you can't there are certain ways. Like, if you launch a blog and you have a whole bunch of posts, you can do that. Photographers will frequently batch their photos so they take them, but they don't actually publish them. And then you can actually batch those images in a copyright registration. So you're not doing each photo individually. So unpublished works, and this is a really great tip for course creators before publishing your course, you can do a batch copyright registration of that whole course. If you've published it and you wanna go back and copyright register it, it can be messy and complicated because every single video, every single download is its own work, and it can be really expensive and overwhelming. So that is a really good tip to remember is published versus unpublished. It's actually very easy to do copyright registration. And this is one of those areas where DIY, I think, is completely fine. not expensive. I think the filing fee is about $55. and then you're just essentially filling out a form. The copyright office does not look into the validity of your copyright in a different way that the trademark office looks into the validity of trade. They're totally run. and we will. But copy rights are fairly simple. You could do it yourself if you need or want to. Some of my clients are like, I'll do it myself and other of my are like, I want no part of that. So you just have to make a personal choice as to what makes sense for you and what you're most comfortable with doing. the nice thing so with a blog, Here's my recommendation for people. If you have, say, 20 posts, 20 images, any product that you're creating or selling, Those are the ones that I think the top 20, say your most viral photos, your most popular posts, the things that get pinned the most If you're gonna go the right of copyright registration, that's what I always recommend doing. It's the easiest way. And just keep an eye on it. Maybe once a year, look at your traffic, say, This is kind of a popular post. I'm just gonna do a quick registration for it. If you're selling any digital product, courses, downloads, ebooks, anything. I definitely recommend registering that for copyright. It just makes it so much easier to stop someone from copying.

Liz Stapleton [00:09:28]:
That's a great point. and so now that we've kind of you've got the copyrights You registered whatever, you know, you needed to or felt you should. What do you do if someone steals it?

Jamie Lieberman [00:09:42]:
Yeah. That stinks. I hate I hate hearing these. So The first thing that you have to look at is do I have a valid copyright registration? And if you do, if you have a valid copyright registration, you have certain rights. So your first right is you have a right to sue somebody for copyright infringement in federal court if you need to. You have the right to get potentially staff victory damages, which means I don't have to prove that I was damaged. Just by nature of the registration, I get certain damages. You also have the ability to get attorney's fees in certain instances if you are forced to sue. You also have assumption of validity. So it's presumed that your copyright is valid. and the other side is to show that it isn't. So that's a huge burden that if you don't have that registration, you have to jump through those hoops. So those alone are really amazing reasons. to have copyright registration because when you, unfortunately, somebody does copy you, when you send that letter, The first thing that other person's attorney, if they have one and they're smart, is going to look for is, does this person have a registration? And if they have a registration, nine times out of

Liz Stapleton [00:10:45]:
10,

Jamie Lieberman [00:10:46]:
they're gonna say, settle this case, and you could get you could get money for it. So having the registration does have some great benefits. If you don't have the registration, don't despair. you certainly can still send a cease and desist. You still have the right to ask people to pull down anything that you've created that's that's yours and that you own the copyright for. it's just you have more hoops to jump through and the lawyers don't act as quickly. Although they do act, particularly if you have a lawyer send a letter on your behalf.

Liz Stapleton [00:11:15]:
Yes. cease and desist is always the kind of 1st thing. And and you can do a formal one through a lawyer, but you can also, depending on the, like, like, if it's a couple of images, they didn't, like, fill your entire site. you might just reach out and be like, hey. Not cool. Take a chance. Or I'm gonna have my lawyer get involved.

Jamie Lieberman [00:11:31]:
I actually really encourage that, particularly because at a certain point, like, Are you gonna fight over a little bit of money? You have to make that. If it's a product that you've created and and they've copied your whole course.

Liz Stapleton [00:11:41]:
Yeah. Your entire site or something. That's different. Another thing I wouldn't reach out personally. I would just go to the lawyer route. Yeah.

Jamie Lieberman [00:11:48]:
Totally agree. The other thing also to think about is sometimes when you file a lot of people file DMCA take down notices. Sometimes the hosts, they don't respond till they hear from a lawyer. so I've had clients who have been trying to do it themselves. They come to me in within a day, the rate is taken down. So that is definitely another advantage to utilizing a lawyer as we tend to get a little bit more traction a little faster. Yeah.

Liz Stapleton [00:12:11]:
Take get taken a little more seriously.

Jamie Lieberman [00:12:14]:
Yeah. The

Liz Stapleton [00:12:14]:
other thing to kind of take note is depending on where it's at, right, because we talked about, you know, Instagram, you know, that may give you another, like, hey. It's in their terms of service. They they will kick you off you're found too of, like, stolen images. Right? So sometimes, you know, if you don't necessarily have your Instagram, things that you've created, copyrighted,

Jamie Lieberman [00:12:35]:
Yes.

Liz Stapleton [00:12:36]:
Instagram's terms of services give you a little leverage as well.

Jamie Lieberman [00:12:39]:
Yes. Exactly. Although cautionary tale, I did have a client who filed about a 1000 DMC take down notices with Pinterest. It was I wish I was exaggerating that, and she got threatened with a pretty severe lawsuit because she was ultimately starting to harass the other party. So do take it seriously. A DMC take down notice is not something to do in anger. it's not something to do unless you're very certain that you've been copied. And if you have, you should absolutely use that tool, but it can get you you definitely wanna make sure that you're doing it, using it judiciously.

Liz Stapleton [00:13:14]:
Yes. Yes. Not every little thing. because like you said, it's the first thing you have to do is that is is actually kind of violation of my copyright.

Jamie Lieberman [00:13:21]:
Yes. Exactly. Yeah. I mean, that goes back to the whole idea of ideas are not copyright protected. So I get a lot of emails from, bloggers who may have done, like, a DIY tutorial and Target or some other company picks it up and makes it themselves, and they're angry and upset. Understandably, they've created it. but the end result is not real doesn't have a high levels of copyright protection, so it's pretty challenging sort of go after, a large company for doing that. So it's important to understand what is copyright protectable.

Liz Stapleton [00:13:54]:
Yes. And you can always reach out to a lawyer for that as well.

Jamie Lieberman [00:13:57]:
Yeah. Sure. Agree.

Liz Stapleton [00:14:00]:
Alright. So let's because I feel like now we're starting to drift into trademarks a little bit just in the idea of, I remember seeing this posted in a blogging Facebook group because don't you get just the like, examples and questions there. Someone's like, oh my gosh. I can't believe it. I created this thing, and I got it, notice saying I can't name it this.

Jamie Lieberman [00:14:20]:
Ah.

Liz Stapleton [00:14:21]:
And it literally was the same kind of product that the trademark was for, and we're like, no. Really, you have to, like, change your name.

Jamie Lieberman [00:14:30]:
So -- Change it fast.

Liz Stapleton [00:14:31]:
Yes. So so let's, first of all, why don't you kind of explain what a trademark is? Because it feel like we really don't understand that term at all.

Jamie Lieberman [00:14:41]:
Totally agree. So a trademark, I like to tell people to look at trademarks from the perspective of the consumer. So don't think about it as the business owner, but think about you as a consumer. A trademark is a source indicator, meaning I am going to look at something, and I'm going to know exactly who or what created it, whether it's a good or a service. So Nike is my favorite example to use because we have that beautiful swoosh, which is absolutely trademark protected. And so when you see a Nike swoosh, you know what you're getting. You know, you're getting a pair of sneakers. You know what the quality is gonna be. you know, likely what the aesthetic is going to be, and you know you're getting a nike a pair of Nike's. If someone else was allowed to put that swoosh on a pair of sneakers that would say subpar or wasn't great and it fell apart in a week, the consumer would be really baffled and wonder what was going on. And so that trademark protection is done to protect consumers. So they know what they're getting. You know what you're buying. When you walk into McDonald's, you know, their fries are gonna be amazing. And so if you got a McDa if you walked into a restaurant called McDonald's in the weren't good, you'd be very confused. So that's really how you have to look at it. So it's a source. It's a name, a logo. It can be a color. It can be a smell. We I went through this with someone, and they were like, a smell and it absolutely can. Although I don't really recommend it for most because it's hard to prove. Yeah. But Names and logos for, bloggers and content creators are the most common. The name is what we call a word mark. So your name, hashtag legal is a good example of that. And then your logo is obviously your logo. Sometimes it's just your name in a certain font or script, colors, It could also be an image. many bloggers come to me a little bit confused. Do I wanna protect my name? Do I wanna protect my logo? I tend to, recommend starting with the name of the word mark because that's usually what the source indicator is. However, if you are a content creator who, if you are a content creator who does a lot of licensing, And your logo appears on certain things. That is where your logo may come into play where you may wanna consider protecting your logo as a trademark as well. So that's also important too. And, I definitely that's a case by case basis. And this will then go into my conversation with Trademark should not be DIY ever. You need an experienced trademark practitioner. It is a very specialized area of law. It is some of the most high malpractice rates in the world for our insurance for that reason. and so many mistakes get made. So legal zooms and people who've never done trademarks before or your friend who went to law school was like, yeah, I'll try it. not your best idea.

Liz Stapleton [00:17:23]:
I don't know. I'm like, nope. I was like, you need to go to a trademark lawyer for that. I feel not my not my not in my wheelhouse.

Jamie Lieberman [00:17:30]:
It's very it's I've been doing it for a very long time, and I still learn things every single day.

Liz Stapleton [00:17:36]:
And part of it is because there's the category. Right? So your trademark only applies in your category that you've been approved on. Yes. I've gotten questions about that too. I had someone reach out and bill it because they have podcasts name, and then they saw a that they just got trademarked. They were like, pumped, and they saw someone doing a summit under the same name, but it was completely different. You know, I was like, you I was like, I don't know for sure. I was like, but it's not a podcast. So Probably out of luck there. you know, so so can you explain sort of the characteristics how that sort of works and why, you know, because I think that adds to why you need someone experience.

Jamie Lieberman [00:18:15]:
Absolutely. So those categories are called by the trademark office, the trademark class. And there are so many different classes. and they are broken down into sub classes. It is overwhelming. and, you know, sort of the automated systems, have you fill out a bunch of questions, and then they shoot out, a potential class for you. And they're always they're so crafted carefully for each individual client So what the class does is it describes the category of goods or services you're offering. So, for example, if you create an app, You're probably in class 9, which is, downloadable computer software. and then we do, like, a whole bunch of other descriptions. And so you could have multiple software, multiple companies with the same name that creates software so long as that is not potentially confusing. So the thing that everybody is always thinking about when they're thinking, can I use this name? Is this name trademark protected? is whether or not there's a likelihood of confusion between the marks. And so you have to look at that in a couple of different ways. So you look at it based on the name, the actual word or logo, depending on what you're comparing, and then the class that the the trademark is registered in. And so it is the same or similar. And this is where people get really confused the similar. It's very easy when you have 2 identical in the same exact class, offering very similar things. You're like, good. That's easy. It's where the similarity is different, and that really is kind of it's like a it's like an art. It's not a science. Every trademark examiner who has to review does it differently. Some trademark examiners passed by with, marks I am sure are gonna get rejected and others who I know should not are getting rejected. So it is really, really hard, to game the system or guess it, and you just sort of have to do your best with the tips and tricks that you know from many years of experience. And so you're creating that class to describe only what it is that you're currently doing, not what you hope to do. So if you create clothing and you only create t shirts, if you try to register with t shirts and sweatshirts and pants and socks, you're going to have to show proof of your use of that in every single category. So it's really important that you're only registering how you're using it or planning to use it.

Liz Stapleton [00:20:33]:
Okay. and then so tech is there, like, copyright sort of an a common law trademark.

Jamie Lieberman [00:20:43]:
There is. Yes. Exactly. So you just using a name does give you common law trademark protection. What that does is it gives you that geographic protection. It it gives you that protection in the geographic area you're using

Liz Stapleton [00:20:56]:
it. Mhmm.

Jamie Lieberman [00:20:57]:
Once again, Online. Yep. Yeah. So that's a tough one. usually, what ends up happening is you sort of get limited to the area where you live. And so if you're if you're doing business at home and, you know, you live in say New York City, you may be limited and you may not be able to use that mark nationwide. which is why in the age of the of the online space and utilization of marks nationwide, it is important to think about getting trademark registration. The per the first person who uses a mark, whether registered or not has what's called priority.

Liz Stapleton [00:21:29]:
Yep.

Jamie Lieberman [00:21:30]:
So you have priority of use. If someone comes in after you and tries to register a mark, that's the same or similar likelihood of confusion, you can actually stop them. even if you don't have a trademark registration, and you can prevent them from moving forward. if they succeed. You can cancel their mark. There's a lot of things that you have the potential to be able to do, but it's way easier to do. Like, it's messy. it's expensive and it's way easier to do when you have a trademark registration as well.

Liz Stapleton [00:22:00]:
Okay. yeah. And and so the difference so you could even correct me if I'm wrong. because again, not my wheelhouse. You can even do like a the TM mark, even if you're not registered, you can't do the r. That is what -- Correct. -- makes it different.

Jamie Lieberman [00:22:14]:
That is absolutely correct. So you can use a TM all day long if you want if it's a trademark. but when you go to apply to the trademark office, you have to show them. So there's 2 different applications. I should back up a little bit. There's a use in commerce application, which means you're actually using the mark in connection with with and services that you are currently selling. So you had to have made a sale. and it has to be in interstate commerce, meaning across state lines. This is for federal trademark, applications. There are state level ones. I I don't know many people who use them every once in a while if you sort of have, like, a mom and pop shop that's on the corner of a main street that doesn't cross straight lines. Yeah. You're, like,

Liz Stapleton [00:22:55]:
focused, like, your blog is about the town you're in. Correct.

Jamie Lieberman [00:22:58]:
then maybe. But even then, you usually have made an affiliate sale. So it even then, you'd probably be able to get, and it doesn't have to be a lot of money. So if people are like, oh, but I've only made, like,

Liz Stapleton [00:23:07]:
$10 dollars from Amazon?

Jamie Lieberman [00:23:09]:
Totally fine. That's enough. One sale is all you need. so that's important as well. and so once you have that, you can file a use in commerce and you need in connection with that, what are called specimens, which is just proof to the trademark office that you are using the mark in connection with those goods and services. The use has to be ongoing. You don't get to stop using it. So you have to tell the trademark office every 5 years that you're continuing to use it or you will lose it. if you're not using it, but you have a really good idea, you can file what's called an intent to use application, meaning I'm not using it yet. but I intend to use, so, say, within the next 6 6 to 18 months is usually the time frame that I give to clients. if your plans are 5 years away, You're gonna keep filing extensions and you only get so many extensions before you you don't get to save a name forever. and that's just basically because of competition. So it's important that you are using it. Continue to use it. so, yes. So the specimen just has to show has to have a connect to that, to those goods and services.

Liz Stapleton [00:24:12]:
Right. And you did mention you're like, make sure it is a trademark because not everything is

Jamie Lieberman [00:24:18]:
Yes.

Liz Stapleton [00:24:19]:
So can you shed a little more light on that?

Jamie Lieberman [00:24:21]:
Yeah. I love this. So everybody thinks about trademarks in connection with the likelihood of confusion. What what people don't think about is trademarks, the trademark office, and trademark law really likes what I call fanciful names or, arbitrary names. So fanciful being Nike. or arbitrary being Apple because an Apple exists, but nobody thinks an Apple is a computer. and so those companies really have had to work to create the source recognition. So you see that apple. You know exactly what you're getting. That's a true trademark. So they have what's called the spectrum of distinctiveness, which I just love that. I think it's

Liz Stapleton [00:25:04]:
so funny.

Jamie Lieberman [00:25:05]:
it's so good. And so the arbitrary, the fanciful, those are more protected than generic marks. So generic marks would be if I tried to call a line of computers computer. you can't do that because you you essentially can't stop other people from utilizing names that are commonly known to mean a certain thing.

Liz Stapleton [00:25:25]:
-- very much works on soda. You call it soda. Correct.

Jamie Lieberman [00:25:28]:
Xerox is a great example. Kleenex too. That's called genericizing your name. And so you essentially have created, over Google is a great example of that. They don't want you to say you're googling something unless you're using Google. and Xerox. It's not Xerox. It's copying. and so the words just maintain their strong trademark status. They can't mean what they are. So the issue doesn't really become a generic. It becomes with descriptive. So merely descriptive is one of the common reasons why trademark get rejected by the trademark office. and that just means it describes what it is. a common example is if you've ever driven to an airport and you park your car to park and fly. those are considered, or now they have protection because they've been around a long time and have acquired distinctiveness, but that is descriptive. It is parking and flying. and so if your blog describes what it is that you do, for example, you if you teach SEO and you say SEO teaching SEO is the name of your blog, That's great for SEO, and there's nothing wrong with that, but you may have a harder time getting trademark protection. It's a trade off. And that's because, obviously, the trademark office wants to work and make sure the companies are working to create sources that people will immediately think of. And so it's a it's a business decision to make whether or not you want to make something that's a little bit more fanciful or suggestive Suggestive is really the sweet spot where I see most blogs. so it's not necessarily describing what they do, but it suggests it. So sprint, like, your You know, that suggests a characteristic, like fast data, fast phone, but nobody would ever think that sprint relates to phone services or data services.

Liz Stapleton [00:27:18]:
Yeah. There you go. Yeah. Yes.

Jamie Lieberman [00:27:20]:
So you have to think about it that way too.

Liz Stapleton [00:27:22]:
Yeah. And I know we kinda touched on it, but I don't know that it really drove home is just because someone has the same name as you doesn't mean you can't use it if it's a completely different thing.

Jamie Lieberman [00:27:33]:
Correct.

Liz Stapleton [00:27:33]:
Like, I was just throwing example out there. We as lawyers are very familiar with Lexis. It's a legal research platform. Right? It all samples background checks and laughing. There's also a car company called Lexus. Mhmm. And so the names are the same, but they're completely different industries, and so it's fine. Yep. You know, so just kind of keeping that in mind. I mean, you do walk a fine line if you don't know what you're doing, but --

Jamie Lieberman [00:27:55]:
Yes. Yeah. Exactly. Dove chocolate and dove soap are another example of that.

Liz Stapleton [00:28:00]:
Oh, yeah. That's a great issue.

Jamie Lieberman [00:28:02]:
Yeah. So they they definite. And the interesting thing about Lexus that you've described is they spell it differently.

Liz Stapleton [00:28:09]:
Yes.

Jamie Lieberman [00:28:09]:
Spelling changes though don't matter. So and switching of names. So if you have a mark that's his and hers something and you make it her and his, that's not going to distinguish them properly if there is a likelihood of confusion, misspellings, changing of spellings, you know, changing of one word.

Liz Stapleton [00:28:27]:
What about adding one word? Like the.

Jamie Lieberman [00:28:30]:
No. That that typically will not make a difference. there the trademark office will look. This is where the nuance has come into play. What the dominant words are.

Liz Stapleton [00:28:38]:
Yeah.

Jamie Lieberman [00:28:39]:
Like a the is not a dominant word. and so those dominant words are the ones that need to be distinguished. It doesn't mean words can't overlap, but there has to be enough differences in getting a legal opinion about that is makes all the difference.

Liz Stapleton [00:28:52]:
Oh, absolutely. And like we said, trademark is something you definitely wanna --

Jamie Lieberman [00:28:55]:
Yeah.

Liz Stapleton [00:28:55]:
-- charge an attorney for.

Jamie Lieberman [00:28:57]:
Yes. Absolutely.

Liz Stapleton [00:28:58]:
And that's even me as an I'm an attorney, but I'd still go because this isn't my this isn't my wheelhouse. You know? so I think you know, trade when would you recommend someone getting a trademark? You know, I mean, should they do it first year they're blogging? Should they do, you know, obviously, there's a cost to that.

Jamie Lieberman [00:29:18]:
Sure.

Liz Stapleton [00:29:19]:
but what sort of what do you what's your thoughts?

Jamie Lieberman [00:29:22]:
So if you've been blogging for a really long time and you haven't done trademark registration, you're not allowed to panic. a lot of people do that. I think if you are making money from your business and your brand, if you are building a brand, if you are selling products, and if you want to prevent other people from utilizing a same or similar name, then it is definitely something worth exploring. If you are new and entering the market, just at minimum, have somebody check the name. I had a client who did a whole rebrand. She didn't check the name. And that was a very expensive mistake because she was definitely infringing on somebody else's mark. Who, by the way, when she first checked it, hadn't registered it, but registered it before

Liz Stapleton [00:30:05]:
she. Yeah.

Jamie Lieberman [00:30:06]:
Yeah. So it is important. I don't say that to make people afraid. I say that to help people know that it really happens. and we're not just making it up.

Liz Stapleton [00:30:15]:
Yes. Yes.

Jamie Lieberman [00:30:16]:
It really happens.

Liz Stapleton [00:30:18]:
the domain's available. Doesn't mean?

Jamie Lieberman [00:30:21]:
Oh, thank you. The domain means nothing. The social channels mean nothing. Totally different law. In fact, if you have a registered trademark and somebody else owns the domain, it does not automatically mean you're gonna get you may likely will not. The only thing that you can do is prevent them from putting up content or creating anything or selling anything under that domain that would that would somehow infringe upon your registered mark.

Liz Stapleton [00:30:44]:
Yeah. I mean, it might make them more likely to sell it to you. but --

Jamie Lieberman [00:30:48]:
Maybe you'd be surprised. Yeah. That's the other thing when they drive up the cost.

Liz Stapleton [00:30:52]:
Yeah. They're like, they really want it. They went through for this.

Jamie Lieberman [00:30:55]:
That's exactly right. That's exactly right.

Liz Stapleton [00:30:58]:
but yeah. And then so, obviously, it's gonna vary, but is there, like, a range in cost of how much to, you know, have an attorney do trademark?

Jamie Lieberman [00:31:08]:
It really depends. I think just making sure that you're talking with a good trademark attorney makes all the sense, and just getting an idea from them. I think if you're budgeting somewhere, you know, it's gonna be, I believe it should be a minimum a $1000 for lawyer's time. It's likely much more than that.

Liz Stapleton [00:31:26]:
-- lower? Like, you probably wanna go to a different lawyer.

Jamie Lieberman [00:31:29]:
Yeah. So, I mean, I think probably a few $1000 is something good to budget for that. they're, you know, the fees to the trademark office are

Jamie Lieberman [00:31:36]:
$225

Jamie Lieberman [00:31:38]:
per class that we talked about. So if you have multiple classes of goods and services, you will have multiple filing fees to the trademark office. but, yeah, it's it's not cheap, but it's also, it's worth it.

Liz Stapleton [00:31:50]:
It is. And then that makes it easier to kinda monitor someone -- Yeah. -- files, you know, that's the infringe that you get.

Jamie Lieberman [00:31:57]:
That's another important thing I wanna point out with anything with intellectual property or intellectual property on which, by the way, intellectual property, we're talking about trademarks and copyright. I realize I used that a lot. And we just assume it as a percent of people now.

Liz Stapleton [00:32:10]:
So you're --

Jamie Lieberman [00:32:10]:
Yeah. Good. Intellectual property just means trademarks and copyright. but your intellectual property is only as good as you are willing to prosecute it. So if you are gonna be a creator, And I know nobody everybody's like, the groan. You gotta protect it. You gotta be strong about it. You gotta send those letters You gotta make sure that you stop people from infringing on it. If you don't care, that's okay, but you don't get to have it both ways.

Liz Stapleton [00:32:36]:
So because that's a good point. So you can't if you're gonna file it, you've gotta take steps and continue to protect it. Or you're gonna --

Jamie Lieberman [00:32:43]:
Correct. Yes. Exactly. Or you're or you'll lose it.

Liz Stapleton [00:32:46]:
Yeah. It's a use it or lose it type of thing. like, you know, that lifetime deal you got elsewhere. But, yeah, any final words you care to add or advice or well, not, right, because this is not legal advice. Correct.

Jamie Lieberman [00:33:01]:
We'll get

Liz Stapleton [00:33:01]:
that disclosure at the beginning.

Jamie Lieberman [00:33:03]:
information only. I think

Liz Stapleton [00:33:05]:
-- -- information you would like to have. I don't

Jamie Lieberman [00:33:08]:
know. Exactly. So in my opinion, it's just really smart to talk to a lawyer about your intellectual property, particularly if you're creating products and services, not just your blog, but if you are monetizing your blog and making some money, it is important talk about it. At least understand it so that you can make the decision that's right for you. It's different for everybody. So don't worry what your friends are doing. Don't worry what everyone around you tells you, get to know a lawyer who understands this area, who understands what it's like to be a blogger, how to make money, how you're monetizing, and then really get a good plan in place. Having a good legal strategy, it will make you sleep at night.

Liz Stapleton [00:33:43]:
And that, I think, is an excellent point as well. I mean, they should definitely reach out to hashtag legal is not all lawyers are familiar with this sort of online world of business. there's a lot of And I know because of my previous 9 to 5, like, I was having to, like, I was like, please just learn how to use the computer research. You know? Like, because that was, like, my job was to teach them the platform, but and I was, so there are a lot of kind of crusty lawyers that don't keep up with the technology. Just wanna think of, like, your grandpa. Would your grandpa understand it? You know, if your grandpa's a lawyer, he's not the one you wanna go to if he doesn't understand it. you know, --

Jamie Lieberman [00:34:24]:
Or even your friend who writes Wills.

Liz Stapleton [00:34:26]:
Yes.

Jamie Lieberman [00:34:27]:
Like, your friend could have an awesome Instagram account, and her firm is all about Wills I would never write a will. I don't do real estate closings. There's that reason.

Liz Stapleton [00:34:36]:
So -- I mean, I obviously have a lot of friends that are lawyers. I went to law school, and they don't know doing a lot. No.

Jamie Lieberman [00:34:43]:
Oh, my my husband's an attorney, and I he's a very traditional attorney unlike, myself. And he I go to his stuff and his partners at his law firm are like, what do you do? They don't get it. And I'm like, that's fine. Don't get it.

Liz Stapleton [00:34:54]:
I actually will go to, you know, I'm I'm there's other ones out there, I feel like yours is really well known within this space. It's got great reputation.

Jamie Lieberman [00:35:02]:
Thank you.

Liz Stapleton [00:35:03]:
And you do have a freebie for attendees. It's a negotiation because one of the things you help with too is negotiations and negotiate worksheet. Yes. Anything you wanna share about that?

Jamie Lieberman [00:35:14]:
So negotiation is near and dear to my heart. We do a lot of contract works as well. So hashtag legal does all across the gamut where we do, you know, business information and contracts and privacy, all that good stuff FTC, but contracts and negotiations are sort of near and dear to my heart. I was a law school professor for many years, I taught negotiation. And I really think that as creatives, we sometimes struggle to negotiate

Liz Stapleton [00:35:39]:
Yeah.

Jamie Lieberman [00:35:39]:
Yeah. So I give a lot of talks, about negotiation, and I've created this worksheet that sort of gives you a little bit of a framework on how to negotiate and make it feel more accessible. and I'm actually gonna be putting out a lot more information about negotiation this year. so if you do download the worksheet, you don't have you, but if you do sign up for our mailing list, you're gonna get. We're creating a lot of really cool information products. Not templates. It's not really my jam. I prefer to sort of give people information and things that they can absorb themselves. but, yeah, negotiation is definitely something key that all creatives should think about more

Liz Stapleton [00:36:16]:
Absolutely. because you never know what you ask for. Like, if you could get what you ask for, it's, negotiation, really, it isn't about one party winning or losing. It's about both party things happy.

Jamie Lieberman [00:36:27]:
Yes. Collaborative. I love it.

Liz Stapleton [00:36:30]:
So, definitely, you know, just because a big brand sends you over sponsorship contract doesn't mean you have to sign You know, you --

Jamie Lieberman [00:36:36]:
Thank you. Redline that. Oh my gosh. Never I've never been in this is the 1st industry I was in where contracts did not get redlined regularly. I know. Yeah. You should be. You should for sure be negotiating for yourself. You'd be shocked at what you can get. So I created this. it's totally a free download, but I think it's pretty helpful in at least giving a good framework to make it feel less scary.

Liz Stapleton [00:37:00]:
Yes. Absolutely. Awesome. Well, thank you. That was great. And hopefully everyone goes to download that and has found this helpful. I think it really shines light and and kind of because it it's it's one of the things that people are scared because they don't know, and hopefully they'll be a little more, and they'll be a little more comfortable. So thank you.

Jamie Lieberman [00:37:18]:
Thank you.

**Transcript:**
[00:00:13.310] - Liz, Host
Hey, guys, I'm super excited about our next guest. She is a returning speaker. She's part of the very first Blogger Breakthrough summit. But before I tell you a little bit about her, I need to give you guys just a quick disclaimer because we are both attorneys. But while we are attorneys, we're are not your attorneys. And this is not legal advice. We don't know your specifics, it's for informational, educational purposes only. If you aren't sure what you should do, you should consult with an attorney. Okay. Alright.

[00:00:38.580] - Liz, Host
So, our next guest is the founder and owner of Hashtag Legal. She's been practicing for 16 years, working with entrepreneurs and has a deep desire to really make legal accessible. So, she's a regular speaker at conferences. And like I said, she's been here before. I'm super excited to welcome Jamie Lieberman from Hashtag Legal. Jamie, welcome.

[00:00:59.640] - Jamie
Thanks for having me.

[00:01:01.210] - Liz, Host
Yeah, I'm super excited to have you back. So, last time you were here, we were talking about kind of intellectual property, like trademarks copyrights. And we'll touch on that. But I kind of want to talk about the mistakes people make with intellectual property this time just to give it a little bit of difference. So, where would you say people get in trouble when it comes to intellectual property or IP, which we might shorten it to?

[00:01:29.270] - Jamie
Oh, my gosh, how much time do we have? No, I'm just kidding. There's a couple of areas. And so, I think we should break it down by trademark and copyright because they're two very different areas. So, before I launch into that, I'm going to do a quick just definition of each. You know trademark being your name, your brand name as you know, let's call it your source Identifier. So what you do business as and it can be your words. It can be your logo. If you use me. As an example, Hashtag Legal is my word Mark.

[00:02:01.260] - Jamie
And then I have an actual logo, both of which are registered trademarks. Even if you haven't registered your name, you still do get some protection. So that's your trademark and then copyright is just the rights that you have in the works that you create. So, your website, your photos, your blog posts, videos, all of the above. And so, there are sort of two different areas where I see issues. The first area is nobody bothering to look at their intellectual property and say, one, can I use it?

[00:02:35.780] - Jamie
And two, how can I protect it? And then the third way that I see people sort of making mistakes is just using other people's intellectual property incorrectly. So, those are sort of the broad areas where I see people have issues in their business.

[00:02:53.610] - Liz, Host
Alright. So, let's dig deeper first into how people are incorrectly using other people's intellectual property, because I feel like that's going to get you in trouble faster. 

[00:03:04.690] - Jamie
Yes. Yes. So, in connection with copyright, that one's pretty simple, right. And many people listening may have had this experience where someone lifts your photo and they use it for themselves. Sometimes people give attribution and say, oh, but I tagged you. This is called infringement. So, when you use somebody else's intellectual property without a license or permission, that's the term license. You are essentially potentially infringing on someone's intellectual property. So, if somebody decides to use your photo, they don't ask you for permission. Maybe they tag you. That's still infringement.

[00:03:41.050] - Jamie
Just because you give attribution does not solve your infringement problem. So that's a big area use of photos, videos, music, blog posts, anything, use of anything anyone else has created that you have not asked for permission for. That's a huge problem, and that can actually be really expensive in the copyright world.

[00:04:04.290] - Liz, Host
Yeah. And I feel like we see this a lot like yes, roundup posts and blog posts, but also just in social media Instagram. I feel like it's constantly coming up. People haven't learned their lesson.

[00:04:13.500] - Jamie
They can't just repost someone's post and you write repost doesn't fix it.

[00:04:18.960] - Liz, Host
No Pinterest and all that. Okay. So how would someone go about getting permission or finding out what the license options are?

[00:04:28.690] - Jamie
Yeah. So, the first piece of advice I have is if you have a fellow blogger and you want to do a roundup or you love their image or you want to shout them out, ask for permission. And it can be something as simple as a DM. It does not have to be this epic license that you sign, and it's 15 pages long. It could literally be sending a message to somebody saying, hey, I love that photo. Do you mind if I posted on my Instagram, I'll give you attribution? And if they write back and say yes, you're good to go.

[00:04:57.810] - Jamie
That's all you really need. Now, this is a little bit different for professional photographers. Professional photographers have extremely strict and frankly, very lengthy licenses and almost always are going to request money in connection with the use of their images. And so, it just depends on who you're talking to and it can be a wide range. My first piece of advice is to ask. If they don't answer, don't use it. If someone says yes and gives you parameters for use, follow those parameters. And that's a very simple way.

[00:05:29.210] - Jamie
Email, DM, just save it. If you have a DM, just screenshot it and save it in your file. So you have it in case somebody comes back around and says, hey, I didn't give you that permission. You want to hold on to it. So that's really important, too. So that's one way. Another way is to actually go to a website and purchase a license. Licenses are overwhelming. They're long if you go to. I mean, I get lots of emails from clients saying, I don't even know if I can use what I've bought in the way that I want to. So, you know there's a lot of times one sort of really good trick is if you go into some of the stock photo licensing, and I'm not sure about the free ones.

[00:06:08.200] - Jamie
I very much say, stay away from the free ones. But if you're talking about a subscription or some kind of model, they have FAQs often that will explain what their licenses mean really really well. So, some of the really good ones that are well known, just to go to the FAQ and see if the use that you want is appropriate for how you're using it. This is the same with, like, podcast music. That's a big one where you're almost always going to use what's called royalty free music.

[00:06:35.090] - Jamie
You pay a flat fee, you're able to use it in your podcast. YouTube videos are the same. So, all of those things I think are important to just know what license you're buying.

[00:06:53.270] - Liz, Host
You know it's turning on. I'm sorry. Yes, so, because I feel like a lot of people get really concerned or completely oblivious and then side, you know side way trying to figure it out. Okay. So, going back to the other way you said people get into trouble. We kind of talked about, can they use it? But the next part you said was, how do they protect it? So, let's touch on that and mistakes people make in thinking maybe they're predicted when they're not.

[00:07:20.210] - Jamie
So, copyright and trademark are very different. And we didn't also can touch on how you're potentially using someone else's trademark incorrectly. But maybe we'll circle back to that at some point. But let's talk about how we can protect. So, copyright and trademark both, you have the option to register with the US Patent and Trademark Office or the US Copyright Office. So, trademarks go to the USPTO Copyright registrations go to the US Copyright Office. And so, if you have something that you've created and so typically for bloggers, I see that with ebooks.

[00:07:56.160] - Jamie
I see that with downloads, courses are a huge one. Any digital product that you're creating, if you want to make sure that you can stop infringers in the most easy way possible. That's why you need copyright registration. So, when you create something, you automatically have copyright rights in them. And that includes the right to give away your Copyright, to keep it for yourself, to ask other people to stop using your images or whatever copyright protected work that you have. However, if you don't have a registration, there are certain benefits that you're not getting.

[00:08:33.010] - Jamie
So, if you have a copyright registration, you're able to sue in federal court for copyright infringement. When you sue, you will get, you can get, I should say, attorney's fees, meaning your fees that you had to pay your lawyer. The other side will have to pay them if you prevail. And then also you can get something called statutory damages, which means I don't have to prove how I'm damaged. And that's really powerful. So, when you get those cease and desist you know when cease and desist gets sent around and there's a copyright registration attached.

[00:09:07.930] - Jamie
People start to pay attention because it's really hard to defend against copyright infringement if somebody has a valid registration. So, copyright registration is really critical now. Shockingly, the US government is not caught up to the 21st century and so, it is challenging for really prolific content creators like bloggers. There is a new sort of application that you can use to register your actual blog, like on a quarterly basis. But it's a really really really narrow usage. And so, I'd say talk to a lawyer because copyright registration can be really a bit complicated, and it's something that's kind of difficult to do on your own.

[00:09:48.640] - Jamie
So, there are ways to protect your actual blog. But you need to make sure that you're using it correctly and you don't want to waste a lot of time and money and then get rejected by the Copyright office. So, it's definitely worthwhile at least talking to someone to see what a good registration strategy is. And sometimes it just doesn't even make sense to register. Sometimes you pick and choose certain things that you've created that make a lot more sense. Trademarks are a whole other story. 

[00:10:17.090] - Jamie
Trademark, you, like I said, the same with copyright. If you're using a name or a logo and you haven't registered it, you do have rights in the name or logo. But those rights are narrow, and so, you don't get the great protections that you do if you get your trademark registered. And so, you're limited by sort of your exact use, meaning the goods and services that are connected to the trademark as you are currently using them. You're limited to the geographic area in which you are using them, which in the world of the internet is sometimes a little amorphous, and people have a hard time sort of understanding that.

[00:10:50.440] - Jamie
But it will be limited by geographic restraints, even if you are a nationwide blogger. And finally, you know the same with doing in federal court. It's much easier if you have a trademark registration. So, you also get a much wider protection. You get nationwide protection, and you also get to stop people who are using a same or similar trademark in connection with the same or similar goods and services. That's a lot wider than just your typical sort of you know  use based rights that you get if you don't register your trademark.

[00:11:26.850] - Jamie
Sure.

[00:11:28.730] - Liz, Host
So, registering is number one protected, obviously. But registering isn't the end all deal. Because if you aren't being proactive, correct me if I'm wrong and going after people that are trying to use it, then those protections can go away. You want to explain that better than I did?

[00:11:49.470] - Jamie
Yeah. No, no no. You're absolutely right. So, one important thing that I like to remind people of is your intellectual property is only as strong as you're willing to fight for it. And that is very exhausting for people who may not want to engage in conflict. But if you do want to protect your IP, if you do want to make sure that other people are not able to use it, if you do register your copyrights, if you do register your trademarks, if someone is infringing, if you see and I highly recommend you set up Google searches. 

[00:12:18.480] - Jamie
Lawyers often, you know we have a service where we monitor trademark applications on behalf of our clients and say, hey, this is potentially infringing. You're going to need to reach out and say, hey, I have a registered Mark and you're infringing on my Mark. And that requires a little bit of back and forth. So, you do have to be prepared if you want to protect your Mark, to basically prosecute the Mark, which means make sure that you're stopping people from infringing on what you've created.

[00:12:49.250] - Liz, Host
Yes. Okay. So, let's go ahead and touch on how people may be using go back and using trademarking correctly or using someone's trademarking correctly.

[00:12:59.880] - Jamie
Yeah. So, a big one is when we decide we love the name of our company. Right. We wake up one morning and we have this lightbulb effect and we're like, oh, my gosh, I'm going to use my company name because it's easy, Hashtag Legal. I fell in love with that name. I was like, I must have that name. And so, the big mistake I see is people don't clear the name, meaning check to make sure that someone else didn't have that bright idea and that there's not somebody else out there who's using a Mark that's the same or similar to yours in connection with the same or similar goods and services.

[00:13:30.550] - Jamie
And so to piggyback on that, that may sound very simple, but that analysis is incredibly complex. And I highly recommend that you talk to a trademark attorney before choosing a name, particularly if you're paying a marketing or branding person. They are absolutely not checking and clearing your name. If they have a good contract, they're going to tell you they're not checking or clearing the name. They're also not checking or clearing your logo. And if they're using stock sites, some of them, like, Canva, for example, you are not able to register a logo made in Canva for trademark protection because you might be using some of their stock images, and that isn't allowed.

[00:14:07.410] - Jamie
So, it is really important that you're checking on these things and making sure that everybody's talking to everybody else. So, if you have a wonderful idea, if you fall in love with the name, I highly highly recommend that you make sure that you can use that name before you invest any resources into marketing or creating a website or a logo or any one of those things. And to piggyback on that merely because a URL or social media channel is available does not necessarily mean that the trademark is clear.

[00:14:40.060] - Jamie
I hear it all the time. They're like, oh, but I bought the URL or but I have the social channel. That's meaningless. It does not matter.

[00:14:47.570] - Liz, Host
Yes. And just because you have those doesn't mean you'll get approved for three months later or something. So, I do want to go back because I feel like you know when we say in connection to a similar goods or service, I think some people might get freaked out like, oh, someone has that name, but it could be completely different. So, can you maybe just give an example or two or just explain that a little more clearly so that people understand the difference?

[00:15:11.260] - Jamie
Yeah. So let's use blogs, for example, because that's a fairly simple one. So, blogs are typically registered. When we say similar goods and services. We're talking about the class of the trademark and the trademark office looks at classes based on numbers. So, class 41 is the number that is typically used for blogs. And so, in class 41 is websites. It can be educational services, it can be entertainment services, so it starts to get broader and broader and broader. And so, if I have a blog called Hashtag Legal, let's just say that I created a blog called Hashtag Legal, and we write all about legal stuff.

[00:15:48.230] - Jamie
And then somebody else wants to create a podcast called Hashtag Legal. And I've registered my Mark for my blog. I could likely stop that person because the odds are the podcast is similar enough to the blog that it could be confusing that people would think I created the podcast even if I hadn't. So, it extends out. Or if someone created a course, a digital course. That's another similar service to my blog even if I've never created a course. And I get those rights and protections with my registered trademark.

[00:16:19.470] - Jamie
So that's really important, because I am basically extending out not necessarily my rights. But what I'm doing is I'm able to stop other people from creating goods and services that people may think I'm creating because I've established all the goodwill in the name Hashtag Legal. And if you hear Hashtag Legal, you think of our company. Someone were to go out and create a digital course called about law called Hashtag Legal. That'd be an issue for me because people might think they're buying from me. So, I would be able to likely stop somebody from using that name.

[00:16:49.730] - Liz, Host
Yes. But if someone is selling cars and it's like Hashtag Legal Cars, right? That's different. They can do that because someone is not going to get confused thinking of you.

[00:17:00.960] - Jamie
Exactly. That's the real test.

[00:17:03.220] - Liz, Host
Yes. Okay. So, what sort of actions can people take if they've maybe already made some of these mistakes to kind of fix them?

[00:17:14.570] - Jamie
So, my first piece of advice is, do not panic. We're not allowed to freak out. If you've not done some of the things that I'm talking about. The future is now we can start. So, I'd say when it comes to your website, I think you should do. And this happens to clients all the time. Do an audit of your site. Look at the photos that you posted. Like eight years ago because back then, people weren't talking about this stuff and nobody knew that. You couldn't just like Google image, search something and pull it off the Internet.

[00:17:44.710] - Jamie
I have clients that get cease and desist for use of a photo that they literally posted eight years ago and forgot. So, go back and do an audit of your site. Look at where you are using photos, replace those photos, do it slowly other time. You don't have to do it all day. I mean, every single day. It doesn't have to happen tomorrow, but make it a point to really audit your site and get rid of those stock photos you are using that. You don't know if you have a license for.

[00:18:08.540] - Jamie
That's number one. Number two, take a look at your name, check it out. Google it go into the Trademark Offices database. You can find that if you search TESS. That's the USPTO database for all trademarks, do a quick search to see what comes up. I will warn you, it is not the most user friendly of databases. It is really hard, but at minimum you will see if there's an exact match, or you will see if there's something glaring. Do some Google searches, look around and see if people are using the name that's the same as yours.

[00:18:42.470] - Jamie
The similar names is the really hard part. So, I do recommend that if you've been using your Mark for a really long time and you've never had an issue, the odds of you having an issue aren't huge, but could come up. If you're relatively new and you've just started using a name, that's a different story. But no matter how far along you are, I definitely recommend clearing it. And then having a conversation with an attorney and seeing whether or not trademark registration makes sense for you. For some people, it doesn't.

[00:19:09.840] - Jamie
So, I do want to be clear, like not every person needs to do all this stuff. And this is why having a good relationship with the lawyer and just sitting down and doing a little bit of strategy will help you decide clients absolutely walk in the door of my offices and I say, yeah, I don't think you should do that. Like don't put your resources into that. Let's focus on something else. So, strategy is really key.

[00:19:29.570] - Liz, Host
Okay. Yeah, and I do because I have played around with the I'm not a patent trademark IP specialist in any way. But I've gone in there and I've looked and it'll tell you the exact match, but it's not going to tell you if there's something similar. So that's where an attorney is very important. Okay, so, let me rethink how I'm going to phrase this question. If they are just starting out because I know a lot of the attendees at the summit are just starting out. They may not be watching this more advanced session, but what actions do they need to take to get them fix?

[00:20:09.530] - Liz, Host
Because you said you know copyright and trademark may not always be the right fit. What are other things they should be doing to sort of avoid problems?

[00:20:20.370] - Jamie
Having an understanding, a very basic understanding of each area of law. So, understanding copyright, understand how you can use other people's work. Understand what it means when if you have somebody contribute to your blog. Because that's another issue that I see come up a lot with copyright is people start to hire contributors or they go on those VA Facebook groups. And the VA is like, I have a recipe. You can use ten of them. And here's your photos. And then all of a sudden you realize this VA has not made sure that they are not original photos.

[00:20:52.910] - Jamie
So, know your sources, from who you are buying from and what you are posting, because even if the VA sold you a bad photo, if it's on your website, you are liable. So, it's really important. I think one really great thing is to just know where the sources of information is coming from, make sure that you have the licenses that you need, ask the right questions. And really get it in writing and save those licenses. And like I said, it does not have to be anything really super complicated.

[00:21:23.590] - Jamie
Just ask for permission and get it with the VA. Those are a little bit different. They are a bit risky because I have seen, unfortunately, some VA relationships go wrong with VAs that are using images that are not theirs, things like that. So, having an understanding of the sources of what you're putting up on your website and also a basic understanding of copyright law and a basic understanding of trademark law. And there are resources out there for sure to sort of give you those baseline information.

[00:21:54.210] - Jamie
That's good. But make sure you're getting that information from a lawyer because I see a lot of non lawyers talking about this. And copyright and trademark are probably two of the most complicated areas of law that you can practice. So, forming a relationship with an attorney early on is a great idea. I know a lot of people.

[00:22:12.500] - Liz, Host
I see attorney specifically.

[00:22:14.150] - Jamie
Yes. Thank you. And I know a lot of people think, oh, my gosh, that's so expensive. I can never do that. I can't afford it. I'll tell you that I offer, you know in our practice, we have, like, 30 minutes strategy sessions that we offer to clients just to come in to have a conversation. And maybe I don't hear from someone for another year after that because that's all they needed from us. And it is a really great investment to make, because a year or two, when things start to grow and get bigger, the client and I know each other already and they can come back and do what needs to get done.

[00:22:41.330] - Jamie
So, look for things like that. It's not as overwhelmingly expensive as you think.

[00:22:47.010] - Liz, Host
Yes. Alright. A couple of follow ups on that. Guest post. I'm just going to say guest post, and you tell me what comes to mind.

[00:22:58.980] - Jamie
Yeah. I mean, it's the same idea with contributors, like whether you're paying them, whether it's free, whether it's a trade. I know everybody loves the guest post because it helps you. Right. Like it's less work for you. But understand that the guest poster is not the one who's going to get the cease and desist, you are as the owner of the website. So, it isn't just important that, you know and trust the person who's providing the guest post and make sure that they can tell you and show you that either one the photos are original.

[00:23:30.760] - Jamie
The words are original. Yes. Exactly. They have those online. Those are fairly simple to do, but just make sure that you're getting original work.

[00:23:43.030] - Liz, Host
Yes. Okay. So, you've mentioned keep track of your licenses, your permission. Do you have any tips on how to keep that organized and how people should kind of keep that you know all that information because it can add up over the years and try later.

[00:24:01.180] - Jamie
For sure. Yeah. So, wherever you save the photo, whatever that organization looks like, and you should save all of your photos. You should not just upload them and then delete them. Wherever you save your photos, save your license next to it. That way they're right there together, whether it's one big giant folder or it's broken up by blog post, however, your assets are saved. Just save the license with the photo. That's the easiest thing.

[00:24:25.210] - Liz, Host
So, you can find it.

[00:24:26.410] - Jamie
Exactly.

[00:24:29.810] - Liz, Host
Screenshot dated 10-2007-19 is a lot harder to dig and find than when you've taken the time to just rename it, 30 seconds. Alright. So, we are running out of time. Is there anything else you think people need to know in terms of mistakes or just in general, copyright trademark.

[00:25:00.030] - Jamie
I think the most important thing is to just not be afraid of it, not run away from it. Find really good resources and just educate yourself a bit about anything else. Like you've learned WordPress. I'm guessing you did not start knowing WordPress. You've also learned how to edit photos. Maybe you were a photographer. You've learned how to blog. View this as just another tool in your toolbox that you need, because this is a business that you're running. If you're here, it means you're making this a business.

[00:25:27.640] - Jamie
And so, it's important to treat it like a business. So, don't run from it. The legal stuff, not just IP, but everything, all the legal stuff, the basics, those foundations are critical for your business. And the sooner that you sort of wrap your head around them, the better. So, I'd say just really sit down strategize with an attorney. Find someone that you trust. Educate yourself, find some really good resources out there and you'll sleep at night because you'll know that you're covered. So that's the biggest piece of advice that I have.

[00:26:00.190] - Liz, Host
Yes. Alright. And then I think you have some resources that would be great for attendees to check out talk and about this.

[00:26:06.180] - Jamie
Yeah. So, we actually do have mini courses that you can check out on contracts, trademark, copyright, privacy, website terms, all kinds of good stuff. We made them really accessible so that you'd be able to at least get that little bit of information. You can find our courses and frankly, information about us. And we have a lot of resources on our website at hashtaglegal.com. The name of our courses are called the uUnbusiness School. So, you'll see a link at the top. You can just click on that and check out our courses.

[00:26:40.570] - Jamie
You also can go to our Instagram where I actually post like lots of videos, lots of information, just quick tips, which is hashtag_legal is our handle, all spelled out, hashtag spelled out and everything. And my YouTube channel is Jamie Lieberman rocks.

[00:26:58.770] - Liz, Host
I love it. Fantastic. So, guys, definitely go check those out. Jamie obviously knows her stuff. I'm probably going to go check some of those out myself because again, trademark copyright, not my jam. Jamie, thank you so much for being here. Any last words, anything you want to add?

[00:27:16.310] - Jamie
Oh, yeah. Thanks for having me. This is great.

Liz Stapleton [00:00:00]:
Hey, guys. Liz Stapleton here. I'm the host of the Blogger Breakthrough Summit, but this session is a little bit more tied to my background. We're gonna be talking about the seven things you need to know to legally protect your blog. And yes, I am an attorney, so I am a licensed attorney. I've been attorney since 2012, yes, eight years. I'm listed in New York and Massachusetts. I've spoken on the topic of blogging and the law at various other conferences.

Liz Stapleton [00:00:27]:
Fincon is an in person conference, some online summits, and I'm also a blogger. I've been a blogger since 2014, which makes me feel kind of like an old blogger. But anyway, I would like to just take a second to remind you to turn off your phone and close your tabs and get rid of any distractions so you can really focus on this session. And I also want to do a quick disclaimer that this is informational and educational purposes only. This isn't legal advice because I don't know your specific situation, so I can't give you legal advice. I'm not liable for anything you do or don't do based on the information I present in this session. So, just covering my backside. And here's what we're going to be covering today.

Liz Stapleton [00:01:13]:
First, we're going to talk about how to properly disclose affiliate relationships for every kind of post. If you're a blogger, you kind of are aware of affiliate marketing. You may already have some idea of sort of what's required in disclosures, but we're going to dig a little bit deeper. All right? We're also going to talk about why you need to have a privacy policy and what you should be including what GDPR is and why it matters, what CCPA is, which is the new privacy law on the block and why it matters. We're going to talk about the legal requirements of email marketing and list building, understanding what terms and conditions are and if you need one for your site. And then finally, we're going to talk about disclaimers to limit your liability and protect your blog. So, I know this could seem overwhelming. I just want to remind you that the legal stuff is important, but doesn't have to be scary or hard.

Liz Stapleton [00:02:02]:
And I'm realizing also that all the photos of me are when I had long hair. So I apologize. I swear it's still me. But let's go ahead and get started, okay? So, how to properly disclose affiliate relationships for every kind of post. So, affiliate marketing, in case you're not aware, although I'm sure you are, is where you are getting paid to refer people to a product when they make a purchase. And FTC. The Federal Trade Commission has requirements on disclosures. Because the thing is, if you're getting paid, you might have some sort of bias.

Liz Stapleton [00:02:35]:
Ideally, we're all giving our honest opinions, but you still have to inform consumers that you are being paid. And language matters, as does where you put the disclosure and size. Okay? So when it comes to language, I know as bloggers we're like, oh yeah, this may contain affiliate links and we know what it means, but we don't realize that that's actually kind of a blogger jargon term. And not everyone knows what affiliate marketing is. And if you think back to before you got into blogging, you probably didn't necessarily know what that meant either. So you need to kind of make sure your disclosure is clear in terms of what you're saying. You also have to make sure your disclosure is above where they would click to click away on the affiliate link, because telling them after the fact when they've already left the page doesn't do them any good. So that's why oftentimes you'll see just at the top of every single blog post for some bloggers, it says, this may contain affiliate links, meaning I'll earn a commission if you click and make a purchase.

Liz Stapleton [00:03:36]:
And you can use the term affiliate marketing or affiliate link if you're explaining what it means, that's fine. So you can't make it like teeny tiny. It needs to be basically the same size as the rest of the text on the page. All right? Okay, so I've already kind of touched on this. You should be putting it above the content. Some mistakes I've seen people make is putting it in the sidebar or the footer. First of all, the footer is a bottom, so no go. But the problem with the sidebar is on a mobile screen, which a lot of users are using phones now, right? If you go to your Google Analytics, how much of your traffic is from mobile users versus desktop? On a mobile screen, the sidebar drops to the bottom of the page, which makes the disclosure after the content.

Liz Stapleton [00:04:21]:
So that's why you don't want to be putting your disclosures in the sidebar. You need to make sure it's above the fold or above the links within the content itself. All right? You also need to make sure you're disclosing social media and the same rules apply. So I see this a lot where especially like Twitter or something or even Instagram, although I see some great examples of how to do it right on Instagram, I think Instagram is really supported. That is, they'll do the post, they'll do the link and they'll do hashtags and they'll include a hashtag ad. The problem with that is that the disclosure is coming after the link and they may not see it. So you want to move that hashtag ad to the very beginning of your post, hashtag ad, copy link the rest of your hashtags, okay? Because you need to disclose it ahead of time. Again, hashtag ad is a much more understandable term than hashtag affiliate.

Liz Stapleton [00:05:12]:
So just keep in mind that language doesn't have to be super complicated. Just try to my kind of rule of thumb that I suggest is if your grandma want to understand it, then it's probably jargony. Okay? And the same thing goes for email marketing. I feel like this is an area that a lot of bloggers, even the ones I know are amazing bloggers and they're professional. They fail to do this. They will put the disclosure at the bottom of their email and it is not okay. Again, the disclosure must be before they can click on the link. So what I do in mine is I just make it the first thing before they even hide your name.

Liz Stapleton [00:05:49]:
I'm just like, hey, this email may contain affiliate links. Meaning if you click and make purchase, I'll get a commission at no cost to you. So just make that the first thing. Don't make it a PS, don't make it at the bottom. It needs to be before the link. If you have like a section where the links are, you could do it just before that section. It doesn't have to be before the entire email, but it must be before they can click to it. Okay? All right, so hopefully you kind of have a better understanding of sort of affiliate disclosures.

Liz Stapleton [00:06:17]:
Now we're going to talk about why you need to have a privacy policy and what to include. Okay, so GDPR came into effect in 2018 and caused a huge splash. But the truth is there are various federal and state laws in the United States that it's like bits and pieces here and there that combined. Basically, say you need a privacy policy. And really the point is to just be open and transparent with the people on your site, okay? Just honest, open. Tell them what you're collecting, why? And chances are, even if you don't think you're collecting data, you are. Because if you allow comments on your site, if you have an email list that you're growing, you're collecting people's data, you're collecting their email address for the email sign up list. If you're using Google Analytics, you may be collecting anonymous data.

Liz Stapleton [00:07:07]:
So if you're using Pixels, Facebook Pixels, whatever, chances are you're collecting data whether you realize it or not. So you do need a privacy policy. Okay, like I said, pretty much everyone is collecting data. For example, various tools for Pixels, links to other sites. These are things that you need to include in your privacy policy. You need to tell them what you're collecting, whether it's personal or anonymous information, information about links to other sites. Because you're going to link to other sites whether they're affiliates or not. They may be affiliates.

Liz Stapleton [00:07:38]:
You need to explain that affiliate relationship. And cookies cookie policy is probably something that's why you always see the pop up banner of the site uses cookies. But also if you're just clicking to other sites, like, hey, I'm not responsible for what they're doing with your information or what information they collect. You need to go look at their privacy policy. You need to let them know when the page was last updated, what your overall cookie policy is and your contact information. Okay. Because people need a way to opt out. We'll get to kind of that in a minute, a way to opt out of that.

Liz Stapleton [00:08:13]:
So they need to be able to contact you. So that could be through a form, but ideally it's providing an email address, and that's because of CCPA, where the email address is, I think, specified. Okay, so hopefully this is making sense so far. I know I do speak quickly, but you can rewatch this. Step three. So let's talk about what GDPR is and why it matters. It stands for the Global Data Protection Regulation, and it's a law that came into effect in May 2018 out of the European Union. And you may think, well, I'm not in the EU.

Liz Stapleton [00:08:43]:
It doesn't apply to me. It's for people located in the EU. So if you're a travel blogger, you could be locating you or your ideal audience could be, or maybe you're a military blogger and there's people based in Europe or something that are in your audience. If you're marketing to people in Europe or in the European Union, then GDPR applies. Okay, we'll talk about CCPA next, because we're only going to see more and more laws like this. So it's easiest to just go ahead and get your site kind of up to snuff, make it compliant so that you're not having to stress every single time something comes out. Okay, like I said, jurisdiction includes sites that have an audience located in the EU. They don't have to be EU residents, they just have to be located there.

Liz Stapleton [00:09:30]:
Okay, like I said, more laws like it are coming. I want to let me talk about GDPR a little bit more. So GDPR came into effect because we had all those data breaches and we wouldn't find out until like years later, and that's kind of BS. And I'm sure you were pissed about it if you were one of those people that got your data breached. And so really what it requires is that you inform people what you're collecting and you get their consent to collect it. And people need to be able to opt out. And that's why things like cookie policies and those notifications are important. Okay, so you need to have consent.

Liz Stapleton [00:10:08]:
The big issue with GDPR is consent to collect information. And one of the biggest ways this hit bloggers was email marketing, because a lot of times the way it used to be is bloggers would offer a freebie in exchange for an email address, while the way the GDPR is written, you can't do that anymore. You can't condition something on requiring their information. So there's different ways to go about it. You can add a checkbox to your email marketing form that says, yes, I consent to receive marketing messages from so and so the way I like best. I read about it from Thrive Themes is to just kind of switch up the offer instead of being like, get your free this, enter your email address below. Instead, say subscribers get access to all these great things, including this sign up if you want it. So that way they're signing up to subscribe and that's just like a bonus that they're getting, okay, they can't sign up for the freebie and then to be added to a newsletter that they signed up for the freebie, not for a newsletter.

Liz Stapleton [00:11:16]:
That's not what they consented to. So it's got to be very specific. So hopefully that kind of makes sense. So CCPA so CCPA is the California Consumer Privacy Act, and it is similar in a lot of ways to GDPR. And chances are if you are complying with GDPR, you don't have to do that much more to comply with CCPA. So really it applies to people that have, I think, 50,000 sessions or users per month from California. So if you're a smaller blogger, it may not technically apply to you, but again, we're just going to see more and more laws like this. So I would just go ahead and take the actions necessary to apply.

Liz Stapleton [00:11:59]:
If you are existing solely online, like your blog is a fully online business, you don't have like a brick or mortar store or whatever, then you just need a way people contact you online with the email address. But one of the bigger differences with CCPA is that they have a rule about selling information, okay? So if you sell information, you have to have a way for people to opt out of that. And that's very explicit. And you need to have something in your privacy policy that is specifically for California residents that says these are your rights under CCPA, here's what you do to enact, but to take advantage of your right, whatever, I'm blanking on the word right now. So you will need that. And you may not think that you're going to sell information, and maybe you never have. If you sold information in the last twelve months, you need to update your privacy policy to say as much how you did that. And if you sold information last twelve months, there's actually quite a bit more you need to do within your privacy policy and things like that.

Liz Stapleton [00:13:02]:
If you've never sold information, and again, sold is this a new law? So does ads count as sold? In my reading of it, I didn't think so, but I've seen other people think so. So we're going to have to kind of wait and see how this plays out in the courts to see to what extent it's going to apply to bloggers. If like, ad revenue is considered selling personal information under CCPA, I'm not that worried about it at the moment. We'll see how this plays out. But one of the sessions, another session in the Summit is Chelsea Clark, who's awesome, and she talked about selling your blog so if that's something you're going to be doing down the road, you're going to need to kind of keep that in mind of you'll be selling information, so just keep that in mind. But yeah, so CCPA sort of applies to I really should line up my slides with my talking a little bit there really applies to people with a California based audience or at least have certain amount of people from California, and you can kind of figure that out in your Google Analytics. We have lots of sessions on analytics and diving in there. But yeah, like I said, requirements CCPA are very similar to GDPR in terms of getting consent, allowing people to opt out, allowing people to say, do not sell my information.

Liz Stapleton [00:14:17]:
Like, you can't include their information and it being sold. If you're selling information, there's a lot more you kind of need to dig in and understand. But hopefully that gives you an idea of CCPA and GDPR. Like I said, it's all about being open and transparent. Tell them what you're collecting, why you're collecting it, and sort of under GDPR, you need to explain what method of consent you're getting. Is it they're opting into the cookie? Is it they're checking a checkbox in your email list? Another form of consent is they're buying something like, you have to collect the information in order to deliver the product or service that they are paying for. That is considered consent. You're like, well, if you paid me for it, I have to give it to you, and I need that information to do it, so that counts.

Liz Stapleton [00:15:02]:
Okay. All right. Legal requirements of email marketing and list building. Okay, this can spam act. So in addition, GDPR out of the EU and CCPA out of California, where you're talking about all sorts of personal information, there's the Can Spam Act that's been around a lot longer. And this is the law that requires you to have an unsubscribe button at the bottom of your email as well as an address. And it cannot be a fake address. Guys, stop using fake addresses.

Liz Stapleton [00:15:27]:
Get a PO. Box. Or if you're with ConvertKit, I think they're the only ones I know of that do this. There might be some others, but they let you use their address. You're consenting to them opening any mail they get on your behalf, but you have to use a real address or you're going to be in trouble, basically. And this is also why you want to be using an email marketing service like ConvertKit or MailerLite or ActiveCampaign. I mean, there's a ton out there. Drip, AWeber, goes on and on.

Liz Stapleton [00:15:59]:
But it's because they make it not only because you can't send 1000 emails on a Gmail account one day, but also because they make it easy to sort of implement those things. You need to be Can Spam compliant that allows people to unsubscribe from your list. Okay, like I said, what to use for your address. It needs to be real. It can be a PO box. Peel boxes are pretty affordable. It varies very much by location, so it might be the one closest to you is expensive, and the one across town is not. But as long as you're willing to go across town once a month to check it, go with a cheaper one, it's fine.

Liz Stapleton [00:16:38]:
But again, must be a real address. Like I said, you can always use your house address, but if you're not comfortable with that, then PO. Box or ConvertKit I believe lets you use theirs. All right. List building GDPR. Okay, so I've already touched on this a bit. Do you really need checkboxes? Potentially. So it kind of depends on how you're framing your offer.

Liz Stapleton [00:16:59]:
I also do want to note that double opt in doesn't necessarily mean consent under GDPR. And the reason I say that is because I do use ConvertKit, and I'm familiar with the platform. I've used them for years, and I love them in a lot of ways, but they have this thing which was awesome before GDPR. But I think many people could get confused about is they have the double opt in, where when they click on the download button, it double opts them, and it confirms them, and so they're clicking to get the freebie. That's not necessarily consent under GDPR. Okay. So if you're like, oh, I've always done double opt in. You need to really think about, okay, what that double opt in looks like, and if it really constitutes the consent that you're perceiving them giving.

Liz Stapleton [00:17:45]:
Okay. But pretty much every email marketing service has a great GDPR compliant type of thing. So ConvertKit lets you do, like, a squeeze page, which is what I use, and you can even say just do it from traffic, from the EU, where after they opt into your form, they're taken to a page. If they're from the EU, it's like, hey, are you cool opting into the email list? It's like yes or no. If no, then you don't email them, but they still get the freebie or whatever. If yes, then you've got that marked consent. And pretty much every email marketing service has something of that sort to help you comply with GDPR. So whatever email marketing service you're using I said I use ConverKit.

Liz Stapleton [00:18:24]:
And actually, they're doing a session here, and they've got a great offer. But whatever you're using, be sure and look into what they have in place to help you comply with GDPR. Okay? All right. Understanding what terms and conditions are and if you need them for your site. Because we've talked about privacy policies, terms and conditions are actually a bit different. So basically, terms and conditions are saying, your site, your rules. Okay. It's like, my house, my rules.

Liz Stapleton [00:18:53]:
Okay. You're not allowed to do this or this or this. I don't have to accept your comments. Even if you buy my products. If you are using them commercial or trying to resell them, then that's not allowed. So they're just setting your house rules and letting people know what they are. In a lot of cases, if you're just blogging, you may not need them, but if you're running a community of some sort or you're selling products, you probably do need some terms and conditions that you're selling them on term that whatever product they're purchasing is for personal use only, things like that. So terms and conditions can also be where you keep your refund policy.

Liz Stapleton [00:19:33]:
Again, if you're selling products or services. So if you're selling things besides like affiliate marketing or ad revenue, if you're selling products, services, things of that nature, chances are you do want some sort of terms and conditions on your site. They can also help to limit your liability of what you're responsible for and what you're not. You can put in your Disclaimers and disclosures, include those in there and just kind of cover your business to protect your business, to make sure people aren't thinking you're an expert in something if you're not and you're just giving your opinion. Kind of like how I put my Disclaimer of, yes, I'm an attorney, but I don't know what's going on with you. So this isn't legal advice. This is informational purposes only. All right? They also terms and conditions allow you to decide where you're going to throw down.

Liz Stapleton [00:20:25]:
So if there's some sort of issue, you need to go to court. You can say in your terms and conditions where that needs to happen. Because if you're located in North Carolina, you probably don't want to go to court in Massachusetts, right? So you can kind of lay down the law of what jurisdiction is going to apply if someone's going to take issue with you and or if you need to take issue, really if someone takes issue with you. Okay. All right, so let's dive a little more into Disclaimers to limit your liability and protect your blog. So there's professional non professional disclaimers, and by professional, I mean like the attorney one. I just did like three times. I'm an attorney.

Liz Stapleton [00:21:02]:
But this isn't legal advice. It's informational educational purposes only. But then there's non professional disclaimers, because my first blog ever again has been slightly neglected lately. I'm going to get back to it, but it's called Less Debt, More Wine and it's on personal finance. But I am not a financial expert. I'm not an accountant. I'm not a financial advisor. And so I have to say that I say that, I say it's like, hey, guys, these are my thoughts, my opinions.

Liz Stapleton [00:21:24]:
I am not in any way licensed in finance. So just so you know, this isn't from a licensed professional in this area. So you could also, if you're like, a nurse or something yes, I'm a nurse, but this is not medical advice. You need to talk to an actual doctor or nurse or whatever you can kind of same idea. Nutrition is an area that comes a lot, fitness, things like that. I think areas I'm thinking of that you might need to include either a professional or non professional disclaimer. Okay. Earnings and testimonial disclaimers, these get overlooked a lot.

Liz Stapleton [00:22:01]:
So one of the best ways to sell a product is to get other people to sell it for you by the way of giving a testimonial, giving feedback and telling people how awesome it is. But you need to have or saying they made X amount of dollars after implementing your system. Right? Those are great things to have, but you need to have earnings and testimonial disclaimers. And really what that does is you're saying, hey, these are all real students. But B, your results are going to depend on the work you put in and I can't guarantee that you're going to reach the same level of success. Like I can't guarantee any sort of level of success for you. There's a lot of factors that go into this. So it's kind of basically spelling that out.

Liz Stapleton [00:22:46]:
All right, and then again bringing it back to where we started. Affiliate sponsored content, you need to make sure that you are disclosing affiliate links but also sponsored content, okay? It's the same idea. It needs to be above. Sponsored content actually needs to be before the content starts. It shouldn't be mixed in somewhere. Affiliate disclosure just needs to be before a link. But sponsored content, you need to disclose. Hey, this blog post is sponsored by so and so, all opinions of my own, whatever.

Liz Stapleton [00:23:14]:
We actually have a whole session on sponsored, on doing sponsored content with Tracy Fobes you should absolutely check out and we talk more about the disclosure there. But just make sure anything that you're getting paid for, you're being open, honest, and transparent about it. That's really kind of what matters. So recapping what you learned. You learned to properly disclose relationships, whether they're affiliate sponsors or otherwise. You learned why GDP matters and GPR matters and how CCPA relates. And that we're just going to see more laws like this coming down the pipeline. So you may as well jump on the bandwagon and get your site compliant.

Liz Stapleton [00:23:51]:
And you saw that disclaimers and disclosures are just as important as everything else you do with your blog. Okay? So take action. Protect your blogging business. Hopefully you've maybe had your mind a little easier, feeling a little more prepared to understand this. It's always the best policy to go to an attorney. Jamie, Hashtag Legal, who's also speaking at the session is great. So Sam Mazzeo, who's a lawyer speaking at the session, it's a personalized privacy policy and everything is always going to be the best solution. Okay? But I recognize that not everyone can afford that.

Liz Stapleton [00:24:28]:
Once you get blog starts earning the money that you can still go do that, but sort of the next best step is to get templates from an attorney, and I do have those. I have a Website Legal Templates Bundle that includes Privacy Policy Terms and Conditions Disclosures disclaimers, and I am offering a $47 discount to all attendees. And that's in the perks section. You guys can go check that out. It makes it $100, which is actually a really good deal. But yeah, they're templates. Keep in mind they are templates, right? They're not personalized. It's kind of like when you get swipe copy for an affiliate launch.

Liz Stapleton [00:24:58]:
There may be things in there that don't apply to your audience or don't quite fit for what you're doing. So it's a general template. It's better than a lot of the free alternatives out there or trying to copy from someone who didn't go to an attorney or whatever, I don't know. But templates from attorney are going to be better. But going to an attorney yourself and gain that person is always going to be best. So just keep that in mind and I hope that helps. And I'll see you guys in the rest of the summit.

All right, everyone. Welcome to How to Legally and Protect Your Online Business & Blog. This is going over some of the stuff that once you started blogging a little bit, you should definitely be aware of this is geared towards intermediate bloggers that have been, are just starting. If you are just starting, make sure you go watch the beginner session. Not that you can't watch this if you're just starting, but I want to make sure you cover the basics in the beginner session first. This is the a little bit more advanced stuff. Who am I? I'm Liz Stapleton. I'm an attorney. I've spoken on the topic of legally protecting your online business at both in-person, conferences, as well as online conferences like FinCon, the Rebel Boss Summit, Niche Investor Summit, and more. I'm a blogger myself, and I'm the host of the summit, if you didn't know that already. You're going to be seeing a lot of me this week, and hopefully, I'll get to know a lot of you as well. I'm really excited to share this information. I started blogging back in 2014 in the personal finance space. I started sharing about the legal side of blogging in 2017, 2018 around there because I saw a lot of scaremongering while I was in this space myself.

[00:01:13.400] - Liz Stapleton, Host
It's just not necessary. So this stuff is super important, but it doesn't have to be scary or hard. We're going to approach it in a way that makes it simple and easy to understand so that you can figure the right steps to take for you. So before we start, I do want to encourage you to just focus. I talk really fast. I'm going to cover a lot of information. I'm going to keep it short and sweet. Just focus for the 20-ish minutes, maybe 25, and turn off your phone, close your tabs, and just be present. Take notes. It's going to be good stuff. Also, before we start, a little disclaimer. While I'm an attorney, I'm not your attorney. Also, before we start, a quick disclaimer. While I'm an attorney, I'm not your attorney. This is not legal advice. This is for informational and educational purposes only. Hopefully, with that information, you'll be able to figure out what the right next step for you is and the right questions to ask. You need to talk to an attorney, but I am not responsible for whatever actions you do or don't take based on what you learn here.

[00:02:11.400] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Like I said, informational educational purposes only. I'm not your attorney. That's it. All right, moving on. Let's go ahead and put your mind at ease. Here's what we're going to be covering today. We're going to talk about if you should be an LLC, as well as the BOI reporting requirements that went into effect in 2024. We're going to talk about the basics of copyright and trademark, when to use AI disclosures, the legal requirements of email marketing, list building. This is going to be a real quick thing because I could actually do an entire session just on that, and I have. But we're going to just cover really quickly some of the most important things. We're going to talk about what terms and conditions are and if you need them. Let's go ahead and get started. Take a deep breath. Remember, the little stuff is important. It doesn't have to be scary or hard. It helps if you think of it as the understanding that most of these laws came into effect because people are being sketchy. I know if you're here, you're not sketchy because I don't roll that way, and the people that hang out with me don't tend to roll that way.

[00:03:08.440] - Liz Stapleton, Host
If you are thinking of it as just being open and honest with your audience, then you're already halfway there. Let's get started. Do you need to be an LLC? An LLC stands for a limited liability corporation, and it's a state-based entity. If you want to be an LLC, and this is in the US, you have to go to your state Secretary of State website and register it to be an LLC. It's a limited liability company, like I said. Single-member LLCs, you're generally taxed the same way as a sole proprietor, but what it can do is it can protect your personal asset. If the company gets sued, generally, they can't go after your personal assets. It does require separation of your business finances and your personal finances. You want to make sure you are keeping those separate, you're not intermingling, that you have a separate business account, which you will you need to get an EIN for. We talked about that a little bit in Katherine Pomerantz's session, which is also going live today. But you pay yourself out of the business account, and then you pay whatever bills you have with your personal account. LLCs, I think LLCs are easy to create.

[00:04:15.860] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Like I said, you go to your Secretary of State's website and look for corporate filing. Usually, there's directions. There is a wide variety of how good Secretary of State's websites are between the 50 states. Some are really awesome, some are not so awesome. Some states, it costs $500 for an LLC, others, it costs $30. So it varies greatly. Some other business formations that you might consider, but you probably need to use in a trying to help you create, could be a Corporation or partnership. A single member LLC can typically be on your own. Since it is state-based, if you want to file in another state, it would be considered a foreign LLC in that state. So just keeping that in mind. Now, If you are not a US resident, some states do make it easier for non-residents to set up an LLC. Some of the advantages that you might consider BOIng that would be credibility, being able to create a PayPal account, because sometimes PayPal is really particular, doesn't let you create a business account or something if you're located in certain places. That could be a reason you might want to do that. Again, everyone's a little bit different.

[00:05:25.040] - Liz Stapleton, Host
But one of the reasons it's important to know or to consider it is because if you do file as a corporate agency, whether that's an LLC, a Corporation, a partnership, then you are going to need to comply with BOI reporting requirements. BOI stands for beneficial owner information. Again, it came into effect to require shady people to stop being shady. It came to effect January 1, 2024. Like I said, while Corporation filing can vary greatly state to state, the BOI helps to set a clear federal standard for incorporation practices. Basically, it wanted to know who is benefiting from this business, who is getting paid from this business? Because I'm sure we've all seen news or you see it on TV all the time, TV shows where it's like, well, it was owned by some shell Corporation that was owned by another Corporation trying We're going to find out who actually owns it in the TV show. It's like a whole thing. With BOI, that has to be a report to the federal government. Who needs to file? Business is registered in the US. An example would be an LLC. If you're just a sole you haven't registered as an entity with the state that you're located in, then you don't need to file a BOI.

[00:06:36.110] - Liz Stapleton, Host
But if you have filed an application to form a corporate entity under the laws of the state or filed for a similar entity formed above the laws of a foreign country to do business in the US by filing a document of a Secretary of State, maybe it's a foreign policy, but like a foreign foreign, not just state foreign, then you would need to file a BOI report. The BOI report info is considered sensitive information. This is what you need to file. It's not a lot. It's not hard. You need your name, date of birth, address, a unique identifying number, so passport or driver's license. When you said it's not publicly available. It will be directly available only to authorize government authority subject to safeguards and control. It has regular auditing, that thing. When do you need to file? If you established your business before January 1, 2024, then you had to have filed by January first, 2025. Obviously, we're watching this. It is the end of January, 2025. If you have not filed, you need to get on that. If you formed in 2024, you had 90 days from the date of your formation to file your BOI report.

[00:07:48.610] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Then, I have to double check, so I'm recording this, guys, at the end of 2024. But the law itself, it's supposed to be you need to file a BOI report within, I think, 30 days of registering your business. If you're registering a business in 2025 and your secretary state should have information of, hey, you need to file this, too. When I redid or renewed my stuff in 2024, I didn't see that. But again, every state is a little bit different. Maybe some states are better than others. If you're filing as a business, make sure you file a BOI report, too. Even if you're behind, better late than ever. They want people to stop being shady. If you're filing stuff, you at least are showing it. You're trying not to. You just say, I didn't know beforehand. No one's out to get you. They really are after people that are trying to flaunt not filing things like that. It's not to say you can't be penalized because there are consequences for not filing. They're both criminal and civil penalties. You could be fined up to $500 for each day the violation continues. It can't be more than $10,000, but that's still a lot of money.

[00:08:55.100] - Liz Stapleton, Host
You could also potentially be in prison for not more than two years or both. File. If you are a registered business in the state where you're located or you are from another country and you're registered in a state, make sure you are filing the BOI report. It's not hard. You just go to fincen.Gov/BOI. It takes five 10 minutes. It's completely free to file. If, like me, like most businesses, you're the sole owner, it's like you and one partner, it's really simple. If you have a complex business structure with lots of potential owners and things then it gets a little more complicated. You might need to pull in some help. But for most of us, pretty simple. Fincen.Gov/BOI. There's actually a lot of great resources on that website as well if you're confused. Okay, so let's go ahead and talk We're going to talk about some intellectual property, the basis of copyright and trademark. We're just going to cover the basics because intellectual property is a very specialized area of law and is not an area that I've specialized in. Nicole Cheri-Oden has spoken at this summit multiple times in the past. She does do copyright and trademark.

[00:10:00.780] - Liz Stapleton, Host
She's awesome. I would say, go check out her stuff if you're looking for someone to actually file these for you. But I am going to just touch on the basics so you can decide. Again, figure out what's going to work best for you. Trademark's purpose is to protect a brand's reputation and inform the customer for what they're getting. When you see the Nike swoosh, you know it's going to be a really good shoe that runs a little narrow. If Joe Schmo, who slapped together a shoe with cardboard and a little glue, put a Nike swoosh on it, you'd be really confused. Just because a trademark can be a mark like the Nike swoosh, it could be a textmark, but it has to be distinguished. There's Dove Chocolate and there's Dove Soap. They're the same name, but they're very different products, and they're both trademarked. So trademarked applies to category, not just the name. That's why you should really always hire an attorney if you want to get something trademarked because it's, again, very specialized. You have to know the categories, things like that. But like I said, there's Lexus, the car, and Lexis Nexis, the legal research company, which they're spelled a little bit differently, but they certainly sound the same.

[00:11:12.240] - Liz Stapleton, Host
They're completely different. There's no chance of confusing one for the other. Same with chocolate or soap. If you go to the store to get soap and you want dove, you're not going to accidentally buy chocolate. I mean, you might accidentally buy chocolate for another reason, but you're not going to get mixed up from the dove aspect. Copyright is making sure you're respectful of what others have created and making sure that the stuff you created isn't being stolen. What's exciting is you don't have to register to claim your copyright or trademark. They apply automatically. But you can't use the R symbol without registering, and there's certain benefits to registering such as statutory damages if someone violates your copyright or violates your trademark. On the flip side, if you're not sure if you can If you want to do something, maybe you want to do a roundup or something, include some recipes, ask. You can't just borrow an image from someone's site, and because you link to it and give attribution, that's still a copyright violation. You have to make sure you have the proper permission. When in doubt, ask. A lot of bloggers will include something in their terms and conditions, especially if it's like food or craft blogger that tends to get included in roundups of like, Hey, you can borrow one image per post so long as you link good proper attribution.

[00:12:29.540] - Liz Stapleton, Host
So some will They actually say it in their terms and conditions because they don't want to deal with a lot of requests in their inbox. You can always check there. But again, when in doubt, ask. The purpose is to protect things you've created from being stolen and vice versa. You don't want to unintentionally infringe on someone else's copyright. One thing that's been shifting in this area a lot, though, is AI. In Thaler versus Perlmutter, it's possible I'm not saying that, human authorship is the bedrock requirement of copyright. Basically, this case answered whether AI work can be copyrighted. Basically, the test is whether the work is one of human authorship with the computer or other device, merely being an assisting instrument, or whether the traditional elements of authorship in the work, that's literary, artistic, musical expression, or elements of selection, arrangement, et cetera, were actually conceived and executed not by the man, but by the machine. Let's take a couple of examples. Let's say you give AI some keywords and ask it to write a blog post. If you take the content produced by the AI and post it as is, it's not going to be protected by copyright.

[00:13:38.470] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Anyone can steal that from you. There's nothing you do because it's AI. It's not copyright protected because in the eyes of the law, you didn't write it and machine did. Now, if you take that same content, produced it, it's a rough draft, and you go through and you make significant edits and you rearrange and you clean up information and make sure it's all factually correct in site to things, then that can be copyright-protected. Because there's the elements of human authorship, of going through making it your own. It has artistic elements of selection, arrangement, things like that. You can use AI as an assistant, but it cannot be the primary thing producing the content. Does that make sense? Like I said, you can use AI when writing blog posts, but you can't only use AI. The thing is, I use AI when I write stuff. I like to use AI on some of my sites. It's about a super duper rough draft or just an overall outline to get me started. The goal is for me when I'm using AI is to get words on a page so that I can avoid staring at a blank page, so to avoid blank page syndrome.

[00:14:56.900] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Then I'll go through multiple rounds of edits and formatting before I get the final version. In that case, a lot of the final content is my own making. I'm just using AI as an assistant, so it should be protected by copyright. All right. Images are where we get a little bit more complicated. It's about the same if you have an image generated and make significant edits, it's possible to have copyright protection. That being said, I think there's going to be a lot more issues with images in terms of copyright and how AI tools train on them. In my opinion, this is my opinion, we haven't seen this come through, but I think artists are going to have an easier time proving. Authors have struggled, but I think artists will have an easier time proving infringement by AI companies and the future of AI image creation will involve potentially licensing deals. Because I've literally seen AI generate images where you can be like, someone's putting a prompt in, do it in the style of this artist, and you can see a warped version of their signature. I think it's going to be much easier for artists to prove infringement.

[00:16:00.930] - Liz Stapleton, Host
My concern is if an AI company is found to have infringed on a visual artist copyright, what does that mean for the image you created? Will you be required to remove it? Will you be required to pay a fee? We just don't know. Personally, I don't touch image generators with a 10-foot pole. That being said, I think AI editing images is great. Background removers, things like that. That's all involving AI, and I think that's fantastic. You're starting with an image that you own or have license to own. Now, if you can't use AI when it comes to images, it's just a little bit more complicated. If it's generated the image, then it's not going to be copyright protected. In that Thaler case, that was actually, someone built the AI to generate an image. Even though they built the machine that then produced the image, built the machine, it was still considered not copyright because it didn't have human authorship. Just keep that in mind. Use it your own risk. Use of AI. The AI Act, which is a proposed e-regulation, and I think is going to set the standard the way GDPR did with data protection back in 2018.

[00:17:13.100] - Liz Stapleton, Host
I believe it went into effect in May or June of last year. Most of the act focuses on businesses that create AI tools, so most of it's not going to apply to content creators. But there is this one section in it that I think everyone should be familiar with. It's this term term called synthetic content. You can see I've quoted it here on the screen. A variety of AI systems can generate large quantities of synthetic content that becomes increasingly hard for humans to distinguish from human-generated and authentic content. It may not be required to comply, but again, it goes towards transparency that you might need to disclose when you're using AI. If there's going to be a significant impact on the integrity and trust in the information ecosystem, that's where synthetic content we've all heard of deep fakes, and that can be really confusing and you're like, Wait a second. It may require disclosure. Very similar to what of course I said regarding the ability to cooperate content involving AI, is also appropriate as similar disclosure obligation in relation to AI-generated or manipulated text to the extent is published with the purpose of informing the public on matters of public interest, unless the AI-generated content has undergone the process of human review or editorial control in a natural or legal person holds editorial We're responsible for the publication of content.

[00:18:33.280] - Liz Stapleton, Host
If it's copyright-protected, then you may not need to disclose, but it doesn't hurt to just be transparent in how you use AI or don't use AI. It's also a great way in disclosing, staking your claim on your copyright. One example I like to share, Layla, who is going to be one of our fantastic panelists during the summit. In her emails, she had this thing that said, This is drafted with care and occasional typos by me, not AI. Like I said, in addition to transparency, when you're sharing how you're using AI to create content, a disclosure regarding AI can demonstrate copyright ownership. It can put people on notice that they can't scrape your content because it's copyright-protected. It just helps to distinguish what is copyrighted content and what isn't. All righty, we got to really get moving now. Let's go ahead. We're going to talk about email marketing and list building because we don't want you to get kicked off of your email marketing service, whether that's Kit, whether it's Flodesk. There's so many out there now. I do love Kit. But basically, there are some laws that govern this. And CANspam is the big one that requires you to allow people to opt out from receiving emails from you.

[00:19:49.670] - Liz Stapleton, Host
This is why you need email marketing service because you can't just be using your Gmail account to email a bunch of people because they need to be able to opt out. GDPR requires specific consent for the types of content you send. So product updates versus newsletter, just because someone bought a product doesn't mean they agree to be on your newsletter and receive other marketing messages. Just keeping in mind, those are the two big things and just practicality. Gmail is not going to let you send an email to a thousand people. Here are some things you want to make sure you do. You want to make sure you're getting consent for the emails you want to send. And double opt-in doesn't necessarily work. So ConvertKit, which I do love, or Kit, as it's now known, it was known for being created by a blogger for bloggers. Back then this thing called a lead magnet or content upgrade, which still what it's called and still works well, but it works a little differently, was great because you'd say, Hey, give me your email. I'll give you this thing. The way Kit did it is their double opt-in email, their confirmation email, in order to download the thing, they had to click the button that confirmed that they wanted to receive the email.

[00:20:58.380] - Liz Stapleton, Host
So the double opt-in and deliver three was like a two for one. But that is not necessarily compliant with how GDPR is laid out. You just have to be very careful with that. I don't have time to go into the details. I do have a free GDPR guide that I will make sure to include below this video, but just keep that in mind. Something else you need to do is you need to use a real address in your email marketing service, so you can't use a fake address. You have to use a real address or to comply with the CanSPAM act. Now, it doesn't have to be your house address. You could get a PO Box, Kit, I know lets you use their address. If you've ever seen the 15 Cherry Street, Seattle or whatever, that's someone using Kit's address because they let their customers do that. But you do need a real address. Okay, moving on. I think finally, this last thing we're going to talk about is understanding what terms and conditions are and if you need them. Terms and conditions are basically your way of saying, My site, my rules, and if you don't like it, you can It also lays out various payment and refund policies that people should agree to if they're going to purchase from you.

[00:22:07.150] - Liz Stapleton, Host
But it's laying down the law of your site. It's your domain, literally. Some of the things you might cover in there is a limitation of liability. You're not perfect, neither is your site. You don't get sued because you didn't tell your reader that. You could also decide where to throw down. If someone's going to come after you, you can say, It's got to happen in my home state or wherever. I'm in Washington State, I would not want to have to go defend a lawsuit in Florida or Delaware or whatever. You can say, You got to come to me if we're going to have to do this. Those are some of the things that you would cover. Refunds, like I said, limitation of liability They decided where to throw down, jurisdiction, things like that. That is very short and sweet, very basic information that you guys should be aware of. There's a few of the things, but we are going to run out of time. I do want to, like I said, I take 20, 20, five minutes. We're going to do a quick recap. This is what you guys learned in this session. You learned the legal requirements of email marketing and list building.

[00:23:06.200] - Liz Stapleton, Host
We talked about terms of additions, what they are, and hopefully you have some idea that if you need them, they're going to be super important. If you sell traditional products, you may be able to hold up on them before that, depending. It varies. We talked about why you don't necessarily have to file for copyright and trademark. We talked about how an LLC might be beneficial and filing your BOI report. We also touched on AI disclosures and why you might want to include them. Now, we're going to talk about putting it all into action. If you don't already have these things on your site, which you want a privacy policy, a terms and conditions page, and disclosures and disclaimers page, most likely, then you need to get them. Here's a rundown of what's included in your privacy policy. There is a default WordPress privacy policy. Lastly, checked includes this stuff that's in white, but not this other stuff. This is what you should include in your terms and conditions, revisions and errors, use license, some of the stuff we have time to get into in detail, but we touched on some of it. There's no default terms and conditions page, unfortunately.

[00:24:13.810] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Then disclosures and disclaimers page, again, we touched on this a little bit, but not a lot. I cover it more in the beginner session. So even if you've been blogging for a while, these concepts are new to you, go watch the beginner session. It's also very short and sweet, but it gets to the point. And again, there's no default. So what are your options, really? Do you have to hire an attorney? And no, you don't. The best option, if you can afford it, because I know hiring an attorney can be cost-prohibitive, and I say that as someone who does not offer these services, so I'm not looking for you to hire me because I don't do it. I don't want to. I want to help you, but I don't want to run a law firm. If you can afford it, absolutely hire an attorney. That's always going to be your best bet. The next best option is going to be to grab legal templates from someone who understands the online space and is an attorney and can write those. I'm not going to now go into a big long pitch about mine. Yes, I have some, but there's a lot out there, fortunately.

[00:25:14.630] - Liz Stapleton, Host
When I started teaching on this, there were not a lot of us, and now there's more and more, and it's fantastic. I do love mine. I do think they're great. I am going to share screenshots of what people have said about them. They do come with a generator. They're awesome, and I have a special deal for you guys this week. But I'm just going to scroll through these pages real quick, and we're going to get to here where I'm going to say, Thank you so much for watching. I do have a free gift for you guys. I normally charge about $30 bucks for this, but it's my Smart Bloggers Guidebook to the Legal Side of Blogging. You can grab access to it for free this week only while this summit is live. Elizabethstapleton.Com/go/2025bbs. It goes over what we talked about as well as what I'm going over in the other legal sessions. It's just, like I said, a sessions. It's just a little smart guidebook for you to be able to reference a few questions and need to figure out your right next steps. If you guys have questions, I'm in the chat below and I'm happy to do my best to answer them.

[00:26:12.330] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Have a great rest of the summit and I will be seeing you guys around.

[00:00:03.650] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Hey, everyone. Welcome to the session of the Blogger Breakthrough Summit. I'm super excited to have you. I'm going to be covering the basics of legally protecting your online business. So this session is geared towards beginner bloggers, newer bloggers. It's not saying that if you've already started, if you haven't taken care of your legal stuff, you should definitely watch this. And you can certainly watch the intermediate and advanced sessions. I will be teaching later in the day. But this is really just going over the basics. So if you're wondering who I am, I'm Liz Stapleton. I'm an attorney, I'm a blogger, and I'm the host of this summit. And I'm super excited that you're here. I started my very first blog back in 2014, so over 10 years ago, and it was in the personal finance space. I then in 2017, 2018, saw a lot of scaremongering in the online business space about the legal side of things, which is just completely unnecessary. The legal stuff is super, super important, but I'm a firm believer that doesn't have to be scary or hard. I've been writing on that and helping bloggers and all my business owners with the legal side of stuff since 2017, 2018 over at elizabethstapleton.com.

[00:01:13.480] - Liz Stapleton, Host
And then in 2019, I got the idea to start the Blogger Breakthrough Summit. The first one was held in February 2020. I'm super excited to be here hosting it for the sixth time. Let's go ahead and dive in. Before we start, I do just want to encourage you to turn off your phone, close any other tabs and get rid of distractions. Like I said, this stuff is super important. It doesn't need to be scary or hard, and we're going to make it super approachable and easy to understand. But you need to focus on how to do that. Next up, I do just have a quick disclaimer. Nothing presented here is legal advice. While I have a background as an attorney, I'm not your attorney. This is for informational and educational purposes only. It's not legal advice. You may need to talk to a lawyer to get specific answers, but this should hopefully get you started that you know the right questions to ask if you have to ask questions. Let's go ahead and put your mind at ease. Here's what we're going to cover today. We're going to talk about why you need to have a privacy policy and what you should include.

[00:02:10.810] - Liz Stapleton, Host
We're going to talk about various data privacy laws, what they are, why they matter, Talk about how to properly disclose affiliate relationships for every piece of content. Then finally, we're going to talk about what you should know about disclaimers in order to limit your liability and protect your blog. Let's get started. Take a deep breath. Like I said, super important, but it's not going to be scary or hard. We're going to make this easy. All right, so why do you need to have a privacy policy? Basically, a lot of laws, and this is just a good general understanding, a lot of these laws that you have to comply with exist because people were being shady. If you approach it and think of it of, Okay, how can I be open, honest, and transparent with my audience? In most cases, that's going to be doing what you need to do to comply. There's various federal and state laws in the US and international laws such as the General Data Protection Regulation, which out of the EU and does potentially apply, even if you're based in the US. That says you need to tell people what you're doing with the data if and when you collect it.

[00:03:11.330] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Again, it's about being open and transparent, which is a great way to build trust with your audience and just let them know what you're up to. If you think you're not collecting data, I'm going to encourage you to think again, because pretty much everyone, every website owner is collecting some data. For example, if you're using Google Analytics, you're collecting data. If you do email marketing, you have forms on your site, you're collecting email addresses and names, potentially. If you have a contact form, if you allow comments, these are all examples of data. If you have any pixel tracking for Facebook ads or Pinterest or things like that, those are all examples. It's pretty hard to run a website and a blog and online business successfully without collecting data. Basically, your privacy policy is your place where you explain what data you collect, how you collect it, why you collect it, and under what provision of consent you are collecting or if you need consent. Here are the things you're going to be including your privacy policy. You want to make sure you're providing clear, understandable, and transparent information to consumers about how their data is being used.

[00:04:12.250] - Liz Stapleton, Host
So information you collect, whether it's personal, anonymous, what tools you use that might be storing that data. If you have display ads, what does that look like? Is that data collected? Just keeping those things in mind. Your cookie policy, affiliate relationships, California Residence Rights Contact information. Your contact information is required on your privacy policy. It could be contact page. It doesn't necessarily have to be an email address, but you need to have something on there. You should also be including when the page was last updated and how long you keep whatever data it is you collect. So these are the things that will go into your privacy policy. And we'll cover this more at the end. There is a default privacy policy in WordPress. It's a great starting point. You're also going to explain how How consumers or your audience can exercise their consumer rights in terms of opting out of things or turning down cookies and things like that. So like I said, we'll go over this some more. But let's We're going to go ahead and talk a little more about the various data privacy laws and what they mean. The biggest and most well known is GDPR, which is the General Data Protection Regulation.

[00:05:25.460] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Part of the reason is a lot of laws today are behind on technology. We're seeing more and more laws coming up regarding data privacy as they catch up to the times and the online world that we live in. GDPR came out of the European Union. It went into effect in 2018. Since then, there's been the California Consumer Protection Act, where basically all these laws are just requiring you to inform users of the data you collect and the rights they are entitled to. GDPR is a great standard. If you are complying with GDPR, you're in shape to just go ahead to meet whatever necessary requirements, new laws, particularly in the states, because that's going on a state-by-state basis are requiring. GDPR applies to anyone who has an audience based in the EU because it's the rights of those EU residents that you have to respect. And not even residents, they just have to be located in the EU. So yes, it's going to apply if you yourself are based in the EU. But if you have an audience located in the EU, maybe you're a travel blogger, right? And you have posts on traveling to Spain while people in France are traveling to Spain.

[00:06:36.710] - Liz Stapleton, Host
That's going to apply. Or maybe you're a military blogger. Well, are people located not on the base, but out in France, stuff applies. GDPR is a great standard to try to hold yourself up to. I have a whole GDPR guide that I will be sure to link to below this video that can help you with understanding GDPR and what you need to do to comply. But there's actually been a lot of other laws passed, particularly in the States. CCPA, pretty well known at this point, Brazil's data privacy law, Colorado, passed one that went into effect July of '23, Connecticut, same thing, Delaware. These are ones that are Coming into effect this year, next year are in bold. Except Utah because that's 2024, and Virginia, which was 2023. But for the most part, so coming into effect this year, we have Delaware, we have Iowa, Maryland, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Nebraska, and Tennessee. So it's all come into effect this year. Most of them actually came into effect this month, and a couple going into effect in 2026 as well. And I'm sure we're going to continue to see more and more states pass data privacy laws.

[00:07:50.680] - Liz Stapleton, Host
And if you're wondering, why do they keep doing this? I'm sure you remember the time, it's not as common these days, but way back when so and so had a data breach two years ago and they just told their customers. We've all seen those headlines. This is why these laws are coming into effect. Next, you have to figure out if they apply to you. Scope and applicability. Generally, a scope clause is laid out like this in each of these laws, because all the laws are pretty similar, but it does vary state by state. Conducts business in the state, and then it's either or. You control or process the personal data of not less than 35,000 For some states it's up to 100,000 consumers. Or you control and process at least 25,000 state residents and derive more than 50% of your gross revenue from the sale personal data. So sale personal data does include revenue from display ads. So this might apply to you if you make a lot with display ads and you have an audience. If you've got lots and lots of page views, if you're one of those people that has 100,000 page views or more, depending on if it's super localized or not, this might apply to you.

[00:09:06.790] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Like I said, the OR clause, this part, really varies state by state. Some states, it's as low as 10,000 and does the % gross revenue as low as 20%. It varies state by state. You should definitely do a little Google search if you are located in one of those states that I showed you and see if this is going to apply to you. Okay? Sometimes the law only applies if the business is making in excess of a certain amount. In Florida, their Data Privacy Act only applies if you make in excess of a billion dollars. They're going after Disney. They're not going after you. And in Tennessee, it's like if the business makes more than 5 million. A lot of times it'll exclude personal data that's processed for the purpose of completing payment transactions. So it's not counting the data for all the purchases people made from you. Some states, like Nebraska and Texas, exclude small businesses from having this apply. And the small business is typically defined by the US SBA. They're like, Whatever that's the definition, That's what we mean. Which currently, the SBA defines a US small business as organized for profit, has a place of business in the US, operates primarily within the US, or makes a significant contribution to the US economy through payment of taxes or use of American products, materials, or labor, is independently owned and operated, is not dominant in its field on a national basis.

[00:10:36.500] - Liz Stapleton, Host
It's a pretty broad definition, but I'd say most of us probably fall into that category. All right. What do What do you need to do to comply with all the various state requirements? Basically, you need to have an updated privacy policy that covers all the things we talked about. You need to make sure if you have an email list that you have the proper consent to be emailing them. You should probably install and activate a cookie banner depending on what tools you're using. Set up a way for consumers to opt out of the sale personal information and also have a contact page on your site. So these are things you should be doing. A couple of things you shouldn't be doing is you shouldn't be blocking traffic from locations that have data privacy laws, and you shouldn't charge different rates for those that do or do not exercise their rates. Just don't be a jerk. Don't block yourself. Let's move on. Now we're going to talk about affiliate disclosures because affiliate marketing is one of those things that even if you're brand new, you can get started with. You can start applying to affiliate programs and putting affiliate links on your site so you can start earning passive income.

[00:11:37.630] - Liz Stapleton, Host
It may take a while before that income actually starts to happen, but it's one of those things that you can do foundationally. We want to make sure that you aren't earning those potential earnings or future earnings at risk by ensuring you're properly disclosing your affiliate relationship for every content. The FTC, the File of Trade Commission in the US, is what regulation this and says what is an appropriate disclosure. The language matters. These are the key elements you want to look at. Language matters. A lot of times I see this, people will just post at the top of their blog post saying, This post contains affiliate links. However, that's not enough because not everyone knows what affiliate marketing is. Think about it. Before you got into this world, did you know what that term meant? It's very much like a term in our niche in this whole online business world, and a lot of other people don't know what it means. If you're going to use the term affiliate link, you need to then explain what it means. As a good rule of thumb, I like to say if your grandma want to understand it, then it's not clear enough.

[00:12:39.990] - Liz Stapleton, Host
So a better example would be something like, this post contains affiliate links, meaning I earn a commission if you click through and purchase through my link, something like that. So it's explaining what that term affiliate link means. Another key element is the position on the page matters. So your disclosure has to be before they can click on the link, period. So don't put it in the sidebar because a lot of people view things on mobile and on mobile, sidebars are pushed down to the bottom, which means then it would not be compliant. So this applies not just to blog posts, but it applies to emails. I see this mistake made a lot in email marketing where people just include an affiliate disclosure at the bottom of their email and that is not compliant. It has to be before they can click on the link. So make sure. And then size matters. You can't make your disclosure teeny tiny. It needs to be the same size as whatever your normal text on the page is. Okay? So we're going to keep going. If you guys have questions, be sure to comment below. I will be in the comments to answer those questions.

[00:13:45.190] - Liz Stapleton, Host
All right. Now let's talk about it's easy enough in an email and a blog post to disclose. You're not limited by characters, but social media is its own beast. Where do you put those affiliate disclosures in social media posts? It still has to be before the link. It should also not be in a group of hashtags. I know hashtags are going out of style, but it can't be buried in a sea of hashtags. Because characters are sometimes limited, the FTC knows this, and they actually have a great guide on disclosing in social media. They suggest using terms people understand. So #ad, #sponsored, #paidpartner. And some platforms even let you place a setting that shows it's a paid partnership. Instagram does that, I know for sure. So just making sure you're disclosing that affiliate relationship. And the reason you want to do that is because people have right to know if you're going to get paid for what you're saying. Even if you're not letting that influence what you would say, they still need to know. And that's why the FTC requires this. All right, so like I said, I already touched on this, but it needs to be before the link.

[00:14:53.370] - Liz Stapleton, Host
One thing I like to do for my email broadcast, and I would suggest others do too, if they I have trouble remembering the language or whatnot, is I use Kit, formerly Convert Kit, and what I do is I create a content snippet of my affiliate disclosure, and that way I can just easily pop it in there for the stuff that contains affiliate disclosures. But again, don't put your disclosure at the bottom of your email. It has to be before they can click on the link. Let's move on. What to know about disclaimers to limit your liability. Disclaimers are a little bit different than disclosures. Let's talk about the difference.  Disclosures is where you're making sure the reader is informed of something, for example, that you have an affiliate relationship. Whereas a disclaimer, you're telling your readers that you're not responsible for something. I did it at the beginning of this session where I was like, I may be an attorney I'm not your attorney. This is informational educational purposes. I'm not responsible for what you then decide to do with this information is really what that amounts to. A disclaimer is just a little bit different from a disclosure, but you often find them on the same page.

[00:16:02.170] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Let's go ahead and go through some examples of disclaimers that may apply to you depending on what you're doing. The first one I like to touch on is a professional and nonprofessional disclaimer. If you blog in a specialized area, you need to let your reader know any qualifications you have or are missing. This is important to SEO in terms of EEAT, which is E-E-A-T. I'm going to let you guys watch the SEO sessions on that. But an example is this. If you remember, I started in the personal finance space. My first blog is personal finance, but I am not a personal finance professional. I'm not an accountant. I'm not a financial advisor. I'm just somebody who is sharing their experience with personal finance. I had no expertise in that area. That's why I said, Hey, this is information that I've learned, that I've put together, that I'm sharing, but I'm not an expert. I disclosed that or disclaimed, Hey, I'm not a professional. You might want to talk to one. Another Another area you see this a lot is in health and wellness. Fitness might be one. Like I said, money, legal, licensing, things like that.

[00:17:11.410] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Those are some areas where if you don't have any professional qualifications, you should say so, so they know who they're learning from. And if you do, say so too, like I did here. Hey, I may be an attorney, but I'm not your attorney. So both professional and nonprofessional disclaimers are two sides of the same coin. Moving on. Earnings and testimonial disclaimers. Now, if you're just starting out, this may not apply to you, but if you get to the point where you're selling digital products and you're using testimonials to help sell them, or maybe you're putting together blog income reports because those are always fun to read. Then you need to make sure you're including an earnings and/or testimonial disclaimer. Basically, you're saying you can't promise they're going to achieve the same results. Everyone's a little bit different. Circumstances change, things like that. You just need to say, Hey, these are examples of what is possible, but I can't guarantee that you're going to achieve this. That's what those are doing. Let's go ahead and recap what we talked about. We talked about how to properly dispose affiliate relationships, and the same goes for sponsored or otherwise.

[00:18:18.050] - Liz Stapleton, Host
We talked about various data privacy laws and why they matter and how to comply. We talked about what disclaimers are and how to use them to your advantage. And we talked about why you need a privacy policy and what to include in it. We're going to talk about next, putting it into action. From the very start, you should have these pages on your site. Even if you're a brand new blogger, you're going to want a privacy policy page and then a disclaimers and disclosures page. Here, again, is what you're going to include in your privacy Privacy Policy. This will be available in a checklist that I'll link below. Then this is the... Last I checked, the default WordPress privacy policy for using WordPress includes these things in white. It doesn't necessarily have these other things, but it's a great place to start. Then these are different disclosures and disclaimers you might want to consider including. I did put some asterisks here just because these are maybe ones you don't need from the start. You might need a professional or nonprofessional disclaimer. I talked about a general disclaimer that's always good of like, Hey, I'm not responsible for your actions, and things like that.

[00:19:24.300] - Liz Stapleton, Host
We didn't dig into these too much, but those are things you'll likely want to include as well. All right, so how do you pull this stuff together? Do you have to hire an attorney? You're just starting out. Maybe you don't have money to do that, and that's fine. If you can afford to hire an attorney, that's always going to be your best option. I'm saying this as someone who does not offer those services. But if you can afford to hire an attorney, that's always going to be your best option. The alternatives is start with the default WordPress privacy policy and then cross your fingers for a bit. You can cobble together other policies using various sources or the internet. Never just copy someone's because you don't know that it really applies to you properly. And then there's copyright issues and all that jazz. And you might have actually some templates that you've gotten in bundles and whatnot, and you may be able to cobble something together. That's always an option. I think one of the best options is to grab legal templates written by a lawyer that understands blogging. And when I started in this space, there weren't a lot of us, but fortunately, there are now.

[00:20:24.170] - Liz Stapleton, Host
So yes, I have some. I'm not going to do some big pitch on my templates, but there's a lot out there, and you might already have some, and that's great. But this is a great, I think, medium place. If you can't afford an attorney and you're just starting out, find an attorney that sells legal templates and understands this world. Not all of them do. I will say, well, I'm not going to do a pitch. I will say, I really like them, and I think they're awesome, and they come with a generator and all that jazz. Here's just some positive things that people have said about them. Thank you for being here. I do have a gift for you guys, which hopefully is showing in the video in the recording, it's deciding to not show. We'll see. But I'm going to give you guys my Smart Bloggers Guidebook to the Legal Side of Blogging. I usually sell this for like $30 bucks thereabouts. You can get it completely free this week. While the summit's live, just go to elizabethstapleton.com/go/2025bbs, and you can get that for free. It not only covers the stuff that I went over today, but it covers accessibility, it covers AI, some of the other topics I'll be covering in the other legal sessions for the summit.

[00:21:33.800] - Liz Stapleton, Host
It's just a nice general guidebook on the legal side of blogging. If you guys have any questions, I am in the chat and I'm happy to hang out for a little bit. I hope you found this helpful. I hope you're not feeling overwhelmed and that you feel like this is approachable and you have some ideas of the right next steps for you. Again, thank you guys for coming. Maybe I'll see you at the other legal sessions, maybe not. I don't know, but I'll definitely see you around the summit because I am the host and I'm going to be all over the place. Have a great rest of your day and enjoy the rest of the sessions.

**Transcript:**
[00:00:13.250] - Liz
In this video, I'm going to share with you why disclosure statements are important for your blog and or website, as well as what they should include and where they should be displayed. Alright, so let's dig into it. Why do you need disclosures on your blog? If you're like most bloggers, then you're probably monetizing your site in some way. You're likely using one, if not more of the following you're using ads, affiliate links, email list, sign up forms to market to them.

[00:00:38.570] - Liz
Or you're selling products. And certain laws and regulations apply, so Federal Trade Commission here in the US, if you're a US based blogger, has rules, particularly surrounding sponsored content and affiliate links. I just want to do a quick Disclaimer while I am an attorney, I am not your attorney. This video is just for informational purposes only. I want to help you understand why you need disclosures on your site and help you to get there. But if you do have questions, you know you need to talk to a lawyer in your specific state.

[00:01:09.170] - Liz
I mean, it's a general question. I hopefully will be able to answer you, but heads up. This is not like me, your lawyer. Okay, so let's get back into it.

[00:01:17.710] - Liz
What is required for disclosure? So, for affiliate links, you need to disclose before they could possibly click on the link, and it needs to be clear and concise. So, just saying affiliate link isn't enough. SGC has said a lot of people don't understand what that means, so it's not a good enough disclosure. Kind of think of it this way.

[00:01:36.920] - Liz
If your grandmother wouldn't understand what it was, then it's probably not clear enough. So, saying something like affiliate link is not good enough. But saying something like this post may contain affiliate links, which means I'll be compensated if you purchase something through the link, would be okay. Alright. And it needs to be above the link.

[00:01:55.810] - Liz
So, some people will put their disclosure in, their affiliate disclosure in a Sidebar. And that's not good enough because a lot of people are using mobile when they're looking at websites, and typically the sidebar content gets pushed underneath the post content like the blog post, and then the sidebar content, which would mean that the disclosure is after the links. So, chances are you don't want to put your general disclosure in the Sidebar. You want to put it before the link somewhere in your post. Alright.

[00:02:25.100] - Liz
I'm just going to show you sort of one simple and easy way to insert disclosures and disclaimers easily into posts or pages without like having to always copy and paste and remember. And I got this tip from Grayson Bell, I Mark Interactive. So, I'm going to go to plugins and I'm going to go to add new.

[00:02:52.190] - Liz
I'm going to search for ad inserter, alright, install. Okay, and activate. Okay. So, now when I go to a good tool, no, settings. If I go to add inserter, in this block, I can type in my disclaimer, right. Okay. Scroll down.

[00:03:27.430] - Liz
So, I can say that I want to impose and I can say individually disabled or enabled. So, if I do individually disabled it'll, display it on all posts. Okay. If I do individually enabled, it will only display it where I choose to. And I can also say where I want it to be.

[00:03:47.410] - Liz
So, I can do before post content, after you know certain paragraphs of own, do it like after three paragraphs. It's not the first thing people see. But remember, if you're doing it after three paragraphs, you can't have any affiliate links in those first three paragraphs. So, just something to think about.

[00:04:01.860] - Liz
Okay. And then, like alignment center left, whatever, and then hit save.

[00:04:10.430] - Liz
Alright. I'm going to go to this. This is basically a blank website. So, you're not seeing a whole lot. So, if I go to edit this post, which is just like the standard welcome exist, there's now an add inserter widget on the back end, and I can say go ahead and enable this.

[00:04:29.920] - Liz
Okay.

[00:04:33.210] - Liz
Alright. So, now I've actually added some paragraphs in there. I've got these paragraphs and then I've got my disclosure in here. So, it's really simple to do. And you could do that for multiple disclosures, right.

[00:04:45.870] - Liz
So, I'm an attorney, so I might have that attorney disclaimer that I can individually enable on certain posts because it doesn't necessarily apply to all my posts. So Adsense is a great easy way to do it. If you have, like, Genesis plugin or whatever you can do like a hook. I've never used that tool, so I don't know how to do that necessarily, but there's also ways to do it. This is just one simple, easy way if you're not sure how to do it.

[00:05:13.100] - Liz
So, you can easily add it to all posts automatically or just do it to enable, then add insert or plug in is a great way. I'm going to show you how you can quickly add any, in most cases, like the affiliate disclosures or just other disclosures or disclaimers you need to include in your email marketing. So, we're inside the market, it's what I use. There's a couple of different ways you can do this. The first way is with email templates, and you can see I've got a few different ones here.

[00:05:43.170] - Liz
And this is one that already has the affiliate disclosures what I use most of the time. So, it's just got it at the top. You can see the default content. Let's go ahead and create a new one, so you can see how you do this. So, when you hit create a new one, it'll give you some sort of template.

[00:06:02.400] - Liz
I like to keep it simple. I think it works best. The deliverability, I can talk of it seems to be better. So, if I just go here and let me just make sure I've got the right disclosure copy.

[00:06:20.370] - Liz
All right. Let's see if I can. There we go. And I like to italicize it all right. So, if I hit save or name it, I can then use it and I'll show you in a minute how to do that.

[00:06:40.610] - Liz
The other way you can do this is with a content snippet, so your disclosure doesn't actually have to be at the top of your email. It just needs to be before any affiliate links. So, if you don't want it at the top of the email, another way to make sure you're including it and not having to like type it is just to use a content snippet. So, I've got one here. I can just create a new snippet and then hit save.

[00:07:17.330] - Liz
So, when I go to broadcast and I go to create a new one, let me use this one. There's a couple of ways I can do it, so I can either add in the snippet disclosure short code, or if you're using the newer editor in ConvertKit, there will be like a plus sign and you can go to snippets and then select it. Alternatively, I could select my affiliate email. So, if I preview this, so because I use the affiliate email template, it's showing it at the top, and then I also have it here where I'm going to put, for example, affiliate links.

[00:07:58.430] - Liz
I just want to do regular, though the snippet would still work.

[00:08:02.420] - Liz
So, those are two ways with in ConvertKit that you can easily insert any disclosures or disclaimers you need. And I would assume other platforms have some similar functionality. I'm pretty sure most have some sort of email template that you can use even if they don't have the content snippet. So, hopefully, that helps. And if you guys have questions, let me know.

[00:00:12.250] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Hi, guys. Welcome to this session on legally protecting your digital product sales for the 2025 Blogger Breakthrough Summit. I'm super excited to be here sharing this information with you. In case we haven't met before, I'm Liz Stapleton. I'm actually the host of the summit, so you're going to be seeing a lot more of me this week. But when I'm I'm not hosting the summit. I also run a few other sites. I started out my online journey back in 2014 with a personal finance site because law school was not cheap. And eventually, I segued or started in addition to talking about the legal side of running an online business and blogging because I saw there was a lot of scaremongering happening in this area, and it's just uncalled for. It's not necessary. The legal stuff is super important but doesn't have to be scary or hard. I've been educating on the legal side of running an online business since 2017, 2018. So several years now I've spoken on it at in-person conferences as well as virtual summits, not just ones I run, but other people's too. So yeah, I'm a blogger, I'm an attorney, I'm the host of the summit, and I'm super excited to share this information with you.

[00:01:12.550] - Liz Stapleton, Host
This session is geared more towards advanced bloggers, but it doesn't mean you have to be advanced. It's always good to know and be aware of things that might come up later as you grow. So if you're watching this and you're newer, that's fine too. But I'm definitely excited to share this information with you, particularly if you are selling digital products. So Before we start, I do just want to encourage you to turn off your phone, close your other tabs, get rid of any distractions. As you will learn with this summit, each of the sessions are jam-packed. So to get the most out of it, you need to really pay attention. The sessions are generally short and sweet. I've kept mine to like 25 minutes max. Some of the others are a little longer, but I talk really quickly as well. You will want to pay attention to get the most out of this and take some notes. Before we start, I do have a little bit of a disclaimer. I'm an attorney, I'm not your attorney. This is not legal advice. I don't know your current circumstances, and chances are I'm not licensed where you live.

[00:02:04.850] - Liz Stapleton, Host
The information in this session is for informational and educational purposes only. I'm not responsible for what action or inaction you take based on what you learn. Again, informational, educational purposes only. It may be that you need to go see and speak to an attorney in your jurisdiction to help you figure out exactly what's going to be right for you. But with that disclaimer out of the way, let's go ahead and talk about what we're going to learn today. Like I said, legal stuff, super, super important. It does not need to be scary or hard. We're going to approach it from the fact that you are an awesome business owner and you care about your customers. And so you always want to be open and transparent. If that's the way you are, you're already halfway there. A lot of these laws exist because of people being shady. And so if you're not shady and you're just doing things openly, transparently, you're probably complying with a lot of things already. So let's first talk about what terms and conditions are and if you need them. Then we're going to touch on the basics of copyright and trademark.

[00:03:02.140] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Some of this I did cover in the intermediate session. If you watch that one, this is a bit of a repeat, but one new thing that I will be talking about is the new FTC rule on recurring subscriptions. At the time of recording this, I'm We're running this towards the end of 2024. It hasn't officially gone into effect. It should next month and completely by April 2025. However, it might face some legal challenges. So this is going to be based on the as it stands now, my understanding and what it looks like. And it may change a little bit, but I want to make sure everyone's aware of this. So let's go ahead and get started. Take a deep breath. Remember, like I said, it doesn't have to be scary or hard. We're awesome business people and we want to do right by our customers, so we're already halfway there. All right. So in case you didn't know, terms and conditions are your way of saying my house, my rules. They're basically the rules that you set for people to purchase from you. You see those signs that say no shirt, no shoes, no service.

[00:04:00.940] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Those are some of their terms and conditions. So your site, your rules. It lays out different things. Yes, it's who you serve and who you may choose to not. But also any refund policies you have, any payment policies you have, if they sign up for a subscription versus a split pay, and what is the refund policy for when and all that jazz, where if there's an issue, stuff has to be addressed, what jurisdiction. Limit your It's a liability because you can't guarantee they're going to get any one set result based on what they're purchasing. It's all those rules. It's all those things that are like, Hey, this is what you need to know before you buy from me. Like I said, it's another way to limit your liability because you're not perfect. Neither is your site, neither your products. Sometimes products of website will go down, and that happens, and you're not going to lose money because you didn't say that that might happen. You can't control every variable out there. You You don't want to get sued just because you didn't mention it. And then jurisdiction, like I said, you're going to decide where to throw down if any legal action does need to take place.

[00:05:09.320] - Liz Stapleton, Host
If you are based in California, you don't want to go to Massachusetts. That's a long way to have to deal with that. So just keeping in mind, you get to choose that. It's your site, your rules. All right, so that's the basics of terms and conditions. If you're going to be selling digital products, you absolutely need them. If you're going to be selling physical products, same thing. But digital products, I feel like it can sometimes be overlooked, and it's something you shouldn't. Intellectual Property. Now, this is a very specialized area of law, and I am not specialized in that area. So if you decide to register a copyright or a trademark, I would suggest you need to go find an attorney that specializes in this area. You don't want a real estate attorney filing a trademark. It is such a specialized area of law. I'm going to talk about why in just a sec. So trademarks protect a brand's reputation and informs a customer what they're going to get. You know When you see the Nike swoosh, you're going to get a pretty solid shoe, might run a little narrow. But if you saw a Nike swoosh on a shoe that fell apart in a week, you'd be really confused.

[00:06:11.350] - Liz Stapleton, Host
A swoosh is a trademark, but there's also, I think, text marks. There's lots of different kinds of marks. If you think there's Dove Chocolate and Dove Soap, they're both Dove. But because they're such different products, there isn't any possibility of confusion. You're not going to confuse Dove Chocolate for Dove Soap. They can both be trademarked because different categories. This is why you really need to work with someone who specializes in trademarks if you want to file a trademark. Don't just ask your buddy that is a lawyer if they can do it for you. They really shouldn't agree to do it, but don't have them do it anyway. Because the whole categorization process, like I said, is very specialized, it's very tedious. And in order to successfully get your mark, you need to make sure you're doing it in the right category. If someone else doesn't already have that trademark, all that jazz. So just keep that in mind. It's not just the name, it's a category that matters, which is why you need to work with a trademark attorney if you're going to want to register one. But you might not register, so we'll get to that in a second.

[00:07:09.000] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Next up, copyright. The purpose of copyright is to protect what you've created from being stolen. If you created something, it's yours. If you wrote an article, someone can't just take it and paste it on their site because it's copyright-protected because you wrote it. Make sure on the flip side, you are being respectful of other people's copyright. If you're doing a roundup post or something, you can't just take someone's image and because you link to them, put it in your site. Attribution is not the same thing as permission. So if you are stealing someone's image, you're stealing someone's image, you're violating their copyright, don't do it. That being said, you don't have to register to claim copyright or trademark. It applies automatically. Trademark, you do have to be the first one with that mark. But you don't necessarily have to register. So you can use the trademark, you can use the copyright symbol. You You don't use the R symbol because that shows it's registered. There are some benefits to it being registered, one of the things is statutory damages. You don't necessarily have to prove that it hindered your business. You can I'm not going to say they stole it.

[00:08:15.840] - Liz Stapleton, Host
It was mine. Pay me money. It's a little more complicated than that. You do have to go to court. But one of the benefits of registering your copyright or your trademark is statutory damages. On the flip side, if you're not sure if you can use something, ask permission. Make sure you get it in writing so that you can reference it later if you need to. So that's all well and good. Stuff you create is yours to copyright. What about AI? So there's this case that took place in the US district Court of DC. And basically, It really stood on the ground of human authorship is a bedrock requirement for copyright. So what happened is this person made an AI tool in a generator and then tried to copyright the image his tool created and he lost. So here's where it stands. Whether the work is basically one of human authorship with the computer or AI, merely being an assisting instrument, or whether the traditional elements of authorship in the work were actually conceived and executed not by the man, but by the machine. Are you using AI as an assistant or is AI doing all the work and you're just then slapping it up there?

[00:09:25.760] - Liz Stapleton, Host
That's the difference. We're going to talk about a couple of examples. For example, if you give AI some keywords and ask it to write a blog post, if you take the content produced by the AI and publish the blog post, it's not going to be copyright protected because the computer wrote it, not you. Which means anyone could then copy it and put it on their site. And there's not a whole lot you could do because it's not copyright protected. You didn't create it. It doesn't have human authorship. It doesn't mean you can't use AI to help you write blog posts. It just means that you can't only use AI. You need to think of AI as an assistant if you want to be able to claim copyright. For example, I use AI on some of my sites to help spit out a super, duper rough draft. My goal is really to get words on a page so that I'm avoiding blank page syndrome. But then I go through multiple rounds of edits and formatting before I get to the final draft. In that example, a lot of the final content is of my own making.

[00:10:24.920] - Liz Stapleton, Host
I'm using AI as an assistant, so it should qualify for copyright protection. Images, things get a little messier. Again, there's the question of human authorship. Personally, I would not touch an image generator with a 10-foot pole. The reason being, and this is really, guys, my interpretation, this is my thoughts, is I think artists are going to have a much easier time proving infringement by the AI companies and using their artwork to train on. I've literally seen AI-generated images is that you can see a warped artist signature in the image. Machines can't pick up a paint brush. They can do ones and zeros in text. They can't pick up a paint brush. I think artists are going to have a much easier time proving infringement. That will mean that the future of AI image creation, this could be years and years down the road, but it's still not something I really want to mess with. Personally, I think the future of AI image creation is going to involve licensing deals. But my concern is if an AI company is found to have infringed on a visual artist's copyright, what does that mean for the image you created?

[00:11:35.330] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Will you be required to remove it? Are you going to be required to pay fee? We just don't know. That being said, that's where you're putting in a prompt and asking AI image generator to spit out an image. I would not do that. That's my personal preference. Maybe you're more comfortable with that. I think there's a lot more potential issues, especially with copyright. Of course, that image that it pops out is not going to be copyright protected. I think there's a lot more potential issues there. That being said, I think there's a lot of great AI editing tools for graphics that you own or have licensed to be able to remove a background or do things like that using AI in that way and assisting with the image that you own or have the proper license to use, I think it's fine. I think that's, again, falling into that being an assistant versus actually authoring the work. Okay, now let's get to this, Which has been in the headlines towards the end of... Like I said, I'm recording this at the end of 2024, but we're in January 2025 at the time we were watching this.

[00:12:39.430] - Liz Stapleton, Host
This is a potential new FTC rule on recurring subscriptions. It should go into effect December, I think, 16th, or at least part of it, and then the rest should go to effect in April of 2025. That being said, there may be some legal challenges to it. There's a new administration, who knows if that will impact it at all. I'm going to go over this based on what the text of the final rule submitted to the federal register is, because I obviously can't see into the future to see what's going to happen between now and when you're watching this. Of course, I'm in the comments below. If there has been a big update, I'll be sure to, or if there's a big difference in what I'm presenting to what you guys are watching at the time, I will comment below. But let's go ahead and talk about it. What is the new rule? It's the Federal Trade Commission's Negative Option Rule. It's designed to ensure consumers understand what they are purchasing and allow them to cancel, type it there, but that's okay, their participation without undue burden. Negative options, which I feel like is a really strange term, is probably a little hard to understand.

[00:13:51.740] - Liz Stapleton, Host
To provide you some context, what this applies to are four different kinds of what they call negative option features. One is prenotification plans, which I really don't think applies to the online business space. But what it is, is when sellers provide notice offering goods, and then send and charge for those goods, only if the consumer doesn't take action. So if they're like, No, I don't want that, they won't get They're going to get charged. But otherwise, if they don't say anything, they didn't pay attention, they're going to get charged. So it doesn't really apply, I think, in this space. Another is continuity plans. So that's where a consumer agrees in advance to receive periodic shipments, which they continue to receive until they cancel. That could be something like FabFitFun comes to mind, like subscription boxes and things like that. That could also be potentially a membership. It just depends. A membership would actually qualify really well. An automatic renewal is the third one. So it's automatically renew consumer subscription when they expire unless consumers affirmatively cancel the subscription. So the way I... So again, that could be a membership. But if you, for example, they've signed up for 12 months of the membership, but it's a split pay.

[00:15:06.080] - Liz Stapleton, Host
They signed up for 12 months and they make monthly payments on it to pay that 12 months, and then it automatically renews for another 12 months. That would be an automatic renewal versus a continuity plan where it's just like you sign up for the monthly plan and it renews until you cancel, or you sign up for the annual plan and it renews annually until you cancel. It's just a little bit different. Then the final one which also you could see with trials, if you're doing like, lower cost trials or free trials, is the free to pay plan. So this is the fourth type of negative option feature, which is, again, weird language, but that's just how it's got. It's been renamed Recurring Subscriptions for the Rule. But basically, it's when a consumer receives goods for free for a trial period, after the trial, the seller automatically begins charging a fee unless consumers affirmably cancel. So like I said, examples of memberships. Other ones could be upsells, where you're using the previously given information to charge for one thing to charge for another. You have to make sure they clearly understand that additional upsell or bundled offers.

[00:16:11.310] - Liz Stapleton, Host
So what is required? This rule has gotten a lot of attention for it's like, Click to cancel aspect, but there's actually another part of it that is the clear and conspicuous disclosure and express informed consent. You need unambiguous affirmative to the negative option rule feature. In practice, what I think this is going to end up looking like is a checkmark required at checkout. So similar to how you have a check, I have to agree to the terms and conditions in order to buy, I think it's going to be a second checkmark where it be something like, you are agreeing to be charged X amount of dollars monthly until you take action to cancel the subscription before your next bill charge date. You may easily cancel the subscription by visiting, put the web page or whatever. So having an addition, so they'd have to check both of those in order to check out. That could be clear, unambiguous, unambiguous, affirmative consent to that, making sure they understand. There we go. So the next swing is the click to cancel. And what does that mean? So basically, and this is probably the most well-known part of this rule, is it has to be as easy to cancel as it was to sign up.

[00:17:27.980] - Liz Stapleton, Host
So the seller must provide a way to cancel through the medium the consumer used to consent. If they didn't have to talk to a chatbot in order to cancel, in order to sign up, they shouldn't have to talk to a chatbot in order to cancel. If they didn't sign up by sending an email, they shouldn't have to send an email to cancel. The cancelation mechanism must be easy to find when the consumer seeks to cancel, it's another bit. So that might mean putting it in your terms and conditions. Here's the link of how to cancel or whatever the case may be, or putting it in the footer of your website. So in practice, that might be what it looks like. So for example, I use Thrivecart. And so Thrivecart does have a customer hub that customers can access in order to manage their subscriptions. And I do utilize that feature. So that would work. Another one could be If they submit a form and then you have it all on your back-end, then it automatically will then cancel based on that form submission. It's got to be just as easy. And if they are able to automatically sign up, they shouldn't have to submit a form and wait for a manual approval cancel, especially if they might be charged again, depending on how quickly that happens.

[00:18:36.120] - Liz Stapleton, Host
You could put in your terms that you need to cancel within two or three business days. There's some room and flexibility there. But keep in mind, basically, it's got to be as easy to cancel as it was to sign up. All righty, so let's go ahead and review what we talked about in this session. We talked about what terms and conditions are, and hopefully you now know if you need them, why you don't necessarily have to file for copyright trademark, but again, that there are benefits to doing so. We also talked about the new FTC Recurring Subscription Rules, and what they mean in practice. We also talked about the importance of AI disclosures, and we didn't actually touch on BOI, but if you go back to the intermediate session, I cover that there. Basically, if you're a registered business in the US, then you need to file a BOI report with federal government. It's free. It takes 5, 10 minutes. Definitely go check out that session to learn more. Let's go ahead and talk about putting it all into action. You're likely going to want to include three pages on your site. You should have your privacy policy.

[00:19:33.530] - Liz Stapleton, Host
You should have your terms and conditions, especially if you're selling digital products, and a disclaimers page. So double-check, make sure that your policy pages have these things on there. And this checklist, I'll include a link below so that you're not… I mean, you can screenshot as well, whatever works for you. The default WordPress privacy policy does include some of these, but not all. So if you are working off of that, you probably want to upgrade. Terms and conditions page, this is what you should include. Again, I'll link to a checklist below. There's no default in WordPress for terms and conditions, but some digital product checkout softwares do include some. You might look at that as a starting point. Don't ever just copy and paste someone else's terms and conditions because that could be copyright infringement. It could also be not right for you. Some disclosures and disclaimers. You may need to include testimonials. Disclaimers are especially important if you're selling digital products and using testimonials. You can't I guarantee they're going to get the same results as those in the testimonial. So make sure you include that disclaimer. And again, there's no default. So first of all, I'm going to say that if you can afford it, the best option is always going to be to hire an attorney.

[00:20:45.940] - Liz Stapleton, Host
And I'm saying that I'm not someone who offers these services. So I'm not like, Hire me. I'm not. That is always going to be your best option. If you aren't at the point where you can afford that, it's just too cost prohibitive, understandable, attorneys aren't cheap. Then the next best option is going to be to buy legal templates from an attorney that understands online business and blogging world. I, of course, am one. There's a lot of us, though. When I started, there weren't, but there are a lot out there. You might have some templates from various bundles and things that you can work together. Who knows? Alternatively, you can buy some. I sell some. This isn't a big old pitch for mine because I was very strict with what pitching is allowed in my summit sessions, and I'm going to abide by the same rules I put my speakers to. So I will say that I do love my templates. It's the Website Legal Templates Bundle is my most comprehensive bundle. I have a smaller bundle. If you are newer, called the Blogger Essentials Legal Templates Bundle, They both come with generators. I think they're great.

[00:21:46.860] - Liz Stapleton, Host
They're awesome. Other people think they're great. They're awesome. I'm not going to read through all these. I'm just going to scroll quickly. And then just as a thank you for watching, I have a free gift for you called the Smart Bloggers Guide to the Legal Side of Blogging. So it goes over the stuff we talked about in here, as well as stuff I covered in the other sessions. And it's just a great reference guide because as an online business owner, you're wearing about 27 different hats. And it wouldn't surprise me if not all of this is immediately absorbed and remembered forever. I would understand it not being. So being able to access this reference, this guidebook, if you will, is a great way to go back and be like, wait a second, do I need to do something about this? So to redeem your free access, which you can do any point this week while the summit is live, go to elizabethstapleton.com/go/2025. I normally charge about $30 bucks for this thing, so I'm giving away for free this week, and hopefully you enjoyed it, and you got something out of this session. If you guys have questions, I am in the comments below, and this link is also below.

[00:22:51.810] - Liz Stapleton, Host
But that's all I have for you today. Like I said, short, sweet, to the point. I'll see you guys in the chat. I'll see you guys around the summit. I you are enjoying it and you enjoy the sessions. And have a great rest of your day.

[00:00:09.330] - Lucrezia Iapichino, bloggingfornewbloggers.com
Hello everyone and welcome. I'm thrilled to be at the Blogger Breakthrough Summit, this is o ne of the best blocking events every year. So when Liz invited me, I was so excited. And so welcome to my session. I'm Lacrezia And today I'm going to be sharing some information and actionable tips on how to be GDPR compliant. But before we dive in, let me show a little bit about my background. So you might be more about my expertise and knowledge about this topic. Let me briefly introduce myself.

[00:00:36.770] - Lucrezia
As I said, my name is Lucrezia. I'm an international lawyer, university lecturer and GDPR expert. In addition to my qualification as a lawyer and mission to the bar, I also hold the master's for international lawyers and PhD in law with a major in European Union law.

[00:00:52.820] - Lucrezia
Mossel, the co-founder, together with my sister Marina, Blogging for New Blogger AnthonyLovebug.com. The The Blogging for New Bloggers community of over 30,000 members. I use the combination of my research, teaching and blogging experience plus over 15 years legal expertise to empower other bloggers and online entrepreneurs to run a successful blog on compliance with legal requirements.

[00:01:18.140] - Lucrezia
As a blogger myself, I make over twenty thousand dollars every single month with my blog. If you've been blogging for a while, you may know what is one of the most powerful marketing tools any blogger may ever have. And even if you are very new to blogging, if you just starting out, you might have heard of this common expression. ""The money is in the list"". And it's actually true. The real magic happens with my email list, a very big chunk of my monthly income from my block house to my email list. And if you want to make money blogging, you must focus on your email list. But and there is a but you might have heard another expression. The law is the law. So, you building your email list should be your number one priority. At the same time, you need to make sure you meet all legal requirements. And regulation you want to focus your attention on the most is the GDPR.

[00:02:19.280] - Lucrezia
The GDPR may apply to many bloggers no matter where they are based.

[00:02:24.620] - Lucrezia
Now, another top reason is because the GDPR sets a very high standard of compliance and privacy protection, which means that if you are GDPR compliant, you basically comply with other regulations and legal requirements as well.

[00:02:41.630] - Lucrezia
Plus the GDPR as initiated a chain reaction. So comply with the GDPR now will kick start your compliance with other upcoming privacy regulation or other regulations such as the CCPA that have a high traffic threshold.

[00:02:57.650] - Lucrezia
So, how can I help you today? Today I will walk you through a few steps you can take to grow your list in a way that is GDPR compliant. But I will go through a lot of information, so get ready to take some notes, feel free to ask me questions, or come back to this session later on to go at your own pace. But make sure you stay till the end, because I have some gifts for you, including my copyright notice to protect your content, your blog posts, e-books, of course, is freebies or any other type of content and resources that you create.

[00:03:31.700] - Lucrezia
Let's have a look at what we will cover today. Okay, first of all, we'll see what the GDPR is and whether it may actually apply to you. Once we got this down, then we're going to see why you need to comply with it. And we will also cover what happens if you don't comply with the GDPR. And finally, the third thing we're going to work on is your GDPR compliance. I want you to leave this session having learned something new that you can implement right away.

[00:03:50.120] - Lucrezia
I will share a few actionable tips for you to grow your email list in compliance with the GDPR. Let's go ahead and get started. But before we dive in, please take a moment to read my legal disclaimer, because although I'm a lawyer by profession, I'm not your lawyer. And so this session does not constitute legal advice, but the information I will share is for educational purposes only.

[00:04:27.830] - Lucrezia
All right. Like I said, the first thing we will see today is what the GDPR is and why you may be required to comply with the GDPR.

[00:04:35.570] - Lucrezia
GDPR stands for General Data Protection Regulation, and it's a regulation of the European Union, which was especially designed to reinforce the rights to privacy and protect personal data of use based in the European Union. In simple words, the purpose of this regulation is to set the rules for individuals, agencies and companies, including blogs on how to collect, store and process personal data of individuals who are based in the European Union.

[00:05:04.820] - Lucrezia
So, basically the GDPR covers anything to do with the processing of personal data. I know, you may be thinking that this has nothing to do with you because I see this often with bloggers, and especially with new bloggers. They think that they don't need to comply with the GDPR, they all say the same. They think they don't process any personal information. But that's not true. This is because personal data is a broad definition. It can be anything that can be used to identify an individual.

[00:05:34.570] - Lucrezia
So, what's the first thing that comes to mind? Name an email address right for your email list. But it's not only that, it's also the login address- sorry the login details I meant, their location data, the IP address, the cookies and so on.

[00:05:51.820] - Lucrezia
And so even if you think you're not processing any data, if you have a blog, then you're most likely to process personal data on a regular basis. There are so many activities or tasks performed on your blog every day that involve data processing. Just to give you a few examples, contact forms and your contact page you may use form requesting a name and an email address, comment systems. In order for your users to comment on your blog, your comment system or plug in probably required them to leave the email address and other information such as name and the link to their website.

[00:06:31.750] - Lucrezia
Google Analytics, they track information relating to your users, including their location, type of operating system, browser type direction, duration of stay, time of discertation etcetera.

[00:06:43.360] - Lucrezia
Then we have, cookies, cookies stored on your website, all the data that you collect about your visitors using cookies installed on their devices or they login into membership areas or affiliate dashboards and so much more.

[00:06:58.780] - Lucrezia
The other misconception is that being the GDPR regulation of the European Union, many bloggers think it only applies to blog space in the European Union.

[00:07:09.040] - Lucrezia
Let's clarify this. Let's take a closer look at the territorial application of the GDPR of the GDPR applies to blocs based in European Union.

[00:07:19.780] - Lucrezia
But what if you're based in the US or Australia or Canada, South Africa or India or anywhere else? The GDPR clearly states that ""If you are offering goods or services to individuals in the European Union, even if payment is not required"". And I will repeat this because many bloggers think that if you're not making money with your blog, you're not required to comply with the GDPR. I want to make sure that we're clear on this. Even if you don't receive any payment, the GDPR may still apply to you. I was saying that the GDPR clearly states that if you are offering goods or services to individuals in the European Union, even if payment is not required or if you monitor their behavior, then the GDPR applies to you. And it doesn't matter whether you're based in the European Union or somewhere else. That means that first of all, even if you're not based in the European Union, the GDPR may still apply to you. It means that the GDPR may apply to you even if you're not generating any income from your blog yet. But it also means that if you're not based in the European Union, the GDPR only applies to you if you either target users based in the European Union or you monitor their behavior.

[00:08:42.520] - Lucrezia
Targeting users based in the European Union means that you actively and expressly want to offer goods or services to them. So, for example, if you offer the possibility to buy your products in Europe or you have your checkout page in German, or you actually mentioned customers or users were in the European Union, then the GDPR applies to you because you made the parent that you want to offer goods or services to users based in the European Union.

[00:09:11.740] - Lucrezia
As to the monitoring of the behavior of users based in the European Union, you actually need to track their behavior through profiling techniques with the aim to make a decision on the basis of their preference or behaviors. Let's say, for example, if you just use Google Analytics, that will make you in itself automatically bound to comply with the GDPR. But if you're running ads with behavioral targeting techniques then the GDPR may apply to you, even if you're not based in the European Union, at the same time, you need to be aware that if you have visitors from the European Union and you use behavioral ads or plugins pixels or widgets, such as, for example, the Facebook pixel, which is quite common to have, then you may be bound by the GDPR. If you have an email list and use progressive profile. Or you tag or segment your place in order to believe that your subscribers emails that are more relevant to them you have subscribers based in the European Union, then you may be bound by the GDPR.

[00:10:21.550] - Lucrezia
Let's see why you should comply and what you may risk if you don't. GDPR compliance comes with several benefits. There are many reasons why you might want to comply with the GDPR. And that's not only because the GDPR is the law. And so basically you're legally required to do so. They need to comply usually comes down to three most common scenarios. Number one, you are based in the European Union and so you are required by law to comply with the GDPR. Number two you're based outside of the European Union. But you target individuals based in the European Union or you monitor their behavior. And so you are still required by law to comply with the GDPR.

[00:11:09.940] - Lucrezia
Number three, you want to comply with the GDPR, even though you are not required by law. And I know the third scenario sounds crazy, right? But it's actually more common than you may think. There are several reasons why you may want to work on your GDPR compliance, because it comes with several benefits for you. All right. Let's go through the top reason to comply with the GDPR one by one. First of all, as we pointed out several times, the GDPR is a legally binding regulation.

[00:11:45.370] - Lucrezia
What happens if you don't comply with the GDPR? Well, first of all, you can get fined and the fines are quite steep. They can be up to 20 million euros. And if you're thinking that they will never go after small blogs and that's not true, you might not get a fine in the millions, but even a few thousand dollars may set you back. Plus, the GDPR provides users with the ability to lodge a formal complaint against you. They have the right to do so with the relevant supervisory authority. And let's not forget that you can get sued by your users no matter if you are on the right side lawsuits are always time consuming, stressful, costly, and they also distract you from your primary goals.

[00:12:34.810] - Lucrezia
Well, the last thing you want is for a lawsuit to be brought against you for something that you can correct in a matter of minutes. This can harm your reputation and compromise the relationship you've built with your audience. Also, companies may not want to work with you. Your earning potential would be affected. Or if you were already working with brands or other networks or you were accepted into affiliate programs they might terminate your contract. This may lead to loss of earnings and your overall blog revenue may be affected. Let me give you an example. He was a Bluehost affiliate agreement requiring you to comply with the GDPR.

[00:13:13.780] - Lucrezia
Now another important reason you why may want to be GDPR compliant is because it builds trust with your audience that complying with the GDPR shows your readers that you care about them and that you're transparent. You want them to feel respected and appreciated. And now, because of the GDPR in itself, users are more educated about their rights and the protection of their privacy. If you don't comply with the GDPR, they will notice and you will lose their trust. If your readers don't trust you, they won't convert into paying customers. To be able to make sales your blog needs to look legitimate and lawful.

[00:13:55.490] - Lucrezia
And this brings us to our last top reasons. Complying with the GDPR will make your block look more professional. So making your blood GDPR compliant will kickstart your compliance with either existing or upcoming privacy regulations as well. So, for example, it will kickstart your compliance with the CCPA, which has a higher traffic threshold. So once your blog grows and you will be required to work on your CCPA compliance, most of it will be already done. There are so many benefits in complying with the GDPR.

[00:14:29.830] - Lucrezia
So, let's see what you can do today to make sure that you are GDPR compliant and you got your email list in compliance with the GDPR. I want you to be able to take a few steps towards your GDPR compliance as soon as you finish this session.

[00:14:46.540] - Lucrezia
So, I will share a few actionable tips and a couple of things you can implement straight away. So first of all, what do you think makes an email list GDPR compliant? How would you feel if you were added by someone to the email list without your consent? Because you have to remember that the GDPR is. To protect you and for you to protect the privacy rights abuses, so the first thing is you need to obtain your user's consent before adding them to your email list. I will give you a few options to do that in a way that is absolutely under percent GDPR compliance. But please bear with me for a second while I go through a couple of concepts about consent requirements from your users under the GDPR or in through this consent requirements and understanding how things work under the GDPR will make it so much easier to implement my actionable tips.

[00:15:52.830] - Lucrezia
So, let's see what the GDPR says about consent. But please keep in mind that consent is not the only lawful ground to process. Best forgotten that the GDPR is the most common. And as a blogger, you most likely to use consent as the lawful basis as your data processing. And so that's why we will focus on that. All right. So the key elements of consent under the GDPR that they must be given freely. You can't force people to give consent. It must be unambiguous that these language that you use is easy to understand. And it's clear. It must be informed, which means your users should be given the reason for processing information and how you're going to do that and what you will do with the information and so on. It must be specific. You should get consent using an affirmative action. That's clear. It must be granular; this means that you can not bundle separate matters. So, if you process the data for different purposes, you need to obtain separate consent for each matter. It can be withdrawn at any time and it should be easy to do so. It should be as easy to withdraw as to give consent. Plus, parental consent is needed if your users are age 16 or younger. In some countries, the minimum age of consent can be lowered, but never below 30.

[00:17:26.500] - Lucrezia
Okay, now let's see what this means for bloggers. How all these legalese translates into what you need to do to grow your email list in a way that is GDPR offline. First of all, I have a question for you. What's the main way you collect personal information to add people to your email list? It is sign up forms? You can have them on your landing pages for your late magnet's. You can have them embedded in your blog post for content upgrades. Or you can have general subscribed forums for your readers to join your newsletters in different places on your blog. Right. These are just a few examples, but sign-off forms are the most common way to add people to your list. And so we need to make sure that they are GDPR compliant. For your forms to be GDPR compliant. You need to make sure that they come with a link to your privacy policy. And this is because the GDPR mandates that you provide users with detailed information at the time of obtaining consent or processing data.

[00:18:34.890] - Lucrezia
The information you need to give includes; how you plan to store, process or share their personal data. The application you must uphold their rights under the GDPR and much more. Obviously, if you have to do that every time you want to collect some personal information, it will be a bit too much. The good thing is you can direct you users to your privacy policy. So, you detail all this info in your policy. You do it once and then you link to your privacy policy wherever and whenever you process personal information. And I will also recommend to our new privacy policy in your [inaudible] so that it's easily accessible from everywhere on your blog.

[00:19:16.200] - Lucrezia
So, now the bigger question becomes, is your privacy policy up to scratch when it comes to the GDPR? Does it follow GDPR provisions? Does it make all the GDPR requirements? If not, then you will have to update it to make it GDPR compliant. Or if you don't have a privacy policy at all, then you need to create one as soon as possible. So, the first step you will have to take is to either create or update your privacy policy to make a GDPR compliant. If you don't know how to do that, I offer a plug and play GDPR compliant privacy policy template and I'm pretty sure Liz has one too.

[00:19:54.510] - Lucrezia
Then the next thing you need to ensure is that you don't request more information than what is needed. For example, for your email name and email address will be sufficient. You shouldn't be asking for the postal address, for example, unless you need to send them a physical item today, home address. Okay. You also need to obtain, as we say, separate consent for each matter. And you can achieve that by either using checkboxes within the form or GDPR option for users from the European Union.

[00:20:35.340] - Lucrezia
And because we saw consent must be expressed through affirmative action check boxes or GDPR options cannot be pre checked.

[00:20:45.900] - Lucrezia
Is this all starting to click for you or shall we take a look at a few examples?

[00:20:53.670] - Lucrezia
All right, let's have a look at this form. This is a form to join a newsletter, and this form is GDPR compliant. It has a link to your privacy policy and it's a clickable link, so people can find out how you collect process and store personal information before they give you their personal details. The exact time box for your privacy policy sound check, which is good. It also informs users that they can unsubscribe at any time and only asks for name and email address, no phone number or other info that are not necessary.

[00:21:32.070] - Lucrezia
So, this form is great. This is is in compliance with the GDPR. But this example was pretty straightforward. Things can get a bit more complicated when you offer a freebie to entice you users to join your email list. And this is because when you have a form requesting an email address in exchange for your freebie, you are only obtaining consent from your users to process the personal data to send them the freebie. By entering the email address, your users are not automatically giving you consent to being added to your email list, and therefore you cannot add them. If you also want to add them to your email list, you need to request separate consent for this purpose because, as we said earlier, consent until the GDPR needs to be granular. You need to obtain consent for each individual matter. You can request separate consent for different purposes in the same form as long as each consent request is distinguishable from one another. But you can't not bundle them. And I know this sounds terrible because that's- that's why you offered the freebie in the first place. You offered a freebie to entice people to join your email list. Right. That's why freebies are also called lead Magnet's Right.

[00:22:57.720] - Lucrezia
So, I know it's discouraging, but don't worry. You need to keep in mind that one, this only applies to people based in the European Union. You don't have to extend the same rights to those from other countries unless, of course, you want to, which is- which is a good idea if you want to.

[00:23:15.810] - Lucrezia
And then number two, this all applies if you use your consent as your legal basis and not, for example, legitimate interest or other legal basis under the GDPR. But I don't want to confuse you and overwhelm with my information.

[00:23:30.480] - Lucrezia
So, let's see what the practical implication of all of this and how you can obtain consent for different matters separately. You can achieve that in two different ways. Option number one, you can use separate check checkboxes. You can create a form like this one for your freebie and you then add a separate check box to obtain consent from you. Use this to add them to your email list and send them marketing emails.

[00:24:02.070] - Lucrezia
Now, you see, in this form, my freebie is my free five day email, blogging classes, blogging for you about this fast track. But you can do that the same thing with a free checklist, report, a guide printable, eBook or whatever you wish to offer as a freebie. So you make a form for your freebie and then within the form you are the checkbox for your marketing email. As we know, you can have the check box project or a system where if users don't check the box for your marketing email, they can continue. This means that if they don't check the check box for your marketing emails, you will need to send them your freebie, but you won't be able to add them to your email list. So, this first option is pretty easy to implement, but it comes with the huge downside that you would reduce your chances of growing your email list by offering the same choices to all users, including those who are based outside of the European Union. And therefore, not covered by the GDPR. You will basically reduce your chances to grow your email list when there's no actual need to do so, since the law doesn't require you to apply the GDPR provisions to users who are not based in the European Union.

[00:25:23.570] - Lucrezia
So the pros are that this option can be implemented easily. And you will also have a very engaged email list of people who really want to be there and receive your marketing email, so they will likely buy from you. The cons is that it will take you much longer to grow your email list.

[00:25:43.550] - Lucrezia
Option number two, you can show a separate page to users from the European Union. This is currently my favorite way to request separate consent. I do so by using a GDPR fee income bracket so it will determine whether your users are based in the European Union or not, but the IP address, and then it will treat them differently. If your users are based in the European Union, [inaudible 00:26:10]  will show them this page after they have subscribed to your form to redeem your freebie. So, with this option, you won't have to change anything directly within your forms.

[00:25:23.570] - Lucrezia
Everything happens after your users sign up. Of course, if they don't check the check box consenting to receiving your marketing emails, you won't be able to add them to your email list. But in this scenario, this will only apply to your users based in the European Union. Your other users won't even ever see this form of planning concern for your marketing emails. And you can add them to your email list because the GDPR doesn't apply to them.

[00:26:52.010] - Lucrezia
So, this option will allow you to grow. Your email is much faster. The downside is that people may think you are not GDPR compliant, since the GDPR form will only show two users based space the European Union. And that's why, whenever possible, I mentioned on my blog that things may feel differently depending on where my users are based. I also add the link to this page in the first email that I sent them saying, ""If you're from the European Union, please complete GDPR options so that one, if [inaudible 00:27:25], couldn't get the IP address or something. I can still make sure I meet GDPR requirements and two everyone will see I'm GDPR compliant and they can exercise their rights.

[00:27:39.170] - Lucrezia
I have [inaudible 00:27:39]  for this feature. But I hope you can replicate this with other email providers of plugins.

[00:27:45.110] - Lucrezia
Before we finish just a few words on double opt-in because there's this myth that it's a requirement that the GDPR as soon as people hear the word GDPR, they say, ""Oh yes, you need the double opt-in. No, that's actually not true. The GDPR does not require double opt-in per say for your data processing to be lawful. But double opt-in is a great way to keep proof of consent.

[00:28:11.360] - Lucrezia
The GDPR that's required that you document are you obtained consent. So, switching double opt-in on is great because it will allow you to store proof that you use it has actually giving you consent. It's also great because this way all of your subscribers will be confirmed, which makes for a super engaged list and email list that is more likely to open your emails and buy from you. If you have a large list, you know how expensive it can be to pay for your email service providers. So, [inaudible 00:28:48] is quite expensive. One of the most expensive, probably. So there's no point in paying so much for subscribers who won't open your emails? Plus, as there is this very common misconception that double opt-in is a GDPR requirement, enabling it will automatically make you look more legitimate.

[00:29:08.690] - Lucrezia
All right. These are actionable steps that can implement right away that actionable steps that you can take right now to start working towards your GDPR compliance.

[00:29:20.210] - Lucrezia
So, let's recap what you can do today.

[00:29:24.290] - Lucrezia
Step number one, create a GDPR privacy policy that is compliant with all GDPR requirements or update your privacy policy to make it GDPR compliant.

[00:29:34.430] - Lucrezia
Step number two add the link to your privacy policy in your footer so that it is easily accessible everywhere on your blog and then add the link to your privacy policy from all your sign up forms and everywhere else where you collect personal data.

[00:29:50.300] - Lucrezia
Step number three, if you offer a freebie add checkboxes for your marketing emails or a newsletter or a show a separate content page to your users based in the European Union to join your email list or newsletter.

[00:30:05.930] - Lucrezia
Unfortunately, we were limited in time for this session. We couldn't really tackle everything. I know we went through a lot of information, but the GDPR has introduced so many new obligations. So you need to make sure that everything your forms, your plans, your policies are GDPR compliant. For example, you know the unsubscribe link that you must have in all of the emails you send that's not enough on the GDPR. I know, shocking, right. In fact users based in the European Union also have the right to be forgotten. And you need to make sure you have policies and systems in place to allow for them to exercise this right. Now this is just an example, but there is so much more. If you want to learn more, if you want to have the peace of mind. Your blog is fully of GDPR complain that you protecting yourself and your blog illegally, that you won't risk fines, lawsuits or formal complaints at all. Or if you're not sure how to write a GDPR compliant privacy policy and you don't have the time to figure it out on your own time that you'd rather spend doing what you do best, just go on your blog and working on your design of genius.

[00:31:26.380] - Lucrezia
So if you want to get rid of all the guesswork and headache and you're after something that is done for you and ready to go, something that makes sure you meet all GDPR requirements, kickstart your compliance with similar existing or upcoming private regulations, and keep you up to date with future changes in legislation, then I have something perfect for you. Here you have it. My GDPR Compliant Blog classes which covered everything you need to know and to make your blog GDPR compliant. And come with a Step-By-Step action plan with detailed instructions on how to do things.

[00:32:09.730] - Lucrezia
But each lesson has been kept short and to the point. In fact, each lesson is designed to be super easy to implement, and each action step can be tackled in 15, 30 minutes or less. And will also be updated regularly if there are changes in legislation. And you will have lifetime access to the lessons and all its future updates at no extra costs to you. And the best part is it also comes with several amazing bonuses, including a ready to use, done for you GDPR compliant privacy policy template and GDPR compliant cookie policy template, documentation template and much more.

[00:32:54.520] - Lucrezia
Being a trained lawyer and a doctor in European Union law, this will take all the guesswork out. It's usually priced at $97, but today you can get it as part of the pro pass. So make sure you don't miss out on this special deal. On top of that, as promised, I also have some gifts for you. You can learn more about making your blog legal in my free legal class and get some legal templates that are made available for free to you if you follow this link in the slide.

**Transcript:**
[00:00:12.610] - Lucrezia
Hey, and welcome to my session on how to make money with affiliate marketing the legal way. I'm so excited to be here. This is such a fantastic summit. I've spoken at this summit a couple of years ago and it was amazing. And I'm excited to be spending the next half an hour also with you.

[00:00:30.910] - Lucrezia
So, thank you Liz, for inviting me and thank you all for being here. Now, before we start, I want to ask you a question. Do you promote affiliate products? Do you make money with affiliate marketing? Is affiliate marketing one of your different income streams or strategies?

[00:00:49.380] - Lucrezia
Why am I asking you this? Why? Because affiliate marketing is one of my absolute favorite ways of making money online and it's actually perfect for content creators, bloggers, podcasters, and YouTubers. And the beauty of being an affiliate is the ability to share with your audience, products and services that you love while earning a nice passive.

[00:01:14.650] - Lucrezia
And I emphasize the word passive income while blogging, while creating content. I emphasize the word passive because with affiliate marketing, you can earn money while sleeping, traveling on holiday, or spending time with your loved ones. We know much effort and very minimal work required. You write a blog post or a review or you make a video about it, and you get to earn money from it for years down the track. So, if you're thinking of monetizing your blog, your podcast, or social media accounts, you should definitely look into affiliate marketing.

[00:01:53.620] - Lucrezia
Now, isn't that a dream? Is it too good to be true? Is there a catch? There is no catch, but you can't just promote stuff. You need to follow certain rules.

[00:02:07.690] - Lucrezia
The law is the law. So, yeah, making money with affiliate marketing is amazing, but you need to make sure you meet all the legal requirements. There are a number of different laws that regulate affiliate marketing. In the US, you need to be complying with the Federal Trade Commission guidelines. If you don't comply, you can get fine.

[00:02:25.770] - Lucrezia
But even if you're not based in the US, if you target an international audience, I would still have all the required disclosures to be transparent with your audience and to meet the same legal standard as your audience doesn't necessarily know what laws and regulations apply or don't apply to you, so they might think you're not compliant. So, how can I help you today? Now today, I will walk you through a few steps you can take to make money through affiliate marketing in a way that is legally compliant. But I will go through a lot of information, so get ready to take some notes.

[00:03:04.990] - Lucrezia
Feel free to ask me questions or come back to this session later on to go at your own pace. But make sure you stay till the end because I have a beautiful gift for you. So, let's have a look at what we will cover today. First of all, we will see how you can make money through affiliate marketing legally. We will then see which legal requirements you need to comply with.

[00:03:30.930] - Lucrezia
Once we got this down, we're going to see what you need to include in your content to be legally compliant. And then we will go through the reasons why you must comply with the law. But we will also see how meeting these legal requirements will actually benefit you in so many ways, besides the fact that you will be legally protected. And once we establish that, I will also let you know of a resource that is perfect for you if you want to get rid of all the guesswork and edit and you ask for something that is done for you and ready to go, which is included in the all access pass. And again, I'll remind you, stay till the end because I have a really, really nice gift to share with you.

[00:04:15.910] - Lucrezia
Now, another legal stuff is not the most fun or exciting side of your business. I think Liz will agree. So, I will keep this presentation short and sweet, at least, I'll try. But before we dive in, I will quickly share a little bit about my background.

[00:04:31.530] - Lucrezia
So, for those of you who don't know me, you will learn a bit about my expertise and experience about this topic and we will get to know each other a bit better. So, let me briefly introduce myself. My name is Lucrezia. I'm originally from Italy and I've studied and worked in different countries. When I was in London, I met my husband Sam, who is [inaudible 00:04:53], and we moved together to Melbourne.

[00:04:55.900] - Lucrezia
I've worked as an international lawyer and university lecturer for over 15 years in different countries. And I'm the founder together with my sister Marina of Blogging for New Bloggers, Legal for Business Owners, and Tiny Love Bug and the Blogging for New Bloggers Community, which is a Facebook group with over 36,000 bloggers and other online entrepreneurs from all around the world. I started my business as a creative affiliate because my husband and I, we wanted a baby, but it wasn't happening for us. We tried for almost five years, so I really needed something to keep my mind off our fertility journey. And so at the time, what did I do?

[00:05:38.010] - Lucrezia
I started a blog. So I didn't start my blog as a business venture, but my blog grew more and more every month and now I make over $20,000 from my blog every single month. A big chunk of it comes from affiliate marketing. So, fast forward four years. I'm now a mom.

[00:05:58.300] - Lucrezia
I have a daughter named Violet, she's three years old. And I've used the combination of my research, legal, and business experience to help over 30,000 bloggers, podcasters, coaches, course creators, and other online entrepreneurs just like you to protect their businesses legally with my training and done for you, legal templates. So, I wanted to let you know a bit about my expertise, but at the same time, please keep in mind that I'm a lawyer by profession. I'm not your lawyer. And this presentation does not constitute legal advice.

[00:06:33.640] - Lucrezia
But the information I will be sharing today is for educational purposes only. So, please take a moment to read my legal disclaimer. All right, let's dive in. As I said, the first thing we'll see today is how you can make money with affiliate marketing the legal way. I won't spend much time explaining what affiliate marketing is, because I assume that if you hear them, you most likely know what it is.

[00:06:57.780] - Lucrezia
Or you may already been making money, lots of money, with affiliate marketing. So, there might be some other sessions in the Summit addressing affiliate marketing. So, in a nutshell, affiliate marketing is a process where you earn a commission by promoting other people's or companies' or brands' products and services if the sale is generated through your link of promotional efforts. Basically, there are three parties involved in the process, a merchant or company providing products or services, a customer buying these products or services, and an affiliate that is the middleman, promoting these products or services to potential customers and earning a commission on any sale generated through their promotion. So, you will be the middleman.

[00:07:49.920] - Lucrezia
And the beauty of it is that you don't have to create a product, you don't have to deal with customer service. You just need to recommend the product and you can make commissions. But as I said earlier, although affiliate marketing may almost sound too good to be true. Let's be clear here, it's not as easy as just putting a link within your content and collecting the cash.

[00:08:15.990] - Lucrezia
You are required by law to disclose any personal relationship, compensation, affiliation, or other conflicts of interest that you promote in your context. The Federal Trade Commission, which is basically, you know, the folks in charge of making sure people do business in a fair way, have guidelines in place that regulate affiliate marketing to ensure honesty and transparency. To comply with these guidelines, you need to be upfront and honest about any affiliation you may have with the product or company you are suggesting your audience buys from. In addition to these guidelines, affiliate programs also require the affiliates to disclose something in a specific way. So, it's important to fully read the terms of service of the affiliate program you join before you begin promoting their products.

[00:09:14.980] - Lucrezia
My mind instantly goes to the Amazon Associate program. This can be a very lucrative affiliate program for bloggers and content creators, but their disclosure requirements are very specific. If you do not comply, it's very likely you will be removed from the affiliate program, so. Okay, now I want to give you some actionable tips that you can implement straight away, so that at the end of this session, you can just go and take action to make sure that you have a legitimate disclosure statement. Because actually, that's easier said than done.

[00:09:48.730] - Lucrezia
Many things that just sent this post contain affiliate links is a sufficient disclosure, but it does not cover you legally. Your readers might not know what affiliate links are. So, because this statement is not completely clear to all readers, it does not comply with the pay or trade commission guidelines, and so it can still expose you to the risk of fine. So, let's see how to make your disclosure compliant. First of all, you should have a disclosure statement clearly and conspicuously placed at the top of any sponsored page or post containing any affiliate link.

[00:10:30.870] - Lucrezia
Now, this statement should disclose your financial relationship and compensation if it's the sponsored post, or specify what affiliate links are, and the financial rewards you may obtain through them. You will also want to link from this short statement to your disclosure page, where you should detail your full policy about affiliate links, endorsements, and sponsored posts. The disclosure must be easy to find on the page. The reader should not have to search for it. Your disclosure should also be easy to read, meaning not in a tiny pale font, your audience might not even notice.

[00:11:12.130] - Lucrezia
It should be worded in a way that your average reader will fully comprehend, and it must be located before any affiliate links appear and as close to the link as possible. It needs to be visible on every page of post where affiliate links appear. If you are promoting affiliate links on social media, you need to disclose that too. While social media platforms do have some disclosure policies built in, it's important that you don't just rely on them.

[00:11:47.910] - Lucrezia
You don't need to provide a full disclosure statement, but you do still need to let your followers or subscribers know you have something to gain from the suggestions you're making. Now, as we are limited in seeing the number of characters available on social media posts, the easiest way to discuss affiliations and sponsorship is to use hashtags. You can add affliate, hashtag affiliate link, hashtag affiliate, hashtag sponsored, hashtag ad, all right? You can also simply say this is an affiliate link. But unless your audience is the bloggers, or the creators, influencers, don't shorten the hashtags to something like, hashtag aff, which I see all the time. Other content creators may not know what them, like you know, as we understand what that means, but the average person likely does not know what that means, and you don't want to be deceptive. Alright. Let's recap the big takeaways here.

[00:12:53.950] - Lucrezia
First of all, always, always disclose. Writing an effective disclosure for your blog is essential if you want to use affiliate links. Make sure your disclosure is visible and easy to locate, but also make sure your disclosure is easy to understand. So, remember to include the following information in your disclaimers in your disclosure that you're using affiliate links on your site or within your blog post, what affiliate links are, any material relationship you have with the brands whose products you're promoting, how this would benefit you?

[00:13:29.820] - Lucrezia
For example, you get free products in return, or affiliate commissions, or a bounty on each sale you refer. You may also want to mention how you pick these products that you recommend. Do you use them yourself? Do you test them before recommending them? Explaining all of these will let you build trust with your audience.

[00:13:49.950] - Lucrezia
Include a link to your full disclosure policy page where you can go through everything in detail. Also, in your work as a content creator, as a blogger, you might want to promote products on social media as well, or you might want to start creating ebooks or courses, other resources where it would be useful, or it would make sense to recommend these products as well. Just go for it. But don't forget to add your disclosure there too. Finally, make sure you understand the terms of services of the affiliate programs you join and comply with any specific requirements they might have, or use specific disclosures when applicable.

[00:14:38.110] - Lucrezia
For example, for the Amazon associated program, and so on. All right. These are some actionable tips that you can take right away. You can implement straight away now to start working towards your compliance. And it's great that at the end of this session, you have something practical, actionable that some steps that you can take straight away. And please do it, it's really important.

[00:15:05.830] - Lucrezia
I will tell you a few reasons why you must have these disclosures in place. First of all, obviously, you want to avoid getting a fine. Legal requirements are the law, and so it's not only ethical to comply, it's not only the right thing to do. But also if you're not in compliance, you are breaking the law, which means you can expose yourself to the risk of FT fines by the Federal Trade Commission. And when you're only starting out, even a small fine for a few thousand dollars can set you back and can even you know lead to having to close your blog.

[00:15:42.860] - Lucrezia
But only you should protect your blog legally, you actually want to do so. Because protecting your blog legally comes with so many benefits. It's actually a great opportunity for your blog, for your business. So, there are several benefits in getting your legals in order. You will look legit and trustworthy.

[00:16:04.020] - Lucrezia
You will be accepted into affiliate programs. If you don't have these disclosures in place, you won't be accepted. Most terms of services require that you have disclosures and if you don't, they can kick you out from their affiliate program at any time, so they might not accept you to start with, or even if you're accepted, they might kick you out later on if they find out. You will be seen as established, professional and credible. You will build trust with your audience and convert them into repeat customers.

[00:16:31.380] - Lucrezia
When you are transparent with your audience, when you build trust with them, they will buy from you. People buy from people they trust. You will also be taken seriously by your followers, clients, or potential partnerships and joint ventures, you will run well on Google and another search engine, which is really important to drive traffic to your content. So, you will get peace of mind of being legally protected.

[00:16:58.170] - Lucrezia
You will look legitimate, professional, and it will save you money. It will save you time, save you money, and will open up more opportunity to make more money. Now, just a couple of words on when or where to get your legals in order. Okay, the best thing, the best time to get on top of your legal stuff was yesterday as it's better to have all this stuff set up before you start your blog, before you start writing content or publishing blog posts.

[00:17:29.890] - Lucrezia
But if you haven't done it yet, then the second best time is now. And where to get them? Okay, first of all, stay clear from free legal stuff and like free generators and things like that, they're not complete, they're too generic, they're definitely not comprehensive, and they don't meet all the legal requirements. You won't even know what draft is free template in the first place, so don't rely on those. Another thing you should never do it is copying legal pages and documents from other people's websites. Don't do that.

[00:18:05.590] - Lucrezia
Don't. Just don't. That's copyright infringement. Yes, it applies to legal stuff too. Plus, you don't know what legislation applies to them specifically and whether it is the same that applies to you too.

[00:18:20.110] - Lucrezia
So, it's very risky to rely on those. Not only that, every site offers different services, products, and advice. You need to make sure your policies reflect your site, your location, and its specific needs. So, the best option would be to hire a lawyer, but I understand that this may be a bit probative for many people, as legal fees can adapt to thousands pretty quickly.

[00:18:44.440] - Lucrezia
So, a popular option is to get templates drafted by lawyers. So, if you want the peace of mind that your business is legally compliant, and you won't risk fines at all or if you're not sure how to write your disclosure page. And you don't have the time to figure it out on your own time that you really spend doing what you do best, what can your, so your genius, creating content, engaging with your audience, and growing your blog. So, if you want to get rid of all the guesswork analytics, and you ask for something that is done for you and ready to go, something that make sure you meet all the legal requirements and keep you up to date with future changes in legislation, then I have something perfect for you. You have it, it's my plug and play disclosure template, but the beauty of it is that all the hard work is done for you.

[00:19:33.640] - Lucrezia
You can go through the courses at your own pace or jump straight to the Plug and Play templates, fill them out with your business or blog information and be done in a matter of minutes. These templates are all compliant with the Federal Trade Commission guidelines, but my disclosure template comes with extra bonuses, including special requirements for the Amazon associate programs, how to make your affiliate links not follow in compliance with Google refinement, and so much more. Thousands of creators, bloggers, coaches, podcasters, and other online entrepreneurs have already taken advantage of these templates. And you can be next. I contributed my disclosure templates to the all access pass, so you can have free access to it when you upgrade to the all access pass.

[00:20:18.360] - Lucrezia
So, just upgrade to the all access pass, and you can have all your disclosures done in a matter of seconds. All right. So, we reached the end of our time together. As promised, I have a gift for you. You can get my plug and play professionally trust copyright notice template to protect your content, your blog post, plus ebooks, courses, freebies, printables, or any other type of content emerges that you create. This is an amazing template that every content creators and bloggers should have. And you can have it for free today. This copyright notice template will claim ownership of your content and make clear that no one can steal it from you. So, you automatically own the copyright to your original work the moment you create.

[00:21:06.390] - Lucrezia
You don't need to register your work for the trademark register it for yours to be, for your work to be yours. But if you have a copyright notice, you will remind everyone that they can't copy, use, or reproduce your work without your consent. So, a copyright notice will lend you more legitimates to your ownership. They will act as a deterrent for those who may want to steal it, and you may guarantee more copyright protection for your work. So, you can use this template, place a copyright notice with the name and years of your business and copyrights, or your blog, and a copyright statement informing of your rights.

[00:21:46.630] - Lucrezia
And now others are allowed or not allowed to use your content on all your work. For example, on your website, on your blog, the resources that you make available, your blog posts, all your freebies you offer, your classes, your courses, your books, anything. So that you always protected from thieves and copy cats. All right. So, go grab your gift. I hope you learned ton.

[00:22:10.840] - Lucrezia
I really enjoyed our session. Thank you so much for your time with me today, and I hope I will see you soon. Thank you all. Bye for now. Ciao. God bless them.

**Title:** Legal Disclaimers Every Bloggers Must Know

**Year:** 2024
**Lesson Link:** https://doublejacksmedia.thrivecart.com/l/smart-summit-library/legal-disclaimers-every-bloggers-must-know-michelle-murphy-2024/

**Transcript:**
[00:00:03.240] - Michelle Murphy
Hello there, and welcome to my presentation on ""Legal Disclaimers Every Blogger Must Know."" In this presentation we're going to go over what a disclaimer is, legal disclaimers that bloggers need to know, the importance of placement, and then we will also go over how to write a disclaimer, and I will give you some examples. Before we get into it, hello there. My name is Michelle Murphy. I'm a small-business attorney and the owner of the ""CEO Legal Loft."" I work with online business owners to ensure that they are legally protected and avoiding costly legal mistakes. In my free time, you can find me watching Psych or Hallmark movies.

[00:00:56.310] - Michelle
So first, what is a disclaimer? It's a notice or a statement designed to limit the liability of a party associated with a website, such as you, if you're the owner of the website or other parties like your employers or customers. It may also inform users of certain risks associated with using the website, such as if it contains adult themes or material that may be offensive to some users.

[00:01:26.950] - Michelle
So what legal disclaimers do you need to know as a blogger? First is ""Representations and Warranties."" This limits your liability regarding the condition of what you're selling. It's also known as the ""as-is"" clause. In the case of a website the visitor has to do their own research and due diligence on the information you provide on your website.

[00:01:47.090] - Michelle
Next we have ""Omissions, Errors, and Mistakes"" disclaimer. This is just saying that the website owner is not liable for any errors or mistakes on their website.

[00:01:56.090] - Michelle
Next we have the ""No Professional-Client Relationship"" disclaimer. This is for my bloggers who are in the finance industry, legal industry, medical industry, you're a therapist, any of those types of clientele. You're basically saying just because you're consuming content on my website does not mean that you are my client. And even if you're not in those industries, if you take clients, you can also add this. So for my copywriters, graphic designers, all you guys.

[00:02:32.810] - Michelle
Next we have an ""Earnings"" disclaimer. In an earnings disclaimer, you're telling people that any income claims that you make are not guaranteed to work for someone who has purchased or downloaded content from your website, or even consumed content on your website, so if you have a blog.

[00:02:48.170] - Michelle
Next we have a ""Testimonials"" disclaimer. This is for people who have reviews on their website. This is basically saying that your experience may not be the same experience as described in the reviews. I'll say this, there's a little bit more that goes into earnings and testimonial-type disclaimers, but that gets really into the nitty-gritty of the FTC, and I don't want to bog you down with that. Basically they're saying, if you have these types of statements on your website, and it is the norm, then you need to have some type of proof and evidence to back that up. If it is not the norm, if this is abnormal, if it is abnormal for someone to make $10,000 from your program, and somebody has put that on their review, you should not be using that review. That's what the FTC has said about using this type of content on your website. So if you allow comments on your blog you're saying that any comments that were made are not the views or beliefs of the operator of the website, so you, and that you as the operator, shouldn't be held responsible for those comments.

[00:04:12.110] - Michelle
Next let's talk about disclosures. Even though we're talking about disclaimers, disclosures are still very important, especially in the blogger world, especially these two that I'm about to start discussing. Basically, a disclosure according to the FTC is saying that you have some type of financial, maybe employment, maybe personal or family relationship with the brand.

[00:04:38.220] - Michelle
The first disclosure we're discussing is an ""Affiliates"" disclosure. I know you all know what this is. You are just informing users that you have a relationship with the company for a product you're promoting, reviewing, or recommending, and you're getting a commission from it.

[00:04:52.850] - Michelle
Next we have a ""Sponsored Post"" disclosure. This is if the brand is paying you to display specific content to show to your audience. I assume you already know the difference between affiliates and sponsored posts, but usually sponsored posts, you are getting paid beforehand or you're getting paid a set amount. It doesn't matter how much you convert. It doesn't matter — there's no dependency on someone buying something from you in a sponsored post, whereas affiliates you get commissions based on if somebody has purchased a product using a specific link.

[00:05:31.580] - Michelle
Next, we have a ""Copyright Notice."" This is a statement that's placed on copies of work to inform the public that a copyright owner is claiming ownership of it. You can put this on the Footer of your website. You can put it in your e-books. You can put it basically anywhere that you have content on. The format of this is the copyright symbol © or the word 'copyright' or the abbreviation COPR, the year of first publication of the work, and the name of the copyright owner. Here it is in real-time. You see the © 2020 - 2023 Michelle W. Murphy, LLC.

[00:06:05.360] - Michelle
Next, let's talk about the importance of placement of your disclaimers. There's no specific law that explains where a disclaimer should be, but it should capture the attention, and it should be obvious. The FTC states that it should be positioned in connection with the content being disclaimed, so it stands out from the rest of the content, and is in an obvious location. You can put this on a separate page and link it in the Footer, or you can explicitly place it on a page like a blog or a sales page. Last but not least, you can put them inside of your Terms and Conditions. Just to show you an example of placement of a disclaimer, here's one on my website.

[00:06:49.960] - Michelle
You can see my Legal Disclaimers right here, right below the orange box where it says, ""I need this for only $7."" There is a legal disclaimer that says, ""This challenge is for educational purposes and is not legal advice. This challenge is not a substitute for an attorney."" Additionally, I have a ""Professional-Client"" disclaimer in the checkout section of this sales page, and it says, ""The items in this bundle, including the guide, templates, podcast, and checklist, are not legal advice and is for educational/informational purposes only. Neither the purchase of this template nor the included information form an attorney-client relationship.""

[00:07:28.440] - Michelle
Next, let's discuss what should be put inside of disclaimer. The language should be purposeful. Start by clearly stating the purpose of your blog and the intent behind the content. An example would be, ""The content on this blog is intended for informational purposes only."" Specificity. Avoid vague phrases. Be as specific as possible about what your blog covers and does not cover. You can say something like, ""While we strive to provide accurate information on X topic, we do not claim to be experts in Y or Z fields."" The Limitation of Liability disclaimers. You're going to clearly state that the information you provide is based on your personal opinions or research and that you're not liable for any outcomes based on the use of this information. An example of this would be, ""Readers are advised to consult with a professional before making any decisions based on the content of this blog. We are not responsible for any actions taken due to the information provided."" 

[00:08:28.900] - Michelle
You want to make clear distinctions so if you occasionally write sponsored content or blog reviews, clearly differentiate them from your other content. Saying something like, ""Some articles on this blog may be sponsored or contain affiliate links, which will be clearly indicated."" Additionally, on the actual blog — You can put this in your Terms and Conditions or something like that, or on the blog page, depending on how your website is set up. If you have just a blogs page you can put it on that page, something like this, ""Some of the articles on this blog may be sponsored."" But on the actual post, if you have a sponsored post, you need to put that, ""This blog post is sponsored."" Same with blog posts that have affiliate links. You need to say, ""This blog post has affiliate links contained inside. I will get a commission if you use these links."" It doesn't have to be super like, you don't have to say, ""I'll get a 30% commission."" You don't have to be super specific. You don't have to say how much you're getting paid. You just need to at least let people know that you are getting paid for this content, or for using your links. And that is all you need to know from a blogger standpoint about disclaimers.

**Transcript:**
[00:00:12.610] - Nicole
Hi, and welcome to today's session, Brand Protection with Federal Trademark registration. My name is Nicole Cheri Oden, and I am married to my high school sweetheart. We have an almost seven year old little girl, and I'm a licensed attorney in the state of California. I have my own virtual boutique law firm, Nicole Cheri Oden Law P.C, as well as an online business, which is legal templates and more, providing legal templates and resources for other online service providers and digital product creators. So today, we're going to chat not only about what a trademark is, we're also going to cover the benefits of federal trademark registration for your blog and your online business.

[00:00:54.370] - Nicole
The importance of doing a comprehensive search sooner rather than later, and a bit about what a comprehensive search is, as well as three questions to ask yourself to decide if your business is ready to move forward with federal trademark registration. Before I launch in, know that everything I share is legal education and information. It's not business, financial, or legal advice. It doesn't create an attorney client relationship between us.

[00:01:21.130] - Nicole
You definitely want to chat with an attorney in your local area. And since I'm licensed in California, in the United States, everything I share today is going to be from the perspective of United States law. Okay? So with that in mind, let's first cover the key distinction between a brand and a trademark, because while they are lumped together frequently, they actually are two very different things. So a brand is the personality, character, identity, reputation, really the goodwill that your blog and online business have built that's recognized by the public.

[00:01:59.850] - Nicole
So you actually build your community and you sell because of your brand. A trademark, on the other hand, represents your brand in the marketplace, and it helps consumers identify your blog or online business as the source of products or services. So a trademark is a word, phrase, logo, graphic, or symbol that ties to your brand. For discussion purposes, today, we're going to lump trademarks and service marks under the umbrella of trademark. There is a difference.

[00:02:34.600] - Nicole
So trademarks tied to goods versus service marks tied to services. Under the law, they are used pretty interchangeably, and we're going to do so today. So what does this brand verse trademark distinction have anything to do with your blog and your online business? Well, let's take a step back. I can almost guarantee that in your family, there is a distinct preference for one product or service over another with a different competing company for some specific reason. The ones that just come to mind for me are the Coca Cola versus Pepsi debate.

[00:03:07.900] - Nicole
I'm sure your family falls on one side of the line or the other. There is a very distinct difference in how the products taste, in my humble opinion. They also have very distinct feelings behind their messaging, and they have very distinct trademarks. So with CocaCola, you think of that white script font with Pepsi, you think of the white, red and blue, and they have a very distinct, bold block font. 

[00:03:36.720] - Nicole
Think about shoewear if the Pepsi-Coke debate's not for your family, what about the Nike Swoosh versus the Adidas three lines? You maybe have a preference versus the comfort and the wearability of one or the other. But again, both products also have a very distinct brand behind them. Taking it to the online space, I know bloggers sometimes have a very definitive opinion on the type of website that they want to establish their blog on. Be that WordPress, be that Squarespace, or Wix, or all of these other emerging platforms that you can use.

[00:04:09.860] - Nicole
There are two components to this conversation, the brand, the reason behind why you choose to lean toward one or the other, and their trademarks that differentiate them in the marketplace. You would know picking up a can of soda, what's Coke and what's Pepsi? That's because of their trademark. So what can be a trademark? This is your blog, business, podcast, product and service names, your logo, slogans, tagline, those are all trademarks from the moment that you start using them.

[00:04:42.280] - Nicole
Interestingly enough, other things that can be trademarks, can be sounds, smells, and color schemes if they identify your blog or online business as the source of products or services. So some examples, sounds, we are probably all familiar with that, NBC Chime, that is a registered trademark. Smell, playdoh, weirdly enough, the smell of playdoh is a registered trademark. Color scheme, Tiffany blue, we all know what it is.

[00:05:14.370] - Nicole
Registered trademark, they all tie to a specific product or service. Now, when I said that your blog and online business names, product and service names, all these things are trademarks, that is true. There is a difference, though, between what we call common law trademarks and registered trademarks. So the United States has what's called a first in use system, meaning you have trademark protection simply by using the mark in the marketplace first. So the second that you launch your blog using a blog name, trademark, the second that you launch your ecommerce store selling journals and t shirts, trademark.

[00:05:56.370] - Nicole
But the protections for that common law, unregistered trademarked limited, limited to the geographic area that your business is located and where you're using the mark. So let's say that for discussion purposes, you launch a small store in Arkansas and you just sell to neighboring states. That is the zone of reach of your trademark. Now, it gets a little bit blurry, especially for bloggers and online businesses, because the internet essentially makes it possible for people from potentially other countries to read your blog to purchase things from your ecommerce store. So there's a new, more nuanced analysis when it comes to blogs and online businesses in terms of the reach.

[00:06:50.060] - Nicole
That being said, if you register your trademark with the United States Continent Trademark Office or USPTO, you get protection in all 50 states, among other benefits, which we're going to talk about in a minute. But that's even if you haven't started selling to some of these other states, so let's say you have your business in Arkansas that starts an ecommerce store, and now you're making sales in 25 of the 50 states. Irrespective, you still get protection in all 50 states if you decide to move forward with federal trademark registration. So what are some of the other benefits of registration?

[00:07:26.470] - Nicole
So we talked about those exclusive rights that you get across the United States, but you get the ability to enforce them. And we're going to talk about that in a minute. One of the other cool things is you also get the ability to use that R in a circle. So if you reach registration, you can use that symbol next to your trademark to alert potential infringes of your registration. Sidebar, you do not want to use that symbol unless you have a registered trademark because you could be found guilty of fraud.

[00:07:58.680] - Nicole
Going to stop there. Not going to go more into it because I'm limited in time today. But you want to make sure that you're only using that symbol if you have a registered trademark. Now the little TM for trademark and the little SM for service mark, you can use those to assert your rights, you know next to your blog name, next to podcast name. But don't transition to the r in a circle unless you have actually achieved registration.

[00:08:25.610] - Nicole
So I talked about being able to enforce your exclusive rights across the United States because of registration. And that means you can actually sue if somebody infringes on your mark in federal court. And with that, if you are successful in your infringement lawsuit, you recover attorney's fees and damages. And that means they are statutorily provided. If somebody infringes on your mark, you have to take them to court and you win.

[00:08:51.420] - Nicole
You get damages and attorney's fees because of their bad behavior, essentially. Another cool thing, especially if you have goods, so if you have an ecommerce store that provides journals, t-shirts, candles, all sorts of physical goods, you can actually file your registration with the United States Customs Service to prevent the importation of infringing goods. So they will have that registration, and as things are being imported, they scan them to make sure that there's not an infringement issue.

[00:09:26.080] - Nicole
And if there is, they actually, you know, deny the goods from being brought into the country. It also makes the experience of registering your mark in foreign countries much more expeditious if you already have a registration here in the United States. And this is increasingly important for bloggers and online businesses because we are essentially an international commerce at this point. So I mean, we are all connected because of the interwebs, and so you may start small and build into other countries, UK, Canada, Australia, Asia.

[00:10:01.160] - Nicole
The sky really is the limit, and that is the beauty of online business, so something to consider. And one of I think the greatest things about federal tradmark registration is you gain a very valuable asset for your company. So maybe you started a small business and you weren't kind of trying to plan to take it to a behemoth business, so a large corporate entity, maybe that is in the cards and that's kind of where you're planning on taking it. It is an asset to your company. If you are building a business to sell, one of the pieces of the due diligence process that the purchasing company will come to is actually evaluate to see if you have registrations for your trademarks in place, because that adds value to your brand and to your business.

[00:10:47.210] - Nicole
That is because, and I'm going to explain why in a minute, but copyright and patent protections are time limited. So not getting into what copyright and patent protections are, whole other conversation. And since I'm time limited today, will just suffice it to say that when you register those specific forms of IP, the protections are good for a limited period of time. This is where the value comes in with federal trademark registration. That is not true. With federal trademark registration, it could potentially last indefinitely so long as you continue using the mark and you stay current with your maintenance and renewal filing. 

[00:11:30.110] - Nicole
A lasting legacy for your business or your blog and it's definitely something that you want to consider for the long term. I think a lot of online businesses start small. Sometimes there's a side hustle and things can escalate and grow and expand, and that is an amazing thing. Planning to make sure that you have that asset in your back pocket can be very beneficial for you.

[00:11:52.240] - Nicole
But a word of caution. So you can have a trademark from the moment that you start using this. It is a trademark with limited protections whether or not you choose to register. But it's important to do a comprehensive search sooner rather than later. And that's because even if your trademark, let's go with your blog name, is not an exact match for another.

[00:12:15.730] - Nicole
It may be similar enough that a consumer is likely to be confused by the source of that service, or a product if you have an ecommerce store. Trademarks function to protect consumers, so think back to the beginning of the presentation where we were talking Coke versus Pepsi, Adidas versus Nike, you know other distinctions that you can think about competing, dueling products or services in the same industry. When you're walking down the marketplace, be that the grocery store, target aisles, let's talk about the cereal aisle, for example. There are hundreds of brands of cereal and you can probably differentiate between them because of their trademarks. That is the function of a trademark.

[00:13:03.710] - Nicole
So if you launch your brand without seeing if you're infringing or close enough to some other brand that's in the marketplace, you're putting yourself at risk of being on the receiving end of a cease and desist letter. Potentially, facing an expensive rebrand, because we all know how expensive it can be if we're not DIYing to bring on a website designer, a copywriter, graphic designer, all these things to launch our online business or our blog. And you may even have to hand over the profits that you earned while you were using the marking question. So a comprehensive search really is a key investment for your online business and brand. Period.

[00:13:45.730] - Nicole
End of story. That is because in trademark law, likelihood of confusion are the keywords that you need to pay attention to. A comprehensive federal, state and common law search looks to first the similarity of the mark and then the relatedness of the goods and services to determine if a likelihood of confusion exists, among other things. And we'll talk about that in a minute. But let's first focus on likelihood of confusion because this tends to be one of the biggest issues and one of the biggest reasons that we see refusals to register with the USPTO.

[00:14:22.360] - Nicole
So let's take Delta for an example. Delta Airlines, flight services, right? Delta faucet, your kitchen or bathroom sink. You're probably not going to confuse an airline service with a faucet. So the likelihood of confusion here, not a big issue, but let's say Starbucks, we all know Starbucks, right?

[00:14:48.990] - Nicole
And you decide to launch a coffee company using the name Starbucks, you just add an S. Okay? So similarity of the marks, it's the same exact mark with an extra S on the end relatedness of the goods and services, you're selling coffee in a coffee shop, you know, situation, there's a likelihood of confusion that exists. But let's take this a step further. The mark does not have to be an exact match for likelihood of confusion to exist.

[00:15:20.060] - Nicole
So different spelling, eight and eight different spelling, different words ostensibly, but perhaps they function the same in the mark. It could happen, there could be a likelihood of confusion issue. Misspelling. The common example I like to give is EZ, E-A-S-Y versus EZ. It has the same impression, although they are spelt differently, singular and plural versions.

[00:15:50.610] - Nicole
So this is the Starbucks version. Let's also turn to Nordstrom. Nordstrom, most of us know is a department store and it is of registered trademark. But one of the things I like to point out is if you go to the USPTO's website, they have the ability for you to search all of the registered trademarks, both live and dead, meaning ones that are existing trademarks and ones that were registered and for whatever reason, were either canceled or they just failed to file maintenance documents, and so they were abandoned.

[00:16:26.960] - Nicole
They also show pending application, which is good for you to be able to kind of search to see is there a likelihood of confusion issue with my mark? But this is a big bet, if you go, it's called the trademark electronic search system or test on USPTO's website and you type in Nordstrom, that extracts on the end and that basic search function, nothing's going to pop up. So if you're not doing a deep dive and really doing the comprehensive search, you may think you're in the clear to be able to use Nordstrom for departing store services even though there is a registration already in place for Nordstrom. Foreign language equivalents are another thing you need to look out for.

[00:17:10.320] - Nicole
So let's say the name of your blog incorporates Luna. Well, if there's another blog that has Moon in the same order of words as your blog, that could be likelihood of confusion issue. Hyphenated and non-hyphenated versions, sticking a random hyphen or different symbols that represent letters into a trademark could be a likelihood of confusion issue. These are all things that you have to pay attention to when you're thinking about naming blog name, product name, service name, tagline, all these options that you have to use as trademarks in your online business.

[00:17:46.470] - Nicole
And the sky's the limit in terms of being creative, in terms of using trademarks. But you do want to make sure that you have the ability to use the mark. I mentioned earlier that likelihood of confusion is one of the biggest reasons that we see refusal to register at the USPTO. You know, there's other things to consider, is the mark descriptive?

[00:18:06.690] - Nicole
Is it generic? Does it fail to function as a trademark? One of the common examples that I give is for T-shirts. A lot of times people will launch any commerce brands and put T-shirts in the store. And while the market may function as a name for the ecommerce store, it's probably not going to function for T-shirts as a registration if it's just a design on the front of the shirt because it doesn't designate the source of the product or service.

[00:18:35.670] - Nicole
It's just decorative, it's ornamental. So there are a lot of things to consider and unfortunately, I don't have enough time to dive into it all. But I wanted to touch on likelihood of confusion, because I think it's the spot that I see online business owners and bloggers get tripped up the most on, because they'll have inspiration from somewhere.

[00:18:55.500] - Nicole
They run with it, they launch, without doing that deep dive search to make sure that they are in the clear. And I really want to prevent people from being on the receiving end of those cease and desist letters because it can get not only stressful but very expensive very quickly depending on, you know who's on the other side.

[00:19:15.590] - Nicole
So I'm not going to dive into the actual registration process itself, which would be a whole other 30 minutes talk since I'm time-limited today. But let's say you do the comprehensive search and find no issues. So there are two types of applications that you can choose to file with USPTO. There's both an in use application and an intent-to-use application. So in use just means that you are actually using the trademark in interstate or international commerce.

[00:19:44.800] - Nicole
So for goods, this means it's on the goods, or if it's for your ecommerce store, it's posted in the ecommerce store. And you are actually making sales. For services like your blog, by way of example, it's being used in the rendering of your blog.

[00:20:00.970] - Nicole
So you actually have a readership that marks there on the blog. It's visibly displayed and people tie your posts to your blog. An Intent to use application, and I'm going to make a case for why, I think this is one of the underused tools for online business owners is when you actually file the registration application because you have a good faith intent to use the trademark within the next six months of filing, but you're not actually using it yet. So maybe you have considered launching a blog or you've considered adding an ecommerce store to your website and you have this catchy name.

[00:20:36.700] - Nicole
You've done the search, you don't see any issues, but you want to get that protective filing date first before opening it up and sharing with the community. And I'm going to talk about why that's smart in a couple of slides, so bear with me. You would file an intent to use application. Both have different processes.

[00:20:53.830] - Nicole
Again, not talking about what the registration process looks like today, but it's important to know that there are two types of applications that you can use. And that is because how long do you think it takes from the time an application is submitted to the time it reaches registration? Just going to pause for a couple of seconds.

[00:21:15.910] - Nicole
So it used to be that you filed a registration application and you could reach registration if you had no issues come up if you didn't receive an office action, which is essentially a written correspondence from the USPTO that finds some sort of issue with your trademark application that prevents it from moving forward with registration. Six months, six months. And then came COVID and the rise of online businesses and businesses in general, and the time frame between submitting an application to registration has increased to about a year. And it is moving upward.

[00:21:56.640] - Nicole
They did recently bring on some new examining attorneys at the USPTO. They're trying to hire more. There is still a backlog. So the quicker that you move, the quicker that you file and get that protective date, the less you have to worry about because it's filed. And as I said, I can't get into registration specifics, but I do believe that an intent to use application can be an amazing tool for online businesses.

[00:22:23.190] - Nicole
And I'm going to talk about that. Why? Why does it matter for bloggers and online business owners? Now it's the unfortunate time for some horror stories that I have seen as an attorney in the online space, the first one being one that happens relatively recently. I had an online business owner company she was working with a coach, and she shared kind of this idea that she had to launch a specific product in the online business space.

[00:22:53.110] - Nicole
She didn't have a contract with this coach, which is a whole other issue that we had to talk about. We made sure that she is using contracts in her business and will be signing contracts for every professional relationship that she engages going forward. But this coach turned around and registered the market their own, started a separate part of the business, and ran with this online business owner's idea. Trademarks do not protect ideas. So let me just say that, if you have an idea, a concept, it could be protected by an NDA, which is a non-disclosure agreement or some other provision, confidentiality provision in a contract. She hadn't launched yet.

[00:23:35.040] - Nicole
It was just a discussion she had with the coach. The coach ran with it. She didn't. She had to go back to the drawing board, and it was a frustrating lesson for her. I had a blogger come to me who spent a ton of money on their website and their branding without doing a comprehensive search.

[00:23:53.160] - Nicole
So they had a catchy blog name that already existed, and they didn't poke around to see if that was true or not. They just launched and spent a pretty penny and got that cease and desist letter. And so, they not only had to take everything down and rebrand, but they had the headache and the stress of being on the receiving end of receiving this letter because they didn't do a little bit of legwork first. I had an online business owner who bought a domain name thinking that was the same thing as trademark protection. Little tip here.

[00:24:29.060] - Nicole
So if you are thinking about launching a new product, a new service, running with something else in your business, people do monitor IP hosting platforms and domain sites to see what's being purchased, to potentially go file intent to use marks and vice versa. They may monitor to see what's being filed as an intent to use or any application, and then go try and do a search for domains, try and tie them up. They're not the same thing, but it can be a headache. So this online business owner bought the domain, started doing a bunch of stuff, assumed it was trademark protection. It wasn't.

[00:25:09.180] - Nicole
She found out afterwards that there was a business owner that was using the same name, essentially, and had priorities. They've been using the mark and they had actually submitted a trademark registration application. So she had to go start rebuilding with a whole different brand and concept. I had a blogger who shared that they intended to file an intent to use application with their audience, so they had it filed. It was, again, just a concept, and they shared it publicly.

[00:25:41.160] - Nicole
Well, one of their audience members liked the idea so much that they took it verbatim and filed for registration and got an in use date first. So it's important as an online business owner to be cognizant of what you are running with in terms of your brand and your business. Because you want to make sure that if you're drawing that figurative line in the sand, if you're building that community and that goodwill, it's not on borrowed ground. Side note, you also want to make sure that you are sharing with people that you're comfortable with, as you have a non-disclosure agreement in place or contract with a confidentiality provision, and there's teeth, so if there's a breach, you can go after them.

[00:26:27.760] - Nicole
So put that in your pocket for future use. But these are just some of the horror stories that I've heard with business owners who fail to really put trademark registration in the forefront of their mind and factor into their business plan.

[00:26:43.660] - Nicole
So how do you know if you're ready to move forward with federal trademark registration? I have three questions that you really want to consider and ask yourself. The first being, do you have a profitable product or service? And as a blogger, let's say that you're maybe not making money off your blog per se. Maybe you are doing affiliate marketing or you have sponsorships or other things that are going on with your blog.

[00:27:05.410] - Nicole
If you are building an audience, a readership, a reach, you can factor that in here as well. Number two is do you intend to stick with your product or service? So if the timeline to reach registration with the USPTO is a year, and this is something that you're just kind of launching to see that sticks and it, you know, may go away in six months, chances are you may not want to submit for registration. If it is something to where you're building a legacy. And this blog is going to be something that you have for years and years to come, or your online business with an Ecommerce store and you really want to build this thing big and be able to maybe sell it down the line, you want to factor that into your decision making.

[00:27:49.210] - Nicole
And finally, do you plan to stop others from infringing on your trademark? So getting to the registration point is amazing, getting that shiny certificate, although news flash, we don't get hard copies of your trademark registration anymore with the fancy gold seal on them. Unfortunately, now it is an electronic copy and even if you order courtesy copy, a display copy of the certificate, it's truncated, so it's definitely not as pretty. And there's been some rumbling behind the scenes trying to get the USPTO to change that to at least make the display copies a little bit prettier.

[00:28:23.670] - Nicole
We'll see if anything comes of that. But once you reach registration, you also want to make sure that you're putting other people on notice that you're not comfortable if they get too close to your mark or if they start to infringe on your rates. So this is something to maybe sit down with a trademark attorney and talk about and how that factors into your online business or your blog planning, you know. Are you to be having somebody that's monitoring to make sure that there's no potentially infringing applications being filed or setting up a Google alert is a great way, and it's no cost to you as a business owner. You know you put the phrase or the name in Google alert and have it send you a weekly email updating you on any use of these, so that you can kind of monitor.

[00:29:06.540] - Nicole
But you do want to make sure that you're telling people, no, you can't infringe on my marks because you have the obligation as a trademark owner to protect that mark or potentially face, you know, the counter arguing that you've kind of diluted the strength of your mark if you haven't protected it. So those are the three questions as you're contemplating if this is something you want to move forward with to kind of consider. Can you conduct a search and apply for registration on your own? Yes. That's the short answer. Of course, you can. You can go to the USPTO's website.

[00:29:38.610] - Nicole
There are a plethora of resources. Like I said, you can use that test system, the trademark electronic search system to poke around and see if there are any likelihood of confusion issues. It's not as easy as it looks. I will say, even as an attorney who's done the Boolean searches, because that's what it is, there's a whole search method. It's not that easy, quite frankly.

[00:30:02.510] - Nicole
And to really go in and identify potential likelihood of confusion issues, look at existing trademark law, and decide if there is a genericism issue, if there is a descriptiveness issue, you know, if it's really truly functioning as a trademark. I believe that working with a trademark attorney is one of the best investments that you can make for your online business, for your blog. Because it ensures that you get much better guidance and advice. There is a much smoother and less stressful experience of being able to work with a professional who understands the registration process, and you actually have an increased chance of getting to a successful registration. Because they have that knowledge of trademark law, all the nuances, what the process looks like, which I know, you know because of time constraints we couldn't get into today. But there's much more than just submitting an application and getting to registration. So if you are ready to lock down your brand with federal trademark registration, I would love to chat with you and you can learn more and book a consult at nicolecheriodenlaw.com/trademark.

[00:31:06.720] - Nicole
The website right there. Thank you so much for joining me today to chat federal trademark registration and protecting your online business and blog. If you have questions, you can feel free to reach out. I will point you in the right direction of, you know, a resource, but just know that I can't give specific advice unless there is a sign retainer agreement with my law firm. I hope that you have an amazing rest of your day.

[00:00:10.260] - Nicole Cheri Oden, nicolecherioden.com
Hey, hey, welcome to Terms of Use for Your Digital Products. Before I launch in, I'm going to give a little bit of an introduction about me and my businesses.

[00:00:21.870] - Nicole
So, my name is Nicole Cheri Oden. I am married to my high school sweetheart. We have been married for over ten years now, but together for 14, we have an almost five year old little girl and a 13 year old Jack Russell terrier. And I'm a licensed attorney in the state of California. So, I have my own law practice. Nicole Cheri Oden Law. And I also have an online business, Nicole SEO Cheri LLC, where I provide legal templates for other online business owners so that they can make sure they are legally protecting their online businesses while keeping their sanity.

[00:00:56.730] - Nicole
We are going to cover a lot of ground today, what our terms of use key provisions to include in your terms of use and making sure that your terms of use are enforceable.

[00:01:08.900] - Nicole
But before I launch in, I'm going to give my standard disclaimer, everything we'll chat about today is legal education and information. It is not business, financial or legal advice. It does not create an attorney client relationship between us. And since I am a United States attorney, everything I share is going to be from the perspective of a United States law. You definitely want to consult with an attorney in your area who understands your particular business situation so that you can take the right steps for you and your business.

[00:01:38.510] - Nicole
I like to note that in the United States, contract law is state specific. There are kind of overarching universal concepts, and that's what we're going to cover today. But this is why I do say it's important to chat with an attorney in your area.

[00:01:54.790] - Nicole
So, let's first dive into what our terms of use. If you offer some sort of an e-course or a membership or any type of downloadable product like a worksheet or templates, you definitely want to make sure you have terms of use in a place. So, terms of use are a contract between you and your customers. Interestingly enough, they aren't legally required, but they are the first place a court will look if you have a dispute with one of your customers. So that's why I think it is imperative, no matter what, if you have some sort of digital product, you need to have terms of use in place. And that is because they are the ground rules for your online product. And this is the first fill in the blank on your worksheet, the ground rules for your online products.

[00:02:42.810] - Nicole
And I'm going to cover some of the key provisions. You want to make sure your terms of use include beginning with your payment options. So, this provision really should clearly articulate four things, and that is what is the payment for? So is it an e-commerce? Is it some sort of downloadable product specifically outline what the payment is for? Number two, how much is due, i.e. the price? You're going to be very clear about what the price of the product is.

[00:03:13.850] - Nicole
The third thing is how the payment is structured, so is it a lump sum? Is it a monthly payment? Be very, very clear. And the fourth thing, when is payment due. Is at time of purchase? Is it the first of the month? So, let's say you have a membership. So, payments come out automatically, either deducted from whatever card the purchaser uses. You want to be very clear about when the payment is due.

[00:03:36.680] - Nicole
And as a note, if you actually offer multiple products, you can refer to a specific sales page, but you want to make sure that the four things I discussed above are included. One, what the payment is for, two, how much is do? Three, how the payment is structured. And four when payment is due. And you want to make sure that you are retaining records of exactly what your sales page says on the specific dates.

[00:04:03.170] - Nicole
It's evidence down the road if an issue arises so that you can reference that to be very, very clear about what the payments included and how it was structured.

[00:04:13.530] - Nicole
The next provision is your refund policy, so you want to be sure that you include your refund policy, and that is even if it is no refunds, that's perfectly fine. But you want to be very clear about it. And that's something that I like to actually put on the sales page, as well as in the terms of use so that it's not buried. I think it's better to just be very clear from the outset if you're not going to be giving refunds that. That's clearly articulated, I mean, it's just so much better from a consumer perspective, if you visit a page and you don't have to root around to figure out what the refund policy is and if you do offer some sort of refund, you want to be very clear about the terms. How soon do they have to request a refund? Is there any sort of proof that they have to send, let's say that you have some sort of membership and do they need to complete all of the modules? Whatever it may be clearly articulate. You're going to hear me repeat that several times throughout today's lesson. But you want to be very, very clear.

[00:05:15.730] - Nicole
I also like to include a note that chargebacks won't be tolerated. So, if you don't know what a chargeback is, that is when somebody makes a purchase using their credit card and then they dispute the charge with the credit card company. It is a huge headache. And that is why it's so important that you understand how your particular payment processor responds to chargebacks. It's not if, it's when, unfortunately, but it is something that you definitely want to be aware of for that reason in terms of how the process goes. So, that's just a little side note.

[00:05:46.480] - Nicole
So, we chatted about payment options, we chatted about the refund policy. I also like to include a provision that addresses how your content can and can't be used, and that is an intellectual property provision. Is your product something that a consumer can use for personal or commercial use? Let's use the example of social media templates. If you offer those templates, is it something that is just for the person to download and use for themselves and perhaps their online business? Or is it something that they can download and then turn around and particularize for clients or customers and resell? So, you want to be very clear, personal or commercial use?

[00:06:30.100] - Nicole
I also like to include a few provisions if your product is for personal use, because it kind of specifies that you are really kind of drawing the line, drawing your line in the sand, that the product is for personal use. So, for instance, I like to include a provision that specifically states the purchaser cannot share their login credentials with other people or even sell or transfer their access, which is a commercial use at the end of the day. It's something that's very commonplace in the online space where people will sign up for a course or a membership and they'll decide to split the cost in the access with somebody. So, if you're very clear from the outset in your terms of use, that that's not something that you condone, you'll have that to stand on. And we'll talk about this in a minute when we get to the termination provision.

[00:07:17.950] - Nicole
Another provision I like to include in the intellectual property provision section is that your purchaser is not going to use your product to basically create a directly competing product. So, unfortunately, there are copycats out there. It happens somebody will purchase your product and then turn around, copy it and try and sell it themselves. If you have this provision in your terms of use, it's extra leverage if you ever have to basically stand on your terms of use in a dispute. So, those are some things I'd like to include. Really, the intellectual property provision is to specify your rights and how you're sticking your claim to them.

[00:07:58.640] - Nicole
So, another provision to include in your terms of use is the limitations of liability and disclaimers section. This section really is critical. You don't want to expose yourself to undue risk. And at the end of the day, we are laying out your terms so now that you don't have to fight about it later. So, that's why this is such a key-key provision. I like to include a clause that provides a very specific cumulative liability amount. So, in case you have a claim of rights, the amount is basically tied to your digital product and you indicate that by making the purchase, the customer is agreeing to that limitation of liability. So, as an example, let's go back to our social media template. Let's say you have some template bundle for twenty seven dollars. You would have a provision in your terms of use that says, ""If you have a dispute and if in any case you are held liable, the maximum amount that you will be held liable for is that twenty seven dollars."" So again, it's that threshold liability really minimizing any undue rescue could potentially face.

[00:09:07.190] - Nicole
Disclaimers, disclaimers, disclaimers, these are so important to include in your terms of use, especially if you're in a licensed industry. If you'll recall the disclaimer that I actually gave at the beginning of my presentation, I was very clear that I'm providing education and information and there's no attorney-client relationship created. Disclaimers are another step to insulate yourself from liability and to really make sure that you are being clear about what you are and you aren't doing. So, including those in your terms of use, I think is really key. A question I get a lot is should my disclaimers be standalone or should they be in my terms of use? And when we get to terms of use enforceability, you'll understand a little bit more. But I think that having your disclaimers included in your terms of use is actually a better practice.

[00:09:58.010] - Nicole
You could take it a step further and include those disclaimers on your sales page and the footage of your website. I don't think there's any harm in having them multiple places. I think it's actually kind of better because it shows that you're being very, very clear to your customers. But again, when it comes to enforceability and really being able to stand on those disclaimers and say, ""They're enforceable, you read and you agree to them."" I think having them in your terms of use is a really, really smart business practice. And we'll talk about why in a minute.

[00:10:29.370] - Nicole
So, I referenced earlier a right to terminate access provision, and this is key, especially in connection with a violation of your terms of use. So, it really is smart to include a provision that you have the right to terminate your customers access, especially if you have a course or membership if someone violates your terms.

[00:10:47.220] - Nicole
So earlier, I give the example of people splitting the cost and the login information for courses and memberships. If you find that out, if you have that right to terminate access provision, then you can go in and do so. Another example is, if you find out that somebody has been copying your material, you can go and terminate access and then you can move forward with seeking whatever relief it is and whatever way it is that you indicate in your terms of use.

[00:11:12.930] - Nicole
Which brings me to the next provision, which is a dispute resolution provision and that outlines how and where disputes will be handled. So, including a provision that specifically indicates where a dispute will be heard. So in what state and in what county and how it will be handled either in courts or by mediation or arbitration or some combination of those things really is key. And that is because under contract law, a dispute is typically heard where the contract was entered into or where the breaching party resides. So, I'm going to say that again, under contract law, a dispute is typically heard where the contract was entered into or where the breaching party resides; meaning the wrongdoing person. Which means in the age of Internet business, that people could be required to pursue their lawsuit in different states or even in different countries, which can be an immense headache. If you can deal with that headache from the outset and make sure that you have included a provision that says, ""Hey, if something goes awry, we're going to handle it in my state and in my county, you kind of have a leg up. So, it's really important that you include a dispute resolution provision in your terms of use. So, the final provision I'm going to cover is the third party, an affiliate link provision. So, this basically says if your digital product links to some other products or websites. You are not responsible for the experience or the purchase process on any website other than your own, and that if your customers experience goes awry, you have no liability.

[00:12:53.140] - Nicole
So, let's say you are a health coach and you have a course about losing 10 pounds in 10 weeks and you have a link to some shake that you recommend. You want to make sure that you're clearly indicating that if they click on that link, they're using their own judgment. If they go through and make the purchase, that's their decision. Yes, you're providing the link. But what they do after that is of their own volition. The same thing goes for affiliate links, so there is a lot of kind of legality is tied to being an affiliate, and that is because the Federal Trade Commission or the FTC handles how affiliates are able to market themselves and earn whatever it is that they're earning in terms of monetary income or free products or whatever it may be.

[00:13:47.390] - Nicole
So, you're required to actually include disclosure that you're an affiliate and you are receiving a benefit. So, if any of the links that you're providing are affiliate links, you have to be very, very clear to your product purchaser that they should use their own judgment and using that affiliate link. And again, if they use the link and the process goes awry or they're unhappy with the purchase, you have no liability whatsoever for that. So, those are the provisions that I highly recommend that you include in your terms of use. But I like to note this is not an exhaustive list. This was a high level overview of the things to consider, to make sure that it is a strong contract, because at the end of the day, that's what the terms of use are, their contract for you and your product to make sure that you are going to get paid and you're minimizing kind of your refund chargeback disputes down the road.

[00:14:47.090] - Nicole
So, we covered terms of use and what they are some high level what to include. Now, it's cover making sure your terms of use are enforceable, because at the end of the day, that is one of the most important things. It doesn't mean anything if you get your terms of use in place and they're not enforceable. So, that is why it is so imperative. You actually request that your customers affirmatively agree to your terms of use at the time of checkout.

[00:15:13.280] - Nicole
And this is before they enter their credit card information. They're shipping information, whatever it is that you require to purchase your products. This means they are using a method that requires them to take action. This is the second link on your worksheet, a method that requires them to take action. So, they are either checking a box, they're hitting the I agree button. Whatever it is, they're taking some sort of action. This creates an enforceable contract under the E-sign act, whether they choose to read the terms or not.

[00:15:43.990] - Nicole
So, as long as you've given them the opportunity to read the terms, if they choose not to do so, that's on them. You've provided the terms, they've click the button, they've checked the box, whatever it is that they read and agree to those terms; that is on them.

[00:16:01.780] - Nicole
Here is an example of my own on my website for my legal templates, they have to actually affirmatively check that box that says, ""I have read and agree to the website terms of use and the terms of use are linked to my policies on my website."" And this is required. They're not able to even click the button and proceed to put the purchase information in [their name, their credit card information] until that box is checked. They don't want to agree; so bad, so sad, but it is required to make a purchase on my website.

[00:16:36.080] - Nicole
And you definitely, definitely, definitely want to keep records of your terms of use, and this is something that I want to highlight. So, a lot of the time people will start online businesses. They may kind of do a Google search and find some sort of template and slap it up on their website and call it a day, which I do not recommend. Let's just say Google should not be your go-to for legal. We'll just leave it at that. But once you have the terms of use in place, you have to continually monitor to make sure you're keeping records not only of the terms of use you currently have in place, but any previous versions and the dates that they were in use. So, you may be updating your terms of use down the line to add products to maybe even change your refund policy. You know, if you're changing your address, whatever it is that you're changing in your terms of use you want to keep records of. Okay, I changed my terms of use on November 30th, 2020. The previous version were in effect from January 1st 2018 until that date. And put those somewhere.

[00:17:42.710] - Nicole
I'm a huge proponent of having a document management system for your business, even something as simple as Google Drive. You have them somewhere that you can reference them down the line. If you have an issue come up, it's just extra peace of mind for you because your I's are dotted or T's are crossed. If you have an issue, come up, because at the end of the day, that's really what legal is for. If something happens, you have this protection in place. Legal is like an insurance policy. It's not fun. I know a lot of people like to stick their head in the sand and not deal with it. But you're so thankful that you've done it and you've dealt with it when that issue comes up.

[00:18:19.950] - Nicole
I also recommend you keep records of the fact that your customers have to agree to your terms before they're even able to make the purchase, and this is the third thing on the worksheet before proceeding to make any purchase. So, I want to say this again. I recommend you keep records that show a customer has to agree to your terms before proceeding to make a purchase. And that can be as simple as setting up a Zoom video on your computer and walking through the purchase process and showing that it won't let your customer proceed until they've actually clicked that terms of use. You can walk through showing that once they click it, what the terms of your show and save that in your document management system, in Google Drive, ShareFile and Dropbox, whatever it is that you use. Again, it's proof for you if you have a dispute, come up down the line, which at the end of the day is priceless.

[00:19:12.690] - Nicole
So, key takeaways from today: And I know we covered a lot, but at the end of the day, you know, you need to get to terms of use in place. If you sell a digital product. You know, you need to require customers to agree to your terms of use before purchase. And, you know, to keep records of your terms of use.

[00:19:29.340] - Nicole
If you have no idea where to start. You can actually snag in terms of use template in my legal shop at NicoleCheriOden.com/legal shop. And please feel free to reach out if you have any questions, you can e-mail me at Nicolae@NicoleCheriOden.com Shrilled and I do manage my own email inbox.

[00:19:47.730] - Nicole
But please do remember well, I can point you toward the right resource. I can't give specific legal advice unless you've entered into the written and executed retainer agreement with my law firm. But only business is distinct from my practice. So that's why I say I can point you toward the right resource, but I can't give a specific legal advice. Thank you so much and I hope that you have an amazing rest of your day.

**Transcript:**
[00:00:13.310] - Nicole
Hey, welcome to Uncomplicating Contracts for Bloggers. My name is Nicole Cheri Odin. And I am an attorney licensed in the state of California. I have been licensed or ten years this year. I have my own virtual law firm, Nicole Cheri Odin Law PC, as well as an online business, Nicole Cheri Odin LLC, where I provide legal templates to other online business owners who are not necessarily ready to work with an attorney like me, one on one. But know that they need to get some basic contracts and legal policies in place for their online business.

[00:00:51.280] - Nicole
I'm married to my high school sweetheart, and we have an almost six year old little girl.

[00:00:58.390] - Nicole
So, now that you know a little bit about me, I'm going to kind of dive into all the goodness that we are going to cover today. And there are three main questions that we're going to answer. The first being, what is the contract? We're also going to chat about why written contracts are so important as a blogger or online business owner. And we're going to chat very briefly about some of the contracts that you might need in your online business.

[00:01:21.930] - Nicole
And even as a blogger. Before I launch in, though, know that everything I share is legal education and information. It's not business, financial or legal advice. It doesn't create an attorney client relationship between us, and you definitely want to chat with an attorney in your area to make sure that you're taking the right steps for you and your business. As a caveat, as I said at the beginning, I am licensed in the state of California, so everything that I share is going to be from the perspective of United States law.

[00:01:51.850] - Nicole
Alright. So our first question, what is a contract? So in the broadest sense, a contract really is an exchange of promises. So, one person promises to do something in exchange for something else from another person. And it's important to know that contracts really can be oral or written, and both can be legally enforceable.

[00:02:13.870] - Nicole
However, proving an oral contract in court can be a game of he said, she said. And to complicate things, each state actually has some different laws about what contracts should be in writing. This is called the statute of frauds. So, in my opinion, all written contracts connected to your business or your blog really should be in writing. It is one of the best investments that you can make into your business.

[00:02:42.020] - Nicole
And we're going to chat why, right now. You know, generally what a contract is. Why is it that contracts are so important, in particular, written contracts? So, the first reason really is it's protection for when something happens.

[00:02:58.660] - Nicole
Unfortunately, as a business owner, as a blogger even the question is not if something might happen, it is when whether that means you have a data breach. If you have a customer, perhaps for a digital product to ask for a refund, maybe you have somebody who disagrees with terms for an affiliate partnership. It really is the unglamorous side of being a business owner. But having a written contract in place is like an insurance policy. You can't put legal protections in place after the fact.

[00:03:28.410] - Nicole
It's an unfortunate reality. You can save yourself a lot of headache if you get the written contract in place in advance and deal with some of the what if scenarios. In that same vein of thinking, you're saving yourself time, money and a headache by having a contract in place ahead of time. Because you are minimizing your exposure for somebody bringing a claim against you. And having clearly written contracts really does limit your liability and protect you from undue risk, because you are dealing with some of those things in advance.

[00:04:05.310] - Nicole
So, like I said, you can't put legal protections in place after the fact, and it can become so much more expensive when you realize, oh, I need a Booboo or there's something that we need to clarify.

[00:04:17.010] - Nicole
So, you're now going back to clean up the issue and also putting things in place going forward. So, if you make the investment ahead of time and base these things head on and get your written contracts in place, you really are saving yourself time, money and the huge headache.

[00:04:34.690] - Nicole
One of the biggest reasons for having written contracts in place is to protect your income. And that is, even as a blogger, so, written contracts really do outline boundaries. They provide clear written expectations for your clients, for your customers, for your affiliate partners, for your business partners, whatever it may be. At the end of the day, we all like to go the extra mile for our clients, our customers, our readers. But having clearly drafted written terms that you can revert back to if an issue arises, which really is when, right.

[00:05:07.970] - Nicole
We talked about that can save you a lot of trouble, and it will protect your income in the long run by making sure that those boundaries are clearly expressed.

[00:05:20.230] - Nicole
And I think one of the biggest reasons for having a written contract in place, aside from protecting your boundaries, is really actually increasing what I like to call your street cred as an expert in your industry. So, if you think about your own experiences with other people in the online space, other entrepreneurs, perhaps ones that you admire, perhaps ones that you don't, especially, ones that you have actually purchased a product or service from. If they have their legal expectations, they're written contracts in place, you probably feel a lot better about the experience.

[00:05:53.090] - Nicole
And let me give you a tangible example of this. 

[00:05:55.320] - Nicole
So, let's say you are looking to hire a business strategist as you're launching your blog as you're adding digital products and you get a couple of referrals. You chat with one who simply sends you a PayPal link and says, here pay this and we'll get started. You chop another one who actually sits down and provides you with a clearly defined written contract that outlines all of the expectations, what you're going to pay? How many sessions you're paying for? Can you ask for a refund? Can you reschedule sessions?

[00:06:25.410] - Nicole
All of these things that you kno wmaybe you may not be thinking ahead of time as you're entering into the relationship, but questions could come up. You're probably going to feel more comfortable going with the business strategy who sent you that clearly written contract because all those expectations are outlined. So, when you have written contracts and policies in place, it actually improves your clients and customers experiences. It makes you look more professional. It makes you look more polished, more put together, and that in turn increases your street cred.

[00:06:54.800] - Nicole
As an expert in the industry, which really is priceless. And the fifth reason for having written contracts in place as a blogger, as an online business owner is really to boost your confidence. So it is human nature for us to take a huge side relief when we know something's been dealt with. And then we're able to turn and focus our attention on other parts of our business, you know such as launching a new course or collaborating or signing a new affiliate. You can actually translate this into an increase in profit and exposure for you and your business because you're not bogged down with these kind of what if legal scenarios.

[00:07:34.690] - Nicole
So we chatted about what a contract is.

[00:07:37.120] - Nicole
We chatted about five reasons why it really is important to have written contracts and legal protections in place for your online business in your blog. Now let's chat about some of the contracts to consider for your blog and your online business.

[00:07:51.970] - Nicole
The first and probably the one we're going to spend the most time on is a Privacy policy. So, if your website collects any personal information, you are actually legally required to have a Privacy policy. When I say personal information that includes the all elusive email address as we work to build our email list, but also things like first and last name, telephone number and really anything relating to a person's physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity, which is a super, super expansive definition and actually includes things like IP addresses.

[00:08:30.150] - Nicole
So on your website, all those tracking software and cookies that you probably have installed. Google Analytics, Facebook Pixel, Pinterest tag, all those fun things, those are collecting personal information.

[00:08:41.680] - Nicole
You are required to have a Privacy policy.

[00:08:46.690] - Nicole
That is because California was the first state to enact legislation, the California Online Privacy Protection Act, also known as COPPA in 2004, which makes it mandatory if a business is, doing business with a Californian resident. And here's, you know the crux of this is that we don't know where our website users and viewers are coming from. The reach of the interweb is global, which means you are more likely than not going to have a Californian resident interacting with your website. So, you're probably going to be collecting personal informaton.

[00:09:18.850] - Nicole
Hence, you need a Privacy policy.

[00:09:21.610] - Nicole
The California Consumer Privacy Act, or the CCPA was enacted in 2020, and it adds more expansive protections for consumers, which actually build on the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, which, if you are in the online space. I'm sure you've heard kicked around a time or two, which was enacted in May of 2018. And this actually makes it a requirement to have a Privacy policy if you process personal information for even one EU or UK resident. GDPR also requires affirmative consent from your website users before you can even process the personal information.

[00:09:59.120] - Nicole
And we're going to chat more about that in a minute. But this is the data Privacy kind of background behind why you need to make sure you're having a Privacy policy on your website. Because under this legislation, you have exposure for fines.

[00:10:17.620] - Nicole
Under Calaba, which was the original California legislation. It's $2,500 per violation, and each website visit is considered a violation. So, every time somebody pings on your website, you're collecting personal information. And there is not a Privacy policy, you have exposure $2,500 for violation. GDPR, which is a little bit later legislation sets sanctions at €20 million or 4% of the businesses worldwide revenue of the prior year, whichever is higher, which can be expansive as you're building your blog as you're building your online business.

[00:10:53.290] - Nicole
And CCPA, which was the most recent California legislation, has a range of sanctions between $2,500 to $7,500. And there's actually a right for consumer to bring a personal suit if you have a data breach that harms them. And this mirrors some of the language in GDPR, which also allows people to bring a private suit in the case of a data breach. So, you definitely want to be paying attention to this data Privacy legislation. The point of this chat is not to scare you.

[00:11:24.030] - Nicole
Really, if you take nothing else away, you want to make sure that you have a Privacy policy in place and know what you're doing with the personal information that you're collecting, because at the end of the day, that is what a Privacy policy is. It outlines what information you're collecting and what you do with it to consumers who are interacting on your website.

[00:11:44.650] - Nicole
Taking this a step further. So, I mentioned earlier that GDPR actually requires your website users to affirmatively agree to process their personal information. And the word process actually encompasses a lot of things from storing, recording, retrieving, sharing, so, really, anything that you are doing with people's, email addresses, names, date of birth, whatever it may be, you're processing personal information. And if you think back to all of the websites you've visited since 2018, I'm sure you've seen a cookie pop up a time or two, and it's not the cookies that you eat.

[00:12:18.280] - Nicole
It really is a little banner that pops up and says, yes, I agree to the cookies on this website. And that is because as I mentioned, those third party cookies and trackers on your website like Google Analytics, Pinterest Tag, Facebook, Pixel.

[00:12:30.820] - Nicole
All those things are collecting data from people who are interacting on your website and they have to be giving their consent to you in order for you to collect that. It is required before you can even start the collection process. So, again, if you take nothing else away from today's chat. As a blogger, you definitely need to be cognizant of data Privacy legislation. You need to understand its implications in the online space and that you need a Privacy policy. You need to be using a cookie consent pop up because all of those lovely trackers, beacons, and third party cookies cannot be activated until you have your website users consent. And you want to make sure you have an understanding of what you're doing with the information that you're collecting to begin with.

[00:13:18.370] - Nicole
So, I know that was a lot in terms of Privacy policies and data Privacy legislation, but let's chat a little bit about terms and conditions for your website. So, these are also known as terms of service, and they really are the ground rules for what your website users can and can't do with your website. They outline things like limitations of liability and disclaimers, which we're going to chat about in a minute, how and where disputes are going to be handled if one arises, third party and affiliate links, which we're also going to chat about in a minute.

[00:13:47.410] - Nicole
Interestingly enough, unlike the Privacy policy, they are not legally required, but there's a, but they are the first place a court will look to if you have a dispute with somebody who uses your website.

[00:14:00.430] - Nicole
So, having terms and conditions in place for your website really is kind of a gold star business practice. And much like the Privacy policy where you are actually supposed to obtain affirmative consent from website users to agree to the collection of personal information. And that really does require them to perhaps check a box, click a button in terms of that cookie pop up and at the point of collection on your website. I actually encourage online business owners and bloggers to link their terms and conditions as they link their privacy policies.

[00:14:34.960] - Nicole
This is known as a quick wrap in internet law. This is better than just sticking them in the footer of your website because it actually creates an affordable contract. So, you have a better chance of showing that they were aware of terms for your website and at least understood them because they went through the motions of clicking.

[00:14:53.320] - Nicole
I agree, before they're able to even interact with your website or the content on your website, whatever it may be. Disclaimers, I always, always, always, say you should be including those in your terms and conditions. Disclaimers really do, at the end of the day, deny responsibility. They tell your blog, your website users, your blog readers that the information you're sharing is informational and educational. And this is especially important if you are blogging or sharing content about a regulated industry. So, think the food industry, medicine, finances, health, even the legal industry.

[00:15:32.310] - Nicole
I mean, I gave a disclaimer at the beginning of the presentation. You'll see that on people's websites, they may have a separate footer for disclaimers outside of the terms and conditions. They may even have the disclaimers posted multiple places near content on their website. Disclaim, disclaim, disclaim. I am an attorney, so.

[00:15:51.780] - Nicole
Obviously, that's kind of my posture in terms of making sure that you are protected. But having your disclaimers incorporated in your terms and conditions and having your website users agree to those terms and conditions affirmatively before they're interacting with your content again goes a long way of creating an enforceable contract versus merely just sticking the disclaimer on the footer and never dealing with it. It helps them in your exposure. So, just a little friendly tip today. A particular disclaimer that I wanted to chat about today is the affiliate disclaimer.

[00:16:26.270] - Nicole
So, if you are sharing affiliate links on your blog or in your content i.e. you are receiving a commission anytime anybody uses that link, you have to disclose that to your website users. And your disclosure has to say that you're an affiliate and you receive a commission if they use that link. I always say you should also include your affiliate disclaimers in your terms and conditions. Again, if they're affirmatively agreeing to the terms and conditions, you have a better chance of showing you have an enforceable contract, but you should also be including it in any blog post or any content that you share your affiliate link in.

[00:17:02.610] - Nicole
This is because the Federal Trade Commission or the FTC actually plays a huge role in affiliate marketing.

[00:17:08.710] - Nicole
They're protecting consumers just like you and me from false and misleading advertising. We are bombarded on a daily basis with recommendations in the online space. And so, the FTC really does lease these things to make sure that you're marketing in a legit way in a legit manner. And it's not sneaky in terms of getting people to click on things and receiving a commission by recommending products you maybe don't stand behind, but you're trying to get the affiliate commission. So, don't think that you can ignore this piece.

[00:17:40.750] - Nicole
You definitely want to make sure that you are very clear and very prominent if you have affiliate links that are being used in your blog post and in your content.

[00:17:48.650] - Nicole
Alright. So, we chatted about the ever important Privacy policy. We chatted about terms and conditions or terms of service for your website. I also want to mention terms of use because so many bloggers have an online business with their blog, and that could be by selling downloadable products like digital products such as my legal templates. It could be offering ecourses.

[00:18:08.170] - Nicole
It could be offering a membership, some sort of digital products. You want to make sure you have terms of use in place for your customers or clients to agree to prior to purchasing. These are very similar to terms and conditions in that they outline the rules of the road for how people can use your products. So, they are going to contain those ever important provisions such as your payment policy, your refund policy. Again, if a dispute arises, are you going to court? Are you mediating?

[00:18:34.850] - Nicole
Are you arbitrary? Whatever it may be, that dispute resolution language is in there, they are key if you are selling digital products. And you definitely want to make sure that in the checkout process, you're having your customers agree to both your privacy policy and your terms of use prior to putting in their purchase information, again, recreating, enforceable contracts. And make sure that they are checking a box or pushing a button that says I have read and I agree to the Privacy policy to the terms and conditions and keep records.

[00:19:09.150] - Nicole
That is one thing I cannot stress enough, especially for newer business owners.

[00:19:14.480] - Nicole
A lot of times people will think that everything is just kind of contained within the website. Make sure that you are actively taking steps to create some other form of written record somewhere in case something happens with the website. So, you can go back and you know support that somebody actually did click a button in order to be able to proceed to the next stage to make the purchase.

[00:19:40.230] - Nicole
So, with terms of use, one other tip that I want to get before I move on to guest blog post release is, it's actually very beneficial as part of keeping records to actually create a screenshot video of yourself going through the checkout process, and update that any time your checkout process updates. But actually showing what it looks like to make a purchase from your online store from selecting it, putting in the cart, going to the checkout page, having to click that I've read and agree to buttons, maybe try it without clicking them and have the error message pop up that shows it.

[00:20:12.340] - Nicole
Then click the buttons and then proceed and keep the MP4 file, or however, it is that you save that video somewhere with the proof of your clients purchases. It's just a great thing for you to have in your tool bag in case you does come up with a potential or past client or customer down the line.

[00:20:32.000] - Nicole
You can revisit that and show that look, it really is required to agree to these terms prior to purchase. So, you click them and you agreed and this is kind of what's going to apply in how we deal with the issue. Alright, moving on to Guest blog post release. So, if you are going to have guest bloggers on your blog, you definitely want to make sure you're having them execute a guest blog post release. And that is because that blog post that your guest blogger is creating is actually their copyrighted material.

[00:20:59.970] - Nicole
So, under copyright law, you are granted legal protection for what's called an original work of authorship fixed in any tangible medium of expression, which basically means at the time that you actually create something, aka you type that blog post, aka, you take the photo for the blog, whatever it may be. The Copyright attached at that moment of creation. And so, in order for you to then have permission to use that copyrighted material, enter the guest blog post release that gives you the license to use their post, and it also outlines those expectations in terms of are they being compensated for use of that post.

[00:21:40.450] - Nicole
Do you have the right to edit their post? Do you have the ability to potentially just decide that you don't want to post it at all? Are they providing images?

[00:21:47.990] - Nicole
And if so, do they have the copyright permissions for the images that you're sharing? All those types of expectations are clearly outlined, and it's definitely something. Again, you want to keep records of in case you do have a copyright and version of claim come up down the line, which is beyond the scope of what we're chatting about today. But really, it is a great projection to have this release in place. So, just a quick reminder.

[00:22:11.110] - Nicole
This is not an exhaustive list of contracts that you will need as a blogger or in your online business. But if you have a privacy policy, you have terms and conditions for your website. You have terms of use in place for any digital products that you sell, and you're using affiliate disclaimers and disclaimers in general, as well as a guest blog post release if you have guest bloggers. You're well on your way and you can definitely chat with an attorney in your area to make sure that you're using the contracts that you need in your online business.

[00:22:38.790] - Nicole

**Transcript:**
[00:00:00.000] - Liz Stapleton
Thank you so much for joining me for the session with Sam from the 5 Minute Lawyer. He is obviously a lawyer, as am I. We go back a long ways actually. I'm really excited for him to be sharing his knowledge because he's been doing law stuff for creative entrepreneurs for years. He's based in California. Sam, welcome. Thank you so much for taking the time.

[00:00:22.560] - Sam Mazzeo
Thank you. Yeah, glad to be here. Definitely looking forward to talking all the topics that creatives and freelancers and bloggers and folks tend to get confused and pretty scared about.

[00:00:32.600] - Liz Stapleton
Yeah. And we do just want to quickly say a disclaimer, guys. This is not legal advice. This is informational, help you wrap your brain around what stuff is what. There's a lot of sometimes fancy terms and jargon out there. So hopefully this will help you better understand it, but it's not telling you what you should do. So just informational purposes only cover both our bases.

[00:00:55.520] - Sam Mazzeo
Right. Definitely not specific to your circumstances. And so very high level just informational. Definitely, consult an attorney if anything that we say sounds like it's important to you or scares you or is relevant. So yeah, definitely, information.

[00:01:09.720] - Liz Stapleton
And in your jurisdiction, because you're based in California, a lot of people on here might not be, I'm currently in Washington. We're not licensed in Washington, other states.

[00:01:17.490] - Sam Mazzeo
Right.

[00:01:18.220] - Liz Stapleton
Between the two of us, there's what, three states of licensure? And they're 50.

[00:01:23.760] - Sam Mazzeo
Right.

[00:01:25.040] - Liz Stapleton
Chances are we're not licensed where you live. Okay, so let's go ahead and dive in. So when people start a blog, they think it's all just like writing or whatnot, and then they get further into it and they may realize once they start making money that they might want to form a corporation of some sort or LLC, just limited liability corporation. When do you think is best... I know there's an accounting side to that question, but the legal side to that question, when do you think it's best for people to perhaps look at forming a corporation for an online business?

[00:01:55.450] - Sam Mazzeo
Yeah, it's a great question. It's always one of the early stage questions. I would say that yes to your point, I always like to say that it's a lot easier to fit the legal strategy to the tax strategy rather than trying to do it the other way around. I would say confirm whatever we recommend with a CPA. But generally speaking, LLC and corporation are going to provide the same type of liability protection, assuming that you observe your corporate formalities, which is things like your filings with the state, paying your taxes, separate bank accounts, your internal paperwork, all those types of things. But really what it comes down to with an LLC versus corporation is, LLCs are more simple. They're a little bit less expensive. And when I say more simple, it's that it's a little bit of an easier decision making and governance structure. Corporations have shareholders. They appoint the board. The board makes decisions and instructs the officers who instruct the staff and the employees, where in an LLC, you have members and the members can be the managers. And they're all one, not separate body that makes decisions. And so it's a lot easier.

[00:02:57.610] - Sam Mazzeo
And then that's a long way of getting to when you should form an LLC or a corporation, but we're lawyers, we're long winded. I would always say that the sooner, the better. But it really comes down to the ROI that you get that up, the return on your investment of all the filing fees and then you'll probably have some ongoing taxes and fees once you have an entity like an LLC or a corporation established. If the revenue is there and those expenses don't seem significant, then I would say do it because it's always good to have that liability protection in place.

[00:03:29.980] - Liz Stapleton
Yeah, because it's protecting someone who wants to go after your business from going after your house, for example.

[00:03:35.190] - Sam Mazzeo
Right. So just explain that.

[00:03:37.380] - Liz Stapleton
Yeah. And you can have, especially bloggers, start out most often as a company of one. It's just them. And so a single member LLC, which varies by state because they are state mandated. It's probably not the right word. And by cost, too, because I don't know what an LLC filing in California is, but I know in Massachusetts it's $500, and Arizona it's $30, right? What that ROI is going to look like is going to depend on where you're at, too.

[00:04:03.720] - Sam Mazzeo
Yeah, and it's only $70 in California. But it's also worth mentioning, too, that with an LLC and especially a single member LLC, there are some tax advantages typically that you can take advantage of there by filing what's called an SCORP election, which by the way, SCORP is an election, not an actual state authorized entity. You can always think of your state entity and your tax status as two separate things, and sometimes they overlap.

[00:04:28.440] - Liz Stapleton
Yeah, and that's where you're getting into tax is talk to CPA. I spent eight hours in QuickBooks yesterday, and I was like, I do not like this.

[00:04:37.030] - Sam Mazzeo
I know enough to be dangerous, but I'm not a CPA. Exactly.

[00:04:41.090] - Liz Stapleton
And then a lot of times, too, we started a blog... Because I know my first website started out under a completely different name, and I didn't register for as an LLC, so it wasn't as big of an issue when I rebranded to a new name. But DBAs are doing business as... Can you break down what those are, when you would use one, how to go about what people should know about DBAs?

[00:05:03.670] - Sam Mazzeo
Sure. Yeah. So because California likes to be different, we call them fictitious business names, but they are the same thing.

[00:05:09.420] - Liz Stapleton
I think they sound wrong.

[00:05:11.270] - Sam Mazzeo
Right. I know. And so the the DBA, I think of that as like a vanity plate on your car. It is something that identifies you. It is a name, but that's where it stops. It really is something that is only for if you want to have an outwardly facing name that maybe isn't the same as your LLC or your corporation. I could name my LLC, five minute lawyer, and then have Sam Mazzeo as my brand, which obviously it's the other way around. But that could be how you do that. And so DBAs really don't provide you any protection other than the fact that they obscure the actual company behind them. And so in a situation where maybe you're doing something where you don't want it to be easy for the public to figure out who you are for any given reason. I've had clients that have- You're.

[00:05:56.930] - Liz Stapleton
Blogging or something.

[00:05:58.340] - Sam Mazzeo
Yeah, anonymous blogging, journalism type things, sometimes that can be helpful. It's really hard to totally obscure who the owner of a company is, but it's one step further with the DBA. I've had clients that have restraining orders due to past relationships and things where they just don't want their name out there. That's one thing they can be helpful for. But at the end of the day, it really is just a nickname. A better example than the one I gave is my name is Samuel, but I can go by Sam. Sam would be my DBA. Samuel would be the LLC name. And the weird thing with DBAs is that they're by county, too. So when you file for a DBA in your home county, technically, you're supposed to have a DBA in every county that you do business. That's not very realistic, and no one does that. But once you have it in your home county, you can use that DBA outwardly facing. But again, it's just a nickname, not any type of protective measure.

[00:06:48.880] - Liz Stapleton
Yeah. And then, so one thing I know you are very eligible of, especially being in California, is a lot of bloggers to start making money on their site so they can focus on it more. They pick up freelancing, sometimes transfer design. And California came out with an independent contractor rule change that is putting a lot of people in a panic. And I know a lot of freelancers that are like, companies based in California are just not going to work with them anymore. What insight can you provide on that?

[00:07:17.350] - Sam Mazzeo
Yeah. So it's definitely a lot. There's a lot of history behind it. And I think it's always worth starting with the fact that we actually help employers get proper benefits set up and employee performance management and all of their worker rights that we think are very important. So we do that proactively for employers. We also work with a lot of contractors and freelancers out there. And so this bill in particular, it seeks to help people with better worker rights and benefits, but it's really poorly drafted in our opinion and is making a mess of an economy that was already turning along and doing really well with independent contractors and freelancers. Because a lot of what we find is that people would prefer to be a contractor when they're a highly skilled freelancer or blogger or anything that is now at this point, usually going to be a contractor. This new rule really did a few things. One is that it removed the old test for who can properly be classified as independent contractor. The old test was 8-11 factors, and the whole goal was to be on the independent side of as many of those factors as you could.

[00:08:24.330] - Sam Mazzeo
If it was the majority of the factors, weight independent, great, that's an independent contractor. If not, employee. Now it's a three factor test called an ABC test, and the three factors are much more stringent. I'll get to in a second why this is even more confusing because there's now multiple layers. But the ABC test is what you'll look at first. And so the ABC test, the first one, A, is how much control you have over that contractor's work. Is it butts in seats, nine to five? You're governing all their tasks? If so, that definitely weighs in favor of employee. If independent judgment, they have on creative license, they're out doing it whenever and don't really have deadlines or loose deadlines, you're not requiring them to wear a uniform or certain things like that, that's going to be more independent. Now, the second factor, the most difficult factor to satisfy is whether or not what they do is substantially related to what your business does. Now, this one is difficult because really what it comes down to is looking at that person, whoever you're engaging to do that contractor work, will your business make money without them?

[00:09:28.350] - Sam Mazzeo
And you can get into some of the really blurry arguments on that, like you can't make money if you don't have a social media marketing person, but that's not what your business does. Whereas if you are a content creation company and you independently contract all of your content writing, that is substantially related to the core of your business, and they most likely need to be an employee. And then the third factor is really just whether or not whoever you're engaging this contractor does this independently. So it's whether or not that's an independently established trade and that they have other clients that they do this for. Now, the last thing that I'll say on this for the initial long feel that I'm giving is that with AB5, the unfortunate thing that I think occurred is that a lot of people lobbied for specific types of exemptions. What that ended up creating is there's a few exemptions that will expire over the next few years. That's confusing in and of itself, because if you're under that one, you have a pass, but then you have to deal with it later, kicking the can down the road. But then also what's really difficult is that if you're a specific type of skill, so let's say you're a graphic designer, graphic designers have their own specific exemption.

[00:10:39.010] - Sam Mazzeo
If you're a graphic designer, we're not going through the ABC test and we have our own multifactor test that isn't related to the old test and it's just this new made up test. Same goes for things like grant writers, certain professionals like lawyers. There's just a number now of different analyzes that are required, and they're all really dependent on what you do.

[00:11:00.220] - Liz Stapleton
Got you. I know in the Freelance writing world, because this is where I've heard this the most because I use to Freelance, is the limit of if you do more than 30 pieces of content or 30 something, there's some confusion as to what constitutes a piece.

[00:11:17.120] - Sam Mazzeo
That typically applies to photographers. Sorry to interrupt you. And then it applies to a few other... But yeah, so that's a great thing to bring up because it's so specific to what it is the contractor is doing.

[00:11:29.050] - Liz Stapleton
Okay. So it is varied by what freelance services you're offering. And if the company isn't based in California, it's not an issue. You're not based in California.

[00:11:38.070] - Sam Mazzeo
Yet to be seen. Because the way that I back into some of these questions is that there's a few motivations for this bill. The outward facing one is the feather in the Congresswoman's cap that says, Hey, I'm working for rights of workers. But I think it is twofold. One is that they lost the lawsuit against Uber and they want something that they can still stick it to them. And then more importantly and relatedly is that taxes. Independent contractors are notorious for not reporting and paying their taxes. And so that ends up being... We looked at a study and it was like something over the last 10 years, it was in the $45 million or something like that and lost tax revenue. And so the state wants that money. And so to that point, if the company is based in California, the compliance is for sure required because they'd be holding and reporting the taxes. And then if they're an out of state contractor or out of state company, it's hard to tell because that still touches California's tax scheme. So we don't know yet.

[00:12:39.540] - Liz Stapleton
It's going to be a wait to see what shakes out in court.

[00:12:43.470] - Sam Mazzeo
Right. When they go knock on Uber's door and say, hey, you guys have a lot of improperly classified contractors, and we're going to take this all the way up to the California Supreme Court and sort some of this stuff out. Yeah.

[00:12:53.750] - Liz Stapleton
Okay. No, so that's super helpful. And I think good people to know. Now I know when I started... Or when I first started my LLC, I got so much mail of things telling me, Oh, you need to get this sign and pay all this money. And it was a lot of BS, but I knew enough that to tell it was BS. But what things should people look out for is real mail they need to deal with once they've registered a business and what they can ignore because you get so much stuff that looks really official.

[00:13:24.300] - Sam Mazzeo
So.

[00:13:24.760] - Liz Stapleton
What? It's not, though. And it's really you're like, How is this legal? I'm not allowed. But Yeah.

[00:13:30.490] - Sam Mazzeo
Yeah. It's tough, too, because sometimes and actually, often those not official notices are related to official rules that you do have to follow. Yeah. So what I always say is that every single one of those notices, the only regulation on this type of spam, scammy stuff is that it does have to say that it's not from a government office. Somewhere in there, it'll be buried in the rest of the text. It should be bolded, but somewhere in there, it'll say this notice or this letter has not been approved by a government authority or government agency. That should be your dead giveaway right there. But the problem, like I said, is that sometimes it'll say, hey, you need to spend $200 on this labor notices poster and put it up in your workplace. It is true. If you have employees in the workplace, you do have to have that poster up.

[00:14:17.930] - Liz Stapleton
You're a company of one and you work at home and you're a computer and you can get the notice for free from the government.

[00:14:25.350] - Sam Mazzeo
Well, or for like 30 bucks, you can get a whole laminated, really official and one on Amazon or whatever. Then this goes for trademarks, too. Trademark applications get notices all the time saying, Hey, someone registered your trademark in China, but you can fight it. It's just a lot of this stuff, for the most part, with our clients, we tell them you're only going to receive stuff from us or stuff that we tell you to look out for. And so that usually is helpful. But really, it's like looking for that notice on there. And then if that's not on there, sometimes you can actually just google the name of whatever reached out to you and say, Is this a scam? And the California Secretary of State has an entire page dedicated to scam notices. And so sometimes you can actually find stuff out there. I do the same thing when I get phone calls for numbers I don't know. I google it, and sometimes you can see that it's a scam. So not a great answer.

[00:15:17.550] - Liz Stapleton
But- No, but I think that gives people... Because you take for granted the legal knowledge you have sometimes you get all this. And someone who's maybe their stay at home mom starting a blog, you know, that didn't work in any legal environment or have that whatever job they had before, they don't know and it just can be scary.

[00:15:41.120] - Sam Mazzeo
I've had people that worked in... They had their series license and they were an investment broker and they started their first company with us and they got notices and just paid it. It happens to everyone because they look so official. They have little fakes.

[00:15:55.910] - Liz Stapleton
I remember getting something. I was like, This is really good, but it's not... Another piece of mail it's scary to get, whether it's an email or online, is a cease and desist letter. Sometimes you may need to send. What should you do if you get one and when it would be the right circumstance that you would want to have one drafted and sent?

[00:16:19.020] - Sam Mazzeo
Yeah. I would say the first thing to do when you get one is take a deep breath and realize that typically these are the first shot over the bow and they're not always going to be as scary as the letter says. Of course, the situation is very dependent on what the actual infringement alleges and what's going on because there are some things that can be really significant. But every cease and desist letter I've ever seen has usually a time period on it. And then even if you pass that time period, there's a period of time where as long as you start a communication with that party, that there's going to be some leeway on trying to comply or negotiate something else with them.

[00:16:58.430] - Liz Stapleton
No one wants to have to pay to go to court. It's far more expensive.

[00:17:01.480] - Sam Mazzeo
Right. And that's exactly where I was going to go next. Typically, no one just runs out and files a complaint in court, especially since what we're talking about here, typically with the blogging community is going to be like infringement and intellectual property. And with those types of cease and desist, infringement lawsuits are actually a totally different thing. They're a federal thing. They're more expensive. They take a long time, very specialized. And so a lot of the time, the cease and desist is more of a blurb. And depending on how deep the pockets of who it came from, it can be a blurb. But it's important to just take a breath. Usually, I would say try to get in touch with an attorney because they're going to be able to help you sort through that. But if you're running up against the deadline, reach out and just let them know that you've received it, you're taking it seriously. You want to know your rights, you're speaking to a lawyer, and then at least push out that timeline. And then one of the things that's usually the subject of a cease and desist is like trademark infringement.

[00:17:53.980] - Sam Mazzeo
And with that, it's always good to do trademark searches on the front end when you come up with your name so that you know, and then have some backup names if possible, in the roster, because rebranding sucks, but it's better than going through a multiyear federal infringement lawsuit, too.

[00:18:10.920] - Liz Stapleton
Yeah. And then.

[00:18:11.860] - Sam Mazzeo
To the other question of when is it good to send a cease and desist? So I'm really of the mindset that a rising tide lifts all ships and we can all work together. There's enough of the pie out there for everyone. So I always recommend if you see something that you think is infringing on your intellectual property, first, be sure that it is, because a lot of the time I get questions that are like, That logo looks like mine, or That name is just like mine. It might be, but it might be for a product or service that's totally unrelated to what you're doing, and then it's not trademark infringement, usually. There's that and then the different types of classes of services and products. Then in addition to that, copyright and trademark are very nuanced. Even though it may look identical, it may be very similar. There's just a lot of details that go into whether or not it can actually be actionable infringement, including what your status is, what your footing is, whether or not you have registrations in these things, stuff like that. Then in addition to that, things like copyright, I've dealt with copyright in fashion and different articles of clothing.

[00:19:14.690] - Sam Mazzeo
One of the problems there is that trying to get registered with a copyright or trying to fight and send a cease and desist is a many-month process. By the time you sort that all out, the fashion may have changed and you may not care about that design anymore. I typically recommend reach out first. Well, if you are sure it's infringement, reach out first super informally, Facebook messages, emails, however you can contact the people and just say, give them the benefit of the doubt and say, maybe you don't know about us, but that's our trademark. That's our copyright. We really appreciate it if you take that down. You can say, hey, just sell off the rest of the inventory to be copesthetic and then take it down. And the reason I say reach out that way first is that you'll see how they're going to react. You'll see if they lawyer up. Frankly, you can always be a dick later. So reach out nice first.

[00:20:04.190] - Liz Stapleton
Yeah. Start with an olive branch before you... I'd say the one exception I feel like that is in the instance of, because I've seen it happen, someone completely copies word for word, graphic for graphic your entire site. I'd say do not engage. Just file the takedown notice with Google and with their host. Do not engage in that instance.

[00:20:25.000] - Sam Mazzeo
Yeah. And that's a good recommendation, too, is the DMCA takedown notice. Every single site in the world should and the big ones will, like GoDaddy and the different hosting and things like that, will have in their privacy policy or their terms of service, an infringement reporting mechanism and process where you click a link, you fill out some information, send it off. In that process, it'll automatically take down the infringing content. But the people that have the infringing content can appeal it. And once they appeal it, then whoever that host was has already done their responsibility. They're off the hook at that point. The reason they take it down automatically is they're on the hook if they don't. But once the other person appeals and then it's between the parties, the host or the platform will be hands off because they've done their legal responsibility. So it's not always a silver bullet, but it typically will work and it shows the other party that you're serious. And then if it goes back up, you can reach out to them with your more formal cease and desist or your lawyer letter or whatever the.

[00:21:22.200] - Liz Stapleton
Case is. Yeah. And I mean, if it's just like a paragraph... But I've seen entire website's copy, and that's a dumb gage. Those people are-.

[00:21:29.880] - Sam Mazzeo
You're taking pictures of staff, I've seen. And it's like, what? Yeah.

[00:21:34.580] - Liz Stapleton
Yeah. That's really bad. But yeah, but I've gotten cease and desist or someone was like, actually, I don't want to say cease and desist, but just a request of, Hey, we'd really rather you didn't link to this page. I'm like, okay, I'll go find a different page that works better. Sometimes if it's something like that and it's not a big deal and you don't want to hold strong in it, it's okay. Okay, done. Bye.

[00:21:58.610] - Sam Mazzeo
Totally. I always tell people, anytime you get into an adversarial conversation, the things you want to think about are what's the best case scenario for you? And so this applies to when you're sending a cease and desist or when you receive one. What's the best case scenario? And then what's the worst case scenario you're willing to accept? You'll probably fall somewhere in between those two. Yeah.

[00:22:16.550] - Liz Stapleton
But yeah, I like your advice of when you get one, just take deep breaths, read through it as calmly as possible, see what the deadline is, if it's something you really want to stick up for, and then take your time with it and just have a conversation because that will extend things out. It's not going to go zero to lawsuit.

[00:22:34.070] - Sam Mazzeo
Right. And lawyers are meant to be fire and brimstone most of the time. So when you get that letter, it's going to be very inflammatory and very blamey and very... It's going to be way over the top because most people are going to get that comply and then go a different way because it scared them. And so- The scared tack. -lawyers know that. Yeah, and that's part of the strategy. Yeah.

[00:22:57.720] - Liz Stapleton
So don't rush in the anything when it comes to those. And then we've touched on a lot. I'm trying to think what else I want to cover with you. Because you have worked with a lot of creative entrepreneurs, what are some mistakes you've seen them make that you've then had to help them fix or that maybe people watching could avoid?

[00:23:23.160] - Sam Mazzeo
Yeah. Man, there's a lot.

[00:23:25.520] - Liz Stapleton
Maybe ones that have been in common, not this. Yeah.

[00:23:29.030] - Sam Mazzeo
So I think using images online, that's a big one. I think people tend to just do a Google image search, grab a couple of images and throw it up on their website or in their blog. And that's definitely going to be a no, no. That's why there's so many of these stock image websites out there now. And I would say definitely use those instead or take your own photos. That's a big one that I see happen.

[00:23:52.200] - Liz Stapleton
Pay attention to the licensing on those stock websites, too, because some don't allow them for the situation you want to use them for. So just make sure you pay attention to licensing being granted.

[00:24:01.470] - Sam Mazzeo
Right. Yeah, the five-minute lawyer that you mentioned at the outset. So five-minute lawyer is my own little passion project that just costs me lots of money. But my law firm, too, we have images that we have to use, and we've tried to create our own stock images by just taking photos of stuff in our office. And with the five-minute lawyer, I had to find one of those stock websites. And it was like, yeah, oh, there's multiple layers of licenses. And so yeah, I think images is a big one. One thing that I've seen out there that might not be relevant totally here is music. Music is actually highly regulated as far as what you can play publicly. And music has usually two different licensing bodies, the actual performance license and also then the underlying actual composition license. So that's a whole can of worms.

[00:24:43.740] - Liz Stapleton
Yeah. No, I feel like there's, from my understanding, wrong rumor that if you only played 30 seconds of it, you're fine, which is not true.

[00:24:53.530] - Sam Mazzeo
Yeah. Any of the like, Oh, I only use a little bit of it, things, those typically are not going to hold up. However, occasionally you can use that argument as part of a larger argument of their use, but that's a whole can of worms. And then-.

[00:25:09.660] - Liz Stapleton
Sorry, I just want to mention real quick on the images front. People will do a round up post and grab images from the site that they're linking to you thinking it's okay. But unless they've given you that permission, it's not.

[00:25:21.080] - Sam Mazzeo
Attribution is not a in lieu of license. It has to be the permission. Even if you attribute it to someone, great, that gives them traffic, but it also tells them that you're using whatever it is. And then I guess another one that I think sometimes we have to dispel the myth of is just generally speaking, we touched on it a little bit earlier, like the name of whatever it is you have out there. By grabbing a domain, it doesn't necessarily mean that you then lock that name down. Having the domain, having even the business name doesn't necessarily mean that you've locked that name down because trademark exists independently of these two things that I already mentioned. You could presumably get a domain name, get an LLC name all in your state, and then realize that someone already has that trademark for whatever it is you're doing. That's just the nature of the beast because even within a state, a corporation and an LLC can have the same name because they're two independent approval bodies. And so, yeah, it's something that we dispel the time I get people. I had a call once with a client that they got pretty heated because they're like, I have the LLC Name.

[00:26:31.460] - Sam Mazzeo
I have the domain name. That's my name. And it's like, it's your name maybe. And just here in California, people may have that business name in other states. And if it's trademarked, it's not yours. And so that's one... And unfortunately, having the business name in the domain does not support your effort to get a trademark either. So it's tough because they relate, but they're separate. And so I think that's one that's relevant for people to know.

[00:26:55.860] - Liz Stapleton
Yeah. No, absolutely. I think that's a really good point of names because people just dive. I've seen the threads and Facebook groups of bloggers being like, I don't understand. I got this cease and desist. I use trademark because I named it this. And it's literally in the exact category trademark. And you're like, yeah, you really can't call it that.

[00:27:15.270] - Sam Mazzeo
The only options there is if you want to try to be... If you want to open a line of communication to whoever sent the letter and see if maybe they're interested in some type of collaboration or license or royalties or whatever.

[00:27:27.500] - Liz Stapleton
But yeah- And before you settle on a name, if you someone with a similar one, you could always reach out. I've actually seen that, too. There's a brewery up in New Hampshire that started brewery that their name was going to be similar to this other brewery. And they're like, Hey, we don't want to step on any toes. Is it going to be okay if we call ourselves this? They're like, Yeah, go for it. So you never know.

[00:27:49.600] - Sam Mazzeo
Yeah, totally. And I recommend that sometimes it's delicate because if they do care, you've tipped them off.

[00:27:56.800] - Liz Stapleton
And the same.

[00:27:59.460] - Sam Mazzeo
Yeah, right? Well, yeah. It's the whole better to know talent.

[00:28:02.650] - Liz Stapleton
Yeah.

[00:28:03.630] - Sam Mazzeo
And there's also sometimes we actually don't recommend if someone is totally married to their name and we run a trademark search and it doesn't look like it's likely to get registered, but the names are only somewhat similar. Sometimes we say then, look, if you're comfortable rolling the dice, we think these are different enough than if someone noticed they wouldn't care, but we don't think you get the registration. And by filing a registration, if they monitor it, then they're tipped off and they will come after you. So it's always do they notice you and do they care if there are similar names out there.

[00:28:33.010] - Liz Stapleton
Yeah. No, that's a great point, especially in terms of blogging, because I've seen people just added the to their name or something, and it's ridiculous in that case. Yeah. And so then the other thing I want to just touch on quickly is, and we won't dive too deep because they're very complicated, but there are laws that impact you even if you're in Kansas or something. So there's GDPR, which came out in 2018, which caused a huge splash. And everyone, I'm sure, remembers even if they weren't blogging then getting a ton of emails from every company on Earth saying, Hey, we've updated everything. Do you consent? And then CCPA, so the California Consumer Privacy Act? Yes, something like that? Yeah. So this is going to air in February 2020, and that goes into effect January first, 2020. So hopefully the dilution of emails will have mostly passed by now. But if you haven't done it yet, you should be aware that there are certain laws out there you need to comply with. You want to touch on those a little bit, maybe some concerns you've heard from clients regarding those, just so people can be aware.

[00:29:39.650] - Sam Mazzeo
A little bit. Yeah. So I would actually expect another dilution of emails in the new year because I think that the emails and the new compliance that is going to get captured by the CCPA is the companies that are in California but don't have a global reach because GDPR applies specifically to anybody that advertised or solicited to EU residents. Now CCPA will be California specific. If you're based in or touch California, CCPA is relevant and applicable to you. It is very similar to GDPR in the sense that from a high level, really what it means is, do you have permission from your consumers to have their information, which is why we got all those updated cookies and policy emails? Because that's step one, is that the consumer needs to understand that they are giving you their information and what you're going to do with it. And so that's an important piece is that your privacy policy in terms of service on your website need to be very, very clear. And so we actually try to work with our clients' developers on this stuff when we help with website policies because they know better. And then really what it comes down to as far as the consumer knowing what's going on with their data and their privacy is that they need to know whether or not you sell or use this information and monetize it in any way.

[00:30:55.190] - Sam Mazzeo
And if you do, there's a whole bunch of other stuff that's relevant that's too much to get into here like you mentioned. But the big overarching thing is that you need permission. They need to be aware of how you use their information. And if you monetize it, there needs to be a mechanism for them to reach out and request deletion of their information and data. And that comes along with its own authentication issues, authentication issues, because you have to make sure that whoever is reaching out is them. And then by trying to authenticate whoever is reaching out to you, you also need to ask for sensitive information. And so there's like a CCPA and the CCPA there. And then also in California to just tie a bow on this, the attorney general jumped in and added supplemental regulations and requirements to the CCPA. And so there's a little bit of a back and forth there that's going to make some uncertainty arise. But for the most part, yeah, I think it's just important to make sure that in the event that you use anybody's information, and even if you collect it, that you're just mindful of these rules and get in touch with somebody that can help you sort it out.

[00:31:58.260] - Liz Stapleton
Yeah. I think it comes down to business as being open and transparent with people for bloggers, readers, subscribers about what you're doing. And you may not realize that you are collecting information, but if you use something like Google Analytics or you have an email list, well, people are giving you their email address, you're collecting information. It's pretty much every blogger is going to be collecting some information on their site. So just keep that in mind. And I'm sure I'll do another session during the Summit that dives a little bit deeper on that topic. But especially since Sam was in California, I wanted to get his two cents with CCPA because it is new. Is there anything else you think would be helpful for bloggers, online business owners to be aware of on the legal side of things?

[00:32:45.670] - Sam Mazzeo
Yeah, I'd say there's probably two other things that I would mention. One of them is going to be, and this is just something that's a general recommendation for everybody that I work with, which is have a contract in place with anybody where services or money exchanges hands. Even if it's just something small, small. The thing that I think people don't realize is that let's say your payment from someone is quite small, but you're working on some creative content, the liability that could come from that may be much, much larger than whatever the payment was. Having an agreement in place that says, if you gave me content and then that content got me in trouble, that's on you to handle, then you're navigating that really well. And so I actually always say, and this is on the client and the lawyer, but three lines of defense. Your first line of defense is your contracts. Your second is insurance. And then your third is that business entity that we talked about at the outset. So contracts, that's one thing I would recommend. And then the other one is going to be just like influencer compliance. A lot of the time nowadays, if you are paid to review a product or give a shout out to a product, you need to notify your audience in some way that you are an influencer and that you were paid for this particular article or blog post.

[00:33:56.140] - Sam Mazzeo
And so that's something that I think there's actually FTC guidelines out there.

[00:34:00.420] - Liz Stapleton
There is. And they actually just updated the influencer one recently.

[00:34:05.170] - Sam Mazzeo
They're pretty straightforward. It's just making sure you know them and do them.

[00:34:08.490] - Liz Stapleton
Yeah, exactly. It doesn't have to be hard or super complicated. They really break it down to people, especially that aren't lawyers. That's a really good point about contracts. A lot of times I see people don't use contracts at all as a blogger, whether that's with a freelance writer that's doing something for them or a guest post, which no money exchanges hands. But are you going to be liable for what they wrote or sponsored content too. Someone just sponsors a post and money is changing hands. So it's always good to use a contract. It's a great point. Liability insurance is also a great thing. I've heard people getting insurance through their homeowners sometimes. So talk to maybe your own insurance companies, see if they offer any media liability insurance or something that would be affordable for you to do.

[00:34:55.450] - Sam Mazzeo
Essentially, you'll be having the same conversation three times whenever you start out to get your ducks in a row because you'll have it with a lawyer, you'll have it with a CPA, and you'll have it with an insurance broker. Like I said, same conversation because you have to tell them what you're doing so that they can source out what you need. You're going to feel pretty repetitive in those early stages, but it's all worth it, I say, in the long run.

[00:35:15.270] - Liz Stapleton
Absolutely. And it is tough because blogging in the online world is such a different... It's a little bit of the Wild West because legislation hasn't fully caught up. I was talking to an accountant in Washington. He's like, Well, are you charging sales tax for your digital products? And I was like.

[00:35:31.750] - Sam Mazzeo
No.

[00:35:32.320] - Liz Stapleton
But do I need to be? But only in Washington?

[00:35:34.550] - Sam Mazzeo
It's like, yeah.

[00:35:38.030] - Liz Stapleton
There is some wiggle room here and there, but it's better to go after the information and try to make sure you're as protected as possible. I think you gave some great tips on that. So thank you very much. Any final words for those watching?

[00:35:53.230] - Sam Mazzeo
Just thanks for having me. I think part of my job as an attorney, and I think the one that I take most importantly is that I'm actually here to educate and empower people and help them understand, because a lot of you out there are smart enough to do a lot of this on your own. And so you just need to clarify the confusing different five articles that you read online. And so, yeah, I would say if you do have any other questions, check out Five Minute Lawyer. I am an attorney in my daily life as well. And so we're certainly here to help if you're in California. I would say just make sure that you always take a deep breath. Everything is scary when you're doing business, and a lot of it sucks, but the sweet isn't as sweet without the sour. So make sure you just handle the sucky stuff first.

[00:36:32.830] - Liz Stapleton
Yes, absolutely. And Five Minute Lawyer is really awesome, guys. He's got some great videos on there. You should absolutely check it out. The link is below. And with that, I'm going to go ahead and we'll talk to you next time.
