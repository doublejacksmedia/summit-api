Liz Stapleton [00:00:00]:
Alright, guys. I'm excited for this session with Hannah from hannahljohnson.com. Hannah, welcome. Thank you so much for doing this.

Hannah Johnson [00:00:05]:
Thank you so much for having me. I'm excited to be here.

Liz Stapleton [00:00:08]:
Yeah. Because you're gonna be talking about how to use Pinterest, not just I mean, I think everyone thinks of Pinterest for, like, getting their blog content there. And, yes, it's great for that, but it's it's great for marketing period and including marketing ways that make you money directly, not just like they go to your blog post and they maybe find something. You know? so can you tell us a little bit about your background and what what we're gonna learn?

Hannah Johnson [00:00:32]:
Yeah. Of course. So I am a blog and Pinterest specialist. They pair together really well, but what a lot of people don't under end is once you start making money with your blog, it becomes a business. So those of you that are like, oh, I don't really know if I wanna create a business you're going to want to because that's when the money comes in. And I, kind of stumbled upon my Pinterest strategy that I have been kind of perfecting for the last couple of years, and I ended up making just three pins to sell a digital ebook that I created and that made me $3000 in 3 months. And I just created those 3 pins pinned them, and they went viral, and it was crazy. And from then, I've kind of specialized in getting really specific with that and selling that digital content and also affiliate links and doing that whole thing with blogging on Pinterest because it's basically on autopilot, and it's Awesome. Consistent passive income is what we're going for, and that is that's what I specialize in. That's what they do.

Liz Stapleton [00:01:34]:
Yes. So, I'm excited to dig in for you to teach us how we can sort of accomplish similar results. So I'm gonna let you go ahead and take over let's let's go.

Hannah Johnson [00:01:33]:
Passive income with Pinterest on autopilot. Today, I'm gonna be talking with you about how you can drive tons of traffic, tons of income into your pockets with digital products on Pinterest. Before we get into the talk, I'd love for you to connect with me on Instagram. Tag me on Instagram stories. Tell me why you are here watching this talk If you have an idea for a digital product, share that with me. I'd love to hear what you're creating, what you wanna create, and why you wanna create it. So what you can expect from this talk today is learning the different types of income, what from blogging that you can that you can make from blogging, the power of Pinterest, why we're going to be focusing on digital products and not the other forms of income, and then also I'm gonna be teaching you my 4 pillars to selling success on Pinterest. So passive income with blogging, there's 4 main ways I have not found any other way to really make passive income with blogging, other than these 4, but digital products is my number one and the way that I love to make money ads is the second, and I would say probably the most popular way to make money, affiliate marketing, probably second most popular way. and then the brand end, the brand collaboration slash deals. Typically, when people come into the blogging community, they are looking to make money with ads affiliate marketing, brand collaborations, digital products, or something that's a little more scary because it, it involves you creating something that you're going to sell. And selling really kind of makes people turn away and get a little nervous because they feel like they're being sleazy selling and and all that stuff, but I really want to make it clear that you are selling to these people, especially with Pinterest, Pinterest allows you to reach your ideal audience and sell to them and and give them access to your product and they purchase without even speaking to you. So they know that your product is not only good enough, but also going to help them, which is why they're going to invest money into it. You're not messaging people, you're not in an MLM. This is something that you are doing on autopilot because you've created such an irresistible offer. A little bit of the power of Pinterest, the life of a Pinterest pin is 1600 times longer than that of an Instagram or a Facebook post. Now, just by being on Pinterest and sharing a pin, you already will be able to reach an audience that is larger than you could on Instagram with a post or a story on there. These are a couple of demograph demographic type statistics. There are over

Hannah Johnson [00:04:43]:
300,000,000 active Pinterest users, and that number is growing every single day.

Hannah Johnson [00:04:49]:
70% of those users are female, and 40% of the new user sign ups are male. So even though this platform is primarily female, men are getting on board with Pinterest and and starting to use it a little more. Millennials use Pinterest as much as they use Instagram. And this is kind of a metric that shocks a lot of people especially in the kind of digital world because although Pinterest is not a social media form, it's definitely thrown in there more than what it should be. and not only that, but because Instagram is so big, people don't even think about Pinterest in terms of marketing efforts. So it's really, really important to understand that millennials are using Pinterest just as much as they're using Instagram. And a couple metrics in terms of, money 50% of Pinterest users earn $50,000 or greater per year, and that's per user. That's a user, 50 percent of the overall users. So 50 percent of the 300,000,000 active users are earning quite a bit of money per year. And not only that, but 40% of pinners have a household income of over a $100,000 a year.

Hannah Johnson [00:06:09]:
10% of Pinterest households making greater than a

Hannah Johnson [00:06:11]:
$125,000 a year compared to the US average household income of $63,000 a year. These net these next two metrics are by far my favorite, They really, really show not only the power of Pinterest, in general, but also the power that Pinterest has in terms of selling. selling, it doesn't matter if it's a digital or physical in this sense. I will explain why we're gonna talk about digital products, in a moment, but

Hannah Johnson [00:06:43]:
64% of Pinterest users described the platform as a place to find ideas products or services that they can trust, meaning, this is the platform that they use 64% of those users use this place. So over 50% as a way to find products and services that they wanna use. And then this next metric is by far my favorite.

Hannah Johnson [00:07:18]:
84% of Pinner's use Pinterest to decide what to buy. And basically what that means is there is no reason why you should not be creating something to sell on this platform? Because they're coming people are coming to Pinterest to purchase and making decisions, making purchasing decisions on the platform already, so why not give them a reason to purchase from you? So now I'm gonna tell you why we wanna focus on digital products. Now think about this really quickly before even reading what I have on the screen. If you are somebody, which I'm assuming you've used Pinterest before, since you are at a blogging summit, you Start a blog and you are looking for tips. You try Google. You're looking on Pinterest and all of a sudden you come across a a page. And on this page, they have an ebook for sale. The ebook is $9 and they're telling you that they will give you step by step instructions on how to start your blog for just $9. If you're somebody trying to start a blog, that's gonna seem very appealing to you. But there's also a lot of free information out there about how to start a blog. So maybe you're probably thinking, I don't know if I really wanna invest the $9, but then you scroll down a little more and you see the first the first chapter of the book is free. So not only are you able to see what the first step of creating a successful blog is, and how to get started, but they're literally giving you the rest of the information for just $9. Now if you're someone who didn't really have a lot of time or doesn't really want to spend a lot of time searching, then you may wanna be investing in this product. That's kind of a scenario that a lot of people go through. And not only that, but the the bet the main reason why I really love digital products is because you feed into the customer or the reader or the purchaser's excitement They're excited about starting a blog. They're excited about learning how to sew or getting, more growth on Instagram or whatever it is. when you give them access to a product that's going to save them time or teach them everything that they need to know, They are going to be so enticed to purchase because they get it immediately. They don't have to wait for Amazon to deliver it or wait a week for them to get it in the mail. Not only that, but that free chapter that I mentioned before allows them to get a taste of what they have or what they're going to get before they buy. We'll get into more of this later in the 4 pillars of, selling success, but tip number one of selling is always give free content. I feel like that's probably known pretty well in this in the whole selling aspect things, but anyway, the last reason why I really like digital products because they give you a one end done approach. You are able to create a product one time, and you're done. There's no stock that you have to keep. You don't have to keep create recreating the product. You just have to update it when you want to, or if you're selling templates or something like that, you don't even have to update it. They just purchased one time and they're done. So let me talk about the 4 pillars to selling success on Pinterest in 2020. The 4 pillars are market research, landing and sales page design, supporting content, and your Pinterest strategy. The reason why I specifically picked these 4 pillars is because these are what I have found in my 5 years of working with blogging and Pinterest to be the most important. Let me dive in. Market research is by far the most important pillar. If you can't get market research down, then you definitely need to reevaluate because a 100% of time, your audience will tell you what they want. Always, always ask And if you don't have an audience, you can start with something small like an ebook to build up your audience. However, you should always look at what other players in your industry are doing. What are what have they been successful with? What are they doing that they could be doing better? What are they not doing that they should be doing? Those are all notes that you should be jotting down and paying attention to. because that's what's going to set you apart. Now if you are somebody, for example, who is wanting to teach somebody how to fly fish, Maybe you go on Pinterest, do some keyword research, and figure out what your specific audience is looking for in terms of live fishing. Do they wanna learn everything? Are they only specifically trying to figure out the best ways to cast? I'm not a fly fishing expert. That's just the example that popped into my head. but think about and try and do as much research as you can because that market research aspect of it will be the key to success for you. If you can create an audience if you can create a product that your audience is dying for, that they can't live without that will save them time, that will save them money, and overall will save them from failing, then you have just created your ticket to success. These precise and smart about your product creation do not just create a product that you think your audience will want. That is the biggest mistake that I see so many bloggers and online entrepreneurs make. they just create something that they think their audience will want. You are an expert in selling, and you think that your audience wants to know everything about selling, when in reality, they only wanna learn one thing. Start there first. Okay. Landing page design. You can create an amazing product all day long, but if your landing page or your sales page does not speak to your audience, then you're not gonna make any sales. And the reason why I didn't like, have a pillar in the 4 pillars to selling success on copywriting is because, yeah, copywriting is super important if you are selling a very high ticket item. However, if you're starting small with video trainings and templates and courses, or ebooks? It's not as important if you have the other things in place. So my number one tip going back to the one that I already gave you is always offer something free. The first chapter, a virtual tour, the first module, something to get your audience to trust and understand that you know what you're talking about. No matter what price is, it's an investment to them. So you wanna show them exactly what you are going to give them. Stopping really quickly right here just to do a side note. When I created my first digital product, It was everything you need to know about Instagram and becoming an Instagram influencer, growing your audience, and working with brands. with 3 pins, I made $3000 because I created a gallery on the sales page, or I call it a landing page because I wasn't it wasn't a traditional sales page. And I created a gallery that gave away the first twelve pages of the book. It had the title the table of contents, the welcome page, and the first whole chapter. Now, here's the tip. Again, you're not trying to give away your secrets in this free content. but you're trying to give them a little bit. So, for example, my first chapter was about the Instagram algorithm, describing what it was, all of the different metrics, everything we knew and could be researched on for the algorithm. That was stuff that was already that could already be found on the internet. However, I added my thoughts and my strategies on how we can take the information that we know from the Instagram algorithm and make it work for us instead of fighting it. So not only was I giving the audience a convenient way to view all of the information on the algorithm, but I was also giving them a little bit of information for free about how to use the algorithm to work for you. And then also, I was kind of showing them how I write. I have been a blogger long enough that I understand that my audience loves the way I write because I write like I talk. That's just something that they like. I have had so many people come to me and say, I can't believe how much information you gave away on your landing page. That was amazing. I purchased just because of that. And then I've also had other people come to me and say that they purchased just because they liked the way that I talked. They liked the way that I described things. I described things in a way that was easy to understand. Those are all little tiny consumer things that you may not remember or put into, effect when you're creating this product. So make sure to really get into the mind of your audience in the, in, in the mind of your customer when you're creating the sales page, the landing page, and the product in general. So many times I see people creating landing pages for their products and not adding the price You want to be upfront about your price with your audience. You want to make sure that they know exactly what it is upfront, honestly, and authentically. Don't try to hide it. Don't get them to click on the the checkout page so they can see the the price. Just give it to them upfront. and make sure that they know exactly what the investment is upfront and center. Now supporting content This I have to say is the 2nd biggest pillar because if you were someone who tried to sell a digital product before and completely flopped? I'm assuming this is what you did. You created a landing page, you created the product, you wrote a blog post about it and you shared it on social media, but you got nothing but crickets. That's because you did it wrong. You didn't create any supporting content. You created one social media post and a blog post. You shared it around one time and you expected people to purchase. or maybe you shared it 5 or 10 times and still nobody purchased. The reason why is because you need to be creating supporting blog posts, not just one multiple. Inside of pinning profit, which is my, newly launched program, I teach my easy content creation method, and that helps you create profitable content, know how much of that content to create, when to create it, and when to share it. But just as a little introduction to that, If you have one digital product, you should be writing a minimum of 5 supporting blog posts about it. And then each of those blog posts should have 10 pins created for it for them. So a total of 50 pins for those blog posts and 5 social media posts and stories created as well in addition. That way, you can not only share content over the course of a couple months, but you're not pressed for time creating the content. You have this content already available in your queue. You can be organized and know exactly when you should share it and how you should share it. I get sales through Instagram consistently because of this strategy. because I'm creating supporting content, and I'll get more into this in the Pinterest strategy in just a moment, but people need to see something multiple times before they purchase And if you're just pitching them constantly and constantly, they're not gonna purchase. They want the supporting content, so they know you know what you're talking about. It's just like the landing page strategy, but overall in these blog posts, you're going to be sending them to the landing page. So you, for example, let me give you this little, like, preview. You I created my Instagram ebook. So maybe the blog post that I the supporting blog posts that I create are how to grow your Instagram following, then I add 10 tips in there, just 10, or how to get started with brands on Instagram, and I have a couple tips in there. it's that, it's that little bit of content that you're just expanding on the topic and then saying, Hey, if you want more, here's this awesome, like, $10 ebook or $20 ebook that I created, that's gonna tell you everything you need to know about X Y Z. Or if you're going with a more specific topic then you can still say this is everything that you need to know about how to cast as a fly fisherman. I mean, going back to that horrible example, that is something that you can do. Now, with your Pinterest Strategy, fresh new content is the key to success, and this is where that supporting content comes in even better. Now, obviously, there's a lot more to a Pinterest strategy than just creating content, how many pins you're pinning a day, what your pins look like. There's a whole science to pin design, but just to give you a little bit of information and not completely overwhelm you with everything Pinterest related, new content and fresh content, and supporting content is the key on Pinterest. when I was selling my ebook, I got lucky and I had pins that were going to my landing page go viral, and they're actually still going viral almost a year later. However, it's not always that easy. I work with Pinterest clients every single day who are trying to sell digital products, and it's very difficult to get their landing pages to go viral if they've just started an account or if they're transitioning their audience. It's very easy to get lucky if you have the pin science down and all of that stuff, but there are other key factors that play into your pins going viral. But the more content you create, the more chances you have to go viral. Not only that, but while I'm here, just to put a random side note in here, repins are key. And I'm actually giving you something that's totally, like, not even a part of selling digital products, but with the rise of tailwind tribes being so popular, It's really important to remember that when somebody pins your pin from a tribe, it counts as a new pin, not a re pin, and re pins are very, very key to going viral on the platform. For a pin to go viral, it has to have the initial engagement, and you can't get that just from tribes. So make sure that you aren't While you are focusing on tribes and your strategy, you're also focusing on other areas of Pinterest to ensure those repins are happening. Tip number 2 for Pinterest is something and this is I already mentioned this, but people need to see something on average seven to eight times before they purchase. Sometimes you get lucky and they purchase the first time, but most of the time, They won't. This is where that supporting content comes in. You can get hit for spam very easily with your account deleted on Pinterest However, if you're sharing just the landing page over and over and over again, that is not what you wanna do. If someone is clicking on your Pinterest pin, once they will see your content again and again. They may not see the same content or the same pin but they will see that supporting content that you've created. The more content you create not only allows you more options to go viral, but it also gives your audience more chances to see it. Therefore, giving them more chances to buy it. An awesome little bonus. I wanted to talk with you about the different types of digital products that you can create, there are a ton, as you can see here, ebooks courses, cookbooks, if you're a food blogger, audiobooks, printables, templates, this can literally work for anyone. It doesn't matter the niche you are in. Maybe you are somebody who, like I said, is a food blogger who has no idea how else to monetize except with ads. You could create a cookbook or a training, a video training or even a course on how to get started with cooking. There are so many different digital products that you can create, and that is why selling a digital product on Pinterest as a blogger can work for every single niche. If you wanted to create a journal or maybe you wanted to create a planner or something like that for your audience to track specific things, If you are in the mental health community, I know journals are really, really popular. I have some members inside of pinning profit currently that are working on doing a journal and also a planner so that they can track different things that are specific to them that they may not be able to find in a normal planner that you can get at TJ Maxx or something like that. And the other thing that I also wanted to talk to you about is pricing because I know how important pricing is, and this is also something I talk about inside of the program. However, I wanted to give you guys this little tidbit tip, about pricing your digital product So ebook should be ranging between 10 ish dollars $39. $39 is a very high side when you're selling on Pinterest and you're a beginner, I would definitely recommend staying within the

Hannah Johnson [00:25:35]:
$8.99 to $19.99 range And then for courses, those can range from $27 to

Hannah Johnson [00:25:42]:
$2,000 plus. It all depends on how much content you create. It all depends on what's included. maybe you are offering support or you are offering a bunch of additional items or bonuses then your your course is probably gonna be worth a little bit more than normal. Templates are the next product that we're gonna be talking about, and those can range from $5 to

Hannah Johnson [00:26:09]:
$39 or even above depending on what type of template that you're making. Planners can be, a template printables also go in this price range of 5 to $39. It really all depends on what you're creating, but that's a really good price range to start. If you are just starting out, I would recommend looking at the competition. What are they selling it for? maybe price yourself a little lower until you can get some sales. At launch, maybe you'll wanna give them a discount code. And then for video trainings, those depend on how many videos you have in your series. those can range from $15 to a

Hannah Johnson [00:26:46]:
$127 plus depending on what you are creating. A super, super important note as you are watching this only create one product at a time. I know how exciting it can be. I'm sure you have a 1000000 and 10 ideas rushing into your head on ways that you create a digital product and sell it on Pinterest, but only create one product at a time. It is so stressful to create a product in general. to launch it and to create actual profitable, consistent income from it. So you're gonna wanna only do one at a time. The other reason is because when you start adding more products to your to do list, you instantly become less productive And there's a whole entire science behind that. I promise you, you should you should create one product at time. And if you're curious on why I'm saying that if you try to create more than 1, you'll instantly become less, productive, you can check out the free master class that I have. I believe it's linked below. that talks about why you should only focus on one thing at a time, especially when you're creating a product after you've created this product and you've started making money and Pinterest's new sales on autopilot, then you can create another one. But for now, just focus on one.

Hannah Johnson [00:28:11]:
Just to give a little bit of a recap and a takeaway from today's talk, Pinterest users buy. They are coming to Pinterest to learn, to get inspiration, to get ideas, and to make purchasing decisions, and this goes for people that are offering services that are selling digital products, that are selling physical products, The reason why digital products are my favorite and in my opinion, the best way to go is because they are one and done. You can create something once and profit off it multiple times. They also allow your audience to get immediate access to the product and you're able to feed off their excitement. There are 4 pillars to selling success on Pinterest. Do your market research. Give something away for free with no email sign up necessary on the landing or sales page. You don't wanna make them give you an email address. You just wanna be a good Samaritan and give it away for free. just give it away. And if it hurts you to give it away, that means it's good. That means even though you are giving away maybe one trick out of your bag, you still have a whole bag left. Create that supporting content. For every digital product, you should at least make a minimum of 5 blog posts. If you wanna be super awesome, you can create 10, but I know it's difficult to create 10 supporting blog posts around one topic. and then always have a good Pinterest strategy. Make sure that you're making multiple pins per post. Make sure that you're sharing those pins. The fresh content is really awesome. The new pins, the reason why I told you each of those blog posts should have 10 pins is because that will give you enough to share 2 pins a week for 5 weeks, and then you can create more pins. stuff like that. I'm giving you little, little digestible nuggets here that will, allow you to be successful on the platform. If you have any other questions, you can feel free to find me on Instagram.

Liz Stapleton [00:30:12]:
Alright, Hannah. Thank you so much for those, that that great information about how to better use Pinterest, not just to market content, but to market products and things that make you money, So thank you. Any final words on that?

Hannah Johnson [00:30:27]:
just if you are somebody that really, really wants to make money, especially, like, upfront, not have it take a 1000 years to do so. Digital products are the way to go. a lot of people are are talking about how blogging takes years to grow that following. You don't need a following, especially with Pinterest. Pinterest brings the following to you while also making you money by selling that digital content?

Liz Stapleton [00:30:52]:
Yes. So definitely take action on that. There's sessions on how to create various digital products in the summit, so watch those get going marketing on Pinterest. Hopefully, that will help you out. And I know you've got some great free resources for our attendees. Can you tell us about that?

Hannah Johnson [00:31:07]:
Yes. So I have a free master class. If you wanna check that out, I'm sure the links are below. And basically what that does is it walks you through some of the strategies that I teach, and also kind of talks a little bit more about kind of how Pinterest is used for digital product, selling. And I kind of get a little bit more specific on the mindset aspect of selling and that you're not really even selling. You're helping these people, which I'm sure is reiterated on their summit.

Liz Stapleton [00:31:38]:
Yeah. We have a mindset session too. So, yeah, Don't you worry. but, yeah, but it is tough because, you know, people shy away from selling and so are -- Yeah.

Hannah Johnson [00:31:47]:
because it's definitely great.

Liz Stapleton [00:31:49]:
resource for attendees. Definitely check that out. It's free. The link is below. And then I know you also have a special offer for our All Access Pass holders. Can you tell us about that?

Hannah Johnson [00:31:58]:
Yes. I have a new course in group coaching program that just launched this February. And, basically, the reason why it's formatted as a program is because There are a lot of courses and, digital products out there that kind of teach you how to utilize Pinterest and teach you how to sell and also make money with your blog, but they're lacking the support aspect. So, basically, what Pending profit does is it helps you step by step teach you how to create this passive con like, consistent passive income for bloggers and online entrepreneurs so you can kind of take that step up. and create this full time blogging life that you've wanted and that you've dreamed of.

Liz Stapleton [00:32:38]:
Yeah. And you've got a discount. So so -- Yes. -- so for the All Access Pass, I always get a a exclusive discount how much how much was the discount?

Hannah Johnson [00:32:46]:
It's 40% off.

Liz Stapleton [00:32:47]:
Okay. Yeah. So that's that's a great deal. So if you guys are interested in kind of taking this a step further, getting that support, and you are an All Access Pass holder, or if you're not, get the All Access Pass. And then, you know, because the value of the All Access Pass is still gonna, like, save you more than what you would yeah. So definitely check that out. Hannah, thank you so much for your time.
