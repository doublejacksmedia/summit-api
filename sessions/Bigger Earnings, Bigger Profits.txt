Kesha JonTae [00:00:12]:
Hello. Hello. Hello, everyone. Thank you for tuning in to my presentation today. My name is Kesha JonTae. I'm an income tax strategist and today, I want to talk to you about one of my most favorite subjects ever, taxes. Now I know some of you are probably thinking taxes? What kind of weirdo likes talking about taxes? It's me. I'm that weirdo.

Kesha JonTae [00:00:34]:
So allow me to introduce myself because I'm sure most of you have absolutely no idea who I am. Again, my name is Kesha JonTae. I'm an income tax strategist and I work with small business owners including content creators, influencers and bloggers just like you to keep more of your hard earned money in your own pockets and out of Uncle Sam's hands. I have worked in the tax departments of multi million dollar corporations helping some of the richest people in the country save thousands of dollars on their tax liability and I created the Millennial Taxpert to help small business owners, again, just like you do the same. Now I have a few degrees and some fancy licenses and taxation and I've been working in the industry for over 15 years at this point. So instead of calling myself a weirdo, I like to say that I'm more of a tax nerd, if you will. And my mission is to make sure that every taxpayer is equipped with the knowledge and the resources to legally reduce their tax liability. So today, we're going to be talking about how you can keep more of your own money in your own pockets with some advanced tax deductions that you can use as a high earning blogger content creator influencer.

Kesha JonTae [00:01:39]:
My goal is to show you how to use these advanced strategies to maximize your tax savings, which can free up some cash flow so that you can reinvest in your business, your future, take yourself on a vacation, whatever it is that you want to do with your money instead of give it to the IRS. Now during this presentation, I'm going to be sharing a lot of information with you. So to make sure that you don't miss out on anything, go ahead and close out of any of your extra tabs, turn off your notifications, grab a pen and some paper and take some good notes. In today's presentation, I'm going to be sharing with you 3 advanced tax deductions that you may or may not have heard of, but that you can definitely take advantage of as a high earning content creator, blog, or influencer. I'm going to be showing you how to maximize those savings and I'm gonna be giving you some actionable steps that you can take to take advantage of these deductions right now during this tax season. Now before we get into all of that, let's talk briefly about why this even matters. It matters because the more and more money you make in your business, the higher and higher your tax rate gets. And the higher and higher your tax rate gets, the more and more money that you pay in income tax.

Kesha JonTae [00:02:43]:
Now also, the higher and higher your tax bracket, the more valuable deductions are to you. So for example, if you're in the 22% tax bracket and you have a $100 deduction, that's gonna save you $22 in taxes. If you're in the 37% tax bracket and you have a $100 deduction, that's gonna save you $37 in tax. So the more and more money you make is even more crucial that you're taking advantage of all the deductions that you qualify for because that's where you're gonna see big tax savings. Now that's not to say that if you're in a lower tax bracket, you shouldn't be looking for all of your deductions. You absolutely should always be trying to max out your deductions. But the more money you make and the higher your tax bracket, it becomes even more crucial to make sure that you're taking advantage of every deduction that you can so you're not paying any more in tax than you absolutely have to. Now anytime I start talking about maximizing deductions or taking advantage of advanced tax strategies, I start getting a little bit of pushback.

Kesha JonTae [00:03:48]:
So let's address those right now. Some of the most common ones that I hear are one, hey. I've already maxed out all of my deductions and that may be true to where you have maxed out the deductions that you know about, but the tax code is vast. It's thousands and thousands of pages long and there's so much stuff in there that may apply to you that you don't even know about. So it's always good to work with somebody to see if there's something else that you can be taking advantage of to free up some cash flow to reinvest in your business or again, in your own self because we love a good self care moment. Okay? The second thing that I hear about is implementing these advanced tax strategies seems to be entirely too complicated and not worth it. And I don't want anybody to get caught up in the term advanced tax strategies because while they while it's true that some things are very intensive to get set up, some of these advanced strategies, once you learn about them, they're very simple to implement and you realize that they don't take any additional time and actually, it might just be something that you're able to take advantage of or something that you're already doing. So it's no extra burden on you or no extra lift in order to be able to get this deduction and maximize your and minimize your tax liability, I should say.

Kesha JonTae [00:05:09]:
And the last thing that I hear a lot is, hey. I already work with a tax professional. I've been working with this person for a million years at this point and if I was eligible for it, they would know about it and they would tell me. And what I say to that is that not all tax professionals are created equal and that's no shade. It's just that some people specialize in certain things and some people may not understand certain advantages or certain opportunities that there are out there that might apply to your situation. Also, what I have found is that for the most part, people only work with their tax professional one time a year and it's during January through April when they're trying to get their return done and their tax professionals are super busy and they don't have a lot of time to sit down and really dig into your tax situation and figure out what the actual opportunities there are for you. And so they really just kind of get surface level with the opportunities that they can find for you just maxing out the deductions that you already have taken and not necessarily able to figure out what strategies you should be able to implement going forward. And so your tax professional is probably doing an amazing job with the information that they have, but they may not necessarily have that time or that capacity to go deeper to figure out what other opportunities there are out there.

Kesha JonTae [00:06:24]:
So just keep all of that in mind. We're going through this presentation. So let's go ahead and talk about some of these tax deductions. The first one being hiring your family members. Now I know that you probably have heard all over social media about how you should hire your children, pay them $12,000 because then they don't have to pay income tax on that money and you get a tax deduction so then you don't have to pay income tax on that money. I'm not gonna go into detail about that because there's so much content out there. I even have podcast episodes and YouTube videos about it on my channels But what I don't really hear a lot about is the fact that you can hire your parents, you can even hire your spouse and still get tax deductions. The benefits of hiring your family members, whether that be your children, your spouse, or your parents, is that you are getting a business expense because you're hiring them as employees and you're paying them wages just like you would some random person off the street, but you're keeping the money in the family.

Kesha JonTae [00:07:21]:
So you have not changed the amount of money that you have in your family, but you're reducing the amount of tax that you're paying on it. As I mentioned, there is a lot of content out there in social media about hiring your children, and for a lot of people, it makes sense. But when it comes to hiring your mom and dad or your spouse, sometimes it doesn't make quite as much sense on how you can actually benefit from that. So let's stay here for a moment and walk through what the benefit is when you hire your parents or you hire your spouse in your business. So for a lot of us, it's our turn to support our parents just like they supported us for our entire lives. We're paying their mortgages or they were paying their rents or we're paying for utilities or buying groceries or maintaining the family home, or buying new cars, or paying for maintenance on the car. Maybe we are helping out with medical expenses, or paying for travel, or giving them money to go to the casino, or whatever it is, we're paying for it in a lot of cases. And obviously, we love to do it.

Kesha JonTae [00:08:22]:
We we're happy to do it because we love our parents or at the very least, we feel obligated. But, you know, it doesn't hurt to get a little something something for our efforts in April when uncle Sam comes around with his hands out. But here's the thing. If you are supporting your parents, like, genuinely supporting your parents and you qualify to claim them as a dependent, you might get a $500 credit on your tax return. And you might be able to take a deduction for their medical expenses on your tax return if you can itemize and if your those expenses are high enough to make a difference, or hear me out, you can hire them in your business. That is if they do wanna go back to work because we know how our parents can get about their retirement. Right? You can hire them in your business as a bona fide employee. You can pay them a salary that covers the support that you typically give them.

Kesha JonTae [00:09:13]:
So you know how much money you're giving them per year around about how much money you're giving them per year for their household expenses or for their travel expenses or for their entertainment expenses. You know roughly about how much you're paying them for that or you're giving them for that. And as long as you can support that being a reasonable wage, you can pay them that salary as an employee in your business. Then you get to take a deduction for that on your tax return. It's the same money that you were spending out anyway, but now we've created a structure in which it becomes deductible for you on your business and you are able to reduce your tax liability. Seniors that are at least 65 years old get a little bit of a bump in their standard deduction, which means that they can make more money than somebody that's not 65 before they're required to file a tax return. So even if you're paying them more than their standard deduction, shifting that income from you at a higher tax bracket to them at a lower tax bracket, assuming they don't have any other income, will reduce the overall tax that's paid on that income. Even if they do have to pay tax on it, they're likely not paying tax at the rate that you're paying tax.

Kesha JonTae [00:10:27]:
And because they are your parents, their wages are not subject to federal unemployment tax. If you were to hire somebody off the street, if you were to hire a non family member to come in and work for you, then the money that you pay them, you would have to pay payroll tax on, the federal unemployment tax, state unemployment tax, in addition to your their regular salary. But if your employer if your, employee is your parent, is not subject to the federal unemployment tax, so you're saving money there too. So now the question you might be thinking is, okay, paying your children makes sense, got it. Paying my mom and dad makes sense, got it. But Keisha, you mentioned paying my spouse, and that just doesn't make sense to me because if I pay my spouse, yes, I get a tax deduction on my business income, but I'm just creating income for my spouse and that means it's gonna raise the income back up. So how does that create any kind of a benefit? I am glad that you asked. So this is going to sound a little bit out of order, but I promise I'm a bring it back.

Kesha JonTae [00:11:39]:
If you're not covered by an employer sponsored health plan, and honestly, sometimes even if you are covered by an employer sponsored health plan. The rising cost of healthcare may be something that concerns you. True, everything is going up, but healthcare always seems to just be going up by a lot. Right? And depending on your situation, you may not be able to take a deduction for all or any of your medical expenses. But there is a better way and it's called a MERF, a medical expense reimbursement plan. Now I'm not gonna get into all of the nitty gritty details because it is a lot, but essentially, what it is is an alternative to group health insurance that allows employees to get a tax free allowance for out of pocket medical expenses. Tax free allowance for out of pocket medical expenses. Stay with me here.

Kesha JonTae [00:12:29]:
Right? The employee pays for the medical expenses, and then the company reimburses the employee. The downside of a MRF is that only bona fide employees can take advantage of the medical expense reimbursement plan. If you are a sole proprietorship or you're an LLC and you have not elected to be taxed as any kind of corporation, you're still considered to be a sole proprietor, then you would not qualify to be able to create one of these plans for yourself and take advantage of the medical expenses medical expense reimbursement unless, stay with me, you hire your spouse. Absolutely. You hire your spouse as an employee. Their entire salary goes towards medical expense reimbursement. You get a deduction for it on your tax return. They don't have to pay tax on it because it's considered a fringe benefit and fringe benefits are pretax.

Kesha JonTae [00:13:26]:
And it's okay for you to pay your employee, as long as they agree, in 100% pretax benefits. Like, you don't have to pay them a cash salary. You just wanna make sure that you bump up the benefits enough, the salary enough to cover the FICA taxes, Social Security and Medicare because it is still subject to FICA but it's not subject to income tax. And so, therefore, now you've turned these medical expenses that you may not have been able to take a deduction for before into a deductible expense legally. So listen. We're only on the first deduction, and we've hired our kids. We've hired our spouses. We've hired our parents, and we've saved a lot of money already.

Kesha JonTae [00:14:08]:
What can I say? I love this stuff. Some examples of hiring your family members are you can hire your spouse as your social media manager. You can hire your parents to do administrative duties. You can hire your children as talent. I know a lot of you guys feature your children in your YouTube videos, in your blog photos, in your Instagram photos. You can hire them as talent, pay them as talent, and get a deduction for that. But again, you're keeping the money in the family because the money is going to your own child. Now the key to making this work is to be very intentional about creating an employer and employee relationship between yourself and the family member to avoid IRS scrutiny.

Kesha JonTae [00:14:52]:
That means treating them as if you would treat any other employee. Have a clear job description. Make sure what the work that they're doing aligns with that job description. Issue pay stubs and w two's. Keep track of their time. Pay them a reasonable wage. Make sure you're keeping track of all the employee paperwork. However you would treat a normal employee or a non family member employee, you need to treat your family member employee the exact same way.

Kesha JonTae [00:15:19]:
Otherwise, the IRS may be able to come in and say, this is not a real employer employee relationship and the money that you're paying them is not really for work and so we're disallowing the deduction. We don't want that to happen, right? So make sure that you're treating them as if you were treating them as if you would treat any other employee. The second deduction that I want to talk to you about is the deduction for contributing to your retirement account. Now this is another one that you may have already heard about, but maybe you're really not sure exactly how it works or you don't really understand what options there are or maybe you are contributing a little bit, but you're not really maxing it out because you're not a 100% positive on how it all works and what the impact is. So let's talk about it a little bit. When you contribute to a retirement account, you're saving money for the future and you're getting a deduction for it on your current tax return. This is what we call a tax deferred benefit because you're just kicking the tax down the road. You will pay tax eventually when you take the money out of the account, but in the current year, when you put the money in, typically, we expect that we are in a higher tax bracket when we're earning the money than we would be when we're retired.

Kesha JonTae [00:16:26]:
So we are banking on the fact that we're getting deduction at a higher rate now than the tax that we would pay in the future. Now the type of plan that you choose is gonna determine how much money you can contribute and the deadline for the contribution. So if you choose a a SEP IRA or a solo 401 k, you can contribute a maximum of $69,000 for 2024 or 25% of your net earnings from self employment, whichever one is lower. So you're gonna take all of your income minus all of your expenses that get you your net earnings, multiply that by 25%. That's gonna be the maximum that you can put in if it is less than $69,000 for 2024. In 2025, the limit goes up to $70,000. And I mentioned in 2024 even though right now it's 2025 because you can actually contribute to a SEP IRA in a simple excuse me, a solo 401 k up until April 15th this year of 2025 and you can make that contribution for 2024. A lot of people wait until they get their return completed to see what their net earnings are and then make a determination of how much money they wanna put into their retirement account.

Kesha JonTae [00:17:35]:
They do that and then they continue to lower their tax liability. For a simple IRA, you can put in a 100% of your net earnings up to $16,000 in 2024 and I believe $17,000 for 2025 and you have until January 30, 2025 to put the money in for 2024. Follow me? Makes sense? Great. Now I strongly suggest working with an adviser to get this set up to make sure that it's set up properly and that you can make the contributions for the year in which you wanna make the contributions. But in order to implement this, essentially, you're going to choose the best plan for you, determine how much money you can contribute, contribute it, deduct it on your tax return. It's as simple as that. The last thing I want to talk to you about today are the ADA tax incentives. ADA, of course, standing for Americans with Disabilities Act and this is one that you may not have heard of before, but essentially, you may qualify for a credit or deduction for costs incurred with making your website more accessible.

Kesha JonTae [00:18:35]:
Now the credit is designed to encourage small business owners, such as yourselves, to make improvements to your business, to your website, to your platform so that these things can become more accessible to people with disabilities and this credit can actually cover a substantial portion of those accessibility related expenses, including website modifications for you bloggers out there, up to a specific limit. The credit is calculated as 50% of your eligible expenses up to $5,000 The credit is up to $5,000 In order to calculate the credit, you do have to spend at least $250 before anything counts. So what that means is the first $250 of accessibility related expenses do not count towards this credit, but then the next $10,000 does count towards the credit and 50% of whatever you spend over the $250 up to the next $10,000 qualifies for the credit and that's how you get a maximum credit of up to $5,000 per year. Now the question you might have is, well what is an eligible expense for me as a blogger? Well, as a blogger, eligible expenses could include adding screen reader compatibility or enhancing usability for readers with visual impairments. It could be adding captions to your videos or offering transcripts for your video content. It could include adding alt text or making sure alt text is added to images for people that are using screen readers and it could also include just generally making navigation and design changes to your website that improve accessibility for everybody. So again, this is something that you might already be spending money on. You might already be paying somebody to capture your videos or transcribe your video content so that you can post it on your website.

Kesha JonTae [00:20:30]:
I know personally for me, if you go on my website, my YouTube videos, my podcasts, they're all transcribed and added to my website so if somebody wants to read it as opposed to listen to it or watch it, they have that option there. You might already be paying somebody to add alt text to your images for people that use screen readers. These are things that you might already be spending money on, but you weren't you didn't know that this credit was available. So you might be saying to yourself, Yeah, well I didn't know this credit existed, but I was already deducting these costs anyway. So what is the difference? Well, the difference is that if you have the opportunity to take a credit over a deduction, usually, you want to take the credit. Not necessarily in all cases. Very, very, very, very, very few cases have I seen where the deduction makes more sense, but usually, you want to take the tax credit because the tax credit is a dollar for dollar reduction in your tax. Remember I said earlier that if you are in a higher tax bracket, then a deduction is going to be worth more money to you than if you are in a lower tax bracket.

Kesha JonTae [00:21:38]:
Well, the tax credit, it doesn't matter what tax bracket you're in. A dollar reduction in tax is a dollar reduction in tax. So if you have a $5,000 credit, regardless of whether you're in the 12% tax bracket or the 30% tax bracket, you still are going to save $5,000 in tax. So if you've been deducting these costs that you actually qualify to get a credit for, you want to make sure you go back and look at those expenses and try to segregate them out so you can actually get a credit instead. Now in addition to the credit, there is a separate ADA tax deduction that allows businesses to deduct costs associated with removing physical, structural, and transportation barriers for people with disabilities. Usually, this deduction applies to physical spaces, but it can also be applied to digital accessibility in certain cases. So for example, if you are making substantial modifications to a website or a platform and you're making that website or platform more accessible, this deduction actually can help you and the deduction is up to $15,000 per year based on your eligible accessibility expenses. So your eligible expenses for the deduction is going to be again when you come in and you're making major or significant redesigns to your website to meet these accessibility standards.

Kesha JonTae [00:23:08]:
So for instance, if you are making major website upgrades to improve navigation, if you're adjusting colors for readability or if you're implementing keyboard only navigation options instead of having to use a mouse, for example, if you are paying for user testing or consulting for, you know, paying fees to a consulting firm or a consultant to come in and see how you can make your website more accessible to people with disabilities, those kind of costs can be included in eligible expenses for the ADA tax deduction. Again, unlike the credit, this one is going to fluctuate. The value of this one is going to fluctuate based on what your tax rate is. So if you are able to get the credit, again, I would suggest going to get the credit and then any expenses above and beyond that $10,000, you might be eligible to take this credit or excuse me, the deduction. One thing I do want to mention about the credit versus the deduction too that I didn't mention before is that in order to qualify for the credit, you have to be considered a small business. I did mention that earlier, but I didn't really define it. A small business in relation to this credit is a business with less than $1,000,000 in revenue or $1,000,000 or less in revenue or 30 or fewer full time employees. So if your blog or your content creation business is making over $1,000,000 in revenue or you have over 30 full time employees in your business, then you would need to go with the deduction versus the credit.

Kesha JonTae [00:24:49]:
But if you do meet the requirements to be considered a small business and you have the option to do the credit or the deduction, I would say again, go with the credit unless your expenses are higher and then you could also possibly get the deduction for the excess expenses. So to qualify for this credit, you wanna make sure that you're keeping records of all accessibility related expenses. You should be keeping records of all of your expenses to be fair, but kinda carve out all the expenses that are specifically related to, accessibility and make sure you complete form 8826 and attach it to your tax return. That's all you have to do in order to claim this credit. So let's recap. Today, we talked about hiring your family members, putting away money for retirement and the tax incentive that you may qualify for for making your website more accessible. All of these strategies each of these strategies alone can make a big impact, but imagine what you can do when you bundle them together and include other strategies that we didn't even talk about today. So here's some things that you can do right now to maximize these deductions before you even get on a call with the tax strategist.

Kesha JonTae [00:25:55]:
First of all, always make sure that you're keeping your business and your personal finances separate. I know that wasn't really the point of this presentation, but I always mention it because it is that important. Secondly, start thinking about how you can bring your family members into your business, what roles they can serve in your business, what work you really need them to do in your business, and start creating a job description for them so that when you hire them on, you already have that taken care of. Figure out how you want to save for retirement, what the right account is for you, start looking into the different options that are available for you and see which one works best for you, and start reviewing and recording any past accessibility improvements that you made to your website in 2024 since you haven't filed a tax return yet. You still might be able to qualify, and start planning any future improvements that you might wanna take on your website and take advantage of that credit this year. Remember, that credit and that deduction is an annual thing. So if you are making these expenses every year or you're making these improvements every year, you get that credit and that deduction or that deduction every year.
