[00:00:11.850] - Debbie
Hi, everyone. I'm Debbie Gartner, and I'm here to help you monetize your way to an extra $1,000 a month or whatever your goal is. Hopefully, this methodology will help you because because as you'll see, I've had more than my fair share of targets that I needed to hit and mishaps along the way. Okay, why am I doing this? As we all know, the economy is not so hot right now, and many of us are facing extra challenges.

[00:00:44.440] - Debbie
That could simply be because our business is not doing as well as we would like, or we needed to be, or it's having some declines, my business included. It could also be because of your job or your significant other's job, or your side gig or you know, anything, any sort of challenge like that. It could also be because you have higher expenses with inflation, or it could be because you have some unexpected expenses or surprises. And as you'll hear, I've had more than my fair share of these. Or so it seems.

[00:01:27.610] - Debbie
I think we all feel this way at times. By the way, this is normal. It may not feel like it's normal, but it is normal. It's the way business goes.

[00:01:40.080] - Debbie
It goes in cycles. Life, you know, has its surprises all the time. The better you learn how to look at these as challenges that you can overcome, the stronger you will be emotionally and financially, and the better able you will be to deal with this and to shade or insulate your business, so that it can weather the storms, because the storms will happen. I've had my own small business, local business, brick and mortar store before this. And you know, there are always challenges.

[00:02:23.810] - Debbie
Businesses always change. The market always changes. It's just a part of life. Okay, so what are we going to talk about? We're going to talk about setting a goal when you need to get some more money in the door and you need to do it relatively quickly.

[00:02:41.170] - Debbie
How you can build up to that goal and really think about the building blocks, so you're not just shooting in the dark. And then we're going to discuss the main ways to monetize. We'll talk about the ones you can activate quicker and the ones that may be more sustainable as well and more cumulative over time. Okay.

[00:03:03.880] - Debbie
Who am I? I'm Debbie Gartner, obviously. And I've been blogging since 2010. I've been an entrepreneur since before that. I have been monetizing my blog since 2017.

[00:03:17.890] - Debbie
And I've had experience in both a B to B and B to C world, both in corporate and in small business. I was able to get myself out of $238,000 of bad debt. I'm not talking about the debt on my home. I'm talking about bad debt. And I was able to do it in three and a half years without any savings, without any capital fund.

[00:03:50.860] - Debbie
I had to figure it out. My specialties lie in SEO, affiliate marketing, as well as email strategy, and analytics. They have served me well over my entire career in all my jobs. I also love pets. You may hear my new kitty come out and he is very vocal but very attached already.

[00:04:17.060] - Debbie
He's been with me for a week. But I love pets, I love wordles, Sudokus, and I love learning. I have a liberal arts education and an MBA, and as you'll see, I really believe in diversification of income streams and sources of traffic. And that really helps insulate your business. I do my best to be as transparent as I can.

[00:04:47.710] - Debbie
All right. So, what is my experience with building business plans or gap plans? They are really the same thing. So, first, before I even had my own small businesses, I worked in corporate America on some very large businesses. I worked at PNG and several other places like that. So, I have experience with big budgets as well as now with small budgets.

[00:05:14.450] - Debbie
All right, so how do we go about this? The first step is to figure out your goal. If you don't have a goal, you don't even know what you're shooting for, and you need to have a plan. If you don't have a plan, you're basically lost. Hope is not a good solution.

[00:05:34.810] - Debbie
Having a plan is a very good solution, even if the plan is wrong, even if the plan is off. If your assumptions are off, that's okay. You will learn to adjust as you need and as you put better numbers in there from real world experience of doing this.

[00:05:54.440] - Debbie
But start out with some assumptions. There have been many studies that show that when you do this, even if your assumptions are wrong, overall, you end up in a much better place. And that is what I'd encourage you to do. Figure out what you really need, not what you want, but what you absolutely need as a bare minimum.

[00:06:20.230] - Debbie
If you want to have a higher plan to shoot for as well, that is totally fine. But be realistic. This talk is more for people who are already making money, not people who have never made any money online before. Because I guess I would say anyone can do this. But if you haven't made money before, it's just going to take you longer to do and your assumptions will be further off.

[00:06:54.470] - Debbie
But this is intended to help people who have made money and now had a setback and need to regain that money, or they've had a new surprise and they need to work up to that. Once you start earning money, earning more money is easier and easier. So, first figure out your goal, and then try to figure out in very broad strokes, how you will get up to that goal. We will discuss later how you drill down for each of those pieces. I will go a tad out of order here, but that's what you were trying to do.

[00:07:35.880] - Debbie
Figure out your broad stroke goals in terms of what you can do and what you feel comfortable doing and what you feel is most promising.

[00:07:49.750] - Debbie
Okay, step two. This is a part that so many people miss. I'm going to go into more detail on this, but you need to have those building blocks. So, for me, when I basically lost everything and I found myself in a huge amount of debt, I figured out how much I needed to survive. And when I say survive, I mean the bare minimum.

[00:08:16.310] - Debbie
Not to lose my house and to be able to pay for things like food and medical and stuff like that. I live in a very high cost of living area, so chances are you don't need as much to survive as I did. Plus, you may not have a huge amount of debt like I did as well. But I said, my goal is $7,000. How am I going to do it?

[00:08:42.180] - Debbie
And I chose to do three things because these were three things that I thought I could do relatively well, relatively quickly, and it would get me there. So, my first big chunk was from freelancing. And for freelancing, I did blogging for others, and I did SEO.

[00:09:07.090] - Debbie
And I was able to make $4,000 a month pretty quickly within three months. And by the way, I had no experience freelancing. So, I just want to be clear a lot of this, I had no experience, okay? I had skills, but no experience. Okay?

[00:09:28.330] - Debbie
So, anyway, I got $4,000 a month from that within three months. But it wasn't enough because I needed $7,000. And I knew that I only had three weeks of savings. So, it's not like I had a lot of cushion or savings that I could work with here, or even invest. So, I basically found a part-time job.

[00:09:52.800] - Debbie
And for this, I was doing painting estimates. And by the way, I knew next to nothing about painting. I knew, you know, home decor somewhat, I knew flooring. And I figured, well, painting is kind of similar to flooring. I could probably learn that.

[00:10:10.530] - Debbie
But I was able to make about $2000-3000 a month doing that. I was paid on commissions only, and I myself had an existing blog that I was, when I turned the ads on, I was making, let's call it around fifteen hundred dollars a month. I learned affiliate marketing pretty quickly, but my income on my blog was simply coming from ads and affiliate marketing. When I add up those numbers, I end up with seven thousand five hundred dollars to eight thousand five hundred dollars a month. You can see that that number is higher than my goal of my bare minimum of $7,000 because I needed to make sure that I paid my mortgage.

[00:10:57.830] - Debbie
I needed to make sure that I could pay for my health insurance because I had a condition. Anyway, when your income is variable, you need to understand that some months, you will make more and some, you will make less. And there is no guarantee on any of this. So, when that happens, you need to build in a safety cushion and basically shoot for a higher goal. So that when you have those months where you are below the goal, you can make it through. Okay.

[00:11:41.890] - Debbie
Other months will help cover you and you keep that in your little, you know, one month of savings or whatever it is. But that's what I did. Okay, now before I forget, this is really important. If you need to get money in the door quickly, for whatever reason, you have bills to pay. You don't have any income coming in, 99.9% of the time, the fastest way to get money in the door is to do some sort of services or active income.

[00:12:18.020] - Debbie
It's not going to be through traditional blogging or ad revenue, not affiliate marketing, not products, not sponsored posts. These are all great ways to make money, but they all take time to build and they all have time delays in terms of when you get paid. Often you don't get paid for an extra two to three months. And most of us don't have lots of savings stocked away.

[00:12:49.220] - Debbie
I know I didn't. So, doing some sort of service where you get paid, you're basically trading time for money, your skills, your work. I don't care if it's skilled or unskilled, but do something that helps other people and that you can get paid for. It could be as simple as, you know, babysitting or doing freelance blogging like I did. There are many different things, but do something like that.

[00:13:25.570] - Debbie
So, you're focusing on active income. You need to do something and you will get paid right away for doing it. As many of you know, I am a big fan of passive income and that is what I do and where I do currently make the majority of my income. And it was my long term goal to go there. But it's not something I could rely on when I needed money right away because it takes time to build.

[00:13:57.720] - Debbie
So, I basically did both in parallel. And if you need to get money in quickly, I'd recommend the same for you. All right, so what can you do that's skilled or unskilled? Think about every single job, every single class you've taken in school, everything you've learned. Think about everything that your friends come to you for.

[00:14:19.680] - Debbie
What are you good at? It could be some random thing like picking out outfits for someone, or you know, taking care of pets, or helping people pick out computers, whatever the heck it is. Okay, it could be freelancing, which is a very broad category, but think about all the things you can do for other bloggers or other businesses. It could be writing, blogging, IT, web design, graphics, whatever. What are you good at and/or what can you do easily that you can monetize?

[00:14:55.160] - Debbie
It could be a part time job like I did. I did a painting, part time job could be house sitting, pet sitting, buying groceries for others. Don't worry about this being a glorious job. This is about getting money in the door and surviving. Later, you can evolve your skills and what you do, but make sure you are in the position to be able to do that by having money and not making the situation worse.

[00:15:29.210] - Debbie
You can be a virtual assistant. You can help other bloggers or other businesses. By the way, often other businesses or local businesses will pay you more than a blogger will. So that is the market that I went after because they have more money. Okay?

[00:15:48.660] - Debbie
So, just want to throw that out there. You can do coaching, you can do consulting. It could be on anything. Like for me, I did design consultations, paint consultations. I did flooring consultations.

[00:16:03.610] - Debbie
If you are a nutritionist, you can help people with that, or dieting, or exercising, just whatever you're good at, organizing, staging, anything that you are good at. The possibilities are endless. You may not realize what they all are now.

[00:16:24.520] - Debbie
You may realize some in three months from now, but just get going on something. The other ideas will come to you when you become less stressed about money.

[00:16:37.390] - Debbie
Okay? How did I do it? And by the way, like I said, I had no experience doing it, but I did it the old fashioned way. I just networked. I just called people on the phone.

[00:16:52.000] - Debbie
Remember, we have phones, okay? I had no money. I couldn't even afford to go to Starbucks to meet with people. I literally just called people and I didn't ask them if I could work for them. I told them what I was able to do.

[00:17:08.140] - Debbie
I was able to get a lot of traffic from SEO on my blog. Do you know anybody else that might need help? Do you know anyone else that I might be able to help? It's a much less threatening call. You're not begging for someone to hire you.

[00:17:26.740] - Debbie
You're not begging for someone to do a little bit of stuff with you. You're simply asking them, telling them what you can do, asking them if they know anybody that might need that help. And by the way, many people don't. But you have to keep calling because eventually you will find people that do. Okay?

[00:17:47.100] - Debbie
The next step. And so many people miss this, and it is so critical. It will help you out in even evaluating what ideas you are considering. This is simple math. Do not over complicate it.

[00:18:03.120] - Debbie
You can use a calculator. You can write this on a piece of paper and figure it out. But just do the math. So, the simple math is how much do you need per month or per time period, whatever that is. How much can you charge or charge per hour or charge per unit, it's the same philosophy as you'll see, and then divide the two by each other to figure out how many units you need. If you have a goal, you will work towards that goal, and you will make it happen. All right, here's an example. So, suppose you need to make an extra $1,000 a month. How much can you charge per hour or per unit?

[00:18:54.410] - Debbie
And let's just suppose we're going to start on the lower side. It's $25 an hour. And I chose 25 because it's on the lower side, and also because it's easy math. All right? But if it's $15 an hour, that's fine.

[00:19:10.560] - Debbie
I personally charge for my services $75 an hour. But it doesn't matter. It's not the point. So, suppose you can just charge $25 an hour for what you're doing. If I need an extra $1,000 a month, that means that I need to work and get paid for 40 hours a month.

[00:19:32.440] - Debbie
That's it. 40 hours, okay? That is just 10 hours per week. Or set another way, 2 hours every work day of the week. You can space it out however you want, but that is the math.

[00:19:49.410] - Debbie
Now, if you're able to charge $50 an hour, that number is cut in half. And so, this is really important, because you are going to want to be able to charge more of a premium for whatever it is that you do. But at the same time, I'm going to tell you just to get started. Get your foot in the door. Get your feet wet.

[00:20:16.830] - Debbie
Pick a number that you feel is a good trade and good value for someone to pay you for whatever it is that you're going to do. And it's basically an easy yes offer. They will say yes to it. If that's $15 an hour, do it. If it's $25 an hour, do it.

[00:20:36.170] - Debbie
You will work your way up over time. Okay. So the next step in here, which is just a variation, is you're going to think about how you can package your service. So, you might do this in ten hour increments. Your service can be anything.

[00:20:55.680] - Debbie
It can be creating pins on Pinterest, or scheduling pins on Pinterest, or writing blog posts, whatever the heck it is, okay? But people often, unless they're hiring you to be a virtual assistant, often people won't like the idea of paying you per hour. It's hard for many of them because they don't know how many hours something is going to take. So think about packaging it. Like, it's going to take 10 hours to schedule all these pins or whatever, or do all these posts on Facebook, or do whatever it is that you're doing.

[00:21:37.060] - Debbie
And so, if I'm getting paid $25 an hour, and I'm going to do it in ten hour increments per month, that means each package is $250. And by the way, I just made up that number, $250. For easy math, your package can be $500 or $300, or you could have more than one package.

[00:22:01.180] - Debbie
And that's totally fine. But think about it from the customers' point of view, they are going to pay for something. What are they getting and how much is that going to cost them? Do it in a way that makes sense for them and makes sense for you. So, if I need $1,000 a month and I divide it by 250, that means I only need to get four customers a month.

[00:22:28.000] - Debbie
Okay, this is just in the example of I'm getting paid for my services.

[00:22:34.690] - Debbie
Use whatever breakdown makes sense for you and over time, scale up. As you get more experience, you can do things faster. You can charge more. You can either charge more to the same customer or more to future customers, or you can scale up the level of your services to get to a place that you are able to charge more per hour or you are able to use tools that will save you time, so you can basically do it in less. So, you're effectively making more per hour.

[00:23:06.650] - Debbie
All right, make sure that you can build up to your buckets with the building blocks and I will give you more examples in a second. For me, I was freelancing as I said. I was charging $75 an hour. Right away or fairly quickly, I was able to find two clients. One was paying me 8 hours a week and the other was paying me 4 hours a week.

[00:23:35.670] - Debbie
When I did the math, that came out to $3,600 a month, assuming there were four weeks in a month. Again, being conservative with the numbers because technically most months are 4.2 weeks or whatever. But then my task was to find some other way to make up an extra $400. So, I often found some one off clients that I might do something for, for let's say 2 hours.

[00:24:05.460] - Debbie
And I just had to find two of those per month.

[00:24:11.090] - Debbie
Then my other job was doing painting estimates. I basically worked on commissions only. If I didn't sell anything, I didn't make anything. So, with painting, the average job size was $4,000. My commission was 10%, which meant on average, I would make $400 per job sold. Some I made more, some I made less.

[00:24:37.050] - Debbie
Yes, it did vary week to week and a little bit month to month, but more so week to week. I probably had a close rate of around 35%. I knew on my flooring business, which was somewhat similar, my rate was around 40%, maybe 42%. So, I figured I don't know nearly as much about painting. There's more competition and painting, therefore 35% rate is reasonable.

[00:25:06.650] - Debbie
So, when I did the math for that and figured out how much I needed per month and how much I could close per month, I basically came out with I need to get 18 appointments per month or whatever that number is, divided by four to kind of say per week. It's okay if I'm off by an appointment or two on this week. As long as I make it up next week, but I can't let it go on more than that. But think about that with everything that you're doing. What is the simple math to get you to your number, just to basic division?

[00:25:45.460] - Debbie
Use a calculator. All right. So, now, in terms of the main ways that you can make money and the main ways to calculate your building blocks, ads are obviously for many of us, one of the first ways that we can make money on our blog. It is not really the most profitable way for most of us, but it's definitely one of the ways that works for many of us at an earlier stage.

[00:26:15.950] - Debbie
Okay. So, if you're making money on ads and you want to make more money from ads, figure out what your Rpm is. That could be per session or per page view. It doesn't really matter, okay. And right now, I'm recording this in December when the ad rates are kind of at their highest. And when you're listening to this, it should be January when the ad rates are typically the lowest.

[00:26:44.120] - Debbie
So, don't forget to account for that and the seasonality in there. So, if you know your Rpm and you need to make an extra $1,000 a month, just do the math. 1,000 divided by whatever your current Rpm is, that's how many incremental page views or sessions you need to make. And then figure out how you're going to get that. You know how many blog posts you're going to do, or whatever it is you're going to do to get that extra traffic.

[00:27:14.730] - Debbie
If you are selling products and doesn't really matter if this or your own shop, figure out what your average size is, or your average cart size, if you will, or how much money you're making, and then how much more you need to sell. So, if you earn, let's say, $4 on average for a product that's sold, you're going to have to sell a lot of those versus if you make 40 per product, you only need to sell like a 10th of that. Okay, but just do the math. Whatever it is, make sure you look at your profit, not just your revenue. If you're offering services, basically do it on a per project, per client, per hour basis, like I just showed you.

[00:28:03.930] - Debbie
If you're going to make more on affiliate marketing, it's basically the same as products or ads. How much are you making per affiliate sale? How much more do you need to make? If you're doing sponsored posts, how much do you get paid on average per sponsored post? How many sponsored posts you need to meet your goal? Or what can you do to raise the rate that you charge per sponsored post?

[00:28:31.800] - Debbie
Again, it's all math, and it's not that hard if you have a calculator. All right, so the five main ways to monetize and the drivers that get you there. For ad revenue, by far the easiest and most passive way to do this is through SEO traffic. That's what I have done for years. If you're making more on Pinterest or TikTok or wherever, just figure out the math and how you're going to do it. But I'd recommend SEO Traffic, hands down.

[00:29:10.750] - Debbie
All right. Affiliate marketing. The way to really drive that is either one of these three main ways. You can do all three or just one, or do two of the three, but it's SEO traffic, it's email marketing or YouTube. Those are three most effective ways by far.

[00:29:30.630] - Debbie
All right? Sponsored post is the third thing, which is basically the rate you can charge is based on traffic and social media and to some extent, the size of your email list. If you're making money on products, generally, it's your email list that drives it. So, how can you sell more to your email list? Or how can you increase the size of your email list? Or how can you increase the frequency that you email them?

[00:30:00.540] - Debbie
If you are in a marketplace, that's another place that you can drive sales, either, you know, like a place like Etsy or Ravelry or wherever, usually there, if you're already on there, it's going to be a matter of making more products. Okay. If you're not on there, consider getting on one of those if it is relevant. I actually have been selling products for many years, but now I've gone into Etsy and well, I'm not going to tell you that I'm making a ton of money. I am making good progress and my progress on that has been much faster versus if I started doing it on a non-existent email list.

[00:30:43.180] - Debbie
Okay, so if you go in a place like Etsy, you don't need to have an email list, but you can get started right away. If it's services that you offer, your drivers are going to be your clients and later, your email list from those clients or potential clients. All right, the key takeaways here, because there's only so much I can cover in this time period. But if you need money and stability right away, then my direction to you is figure out a service or some sort of active income that you can do to get money in the door quickly. Just do it.

[00:31:23.230] - Debbie
Or figure out an additional service that you can offer, so then you create another additional income stream. Be sure to treat your blog like a business. I am not telling you to invest tons of money, but definitely, there are some things, especially as you go along, that you can invest in as you go along, that will improve your efficiency. Do them because it will enable you to get more done in less time. And time is money.

[00:31:56.070] - Debbie
Especially, time is money if you are being paid essentially by the hour or by the project. So, don't be afraid to do that. Do not spend tons of money, but do spend some money, whether that's to improve your efficiency or your learning, so you can earn more. And have a plan. Those who fail to plan, fail. So that when the next one comes, even if it's larger, even if it's like $10,000, like I started to get as I went along. The larger ones are easier to take care of because you have the ability to learn how to do this, to learn how to plan.

[00:32:39.650] - Debbie
I also want to remind you that in the depression, the most number of millionaires were created. Furthermore, during depressions and recessions and whatever panics have happened over the last, I don't know, 200 years or so, some of the best companies were formed, and they are around here today. Even ones from the 18 hundreds and the early 19 hundreds, they are still here. Why? Because when there are problems, there are people that have problems and people that need solutions.

[00:33:21.740] - Debbie
Your job is just figure out how you can solve those problems. So, look at this as an opportunity, not a problem. It's a short-term setback for a long-term gain. Okay, so now what do I have for you? I have a little freebie, and this is a little printable.

[00:33:45.350] - Debbie
Actually, you can look at it on the computer or print it out, whatever makes the most sense. But it's basically seven easy ways to monetize online. So, you can quit your job, that's what it's called. But really, it doesn't matter if you have a job or you don't have a job. It's really seven easy ways to monetize online, so you can earn more and/or you can quit your job sooner.

[00:34:10.180] - Debbie
So, I hope that is helpful for you. Again. My name is Debbie Gartner. You can find my freebie down below and my website, which I forgot to mention is the flooringgirl.com. All right, I will catch you guys.

[00:34:25.720] - Debbie
Hope to see you around. Thanks so much for listening and good luck with making your goals. I know you can do it.
