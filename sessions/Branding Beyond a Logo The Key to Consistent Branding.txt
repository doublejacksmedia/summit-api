Welcome, everyone. I am so glad that you have decided to join me today for my presentation on branding beyond a logo, the key to creating consistent branding.

[00:00:19.700] - Madison
So let's get started and imagine that you are planning out your day and you need to go to the store so you get your shopping list all together. And you had to one of your favorite stores, Target. You recognize the red signage. You pull into a parking space and you walk towards the store. Now you expect to walk in and see more of that red signage, an open floor plan and lots of white space. But instead, you walk into this.

[00:00:48.970] - Madison
What is most likely to happen in this scenario? You're most likely to turn around and walk back to your car confused, maybe a little frustrated that you wasted your time and you're most likely not going to return back to this location.

[00:01:05.380] - Madison
What happened is that your expectation did not match the reality of your experience. Now, this type of experience is exactly what we want to avoid when we are attracting new people to our blog. And we want to make sure that the way that your audience is perceiving your brand is how they are also experiencing it. And this is why consistent and strategic branding is so important for bloggers. When someone comes across your brand for the first time, it is likely not on your blog at all. It might be on Pinterest or Google or maybe even on social media. Once that person takes action and hops over to your website, we want to make sure that their expectation is matching the reality of what they see on your blog.

[00:01:53.470] - Madison
So, consistent branding in this way can lead to so many great things for your blog. It can lead to five star reviews or instant feedback when you publish a new blog post, whether that is a DIY project or a travel article or a new recipe, it's going to lead to raving fans who share about your content and help you to grow your audience. It's going to help you to have competent messaging and consistent messaging, which will instantly connect you to your ideal reader. It will also give you the opportunity to create digital products that will resonate with your audience and they will actually sell. And finally, one of the most important things is that it will allow you to have the professional and reputable brand that you are hoping for. And that can lead to so many things, so many bigger opportunities for your blog, things like writing a book, launching a course, being on a TV show. There are so many opportunities that can come, but you have to first make sure that you're putting your best foot forward and you are really presenting your brand in a professional way.

[00:03:02.440] - Madison
Now, for those of you who I don't know already, my name is Madison Wetherill and I run Grace and Vine Studios. I am a Web designer and branding strategist, and we work with our clients in a couple of different ways, primarily through branding and website design. We also have a signature package called "Designer for a Day", where we hop into your blog and go through that never ending to do list of items that you have and help you fix those things up.

[00:03:28.150] - Madison
Now, I have been working with clients in this way since twenty fifteen. These are just a few examples of some of my most recent clients. And through working together with my clients, we have been able to do things like increase email subscribers, increase rankings on Google, launch incredibly niched digital products that have made five thousand dollars. But most importantly, and the thing that means the most to me when I'm working with my clients, is that we've been able to build their confidence in their brand messaging to help them connect with their ideal readers and their truest fans.

[00:04:03.640] - Madison
So, in today's presentation, I'm going to walk you through the foundations of your branding that are going to help you build consistency in your visual branding and in your messaging. As we get started and we're all getting comfortable and getting ready to dive into the topic. I would love for you to just head over to the chat, and just let me know about you and your blog. I would love to know who is tuning in live today.

[00:04:28.720] - Madison
So, let's talk about the two different sides of branding. Now, on the left, you'll see we have your visual branding. Now, this is what most people consider to be your branding. It is the things like your fonts and colors that fall into the style guide of what you present. It's going to be things like your photography style or the type of images that you use. It's going to be your actual logo design and any type of website design that you have, and then any other graphics that you're putting out there, things like Pinterest graphics, social media graphics, advertisements, all of those types of things are all going to fall under the visual side of your branding.

[00:05:09.310] - Madison
The other side of your branding that is more often forgotten and not talked and talked about is the strategy side of your branding. So, this is the thing like your nesh, what type of content you create, who your audience is and what they're struggling with, your core brand messaging, how you speak to your audience and then your core values. And these are the things that are going to be your opinions or philosophies on maybe the type of content that you share or just in general.

[00:05:42.130] - Madison
So, like I said, many people start with the visual side of their branding. First they might create. A logo on Canva, or maybe they ask a friend to do it. Maybe they hire someone really inexpensive on Fiverr. And when you get started with any new business or your blog, there's really a lot of emphasis on making it look good from the start.

[00:06:03.060] - Madison
Now, I have no issue with great looking branding and branding that puts your best foot forward. But the problem with focusing on the visual side first is that you aren't always clear about what your blog is about, and you're not clear about who you're speaking to through your blog. And it is likely that all of that work, whether it is a lot of work and money or just a little bit of work and money, is going to be quickly outgrown when you start to develop more of this brand identity and strategy for your blog. And then what what always happens is you start to try to reinvent the wheel and find something that might resonate more with you.

[00:06:42.180] - Madison
And that is what's going to lead in to inconsistency in your visual branding across platforms and in the way that you're presenting yourself. I see this a lot with my clients who come to work with me. They feel like something is off with their branding. Maybe it's not resonating with their audience or they aren't feeling confident about it. And so, they go and try to reinvent their branding through different Pinterest graphics or different social media graphics. And again, that just leads to things looking inconsistent, looking unpolished across all the different channels.

[00:07:14.550] - Madison
This is what creates that experience that we talked about at the beginning, where your audience might be expecting one thing based on a Pinterest graphic that they're clicking on. And when they get to your blog, they're experiencing something totally different and they're confused and frustrated and maybe they just go right back to Pinterest and never come back. This ultimately is not going to lead to building trust with your readers.

[00:07:42.950] - Madison
So, if you haven't downloaded the worksheet already, I would definitely encourage you to do that. And if you don't have time to download it right now, just grab a scrap sheet of paper, because we're going to be working through some of these sections together throughout this presentation. And some of these questions, I'm going to have you jot down answers to you may not know right off the top of your head, but I would encourage you to just write something down. Even if it's not the best answer or the right answer, this will get your wheels turning and you can always come back to these sections that you're stuck on later on. But you'll see throughout this presentation, that these different sections do build on each other. So, I would encourage you to just get something down, even if it's not one hundred percent. The final answer that you'll have.

[00:08:25.730] - Madison
So first, we're going to dive into your niche. Now your niche is going to actually break down into three different levels. And the first level that I want you to write down and maybe even put in the chat is what type of content do you create now? If you envision your niche being sort of like an inverted pyramid at the very top, you have kind of the widest section it's going to catch the most. So, that might be things like you create recipes or DIY projects, parenting tips, home decor, travel, etc. This is really that top level niche that is going to separate you, and it's going to start to put bloggers into different buckets of based on what they're creating.

[00:09:10.280] - Madison
So, the second level is going to be your special team. So, within the type of content that you just wrote down, what is the specific type that you are sharing? So if you're a food blogger, maybe you're sharing weeknight dinner recipes. If you're a DIY blogger, maybe you are sharing DIY farm house projects, maybe your travel blogger and you are sharing South American travel tips. You can see how we're getting more specific here and you are starting to differentiate yourself from other people within your same niche. So, food bloggers are going to start to get into more specific categories based on the specific type of recipes that they share.

[00:09:51.320] - Madison
So, this last one is the most important. And I'm going to give you a little bit more time during this section to write down a few more ideas. But this is basically this idea that I share a lot, which is if I lined up three to five people who share the exact same type of content as you do, what would be different about you in your blog? So, if I lined up five plant based food bloggers, where would you be different than the person next to you?

[00:10:20.870] - Madison
If you are a travel blogger, what makes your travel content unique and special? What experiences have you had that make you a little bit different than someone else? What values or beliefs do you have about your specific type of content? I always give this example of Melissa from Simply West, who I worked with earlier last year on her branding and website design, and she is a dairy free blogger. So, I can imagine that pyramid at the very top.

[00:10:50.570] - Madison
We would have she's a food blogger. Then the next layer is that she's a dairy free food blogger. The final layer is that one of her philosophies about cooking dairy free, is that she believes recipes should sort of naturally be dairy free and not use products that are like fake cheese or fake products that are imitation. And really she tries to rely on recipes that are just consistently dairy free, and maybe you're taking one ingredient away instead of having to add in additional things.

[00:11:22.070] - Madison
So, I'm going to give you about a minute to write down anything that's coming to mind right now. I wanted to sit on this question a little bit longer because there's often a few answers. But I want you to really think about those specific things about you, your brand. Maybe in specific ways that you make that content like I shared with the example from Melissa, because I'm going to give you about a minute to do that now. Okay, so now that we have our niche figured out, we're going to dive into the next section, which is your audience.

[00:12:47.250] - Madison
So, first thing I want to mention here is that most people, when they think about defining their audience, they immediately jump to demographics. Now, demographics are really great for helping you to visualize a specific person. They're really helpful for working with brands who are going to really care about specific demographics. But as we're thinking about our audience, I want you to be a little bit more specific with these ideas. I don't want this to be a fictional made up person or you're just kind of choosing something. I want you to really think about if you know a specific audience member that you've had conversations with, or if you know somebody in your real life who is kind of the perfect person to follow your blog because of something they're struggling with.

[00:13:28.680] - Madison
What you envision that person as we answer these questions. And when it comes to these questions, if there are things that you're not one hundred percent sure about, I would encourage you again to just write down the best answer or the thing that you think might be the right answer, because you can always touch base with your audience later and find out if these things are true. So, right now, I want you to just really lean into whatever it is that you know about your audience.

[00:13:53.190] - Madison
So, let's first talk about who are they? Who are these people? And you can talk about things like their demographics. You can talk about their family makeup or their occupation. Maybe you can talk about their past experiences. If they for example, if you're a parenting blogger and you are attracting an audience who maybe has lost a child in the past, maybe that is something that, you know specifically about them. Any type of information that you know about these people, I would encourage you to just write that down so you can start to paint the picture of who it is that's coming to your blog.

[00:14:27.950] - Madison
The next question is going to be, what is their biggest challenge when it comes to the content that you're creating? So, if you're a food blogger, what is their biggest challenge with making your recipe? And I always like to encourage people to think about what might stop them from doing your project, your recipe, whatever it is, whatever type of content you create, what is in their way of taking action on your blog post in the first place. That is often a challenge that you can address within your messaging or within your blog post content. So, I would think about what their biggest challenges are related to your content or maybe related to the rest of their life that stops them from making your content.

[00:15:13.010] - Madison
The next question is going to be, how do they spend their time? So what are their typical days, weekends, maybe their entire month? What do these look like for them? Are they spending their time chasing around kids or are they spending it in a corporate office or are they spending it traveling? Really think about what does the reality of their day look like?

[00:15:34.550] - Madison
The next part of this is what do they wish they had more time for? This is always really telling about who your audience is and what's important to them, because if you can know what they might want to spend more time on, it can help you to understand what type of content you need to create to sort of meet them where they're at. And this is really going to help you understand your audience on an intimate level and a deep level that's going to make it so easy for your content to resonate with them because you get them on a level that's more than just demographics, more than just a fictitious person. But you truly understand and can empathize in a way with the struggles and challenges that they are having.

[00:16:21.920] - Madison
Our next topic is going to be your brand messaging, so this is starting to put all of those pieces together. Now, if you're not familiar with what brand messaging is, it is basically the language that you use regularly to communicate with your audience. It can also be the tone of voice or even specific vocabulary that you use. And it really becomes your brand's personality and the heart behind your blog. So, we're going to actually develop a couple of these brand messaging points in the next slide.

[00:16:52.090] - Madison
So, I want you to think back to all the pieces that we've talked about so far and what you think about your nesh, your audience, and now we're going to put it into really easy phrases for you to remember. Now, some of these are going to be things that you actually share with your audience. Maybe it's a way that you weave in this messaging within your blog post or on social media or your email marketing as well. And some of these, are just going to be for you to keep in mind as you go and plan out your content and produce it, so that you can remember sort of what the foundation is for your brand and who you're trying to help.

[00:17:26.680] - Madison
First, is your specific type of content are blank. So your recipes are easy, your recipes are gluten free, your travel tips are for the adventurer. You can start to see how this is really going to shape what type of content you share and kind of incorporates a little bit of the why behind it as well.

[00:17:48.400] - Madison
Next is going to be your expertise. So, why are you the person to share this content? What knowledge, expertise or experience have you had to help shape your content?

[00:18:01.960] - Madison
Next, what is unique about your content? So, your recipes are unique because they use they do not use specialty ingredients. Your travel tips are unique because they focus on South America. Next, your readers struggle to blank. Again, we talked about this a little bit on- the audience slide. But what are your readers struggling to do? Are they struggling to make time for something? Are they struggling to take action on something?

[00:18:31.940] - Madison
And then finally, your readers would like to blink. This can be the time element that we talked about. So, your readers would like to spend more time taking care of themselves. Your readers would like to spend more time baking. Your readers would like to make more time for adventure. So, now we've really talked about the strategy side of your branding, we've started to lay the foundation of kind of what the visuals are going to be built upon. And so now we can start thinking about the visual side of your branding.

[00:19:07.700] - Madison
So, the first thing that we're going to talk about is brand consistency. So, I gave a couple of examples of when things start to get a little bit off track with your branding. So, typically, this is something doesn't fit or doesn't feel right about your branding. And so you go off course and try to create something new. So, the very first thing you need to do in order to check, to see if your brand is consistent across all platforms is that you first have to review what you have.

[00:19:35.480] - Madison
So, this can be as simple as taking some screenshots and putting them in a folder on your computer. If you are more tangible and you want to print these out and sort of make a board, that is a great way to do this to. You could also just open all of these things up on your computer and look at them. But you want to look at things like your logo, your website design, any Pinterest graphics that you have, your photography style and really any other graphics that you're creating, maybe just open up your Canva account and look through things. Your freebees might be a good one or even your email marketing campaign template. So, you want to kind of look at what all of these pieces look like together.

[00:20:13.760] - Madison
Then, you're going to start to evaluate. So, you want to first think about everything we've laid as the foundation, as a strategy for your brand. And you want to start to think about does your current branding work for your audience, your niche and your messaging? Does it feel in line? And this is really when you have to even if you are not a designer, you can still look at something and know whether it feels off.

[00:20:39.170] - Madison
Maybe you can explain what feels off about it yet, but you can look at a couple of pieces of your branding and then think about your audience member and think about would this resonate with my audience? Would this person be attracted to this Pinterest design? And you can start to just figure out whether these things are starting to build a great puzzle that works. Or if you're starting to see that there's some fragments in place.

[00:21:04.310] - Madison
Then you can look at the branding and see if it's visually consistent. So, are you using the same colors, the same fonts? Are you using the same overall style, like a minimalist style? Or maybe it's bright and bold and you want to just think about are these things lining up.

[00:21:22.100] - Madison
Next, you're going to document. So, I'm going to talk about this a little bit on the next slide. But this is when you really start to create a visual representation of what your branding is. Maybe when you look at everything that you have so far, you realize that your Pinterest graphics are a little bit off. So, you're going to rework those once you have this branding document in place.

[00:21:42.650] - Madison
And then last once you have evaluated everything, you've maybe redone a couple of things about your branding and you've documented it into a brand board, which, again, we'll talk about in a second. Then you can start to create templates for consistency. So, I love using Canva for this. I create all of my client graphics for them in Canva so that they can use them in the future. And this is a great way to have consistency within your templates because it's right there and built in for you.

[00:22:13.040] - Madison
So, when I talked about documenting your branding, here's an example of what I mean. This is that client I mentioned Melissa from Simply Whisked. And you can see on the left, this is her inspiration board, which we start with at the very beginning of the project. This is a great way to visually see what your brand feels like.

[00:22:33.140] - Madison
You can see that her brand is light and airy and has some subtle colors. And then what you're going to do after that, is then you can work on your logo design. So, if you are DIY in your branding right now, I have some tips for that on the next slide. But it's important to just keep it simple at the beginning. So, you have your logo design and then finally on the right. This is a brand board. So, this is a great way to maintain consistency throughout all of your different graphics. By being able to refer back to this, you can see all of your colors and the elements that you're using. And then finally, your typography, so that you can keep consistent branding and visual identity throughout all of the different pieces.

[00:23:23.770] - Madison
So, again, when you're talking about DIY, your branding, whether that's because you're not ready to work with a brand designer or you don't want to, for whatever reason, my best tips for DIY your branding is, again, to keep it simple. So, this means you want to use one or two fonts. And I typically recommend, if you're doing a logo and you're DIY it, just do one font. It's it's often hard for people who are not designers to be able to pair up fonts together. And that's not something that is a natural strength of yours generally. I would say, keeping it to one font is going to help with consistency. If you're thinking about your website design, you can pick one font for your body font and one font for your headings, and then maybe try to incorporate those fonts into your logo design.

[00:24:10.370] - Madison
When it comes to colors, you want to choose two to three colors at most. I typically recommend to do one primary color and one secondary color. And those are going to be the two colors that you're going to use the most in your graphics and your branding. It's also usually helpful to have some sort of gray color, to be an accent color without really having something that is competing against your other colors.

[00:24:34.060] - Madison
So, then again, you're going to create a brand board once you have all of these things decided. And that is going to help you be consistent across your platforms. And whatever you want to create something new, you'll be able to refer back to that brand board.

[00:24:47.650] - Madison
Now, I already mentioned the visual inspiration board. This is really my favorite way to have people really start to see the connection between their strategy that they developed and the visual side of things. And so, I actually put together a free training and inspiration board template for you. So, this is going to be a Canva template that you can download and then a video training that's going to walk you through how I teach my clients to create these inspiration boards. So, essentially teaching you how to go through Pinterest and find the right images that are going to invoke the emotion that you want to have your blog sharing.

[00:25:25.330] - Madison
And so it's going to walk you through how to create that, how to parent down to just nine images and create an inspiration board that will help you to be building that brand consistency going forward. So I would definitely encourage you to download that. You can go to GraceandVineStudios.Com/inspiration to download that file and that free training.

[00:25:47.410] - Madison
Now, I would love to stay connected with you after this presentation. I am most active over on Instagram so you can find me over there at Grace and Vine. You can head over to my website at Graceandvinestudios.com to find out how I work with clients. Again, my most common offers that we do with my clients are branding, custom website design for bloggers and our designer for a day package where we go in and fix up your website for you.

[00:26:13.300] - Madison
And then finally, if you are a Podcast junkie like I am, I would love for you to check out my podcast. It's called The Vine Podcast, and we specifically talk about strategy and design. And the audience in mind is food bloggers. And that is mostly because that is mostly who I work with. And the examples that I give are going to be food examples. But I have heard from a lot of people who have listen to the podcast who get a lot out of it, even if they are not a food blogger. So, if you are a blogger in general, we talk about things like content planning and all kinds of things that will be applicable to you as well.

[00:26:44.710] - Madison
Thank you so much for spending your time with me today. And I will definitely be hanging out in the chat to answer any questions that you guys might have. And be over in the Facebook group to connect with you there as well.
