Jessie Festa [00:00:12]:
Hey everyone, my name is Jessie Festa, and I am so excited to be here with you today to talk about how to create a paid newsletter for recurring revenue. We'll be going over a 5 step strategy that's going to take you from coming up with your newsletter idea and designing it, all the way through getting it set up, pricing it, to marketing it, to retaining members, and more. We will be covering a lot. Just a little bit about me before we get started, I started travel blogging in 2011 after graduating with my BA in communication and ultimately deciding that the 9 to 5 office life wasn't for me. I am a full time travel blogger. My blogs are Jesse on a Journey and Epicure & Culture. I'm also a blog coach with a number of courses as well as my signature travel blog prosperity membership community. If anyone else here is into travel, happy to chat.

Jessie Festa [00:01:07]:
Some of my favorite destinations have been Bhutan, Panama, Latvia, and Mongolia. I'm about to set off to Kyrgyzstan as well, very excited about that. And I believe that the best way to monetize is through helping your audience, which is exactly what we'll be going over how to do in this workshop. So before we get into the actual step by step strategy, let's just quickly talk about what a paid newsletter is, and why you should start one. So a paid newsletter is an email newsletter that subscribers pay to receive, thanks to the education, entertainment, and/or value it provides, and this is really key. Many of you are probably sending out a free newsletter, and of course, that should have value, but if people are paying you, the content really needs to go above and beyond what you are sending for free, and we'll go over how to do that, how to come up with that value. Now some benefits of starting a paid newsletter include earning recurring revenue for more predictable income. It'll also help you position yourself as an expert in your niche or your industry.

Jessie Festa [00:02:17]:
Another key benefit of starting a paid newsletter is it allows you to provide premium content to your community without ads and promotions. It also, depending on the content of your newsletter, can be relatively easy to create, and we'll look at some examples of different types of content that you can include, but it could be pretty easy, especially compared to like a premium course. Okay, so now let's talk about the strategy starting with step number 1, choose the value you'll deliver. Really think about who you help and how, and you know when you are starting, I'm a blogger, but whether you have a blog or another type of business, you'll have some type of mission statement. I help blank group of people do how you help, or some version of that, and your paid newsletter should be an extension of that so that your business is nice and cohesive. You wanna think about the problems and pain points that your audience faces, or if there's something that they're seeking from you specifically. For example, there are paid newsletters that aren't necessarily solving very specific problems, but they these people starting these newsletters have some type of following. Maybe their readers love their writing.

Jessie Festa [00:03:34]:
Now I highly recommend that you keep track of the questions that people ask you. This is direct insight into what they want from you, and I know for me, every single product and service I've ever created has come from looking at the questions that people were asking me, and I recommend you also think about how you can help solve the problems and pain points that your audience faces or make their lives better in some way through your newsletter. And to really, really, really see success with a newsletter, I recommend thinking about how you can solve a recurring information problem. I do this with my newsletter, and I'll give you this example on the next slide, but maybe you are sending a list of opportunities, leads, or deals, that's what I do for mine. Maybe your newsletter shares in-depth insights, reports, or case studies that go beyond like the free articles that exist online. Maybe it's educational content, more like a a course through a newsletter, and maybe you're even giving your newsletter subscribers feedback on their work. Maybe it's a behind the scenes look into your unique process or exclusive bonus content or early access similar to what people offer on Patreon. So here's an example of my newsletter.

Jessie Festa [00:04:55]:
I have a VIP opportunities newsletter for travel bloggers where I send 5 paid blogger opportunities to their inbox every Monday. So in terms of my mission for my business, I help travel bloggers grow their traffic and income. The problems and pain points that my audience faces include trying to monetize, time, including in terms of having time to implement strategies, and how long it takes to monetize a blog. It's it's a lot longer for most people than they think. Also, making connections. As someone who's been blogging a long time, I've been able to make a lot of connections, and I use these to add value to my newsletter either by, you know, when when someone emails me with an opportunity, I ask them, hey, can I include this in my newsletter? Newer bloggers aren't maybe getting these same emails from connections like this, but I kind of help to bridge the gap in that way. And in terms of how can you help solve the audience's problems and make people's lives easier through a newsletter, I do this by sending growth and income opportunities straight to their inbox to save them time and help them monetize faster. Now going back to that idea of solving a recurring information problem, my audience, you know, they continually need to make money to grow their business, and part of that for many blockers is looking for leads.

Jessie Festa [00:06:15]:
So again, I'm bridging that gap, and I'm helping them every Monday kind of solve this problem through that paid newsletter. Here's another example from the desk of Alicia Kennedy. Alicia has built an audience who loves her food writing, and she has a really unique approach to food writing. It's not just the typical sort of restaurant reviews and things like that, and people love it, and they want to hear from her more. So she does have a free newsletter where she sends Monday essays, but if you opt for the paid newsletter, you get additional kind of series that she does. Now we haven't got into tech yet, but she uses Substack, and you can see with Substack it's really easy to make subscribing to a paid newsletter kind of the first and foremost thing people do. When you go to the website, you have on the left that screenshot asking you to subscribe right away. If you put your email in there, it will take you to your different payment options, the limited free newsletter, or the different subscription options.

Jessie Festa [00:07:17]:
There's also that subscribe button right at the top, and if you click into one of these articles you see here on the right that is part of the paid newsletter, for example, the desk book club, that's a paid column she does for the paid newsletter. If you click that, it will prompt you to subscribe to the paid newsletter. Here's another example. This is Ashley Gets Around, and she sends her paid subscribers premium flight deals and mistake fares. She also has a limited free version of her newsletter where you get just a couple of deals, but those really, really premium ones go to her paid subscribers. Another thing to think about is, do you have products? If you do, consider what newsletter you could pitch as a natural add on or upsell to your other related digital products. This is a benefit of really keeping your business cohesive, really thinking about your mission so that everything can kind of connect and cross promote. So for example, one of my products is a brand pitch bundle.

Jessie Festa [00:08:22]:
It helps people learn how to pitch. It also helps them find brands that work with bloggers, and a natural extension of that is, hey, subscribe to this paid newsletter, and you'll get even more opportunities to work with brands. Now if you don't have a digital product, consider creating one to cross promote with the newsletter. It's another little idea there. Okay. So moving on to step 2 with our strategy, you want to design your newsletter. Think about what will it include, and with this also consider the time investment, and if it matches the amount of time you reasonably have. Because as we are talking about in this next part, how often will it go out? It maybe goes out daily, weekly, monthly, something else, but you wanna choose a schedule that is consistent above all else.

Jessie Festa [00:09:11]:
That is what is most important. If you're telling people it's going to go out weekly and then you have weeks that you're missing, that's going to be a really, really bad user experience. Also, how much will it cost? According to Convertkit, the average price of a paid newsletter is $11 per month, and the range is typically $5 per month to $40 plus per month. So let's do a little math determining your potential revenue. So according to Convertkit, a 5% free to paid conversion rate is a good general rule for a well nurtured list. So if you charge that average $11 per month for your newsletter and you currently have 1,000 email subscribers, you can expect to onboard about 50 paid subscribers and earn about $550. Now because we're thinking about this conversion rate here, it can be helpful to build a following first. If you already have a 1,000, a few 1,000, 10000 plus subscribers on your email list and they're well nurtured, and they already love your free content, you're going to most likely get more subscribers onto that paid newsletter and make more money.

Jessie Festa [00:10:26]:
Also, consider ways to increase your base price of your paid newsletter. Just because you are charging, you know, $11 per month for your newsletter doesn't mean that's all that you can make per subscriber. For example, here is chef Dimalphy who offers her audience a new cookbook every month, and it's $10 per month for the paid subscribers. Now, if you don't want to subscribe to her newsletter, you can also purchase back issues for $15 each. So she sells her back issues as standalone products, which is genius. A few other pricing tips. The larger the impact you make on someone's life, typically the more they're willing to pay. So for me with my newsletter, people subscribing are hopefully the goal is for them to make money.

Jessie Festa [00:11:20]:
So it's a clear, you know, I'm gonna pay 9.99 a month, but hopefully I'm gonna make much more than that back from the newsletter. It can just make it an easier sell. Also consider offering a discounted annual plan to help increase retention. We'll talk more about this as we go on, but it's just a great way to have people commit to the year instead of every month thinking about, oh, should I stay a paying member or not? You might also offer a free version or a free trial to allow new readers to get to know you, give them a little taste of your work. So I offer, you can see on the right, a 2 week free trial, but you might also have a paid version of your newsletter, and then a sample of that exact newsletter can go to the free subscriber, so they can really see what they're gonna get. You might also include affiliate links where relevant and helpful. Just make sure that you always disclose when you do this, and just really make sure you're only including affiliate links where it truly makes sense and to brands and products that you truly love and think your audience would love. Now building on this idea of affiliate marketing in the newsletter, consider having a footer or a link to a resource list with recommended resources using affiliate links.

Jessie Festa [00:12:33]:
For me, I have it's jessieonajourney.com/tools. It's my recommended tools and resources for bloggers. I share this with everyone, whether you join one of my courses, my paid newsletter, my free newsletter. In the welcome email, I'm sharing that link. Okay. Moving on to step 3, you wanna choose your tech. So I have a few options here. Option 1, maybe you use your current email marketing platform, and you just have a PayPal button and a specified group in your email marketing system.

Jessie Festa [00:13:05]:
This is what I do. So I have my VIP opportunities newsletter group, and they pay with the PayPal button on my sales page. So for this, your fees include the PayPal fees and your email marketing platform fees, though you can also choose a free platform, or you can use a built in payment button within your own email marketing clients. So for example, if you use, let's say, MailerLite Classic, it's $10 per month for a Sites Pro add on, which you'll have to purchase to use their built in buttons, and then you would just pay Stripe fees, and they do have a free plan for up to 12,000 monthly emails, or maybe you use Convertkit. For that, you'll pay a 3.5% plus 30¢ processing fee per transaction, and they have a free plan for up to 1,000 subscribers. Now your other option is to use a service like Substack, very popular for paid newsletters. That is free, but once you start charging your subscribers, they take 10% in addition to credit card transaction fees. Substack is also easy to use and doesn't require a website.

Jessie Festa [00:14:14]:
They help kind of set up that that website set up for you. As you can see on the right there, going back to from the desk of Alicia Kennedy, she has a Substack site where they're really prompting people to join that paid newsletter. It's also great for writing, but it is not necessarily great for your email marketing strategies like sales funnels and automations. Substack also has a number of tools that can make it easy to grow your paid newsletter, like recommendations for you and other Substack creators can recommend each other. There's cross posting on Substack and subscriber referrals where you can reward your subscribers for bringing you new paid newsletter subscribers. Okay. Moving on to step 4, marketing your newsletter. For many, this can be the trickiest part, but to start you want to create a sales page or a form that creates excitement and sets expectations.

Jessie Festa [00:15:09]:
What do people get, how often, and why is it beneficial? And I love this example from grants for creators in their why subscribe paragraph. Grants for creators is a monthly newsletter curating grants and other funding opportunities for creators, founders, and small business owners. Grants featured are US based only, really setting those expectations. While free subscribers access a handful of featured grants monthly, paid subscribers get access to our full newsletter with a 100 plus awards and additional playlists we create for disabled persons, podcasters, filmmakers, journalists, and more. Now once you have this set up, you want to make sure to promote this sales page or form everywhere. Some ideas in your website's main menu or in a banner at the top, your link in bio on social media, also in your social media content, in your email signature or in ads, maybe you do promoted pins or Facebook ads or Instagram ads. You might also cross promote with others in your niche. Also, automation sequences sent to your subscribers and customers, and as part of your regular content plan across your digital touch points, think about everywhere that you're creating content, your blog, your free email newsletter, YouTube, social media.

Jessie Festa [00:16:29]:
Maybe you again have products for your email and customers. Make sure everyone knows about your paid newsletter and why it is so great. Now here's an idea, position your paid newsletter as a logical next step to viewing your content like in your free newsletters. So going back to grants for creators, they have a limited free newsletter where they send a few grants, but it's not the full library of grants that they offer, but they give people a taste of what the paid newsletter will provide. The way I do this, you can see in the screenshot on the left is I will share strategies and then have a call to action to the paid newsletter. So this email was which affiliate program is the best one for travel bloggers, and then the PS of that email, want help finding high paying affiliate programs and other paid opportunities, join my VIP opportunities newsletter, and, hey, it has a 2 week free trial. On the right here, Ashley gets around, sent an email where she accidentally shared what would usually be a premium deal for her paid newsletter subscribers with her free newsletter subscribers. So again, giving them a taste of what they could expect, and then she has the button call to action, join premium here.

Jessie Festa [00:17:44]:
Just a few marketing ideas for you there. And finally, we are on step number 5, work to retain subscribers. It's not just about getting new paid subscribers into your newsletter, but you want to keep the ones who have already said that they wanted this content. According to Convertkit, the churn rate that you want to aim for is 4% or below. If you're higher than that, it's an indication that you're gonna wanna look at your newsletter content and think about where there might be a disconnect, where people might not be getting what they thought they wanted, or maybe the value just isn't there, and you're gonna need to tweak some things. To help figure these disconnects out and just make the newsletter as amazing as it can be, ask for feedback from your subscribers and actually implement it, and pay attention to what emails and links are getting read and clicked, or what other important actions people are taking or not taking. For example, Alicia Kennedy, we've talked about her a few times, started out by sharing interviews, then switched to recipes based on what her subscribers wanted as well as her long term goals. I learned that by reading an interview with her that she has on her website.

Jessie Festa [00:19:04]:
Finally, offer incentives to your subscribers to encourage them to stay a member such as a discounted annual plan, and this screenshot is from Alicia Kennedy's own paid newsletter. This way people are committing to the year versus every month kind of thinking about if they want to stay a member. Alright, now I hope you enjoyed this workshop.
