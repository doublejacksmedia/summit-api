[00:00:00.000] - Liz Stapleton, Host
All right, guys. I'm really excited for this next session of the Blogger Breakthrough Summit. I'm super excited to have Lynn Neville here, a Business Growth Strategist, here to share her expertise on enhancing your blogging strategy through smart content creation and dynamic collaborations because it's always better to work smarter, not harder. Lynn, welcome. I'm super excited that you're here.

[00:00:33.970] - Lynn Neville
Thanks for having me. I'm super excited to be here.

[00:00:37.130] - Liz
Yeah. So, what are we going to be focusing on? Because I know we've titled this, Leveraging Done-For-You Content and Buzzworthy Collaborations. That can encompass a lot. So what's our focus today?

[00:00:50.040] - Lynn
Yeah. So, today I'm going to be sharing how utilizing done-for-you content can significantly cut down on the time that you spend writing and planning, and how thoughtful collaborations can amplify the content that you've created, and the impact that it makes. 

[00:01:05.630] - Liz
Okay. Let's take a step back and make sure everyone understands what we're saying when you say done-for-you content.

[00:01:12.640] - Lynn
So, done-for-you content or it's also known as PLR, which stands for Private Label Rights, is content that's essentially pre-created material that bloggers can purchase and then legally customize and publish as their own. And so that means that you can take that content, you can edit it, you can transform it, and you can publish it as if you wrote it yourself. So, it's like a cheat, but it's actually legal. So, think about it as having a team of writers assisting you behind the scenes. So, for instance, common forms of done-for-you content for bloggers include blog posts, email sequences, social media posts, and even e-books, which you can tailor to fit your brand and your audience. And using done-for-you content can be really transformative in terms of efficiency. For instance, a survey by the... I'm going to throw some stats at you. The survey by the Content Marketing Institute revealed that content creation time was cut by over 30% when using curated or licensed content. And for bloggers, that's a huge chunk. So, for busy bloggers, this means maintaining an active and consistent posting schedule really becomes so much less daunting.

[00:02:21.770] - Lynn
And with done-for-you content, you're not just starting from a blank page. I've stared at so many blank pages. I'm like, 'What am I supposed to write about?' So, with done-for-you content, you're given a foundation that you can quickly personalize with your unique insights and branding, and that really accelerates the content creation process. So, if you want to hear about a client of mine?

[00:02:44.090] - Liz
Um, yeah. Just one second, though. I want to take a step back because you specifically said curated and licensed because quality matters. So, how do you curate good, done-for-you content sources, I guess?

[00:02:58.420] - Lynn
Yeah, there's a lot of crap out there. So, if you were just to Google PLR or done-for-you content, a lot of crap shows up. What I recommend, and something I didn't mention when you were introducing me was that I was a wellness and fitness blogger. I'm an avid CrossFitter. I did all the group fitness training. And so as a former blogger, I know what it's like to spend all that time trying to create your own content. And you know your style. You have your own style. You have your own way of communicating with your audience. So, when you're curating done-for-you content, you want to make sure that that content fits your audience. It's exactly what they're going to be looking for. So, if I'm writing about CrossFit and I find done-for-you content that talks about something not involving CrossFit at all, then you're not doing your job curating the right kind of content. You want to make sure the subject matter is on point with your audience, that it is something that you can transform into your own personal voice and your own personal brand, and that is quality.

[00:03:58.870] - Lynn
So, there's a lot of done-for-you content out there, it's plagiarism, basically. It's been used so many times, and I'll talk a little bit more about how to steer away from that, but it's even used so many times that it's not you. No matter how much personalization you put in there, everyone else has used it. Those are just a few things.

[00:04:20.120] - Liz
Okay, which then brings me to the next point of keeping content authentic. So, taking that PLR done-for-you content and making it your own. So, how do you do that and maintain that authenticity?

[00:04:35.980] - Lynn
Yeah, so absolutely. Personalization is where the magic really happens. It's all about transforming that base content, the one that you purchase into something that feels uniquely yours. So, by infusing your own stories, your expertise, and your voice, you create a connection with your audience that goes way beyond just sharing information. So, personalized content can improve reader engagement and potentially increase conversion rate, which is what we all want for any calls to action that you have within your blog. So, even thinking about just the calls to action themselves. When you buy curated content that has generalized calls to action, you can personalize it by putting in your specific calls to action - whether it's to book a call with you, whether it's to sign up for a coaching session, or it could be even follow this link to see related articles on your blog. So, simple calls to action can personalize your content. And then here's a little nugget of wisdom. Consistency doesn't just keep your readers engaged. It's also gold for your SEO efforts, right? And bloggers are all about SEO. So, search engines love regularly updated content in your audience would too.

[00:05:41.260] - Lynn
They'll come to rely on your blog as a consistent source of valuable insights, which keeps them coming back for more. And when you have that done-for-your content, it makes it so much easier to stay consistent with your content creation. So, ways to personalize your done-for-your content so that it resonates with your brand. Here's a couple of tips. So first, inject your style. Don't just copy and paste done-for-you content. You want to adapt the tone to match the way that you communicate with your audience. And so, if you're humorous, add a joke or two. If you're inspirational, then you want to weave in typical motivational insights that you provide. And then two, share personal anecdotes. So again, really personalize that content that you've been given as a base. So, relate the content to your own experiences. This not only adds authenticity but also differentiates your post from anyone else that's using the same done-for-you content.

[00:06:36.000] - Liz
No, I like that. All right. So, I love that spin on how to make it authentic and your own. Before we dive into collaborations, what are some things people should be thinking about or that you want to ask that they do?

[00:06:51.760] - Lynn
Yeah. So, one question I ask all the time is, and specifically for those of you watching this, have you used done-for-you content in a particularly creative or innovative way to grow your business? And I have a couple of success stories to share as well. But I would love to hear. I'm going to be coming back to this chat throughout the duration of the Summit. So, if anyone drops any thoughts in here, I'd love to hear them. So, one of my favorite success stories involves a food blogger named Maria. She specialized in vegan recipes, but she was struggling to keep up with the demand for new content. Big struggle that all of us bloggers have. So, she purchased a bundle of done-for-you content, focusing on vegan meal plans but wanted to do something really unique with it. And I love that. So, instead of just posting the meal plans as they were, what she did was she created a challenge around them. So, she did a 30-day vegan voyager program where she used the meal plans as a base for a community experience. And participants would sign up to receive the daily emails with the meal plan for the day.

[00:07:52.720] - Lynn
But she personalized it with her specific tips and tricks for making the meals, and a link to a private Facebook group where everyone could share their creations. So, you've got that built-in community engagement right there. And so, what she also did was she added her own cultural flair for each of the meal plans. So, vegan recipes, that was the done-for-you content. She infused the recipes with her Hispanic heritage. I love that, what she did there. So, it not only personalized the content, but it also catered to an audience that was really eager for culturally diverse vegan options. So, the result, her email list grew by 50% in just one month in the 30-day challenge. And her website traffic doubled because participants were checking in daily for the tips. And most importantly, the sense of community and engagement skyrocketed. So, her blog turned into a vibrant hub for vegan enthusiasts and those curious about the lifestyle. And a lot of the participants, they actually remained active community members even after the challenge. So, the things that you could do with done-for-you content when you really get creative.

[00:08:56.930] - Liz
Yes. No, I love that. Okay, so that's done-for-you content. We're also going to talk about collaborations, which I clearly love. I do a summit every single year, and I always aim to have at least 50 speakers, which makes me crazy. But can you elaborate on different types of collaborations? You don't have to do a 50 person summit, I swear. Like I said, I'm just crazy. So, collaborations that can save time, create buzz, and maybe give us some examples.

[00:09:28.480] - Lynn
Yeah. I actually run bundles, which are similar to the Summit. My last one was 230 contributors. I'm like, we're nuts. You and I are both nuts. Okay. So, collaborations come in many forms, as you know. But some of the most effective for bloggers in particular are, and I'm just going to name a couple, guest posting and co-hosting webinars or live events. For example, guest posting on a popular blog in your niche can give you access to an established audience, which can be a huge time saver in terms of audience growth, because you're borrowing that person's already existing audience and getting in front of an already warm audience. Co-hosting a webinar allows you to share the workload and the spotlight, which offers valuable content while increasing your visibility. So, when you're running a co-hosting webinar with someone, they may have knowledge that you don't have in particular. So, the two of you bring your joint knowledge in front of an audience that is warmed up and ready to hear it, it would be adding value that you wouldn't have to provide to them. So, let me give you a real-life example to illustrate the power of smart collaboration.

[00:10:34.570] - Lynn
So, remember, Maria, the food blogger who specialized in the vegan recipes? Well, we arranged for her to guest blog on a well-known wellness site, and she also co-hosted a virtual cooking workshop with them. So, the guest post alone brought her a blog boost of 30% in traffic. And the workshop, it was an absolute hit. So, she reached hundreds of live viewers and even more in the replays, leading to a huge increase in her blog subscribers and course signups. So, it wasn't just the subscribers coming in, but it was also the sales that she was making through the course that she was offering. So, this wasn't just about tapping into someone else's audience. It was about finding a community that resonated with her message. And the collaboration was a win-win that turned into a quarterly event, steadily growing her brand visibility and establishing her as the go-to-expert in Hispanic-style vegan and cooking.

[00:11:29.210] - Liz
Yeah. So when you're talking about collaborations, just to recap what you said right? There's the benefit of you're getting in front of someone's audience, you're hopefully drawing them to your site, getting new subscribers, and new sales, but the non-tangibles, building your authority. More people are seeing you. A tangible techy back thing is backlinks always help SEO. Have we missed anything about the benefits of collaborating?

[00:11:54.320] - Lynn
Yeah. So, collaborations aren't just about getting your name out there. And I was going to mention the whole backlinks thing. So, for anyone who doesn't know, I'm sure everybody here knows watching this, the backlinks are links from other websites coming back to your blog. And search engines love backlinks. So, when you're collaborating, especially doing a guest blog post with someone else, then your content is going on their website. And you usually have a section in there that talks about your little bio and where they can find your link to your website. So, that's creating a backlink automatically back to your website, to your blog. The collaborations are also like a vote of confidence in your content, which can help boost your SEO. Second, there's the credibility boost, which you mentioned. So, when you're seen with well-respected peers, just like with a summit, because I'm being seen with other well-respected peers, it gives me a little bit of visibility and a credibility boost. So, same thing when you're doing a guest blog post or you're doing a joint webinar with somebody else. That credibility rubs off on you.

[00:12:58.020] - Lynn
So, it's like getting an instant stamp of approval that says, 'Hey, this blogger really knows their stuff.' And then don't forget about the content reach. So, when you collaborate with another blogger, you're not just reaching your audience, but also your collaborator's - when I was mentioning you're borrowing their audience. So, what you're doing is that you're effectively doubling your visibility. So, imagine one of your posts gets shared across their social networks or their newsletters. And we're talking here about really an exponential exposure here. But it's not just about what you get. You have to think about collaboration. It's also about what you give. So, you bring your unique insight to new audiences who may become loyal fans of your work. And it's really a beautiful synergy where everyone involved, you, your collaborator, and both of your audiences benefit. So, collaborations to me are always a multiplier of marketing efforts.

[00:13:48.990] - Liz
Yes, I love collaborating. I feel like that's actually been the primary driver of my business growth since I started with collaborations. My first guest post, I didn't even know what a guest post was, I didn't realize that that's what I was doing, but it worked. I was like, 'Oh, my gosh, I got 42 people to my site.' I was like a baby blogger. And so, yeah. No, it's each. And then that guest post ended up... She wrote a book and she included that guest post in her book. So, you never know where those collaboration things will take you. And I always think it's really cool that my first guest post ended up in a book.

[00:14:21.270] - Lynn
That's awesome.

[00:14:23.770] - Liz
Okay. Collaborations can be amazing, and they're so awesome. But I've also seen some really bad attempts at collaborations. What do you think are the biggest or most common mistakes people make when it comes to trying to collaborate or being part of a collaboration?

[00:14:42.910] - Lynn
Yeah. So, many jump in without a strategy and they're just seeking any collaboration instead of finding the right one. So, the best collaborations align with your values and offer your readers real benefits. It's not just about growing your reach, it's about growing your community. So, a couple of things that you want to make sure you have in place before seeking out other collaborations is making sure you have the same values, and that you are sharing the same information. I wouldn't want to collaborate with someone who I don't like their style, I don't like how they communicate with their audience. You want to make sure that you're vibing together, you have similar values. And then the other thing is you want to make sure you have a shared target audience. So, if my audience was 50 and older and your audience is 20 to 30 years old, it's not really a shared audience. They may not be interested in the same kind of topic. Those are a couple of things that many bloggers out there make mistakes for in terms of collaborations.

[00:15:42.240] - Liz
Yes. And trying to spam them, I'd say, is like another one. I don't know if you see that a lot. I feel like I see a lot of spammy... Again, it's people just being - anything and everything. So yeah.

[00:15:57.380] - Lynn
Yes.

[00:15:58.980] - Liz
So, because of the spam and all the things, it can be really challenging to find quality collaborations, and the right people to partner with. What's your strategy for identifying potential collaborators who align with you and your vibe? Any best practices you have or tips for that?

[00:16:20.650] - Lynn
Yeah. So, identifying the right collaborators starts with clarity on your own brand values and understanding your audience deeply. So, you really need to know your audience. You're not just throwing information out there hoping something sticks. You want to look for potential partners who share a similar audience demographic, like I said, and who have values that resonate with your brand, again, like I said. And before reaching out, engage with their content. This is a relationship that you're trying to form, not just one-off. If you think about just the guest blog post thing, this is my one time I'm going to guest blog post. No, you're building a relationship with them. There might be other kinds of collaborations that you can do with them down the road. So, you want to make sure you're building a relationship. So, before reaching out to someone to ask them for collaboration, you want to engage with their content. You want to understand their message. You want to make sure that there's a synergy between what you both can offer. So, think about if you found someone on Instagram, you have a similar target audience, you have the same values, and you want to collaborate with them, but you haven't followed, you haven't read their post, you don't know anything about them, and then you blindly spam them with a request.

[00:17:26.040] - Lynn
'I'd love to collaborate with you. This is what I want. This is what I want.' That's not building a relationship. You're asking for me, me, me. They're not going to say yes. They're not even going to respond to your request. So, make sure that you're trying to build that relationship. And for best practices, clear communication from the start is crucial. You want to set expectations. You want to define rules. You want to agree on outcomes. So, when I have someone do it, I actually have a form they have to fill out if they want to do a guest blog post for me. And so it's me being able to vet them and make sure that they can write in a way that my audience would like to hear, and also that the topic that they want to propose matches with what my audience is looking for. So, you always want to enter collaborations with a mindset of mutual benefit, meaning what value can you bring to them and vice versa. So, when we were talking about this before we hit record - about the podcast being on a podcast - when you pitch someone to be on a podcast, say you just wrote this amazing blog post, and you want to get it out into someone else's podcast. You pitch them and you say, 'I really think I should be on your podcast.' That kind of thing.

[00:18:35.440] - Lynn
And you're not providing any value to them. You're only in that in email when you pitch to them, it's me, I, I, I, I, I, me, nothing about their audience, about the value that you bring to them, about how it can grow their podcast followers. That's not how it works. So, just a few things to think about.

[00:18:54.580] - Liz
Yeah. I have a feeling if my email to you to participate in the Summit had been like that, I would not have gotten a yes. Instead, I was like, 'Hey, this is how my Summit is a little different. We can figure out the right people to get you in front of. And this is how the process looks.' And hopefully, you felt very supported in the onboarding and you had everything you needed.

[00:19:14.842] - Lynn
I did.

[00:19:15.130] - Liz
It makes a big difference. And pay attention, guys, because like you said, you have a form for guest post bloggers. I have a guest post page where it's like, 'Hey, if you want to pitch me, here's the subject line you need to use, and here's what your email needs to include.' And if stuff doesn't have that, I don't respond. I don't bother. I'm like, 'If you can't even do the bare minimum of Googling my site and the phrase guest posts, no.' So, just pay attention, and dig a little deeper. I do that when I'm looking for people to pitch. I'm pitching speakers, guys, right? Yeah, I had speaker applications, but I also pitch speakers, and I have for every single year that this Summit has run. And when I go, I check out their website. I look at their About page. I look at their blog post. I see what they're an expert in. I'm not necessarily looking at, 'Oh, do they have a bunch of Instagram followers?' Because I don't particularly care. If they know their subject well, and I feel like the audience could benefit them, then I'm like, 'Yes, that's a good fit.' And we all grow together. The speakers we've had as part of the Summit, I've always love when I get someone returning because it means it was a great collaboration. So, yeah, my two cents on that front. I don't know if you want to add to any of that. 

[00:20:38.990] - Lynn
It's so funny because I was going to ask you that same exact question. What's your take on collaborations, especially in the blogging world? And there really is a finesse to building those relationships and to not even calling it pitching, but just seeking that kind of synergy with somebody else. And if it's all about me, me, me, and not about that other person, they're not going to be calling you back. If you're doing it right, if you're following the finesse and you built that, you know, the muscles for asking for collaborations, you're going to get people asking you to collaborate with them instead of you having to pitch. I mean, Liz, I'm sure you get requests all the time to be in other people's events. And so, that's what happens when you're doing this the right way, right?

[00:21:20.540] - Liz
 I don't actually get a lot. I would definitely be into get some more. But yeah. Yeah, no, but I do. Right? And it's because you get involved and it grows upon each other. It becomes an exponential thing, right? Because you're in this Summit with our other incredible speakers who maybe you hadn't collaborated with, and now you have something in common. And so when you reach out or they reach out to you, they'll be like, 'Hey, I saw you were also part of this.' And you can be like, 'Liz was awful or Liz was awesome. What did you think?' And say I'd love to work with you or whatever. It gives you common ground that maybe it would have made it a little more awkward to reach out or to establish that point of trust almost. So, okay. 

[00:22:10.100] - Lynn
Not to say don't do it. I mean, no matter what stage of your blogging journey you're in, don't be afraid. Don't be afraid to ask, because more often than not, that person that you want to reach out to is looking for collaborations too. So, don't be afraid to go and ask that question, invite that person to a collaboration.

[00:22:31.640] - Liz
Yeah, and I feel like especially with guest blogging because I see it all the time or I felt it when I was a new blogger. I was so nervous to pitch a guest post. But the reality is they don't always have time to write a post. You're giving them a piece of content. That is amazing. That's perfect for when they want to go on vacation. I see a lot of bloggers, women do it setting it up for maternity leave, is getting a bunch of guest bloggers so they can schedule out that content so they're not having to create all of it ahead of time. If it's a good collaboration it is truly mutually beneficial to both parties. So, it's a win-win. Think of it that way. I did want to ask, which we didn't really talk about, but when you're using collaboration, done-for-you content and stuff, that's a lot going on. Do you have any tips on keeping organized or systemizing to make sure you're being consistent with collaborating and content and whatnot?

[00:23:28.640] - Lynn
Yeah. So, just action steps that people should take.

[00:23:33.060] - Liz
Sure. Yeah.

[00:23:34.620] - Lynn
Yeah. So, four things I want to share with you guys. So, scouting for the right content provider, going back to what we were talking about, and making sure you're curating the right content. So, you want to begin by pinpointing a done-for-you content source that meshes well with your niche. So, when you go and Google, done-for-you blogging content for whatever your niche is make sure that you are pinpointing a content source that meshes well with your niche. And this isn't just about grabbing any kind of content. It's about finding material that speaks to your audience as if you wrote it yourself, as if you crafted it yourself. Whether it's a blog post, an email, or an ebook template, make sure that it's something that anyone looking at it would think it was written by you, from scratch. Second, make it your own. So, once you've got that content, it's time to really sprinkle in a little bit of your own magic. So, you want to adapt it to mirror your unique style and your voice. You can think of it as the prefab houses. So, taking that prefab house and adding your own cozy touches to turn it into a home. Wouldn't work well for me because I'm not an interior designer or you shouldn't look...Don't look. Don't look at it!

[00:24:42.210] - Lynn
 Third, identify ideal collaboration partners. So, create a list of potential partners who not only share your target audience, but also reflect your values and your brand style. So, then craft a proposal that's so tailored to them that they can't help but say yes. So, a proposal that just exudes - 'I love you. I've read your blog post on this, or I've listened to your podcast on this, and I absolutely love it. And I know my audience will love it too. They would love any information that you could provide.' So that, yes, they're going to say yes, they're going to want to say yes. And then fourth, track and tweak. This is really important. You can do all the stuff but not know what the results are. So, make sure that after you put your content and your collaborations out there, keep a close eye on how they perform. So, things you want to look at - metrics that you want to look at - traffic, engagement, and those conversion rates to gauge the success of using them for your content and collaborations, because it's all about learning and improving. So track those results.

[00:25:43.280] - Lynn
I know it's a pain in the butt sometimes, but you want to make sure you track those results, and then that way you can fine-tune your methods for even better outcomes the next time around.

[00:25:50.970] - Liz
Absolutely. Okay, I love that. And I know you've got some stuff to tell people about, to direct them to. Do you want to...Tell them what is linked below.

[00:26:02.150] - Lynn
Yep. So, in the link below you can grab my guide, the 30 Ways to Grow and Scale Your Business Through Collaborations. It's designed to give you a clear roadmap for leveraging collaborations to the fullest. So, I had a workshop recently and I focused on just two of the strategies that were mentioned in the guide. And the participants told me how they appreciated the clear and actionable steps. And one of the attendees, actually, implemented two of the strategies as well, and they saw a 20% increase in their collaboration within a month. So, that means people were reaching out to them to collaborate with them 20% more than they had been before. So, the guide has really quality advice. I'm all about simple, strategic strategies that can lead to real results and not just more noise. So, the guide can help you to start building a more engaged and expansive community around your blog, which is what we all want.

[00:26:55.160] - Liz
