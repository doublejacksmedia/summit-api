Liz Stapleton [00:00:00]:
Guys, I'm excited for this session with Kelly from Freedom in a Budget. Kelly, welcome, and thank you for doing this.

Kelly Smith [00:00:05]:
Thank you for having me. I'm excited.

Liz Stapleton [00:00:07]:
Yeah. Because we're gonna be talking about YouTube Mhmm. For people that are really just starting to dip their toys in the water. Can you give us a little bit about your background and sort of what what we're gonna learn today?

Kelly Smith [00:00:20]:
Yeah. I had no YouTube background when I started. I hadn't didn't know how to turn on my camera. In fact, I used my phone, for about 3 years up until I hit 20,000 subscribers, and I finally upgraded to a camera, but I didn't know how to edit. I didn't know how to do thumbnails. I didn't know how to do graphics. I didn't know how to do anything, and I just learned through trial and error. I've been on YouTube for almost 4 years now.

Liz Stapleton [00:00:46]:
Okay.

Kelly Smith [00:00:46]:
It'll be 4 years in April. So I've learned a lot of the things to do and the things not to do. So, hopefully, we can kinda work on the things to do, and you don't have to go through all the struggles that I did.

Liz Stapleton [00:00:58]:
Yes. Yes. It's a lot of I feel like a lot of times when we're Blogger giving, like, advice for, like, and here's the the mistake I made, avoid it. Yeah. Please.

Kelly Smith [00:01:08]:
Yes. Yes.

Liz Stapleton [00:01:10]:
Yeah. Because you you've you've been on YouTube over 4 years. You've got over 20,000. How many I mean, I forgot how many you have.

Kelly Smith [00:01:16]:
Now, I think I'm at 32,000.

Liz Stapleton [00:01:18]:
Yeah. Which is I mean, that's like half of a football stadium. That's a lot of people. Maybe more anyway. But yeah. So really excited to learn from you. I kinda dipped my toes in water and still not you know, I'm still learning because I haven't been consistent. So can you let's maybe start with sort of what are the elements of a YouTube channel? Talk about videos and editing, you know, thumbnails, and there's cards and tags.

Liz Stapleton [00:01:49]:
You know, so let's kinda start with, like, breaking down. You've started the channel, which all you need is your email address. You maybe named it. What do you do next?

Kelly Smith [00:01:58]:
First thing, and this is, like tip number 1 that seems so basic, but I have clients that will talk me like, alright, I'm gonna go film videos, and then they film videos like this, like you would on Instagram stories, but you have to film them horizontal. You need to do everything in landscape mode. That is, like, rule number 1 because, otherwise, you're gonna have the ugly black bars made to either side. Okay. So that's that's number 1. Then just parts of YouTube is, so you have your thumbnail, you have your actual video, you have your title. You always wanna make sure that you're thinking of your title and your thumbnail before you even start thinking about your video and filming your video because you want to have that incorporated all into it.

Liz Stapleton [00:02:41]:
Okay.

Kelly Smith [00:02:42]:
Then you have your description, which is how you can help yourself to rank in SEO. It helps your promote your video. It helps you kind of explain what's going on the video. If you have links that go with the video, like affiliate marketing links, then you can put those in as well. And your disclosure? And your disclosure. Yes. Definitely. Disclosure.

Kelly Smith [00:03:02]:
Your disclosure, social media links, all of that. Then you have your tags, and tags are also what's gonna help with ranking in SEO. And I have some strategies that I can help with you guys with that as well. Then you have end screens, which are a great way to to promote your next video and keep them on the viewing session. That's huge in YouTube is you wanna keep people on the platform, and the best way to do that is to keep them on your videos so that they're not clicking on other people. So you can use that with end screens and some strategies with that. I cards, I don't usually use I cards too much anymore. They're kind of going out of kind of style on YouTube.

Kelly Smith [00:03:44]:
But Okay. The basics.

Liz Stapleton [00:03:47]:
Okay. So that's the basics, and I I wanted to get into those a little bit more. But, so that's resharing with your videos. But there's things you need to you you should probably do on your channel. Right? Is there there's, like, an about section. Mhmm. And what extent should you be doing that, having, like, a background image for your channel header? You know? Mhmm. Where you know, to what extent do you need to do that, and what should you be doing?

Kelly Smith [00:04:12]:
Yeah. You definitely want to, you know, create an about section. You want to and that can just be a quick little bio, and it can change over time. Yeah. When I started

Liz Stapleton [00:04:23]:
Sorry. That's okay. Would it be similar to, like, the about page on your blog? But

Kelly Smith [00:04:27]:
Yes. Yep. Just kind of explaining your story, what your channel is all about, why you started on YouTube maybe, whatever it may be, and then as your channel changes and progresses because most likely it will, most likely you're gonna pivot at some point, then you can change you can update it. It's not set in stone. And then your channel banner, your profile picture, that's all part of it.

Liz Stapleton [00:04:49]:
Do you recommend your profile picture and banner, either or, having your face versus your logo? What's your

Kelly Smith [00:04:56]:
That's a personal decision. I personally use my face. I like that. I don't know. I just feel like it's more personal, especially, you know, down in the comments section that they can kind of put a face to face to a name and just kind of see that I am a real person and not, you know, a robot, especially when you get into comments of people just being people on the Internet and typing comments. It can be like, oh, this girl, she knows what she's talking about. She's legit.

Liz Stapleton [00:05:22]:
Nice. Okay. So let's get back to some of the other things you had mentioned. Is there do you have any sort of strategies in deciding on a title? Have you found that certain titles do well for big news?

Kelly Smith [00:05:37]:
Yeah. You have to you know, it's all SEO, and I've definitely gotten better at it than when I first started. I didn't even know what SEO was, and so it's definitely, you know, learning what you're gonna rank for, learning how to pick terms that aren't gonna be too competitive. There are tools like TubeBuddy, and I'll have that in my freebie, a discount for you guys. But TubeBuddy is an awesome tool that'll help tell you where you're ranking in these search terms, and also give you suggested ones. So you may not rank in this one, but try this one, and then it also will give you keywords to put in your description, to put in the first three minutes of your video. You wanna have a lot of keywords, because the AI of Google, they listen to our videos, they know what we're saying, and so that's another way that they can rank you.

Liz Stapleton [00:06:28]:
Okay. So it's not just ranking in YouTube, but ranking in Google as well.

Kelly Smith [00:06:32]:
Oh, yeah. Mhmm.

Liz Stapleton [00:06:33]:
Okay. Yeah. And I think we've all seen that when we use Google and there's, like, videos that pop. Yep. Yeah. Okay. Good to know. Okay.

Liz Stapleton [00:06:41]:
So so the title, it's it's digging into TubeBuddy. It's, you know, phrasing it in a way that creates interest, I would assume. Mhmm. Yeah. Or that answers the question that they're looking Yep. Is the same sort of thing go for tags? How do you are tags more than one word? Are they how do you like, kind of, how many tags to do and what they look like?

Kelly Smith [00:07:05]:
1st is I always tag my channel. That's that's always one of them, is, freedom in a budget is always a tag just because it links it, you know, when people are searching, I'm coming up. And then just other keywords you wanna do, whether they be, you know, you want them in the general area of, you know, how to pay off debt, debt payoff strategies, how to pay off debt fast, easy ways to pay off debt, budget burnout, like, all those different keywords that you can do that are along the same things if people are searching for it, they're gonna find your video. Okay. You can have up to 500 characters worth.

Liz Stapleton [00:07:45]:
Okay. So do you normally max out those 500 characters?

Kelly Smith [00:07:49]:
Oh, yeah. Mhmm. Yep.

Liz Stapleton [00:07:52]:
Okay. Good to know. As close as possible. Yeah. As close as possible. And this is probably super basic, but I could see people getting tripped up with it because hashtags are on, like, every other platform, but you don't do hashtags on YouTube. Correct?

Kelly Smith [00:08:07]:
Not they're they do have that thing that they started a couple months ago where you can put hashtag, and then I think up to 3 hashtags will show up right above your title on it, but I don't it doesn't really do much for SEO. It does give a little bit of credibility to people that don't understand how it works where they're almost, like, seeing as, woah, they ranked in this hashtag for it.

Liz Stapleton [00:08:31]:
Yeah.

Kelly Smith [00:08:31]:
But other than that, you don't use hashtags.

Liz Stapleton [00:08:34]:
Okay. So it's not something to really have to worry about as much when it comes to No. Okay. And then the description, you know, we are doing you mentioned you're doing social media, you're doing your exposure, affiliate links, stuff like that. Are you you know, if you're doing, like, a video that's tied to a blog post, are you pulling in part of the content of the post? You're maxing out the description. What's what's that look like?

Kelly Smith [00:08:58]:
I don't necessarily max it out, but I do like to have a paragraph or 2 of what the video is on, with the links, you know, any links that go with it. If I'm talking, you know, have an affiliate link with it, or even related videos, you know. Sometimes people wanna see other videos that are along the same topic, then they'll look in the description. And always tell people to go to the description as well. Or if you're talking about something, say the links below in the description. Go check them out. Okay. That's helpful too.

Liz Stapleton [00:09:30]:
Okay. And then I'm looking at this. My so another because this is this is, Liz Fail. When I first the very first time I, like, was trying to do YouTube, I was putting together this massive GDPR guide

Kelly Smith [00:09:43]:
back in

Liz Stapleton [00:09:44]:
2018, and I had videos for certain parts, but I didn't know you could schedule that. Yes. And so I was like, the post isn't done yet, but I need the video to be in the post, and it was like catch 22. Yep. Schedule them. You can there's a lot to I feel like there's other options there as well. So do you how much do you work in advance? How much do you schedule? How much do you just do? Sometimes it's just like, nope. Publish.

Liz Stapleton [00:10:07]:
We're good. Like, what does that look like? What do you think works best?

Kelly Smith [00:10:11]:
I always schedule. Always personally schedule. Well, I take that back, unless I'm working with a brand, that's the only time I don't schedule. I'll have it as unlisted, and then I'll give them the link to it. Okay. And some because sometimes they need approval or they need things tweaked or anything, but that's, you know, that's more just working with brands. Yeah. With scheduling, I because you wanna have a set time and day that you're you're gonna be uploading, you know, whether it be one day a week, 2 days a week, 3 days, whatever it is.

Kelly Smith [00:10:43]:
You wanna have that consistency just like a TV show. So that's why I personally don't just upload whenever or, you know, just publish whenever. I always have it scheduled even if it's, like, for tomorrow morning, or I finish editing right before, and it's, you know, even 5 minutes before, I'll I'll schedule that out. So it goes at that set time.

Liz Stapleton [00:11:04]:
Okay. Are is there like a certain time that's best to publish videos or

Kelly Smith [00:11:11]:
You really just wanna look at your own analytics and kind of test it out. Test the waters out, especially in the beginning. I in the beginning, it's it's very experimental and it's very okay. What's gonna work? What thumbnails work? What how long of videos do people like? What what topics do people like? And you can play around with the times, especially in the beginning, And there's analytics where you can see the real time view. So you can see for the last 48 hours, when are your peaks? When are people watching a lot? And then if it's 10 AM, okay, 10 AM is when I post. I personally post early in the morning, and I had people say that you're part of my morning routine, which was, like, the biggest compliment ever. Yeah. A lot of gamers, they post in the evening or, like, 5 o'clock.

Kelly Smith [00:11:57]:
Like, my husband was like, why don't you post till like 5 PM? That's when everyone posts. I was like, that's when everyone posts in your niche, what you watch, not not my niche. So it may be different, you know, for different people across the board. YouTube is not the same for everyone by any means.

Liz Stapleton [00:12:10]:
Gotcha. Okay. So looking definitely look at your analytics. And, I mean so question though, if you're just getting started, you probably don't have a lot of analytical data.

Kelly Smith [00:12:21]:
Mhmm.

Liz Stapleton [00:12:21]:
So how long does it take you to kind of I mean, if you're being consistent, right, at least once a week, maybe at different times or different days, right, because you're trying to figure it out. How long would you say before you kind of zero in? Or how many views? Or how you know, what amount of data do you need to start making those decisions, I guess?

Kelly Smith [00:12:38]:
I would say probably probably about 20 to 30 videos

Liz Stapleton [00:12:43]:
Okay.

Kelly Smith [00:12:44]:
Is what I would say, and I always recommend not to pivot the conversation, but I always recommend people to get enough videos up that are binge worthy. So if I'm going to your channel, I wanna be able to go and spend an hour at least on your channel and watch a bunch of videos. I don't wanna go to your channel and see one video and be, like, I'm not even, like, it's not even worth it to me, or you watch it and then you forget about it. But if someone comes to my channel and watches 4 videos, that's also gonna trigger the algorithm. Even if they're not subscribed to me, it's still gonna trigger the algorithm so that they pop up again and again and again.

Liz Stapleton [00:13:22]:
YouTube's creepy like that.

Kelly Smith [00:13:23]:
Yeah. Yeah. And, leaving comments. Like, I always tell people to leave every single video that you watch, leave a comment on it. Make sure it's a a meaningful comment, make sure it's not a spam, like don't say, I have a video on this too. Don't say, I have a channel too, but say, that was a great point that, you know, I learned a lot from that, or I found this to be the case, or, you know, always make sure that it's

Liz Stapleton [00:13:50]:
Starting a dialogue or a compliment.

Kelly Smith [00:13:52]:
Yeah. Always like it's always always remember that it's representing your brand. So even if it's, like, there's nothing nice to say about the video, find something to say. Like, even if it's, I think that's a cute shirt. I love your shirt. Something like that, but you never wanna put them down because what about the other people in the comments and they see it? That's gonna look bad on you.

Liz Stapleton [00:14:12]:
Your question negative Nancy.

Kelly Smith [00:14:14]:
Exactly. They're gonna see you as, like, oh, that girl's a jerk. Like, I do not wanna watch her videos. Whereas, if you say something, like, super meaningful or very helpful without trying to take away from the video and make you look like the superstar, you know, you wanna do it tactfully. Yeah. It's gonna be

Liz Stapleton [00:14:30]:
like question if it's

Kelly Smith [00:14:31]:
Right. Yeah. Yeah. And then they can be like, woah, that girl knows what she's talking about. Then when they go to your channel, you wanna have enough that they binge.

Liz Stapleton [00:14:40]:
Okay.

Kelly Smith [00:14:41]:
Have enough. So once you start getting, you know, 6 to 20 videos up, then start just going comment hog wild. Every time you watch a video, comment on it to get yourself out there and start, start getting your name out there.

Liz Stapleton [00:14:57]:
Okay. Yeah. Now I'm, like, getting ideas for videos. Okay. So we've kinda touched on the elements of a YouTube channel and the elements of post video. I feel like we started dive into just the elements of YouTube. Mhmm. There is a lot to it.

Liz Stapleton [00:15:13]:
Can can we talk a little bit more about your sort of strategies for end screens and and just yeah. Let let's start there.

Kelly Smith [00:15:22]:
This is a good one. This is one that I actually learned in the past 6 months, and it has been a game changer for my channel. Game changer. I've seen so much growth from it in the past 6 months, it's incredible. So, what I started doing is, say my video has 5 points, you know, 5 talking points or 5 tips to do this, whatever it is. At the I don't say couple of things. I don't say, in the last point is blah blah blah blah. I give I just say the next point is it's always the next point, the next point, or sometimes I'll number them like number 5 or whatever.

Kelly Smith [00:15:57]:
Never say the last point. Because once you say last point, books are closed, they're checking out,

Liz Stapleton [00:16:01]:
you

Kelly Smith [00:16:01]:
know, just like in school or whatever.

Liz Stapleton [00:16:03]:
Okay.

Kelly Smith [00:16:04]:
So then when I give the next the last point and I finish it, I sit I go into a pre planned video plug. Okay. So when I'm writing my script, I think of a video that would be helpful. Okay. So, I say let's say I'm talking about paying off debt, and my next video that I wanna plug is how to stop living paycheck to paycheck. So finish up my point blah blah blah, and I said, we're gonna keep the conversation going. I'm gonna give you tons of tips on how to set a living paycheck to paycheck, how to break that cycle. I used to do it, all the tips and everything, and I'll see you in that video.

Kelly Smith [00:16:39]:
Close, end screen. Oh. You don't say, bye. You don't say, thank you for watching. You don't you leave them like, woah, woah, woah, what the heck? I wasn't done watching, like, what do you mean, Kelly? Like, no. I don't I don't want this

Liz Stapleton [00:16:51]:
The open loop you're creating where they have to go to the next video.

Kelly Smith [00:16:54]:
Correct. So then it forces them to do it. And to get even better, you can link that specific video, but within a playlist. So if you have a playlist with it, then you can click on the playlist, click that specific video link, and put that as the end screen.

Liz Stapleton [00:17:13]:
Okay.

Kelly Smith [00:17:14]:
So that way, when they click on it, it's they're already in a playlist, they're in a loop, they're they're sucked in, they can't they can't stop.

Liz Stapleton [00:17:20]:
Yeah. You they've gone down the YouTube rabbit hole.

Kelly Smith [00:17:23]:
Yeah.

Liz Stapleton [00:17:23]:
Like, you know, for me, because I do that at night and I'm like, oh, shit. I meant to go to bed, like, a half hour ago unless I'm, like, staring at my phone.

Kelly Smith [00:17:31]:
Yeah.

Liz Stapleton [00:17:31]:
And it started, like, an hour ago, hour and a half. You know? Yep. It's that little rabbit hole. Okay. No. That's that's great. So what, because, you know, I think you said it took you about 3 years to get to 20,000, but then, like, another year you've already gotten 25%. So kind of what strategies have you seen to, like, help that grow, and what does it mean to have more subscribers? Like, obviously, there's the whole you need a 1,000 subscribers and a certain amount

Kelly Smith [00:17:58]:
of

Liz Stapleton [00:17:59]:
time to monetize. And if you want to talk about getting to that point and things that help you get there, and then if we can talk about what helped you get, you know, the next Yeah. How'd you how'd you get that first 1,000? How what did that look like? What's your

Kelly Smith [00:18:11]:
I was actually grandfathered in, so I didn't have to meet the monetization rules. If I if I wasn't already at that point, then I would have to qualify for it. But I was already at that point when they've hit those new rules.

Liz Stapleton [00:18:24]:
Okay.

Kelly Smith [00:18:24]:
But for people now starting, you need a 1000 subscribers k. And 4000 hours of watch time.

Liz Stapleton [00:18:32]:
Okay.

Kelly Smith [00:18:32]:
So, now that can be a lot. I have a lot of friends that have hit the 1,000 subscribers and then they have like half of the watch time. So it's, you know, getting that watch time up it can be tricky, and then growing. A big thing is niching down. Okay. I personally was in 2 different niches and I tried to make it work and I tried to convince myself that they intertwined and it was okay, And I was like, Kelly, nope. You got a niche down. You got a niche down.

Kelly Smith [00:19:00]:
And I was like, y'all say this, but I don't believe it and I've seen this person that's successful Stapleton does it, and this person is successful, and yes, there may be those unicorns out there

Liz Stapleton [00:19:10]:
Yeah.

Kelly Smith [00:19:11]:
That can do it and have multiple niches. But for me, personally, when I decided to finally niche down, that's when I took off, and that's when I exploded. And so I

Liz Stapleton [00:19:21]:
was like Having a clear focus with your Yeah. Gotcha.

Kelly Smith [00:19:26]:
Yep. That's huge. And if you wanna go broader as you get bigger, then you can definitely do that as well. You know?

Liz Stapleton [00:19:33]:
Out. Yeah.

Kelly Smith [00:19:34]:
Yeah. If you like, you know, Graham Stephan, he just hit 1000000 subscribers. He could probably talk about whatever the heck he wants to right now, and he would still get 200,000 views on a video, but, you know, he didn't do that at 10,000 subscribers. You know, like, he you had to get bigger, and then you can kinda branch out a little bit more into, like, the lifestyle, the vlogging, all of that.

Liz Stapleton [00:19:58]:
Okay. Yeah. And so, what did you so you I feel like you're right. Like, the subscriber bit is not as hard to hit necessarily. Mhmm. How do you get those watch time hours? Like, anything you would suggest to kind of you know, if you're if you got the subscribers and you're trying to get the watch time hours, what would you do publish more? Are your videos longer? Like, what do you do?

Kelly Smith [00:20:22]:
Really just getting into that loop of, you know, getting people to keep on watching. And also, when you do get the analytics, when you do have enough data for it, watch your audience retention. Where are the graphs? Where are people dropping off? And then go back and look at what they did to drop off at that time. And then I don't really typically do use cards anymore, but if I do have a drop off where all of a sudden it's like, and then goes down, I'll put an Icard right before that to keep them on the platform. So that way, if they're right about to drop off, then I'm gonna try and get something to trigger them to keep watching another video of mine. But audience retention, if you can really hone in on how to keep your audience, their attention what they want, then they're gonna keep on watching. And if you can study that and study what they're going off off to or, you know, off to another video, then you can really hone in. Live streams are another great one.

Kelly Smith [00:21:22]:
I just had a live stream stream last night with one of my friends who was trying to get his watch time up. So, we had 4 of us on the live stream and, you know, it's just another way. To I think he got 17 hours worth of worth of watch time, which, you know, it doesn't seem like a lot, but

Liz Stapleton [00:21:38]:
It adds up.

Kelly Smith [00:21:39]:
Yeah. It adds up. Yeah.

Liz Stapleton [00:21:40]:
Yeah. Mhmm. But I used to I mean, YouTube has changed its, like, its stuff. Because I used to run my webinars using a YouTube live Mhmm. link, and, like, you can't do that now. It's it changed. It's annoying. But I get so much, like, watch time.

Liz Stapleton [00:21:53]:
I was like, oh. I was like, that's really just for my webinar. But, but, yeah, I know. That's a great point is doing lives because I think people are, you know maybe initially, like, doing a live was intimidating, but, like, people do it on Instagram. They do it on Facebook. Like, you could just do the YouTube live too.

Kelly Smith [00:22:10]:
And if you're gonna do it, have topic ready, have questions ready, maybe, you know, pull your Instagram for questions or know know what you're gonna go in on, You know, because there may be dull silences. We can just talk where you can just be like, okay, and then next we're gonna talk about this topic and this is what I found for that. Because a lot of them they were like, alright, leave your questions in the comments and we'll be through. And then

Liz Stapleton [00:22:30]:
you're standing there like twiddling your thumbs waiting for questions. Yeah.

Kelly Smith [00:22:33]:
It's so awkward. Yeah. And you may have 5 people in your 1st live stream, but, you know, that's okay. Those 5 people, it's gonna mean so much to them. And then I'm able to get that 1 on 1 attention and that's gonna make them a super fan. You know, they were the you'll be from the beginning. You gave them that undivided attention. They're gonna love that.

Kelly Smith [00:22:49]:
So don't take it as bad if you only have a few people in your livestream. You should be like

Liz Stapleton [00:22:54]:
More than you had before. Exactly.

Kelly Smith [00:22:57]:
And be like, alright. Have the mindset of, alright. I'm gonna go and I'm gonna keep them. I'm going to make them a super fan. I'm gonna treat them with the white glove service. Yeah. And I want to make them, you know, trust me, think the world of me.

Liz Stapleton [00:23:12]:
Tell everyone about me, you know?

Kelly Smith [00:23:13]:
Yeah.

Liz Stapleton [00:23:14]:
Mhmm. Yeah. Because if you think about, like, 5 people, it doesn't seem like much. But if you do, like, a 20 minute live, that's over that's, like, an hour and 40 minutes watch time.

Kelly Smith [00:23:23]:
Mhmm.

Liz Stapleton [00:23:23]:
You know? So Yeah. That's every every every person counts. Yep. And treat them that way. Treat them like people. Treat them like your people. Yeah. So my next question, or something I'd like to talk about is sort of video content.

Liz Stapleton [00:23:40]:
Right?

Kelly Smith [00:23:40]:
Mhmm.

Liz Stapleton [00:23:40]:
Because some people, they just talk to a camera. Some people, it's like doing a present. What do you think works best? I know it's gonna vary by niche depending on what you're doing. Like, obviously, makeup tutorial or, like, a nail you know, that's, like, clearly Mhmm. But, you know, you're in the personal finance space or someone who's in, you know, other things. What sort of approach do you think how should you figure out what approach to take with the video? Because some people aren't comfortable in front camera.

Kelly Smith [00:24:05]:
Yeah. Well, first talking about getting comfortable in front of a camera. One thing that I always recommend people to do and you're gonna feel like an idiot, but is go around and vlog around your house while you're cooking dinner, while you're cooking. Be like, alright guys, I'm cooking dinner blah blah blah and this is the ingredient, like, you're gonna feel like an idiot, but it's gonna get you comfortable talking. It's gonna get you comfortable looking at the lens and not yourself. That is huge. Because if people are like, she's just looking at herself the whole time. Why am I even here? You know, she conceded.

Kelly Smith [00:24:39]:
Like, people are crazy on the Internet. They just go to the worst. Yeah. But it's just gonna get you used to talking on camera. I look back to my old videos and I said, every three words. Yep. And so just getting used to that is huge. And it all also depends on, you know, how comfortable you are with different camera angles and use of camera, like, different shots are really important.

Kelly Smith [00:25:05]:
I personally do talking head, so I just do one head on. I don't have the multi camera setup. Mhmm. I don't vlog in my typical video. Sometimes I'll use some b roll, but I keep it pretty basic. But I am trying to up my game, you know, as I'm saying this.

Liz Stapleton [00:25:23]:
So We all are. If you don't look at your first videos, you know, later on and cringe, like, you clearly you waited too long. Yeah. Yeah. For sure. Okay. So speaking so do do you wanna touch on what b roll is? Because you did mention it. I wanna make sure

Kelly Smith [00:25:38]:
you put the

Liz Stapleton [00:25:39]:
name and the term. And what it is and how you would use it?

Kelly Smith [00:25:42]:
Yeah. So b roll is just when you're watching a video and something comes across the screen or something pops up and it's like a video playing, that kinda emphasizes the topic of what you're doing. So if you're talking about, I don't know, a beach vacation or you talk about a a trip that you took and discussing it or how much cost whatever it may be. You may have a video come up on screen of the beach of you and your kids playing of whatever it may be, and just building that visual. So, it's help helping to keep them engaged in the video, because if it's just your straight head the whole time, they can get bored with that. So it was just kind of keeping them visually impaired or sometimes I'll do little pop ups of different things to kind of emphasize the point, maybe what I'm talking about and having the words on the screen so that it really hones in the point. They can read it almost like a slide type of thing.

Liz Stapleton [00:26:33]:
Okay. And then I kinda wanted to ask, what are you using to edit? How do you go about editing? How do you go about learning to edit? Right? Because sound is super important. You know? Share wisdom, please.

Kelly Smith [00:26:49]:
So when I first started Okay. I only we're gonna get into story time. I only trimmed the first, like, the beginning and end of each video on my iPhone, and when you go into edit video on iPhone, like, just hitting the edit button, there's like this little bar they can move, but if you move it too much, it goes too far, and then if it goes and we would be driving their church, like, oh, crap. I went too far. Oh, I missed a spot, and it would take me 20 minutes to get the little ticker in the exact spot.

Liz Stapleton [00:27:19]:
Yeah.

Kelly Smith [00:27:19]:
So I've definitely upgraded my editing from there. Now I personally use Final Cut Pro, which is about $300 investment. Imovie, if you have a Mac, Imovie pre installed. It's free. That's a great option. Premiere Pro is also another great option that's a little bit more of a step up as well.

Liz Stapleton [00:27:39]:
You just use YouTube to learn how to use those tools?

Kelly Smith [00:27:42]:
YouTube University. Yeah. There are so many blog posts and so many videos. There's still I only know, like, maybe 40% of all that final cut can do, if that. There's still stuff that I'm learning every day and there's still stuff that I go to Google or look up on YouTube of how do I do this? How do I change that setting? Or I'm I'm having this problem. What do I do for it? So the YouTube's your best friend for that.

Liz Stapleton [00:28:07]:
Yeah. Yeah. And there's, you know, like you say, you don't have to necessarily spend $300 on Mhmm. Editing software or even a camera to start out. You use your phone for several years. Phones have great cameras on them.

Kelly Smith [00:28:17]:
Yeah.

Liz Stapleton [00:28:17]:
You know? So Mhmm. Don't afraid to do that. What do you ever you know, because people know a lot I I know a lot of people are like, I wanna make sure I have everything before I start, but you don't need to. No. Go. But, is there, like, lighting kit or microphone? Do you use a microphone? Is that super important? Do you just use the computer microphone? Like, because sound is really important when it comes to video and no one wants to listen to a video with terrible sound.

Kelly Smith [00:28:44]:
Oh, yeah. Audio is so important. Audio is way more important than lighting. Audio is a game changer. If it's crappy audio, you can barely hear it. If there's too loud of a if there's background noise, whatever it may be, they're static, people are just gonna click off. You're, like, you're gonna get 2 seconds at them and they're gonna be like, see you. I'm out.

Kelly Smith [00:29:06]:
It's very important. I do have a resource list that I'll have for you guys with all of the stuff that I use. I have it from the beginning when I first started my channel and how I've upgraded, so there's totally different price points Yeah. In it. And you can you can have fun with the the lighting and everything, and, you know, I started doing backlighting and working on different camera angles and stuff. So it can it can get to be fun.

Liz Stapleton [00:29:32]:
Okay. I like that. Yeah. And then any I mean, I feel like we've kinda covered the basics. I feel like we've done YouTube 101, getting started on YouTube. Any additional tips or advice you have for people that are are really just getting started or all they've done is, like, set up the channel name, you know?

Kelly Smith [00:29:54]:
Now, this one it's kind of contradictory. Okay. But in the beginning, it's your videos, unless you're like have an editing background, a film background, or anything like that, most likely they will be embarrassing and that's totally fine. If you go back to Freedom and Budget, it's it's bad. It's bad. All the ones from 2016, but with that being said, say a video goes viral, make sure it's not too embarrassing. So you wanna make sure that it's still, like, you would still be proud of the video. Never just rush videos just to throw them up.

Kelly Smith [00:30:31]:
I did that. I did 5 videos a week for over 2 years. And I'll be honest, a lot of the videos sucked and people kept on telling me, Kelly, but if you up your quality then then it will be better and be like, what do you say about my quality? But, yeah, let's be honest. You know, it wasn't good. A lot of the videos were, but some of them were, but not all of them. I was just throwing whatever I could because I was trying to get watch time. I was trying to get whereas when I, like, took back some videos, I ended up getting more views because it was a content overload.

Liz Stapleton [00:31:03]:
Yeah.

Kelly Smith [00:31:03]:
So with that being said, make sure that you'd be proud of it. Like, for instance, my top video, I mess up the intro and then just keep on going. Like, I didn't even I didn't even edit it out because I wasn't editing at that time. I was just trimming either end of the video. Yeah. And it's embarrassing, and so I don't I've thought about taking it down, but at the same time I'm getting comments that this was so helpful. This really helped me, and I'm afraid

Liz Stapleton [00:31:31]:
that that would be perfect. Yeah.

Kelly Smith [00:31:33]:
Right, but at the same time, I don't want people to look at a video and think that that's what my channel is like. That's the quality of my channel and being like, okay. Yeah. That may have been helpful, but I'm done. Like, this isn't this isn't for me. So just, kind of, with that being said, make sure that you'd be proud of any video that you put out with the intention of what if it goes viral? Like, that's gonna be their first impression of you, and you can't redo that.

Liz Stapleton [00:31:57]:
Yeah. Okay. No. That I think that's a great point. And I know, you know, you've touched on it, but you do have something free for all the attendees, and the link is below what you wanna tell us about
