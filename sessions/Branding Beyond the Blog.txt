[00:00:12.090] - Adeyinka Obisanya
Hi, everyone. We are going to be talking about "Branding Beyond The Blog." I'm really super excited about this for a number of reasons, because if you're here, you've probably already gotten past the how-tos —this is not going to be a conversation about how do you make your first blog, what website should you use, what platform, those things like that. You've already mastered all of those things, and you're not new to blogging. You are ready to scale. That's typically who I'm going to be speaking to today. Because you're just so damn good at it, people are asking you, "How do you do it?"

[00:00:54.740] - Adeyinka
You're probably at a point where you're probably going to start introducing new streams in your business if you haven't already. The switch from just a blogger to now becoming a personal brand or an expert in your field is now budding. If that's the case, we need to talk because hi, my name is Adeyinka, but everyone calls me Ade. I am a brand and web designer to online female entrepreneurs. I've helped coaches launch, I've helped therapists launch, I've helped so many people launch. Something that I've seen that they all have in common on the back end as well as the front end is that they have a strong visual brand.

[00:01:40.560] - Adeyinka
Because I'm on the back end, because I see some of the marketing funnels, because I do the design for them, because I have been on the back end when it comes to them creating their courses, or creating their shops and things like that, I see the direct correlation between really good design and sales. We're going to talk about that more because that tether between the two is trust. I have designed for a myriad of people: photographers, some bloggers, some ex-bloggers, authors, the design style varies. It's very expansive. Typically, it's modern, it's clean, but things like that. But it varies based on the ideal client, which we'll also be talking about later.

[00:02:25.130] - Adeyinka
There is something very unique about the place that you're in right now. It is when your influence starts to expand. You built a blog, probably because you wanted to share a piece of yourself on the little corner of the internet, and you're like, well, if somebody starts to relate to it, I'm probably going to write something about how I got my kid to sleep through the night. I'm probably going to write about my favorite fall outfits or things like that. And people started gravitating to me because they could see themselves in you. It was very relatable.

[00:02:59.340] - Adeyinka
But again, and when you get to this point where you start scaling and you start becoming an expert, your influence expands in a different way. And people are not necessarily gravitating to you because of the relatability, because you have a Stanley Cup too. They are gravitating towards you because you are an expert. You are where they actually want to be. There's a shift that happens because you are moving from brand partnerships to mentorship. We'll talk about that more.

[00:03:30.670] - Adeyinka
When that happens, your customer base is different. When you're doing brand partnerships, typically you are just a commodity —it's almost like a Facebook ad. They are borrowing your audience so that they can sell to them. But again, it's really subtle and you start to place things in your everyday life like, "Oh my gosh, hey guys, I got this lotion from Trader Joe's. I really love it. It has glycolic acid in it." And you subtly drop that in there. "Oh, by the way, there's a link to my bio." It's completely different when people start asking you, "How did you do it?

[00:04:08.220] - Adeyinka
"Are you able to tell me a course on the step-by-step ways? Are you able to sell me a course on the step-by-step ways to do that?" One, the price point is different. Two, the way in which you're going to market to that person is completely different. I'm usually my client's secret weapon when it comes to them relaunching a service, or launching a service, or relaunching their business and product. There is something that I want you to know that I'm pretty sure those of you that are already at a place where you're negotiating branders and things like that, is that you're more than just a blogger. You are a complete marketing asset.

[00:04:53.260] - Adeyinka
Something that I have not expounded on is that I am a brand and web designer, but I also work in corporate. I'm an account executive, and some of the brands that I manage are the brands that you see in Target when you walk in, and they have some pretty hefty marketing budgets. They lean on influencer marketing to tap into an audience that otherwise they couldn't buy just a Facebook ad, that they couldn't buy a commercial. When you start understanding that it's more than a blog that you're trying to brand, and it's you as a marketing professional, that will be how you start winning.

[00:05:38.130] - Adeyinka
Remember I started talking to you about how you are really that tether between the consumer. Typically, what I'm seeing with bloggers is it's like B2B marketing. It's like this in-between where you are a business yourself, and then you are trying to negotiate with another business brand, to then determine what cost will it be for us to borrow some of your time and effort, and resources to market to your audience, the consumer.

[00:06:09.430] - Adeyinka
When you start branding yourself as an expert and you want to teach people how you do it, you want to start selling courses, you want to start selling e-books and things like that, that is a completely different ball game because now it is business to consumer. It's not as simple as linking something in your TikTok shop. It is about getting people to trust you and getting people to believe that you can get them to the same heights, or same realm or results that you got for yourself.

[00:06:42.020] - Adeyinka
The differences are vast. You now have to play the role of expert instead of peer. Again, I was talking about how you have everyday things like you just wear your lotion and you have your Stanley Cup. I'm a Owala girlie, you know.  I'm not a Stanley Cup girl, I'm a Owala girlie. Those type of things make people gravitate towards you. As you start becoming a big, heavy hitter like your Jenna Kutcher's, like your Jalisa Jefferson, Raven Elyse, when you start getting to those levels where people might invite you to speak, or brands might ask you to consult, or people might start asking you, "How did you do it? Do you have a course? Do you have a one-on-one mentorship?" They are going to you, not necessarily because they can see themselves wearing the same leggings as you, but because you have knowledge that they don't have.

[00:07:38.840] - Adeyinka
Again, now your value is knowledge versus relatability. Another key difference is that a simple Linktree, LiketoKnowIt, Amazon Storefront, Stan.Store is no longer enough, because you now have to massage this audience in a different completely way. You need a powerful website, not just the blog that's going to support all of your marketing efforts on the back end, that's going to support when they come in for a freebie, that's going to support when they want to shop, that's going to support everything that you can have full control over it.

[00:08:12.260] - Adeyinka
That is a different realm from somebody that's just trying to figure out how to do their first blog. This is a completely different realm. And those of you that are in that space where people are asking you, "How did you do it?" This is for you. I want you to know two things. Good design reassures. Again, in order for this to work, to make that transition from just a blog to now a personal brand, a lifestyle brand, an expert in your field, you have to make people feel comfortable in giving you their money. Something happens because when you link a TikTok item, or when you link something on your LikeToKnowIt, they're going to that site for the reviews. You are actually a review. You're the middleman. But now people have to give their money to you when it comes to books and courses and things like that. They need to feel good when they get on that page. It can't be a rinky-dink page, right? It can't be a rinky-dink link. They need to feel like, okay, this person actually knows what they're talking about, and that cookie-cutter blog isn't going to cut it.

[00:09:23.430] - Adeyinka
Secondly, good design accredits. I use this example, if you remember [inaudible 00:09:28] from a few years ago, they were able to sell so many tickets because they looked like they knew what they were doing. The good thing is you actually know what you're doing, and you can market that into a course or ebook or anything like that. But they would not have been able to sell out, because they sold out. They would not be able to get some of the people to fly over there if the branding was not that good. Because the branding is going to help build credibility, and that credibility is going to get trust, and that trust is what gets people to spike, and invest in you. That's what's going to lead to sales.

[00:10:03.850] - Adeyinka
I want to test this out because I love showing this in action. This is where I think a good amount of people end up being. They have a blog. This is my old client, Candace. They have a blog, but they have a website, and it's where they pretty much dump and house everything. It's cute. It's very lifestyle, has really nice pictures and things like that.

[00:10:28.480] - Adeyinka
But I want you to question, think within yourself, which expert do you trust more? Her, this Candace, or this Candace? This Candace or this Candace? You don't have to be a coach because Candace actually is a coach. You don't have to be a coach. But again, there's that shift in expertise. She didn't lose a lot of her fun. She still kept some of the corals, she still kept the pop colors and things like that. However, her expertise is now more shown and repackaged. Candace got really, really popular online. She was already popular on Instagram, and then she blew up on TikTok.

[00:11:08.430] - Adeyinka
I've personally gotten messages from people that have ended up on her page and seen my site print at the bottom. She's like, oh my gosh. Probably the reason why I ended up loving Candace and working with her is her website. I loved how everything was just laid out. Then the copy spoke to me and things like that. That is what ends up aiding and helping her become a multi-six-figure coach, on top of whatever brand deals and things like that she's working with on the side.

[00:11:35.420] - Adeyinka
Again, this is for the person that wants to scale. They've already figured out the blogging thing. They've already figured out how to work with brands. But now you want to expand your influence and start tapping into a different market. Again, we're going to test this one more time. This is Nikita, the person that I showed in the very beginning and said, "We're going to talk about later." Who do you trust more? This is what I call very "Hey girl, hey." I talk about it on TikTok quite a bit. Do you trust this version of Nikita or this version of the Nikita? She doesn't really have to look so much of a coach like Candace, right? But she's her own version of an expert. It's very clean, it's very modern, it's very slightly moody. The aesthetic is going to vary per person, and we'll talk about that later. But again, the way in which you present yourself, you feel better knowing that this person can help me figure out how to get to their realm, than this person.

[00:12:35.040] - Adeyinka
That is an important point to point out is that even with the same content, these people aren't different. The two ladies that I said that I just showed, they're not drastically different. They don't look drastically different. Nikita has her hair the same way, Candace still has her hair very blonde. Their clothes didn't change too much, and we'll talk about the clothes later as well. What I did was represent the way in which they were shown online, so that that credibility and the expertise could pop. These things work together because they're very, very important.

[00:13:15.120] - Adeyinka
Website copy. This one you made your blog is very different because you're trying to sway a person to make a big purchasing decision. Typically ebooks aren't really that expensive, they run 20, 30, 40, 50 dollars. Courses start getting up there. The way that you speak on your blog is completely different than the way in which you would speak on a website, for an expert. Photography, people just messed that up because the way in which you take lifestyle-photos can be very "Hey girl, hey," and you and your ideal client will be on the same level, but we want that expertise to show. Again, typography can have an impact as well as color story. Notice how logo is not on here because it's bigger than the logo, it's a brand aesthetic in general, and we'll talk about that.

[00:14:03.860] - Adeyinka
Your brand aesthetic is largely determined by your ideal client. I'm pretty sure everyone's heard that already. What I will bank every dollar I have on is that your brand aesthetic is only as strong as the ideal client that you and your designer perform, the research that you guys perform on the back end. You want every design that you push out to be anchored on the ideal client. You see that each of these designs are completely different, and that's because the ideal client for each of these are completely different.

[00:14:34.050] - Adeyinka
The question is, how do we get there? Again, we want to serve as a credible source because we're marketing differently. We're marketing B2C this time. Everyone keeps talking about the like and the trust process. What I want to show is that we get there by speeding up that process with the ideal client research. Now it starts here. Like I said, when you first put your blog up, it's probably all about you. You got to show up on your little corner of the internet, pick whatever colors that you wanted. It's completely different when you are trying to convince someone to make a purchase in yourself.

[00:15:12.730] - Adeyinka
We start here in what I like to call the ideal client avatar. I like to visualize this person. In this case, this was real work for a real client. We have the corporate, she comes here, and we wanted to visualize what she would look like. This is some of the research that you would want to perform. Then from there, we get to an aesthetic. You see how here in the little room, we can see, we can picture her in that room from the ideal client. You see how we can picture her hanging out with these women at lunch, and we can see her in clothing like this? That is what we want to do.

[00:15:59.330] - Adeyinka
That's the type of research that we want to do to start to land on an aesthetic. So that when you do start positioning yourself as a personal brand, when you do start positioning yourself as someone to speak, or somebody to start consulting for brands, to add on top of these brand partnerships that you're already doing, it lands and it meets the right people.

[00:16:19.570] - Adeyinka
On top of that, once we have the ideal client set and we have the mood and the colors and things set, brand photography is where a lot of people miss the mark. Your brand photos really should show a process because now you are teaching something. It's not, again, you just picking up lotion and having it be embedded in your everyday life. You are now teaching people, this is how you can do it. This is how I can teach you how to do it. They should show a process and they should further the credibility. We don't want to keep seeing images of you walking down the street. You don't necessarily have to be in a suit, but it doesn't have to be, "Hey girlfriend" type of marketing all the time. It really, most of the time, to be honest, it really should build up that credibility as an expert.

[00:17:12.680] - Adeyinka
The issue is that most people don't plan. If you see me on TikTok, I talk about this a lot. Your brand photography is such an important tool, and you waste so much money with —you waste so much money not planning it. When you figured out your ideal with your designer, it really should be brought to life with props, with clothes, with the venue, with the shot list. I'm going to show you an example of it with my clients.

[00:17:41.040] - Adeyinka
Nikita, that was the second person that we spoke about where she had the purple and things like that. I helped style that aesthetic based on the ideal client that we had. I'll send over these styles and things like that. Why? Because Nikita had a membership, again, that's B2C, she had people that she now wants to sell a membership too. She now is trying to pitch to universities to start allowing her to teach about wellness and things like that. That is completely different than just a brand partnership. It's not to minimize a brand partnership, but again, we are starting to open up new revenue streams that require us to look different. It came out like this. You see some of the resemblance. You see the colors I told her to stay with. You see the textures that I told her to stay with. This is by design so that we can get to the site that we want. Like I said, good design reassures. This person, they might feel a lot more comfortable swiping their card with. They're like, oh my gosh. Yeah, I think that she would be a really good person to help me with my wellness.

[00:18:51.580] - Adeyinka
Same thing with Naboo (??). This was Naboo. This is a good point where I say it all doesn't have to be in a suit. We don't have to be in a suit. It really just depends on who you are and who your ideal client is, and finding that helpful mesh between the two. I styled this shoot as well. I usually style this shoot find locations, find a photographer, all those types of things, and they came out well. This one I actually was on set for. I flew to Chicago with her. These are the type of things that as she starts putting these pictures in her pitch deck, as she starts trying to teach other photographers how to get to where she is, they start trusting that. They start trusting her because, again, the way that she's presented starts creating a lot of that trust. Why? Because it's cohesive and it's built on all this research.

[00:19:42.420] - Adeyinka
Now that we have the ideal client, the research behind that, now that we have went and got the photos, we now can start building out the layout. Typically at this point, you have the copy. People start asking me, "What platform should we use?"

[00:19:58.170] - Adeyinka
It really honestly just depends on what works for you. I personally use Showit. If it's going to be service-based, it's going to be Showit for me. If it's going to be e-commerce, which doesn't apply to me really, it's going to be Shopify. I like Showit because there's a lot of the drag-and-drop capabilities that people really like with Wix. However, it's a lot more robust because it's backed by WordPress. Again, when I said that the way in which you present yourself matters because now your site has to be a lot more robust, it has to hit a lot more pain points for this person. If you ever see a website like Jenna Kutcher, who's a big, big, big blogger, you will start to see that she has sales pages. You will start to see that her website is not just about the blog pages and linking it. It's really serving a purpose to start funneling people into her marketing funnel. These are some of the sections you would see on a sales page, again, to get people to move off of just the site and into the places that you own, like your e-mail list and so on and so forth.

[00:21:09.730] - Adeyinka
This, you can see a breakdown of her site where we have the Header, and we can talk about quickly what's working. We have the strong images, like we said, that start supporting her sales messaging. It's a different nuance of sales. Again, when you're online working with brands, it's a lot more subtle. They want it to be organically placed in your day, but it has to be kinda subtle, not really, but not so. Again, it's a lot more pushy when you start becoming an expert because you want to tell people, "You need this. I promise you, you want this."

[00:21:48.110] - Adeyinka
Again, based on who the ideal client is, Nikita's membership is really all about finding joy after grief and things like that. We use the pictures to start showcasing that. We start using photography, and the copy, and the colors to start playing on the emotions of the people that really want to work with her, to reassure them that this is the right place. We use a lot of white text and clear call-to-actions. Again, things that are different in the world of blogging where you might just be linking things. It's really not about the style. It's just about like, "Hey, this is what I found. This is the links that you could visit later on." It's completely different.

[00:22:38.660] - Adeyinka
Again, with what's working, we want this dance between credibility, relatability, and then having people understand that they can trust you to buy. Again, this all has to do with the design, you would work with designer to make this work. They would start implementing design tactics so that they start breaking the text in the middle, all these types of things that it makes it seamless so that when someone gets on your website, they're not lost and they're not confused, and they want to continue down the page on the sales page and get off the website and into your funnel.

[00:23:16.230] - Adeyinka
We want to show the value. Again, now you have something to offer. Nikita is a good example because again, she has the membership. It's not just the blog. These are things that we use to further the credibility and let people know like, "Oh, this is what you get when you start investing in me, and investing in yourself. Then you can start to get to a place to where I am." This is really important.

[00:23:44.340] - Adeyinka
The personal brand is really important for someone that is moving forward from just the blog, and wants to start speaking, and wants to start pitching to universities, creating their own opportunities, because when they start looking up who you are, it's more than just the numbers. It has a lot to do with expertise and what expertise is shown. There's a lot of people that do have expertise, and that's why I highlighted before, it's not like people have to completely change who they were. There are people that have great expertise. It's not shown. When it's not shown, I work in marketing myself, and it's not easily seen, it's on to the next person.

[00:24:33.880] - Adeyinka
All these things work together, the design, the photos, the color theory, the typography, all those type of things work together to help you scale your business in a way that starts generating revenue.

[00:24:47.570] - Adeyinka
Really, the first question is, "How do you get started?" I have a very quick resource of condensing the rebrand. It's called the Rebrand Mastery. I'm condensing it so that we can focus on the ideal client, get you to a place where you can brand your course or brand your e-book, brand yourself, not necessarily limiting yourself to just a blogger or a TikTok influencer, or things like that. You can brand yourself to be more of a lifestyle brand, to be on speaker panels and all those type of things. This will help you get started with that.

[00:25:26.730] - Adeyinka
Again, all of these sites that I've shown is this in real action, where you can see that this person is more than just their website, but the focus is on them. You start to feel like, "Oh yeah, this person, she's important in something." Then you'll realize what the something is when you start reading the site and things like that. I highly suggest you to get the Rebrand Mastery Guide, especially if you are thinking about adding a new service or adding any service, adding a course, things like that. It will help you get started and understand like, "Okay, how do I make that shift from just blogger?" I really don't like to say just, "but how do I make that shift from blogger to also X, Y, and Z?"

[00:26:13.700] - Adeyinka
I really do thank you guys. I hope you had a really great time thinking about what more is out there for you, branding beyond the blog. Let me know if you have...
