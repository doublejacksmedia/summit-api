Hi, welcome to "Taking Action in the Right Direction." I'm Michelle Pontvert and I'm super excited to be talking about this today because I really, really, truly believe that taking action has made the biggest difference in my business, but is also kind of the secret weapon behind actually building a business you enjoy because you focus on momentum rather than that big, lofty end goal that you may have in mind, and that's totally fine. But I'm here to really encourage you to take some big, bold, brave action today. So as I mentioned, hi, I'm Michelle Pontvert or Pont-Vert if that French pronunciation is a little tricky. I really do think that my biggest superpower in business and kind of in life is that I'm just really good at doing stuff, like getting things done. Not to say I'm very talented at a lot of the things I try, but I love me a good checklist. I have never met a deadline that I did not actually never think about because I do things before the deadlines come up, but they don't stand a chance of getting missed in my books. And my hyperfocused skills, thanks to my neuro-spiciness, are something truly to be marveled at when they do engage.

[00:01:31.740] - Michelle
I've learned over a lifetime of doing stuff that, not surprising to maybe you but to me, that doing things is how things get done, that basically moving is how we move forward. I'm not here to advocate that you overwork, that you buckle down, that you do the hard things, that you just work for the sake of working. But what I am going to be talking about and what I'm super excited to share is that leaning into doing things you like in the way that you like them can really make the difference in actually getting you where you want to go. So basically, I want to help you lean into that excitement and that internal momentum that you have naturally as a human to make things happen in a way that is a lot easier for you, and that gets you where you want to go. So, I always like to preview what I'm going to be talking about. Here's a high-level of what we're going to be covering. First, I'm going to be talking about why mindset and strategy, which is very popular in this online business world, can sometimes get in the way of doing the doing. Then I'm going to be basically raving about how action-taking truly is the key to moving you forward. Then we're going to dive into gut checking to make sure that you're going in the right direction. Then I'm going to leave you with four questions to get your action-taking going in the right direction.

[00:03:03.340] - Michelle
Okay, let's get started. So, why the mindset and strategy stuff can sometimes get in the way. Particularly in this online business world, but honestly, in most places where we're trying to build something on our own, a lot of weight and a lot of energy, time, money gets invested in helping you master your mindset, like get yourself in the right space mentally and then figuring out, scoring the right strategy, figuring out the how to do things the right way. And both of those are super important parts of building a business ultimately, but I'm going to take Devil's advocate here today and argue that they aren't actually the big piece that you should be focusing on most of the time to get to your version of success. Basically, I think they're a bit over-inflated, and I'm here to share why I think they get over-inflated.

[00:04:01.050] - Michelle
Here's what I see and I'm 100% guilty of this too, so don't worry. Here's what I see happening as most people try and build their business or grow as they've actually got a business started. You have an idea. It's an idea you're super excited about and you love it, you want to get started like yesterday. These can be all sorts of ideas. I'm talking about things as small as a piece of content you want to create and something as big as a whole new offer, even the direction of your business. But there is a spark. Something has lit you up. And then what happens, usually, is we start to have some wobbles. We start to feel some feelings about this idea and start to maybe question ourselves, wondering if our audience, the people we have looking at what we're doing, maybe won't like it. Maybe you don't even have enough people in your audience anyway to pull this thing off. Maybe if it doesn't work you could have wasted your time, which is something you're very conscious of as a solo-business owner and, definitely, if you've got all the big-life stuff going on like I do and a lot of people in my world do.

[00:05:11.460] - Michelle
Maybe some inferiority complex comes in and we start to worry that we're not qualified to do the thing in the first place and that maybe even someone might judge you for doing it. You get the idea. Basically, we get stuck in this analysis paralysis space where we're just worried and anxiously questioning the idea. And all of that great momentum you'd built up with the spark, the idea, stops. It just grinds to a halt as we start to dive into those big, big questions, start to question our mindset, question our strategies. And some of those things are super valid. I don't want to bash mindset work. I don't want to bash strategy. Those are really important and valid. And some of these questions are important and valid. I personally struggle a lot with rejection-sensitive dysphoria and I know a lot of this even if it isn't the scale that maybe we feel it at, is still coming from somewhere real.

[00:06:13.750] - Michelle
But what happens, regardless of how real or not those questions are, is that we put a pause on the idea to start working on some of this bigger stuff, to examine those strategies, work on the mindset, and sometimes often start to outsource the decision-making of whether to do this idea and how to do this idea to other people. And this is where we often see people getting stuck in using other people's frameworks, going through a lot of working on ourselves, working on 'the big picture', and it pulls you out of actually doing the doing. Often this comes from, again, really understandable places. This comes from those bigger-picture questions sometimes seeming safer or smarter, or just easier in a weird way than actually doing the hard thing and doing the doing. Because what you're creating, what your idea is, is unknown. And sometimes we can't know it. How it's going to turn out is something unknowable until we've tried it, and that's really scary especially if you have other life stuff going on. If you've lived a life that causes you to question things, or if you've been born with a brain that tells you to question things. The result of all of this questioning is that you can start talking yourself out of the idea and fall out of love with it. You'll start to see the cracks, see the potential pitfalls, see the work you maybe need to do on yourself, the things you need to learn, the things you need to do before you can actually do the doing of this very first spark of an idea.

[00:08:00.780] - Michelle
Ultimately, what truly ends up happening is nothing. Sure, you may be working on some big, big stuff, really working on figuring yourself out, figuring out your big picture. But let's get to brass tacks. Nothing's happening to move that idea forward. You won't have created anything new. People won't know about it, so you won't know if they're going to like it. We don't ultimately know if it's going to work. We've just been thinking. After all of this, I feel like most of the time and myself very much included, you start to feel even more stuck now because you've added these extra hurdles in your way of doing the doing and moving forward. Basically, by trying to outthink ourselves we actually get in a way of doing things to show ourselves what's possible, and what could happen.

[00:08:56.690] - Michelle
I don't love sitting in the negative, so let's flip the switch and I'm going to talk about what can happen when we start leaning into just taking action. Honestly, the point of all of this is that we can't get anywhere without trying, without doing something, if you sit still. A body in motion will keep moving. If you sit still it's very unlikely that things are going to move forward for you, particularly move forward in a way that you want them to. That's why I'm here to advocate for, cheerlead, that first gut reaction, that step-one I mentioned, the spark, the excitement, the motivation, the momentum that sometimes comes with the new and the shiny. I'm a big fan of chasing the shiny. In my joint business with my business bestie, created entirely on the whim, we have a membership called the "Shiny Squirrel Chasers." I'm not going to hide. I love me some shiny. But it's because ultimately behind that shiny, behind that excitement is movement. It is momentum and it is something that helps you take action. And taking action is truly the only way to make things happen in your business. They're not going to happen for you. Now I know that doesn't come as easily for some of us as it does for others, and it's super understandable. As I said we've all lived life. We've got experiences of traumas and neural pathways that have taught us to mask, to shrink, to hide, to play it safe, because we needed to stay safe as people. But as business owners, we do need to step out of being the squishy humans that we are sometimes and start putting our CEO hats on, and start deciding what we want to do with this business that we control, that we get to decide, and how do you want to change that?

[00:10:53.440] - Michelle
So, here's my question to you. What do you want to do? Like with your days, with your time, with your life, with your business, that is ultimately maybe not fully in your control, but something that you get to decide. And you get to decide what feels controllable. Yes, sometimes we can't control the weather, we can't control taxes, we can't control a lot of things in life. But in our business there are things we do control, and I think we give up that control fairly easily in the face of fear. What feels doable? What is something you can manage? You have the skills, tools, equipment, space, capacity to do. What feels exciting? What feels motivating? Basically, I'm trying to provoke you to think about the things that maybe are standing in your way just because they kept you safe, but aren't actually helping you get where you want to be going and live the life that maybe does feel safer, does feel happier, does feel richer. So, I want to encourage you to ask yourself how you could lean more into the things that you do want to be doing, that you do want to feel excited about, get that momentum going, because ultimately it is up to you to make this business work, and it's up to you how you want this business to feel.

[00:12:21.380] - Michelle
This is my thesis of my business journey, of my whole deal, is that I am pretty sure if you spend more time doing things you like, that you're excited about, playing with ideas, feeling excitement, and generally enjoying the time you put into your work, the day-to-day, the hour-to-hour, the minute-to-minute, it's all going to feel a lot better. And not just that's a good thing, we want you to feel better, but that good feeling, that excitement, that enthusiasm, that momentum shows. People can see it. They can see when you're excited. They can see when you're energized. They can see when this isn't just a mundane thing you had to do, but that's something you really wanted to do. You put some of you in it, you put your heart in it, and that attracts the right people. That gets them excited about what you're doing. Ultimately, they want to pay you to get a part of that excitement because it does feel good and they can see it. At the core of it all, if you're listening to this, you are creating something that other people need to be excited about.

[00:13:30.740] - Michelle
And it's really hard to convince them to be excited if you're not. Ultimately, it comes down to that. Let's not lose focus on what it is we're sharing here, and that is energy, enthusiasm, excitement, motivation, momentum, passion! That's what's so compelling and something I think we lose track of. Here's something that while coming off my soapbox of like, "You should do more exciting, shiny things," I want to give you a realistic reality of how this actually looks. And sometimes you do start doing something that you're excited about. You do go all in. You do put aside the overanalysis, the getting your mindset and strategies and all that stuff right, and you just start doing. And I think it's only fair that we address what to do when it starts to not feel so good anymore, when something doesn't feel quite right after you have started doing the doing. And sometimes it's because we're just overworked or stimulated or just tired. That's super fair. Life is hard. And I do have some tips to help you moving again if it's literally just a motivation problem. But in the meantime, I think those feelings of stuckness can be really, really helpful because they can tell you why you're not moving in the right direction, or they can flag to you that you aren't moving in the right direction.

[00:15:08.940] - Michelle
Some of the things that it could be flagging to this feeling of things not being quite right are that maybe you've built something that people like, that gets a good reaction, but you're not actually that keen on doing or delivering. This looks a lot like you've built an offer that sells well that you hate doing, or you've built some content that people really like but you don't want to keep talking about. It's that mismatch between the external positive feedback and your own internal feeling of how you actually want to keep doing this. Sometimes the idea, the spark has morphed into something that doesn't fit you as a human anymore. So sometimes this is, you had this idea for a big marketing idea, a big venture you're going to put on an event, you're going to create a podcast or something. And slowly in the process of doing it, it's morphed into something that doesn't actually make sense for you as a human. You've built a schedule that doesn't work for your life. You've created a framework that you don't actually fit that well. You're asking yourself to do work that doesn't fit you. Let's say you hate going live and you've suddenly created an entire system where you have to go live every day. It happens. It happens to the best of us. And sometimes it's just that you don't have the capacity to continue doing this thing. Maybe it's not the right time. Maybe it's not the right fit for you as a human. I have a limited capacity in terms of time and also just energy capacity. Sometimes as much as you love something, as much as I can fall in love with an idea, as I start doing it I realize it just demands more than I have to give, and that happens. And it's okay. It's actually a really good sign that you're feeling that feeling, because when things start to get a little prickly, get a little uncomfortable, that's your best asset as a business owner. That's, again, putting that CEO hat back on.

[00:17:09.540] - Michelle
That's the thing you need to pay attention to. We need to pay attention to the spark, and we need to pay attention to the prickle. And when things start prickling, that's where the gut checks come in. Because gut checking with yourself is how you realign, how you make sure you're doing things in the right direction. You're moving where you want to be going. So here is how I use gut checking. I encourage you to explore how it looks for you. But gut checking is basically checking in with yourself to see if this idea still truly lights you up. Are you still excited about it? Do you want to keep doing it, or not? And that's okay too. We need to be really honest with ourselves when doing this gut check. Then be really critical of like, hey, did something go off the rails? We just need to adjust it to get back on course, get back to something we like doing. Or is it maybe just not the right fit and it's time to let it go? Because you can't do everything and we shouldn't be trying to do everything, and letting things go can sometimes be the most strategic, the most powerful decision you can make. And it's your job as that CEO of your business to decide what things are worth doing, again, chasing that shiny or not, and which things you want to let go. And that, if you can do it, is what helps you keep yourself on track, keeps you doing the things that light you up and, building the momentum in your business because you carve out space intentionally to do things you enjoy doing and not keep things that you don't like or can't keep up.

[00:18:51.590] - Michelle
So, all of this to say, I'm going to leave you with these questions because this is super personal to you, your business, your life. But I think it's really important to pose these questions to yourself. So, what do you love doing in your business? What tasks? What type of work? How do you like to work? What does a good day look like in your business work? Or what isn't a good day? Really start to take stock. Take stock of what feels good in your body, in your brain, in your mood. What helps you feel like you're doing work you enjoy? So what do you love doing in your business? Then the second question is, what gets in the way of you doing more of that? Is it, again, like I mentioned, the mindset stuff, the strategy stuff, using other people's frameworks? Is that a lot of 'should do' this and 'I meant to do' that kind of thinking? Is it time and capacity and you need to start examining and gut checking some of the other things you're doing so that you can clear some space for the things you love? And then how can you do more of it?

[00:20:07.290] - Michelle
As I said, it's really up to you to decide what you let in or push out of your CEO space as a business owner. You get to decide how you want this to go. So, how can you make more space for the things you love? How can you orchestrate it so that you get to spend more of your precious time and energy doing things that light you up rather than suck your energy? And then other things you're already doing in your business, what in your day-to-day, your hour-to-hour, your minute-to-minute work are you doing that might need a gut check? What are the things that are starting to feel that prickle, that discomfort that's worth paying attention to? When we start something new, there's always going to be a period of things feeling a bit sticky, a bit tricky, and that's fine and worth paying attention to, but often worth persevering if the thing we're really excited about is really worth pursuing. The excitement is still there, so it's worth moving through that. But if it's just feeling sticky, it's time for it to be evaluated and potentially go.

[00:21:15.200] - Michelle
Ultimately, I think with these four questions in mind, this is how you build a business that you not only love and enjoy but ultimately again, has that spark that other people are drawn to, that brings you the audience, that brings you the people and the money that help you keep going, that help you grow, that help you build the momentum to keep doing more of the things you love.

[00:21:39.910] - Michelle
Okay, so I did mention earlier on that you have sometimes just a motivation issue when you're doing that gut check and things are starting to feel a bit prickly. Sometimes it's just because motivation is eluding you. So I put together a free resource that has my five best tips for getting yourself moving when you can't just bully yourself into doing it. So, it is called "My Unsticking Tricks," and it is my out-of-the-box ideas to help you get moving and avoid bullying yourself straight to burnout because trust me, I've done that too, and it does not work. I would love to encourage you to sign up for that. Get those things to keep you moving on the things you ultimately do love and maybe just need a little nudge to get going. You could find that at my website, michellepontvert.com/unstuck. Thank you so much for sticking around. I really hope I've motivated you to enjoy your tasks more, to lean into some fun, some enjoyment, some spark, and give those prickly feelings the space and time they need because they are trying to tell you something, and I want you to be in the driver's seat of your own business.

[00:22:55.630] - Michelle
Thank you so much, and if this resonated with you I'd absolutely love to connect further. I'm the only Michelle Pontvert out there, so I'm pretty easy to find. I'm on Facebook, Instagram, and always on my website. I absolutely love connecting with anybody who resonates with the Pollyanna- enthusiasm I have about doing business your way, and building a business that you truly love and that fits your real life.
