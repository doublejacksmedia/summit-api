Could you last 24 hours without any access to sound? No sound on your phone? Not being able to have a simple conversation with your neighbor outside. Complete silence.

[00:00:31.530] - Speaker 1
Could you do it for 48 hours? 72 hours? How many of you are starting to get uncomfortable? You know, we live in a world that's incredibly noisy and you have no access to sound. This is normal for 350,000,000 people in the world if they have a disabling hearing loss.

[00:00:58.030] 
Did you know that people with disability are the largest minority group in the United States over any other minority group? This group crosses boundaries such as age, ethnicity, gender, race, sexual orientation and socioeconomic status.

[00:01:19.910] - Speaker 1
Small businesses, big business, every company in between. Even you as a Blogger, you are a business. We have to start prioritizing flexibility from day one. If it's too late to start from day one, start right now.

[00:01:36.140] - Speaker 1
I'm going to talk about three different ways of why it's important to be accessible for people with disabilities. First of all, it's really important that we all unlearn the assumptions that disabled people to be responsible for their own acceptability needs and start accepting responsibility. We'll also going over some actionable items that you can do right now. And finally, we're going to tell you why accessibility is better for everyone, not just for people with disability.

[00:02:14.730] - Speaker 1
I'm a DeafBlind woman who has had to face obsiticals in my entire life. With the lack of adaptability everywhere I go, including my job of eleven years. I even had a boss that told me she almost didn't hire me. During my time there, I often will be questioned whether or not I really need an interpreter during meeting or why I couldn't just answer the phone. I was also constantly told that I wasn't good enough to be a manager.

[00:02:43.180] - Speaker 1
Despite all of this, I still wanted the opportunity to move up within the company. I just didn't know how or didn't I really have the support.

[00:02:55.390] - Speaker 1
During my time at the company, the American Disabilities Act always weighed on my mind. This is something that's supposed to protect me and everybody else that has a disability. It's literally all people rights. I'd like to share that this act is only 31 years old and is younger than me. The unfortunate thing is despite having the American Disabilities Act, so many companies fail miserably in creating access for people with disabilities.

[00:03:28.990] 
Many businesses of all sizes tend to have chips, responsibility, spectates and slapped onto people with disability and assume that they should know everything about what is provided to them and what laws are. Which result in frustration and doubt. The reality is companies needs to accept responsibility on providing support. When we ask for support. Do not question what we need. I don't like being questioned about my ability even though I can speak and I can hear with the help of tool.

[00:04:05.300] - Speaker 1
This line of questioning often leads me to doubt my own ability within my disability. I know my own limits. People with disability do not need someone else questioning our own abilities. Well, we don't expect you to know everything there is, but we also don't know everything there is, especially when it comes to your business. We need this to be a collaboration rather than it being me versus you.

[00:04:34.810] - Speaker 1
How do I like, put this in perspective? Say, you've created a video for your blog, and someone reaches out to you and they've asked you, "Can you caption the video? I don't know what you're saying?" When someone tells me, "Oh, I don't have time for that." This means this comes back to us. The story we created our own head is, you don't care about me as a reader.

[00:05:04.520] - Speaker 1
So instead of doing that, you can say, "You know what? Let me look into it and let me figure it out." Or if you really don't know how to caption a video, you'll be like, "Okay, so here's my scenario. I don't know how to capture video, but I also don't want to put all the responsibility on you. How can we work together to ensure that you get what you need, because I do want to keep you as a reader?

[00:05:36.070] 
And to me, that's how you truly collaborate with somebody. Because in the past, there's been a blogger where they shifted onto podcast, and we would ask them to transcribe. And their answer to me was it cost too much money. That to me made me feel like, "Oh, I'm not valued," and that didn't feel good.

[00:06:07.360] - Speaker 1
So think about, when you answer somebody, as they reach out to you to ask you to do something, how you might make them feel as a reader.

[00:06:22.860] 
It good to remember that there is no one size system. You might have created something that's supposed to be accessible to most, but unfortunately, sometimes there might be one person that is just not accessible for. So don't be standoffish and be like, "Oh, I've already created something," and it doesn't work for that question. Maybe that's just something you need to have a conversation about.

[00:06:51.450] - Speaker 1
Truth be told, I stayed at my company way longer than I should have because I had this internal fear that I'd never get hired anywhere else because of my disability. After eleven years of dedication, I was laid off. Once I got over the shock of being laid off, I knew I had two choices: apply to work at another company and repeat the same process all over again, starting my own business. Guess which one I chose? I mean, it's obvious! I'm here now. The harder one. I started my own business, so I started my business.

[00:07:30.030] - Speaker 1
We all know it's not that easy. And the first obstical I came across was this course that I purchased online. None of the videos will captioned. I wasn't even make any money at this point. I was bootstrapping it, and I invested a good portion of my investment into this course.

[00:07:49.920] - Speaker 1
So I struggled through the course and I vowed I would never buy another course again unless I knew all the videos were captioned. So this is my perspective. Big company such as the company I worked at didn't even do a great job of it. Of giving me access so why would I ever expect a small business to provide me with access.

[00:08:18.970] 
You know, I knew the American Disability Act existed for such reasons, however, the American Disability Act did not typically apply to small businesses. Here's how it stated, if providing and creating access create undue hardship for the business, such that it is difficult to provide for or is true cost to then the business is not required to adapt. So this began my journey to educate small business owners like all of you about accessability. But when I first started, I really didn't know what I needed from these small businesses that I needed you to do in order to ensure I equal access.

[00:09:05.410] - Speaker 1
But I also knew that your budget was significantly smaller.

[00:09:10.350] - Speaker 1
So I was like, how am I going to figure this out? But my thing was I wanted everybody to know that there are 20 million people with disabilities. These people represent $490 billion in disposable income. Globally, these figures jump up to 1 billion people with disabilities with $8 trillion in disposable income. Take a moment to soak those numbers in.

[00:09:51.190] 
Understanding that people with disability have the third largest economic power over, in the world, they pushed us about Japan, Germany, United Kingdom. This means we have a lot of spending power and we have money to spend.

[00:10:11.090] - Speaker 1
So the thing is, here's how we need to think about this. We have small businesses, big corporations. The company that prioritize accessablity will put themselves steps ahead of other companies that do not prioritize accessablity. When these company do this, they're going to attract people with disabilities as consumers and their peers around them. It's also lead to more innovation because if you prioritize it from the beginning, you have been a little bit more innovative.

[00:10:52.830] - Speaker 1
You're more steps ahead and then in the result, because accessablity was built in from the beginning, you have less maintenance to deal with. You're not having to go all the way back to fix anything.

[00:11:05.100] - Speaker 1
Ola Ojewumi, Founder and Director of Project Ascend said, "Being disabled is the one group that you don't have to be born into. You can become disabled at any time. So my fight for equality and disability justice should be your fight because you may very well become a person with disability one day."

[00:11:35.050] - Speaker 1
The idea is we need to come to understanding that accessablity benifits more people than it does not.

[00:11:45.830] - Speaker 1
The reality is the world was designed and is still designed for heteronormative white male. Did you realize that people with disabilities are likely to be the original hackers? We have to hack our very daily lives as very little is designed for us. I want to share this example with you.

[00:12:13.050] - Speaker 1
The deaf community. This is the community that I've been part of my entire life. Within our community we've been communicating via texting since the early 2000s, before anybody else was. Now it's completely normal to be testing with one another. There might be some people who still pick up the phone, but you know.

[00:12:42.430] 
I also want to share the story with you. I've been part of the blogging world since the very early 2000s. This is a world to me that had no barrier. Everything was written, everything was easy. I didn't have to try so hard to understand people as if I met them in person. I stuck with blogging, even as platforms shifted.

[00:13:05.150] 
Facebook, YouTube, Instagram, Twitter, SnapChat, Tiptok, Podcast, Clubhouse. All these things started to come through and different things you can do with them. But the thing is, the last couple of years have started leaving me with the feeling of being left behind, again.You know, we have the newest and greatest thing. Accessibility priorities are being shuffled down to the bottom of the list, once again. Audio focus platform become all the rage again. I mean, there was radio, talk radio back in the day.

[00:13:48.650] 
So I'm going to go over with you how you can be acceptable on social media because I think this is one of the step in terms that will allow you to be more accessablity across your entire platform. Social media flexibility is one of the easiest things you can do and it can file into everything now.

[00:14:14.490] - Speaker 1
Number one, this is my number one rule: Caption all audio and video based content. Video content can be incredibly engaging, but without transription captions, it's not acceptable. It's that simple. All material needs to be captioned, whether it's video or audio based.

[00:14:38.430] - Speaker 1
Even if the person is signing. Me when I signed, I would make sure I have captured.

[00:14:47.290] - Speaker 1
Now, I also want you to choose your platform thoughtfully. Not all social media platform include accessibility features. For example, if you use platforms that are audio or video based, make sure you caption all your content. One of the examples, that I like to use is Clubhouse. It is audio based. However, they don't necessarily allow for transcribing in real time.

[00:15:14.530] 
Now, we're also going to talk about podcast. I know a lot of people have decided to do blogging/podcast. They all layer. I get it. Podcast is a great marketing tool and it's a converstaion piece.But be sure to provide a transcript or a caption video version of the audio content.

[00:15:40.370] - Speaker 1
Next, add an alt text for image description. So alt text is great for website and image description is great for social media. The reason why I say this outline in this way is because social media are starting to provide a space for alt text but sometimes it is easier to do image description as you can include that in your caption or first comment and schedule ahead of time. Alt text is not part of any scheduling.

[00:16:17.810] 
So alt text often is read only by the screen reader.It is invisible to any other person and you tend to add it to images on the website and social media pages. It describes the photo. There is a character limit and it is brief. Image description can be read by anyone. You can add it to your social media caption, your comment, or add the caption to a photo on the web page.It describes the photo, but it is usually a lot longer than alt text. There is no character limit.

[00:16:57.710] - Speaker 1
So if you want to know how to go add alt text on Instagram, what I suggest is you cannot do this on your computer. You have to do it on your phone. So when you go into the app, you'll go to your most recent photo and then you click on that photo and you're going to click on three dots in the upper right hand corner above the image that you want to edit. And then a window will pop up and it will give you a list of options. You want to select edit. And then the next thing that comes up is your picture with your caption and everything. You don't have to go all the way up to your picture. And in very faint white text, depending on how light or dark your images you'll see in the lower right hand corner of the image, you'll see text that says Edit alt test. You will want to click on that. Then a new window opens up that says, that is alt text and you can type in your alt text. And click done, that's it.

[00:18:05.590] - Speaker 1
So how do you write alt text? Number one, you'll want to keep it under 125 characters. This is shorter than a tweet. It's really important for you to describe the important aspect of your image. If it's purely decorative image, it doesn't need alt text.If it's a photo of a pie chart, say it's a pie chart. No keyword stuff. You're also not going to write the word "photo of". We already know it's a photo.

[00:18:38.870] 
Next, you're also going to write image description. Basically, the idea is object, action, content. Object is the main focus of your image. Action describe what is happening, what the object is doing, and context described the surrounding environment.

[00:19:04.290] - Speaker 1
To also define it more objective, concise, descriptive. So people using the description can form their own opinion. You also want to keep it concise enough to allow them to absorb all the concepts. But yet you still want it to be descriptive enough to explain all the essential aspects of the image.

[00:19:29.410] - Speaker 1
Finally, there are so many details to keep in mind. You do want to describe race and gender if it's relevant to the image. If you know what their identity is and how you describe it is consistent with other. If you are unsure, then describe them as people or person.

[00:19:52.150] 
Each of these are super simple actions you can take do to take that next step of being accessible for everything.

[00:20:05.810] - Speaker 1
As Nikki Eslami, founder of Wild Elements said, "Building a culture of transparency where people understand that while we can always improve and involve, we are rooted in being kind to one another."

[00:20:26.310] - Speaker 1
But I want to encourage you to get out of your own way and stop creating based on the assumption that only one way to do things. There are so many things out there that marketed as the only way. And this is the best way to do things. We all know you are bloggers. It is so far from the truth.

[00:20:45.870] - Speaker 1
There is not one way to blog. There's all kinds of ways! So with accessablity get out of your own way. We also want to shift our focus of accessablity to be more of the inclusive design. It considers the full range of human diversity with respect to ability, language, culture, gender, age, and other forms of human defense. We can and we should do better.

[00:21:21.780] 
Here's something that we can improve going forward and that is that working with people with disability, the collaborative effort. Do not put all the responsibility on them. So if you see someone like a fellow blogger, they've like done a video on social media that's not captioned. Give them a nudge and be like, "Hey, make sure you caption yourvideo.' And then finally stop shuffling acceptable priority down to the bottom of your to do list. Start prioritizing it.

[00:21:58.520] - Speaker 1
Take a look at where you need to improve accessibility within your own company. Start with your own people. Start with your own consumers. Understand and know that being acceptable benefits more people than it does not. Start to shift your focus to include the full range of human diversity.

[00:22:24.290] - Speaker 1
To be honest, we're not expecting things to be absolutely perfect, but people with disabilities, such as myself, we do want to have the same access as you, an able bodied person. And the way we can get there is with a little help from you for making in this shift to be a more accessible world for both you and me. Thank you.
