[00:00:09.430] - Liz Stapleton, Summit Host
All right, guys, today I'm really excited to have Kim Doyle with us talking about content creation. I love her planner. Kim, thank you so much for being here. Can you tell us a little bit about yourself in case someone hasn't heard of you before?

[00:00:23.080] - Kim Doyle, kimdoyal.com
Yes. Well, first of all, thank you for having me. So, I am formally known as a WordPress chick. I was WordPress for about ten years, pivoted to my personal brand a few years ago and really fell in love. I've sort of- not accidental entrepreneur, but had no intention of getting into WordPress and building websites. And I was just kind of on a mission to find something I could do from home. And so fast forward almost 13 years and I have my personal brand Kim Doyle.com. And we've got the content creators planner that was an idea that wouldn't let go of me a couple of years ago. And I reached out to my business partner, who is a graphic designer and brilliant and talented with so many things. I'm like, "You want to do this with me?" It's like, "I'm in, let's do it." And we went from idea to fruition in like four months. So, you know, it's been a fun ride. I've done all different types of content, all types of marketing and really feel like I'm in a super sweet spot right now. Like I feel super grounded when I'm doing.

[00:01:12.770] - Liz
Good. That's awesome, because I think, you know, we hear over and over again you just got to keep pumping out content. Right? Pinterest wants fresh pins and Google will take notice when you publish this much or whatnot and it's, you know, go, go, go and be on Instagram and do stories. And it's just like it's non stop. And people run themselves in the ground, which is the opposite reason why they started their own business or their own blogs.

[00:01:12.770] - Kim
Absolutely.

[00:01:36.640] - Liz
So, can you tell us kind of your approach to content and what should people drop in  sense?

[00:01:44.410] - Kim
I honestly drop anything you don't enjoy doing and I mean that with every ounce of my being. So, my approach to content, I created this hashtag "everything is content" because it is. And I've done all gamete. First of all, every content that I do that I enjoy doing works and it blows up because I'm having fun doing it. I started a Podcast in 2013, so I wanted to have more fun. It was one of the best things I did for my business. Relationships. I got coaching clients, I got Web clients. I mean, it was crazy because I had fun doing. It was very easy to develop this consistent connection piece. And I love Podcast because it's an intimate content. I think if someone's willing to take me in their ears for like an hour, I'm like, they're they're my ideal tribe. So, I do believe everything is content and picking what you like, but at the same time, like, I really think organic reach is a lot harder on social, not saying not to have a presence. I'm on every platform. I push all my content there. I engage. I like to. I just don't have the bandwidth. And so what works for me- and I'm also, you know, you see a lot of people who start Facebook groups are going all in on Instagram, DMs and stuff. And I had a call with the coaching client yesterday and she's like, she's doing all this manual posting and DMing and Messenger. And I was like, "You got to stop it. It's just it's not sustainable." And she's gotten clients from it. But if you can deploy a little bit of patience, I mean, your best bet is to develop content on assets you own, share from there, but always be driving people back to your website, a place you can get your name and email address, something that's going to support your business goals, not just pushing noise at people.

[00:03:14.740] - Liz
Yeah, Okay. So, you say you still push your content out. Are you doing that via some sort of automated automation or automated tool?

[00:03:25.150] - Kim
Yeah. So we use Co Schedule for both site, my personal brand and a planner, but I also use Missing Letter and so I schedule that stuff out and then I mean, I log into to and I pay attention to alerts, but I just I'm not- I've got a Facebook group that's almost 7000 people. So, I'm in there having conversations, you know, but it's like I've got like over 20,000 followers on Twitter, I retweet stuff, but I'm never on Twitter having conversations. And I'm not anti social media at all, but there's only so much time in the day and I get a better return on email and Podcast. So I do it.

[00:03:59.930] - Liz
Yeah and those are the ones you enjoy, right? I

[00:04:01.660] - Kim
Yeah.

[00:04:01.750] - Liz
If you try to present everything, he'd never actually get around to doing anything on your business. Right.

[00:04:07.450] - Kim
I'm like, I need time to work. So I was I'm like, I got to shut Facebook bye.

[00:04:12.610] - Liz
Okay, so. How often would you say, like, is there some sort of magic formula if you should post at least one blog post a week, or is there what kind of is your approach to that?

[00:04:25.510] - Kim
One piece of content a week is great on again, starting on your site, whether it's your Podcast, because, you know, there's a lot of new ways to Podcast it. But I have my feed generated from my site. I've been doing it so long so I also create a post. Anything that you can do from your site I would start with. And even if you're going to do if you're all in with video and you've got a great YouTube channel, I would do the video, but I would still create a blog post on your site. So, once a week, maybe twice a month- excuse me, once a week or twice a month even. I think you need to start. You need to start. And consistency looks very different. You know, there are some people that can write two or three times a week or there's times where I go through and I do like daily emails. It's a story based email, I'll publish those as blog post often. And so, you know, if you're not doing this and you're trying to come up with a structure and a framework, you have to really be real with yourself and say, what can I be consistent with? And if that's twice a month, do twice a month. And then you make sure to email and to share. You know, it's a lot better to create quality content that you can repurpose and share and get some leverage from as opposed to just pushing out forty  five hundred. Yeah. Yeah, exactly.

[00:05:33.310] - Liz
Gotcha. And quality content is usually going to be longer. It's going to get more SEO juice. There are a lot of benefits to that. So, you talk about repurposing. Would you can you give us some examples of how you would repurpose, like if you worked really hard in a blog post, how would you what would your next steps be? How would you repurpose that so that, again, you're not working yourself into the ground? Work smarter, not harder is my my favorite.

[00:05:56.740] - Kim
You know what my business partner Jodi she's an essential, she's really got me into that, too. So, I mean, there's like micro content that you push to social. So I think absolutely setting that up and sharing that out. But if you do a blog post and you want it to be easy, I love Audiograms. What there's a headliner app or, you know, even Anchor will let you record up to two minutes with transcriptions and you create a video file. So, I would find another type of media that you can create from the post and test that as well and start where you get traction. You know, you mentioned Pinterest earlier on and we had hired someone she was great at to manage the Pinterest count. I did it for my brand and the planner and it was great. She was putting out tons, but the traffic to the site was minimal.

[00:06:39.640] - Liz
Yeah.

[00:06:40.240] - Kim
So it's like I'm working on I'm going to go all in where I'm paying attention and getting the data. So in terms of repurposing, pick one or two other types of media that I do, I think that's ideal.

[00:06:50.920] - Liz
Okay, and there's like if you're not particularly, you know, if you're camera shy or if you're, you know, nervous about recording a Podcast, they're actually tools that will kind of take your blog post and turn it into a video that's like an image and text thing you know, there is stuff you could do like that. So I just I don't want people to be like "I have to get on camera." Podcasting is great, though, because you don't have to do it with video or you could. I actually record my Podcast with video and then I put the video on YouTube.

[00:07:16.360] - Kim
It's funny and I thought about doing that, but I'm like, "I don't want to have to get ready all the time." So, you know... And I'm also at a point where it's like unless it's something that I can sustain and I see a real solid strategy, I don't do it. What I will say to people who don't like being on video or hearing their voice or something, you're not going to get comfortable doing it unless you do it.

[00:07:32.710] - Liz
Yeah.

[00:07:33.160] - Kim
And I think if you can provide- it's kind of like when you have a course, it's great to have a video, it's great to have an audio and it's great to have transcripts. We all learn in different modalities. And so I would recommend, you know, stick with something you know really well. And then can you create a stretch goal? Can you say I'm just going to get comfortable listening to or hearing, my voice or something? You know?

[00:07:52.060] - Liz
Yeah, I record my Podcast because I also don't do makeup very often and mine are also really short and I've started doing where I do like little snippets from the Summit actually as like a teaser in a preview and stuff you learned, you know. So, I really don't have to do much for my podcast.

[00:08:11.950] - Kim
Yes. Mine are an hour long. And it's like, Okay.

[00:08:15.590] - Liz
But, yeah, it kind of just depends on what your goal of it is. Right. So you also mentioned sort of data analysis, because I think that is so crucial. You know, when people are trying to be everywhere, they're not taking the time to figure out what's actually working. How do you go about you using Google Analytics? Are you pulling something into a spreadsheet, some tool to help you see it all? What- how your approach to figuring out what content and content networks are working?

[00:08:40.510] - Kim
Well, Google Analytics for sure. It's a big one. We run paid traffic also for the content creators banner. So, we're looking at that consistently. And Jodi is brilliant with spreadsheets. And we pull all of that because when you're spending money, you really want to look at the data and drill down, not to mention, is the tracking correct? You know, it's funny for my personal brand I do Google Analytics and I've got a plug in in the back of the site where I can look at it. I can't stand logging into Google Analytics, to be honest with you. And then I look at Podcast downloads and the biggest factor is leads. How many leads am I getting and am- I am I driving subscribers and whatnot? And so that's a big one. And so you don't necessarily have to be a data nerd. You don't like- I hate spreadsheets. I hate them. But, you know, you have to measure what's working and I pay. It's like I launched a newsletter and I am obsessed with newsletters lately. We have one for the planner. I feel like there's this rebirth, it's aggregated content, it's value, it's intimate. And so I'm looking at doing the referral program for that. So, I'm already getting the feedback on the newsletter. So, now how do I build in a referral program that I can start generating quality leads from that? So, it's really taking a look at what you like doing, what's working and then drilling down. How can you make it work better? You don't have to keep adding stuff. Can you take what's working and make it work better? And oftentimes you can.

[00:09:54.910] - Liz
Yeah, yeah. That's actually what I'm doing. We're recording this in December and end of year and I'm looking at my processes and I'm like, "Oh, I could do that. I don't need to, you know, that can be automated. This can do that. And that's so much easier." And, you know, I think you've got to be intentional about that. So, we're talking, Okay, you don't need to create as much content. You need to create quality content and then repurpose it. How much time would you say should- I mean, everyone's a little bit different- I know this is an impossible question- but how much time would you say would recommend putting into a piece of content? You know, what does the final result of quality content look like, I guess is probably a better question?

[00:10:36.580] - Kim
Well, the final result, I mean, SEO does play a huge factor in it, right at the same time, I will tell you with my personal brand, I- right- what I've been doing this long enough. I've got an audience and so I do what I want to do, which was really the intention of flipping to the personal brand. We are much more conscientious about SEO on the planner. And so at the same time, I'm also weary of doing all of this. How to do this and how to do that. It's like you buy our plan or if you want to know how to do that. So, there's a fine line between- and I'm just being super like, this is business. We all need to make money. And this provides massive value for, you know, forever. And there's- there's a balance you have to find in there. And so the length of time it takes- I mean, I can spend an entire day on a Podcast for myself because I write two thousand plus word post and then I've got an hour to record it and then I've got to do the post optimization. But I get a lot doing it and I get a ton of leverage from that. And so maybe sort of an epic post. I'll tell you Jody did- we did this marketing checkup and it's gotten Google sheets and stuff link to it. It's like a 5000 word post. It took her a good month.

[00:11:43.170] - Liz
Yeah.

[00:11:43.660] - Kim
To do the research, to write the post and then you go in and you've got to get it. So, it depends on your skill set and it depends on how- are you good at writing? Do you like... There's so many factors that go into it, but I think people just need to be willing to do what it takes. I honestly, I'll tell you, it is easy to succeed in this space if you're willing to stick it out. So many people quit because they think they're supposed to be somewhere in three months, six months. I've been doing this a year, it's like try thirteen. Yeah, it's unless you've got deep pockets for paid traffic or to hire experts, there's a learning curve. Master the craft and you'll enjoy the journey a lot more.

[00:12:17.860] - Liz
Yeah. And I always say, if you're kind of if you've been doing it consistently for a year, you'll- you'll get there, you know, that first year the hardest. But if you- you know, and then I think also even five thousand word post like that done is better than perfect. You can always go back and edit things later. Like that's my motto is that is done is better than perfect. Just get it out there.

[00:12:34.900] - Kim
Imperfect action all the time. I'm right there with you.

[00:12:38.410] - Liz
Okay, so you know, and I think that that speaks volumes of it. It makes you want to write a massive, incredible post. It's five thousand words and you're only posting once  a month it's fine. Like if that's kind of where you want to be, like Google going to eat up five word posts, a lot better than seventeen five hundred workers.

[00:12:55.600] - Kim
Absolutely. Nice math. Yeah, absolutely. You know.

[00:12:58.600] - Liz
It's 10,500 posts. But let's just say you really are publishing multiple times a week, right.

[00:13:03.790] - Kim
Yeah. It absolutely is, and the other thing is, like we're talking about repurposing, if you're going to go to the trouble, if writing is a good space for you, I mean, medium is a golden opportunity. Still, I pay for medium. I subscribe to it. I get so much great content and I don't mean this dismissively. I like all mediums of content, but I feel that people that read medium or subscribe to newsletters, can tend to be a higher quality lead. Not negating the person, but a higher quality lead if they're willing to take the time to read, to be honest with you.

[00:13:35.910] - Liz
Yeah, so if you're in the space of trying to offer a service, then that's a great way to go about it. You know, if you're doing a small digital product, you know, it's going to vary. But if you hate writing, don't or do like dictation. If you're better at talking. Like, I've actually busted out lots of long post- entire courses just by doing dictation and not even the fancy tool, just like Google Docs microphone.

[00:13:59.190] - Kim
Yeah, totally. Totally.

[00:14:01.560] - Liz
Yeah. Okay, so what other advice do you have for people struggling to keep up with content wheel I guess. Well I think you cut it. This is going to be a little bit, I don't know, draw a line in the sand. There comes a point where you have to say, "I can't do it all." You have to. I think there's a level of self responsibility that people miss because they see other people, what they're doing. And it's like you don't you have no idea. You know, we see the winds. We see this highlight reels. We see what's happening. You've no idea how much time and energy was put into what you're seeing. And so I think you have to draw a line in the sand and make a commitment in terms of what can I do, what can I realistically be consistent with? And it's all the stuff that's not sexy, right? I mean, being consistent with writing emails is not necessarily sexy, but it's friggin works.

[00:14:46.800] - Kim
And so, like the other thing I would recommend because and I wish I had done this because truly we we make money. Every single email we sell, email marketing works. And, you know, there's so many different ways to do this. But I want people to pay attention to what are their business goals and are they creating assets because all of your audience is on social. You own them? Not at all. You know, so you have to really develop that relationship. The other piece in terms of the content overwhelm and it sounds esoteric, but you have to do what you enjoy.

[00:15:16.980] - Kim
You're not going to stick with something if it if you hate it at the same time, you're not going to get good at something by not doing it.

[00:15:23.310] - Liz
True.

[00:15:23.770] - Kim
Yeah.

[00:15:24.000] - Liz
So something there's a difference between hating it and something that's outside your comfort zone.

[00:15:27.840] - Kim
Yeah.

[00:15:28.450] - Liz
You're like that's kind of what we're talking about here, but like you're uncomfortable doing it, keep doing it. If you're like "I hate this", walk away.

[00:15:35.790] - Kim
Yeah. Well, and I also think, you know, it's funny because the one thing I've said to people like if  I could recommend one thing to anybody, it would it is to get good at writing.

[00:15:43.740] - Liz
And I'm not talking about the next great novel. I'm talking about writing that gets people to take an action. I mean copywriting. I hated copy and I've kind of fallen in love with it over the last couple of years. So, you know, as an example, there's a story behind by Donald Miller Jody. I spent six hours on the Zoom developing our story brand for the content creators final before we launched it. We have never had to revisit what this looks like, like it's solid copy.

[00:16:09.240] - Kim
We put copy from the site all the time from our ads we've done all the time because we took the time to do that. So you have to. And that's hard when it's not a comfort level. But there is a simple headline can make or break a course launch completely. And so when you start looking at how words impact people's actions, consume your content to opt in, to buy whatever it gets exciting. They get sexy.

[00:16:34.080] - Liz
It does. It does. And we do have sessions on copyright people should check out and Story Brand is an excellent book. I read it. Okay, so how do you because I mean, you have an amazing planner. How do you approach planning content then? Right. Because you don't necessarily know that that 5000 word post going to take you a month. How do you approach kind of planning what you want your content to be towards your goals?

[00:16:55.860] - Kim
Well, we we approach it from what can I- so we've got business goals. Right. And that's how the planner works. But it's then what content supports reaching those that really comes back to that. And here's what is is fascinating to me, which with work. So, we have this newsletter that we put out, Creativity Publishers Weekly, and we publish a new post and there's two of us. Right. So, we alternate over the week.

[00:17:16.050] - Liz
Yeah.

[00:17:16.380] - Kim
But what's been interesting and because I've really made a conscious point of I'm not going to do massive how to content, when the how to is what they should hire us for or buy our product from.

[00:16:55.860] - Liz
Yeah.

[00:17:26.580] - Kim
But there's relationship content and there's teaching a little bit. So what we do is it we can be consistent with. So we do a post every week, we do the newsletter every week and that's that's great content. We want to do a Podcast for the planner. We'll get there. We've done a couple of false starts of it. Just don't- we both have our own businesses too. So, in terms of planning of a content strategy, start with tangible, measurable goals. I want to add three hundred subscribers to my list this week. I want to book five coaching sessions, whatever it is.

[00:17:54.810] - Liz
Yeah.

[00:17:55.110] - Kim
What content supports...

[00:17:56.580] - Liz
Work backwards.

[00:17:57.120] - Kim
Right. Work backwards. Yeah.

[00:17:58.770] - Liz
Yeah. Because you don't want to be publishing content just to publish content. I mean you can maybe at first as you're getting traction on your site to get that Google SEO and all that stuff, but really do it with a goal in mind, whether that's an affiliate link click or like you said, subscribe to your newsletter signing up for a service or product, because even if you're a beginner, have some sort of strategy coming in with your content. Don't just- I mean, I didn't when I started, but learn from my mistakes, right?

[00:18:26.140] - Kim
Yeah, yeah. That's how you that's how you learn. And the other piece of that, though, I will say I write a lot of content just because I feel like it on my brand, because I've been at this a long time. I've got an audience, I've got an email list. And so sometimes there is that opinion piece that can resonate with people as well. So I don't want people to think that- one of my best posts has nothing to do with SEO or content at all.

[00:18:50.490] - Liz
Yeah,

[00:18:50.730] - Kim
It had to do with a personal story and it was something people didn't know. And it was it got the most comments, the most shares, the most traffic. And so but so there's a lot of ways that your content can serve your audience. So, you know, don't be afraid to just write an opinion piece because you've got a thought on something as long as it supports your business, your brand and provides value. Yeah, no, I think that's a great point.

[00:19:14.580] - Liz
Again, on my first site that I started, which is still around, which as been a little dormant lately. Like my most popular content is how I don't like the other. It's a personal finance, how I don't like this other personal finance approach that's out there. And like people are like, you don't want to attract everyone. That's not going to work for you. So, make sure you shine through with your opinion and your personality. I do that in my emails on my site and my like footers where I'm like, "Hey, these are causes I support." And you don't necessarily have to be that, you know, in-depth or political necessarily, you know, because I know there is a lot of divisiveness there. But you can say, you know, "I don't like this. This is just my approach. And if you're you know, there's nothing wrong with that. That's just not my cup of tea." You can kind of move on from there.

[00:20:01.530] - Kim
Absolutely. There's a there was a quote, I think, of Danielle Porton, and she said, "Love me, hate me, but don't be..." excuse me. "don't be indifferent."

[00:20:10.260] - Liz
Yes.

[00:20:11.040] - Kim
And so because I'll tell you what, it's very easy to draw a big list of just random people. And it all comes back to that one thousand true fans. I'd rather have a thousand true fans than one hundred thousand who are indifferent.

[00:20:21.990] - Liz
Yeah. Who don't care. That's why you shouldn't do like giveaways of like twenty five dollar Amazon card. You could get a hundred thousand subscribers that way, but it's not really going to do you any good. Yeah.

[00:20:31.390] - Kim
It's like a BuzzFeed quiz. It's like just don't.

[00:20:34.350] - Liz
Yes. Okay, so any- I mean I feel like we're kind of covered a lot of really good points. Do you have some specific examples of kind of taking parts of content and using them elsewhere? I know you said you can make a video, but do you do that with your whole piece of content? Do you do snippets? Are you doing just the conclusion? Can you kind of get into some of the nitty gritty?

[00:20:31.390] - Kim
A little bit? Yeah. So when I go to schedule stuff, I will pull out text. I mean, with Kosko Tool missing letter, I try to bury the text in the images all year long campaign for that. So, I mean that's really that's kind of it. I just pull out different snippets. I don't go is Grayndler. I'd like to do one of the things I want to do with a test and just create one really piece of good content and see what happens when you dedicate thirty days to giving it the leverage it needs. And in that case, then it would I would record a separate audio if it's not a Podcast effort episode, recorded separate audio, maybe do a talking head video really quick, driving people back to the post and then a handful of social images. Again, it depends on where you're at in your journey and how much traffic you have to your site and your email. I mean, don't misuse- not misuse. Don't forget that email. I mean, always drive people back to your content creator email, you know, so it's it's one of those things that you have to be in a place where it's share it on places that you engage. So, the granular details of how you do that, it depends on how well you've written a post, because sometimes you can copy and paste a paragraph and put it in social sharing and there's no context. It doesn't make sense. You're going to edit it and tweak it. So, micro content pushing socially is like phase two of creating the content and, you know, and so I would just like people to realize it's a long game. Content is a long game.

[00:22:16.740] - Kim
The other piece not to miss. So, if you're going to go to the trouble to write a two to five thousand word post that provides massive value, put some money behind it and send traffic to it with an opt-in I mean, don't be afraid to test that to see if that resonates. Paid traffic from Facebook to an opt in is a lot cheaper than to a sales page. And and so you need to get some of those little wins. And yet you see people buying two thousand dollar courses. I'm like, "spend two thousand dollars on ads."

[00:22:42.480] - Liz
Yeah.

[00:22:43.780] - Kim
And I'm not saying there's not a time and a place, but the bottom line is, like everything works, webinars work, videos work, but you have to get good at one or two, get them working and then decide if you want to add another vehicle.

[00:22:55.720] - Liz
Yeah, shiny object syndrome can be a downfall and something that really slows your progress. Like, yes, you want to invest in yourself and learning and shortening that learning curve. But there's there's a fine line. You know, no amount of tools are going to make up for the fact that you haven't written a post in two months. No, amount.

[00:23:12.860] - Kim
Exactly. Yeah, I had a friend who was like, "Oh, my list is a bust", because she went to email her list, this course that she's had out for a year and a half or whatever. And I'm like, " When was the last time you emailed them." Yeah. Has it been this year because they're cold? They haven't heard from you. They're not going to buy your course when you haven't communicated with them, so. So logic, but I kind of think that the shiny object syndrome is sort of like the movie tax that people pay. I think we've all been through that. Right. And then you get to the point where it's like, "I don't have time to go through anymore courses. So until I finish this one, I don't care how appealing this is. I'm not spending a penny on it."

[00:23:49.500] - Liz
Yeah, yeah. No, no, that's a great point. Oh my gosh. The number of courses I have is ridiculous. And like and I've done. I went through period for like a year or two where I just was constantly, you know, I was taking them. But some of these courses depending, they're like I literally there was one course that I spent a good chunk of money on. It took me a year to get through that course, working on it consistently, you know. So recognize what? You're not just investing money. You have to invest the time. And so if you are short on time already, keep that in mind. So, I think absolutely a good point. You can still totally get one of the upgrade passes to the Summit because we've got a session for beginner intermediate level. So, it'll grow with you. But if you have like one hundred other courses that you want to get through, maybe hold off, well that's kay. But yeah, Okay. So we've covered a good amount of stuff I think would hopefully help people adjust their mindset and expectations of what they can do. You don't have to do everything, do what works right. Like if you only focus on two channels and that's like SEO and social like that's fine. So, any final tips before we tell them about something you've got for them? But any final tips?

Have fun with it you guys, seriously, content is not this. And I get it there are people that a chiropractor is like, "I'm a chiropractor. I want to create content, hire somebody that likes to create content." And, you know, but it's just this is not supposed to be- I don't know if people take themselves too seriously. It's so much better to show up and be consistent and get the data and figure out what works. I mean, you get clarity through the doing. So just do it,

[00:25:23.480] - Liz
Okay? Yes. And then can you tell us what you have or the link is below, but tell you want to tell them about it?

[00:25:29.840] - Kim
Yeah, it's a free workshop. It's called Seven Ways to Create a create, promote and profit with your content. So, it's an hour long training, but there's tons of tangible examples of different types of content. The different set, the seven steps that will incorporate if your idea stuck with it's funny, like entrepreneurs are never lacking ideas, but when it comes to content, it's kind of like, what do I do? So, it'll really walk you through that whole process.

[00:25:52.070] - Liz
