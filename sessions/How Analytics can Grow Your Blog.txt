Liz Stapleton [00:00:00]:
Okay. Thank you so much for joining us for the session with Jenn Zellers from Virtual Summit Search. Welcome, Jenn. I appreciate you doing this.

Jenn Zellers [00:00:08]:
Hi. I'm excited to be here.

Liz Stapleton [00:00:10]:
Yes. And we're you're gonna be digging into Google Analytics and how can I help you grow your blog, because I feel like when people start a blog, they're like, told, okay, install Google Analytics, and then it, like, stops there. But Google Analytics is so powerful. You can do so much with it. So, yeah, I'm really excited. You know, anything you wanna sort of add before you dive into things?

Jenn Zellers [00:00:33]:
Yeah. So just a quick overview of what I'm planning to cover today. I want to talk about how do you use Google analytics to increase your traffic to what we all want to do, make more money, and monetize your blog. even get more content and blog post ideas. And the 2 of my favorites are figuring out how to better leverage your social media and track your goal your website. So that's what we're gonna be talking about today.

Liz Stapleton [00:00:57]:
Yes. Well, I, I have to admit. I have our own set goals. Like, it I'm like, oh, I need to. I really should I know I can. So I'm excited to learn something from your session as well. So I actually can can get mine set up the way it should be. So Alright.

Liz Stapleton [00:01:12]:
Let's go ahead and dive in. I'm super pumped. Here we go.

Jenn Zellers [00:01:16]:
Okay. So this is the first screen that you're going to see when you log into Google Analytics most of the time. It's just Google's kinda quick home page overview of what's going on on your website. So as you can see, there are active users, and that just shows who's actually on your website right now and what page do you mean? A quick overview of the last 7 days of your traffic, things like that. we're not gonna go into this too much because we're going to go into other things. So the first thing you're gonna wanna do is if you well, if you haven't set up Google Analytics already, you're gonna wanna do that. but this is assuming you have set up Google Analytics. If you haven't, just come back to this after you have, set it up.

Jenn Zellers [00:02:01]:
And first thing we're going to do is set up some goals because this is going to be important for all the other things that we are going to talk So you'll go over here to the left hand menu and click admin. And I'm using a client's Google Analytics to demo this. So we are going to go over to their goals. And as you can see, there's already a couple of, goals set up So I am going to show you how to set those up for yourself now. So you go into here, click new goal. And the first one we're gonna wanna do is pages per session. So you'll click custom. Continue evening with whatever you want.

Jenn Zellers [00:02:38]:
That'd be pages per session. you'll click the pages presentation down there. That's all pretty self explanatory so far. and then here, you'll want to set it to greater than 1. So what that'll do is make it so that anyone who views at least two pages on your website, whether it's a blog post or about page, whatever it happens to be, it will show up as a success, a conversion on this goal. So then you want to verify this goal. And what this does is it checks your traffic from the last 7 days and sees if it will would have, converted on the goal. So in this case, it shows that Centella Studio, which is this, the site that I'm using for this would have had almost 10 a half percent conversions.

Jenn Zellers [00:03:24]:
So that means 10 a percent of the people who visited the site, visited at least two pages during their visit. You also see this value, thing we're going to ignore that for right now just because pages per session is not a super great metric of if people are going to convert to paying customers. So we're going to leave that for right now. You would then click save. In this case, I'm not going to just because I already have this goal set up. So I don't actually want to set it up. But once you hit save, or in my case, cancel. You'll see that that goal is now in your goals list.

Jenn Zellers [00:04:04]:
I'm also gonna show you how to set up the email opt ins. before I do that, I just wanna tell you a quick thing about the goals per session. The reason that that's important is because it measure. It's it kinda gives you a good metric for how engaged people are on your site. If they're clicking to multiple pages, it means that they like what they've seen. and maybe they're clicking off of a blog post onto your About me page or whatever it is. And they're just trying to learn more about you and what you're you're doing on your blog. So that's a great first metric to see how much, engagement you're getting on your site.

Jenn Zellers [00:04:41]:
The email opt ins, of course, is important because as a blogger, you're trying to grow your email list. Like, that is one of the things you're over and over and over again. So You wanna make sure that your email's, list is converting from your blog post and your other pages. So to set this up, we're going to go to new goal again. and I'm going to go to custom once again. And you can leave it whenever you want me to email list You'll go to destination and continue. And then this is where you may have to do a little bit of back end setup if you don't already have a thank you page. So In this case, what you want the thank you patient to do is once they have given you their name and email address, most email marketing providers will let you set up a redirect so that, once they send you that, it'll automatically redirect them to a page in this case, the thank you page.

Jenn Zellers [00:05:33]:
and you might just say, hey, thanks for joining. So I'm so excited to have you. here's a good place to start and get them, like, to take some blog posts that most people are interested in whatever it happens to be, maybe ask them to share. But whatever it is, you wanna have that thank you page set up. So that you'll go ahead and grab the URL for that thank you page and put it in here. You only want the part of the URL that is after your domain name. So in this case, cintilla.studio/thank-you is their thank you page, but you don't want to put the actual domain name. That's where it's gonna think dash u.

Jenn Zellers [00:06:12]:
And, it'll remind you down here not to put the domain name in because Google will automatically add that for you. This is somewhere where you may want to use the value option. so say you have, you know, a certain amount of your subscribers, maybe 20% will, pay you for your $5 trip wire product or whatever it happens to be. So an email subscriber would be worth a dollar because that's 20 percent of the 5. So you could assign it a $1 value, and that just kinda helps you see which pages are giving you the most value and the most return on investment if, say, you're spending money on ads. We're gonna ignore the funnel for right now. then we're gonna verify it. In this case, we they don't have a lot of data set up on the thank you page right now.

Jenn Zellers [00:07:02]:
So theirs shows a 0%, but yours may show more than that. And that's fine. And if you haven't set up your thank you page, of course, you are gonna see 0% It doesn't necessarily mean that you set it up wrong, but if in, say, 7 to 30 days, depending on how much traffic you get, you're still not seeing conversions, you may want to come back and take a look and just make sure you did set it up right. So you would hit save. I'm gonna hit cancel because, again, I've already got it set up, and I know it'll show up right there. You can come in here for a quick overview of the conversions on these goals from the last 7 days. So in this case, we just set up the pages per session goal for them today.

Jenn Zellers [00:07:45]:
You've already had 7 conversions, so that's not bad. so, yeah, that's setting up your goals. Like I said, you can do a lot of things with goals, but we're not gonna get into them right now because I could go down a rabbit hole on that [inaudible]. So, okay. We're gonna go ahead and move on. So the next thing we're gonna look at is your traffic because everybody wants to get more traffic to your blog. That's how you get money. That's how you get your email subscribers.

Jenn Zellers [00:08:13]:
So we'll start right there. So the first report that you're gonna wanna look at inside of Google Analytics is your source slash medium. That may sound weird. I'll explain in just a minute to get there, though. You're going to go over to acquisition once you're back in your main Google analytics, which can get you by clicking home. So acquisition, all traffic, and then source slash medium. And in here, you will see all the different page or all the different places that you're getting traffic from. So in this case, you'll see that interest in Google are the top refer, are the top traffic sources for Centella Studio.

Jenn Zellers [00:08:49]:
And then you'll see this direct traffic. And all that means is that it's traffic that is something that Google can't track either they're typing in the URL manually, they're coming to it from a bookmark. Maybe they came to the blog post in the past and saved it for later on their browser bookmarks or it's just something that Google doesn't have enough information to tell you where it came from. So, unfortunately, it's not super helpful for figuring out where your traffic sources are, but those pages will still show up in other reports. So it is still useful in the long run. And what you'll wanna do here is just keep an eye out from which places are sending you the most traffic And that's typically where you wanna put the most effort and possibly money if that's something you're doing into. You will also see so that's what sources. sources like Pinterest, Google, Facebook, that sort of thing.

Jenn Zellers [00:09:43]:
And you will also see this like referral and organic and stuff like that. referral just means that it's a website that referred traffic to you. So Pinterest refers traffic via their pins, Facebook refers traffic via the link on Facebook posts, Instagram, camera, bio, all that kind of good stuff. that is something where you may see direct traffic. So if you have traffic from Instagram, and you're putting a link in the post itself that would end up showing up as direct traffic. But there are ways around that you have to use campaigns not gonna get into that right now. Just know that it is possible to track that and see where it does come from Instagram or places like that. You will also wanna keep an eye out for really weird looking websites.

Jenn Zellers [00:10:27]:
If you see something that you're like, what's the dot org or whatever, which I don't actually know. I've never seen that one. Don't necessarily go and go to that website. A lot of the time, that can be spam, and it's coming from automatic bots, and it can go to really bad sites that could have viruses If you really wanna know what it is, go to Google or another search engine and type in what is and then paste in that URL, and just make sure that it's legit before you actually go look at it because you don't want that things to happen to your computer or your website. so that's just a little caveat with the traffic sources just be careful. okay. So from there, we are going to move on to finding your best and worst performing pages and posts. So we're actually going to stay in this same report.

Jenn Zellers [00:11:21]:
We're going to click other though. and then click landing page. So you'll type in landing of however much of it, and then just click it. Excuse me. And then this is going to show you which actual pages are getting traffic. Sorry. So you can see he's got a blog post on songwriting, a blog posts on how to create a a computer wallpaper, some other posts down here, and those are getting the most traffic. So the top 3 right there are definitely his best performing posts there at least double what all the other ones are getting.

Jenn Zellers [00:11:57]:
So you in thoughts based on users anyway. So what users are is the unique, people. So, like, the unique IP addresses, which I know is technical, essentially as Google knows if someone is busy. And, again, that's really what it comes down to. So, that's just the individual people rather than the number of pages that they're viewing or the number of times they're coming, which is what sessions is. So session is when they do one or more pages within a certain time frame. and if they leave or if they're inactive, 30 minutes, then it counts as a new session, but Google knows, oh, they already visited. So they don't count as a new user.

Jenn Zellers [00:12:40]:
So that's why you'll see that There's a 1055 users, but there's 1149 sessions because some people came back again later. So when you're looking for your best performing pages, you can either show up by users or sessions. It automatically, like, by default, sorts by users. So we're just gonna continue with that. to find the worst performing pages, you would click users again. And in this case, most of the, like, late less performing pages only have one user, so we're not gonna go with that. with this case, but if you have pages that are getting my my guideline is usually about 10% of the best performing pages. So in this case, I would say if he's getting 15 to 20 or, thereabouts that they get minimum, that many pay users visiting those pages, those are really great ones to be able to optimize to increase the traffic.

Jenn Zellers [00:13:41]:
So in this case, he might go and take all of his 4 through 10, most trafficked blog posts and go ahead and work on that search engine optimization, go ahead and promote them more, just make them more valuable for people so they're more likely to stick around. and look at other pages. So you can actually see if they have looked at other pages with your goals over here. So in this case, you can actually see that the creative excuses blog post, someone went and went to more than one page when they were there. And the same thing for the finishing map tutorial that he has. He got more than one person to go to another page for that. So that's a great way to see which ones are actually doing well to you and not just having someone come, look at it and leave, which is called a bounce. And, oh, one other quick note, this little slash here, that just means it's your home page.

Jenn Zellers [00:14:38]:
so if you see that That's all that is. It doesn't mean it's broken or anything. so and if you click these, it'll open up the blog post in another tab. So okay. so that's the best and worst performing post and how to use them to increase traffic. The best performing post, you just wanna make the most out of them, increase the SEO even if you can. get one eyeballs on in as much as you can, which actually brings me to my next point, which is, I'll make more money using your Google Analytics data. So we're actually gonna stick right here because you want to optimize your best performing posts.

Jenn Zellers [00:15:19]:
The ones that are already getting a lot of eyeballs are going to be more likely to have enough people to convert them to paying customers. Typically, the best way to start with that when you're blogging is picking affiliate links, which you probably already know, but I'll just say it again. So find your best performing posts and find ways to add affiliate links to them in a way that doesn't feel salesy. So, for example, the, songwriting tutorial that he has, he could go and find some books on Amazon that relate to that. he could link them to some sheet music that they could buy, like blank sheet music or whatever. and things like that for the wallpaper, the wallpaper tutorial, maybe there are some software that you could recommend for people who use to make that, things like that. So if you get a little bit creative with the things that you can link to as affiliate links, and maybe you're doing like a lifestyle blog and it's really easy because you're showing your outfit you can just go link to where you bought that during affiliate links. But the more creative you can get, the better it'll be, and don't forget to include your disclaimer.

Jenn Zellers [00:16:28]:
because if you don't, that can get you into legal trouble. I know you probably already know that, but, again, just gotta say it. So that is a really great way to increase your blog income without having to do a ton of work. There are even some, some plugins that you can get. Like, there's a plugin by TC pins that will automatically add a link. You give a keyword and you give it the affiliate link or any a basic link, even and it will automatically go through and add that to every, every time that that keyword shows up. And Then you only have to go in and update that link once inside of the plugin, and it will update it again in your blog post. So that can be a really great way to easily optimize your affiliate income.

Jenn Zellers [00:17:15]:
another thing that you can do is find search queries. So we're going to move on to that. So you will go to, search console and inquiries. Over here in the acquisition tab, And then this will show you all of the search engine queries. So things that people type into Google or Bing or whatever search engine they're using. And, unfortunately, Google can only show you a certain number of them. A lot of people have blockers that they use on their browsers, but Even the amount of traffic or data that you can get from this can be might be useful in the long run. So One of the best ways to make more money with this is maybe you have a blog post that is not getting a ton of traffic but is getting a lot of search traffic.

Jenn Zellers [00:18:04]:
And search traffic can actually be one of the best traffic to get if you're trying to monetize your blog because People that are searching for things are looking for answers and results. And if you can provide those answers and results, they're much more likely to buy the things that you recommend to achieve that. So in this case, again, the minimalist art wallpaper, is something that was one of his top posts, but it's also getting a lot of search traffic. And so you can go in here and figure out which ones are getting the most search. And you can optimize those to get even better search engine results and add affiliate links to them even if they're not your top post, because if you can get people that are more likely to actually buy things, obviously, you're gonna make more money even if you're getting less traffic. And then another thing that I hear a lot is how do I find content ideas? Because when you're blogging, you're coming up with a lot of ideas, and you have to write a lot of content in order to keep your blog going. So where do you figure out what to do with that? And this can actually be a really great place to do that.

Jenn Zellers [00:19:14]:
So you'll note that this shows you how many clicks each, search query has gotten. So people have searched how to make minimalist art, and he's done 18 clicks out of that. but there are other ways to find data from search and inquiries. So we yeah. You're gonna go. And we're going to be in the search console still, and we're gonna go to landing pages this time. So what we're doing here is this will show you the actual pages that are showing up in search results. So you'll notice the multi classing and everything, which If you don't speak nerd, that's a Dungeons And Dragons reference.

Jenn Zellers [00:19:53]:
I'm I'm one of those nerds, so I say that with love but that is a blog post that gets tons of traffic, there are lots of nerds searching for multi classing, apparently. And it doesn't show you the queries. but it shows you that this has shown up in almost 14,000 searches, but it's only gotten 50 clicks over the last 30 days. which is really low. And you can tell that because this CTR, which stands for a click through rate, is only 0.36% versus this minimalist wallpaper, which is over 6%. So that's a great one to be able to optimize. to find more content, to get more traffic to it.

Jenn Zellers [00:20:34]:
so he could optimize that post itself to get traffic, but You can also take that and find contents that is related to that in order to get more traffic to that type of post. So if people are searching for multiclassing, he might be able to find other related terms. So if you go back to search queries. We can go ahead and sort by impressions. And impressions is, how many times it's showing up in a search query. So in this case, 5e multi classing has shown at 677 times. So that would relate back to that blog post. And if you can find something a different angle to take on 5th edition multi classing, for dungeons, and dragons, He could probably get a lot more traffic to that type of post because a lot of people are searching for it.

Jenn Zellers [00:21:25]:
And you'll notice that the 4th result is pretty much the same thing backwards. So we're doing a little bit of digging, a little bit of sleuthing to find the things that are getting a lot of traffic to searches but aren't resulting in traffic for you. Those can be really great ways to find you content ideas because Those are people that want the content you have, but they're not seeing it. And you can actually tell that they're not seeing it because coming back to here, you can see this average position column. So what that means is where it shows up in search results. So if you do a search on Google, you'll see that there are ten, I mean, there's ads and then there's, like, 10 results of actual results. And so there's about 10 results per page Your goal is to have an average position of 10 or less because that means you are reliably showing up in the top 10 search results and let's be real when most people don't go past the first page of Google results anymore because Google's gotten really good at showing me what you actually want to see. So in this case, this multi crossing and everything is showing up on the 3rd page of the search results typically, which means most people are not seeing it, which explains why he hasn't gotten a lot of clicks.

Jenn Zellers [00:22:42]:
And ironically, this minimal wallpaper is getting an average position of 31, which puts it on the 4th page of the search results. But what that actually tells you is that there's a percentage of the time where it is showing up in probably that first 10, position, like, 1 through 10. And then the rest of the time is probably showing up more like 50 or something like that, and so it averages out to that middle ground. but he's got a lot of clicks, a lot of sessions out of that. And so that is something that maybe there are other topics around that that he could fill and optimize for it as well. yeah, that that's one of my favorite ways to find content ideas is going to seem what people are searching for, what not actually finding you for, and optimizing around that. The other thing you can do is go and see which pages have been getting the most traffic over the last 3 months or so. So I'm gonna come back to here, and we've got the landing pages pulled up still.

Jenn Zellers [00:23:48]:
And we are going to Okay. So I'll go to 10th October. And, you can see that this blog post has gotten the most traffic. So what you can do there is go into the blog post and see if there's a piece of that that you could expand on more. So maybe there is one of these in this case of creative excuses that he could talk about more and find a slightly different keyword and just get more traffic out of that. It's in the min minimalist wallpaper. Again, clearly, this is a really good one. he could go in there and maybe see what other kinds of art tutorials you could find to do because people clearly like that and just kinda getting creative with the different things you can do.

Jenn Zellers [00:24:42]:
So it's really similar to the search queries, but just a little bit different because you're going off of what is actually getting traffic. because that way you can link back to it in new post that's getting traffic and hopefully increase your pages per session and things like that. Okay. And the other thing you wanna do is make sure your demographics are enabled. That's something that you would think people would automatically do, we do have to turn it on. I have a little lesson that in Google Analytics 101, so I'm not gonna go into it too much here. And but last but not least, one thing that I get lost a lot about is social media because Everybody's on social media. Everyone wants to know how to get more traffic out of social media.

Jenn Zellers [00:25:26]:
So let's move on to that. So to get to the social media report, you're going to go to acquisition, social, and then network referrals is usually the best reports you see for us. So this is where we're at. You can see that over the last 30 days, he's gotten traffic from Pinterest a little tiny bit from Facebook and one from reddit, so Pinterest is queen of the giants in social media world force into the studio. And, what that means is that you need to analyze that a bit more. So to analyze it a bit more, you just have to click on that particular social network. and it will open up another report. And this one is gonna show you the actual pages that have gotten from your different pinterest.

Jenn Zellers [00:26:09]:
So These 3 are getting pretty significant traffic from Pinterest. These ones not so much. Partly becaus nano arrival within November. but this will go ahead and show you how many sessions are getting page views. And then the most important one in my book is the session duration and pages per session. So the session duration is how long someone actually spends on your website. If it's less than a minute, most likely they're not reading your blog post, it should be at least 30 seconds to a minute to qualify as a solid visit in my book.

Jenn Zellers [00:26:46]:
This can vary depending on like, what kind of topics you're talking about, if it's something where they're just giving it to you, see if your kids are whatever it might be, maybe they are spending less time. But if you're doing tutorials or recipes or anything like that, most likely they're going to need to be on the page for longer than, you know, 6 seconds. And you also wanna see pages per session that are higher than 1 because you're hoping that people are going to more than one page off of this. So if you're doing recipes, make sure you're linking to your complimentary recipes that they may wanna try. If you have outfits, like, doing a lifestyle blog, bring back to other blog posts that related to that as well. Tutorials, there are always different tutorials that you can link back to So things like that to keep in mind your site longer is always good. And this is also something that is very important when it comes to social media because You may be getting a lot of traffic from it, but is it actually quality traffic? Because in this case, you can see the pages per session, which is one of the goals we set up, but you cannot see the email conversions. So I'm going to go and show you real quick how to do that.

Jenn Zellers [00:28:01]:
So we're going to come back to this source slash medium report. And I left down the landing pages because that's what we really care about. Actually, no. Sorry. I was wrong. I'm gonna go to source slash medium after all. Okay. So once we're back to here, what you can do is say we wanna analyze the Pinterest traffic more.

Jenn Zellers [00:28:20]:
You're gonna click this little enhanced link here. And you'll notice it. Hang on. Okay. So you want to set it to include and leave it with source slash medium containing. And in this case, since we want to include all Pinterest traffic regardless of how it shows up in Google, because in just a second, see that it shows up differently depending on where it's coming from, see this type of Pinterest and click apply. There's a lot of different options, but you don't need them right now. So hit apply and you'll notice that now it, knocks out everything from Google and Bing and Facebook and everything else.

Jenn Zellers [00:28:58]:
We just have Pinterest So this is where making sure it's just pinterest, not, pinterest.com is important because you've got the regular pinterest.com, which is typically in the US, Then you've got, like, Canada and the UK and maybe this is Zambia. I'm not sure. we've got, like, France down here and things like that. So making sure that you are including everything that's relevant can be really important. So now you can come over here to the conversion section and see if there are conversions. We're gonna go to the pages per session because I know we don't have any emails right now. And as you can see, this one, which leaves Spain or Estonia. I don't know.

Jenn Zellers [00:29:41]:
All the different Pinterest sites are really confusing, but that particular version of Pinterest is giving 25% conversions to people who are saying for at least two pages. Whereas from the US, we're getting 0.24%, which is really sad. and again, this is also pretty a pretty new goal, so it doesn't have all the information from the previous week necessarily, which is why this other one is actually really helpful because then even if you don't have your, your goal set up quite yet, you can still see if it's getting good pages per session. But if you want to see the email opt in rate, you can go into here And, again, this one doesn't have any yet, but if you have your setup and you've had your thank you page set up, then you would be able to see Is Pinterest actually giving the email convergence? Because, you know, maybe you don't actually care if there is any more than one page on Pinterest because typically, Pinterest is a high bounce rate, which means a lot of people come from Pinterest. Look at the blog. They'll say, okay. That sounds good. We've almost immediately and then go save it on Pinterest.

Jenn Zellers [00:30:49]:
Do you you later, which lets me really probably won't. So you wanna find ways, especially with interest, to make sure that you're getting more value out of the visits. So you could go and get your email options like, hey. Don't save this for later. Let me help you implement this now and things like that. So checking to make sure that you are converting for some type of goal is really helpful because maybe you're putting a ton of time in the Pinterest. Maybe you're on there the 2 hours a day And then once you have your goal set up and you've got some data flow and then you're realizing, it's not actually doing anything for you. It's not making you money.

It's not getting you email subscribers. and maybe go down to, like, 15, 30 minutes a day because if it's not making you any return on that investment of time, It may not be worth it. So and maybe you're getting more traffice from Instagram or at least it's higher quality traffic. So that's just a little caveat, a little bit of a soapbox just because you're getting a lot of traffic from a particular traffic source, whether it's Pinterest or Google or whatever, it doesn't mean that it's quality traffic. It doesn't mean it's traffic that's going to get you any money or email subscribers or whatever other goals you have for your blog. So be really careful about investing time into traffic sources that do not actually get you anything in return. So this is why I had to set up your goals first because if you have those goals, it's a lot easier to tell if you're getting that return on investment. when you're putting your time into something.

Wow. That was super awesome, Jenn. Thank you so much for sharing all that super helpful information. I can't wait to dive into my Google Analytics. any final words for people watching the summit?

Jenn Zellers [00:32:52]:
I guess just that if you haven't sat figured out how to install your Google analytics, or if you haven't done some of the little things that a lot of people miss like setting up your demographics and your search console because those are not automatically in your Google Analytics account. I've got a quick freebie that you can download, so make sure to press that too.

Yes. So grab that and then your, your Google Analytics 101 as well to help people dive even further. So thank you so much. I appreciate it.
