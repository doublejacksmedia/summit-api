And, also, stay tuned till the very end because I've got a special gift for you, a $150 value, but I'm gonna go over that towards the end. So stay tuned on how to get it. A little bit about me, my name is Amira Irfan. I am the business lawyer, entrepreneur, and coach over at aselfguru.com. I have been known to help entrepreneurs legally protect their businesses. I've been doing that for a decade now.

Amira Irfan [00:00:47]:
I've helped thousands of entrepreneurs legally protect their businesses with my either my legal templates or working with me 1 on 1, and this is me also on TV talking about legal protection, the 5 things businesses, need to know to stay safe. Although I talk about legal protection a lot, but today's training is very exciting because I'm talking about affiliate marketing and how to make money from affiliate marketing for beginners. And, honestly, when I started my blogging online business years ago, this was one of the very first ways that I made my $100, and it was so exciting. So today, I make thousands of dollars from affiliate marketing. One of my months, recently, I had $20,000 from just affiliate marketing alone. So these are tips and tricks that, trust me, you definitely wanna pay attention to. And I can't wait for you to also start making money from affiliate marketing like a pro. Now before we get started, my one simple, humble request is for you to turn off your phone, close your tabs on the computer so that you're fully engaged.

Amira Irfan [00:01:48]:
Let's get rid of those distractions because I really want this training to be worthwhile for you, and the best way to do that is to engage with me. So don't make me feel like all alone here. Comment, ask questions so that I can address your struggles and give you solutions. And, also, let me know, like, in the comments, like, where are you in your affiliate marketing journey? Like, have you made any money? Have you signed up for any programs? Like, what are you struggling with? Alright. So what will you learn today? We have a lot to cover. 1st, we're gonna go right into what's affiliate marketing, like how you can be an affiliate and how you can even offer your own affiliate program to others. Then we're gonna talk about how to get started. Like, what are the 5 most important things that you have to remember or look for? And then what plug in that you can use to make your affiliate links look pretty? This is the plug in that I've been using for years.

Amira Irfan [00:02:43]:
Then some of the affiliate marketing rules that you absolutely need to know. These are the Federal Trade Commission disclosure requirements that you need to know legally in order to stay compliant, avoid any fines and lawsuits. I'm actually gonna give you the exact language that I usually only share in my paid disclaimer template that bloggers and entrepreneurs buy, but I'm gonna give it to you for free here because I really want you to be in compliance. And I'm also gonna tell you the 4 most important things that you need to know. Then another question that comes up often in my Facebook group is, when do I need my own affiliate program, like agreement? Right? These are also known as affiliate terms and conditions. When you sign up for an affiliate program, you will look for those terms, but there will be a time if you offer your own program. You're gonna also need to have an affiliate agreement of your own. So we're gonna address those situations.

Amira Irfan [00:03:36]:
Then top 7 affiliate program networks that you can join in your niche, and then 5 ways to make money online with your links. Now these are the special unique, you know, ideas and tips and tricks, and I'm also gonna share my experiences and examples so that you can succeed with affiliate marketing and also start making thousands of dollars. Now my legal disclaimer, because I'm a lawyer, I will be sharing some legal tips in here as well, such as affiliate disclosures and tips that you need to know. But please know that I'm not your lawyer. This training is strictly for your educational purposes. It's for informational purposes only. It's not legal advice or even business advice.

Amira Irfan [00:04:11]:
So let's get right into it. What exactly is affiliate marketing? Affiliate marketing in very simple terms is when you recommend a different product, which is not yours, like somebody else's product or service, and then you earn a commission if somebody else's product or service, and then you earn a commission if somebody else purchases through your link. So a good example is, let's say, I am recommending a business tool and then you end up clicking on my affiliate link and buying through my link that business tool, that I'm going to earn an, an affiliate commission. Another example is beauty influencers that you see on Instagram or in videos recommending makeup products. Right? Amazon products, food bloggers recommending cooking products, utensils. So these are just all different ways that you could sign up in different niches and, make money blogging. Any questions so far? Alright.

Amira Irfan [00:05:09]:
So how do you get started? When you wanna promote a product or service as an affiliate, you have to first apply to join in their affiliate program. So let's actually go through an example. So here's an example of Wordfence. Right? So let's say I want to join their program. So you just go to workfence.com, and then you scroll down. In this case, sometimes it's at the top, sometimes at the bottom. But, you know, you look at the the header footer menu, and then you go right here. I went to their affiliate program page.

Amira Irfan [00:05:40]:
And let's say I wanna sign up as an affiliate. So, obviously, I will I would wanna read all of this great stuff because I wanna know, like, how I can promote, what the product is, if it's a good fit for my audience. And let's say I'm already using Wordfence, and now I just wanna recommend it because I love it. So, again, look at their frequently asked questions, and then I go ahead and proceed with the application process. The application, usually speaking, after being part of hundreds of affiliate programs myself, it's very much the same stuff. Like, they will ask you your name, your email. You're you're gonna have to create an account, so your password, your company information, your website link. And then most likely, they wanna know, like, how are you gonna promote? So they will ask you to, like, provide that info.

Amira Irfan [00:06:24]:
Usually, a lot of affiliate programs pay by PayPal, so they would want your PayPal info here, your social media channels just to kinda get an idea if you're a good fit for them. But every application is different. Okay? So this is just like, generally speaking, that's the case, and then you sign up and then you wait. Okay? So sometimes it's a week, sometimes it's right away, sometimes it takes time. So every affiliate program, the key to remember is that they get to set their own rules. Okay? That's really important, and that's just how every company gets to do their affiliate marketing. Another question I get is, like, what do I look for when I'm signing up as an affiliate? So we touched upon some of those things, but let's go a little bit deeper. There are 5 things that you have to really pay attention to.

Amira Irfan [00:07:12]:
Okay? Number 1, what's the affiliate commission? This varies from program to pro program. Sometimes it's only 10%. Sometimes it's 50%. Sometimes it's 30%. It just depends on the actual owner of the owner of the program, whatever that percentage looks like. Then sometimes it's not even a percentage. It's just an actual amount. Like, it could be $50 per sale, $100 per sale.

Amira Irfan [00:07:32]:
I'm part of a program that that literally gives me $100 per per sign up, right, per sale. So it all varies. Sometimes it's reoccurring where you receive a percentage of the sale every month as long as the person that you refer to remains their customer. So I'll give you another example. There's a business tool that I absolutely love, Kartra. I've been using it for years, and I recommend it, and it offers me reoccurring commission monthly. So let's say you sign up for that tool through my link. Then every month for as long as you stay on with them, I'm also gonna receive a percentage of that, whatever that may be, like 10%, 20%.

Amira Irfan [00:08:13]:
It all varies. So that's what you wanna look for. What's that commission look like? The next thing you wanna pay attention to is what's the cookie period. Now what exactly is a cookie? A cookie is like the way affiliate purchases are tracked on the device that somebody clicked on. So, for example, if I am clicking right now from my computer, then there's automatically a cookie is gonna be placed onto my computer if I am going to click on your affiliate link. And that cookie period could be 30 days, 120 days, 90 days, 60 days. Again, this also varies depending on the program. I have been part of a program that actually had a whole year cookie period.

Amira Irfan [00:08:55]:
I've been part of a program that only has 30 day cookie period. Amazon is one of them, which has got the smallest cookie period, like, I think, 24 hours. So every program is very, very different. Again, you have to look for that cookie period. And another thing to keep in mind about the cookie period is that, let's say that I click on your affiliate link and the cookie period is 30 days. Within that 30 days, if I don't buy, then and I buy after the 40th 40th day, then you're not gonna gain the commission even though initially I was introduced to that product through your link. So because the cookie has expired. Or what another situation, let's say I go and I click on your link, and then there's a 30 day window.

Amira Irfan [00:09:37]:
And within those 30 days, I end up clicking on somebody else's affiliate link for the same product and ended up buying from that link, meaning whichever click was the last click, that gets recorded. It's unfortunate. You might be the first one to introduce me to that product, but then I end up clicking on somebody else's review to read more about the product and buying from that link, then that person will gain the commission, not you. How will you get paid is another very important thing to keep in mind because this also varies, depending on the program. Some people pay, 30 days after the sale. Sometimes there's a hold of 60 days. I've even had a hold of 90 days. It just you have to read the terms to know when you're gonna get paid.

Amira Irfan [00:10:21]:
In my case, there's definitely a hold of 30 days in our affiliate program, but, again, every company is different. The next thing you wanna pay attention to is the company rules, their affiliate terms and conditions to see how you can promote. Sometimes they're very special requirements. Like in Amazon's case, you are required to give in a special special language that you have to post on your site. You cannot share their links freely in your products, digital products. So you need to make sure to review those terms so that you don't violate them and get kicked out. I'll give you another example. I was part of when I was a new blogger, I was part of a program that did not want any kind of promotion on Pinterest, meaning they didn't want their affiliate links to be shared on Pinterest at all.

Amira Irfan [00:11:05]:
I could not make any pins to the affiliate product. I couldn't even share the product on Pinterest and other places, and I could only use very specific images that they had given me. I couldn't even create my own images of the product or anything like that. So keep that in mind too. Sometimes you have very specific assets that they provide you, very specific disclosure language, such as in the case of Amazon. So there will be these nuances that, again, every program is different. You're just gonna have to look for those things. That's why I'm giving you this checklist.

Amira Irfan [00:11:36]:
So that way, you can refer back to this when you're signing up and you're like, okay. These are the points that I definitely need to pay attention. The next thing to keep in mind is that quality is more important than quantity. Don't go sign up for 100 of affiliate products right away. And next thing you know, you're overwhelmed. Your audience doesn't trust you. Your business reputation is everything. Alright? So be careful promoting, recommending products that you've never used before.

Amira Irfan [00:12:03]:
The ideal and the best case scenario, and I'm giving giving you my example, is I recommend products that I've actually personally used, invested in, spent the time to learn, right, that have really made a difference in my business, those are the ones that, to be honest, result in affiliate sales because people relate to people. So when I am writing a review of, like, hey. This blogging course made me earn my first $20,000 month or $30,000 month, then that's the product that people also, whoever is looking to start a blog, is gonna wanna know. Right? Because they're in the same shoes as me. They have the same pain points. So they wanna learn about my experience with this product, and I'm putting myself on the line, and it's my reputation. So, obviously, be careful, sharing that, and people relate to those stories. Right? So if I can share my experience and help somebody, then that's kind of mentality or approach that you wanna have with affiliate products.

Amira Irfan [00:12:58]:
Think about, like, the products or services that you've used, that you love, that you can, without any reservation, recommend based on your experience. And you'll be helping someone because if you went through a struggle or pain and then that product solved that pain for you, then chances are it's gonna help somebody else in your situation as well. So that's what I do. So my favorite, honestly, products as an affiliate are the ones that I've personally invested in. I've even recommendations page on my website where you can literally see all my investments and all the different, products and tools and things that I've invested in over the years to grow my business online, and those end up becoming my best affiliate income sources. Because, again, there's a story with them. People can see my before, my after, and that is kinda how you wanna approach affiliate products as well. Another pro tip to keep in mind is that you could always offer a special bonus of your own as an added incentive for others to purchase from your link versus others.

Amira Irfan [00:14:00]:
So remember I gave you that example that I could go and click on your affiliate link, but within the cookie period, then I go and click on somebody else's review of that product, and then the second person that I clicked on will get the commission, not you. But how do we avoid that? We can easily avoid that by giving a special bonus, something extra to the to me. You could be like, hey, Amira. If you buy from my link within this time period, then you're going to get this special bonus or this special course or this special product from me or training or anything. And that might be that added incentive that I need to get it from your link versus somebody else's. So that's just another way for you to increase your affiliate commissions. And this honestly works really well. I've used this tactic all the time to make money.

Amira Irfan [00:14:49]:
Alright. So the next thing is, what plug in can we use to make affiliate links look pretty? Because if you've ever signed up for an affiliate link or product, then you will know that it's usually this long, ugly looking link like this. This is actually really my affiliate link for Wordfence, to give you an example. So that's just how it it's gonna look. Imagine sharing that on Facebook or Instagram or even on your website. It's kinda like very ugly and long and not easy to remember. So how can we make it look short and pretty? So what what I recommend is this pretty link links plugin in WordPress. Simply search for it.

Amira Irfan [00:15:25]:
It's free. And then you can easily change that link to this. So you see how now it's, like, easy to remember for me to track, and it's, like, pretty as well because it's like my website domain, and it just looks more official. And the good thing about using this plugin is that tomorrow, I've and I've had this happen a lot. People change the companies that they use for their affiliate links tracking. If they change programs, then this link will no longer work. And imagine if I had, let's say, 30 blog posts where I had shared this link, and now all of a sudden this link is not valid anymore because now there's a new program that they want me to join, then imagine going back, manually and changing that link. It's gonna be so cumbersome.

Amira Irfan [00:16:08]:
But when you use a plug in, then all you gotta do is just update the link in the plug in, and it automatically gets updated everywhere on your site. So that's really, really easy and something to keep in mind. Any questions so far? Alright. So a common question I also get is how do I write an affiliate disclosure to comply with the Federal Trade Commission rules? Because I remember I mentioned in the beginning that I'm gonna give you the exact language. So here it is. Let's start taking notes. Under the Federal Trade Commission, by the way, that's the agency that regulates privacy, that also regulates transparency with consumers. So what happens is that it is responsible for making sure that people are sharing affiliate links with transparency, and it has rules and regulations to ensure fair and ethical practices in the US and beyond.

Amira Irfan [00:17:00]:
Right? So this agency, if you don't comply with those rules, just remember that I have personally seen, influencers and bloggers getting audited. They have even gotten fined, and they've even the result they've even been sued. So you definitely wanna pay attention to those rules and do not take this lightly. And this is the language that an example that you can use. So let's say that I was writing a blog post. I would write this blog post, or let's say I was sharing an affiliate link in a course or maybe in an email. Just make sure to insert that here. This email, this blog post, or this course may contain affiliate links, which means that I will earn a small commission if you purchase through my link.

Amira Irfan [00:17:41]:
Please see full disclosure for more information. And then you have to link this full disclosure to your actual disclaimer or disclosure policy on your website. This is very important. Don't just say, a mistake I see is, like, people just say, oh, this is an affiliate link. Not everybody knows what's an affiliate link. You need to spell it out and say that I will earn a small commission if you purchase through my link. So this language is needed. And then sometimes people will stop there, and they won't even give you the full disclosure page, the link.

Amira Irfan [00:18:11]:
You need to give that as well. So keep this as keep this in mind, and I'm also gonna show you an example on my website in a bit so that you can get a better idea. So this is directly from my website. Right? And let me also show you how it looks. But this is kind of what you have to do. You have to write this post contains affiliate links, and let me show you on my website. So here's my website. Right? And here's a blog post.

Amira Irfan [00:18:35]:
I'm talking about legal pages here, but you see this is the language. This is the affiliate disclosure language right here. And then when we click here to the full disclosure, now it's gonna take you to my actual disclaimer page on my website. This is the full disclosure disclaimer policy. I call it disclaimer because my disclosure policy is already built into this template. That's just something to keep in mind that you do have to show and you have to write that, before you start sharing your affiliate link. So going back to my example here. So the key that you have to keep in mind is that you have to use clear and conspicuous language.

Amira Irfan [00:19:15]:
So do not hide the fact that it's an affiliate link. Okay? Make it extremely clear. Place the disclosure before the affiliate link, not on the sidebar. So not like, not like on the sidebar like here. This is not good enough. Make it, like, right before you actually start sharing the, the link. Okay? At the top is ideal. Then you also need to give the disclosure, even when it's in a sponsored post or even a free product that you receive.

Amira Irfan [00:19:43]:
That's a different language altogether. But because today we're talking about affiliate links, so I gave you that language. You also need to disclose on all platforms, like your website, your email, your digital products, your social media, like Facebook, Instagram, things like that. Okay? The next thing you have to keep in mind is, like, when do you need an affiliate agreement? Right? This is another question that comes up. Whenever you're gonna offer your own affiliate program to others to join to earn a commission from your own product, that's when you need an affiliate agreement. Affiliate agreement are like your rules of your affiliate program. Remember all those things we talked about, the cookie period, the compensation, how you can promote? Now you get to decide all of those things. You get to decide, like, well, how much commission you're gonna pay.

Amira Irfan [00:20:32]:
You get to decide when you're gonna pay, how you're gonna pay. All of those are your rules. So that way, you and your affiliates are on the same page. And now also remember, you have a legal obligation to ensure compliance with the Federal Trade Commission rules, and you need to put that, obligation on your affiliate. So you put all of those things in your affiliate agreement and then make sure that your affiliates are accepting those terms before they start promoting and sharing your products. Now the next question is, like, what are the top affiliate network programs that we can join to make money from home? So this is another one of those slides that you wanna screenshot or take notes on. The number 1 or the easiest one that people usually join at the very beginning is Amazon, but doesn't mean that Amazon is the most high paying or anything. Their commissions are usually very small, and over the years, they made changes.

Amira Irfan [00:21:22]:
So they're not necessarily, like, the best paying. But if you have a lot of articles ranking and, like, for example, best products or best cameras or best whatever, something like that, then Amazon products, you can easily link to them on in those website I mean, those blog posts, and then you will make those that income passively. The next one is ShareSale, then Awin, Impact, ClickBank, FlexOffers, Max Bounty, and any others in your niche. Do not be limited to just these. These are like one of those big networks that you can join. But speaking from experience, I also recommend definitely joining programs that you've invested in. Like, for example, let's say I bought a blogging course. I would always check to see if that course has an affiliate program.

Amira Irfan [00:22:10]:
If that if I love the course and I feel comfortable recommending, then I would wanna join that course that program owners, you know, the owner the course owners program. So that way I can share it with my audience and recover my investment. Just keep that in mind that there are so many others in your niche that you will find based on your, experience and how you, you know, how you invested in those programs, and that will become, like, one of the great ways for you to make money. Now the other thing is, what are the 5 ways that we can make money? Now the exciting part. Right? Number 1 and the easiest is honestly blog post. You can write a review article of the product. You can even share relevant affiliate links in your blog post naturally. Like, some examples are, like, best WordPress plug ins.

Amira Irfan [00:22:58]:
You could share, you know, a list of plug ins, and then you could be affiliate for those plug ins, and then you can easily just go down the list like a review post and share them. Another one is, like, best business blogging tools. I have a couple of blog posts about blogging tools, business tools, and they're my affiliate links. And I also talk about, like, how that tool helped me. What is that tool? What is it good for? Explain it to your audience so that they understand why they need it, if they need it. So these are just easy ways for you to, like, write those blog posts with, affiliate products. The next one is also really great, and this has worked really well for me over the years, is emails. You could send a series of emails educating your audience about your affiliate product that you're recommending, the problem that is solved, and the results that you got from it.

Amira Irfan [00:23:50]:
So this is more personal and impactful. So if it's like a hype, product, I'll give you an example. There was a blogging course that I took at the time, which was like $700, and now it's like $1,000 or something. So, obviously, it's not gonna just happen by just sharing it randomly. Right? Somebody gonna it's a it's a it's a little bit of a big ask, right, to spend $1,000. So in order for me to sell that, I have to share my story. I have to let people know in an email that how, why, first of all, I invested in this course, how it helped me, what are my results from it, do I recommend it, maybe what I liked, maybe what I didn't like so that I'm being honest and transparent. And those are the kind of emails or series of emails will result in a sale because somebody else could be in my shoes and they could be for of, you know, having the same problem and looking for a solution, and that course is going to be that solution.

Amira Irfan [00:24:40]:
So it's more personal. You can share stories and, make that recommendation. Now the next step is videos. So don't just stop with blog posts or emails. Take it a step further. I would advise to take your blog post. You've already written a nice blog post. Now turn it into a video.

Amira Irfan [00:25:01]:
Why don't you write a video review or a video tutorial of a product? You could be showing a tutorial of, like, the the tool that you're using. I have a video about Katra on my YouTube channel where I'm literally showing the inside of my dashboard. I'm showing you why I love that tool or how I've been using it for years. What are some of the ways that it's helped grow my business, scale my business? Again, you just wanna give the inside information because think about it. Like, when you go buy a product that is completely brand new, don't you look for reviews? Don't you look for testimonials? So you're doing the same thing for now your audience. Right? You're providing that testimonial. You're providing that review. And then you can share the product in your YouTube video description.

Amira Irfan [00:25:45]:
Just make sure to give that disclosure as we talked about earlier. You can also share on social media. Like, some of my students well, more like, customers, have told me that they've literally shared my legal templates affiliate link with another Facebook, friend of theirs or Instagram stories, and they've made money Without even writing a blog post, without doing any of this, again, it all comes down to where your audience is. And if you feel that you can just share on social media, like write a post or write, you know, like a helpful description or anything, you will make money through that way too. So social media is definitely a great way. The next one that you may not have thought about are your own products. Like, if you have ebooks, maybe you have a course, maybe you have a webinar, maybe you have a live training, maybe you have a PDF guide or anything. Just make sure to also share affiliate links in them.

Amira Irfan [00:26:44]:
Sometimes we are so focused on our own product that we don't even think about anybody else's product recommendations, but, you can. You know, you can definitely even offer a special discount, once again, a bonus. You can even negotiate a deal with, for your audience. Like, I've I've done this over the years, like, where I have, collaborated with another entrepreneur and I've said, hey. I would love to promote your product to my, customers. Can you give me a special discount for my audience? Maybe 20%, 10%, something like that. So then I will share that. And that also helps with affiliate sales because people are looking for that bonus.

Amira Irfan [00:27:23]:
They're looking for that discount. And that's another way that you could distinguish yourself from all the other people that are sharing that product. So keep those tips and tricks in mind. Those are great ways for you to make money from affiliate marketing. So another question I get is, can you make $100 or even $10,000 a month from affiliate marketing? Absolutely. I have made more than $20,000 a month from just affiliate marketing. It can be done. You just need to have all these strategies in place.

Amira Irfan [00:27:53]:
Execute on even 1 or 2 tips that we discussed, but do it consistently, and you will start making money. Now as a recap, here are the 5 steps to succeed with affiliate marketing. 1st, you need to research. You need to understand the products that you're gonna promote. The best ones are the ones that you've already used. Start there. Pick 1 or 2 or 5, and then join the program. Once you sign up, make sure to understand their terms and conditions, how you can promote, what's the cookie period, when you're gonna get paid, things like that.

Amira Irfan [00:28:24]:
Then you start creating content for that product. Could be a review article. It could be a video. It could be a social media post. You need to think outside the box and start doing that. Then you need to promote it. It's not enough to just share it. Like, you know, share it organically within your content.

Amira Irfan [00:28:43]:
Don't just write one blog post. Share look at your whole calendar. Look at your whole blog post planner and be like, okay. Maybe I have 5 blog posts about talking about business tools. Can I include all of these in on all 5 of them? Yes. The more you share, the more likelihood of somebody clicking on that link and buying through your link. So sometimes people make the mistake like, oh, I just wrote a blog post, but I'm not getting any sales. Well, you only shared it once.

Amira Irfan [00:29:09]:
You have to share multiple times for people to take you seriously and also for, people to be able to see that content different ways. Right? Then you analyze. Look at the analytics performance and then adjust your approach accordingly. So these are just some of the things. Now let's talk about the action steps because all of this sounds really great, but what are you gonna do next? So first thing is, like, make sure to take about, like, 5 to 10 affiliate programs in your niche. Pick them. Go through those networks that we talked about. Join 1 or 2 of them.

The next thing is that you also need to know what are disclaimers and disclosures. Like, what's the difference? People usually could get confused. And this is where I would love for you to sign up for my free legal guide. It's gonna walk you through the difference between disclosures. We talked about affiliate disclosures today, but you also need to give what are called disclaimers, and they're for a different purpose. Disclaimers are basically the language that you need to post on your site to prevent lawsuits, even lawsuits related to the affiliate programs that you're promoting.
