All right, guys. I'm so excited to have back this speaker. She was part of the very first Blogger Breakthrough Summit and so grateful that she was part of that one and that she was willing to come back to this one. She is a travel blogger and she's the founder of travel blog Prosperity. Prosperity, I can talk, a membership community for bloggers that want to grow their traffic community income. I mean, she does so much with her stuff. She's been featured in Business Insider, CNN, Jessie Festa, thank you so much for coming back.

[00:00:39.850] - Jessie
Thank you for having me.

[00:00:41.440] - Liz
Yeah, so we're going to be talking about collaborations. So, I love kind of the topic you submitted was like how to use collaborations to grow your traffic and income. So, first question I want to ask you is why collaborations over other growth methods?

[00:00:57.040] - Jessie
Yeah, so I think collaboration could be a tool to use with other growth methods. But you know, when you're starting out, it's like you don't have an audience yet, or even if you've been blogging for a while, you have your audience, but there's so many other people that could benefit from what you have to share with them. So, why not work with other people who already have that audience and get in front of them? So, for example, there is another travel blogger. We're both solo female travel bloggers. That's kind of our niche. But we also both teach about blogging, but we're not competitors with our products. Her products are really related to Tik, tok and selfpublishing, where mine are other topics like list building and affiliate marketing and things like that. So, we collaborate all the time because I know she has travel bloggers in her audience, I have travel bloggers in my audience. So, it benefits for us to kind of get in front of each other's audiences. That's just one example, but yeah, it's a great way to get in front of the people that you haven't reached yet, but that would be perfect for your community.

[00:02:03.340] - Jessie
The other thing is you could also collaborate with bloggers and brands to basically take some of the load off. For example, if you want to cocreate a product together, maybe you could have done that on your own. But there is strength in numbers and there's also strength in not having to do every single task yourself.

[00:02:25.240] - Liz
Yes. Because you know one of the goals of this summit is to help you realize kind of what you need to do and what you can just take off your plate. Whether that's by collaborating with someone or realizing it doesn't align with your business goals and just not having to do it anymore, it really varies. So, let's kind of dive in. You gave a few examples, but let's kind of dive into some specific examples of ways bloggers can collaborate. You know, maybe they don't have a product yet or something. You know what are some collaboration strategies that they could think about trying?

[00:02:57.190] - Jessie
Yeah. So, I think the basic collaboration, I know a lot of bloggers do, you don't have to be huge, you don't have to have a product to do is two different content collaborations. I mean, there's more than two, but two comes to mind, guest posting and collaborative posts. So, for guest posting, you know building backlinks is really good for search engine optimization and getting your sites seen, especially when you're a newer blogger and you really need to start building those backlinks. They're kind of like a vote of confidence from other bloggers that tell Google, okay, yeah, this is someone you can trust. So, if you could guest post, let's say your blog is about solo female travel, you might find other established high-quality solo female travel blogs and say, hey, I'd love to write a guest post on XYZ topic and you know make sure that they also allow you to have, I'd say, at least two backlinks to certain blog posts on your site and then maybe even an author bio. I know when people get posts from me, that's what I offer to contextual backlinks and a bio with your homepage and your social. So that's sort of a collaboration strategy anyone could do.

[00:04:04.710] - Jessie
And then collaborative posts, I like to create them and I also like to be a part of them. So collaborative posts are blog posts where many different people are giving inputs. So, for example, let's say, I'm writing a collaborative post on ten things to do in New York city. I'll reach out to, you know, I'll ad Tip and then maybe nine other bloggers also share a tip and the benefit for them is they get a backlink to their site. The benefit for me is I get other voices on my site, maybe tips that I didn't even know. I like to do collaborative posts, especially for maybe topics I want to cover that I don't think I could cover all on my own. Okay, so that's a strategy that could be good, whether you're creating the collaborative posts. If you're creating it, another benefit is the people that submitted tips will hopefully also share it, usually get that kind of boost in traffic. And the benefit for them is of course the back links and the visibility.

[00:05:02.740] - Liz
Yeah, and I will say as a newer blogger, if you make it super easy, it's a great way to start creating a relationship with like established bloggers. And it also just makes your site look good that even though you maybe are a newer blogger, you have Jessie or some other big blogger that's actually willing to be on your site. So, I think that, I don't do that enough but.

[00:05:31.160] - Jessie
Once a month. That's my goal.

[00:05:34.910] - Liz
There you go. I like. Okay, so we talked about kind of guestposts and stuff. I know some other ideas you mentioned before and I'd love for you to chat about them are like webinars, challenges and giveaways, because those are all very different beasts. I think a guest post and a collaborative post that's like an email, you know, you can screw it up. Don't get me wrong, I get really bad guestpost pitches all the time, but it doesn't actually take much to be a decent guest post pitch, by the way. But you know what are some of the other ways? Because those I feel like it involves a lot more work.

[00:06:11.360] - Jessie
Yes. So, I guess the next level, I would say, even if you're semi newer, is a three giveaway. So, I've done this before where the one I did was for travel bloggers. So, myself and another blogger, we decided to create, I forget what we called it, I think it was the "Free Travel Bloggers Toolbox or Toolkit". And we reached out to as many other travel bloggers we knew who gave blogging related freebies away, whether that be like lightroom presets or tips for self-publishing or ebook on how to like grow your Instagram, just all things travel bloggers would be interested in. And we put it into basically a landing page that we all promoted for one week as a free toolkit. And again, strength and numbers. We had, I think 22 people in there, all emailing our list and saying, hey, here's this free toolkit you can get that will help you like grow and monetize your travel blog. So that worked out really well, and it's something I recommend even to my newer bloggers in my membership and courses who have all had success with it. I know one of my members recently did a solo travel toolkit.

[00:07:24.660] - Jessie
I actually took part in it and it went really well, she said. So that's something you might think about. Of course, you could also do paid giveaways where you're working with say, brands. So many ways to do giveaways. I do them many different giveaways every year. But one that comes to mind, so I can give an example is my spring giveaway. It's 14 days, one price per day. And I work with brands that have affiliate programs, so they submit a prize. I don't pay the brands, they don't pay me unless they opt for some kind of additional perk, like they want to sponsor blog posts or additional promotion. But just to be included, they just have to donate the prize, it has to be at least worth $50 and they're going to ship it. But at the end, they also all offer a discount to everyone who took part in the giveaway who didn't win. And I would use my affiliate link, so that's how I monetize that without necessarily having to try to get paid sponsors. That being said, you absolutely could be paid for a giveaway. I've done that a few different ways.

[00:08:32.520] - Jessie
I've been paid a flat fee for a giveaway deliverables. I'm also going to give you the feature blows, all the social promotion, the email promotion stacked afterwards. Or another way you could do it, because I know newer bloggers sometimes like, I don't really want to reach out and be like, this is what I charge for a giveaway, you could offer to pay per result. So, something I've done with certain brands I've worked with for giveaways is I was paid $2 per email lead I got them, and the giveaway was how we got those leads. So, that can be also a good way to go about it. Just make sure that the result is something you actually think you could get. Because you know if you totally think you're only going to have ten people enter the giveaway, $20 probably not like super worth the time.

[00:09:21.790] - Liz
Yeah. Yeah.

[00:09:22.150] - Jessie
So, yeah, there's so many different ways to go about giveaways. The other thing that I really love doing in terms of collaboration is webinar swaps.

[00:09:32.040] - Liz
Okay.

[00:09:32.560] - Jessie
So, I've done this a couple of ways. I've worked with affiliate partners for this as well as other bloggers, but it's kind of the same thing because the gist is that, say, the person I'm working with, they're going to create the webinar and I am then going to promote it to my audience.

[00:09:52.920] - Jessie
And then the product pitched at the end is going to use an affiliate link for me that's going to get me referral income. And you could do it the other way too. If you have a course, you might want to work or another product, let's say a course, you could look for creators that you think would be perfect to promote it to their audience, get people into your free webinar that pitches your product and then you give them affiliate commission. Does that make sense? I feel like I went back and forth a little bit.

[00:10:22.660] - Liz
Yeah, no, it absolutely does. So, I've actually been aware of all these ideas. I've done them all at some point. But I'm never good at like consistently collaborating. I'm like, oh yeah, I want to do that more. Like I said earlier, I want to be on more podcast, you know, but I haven't actually managed it. So how do you go about making it actually happen?

[00:10:48.260] - Jessie
Yes. So, do I have my planner here, yeah. So, I schedule out my month into basically like there's basically four weeks in a month. So, four sprints. One week is content and outreach, and I'll get back to that in one sec. That's going to be important for this. One week is promo planning. One week is travel, blog, prosperity, content, getting my membership content ready for the next month because every month is a new course and you know all that kind of stuff. And then the fourth week is overflow. And maybe writing more content, maybe doing more promo planning. If it's like a huge promotion. When it comes to the promo planning, I have this like the summit's in here for January, but it's just an ugly piece of scrap paper that every month of the year, list it out and try to keep it to one big rate. I need to kind of organize it better, but it could be something like the Blogger Breakthrough Summit except in January when it's promo planning week in December, I'm going to get all the content ready. And sometimes, obviously, things have to move around depending when I, you know, when swipe copy becomes available and stuff like that.

[00:12:00.850] - Jessie
But it sets a week for me to get that done.

[00:12:04.360] - Liz
Okay.

[00:12:04.670] - Jessie
Now, I also mentioned promo, sorry, content and outreach. So, I do what I call outreach days, where at least one day a month, full day, I sit down and I think of who I might want to work with, and I reach out to them. For me, many times, this means looking for people who would be great affiliates for my courses and my membership. So, for travel blog prosperity, I might Google something like best travel blogging courses. I want to know who ranks for that term, who has these listicles that already rank for that keyword. And then I'll reach out to them and I'll say, hey, I'll give you, you know a free month to check out my membership. And then if you like it and want to add it to your guide, I can create an affiliate link with increased commission for you. And I also do that. I run New York city photo tours and photo shoots. I do that for that too. That's a big one. Another goal I have with my membership, I don't know everything. I love having guest teachers come on.

[00:13:08.460] - Jessie
So, I will do outreach for that. Hey, if you teach a course or workshop in my membership, I'd love to create something for you in return. So, think about if you want to do this too.

[00:13:20.680] - Liz
Sure.

[00:13:21.220] - Jessie
Your unique goals for your blog, what you want to accomplish, and who would be the perfect partner to help get that done. Maybe that means, you know, reaching out to, like I said before, people that would be perfect to promote a webinar you've created that pitches your product, and you really want to get it out to as many people as possible. Really look for those creators who have that audience that would be perfect. You can see they have great engagement with their audience and things like that.

[00:13:50.590] - Liz
Yes. Okay. So, I love that idea of having, like, a one day dedicated to that. But how do you keep it organized, right? Because once you do an outreach, then there's back and forth, and then there's like, well, I never actually heard back from that person, do I follow up? Like how do you keep that organized and keep track of it all?

[00:14:09.010] - Jessie
Yeah, I honestly just use a Google spreadsheet. I have different tabs for different projects. So, like affiliate outreach, like looking for people to be in my course affiliates, that would be a tab. My NYC photo stores affiliates outreach, that would be a tab. Travel blog prosperity, guest teachers, that would be a tab. So, yeah. And then I'll put, like, the name, the contact info, the date I reached out, and then if they respond yes or no, I'll put that. And then I'll also have a section that's not really on the bottom, but I just have a list of people that okay, next time I do an outreach day, this is who I want to reach out to. Maybe it's someone I just kind of discovered on another day during the month. I see them post something or they email me and I'm like, okay, wait, note to self. When I do when I sit down to do all the outreach, I'm going to reach back out to them and I'll just put them on that little list.

[00:15:05.580] - Liz
Awesome. No, I like that. I seriously just need to get better about it. Obviously, the summit is a collaboration tool. I collaborate with a lot of people on the summit, but it's only once a year. And that's another example of a way to collaborate. If you want to do a summit.

[00:15:24.410] - Jessie
That's like the perfect idea. You could try to teach. There's so many awesome courses in this and workshops, but like, A, obviously that would be hard to have all that knowledge in one person, but B, even the thought of recording would be plus workshops, that would be wild. Like, A, the workload is less with more people, but B, now you have all these awesome speakers also promoting it and that strength in numbers can be so powerful as you know that you've been doing this.

[00:15:56.660] - Liz
Yeah. Okay. So, I think you know, we've touched on kind of a great approach to collaboration, but I always think it's important to know kind of potential pitfalls and mistakes people make regarding this. Could you share some examples?

[00:16:11.210] - Jessie
Yeah. So, I would say, one thing that comes to mind is if you're collaborating on say, an event like a summit or a product, you really, like if you're cooking, you're cocreating something, you want to be so clear on who is doing what. 'Cause I've definitely run into it where I end up feeling like I'm doing everything and we're still both kind of reaping the same benefits because we've like cocreated it together or yeah, just any.

[00:16:43.830] - Liz
[inaudible 00:16:44] as an adult.

[00:16:44.300] - Jessie
Yeah. And you just want to really make sure, like really think about the amount of time and effort it will take you to do each task and really divvy it up, so that each person is, A, doing the tasks that kind of speak to their interests and strengths, but B, you feel like it's equal. You don't feel like you're doing all of the work. And I think just clarity and any kind of collaboration, that's going to be the key. I'm even thinking of my New York city photo tours when I created my liability waiver and also the terms and conditions. It's like I updated all the time when new issues arise, like what is every single thing that could go wrong? Like what do we need to kind of address in the beginning, so everyone's on the same page?

[00:17:29.060] - Liz
Yes. And I will say when you are collaborating, the legal aspect, having a contract in place is huge. Like I know it doesn't sound, it makes it more efficient, right? But it's to protect both of you, so please don't skip that part. We're not going to dive too far into that. We have legal sessions, but I just, yeah.

[00:17:49.090] - Jessie
Yeah, and I honestly appreciate it too. Like, when I speak at a summit or I contribute something to a bundle, I like having a contract because I want to know what's expected of me and exactly what to expect, when's the payout date, how many emails should I send, all that stuff. It's good for both parties, to be clear on that.

[00:18:10.050] - Liz
Yeah, and I think with a contract, people pay more attention to those things in it as opposed to an email buried somewhere. It's like, well, you were supposed to do this. And you're like, you know, you're like, wait, let me go find that email. I don't know what you're asking me. Okay. So, potential mistakes, obviously, not having some legal place. Any other mistakes? Because I think we both mentioned how we both get really bad pitches. Like, what makes a pitch good versus bad in your experience?

[00:18:45.040] - Jessie
One thing I don't like, and honestly, I usually just leave the email, is people will be like, oh, I'd love to guest post for you. I heard you're looking for, like I just posted today in a group, I'm looking for solo female travel guides for different cities, cities I haven't been to, but I want to grow. That's my main category. People will just email me like, hey, I travel solo, I'd love to write for you. Like that's not a pitch. What's your idea?

[00:19:16.410] - Liz
Yeah.

[00:19:17.320] - Jessie
I'm not going to go look at your site and figure out where you've been. Like send me an idea, even if it's just a few sentences, like, what would you cover and why are you the person to cover this can be so helpful. And I'll say on my end, I am very particular with the guest posts that I get. So, before they even write it, I let them know I'm expecting over 2000 words. I'm going to give them the sections and the keywords and the outline. Like I do all that research beforehand because if I'm going to take the time to edit the guest post and if you're going to take the time to write it, like, we both should want it to rank, that could help the guest poster get traffic too.

[00:20:01.140] - Jessie
So, I'm also on my end, very clear ahead of time that it's not just going to be like, five things to do in New York City with a 500 word little thing that's not going to benefit anyone, really.

[00:20:13.990] - Liz
Yeah. I have, like, guest post guidelines on my site, and if I get a pitch that doesn't follow those, I just ignore it. Yeah, like, do your homework. It's not, just read those things, follow the guidelines, and chances of being accepted are pretty dang high. It's not that hard.

[00:20:35.440] - Jessie
Hundred percent. I don't fully follow people when they do the next thing, but it's a good idea if you're pitching an idea to check if it's been covered yet or maybe if like, it has and you see, oh, wait, this hasn't been updated in five years. Say, hey, I saw you had this topic. It hasn't been updated. I'd love to add these additional tips to it, something like that, at least. Yeah, do that little bit of homework. It's really not hard. Google is your friend.

[00:20:59.960] - Liz
Yeah, I get so annoyed when I get guest pictures of like, we love this post to be on your site. And I'm like, I literally have a post just like that already. Did you even look?

[00:21:07.450] - Jessie
Like it's on my home page, it's the last thing I wrote.

[00:21:11.810] - Liz
All right. Also, make sure you send the correct guest post. I had someone who was going to guest post and then they sent me an article on nights for my personal finance site, and I was like.

[00:21:23.510] - Jessie
It doesn't seem like you're paying attention. 

[00:21:26.740] - Liz
Yeah. No, like, oh, sorry, that was for a different one. And I was like, yeah, I'm going to pass on whatever you came up with because I don't have time.

[00:21:32.960] - Jessie
Actually, one other thing, no matter what collaboration you pitch, make the email personal and address people by name. I get so many emails. I mean, obviously, the spammy ones that are like, dear Webmaster, which I just [inaudible 00:21:47], but some people don't greet at all, and it kind of just makes me feel like it's a mass email, almost.

[00:21:52.390] - Liz
Yeah.

[00:21:53.510] - Jessie
So, yeah, if you can make it personal, like genuinely personal, not just like it sounds personal, but it's a mass email like that's going to go a long way. I know I did PR for a company, like, years ago. It was a small startup, and I remember we did like a welcome event or like a launch event, and so many people were like, I never come to these, but your email was so personal. I spent so long writing each email to each blogger, like, going on for like, oh, I think you would love this because of XYZ, like, looking at their site, it really can make a difference.

[00:22:27.460] - Liz
Yeah. And you can use, so like I use, especially for the summit when I'm pitching and stuff, because I do, I pitch a lot of people, I pitch a lot, you know. Obviously, there's a part of the email that's going to be the same, and having messed up copy and paste before, I do use a tool that's like a mass email thing, but I always include a section of their, like, personal section. Right? And so in my spreadsheet that goes through the tool, I have the personal greeting like, hey, I'm so glad you did this. Last I heard, you're doing this, whatever, I know you just wrapped up a launch. Like, you can make those personalized without it being really hard.

[00:23:08.440] - Jessie
Yeah. Because obviously, if you're pitching, like, you know when I'm asking people to be a guest teacher on travel blog prosperity, I copy and paste the description of the membership, what would be needed, what I would like offer in return, like that's all copy and pasted. There's no need for me to retype that for 30 minutes every time.

[00:23:25.030] - Liz
Yeah. Yeah.

[00:23:25.330] - Jessie
But of course, you have those initial lines where I'm saying I think you'd be great to teach about this. I love your work, doing X-Y-Z. Like, I look at what they're doing and what they're an expert in, what their books and courses and products are and things like that.

[00:23:39.710] - Liz
Yes. Yeah, so, no, I fully agree with that, make it personal. Okay. Any idea you kinda wanna, we covered a lot, and I don't want to overwhelm, any kind of final tips of advice for using collaborations to grow?

[00:23:54.040] - Jessie
I would say I can't remember if I mention this, but just, I know one question I get in my audience a lot is how do I even begin to know what to collaborate on? Think about your own goals in your blog. What works for someone as a collaboration might not work for another person. For example, we talked about like cocreating products and summits and things like that. Your imagination is the limit with this. So, really think about what you want to achieve with your blogging business, what kind of projects, and tasks, and things, events could help you reach those goals, and who would be the perfect fit to help make it happen more easily for you. So that's where I would kind of start and then go from there.

[00:24:41.620] - Liz
Okay. And I know you have a freebie for our attendees. Can you tell us a little bit about it?

[00:24:47.610] - Jessie
Yeah, so it is a free workshop sharing ten different ways to make money blogging. Along with sharing the ways, I also give tips on how to implement as well as examples of what these sort of revenue streams look like in real life. So, definitely check it out. If you want to monetize a blog, I highly, highly recommend it. And then it's prerecorded. But on the classroom page, there is a question box where if a question comes up during the workshop, you can just type right in there. And I'll get it and I'll respond right away.

[00:25:21.790] - Liz
That's awesome. And then I think also you've been kind enough to contribute something for those that get the all access pass. If you've been on the fence about the all access pass, do you want to tell them you know what they could get from you and they all inside that pass?

[00:25:35.530] - Jessie
Yes. So I have included a course on how to update your old content to help grow your traffic. One thing I've noticed a lot is you know we're always thinking about what do I write next, what do I write next, creating a new post. And then we kind of neglect the content we've already created when actually, A, it'll be quicker for you to update it. And B, there is data in your Google search console that can tell you steps to take to update it. And, yeah, that could give you a nice boost in traffic. So, it's going to go over that step by step for you.

[00:26:06.690] - Liz
All right. So, if you guys want that, go grab the all access pass. Jessie, thank you so much for coming back. It's been so great to see you again.

[00:26:13.990] - Jessie
You, too, and thank you so much for having me.
