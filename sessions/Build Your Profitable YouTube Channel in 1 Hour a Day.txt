Hey there, it's a Meredith Marsh here, and welcome to the presentation for how to build your profitable YouTube channel in one hour a day. I'm going to officially introduce myself in just a moment, but I want to quickly thank Liz for having me here this year for the Blogger Breakthrough Summit. I am so excited about 2021. And we're going to dive into one of my favorite topics, YouTube. I've got some slides for you so you don't have to watch me talk with my hands this whole time.

[00:00:39.740] - Meredith
All right. So let's dive into this now. I'm going to make a big giant assumption and assume that you're here because you would like to increase your audience and come online using YouTube. That's what we're all here for, right? Well, in this session, I'm going to teach you a simple way to incorporate YouTube into your existing strategy in one hour a day so that you can impact more people while making more money online, even if you're, “just anything”.

[00:01:14.630] - Meredith
You're just a mom. You're just a blogger, just a coach, just an attorney, just a shy introvert who prefers to be behind the camera. Or if you're a side hustler, a full time online entrepreneur or full time blogger, or if you manage your household full time or even if you have a full time job and you just can't walk away from your day to day life to start a YouTube channel, this is your chance to take those first steps towards starting and growing a YouTube channel that can lead to long term profit without it taking over your life completely.

[00:01:48.590] - Meredith
Like I already mentioned, my name is Meredith Marsh. I am the creator of the Meredith Marsh YouTube channel. It used to be called the vidpromom uYouTube channel.

[00:01:58.610] - Meredith
I'm also the founder of the Video Pursuit Society and I blog over at Vidpro Mom.Com. And my passion is helping side hustler's thrive as video content creators. I love giving the what I call the beyond the job training that you need to grow your audience and then come online using YouTube so that you can create more options and opportunities for yourself outside of a traditional job. And I'm sure it's no surprise to you that time is the biggest struggle that my clients and students have when it comes to getting their YouTube channel off the ground.

[00:02:38.720] - Meredith
But there's two things that I teach them right away about time.

[00:02:43.710] - Meredith
The first is that time is actually the number one reason why YouTube is the perfect side hustle or addition to an existing blog or online business. The content you create on YouTube has longevity, thanks to the fact that it’s search engine and when your videos are getting views for months and even years down the road, you also earn passive income and you probably already know what passive income is.

[00:03:11.540] - Meredith
But in a really quick nutshell, when it comes to online business and content creation, passive income could be something where you're earning revenue in the form of something like ad revenue through YouTube or through your blog ad network or you're making affiliate sales. These are things where you don't need to be present to get paid. Now, as you can imagine, there's more to it than simply just publishing videos that you're interested in creating or videos that you think will do well on YouTube.

[00:03:42.140] - Meredith
In fact, if time is your biggest YouTube struggle right now, then this is more important than ever.

[00:03:49.700] - Meredith
If you have a YouTube channel already, right, and you've been publishing videos and not seeing much growth, like you're not getting views or subscribers or, you know, maybe you're getting some, but it's just not as much as what you were hoping for. It's not your fault.

[00:04:05.570] - Meredith
You probably haven't been applying a strategy and knowing the exact right steps to take in the right direction. So the second thing that I teach my new clients and students is the search and rescue method, which is the fastest way to grow your YouTube channel. There's a ton of conflicting information out there. I recently had someone reach out to me and say that YouTube is like a a swamp of information. There's so much of it.

[00:04:36.320] - Meredith
And you never know really what you're getting into. And it's hard to know what the right steps are.

[00:04:43.640] - Meredith
So during the session, we're going to dip our toes into the search and rescue method. And together we'll create the foundation for building your profitable YouTube channel. Plus, you'll also have a plan for how to pull it all together by spending just an hour a day on it, because who has time to let you, to take over your life right now? Right.

[00:05:02.120] - Meredith
So in this session, we're going to follow along with this workbook. You might have access to this already, if not, you can download it at Vidpromom.com/YouTubeworkbook, you don't have to give me your email address or anything. It's just a direct download of the PDF.

[00:05:20.610] - Meredith
Now, most people are hesitant to start a YouTube channel or they're confused about how to get their channel off the ground because there's so much information out there, a lot of it contradicts each other. It almost kind of feels like if you follow the advice of one guru, then you're going against the advice of another. Right. It's like totally confusing.

[00:05:41.490] - Meredith
And combine the confusion with finding time to sit down and figure out what videos to create, how to do the Keyword research for YouTube and is it different than blogging and then fiddle with the camera and the lights and the microphone to shoot something and then finally actually be able to edit your videos. I want you to know that I hear you. It is a lot and I am you. I am a full time content creator myself. I'm a mom. I have all the same household management life stuff that most of us have.

[00:06:20.520] - Meredith
The only difference between those of us who gain momentum on YouTube and those of us who stay stuck is that momentum requires us to take action no matter how small that action is. So I don't want to take up too much time here.

[00:06:37.620] - Meredith
I want to dive into the actual strategy stuff. But I love to tell the story about how I joined the track team when I was in eighth grade because my boyfriend at the time was on the track team. I didn't know how to run. I did not enjoy running at all. I certainly could not jump over a hurdle. I didn't know what a relay was, but I joined the track team and when the coach asked for a female to volunteer to be the triple jumper on the track team, nobody raised their hand.

[00:07:11.460] - Meredith
Which if you have ever seen someone do a triple jump or if you've done it yourself, you'll know why it's weird, it's awkward.

[00:07:20.520] - Meredith
You look really silly while you're doing it, because it's basically a combination of tripping over your own feet and then landing in a sand pit. Of course, I didn't know any of that. So for some reason I can't explain. I raised my hand to volunteer and as the lone female triple jumper on the team for that season, I only had to compete one time. In that event, none of the teams that we competed against had a female triple jumper to compete except for one.

[00:07:52.380] - Meredith
I had essentially chosen a sport that no one else dared to do because it was awkward. So what does it have to do with YouTube? I promise it does. According to a Pew Research study, the fact is 73 percent of adults in the United States use YouTube. That's more than Facebook. It's almost twice as much as Instagram. And according to YouTube, 70 percent of what people watch is determined by the recommendation algorithm, which is why the search and rescue method is the fastest way to grow your YouTube channel, because when you show up as a search result or a recommended channel again and again for your ideal viewers, you become what I like to call is the hero in your niche.

[00:08:39.840] - Meredith
You become that go to person on the biggest social media platform on the planet.

[00:08:46.050] - Meredith
So in your workbook at the very top on page two, just quickly jot down what exactly is your niche? What type of content are you creating?

[00:08:57.960] - Meredith
What's your broad niche? Just write that down at the top. And I if we were in an in-person conference, I would say look around at the other bloggers and content creators that are in your exact niche.

[00:09:08.280] - Meredith
But in this case, I know you know who they are, right? You, you follow them on Instagram, you probably follow them on Facebook. You see them in all the Facebook groups that you're also in. So just think about some of your fellow bloggers and influencers that are also in your niche.

[00:09:28.140] - Meredith
You probably know who's fish taco recipe is outranking you on Google, right, or who beat you to the 10000 Instagram followers milestones and now they get the swiper feature.

[00:09:38.910] - Meredith
And if you're in a popular niche like food or travel or lifestyle or health and fitness, you probably know tens or even hundreds of other people who are content creators within the same niche.

[00:09:51.600] - Meredith
Right. But how many of them are all in, on YouTube?

[00:09:57.930] - Meredith
So through my short career as a triple jumper, I learned that there are two ways to win in this world. The first way is to do the easy thing, the thing that everyone wants to do, the thing that anyone can do easily. And when it comes to online business, blogging, content creation, this means posting on Instagram, scheduling pins on Pinterest and just creating more and more of the same types of content. This stuff is relatively easy.

[00:10:27.390] - Meredith
As a content creator, you can do it and so can everyone else.

[00:10:33.390] - Meredith
The barrier to entry is pretty low.

[00:10:36.720] - Meredith
The second way is to do the thing that other people are kind of afraid to do because they might fail or they might look silly, or it might seem awkward at first and for online business, for blogging, for site hustler's content creators when it comes to doing YouTube, that's usually the thing that people don't want to do, right?

[00:10:57.810] - Meredith
It usually translates to you, well, I can't do YouTube because I say too much or I don't look good on camera. I'm too old for YouTube. I'm too fat for YouTube.

[00:11:07.320] - Meredith
Oh, I can't do that because I'm an introvert or I need to get my blog set up. I need to get my Instagram set up. I need to get my Pinterest set up. I need my brand photos done. I need to get my business cards printed before I'll be ready for YouTube.

[00:11:21.270] - Meredith
It's the thing that most content creators put off and very few dare to do. So YouTube is for people who want to be the type of person who dares to show up, even if you're an introvert like me, even if you have lots of other things going on in your life, like a family, your own business, your blog, or even a full time job like I did.

[00:11:48.450] - Meredith
But you might be wondering, isn’t YouTube huge? Like isn't there a massive amount of competition there? Am I too late to the party? Isn't there too much noise? How do I even stand out at this point?

[00:11:59.550] - Meredith
And the answer is yes. There is a lot of people on YouTube. There are a lot of YouTube channels. There's 31 million YouTube channels out there.

[00:12:09.120] - Meredith
But of those, only six million have 1000 subscribers or more. So what does that mean?

[00:12:17.290] - Meredith
That means that over 80 percent of the channels on YouTube are stuck as very small or new channels.

[00:12:23.760] - Meredith
Maybe the creator just started a channel for fun and they threw a few videos up.

[00:12:29.820] - Meredith
Maybe they started a channel and they didn't see success right away, so they gave up. Either way, they're not implementing the search and rescue method. So to use that track meet analogy, 80 percent of the channels on YouTube are created by people who dare to show up once or twice, but they're not prepared to compete. So let's dive back into the workbook here. What are your let's say like what are your top performing blog posts?

[00:12:55.080] - Meredith
What are your favorite topics that you like to talk about?

[00:12:58.590] - Meredith
What will you be covering on your YouTube channel? What is your audience asking you for? This can go in that second section under top topics on page two. This is essentially like the topics that you're going to build the foundation of your YouTube channel on. All you had to really do is jot down some ideas. So if you have a blog with content on it already, this would be a great place to write down some of your top topics. If you look into your analytics, if you don't have a blog or you're just getting started, then just think about what are your favorite topics to talk about or write about within your niche.

[00:13:37.470] - Meredith
What do you think would make a great foundation to build your channel on? And that's where you can jot down some ideas there.

[00:13:46.290] - Meredith
So for me, I started with GoPro tutorials back in 2015. I started a blog which turned into a YouTube channel all about teaching people how to use a GoPro camera, how to edit GoPro videos, how to create family videos with a GoPro camera, which accessories to buy that kind of thing. And I started my YouTube channel and my blog while I had a full time job. My kids were seven and three. I have two little girls. They're not as little anymore, I should say.

[00:14:18.450] - Meredith
One of them is taller than me. So I wish this was like the entrepreneurial love story that most people tell where they start a blog or a YouTube channel. They start to make money. They put in their two week notice and they quit their job. The truth is, I lost my job, but I had started with my Vidpromom as a side hustle, taking small but consistent baby steps. I started making a little bit of money. I launched a course.

[00:14:44.640] - Meredith
I was earning some passive income, and then my employer moved to another city and eliminated my position. It was really before I was ready to dive into full time online entrepreneurship, I, I kind of jumped. It was kind of like pushed a little bit, but I kind of jumped before I was ready. But I had the foundation of taking consistent action, the right steps in the right direction to build upon.

[00:15:13.110] - Meredith
And those are the exact steps that you're going to be able to take action on during this session. So let's dive in the next section here on page two is who are you? Who are you helping? What are you helping them do? Why do you need that? Why do they need that? Excuse me? And why are you the best person to help them? These may or may not be new questions for you, depending on where you're at in your blogging journey, but these are important steps to take and building your profitable YouTube channel.

[00:15:48.720] - Meredith
So then on page three, you're going to jot down some video topic ideas. So I like to have people start with ten ideas off the top of your head. I know you have a list of ideas in your head. I know you have been thinking like, oh, that might make a good YouTube video or could I make a YouTube video about that? How would that work? So ten ideas just off the top of your head. You probably have way more than that.

[00:16:15.090] - Meredith
Then you can write down, but just jot down ten to start with and then ten ideas that are super basic, like, you know, I don't know, sewing for beginners or something, you know, for beginners or how to get started with.

[00:16:29.960] - Meredith
X, Y and Z, what does your ideal viewer need in order to get started with the thing that you teach, with your topic, with your niche and then 10 topics around daily use products or software within your niche?

[00:16:50.510] - Meredith
I'm going to use an example, a couple of slides from now on, like crafting, sewing and things like that. So this is where you might write down, like the sewing machine that you use, the accessories, the brand of scissors that you use or where you shop for your fabric or what cutting machine you use, like that kind of thing.

[00:17:14.240] - Meredith
Like what are the actual products or software that you use within your niche that other people, that your audience would also be using or have questions about?

[00:17:26.010] - Meredith
So you've got a little brainstorm there of some some video topic ideas and what you've created so far with this workbook is not only the start of a great foundation for your YouTube channel, but also the makings of the perfect about page for your YouTube channel. And you might be thinking, oh, we have an about page on YouTube? A lot of people don't even know that it's there.

[00:17:50.550] - Meredith
If you set up a YouTube channel, like when you set up your blog and I know a lot of us do this where like we set up the blog, we get the domain name, we find the Instagram handle, the Twitter handle, the Pinterest account, the YouTube, the Facebook. So you may have a YouTube channel without any content on it, but you also have an about page.

[00:18:11.490] - Meredith
and if that is blank, you can use what you've created so far in this workbook to complete your about page really easily. And so here's why it's important to focus on this at this stage. So YouTube and humans, they need to know what your channel is about.

[00:18:30.300] - Meredith
Who are you? Where can I learn more about you? Are you like a real person or I mean, we’re all real people.

[00:18:38.400] - Meredith
But are you legit? Right. People want to know that. And perhaps most importantly, people want to know what is your channel about? The YouTube algorithm wants to know what your channel is about. Google wants to know what your channel is about.

[00:18:52.320] - Meredith
Why should people care?

[00:18:54.180] - Meredith
So the exercise is on pages two, three and four here are crucial for setting up your channel for success, not because you're about page per say, like your page is not going to make or break your YouTube channel, but because you've taken the time to figure these things out before you start creating content for YouTube. So page four is essentially a template that you can use to using what you have on pages two and three. You can kind of fill in the blanks here and create your YouTube about page.

[00:19:31.110] - Meredith
So with your rocking about page, you can create your channel art to visually represent your channel, what your channel is about, who it's for, why they should care. Page five of your workbook has a link to download my channel art template so that you can, can do your homework.

[00:19:31.110] - Meredith
After this session. You can finish setting up your channel, you can create your YouTube banner. It's a little bit tricky because of the sizing and that's why I created the template. So you can make sure that your channel Art doesn't get completely cut off, you know, in different devices. So you can grab that template there from the link in page five. But let's dive back into the strategy stuff.

[00:20:13.710] - Meredith
So YouTube desperately wants to match viewers with your video. So usually we kind of have this backwards in our minds. We usually think that YouTube is looking for viewers for our videos.

[00:20:29.220] - Meredith
Like if I publish a video, YouTube is going to go out and it's going to find my subscribers and it's going to find, I don't know, other random people. And it's going to put my video in front of those people. But it's actually the other way around. YouTube is actually looking for videos to match to its viewers.

[00:20:49.080] - Meredith
So when Sally logs into YouTube and she's on the YouTube homepage or she opens up the YouTube app, YouTube is going to gather up the videos that it thinks she's most likely to be interested in and show them to her at the top of the page, at the top of her homepage.

[00:21:10.770] - Meredith
So for every user on their platform, the algorithm is trying to predict exactly what that viewer is going to want to watch next. What are they actually going to hit play and watch next to to stay on the platform to watch more and more videos? Because the longer the viewers are on YouTube watching the content, the more money YouTube makes. And YouTube is obviously a business, a very big business. So YouTube wants people to watch your channel as much as you do.

[00:21:42.660] - Meredith
And using the search and rescue method, we can do some of the heavy lifting for YouTube and make it easier for YouTube to pair its viewers with videos, with your videos.

[00:21:56.400] - Meredith
So to help YouTube know who you are and what you're all about, we really need to fill out our niche on YouTube like a spider web. When you niche out your content, the spider web effect starts to take hold and the content you create begins to attract your ideal viewers. But the biggest benefit of the spider web effect is that you'll know which topics are worth your time to create. No more guessing. So remember these ideas from page three, right?

[00:22:30.700] - Meredith
Yeah, page three, we need to put these ideas into the spider web and this is where the examples come in here.

[00:22:36.420] - Meredith
So these are some example topics for someone who might be thinking about starting a channel about, let's say, like all things crafting. OK, so we have sewing, our cricket tutorials, buying guides. We have topics over there on the left hand side like how to sew scrunchies, how to sew curtains, watercolor for beginners, best cricket must have cricket accessories, things like that. So this is where the spider web effect comes into action. So let's pretend that this circle here on the right hand side is a spider web.

[00:23:15.870] - Meredith
So if you imagine that you took like three to four categories from your list of ideas, if we go back here, we have ,sewing our cricket tutorials, and buying guides. We kind of separated our ideas into some categories, into some like buckets, if you will.

[00:23:32.610] - Meredith
And this is where the spider web effect starts to work. So we took our categories. We have three or four. Three or four is usually a good place to start.

[00:23:44.040] - Meredith
You know, preferably three is is usually enough for your brain to handle.

[00:23:49.410] - Meredith
And we're going to say this niche is crafts or crafting. So we have crafts right there in the middle of our spider web.

[00:23:58.450] - Meredith
So crafting is at the spider of the web, the spider of the web, crafting is at the center of the web, and you want to cover all of these topics on your channel, right. So let's say this week you create a video about how to sew scrunchies.

[00:24:15.220] - Meredith
And next week is a video about how to create vinyl stickers with your cricket machine. And the week after that is about how to create stained glass window art or something. Right. These are all crafts.

[00:24:27.530] - Meredith
But they're also all over the place, and the problem with that is that if a viewer or one hundred or thousands of viewers find your scrunchie video through the search results, let's say, and it's really helpful and it's exactly what they want and they watch the whole thing and then click your links and they make purchases through your affiliate links. Right. What are the chances that those people, those viewers also want to do cricket stickers and stained glass window art?

[00:25:02.480] - Meredith
Who knows?

[00:25:03.170] - Meredith
Right. For all we know, none of them are interested in those topics.

[00:25:07.400] - Meredith
And you might be thinking, so what's the big deal? So the scrunchy people don't want to watch a cricket tutorial. They just don't watch it. The problem with that is two things.

[00:25:17.360] - Meredith
One, if they do click on your vinyl sticker tutorial and then they're like, why?

[00:25:23.870] - Meredith
This isn't what I wanted to see. I thought this was the scrunchie lady, they click off. And what does that tell You Tube? Your video is no good. No one wants to watch it. Your YouTube, YouTube, YouTube has zero incentive to show that vinyl sticker tutorial to more people within the algorithm. So it hurts your channel overall. But the second thing is that and this is more important by not making another scrunchy video or at least a hair accessory, sewing related video, then you're missing a huge opportunity to serve up content that these people who've you've already attracted want to watch.

[00:26:11.610] - Meredith
So this is how the spider web effect affects your channel, if you think of a spider, it weaves a spider web to catch her food and then when insects or bugs fly by, essentially get caught in the web and that's how she eats.

[00:26:26.370] - Meredith
So you want to kind of think of your YouTube channel and set it up to do the very same thing.

[00:26:31.650] - Meredith
So if you pretend the dots here, the the circular web on your screen, if you think of the dots are actual videos and they are all within one section of your spider web, when a potential viewer is searching for topics or even just browsing YouTube, you want them to find your videos. So you need to have a web of videos that's like so tight that your ideal viewer can't even browse YouTube without seeing your videos being recommended to them.

[00:27:06.490] - Meredith
So when your topics are scattered, there's not enough of a web there to catch people, it's just like a one off video about scrunches. People have no reason to stay. They have no reason to watch more of your videos because they came for the scrunches and you don't have any more videos about scrunches.

[00:27:25.030] - Meredith
So remember, YouTube wants to keep people watching YouTube videos. So we need to create videos that keep people on your channel, basically binge watching your videos or at the very least hitting the subscribe button so they can come back later and learn more from you. This is how you gain traction on YouTube quickly and build a profitable YouTube channel so that you can monetize your channel with ads and attract viewers who want to. I like to think of them as kind of like stay in your wake.

[00:27:55.810] - Meredith
They want to see what you're up to. They want to watch your videos. They subscribe to your emails. They join your Facebook group. They buy from your affiliate links. They join your online programs, they hire you for coaching, etc.. Now, one quick word about monetizing your channel with ads. In order to earn ad revenue through YouTube, you have to have 1000 YouTube subscribers and 4000 hours of watch time. It's completely doable, you know, within a year or less if you follow a strategy and publish consistently.

[00:28:30.940] - Meredith
So how do you make this work for you in just an hour a day so that YouTube doesn't have to take over your whole entire life?

[00:28:38.260] - Meredith
So there's two two main processes for this. And these are just ideas. They, they should work. One of these should work for most people. But you can adapt these to your own lifestyle. So the first way is to plan and publish week by week. So if your video topics in your video style and your skills are such that the videos that you create are pretty easy to set up and record and edit, then you could spend an hour a day doing each phase.

[00:29:11.140] - Meredith
So let's say if you create tutorials where you're recording your screen or if you are doing like a like a craft tutorial where you're recording, you know, your hands and you can just kind of shoot an intro and outro with your face on camera or not even have your face on camera at all. Then on Sunday, you can plan your topic, do your keyword research, do your optimization, figure out what you're actually going to cover in the video.

[00:29:38.590] - Meredith
Like what am I actually going to say Monday? You can record when you use a block scripting process. It's super quick and easy. Tuesday you edit and when your videos are planned and scripted, editing is so much faster than winging it. And I hear all the time people are like, oh my gosh, it took me six hours to edit my video. My question is always, did you plan the video before you record it? Because a lot of times the answer is no.

[00:30:06.370] - Meredith
Let me just tell you, it is so much faster to edit a video when you have planned it out before you shot the video, because then it's just a matter of putting it all together. It's like building a scrapbook or something. Right. So by Wednesday, you can finalize your edit, make any polishing touches you can upload it to YouTube and get it ready to be published and turn it into a blog post or repurpose it, for example. You can, like, do all those kind of things and get it ready to go live and then say on Thursday you can hit publish.

[00:30:41.790] - Meredith
So, oops, let me go back.

So if your videos take a little more time to create, if you have a lot of moving parts, if it's more of a process for you, like if you make cooking type of videos where you have actual ingredients in food that you have to prep in order to be ready to create your videos, then I would highly recommend that you plan on taking a whole day or even just an afternoon to shoot several videos at one time. You could do this maybe once a month.

[00:31:13.290] - Meredith
And so you can spend an hour a day up to that point, doing the planning. So doing your keyword research and optimization, scripting your videos, prepping to shoot the video and then spending a day or an afternoon actually doing the shoot. And then you can edit as you go or you can hire an editor to do that part of the process. This the process of creating videos is so personal. It's it's a little bit of art, it's a little bit of science.

[00:31:45.030] - Meredith
So it's a personal kind of creation, creative process for people. And as long as you're taking the right steps in the right direction, right. You're always moving forward. Nothing has to be perfect when you're just starting out and you have to remember that it's a creative process and it's OK to experiment and just try new things. So we dipped our toes into the search and rescue method to build your library oYouTube videos that get views and gain subscribers for weeks, months and years to come.

Your next steps are from here to update your about page and your channel art based on the template inside of the workbook. Come up with five to 10 video topic ideas in one section of your spider web, just one section of your spider web and then the next steps from there would be to plan and create those videos.

So, you know, with millions of views happening every hour on YouTube, the second largest search engine on the planet, nearly all of them come from search results and the recommendation algorithm.
