Hey there, and welcome to 4 Website Mistakes That are Costing you Readers and Revenue. The reality is that you have less than 10 seconds to convince a visitor to your website that they are in the right place, and you could be losing readers and revenue without even realizing it. My name is Kristen Doyle, and I'm a web designer and a business coach who helps business owners like you build websites that attract and engage readers ultimately boosting your blog's revenue potential. I'm also the host of the Savvy Seller podcast, and I am passionate about helping people build a business that works around your lifestyle. Let's start by imagining for just a second that your blog is a physical store, and each visitor represents a potential reader or subscriber. Imagine that conversation that you would have with someone who walked in your front door for the very first time. What are those questions you would ask them? What would you tell them about yourself and your business? What would that conversation look and feel like? If your website were a brick and mortar business like we see in this picture, your homepage would be that conversation. For a lot of bloggers, it might currently sound a little bit like this.

[00:01:44.180] - Kristen Doyle
Hey, Welcome to my blog. You can read my posts, shop, or learn about me. I write about a lot of different categories. Here are my blog posts, and here is some stuff you can buy from me. Go ahead and get on my email list so I can contact you. Let me tell you all about myself. Okay, bye. In reality, there are four basic questions that every website needs to answer with a few variations here and there, depending on your specific business. But for most businesses, the first thing people need to know when they get to your website is who do you serve? They're thinking to themselves, Do I belong here? You also need to answer the question of how you can help them or how you can solve a problem or a pain point that they have. Your visitors also need to know that you know what you're talking about. You have to answer the question of why they should trust you. And then last but not least, how can they keep learning from you or support your work, whether that is by subscribing, buying your products, exploring your posts, whatever that might look like.

[00:03:09.180] - Kristen Doyle
And unfortunately, a lot of websites don't answer these questions very clearly if they answer them at all. And of course, this is a totally fake site that I made up because I would never throw anyone's real website under the proverbial bus. But if you are looking at this site and feeling like If your site might be making some of these mistakes and it might not be answering those four questions, then you are in the right place. Because our goals today are to spot those hidden website mistakes that could be turning people a way and to show you how you can make your website work harder for you by focusing on what your visitors need most. You'll walk away with actionable tips that you can implement today to create a site that turns more of your visitors into loyal readers and increases your blog's revenue. When someone new lands on your site for the first time, the last thing you want is for them to end up scratching their head and not sure what you're all about. That is why, Mistake number 1 is wasted space above the fold. Above the fold refers to that space that people can see on your website before they ever start to scroll.

[00:04:33.870] - Kristen Doyle
It actually comes from an old newspaper term, referring to what you can see on top of a stack of newspapers above the fold when they were stacked in those paper boxes and people only had the top half of the page to decide if they wanted to purchase that paper or not. See, the statistics show us that you only have a few seconds to make that first impression before someone clicks away from your site. And most often, they make that split-second decision before they ever start to scroll. In our bad website example, there is a huge hero section here, and you can't see anything else until you start to scroll down the page. A vague welcome message like, Welcome to my blog, doesn't give readers any real sense of what they will find on this website or why they should keep reading. Within seconds, your audience should know exactly what your blog offers and how it's relevant to them. Then this Learn More button doesn't really entice visitors to actually click on anything because it isn't clear what they are going to be clicking over to. You have to give them a clear path to follow.

[00:05:52.620] - Kristen Doyle
Using this generic stock photo doesn't add any personality or purpose to your homepage. In fact, stock photos like these can make your blog feel impersonal or forgettable. You want to use an image that matches your content, something like a kitchen scene if you're a food blogger or a family photo if your site focuses on parenting. When you're thinking about your above-the-fold space, make sure you're looking at your site on your laptop, but also on your phone. Over 50% of users are viewing websites sites from their phones, and that number goes up every single time a new study is done. And a lot of times that above the fold space shows even less content on a mobile device than it does on a desktop or laptop. So make sure it's looking good both places. So here are some things that you can try instead. When someone lands on your site, let them know three things right away before they scroll. The first one is that they are in the right place. Having your name, your logo, even a photo of you right here front and center lets people know that they have landed on the site they think they have.

[00:07:16.450] - Kristen Doyle
And an added bonus of having your photo here is it also helps make your site feel a little more personal. You also need to identify who you serve and how you help them right up front and center. Specifically, what problem can you help people solve or can you solve for them? And then make sure you're giving them a clear call to action, a clear first step, a place for them to get started. As a blogger, getting on your email list might be the most important thing for them to do, so put a great opt-in there. Above all, when you are on this hero section, be thinking about your audience plus the problem plus the solution that you offer with a clear call to action. Have you ever been to the Cheese Factory? I remember the first time I ever ate there. They handed me this 20-page, spiral-bound book for a menu, and it was so overwhelming. It took me forever to decide what I wanted. And to be honest, I probably made a panicked decision and just spit out the first thing that came to mind when the server came over to get my order.

[00:08:39.420] - Kristen Doyle
I took a look when I was grabbing this picture, and their website says they have over 250 menu items. Well, there is a term for that overwhelmed that I felt, and it turns out it's something most people experience. It's called decision paralysis. Simply put, it means that when people are given too many choices, we are more likely to walk away than to actually make any choice at all. That is why, Mistake number 2 is options overwhelm. There are dozens of clickable things on our fake homepage. The reality is that most people are only going to click one of them. Because once they do, they're now on a whole different page of your website. They're not nearly as likely to come back to the homepage to click something else as they are to either continue reading that page, click a link on that page to something else on your site, or just walk away from your site completely. The mistake here is treating your website like a table of contents and trying to throw everything on there like the giant cheesecake factory menu. The biggest culprits here are having way too many menu links, too many blog post categories, and just generally trying to show everything on just one page.

[00:10:12.920] - Kristen Doyle
The questions to ask yourself are how can you simplify things? What is it that you most want or need visitors to see and to do from this page? And then simplify your page to the point that everything on the page is pointing to that next step, whatever it is. Here are some practical action steps for this. Start by cleaning up the main menu at the top. Decide which links are most important to keep at the top, and then put the rest of them in the footer navigation, especially those links you know people will look for if they need them, things like your contact page, your privacy policy and terms of use. Another thing I really, really recommend doing is unless growing your social media following is the main thing that is making you money, and if it is, that's great. But if that's not you, then I would highly recommend that you move those social media links out of your header and down into the footer of your site. Because when people click on social media links, you are just inviting them to to get distracted and to forget all about you and your blog because now they're watching reels or they are scrolling other content, mindlessly not thinking about coming back to your website anymore.

[00:11:45.920] - Kristen Doyle
When it comes to what options you give people on the homepage, think less is more. Instead of bombarding visitors with every possible link or all of your blog categories, give them a clear starting point. In this section, we have highlighted three specific posts that are relevant and helpful for the target audience. Things like easy recipes, decluttering tips, family travel planning. When it comes to your blog's categories, highlight the ones that are most important. See, when visitors land on your page, they're probably scanning to see if your blog covers topics they're interested in. So instead of trying to list dozens of topics or cover everything all in one place, pick four or five key topics that best represent the focus of your blog. And while you're at it, be sure that you give those topics names that make it clear how they relate to your audience. For example, here In this screenshot, we have changed the generic travel tips to traveling with kids, recipes to kid friendly recipes, because that's the focus of this fake blog that I made up. A common mistake people make is thinking making that showing more options will make your site appeal to more readers.

[00:13:05.570] - Kristen Doyle
But just like the Cheesecake Factory, too many choices can just be overwhelming. So when you highlight a few key categories, specific posts, you are creating a much more inviting site that encourages readers to explore instead of leaving them feeling overwhelmed or feeling that decision paralysis. Now, I am sure we all have at least one friend who always makes it all about them. When it comes to your website, you do not want to be that person. See, your website visitors don't care about you until they have a reason to. So mistake number three is making the whole page all about you. See, it is easy to fall into the trap of sharing lots of personal details because we think it makes us relatable. But remember, most of all the time, visitors are coming to your blog to find solutions or inspiration for themselves not to hear your life story. It can be tempting to treat your blog like a journal or a diary where you talk about your personal journey and every step that led you to where you are now. But readers usually don't care that much about the backstory unless it directly relates to their own life or provides them with some actionable steps.

[00:14:28.450] - Kristen Doyle
Now, this one might hurt a little bit, but it's true. When it comes to your homepage, your visitors are the most important person, not you. It should be all about your reader and what they are going to get from your content. Let's talk about how to flip the script and make it all about your readers instead of you. In the Hero section, since your headline is the first thing people see, it needs to make a really great great first impression. Skip the generic, Welcome to my blog, and use a headline that highlights the main focus of your content. In this case, we're using tips, recipes, and travel hacks for families on the go. This immediately lets visitors know that they are in the right place. A quick intro beneath your headline can really go a long way in making readers feel at home, too. So instead of talking about yourself, try a sentence or two that shares what they will get out of your content. And then give readers a clear next step that is enticing and relevant. Instead of the Bland Learn More button, go for an email opt-in with something special that they will really want.

[00:15:45.010] - Kristen Doyle
The big thing to remember here is that your Hero section is your chance to connect right away with visitors. So you really want this part of your site to say, Hey, I get you, and I've got exactly what you need. Rephrase your section headings from generic titles to more specific phrases that give readers an idea of how each thing will help them or what they will get out of it. Ask yourself, if a reader only read this heading, would they understand why it is worth their time? Writing clear benefits-focused headings can really be the difference between readers scrolling on or actually clicking to explore more of this content. Every piece of content on your homepage, and really your website in general, should answer the simple question of, Why should my readers care about about this. When you keep the focus on your readers needs, it's a great way to ensure your blog doesn't feel self-centered, and instead it feels like a special resource that you created just for them. The About section is where you have an opportunity to show your visitors that you get their challenges and that you're here to help. So instead of listing out a bunch of hobbies or random facts, focus on those shared experiences or struggles that you have with them.

[00:17:22.530] - Kristen Doyle
Give them a reason to stick around by explaining how your blog can make their life easier or more fun or less stressful, highlighting those ways that you can help them. And keep your text relatable and warm. For example, in our updated website here for Busy Moms, it says, I know how challenging it can be to juggle a busy life, which is why I created this space for practical advice that fits right into your routine. Make sure you are writing like you're speaking to a friend who could really use your help, being empathetic and relatable all all the way through your copy. All right, last but not least, if the web is a big game of hide and seek, then you want to be the first one getting found, never the last. So that is why, Mistake number 4 is for getting about search engine optimization. And that's just the process of getting your pages to rank well in search. Your section headings and your button text can help search engines understand your content. Instead of using generic labels like blog or shop, use more descriptive, keyword-rich phrases that tell both your search engines and your readers what's inside.

[00:18:42.550] - Kristen Doyle
They're more likely to get clicked on that way, but they're also better for SEO. Seo details like titles, meta descriptions, and alt tags might feel small and unimportant, but either leaving them blank or just set to whatever the default is really is a missed opportunity. If your page is about travel tips for families, you want to make sure that your SEO details use those keywords. Most bloggers are actually more likely to get new readers through searches for specific blog posts than they are through your homepage in general. So make sure you're optimizing every post and every page on your website for search. Let's talk about how to do that. You'll want to start by finding relevant comment keywords on a website like Uber Suggest. Type in a few phrases related to your content. For this website, we might search family recipes or travel hacks for moms, and see what people are actually searching for in the Uber Suggest results. Then use those keywords throughout the text on the page. But remember, it should never feel forced or like you're just shoving keywords in. Your content should always read smoothly for real people, not just for search engines.

[00:20:05.890] - Kristen Doyle
When it comes to your blog post, make sure that you are using your main keyword, that most important one for each post, in your page title, in the link, your image file names, the alt text, and in your meta description, as well as incorporating them into the page copy or the text on the page. If you aren't sure exactly what all of those are, just go poking around your website a little because you'll see places to set all of those no matter your website platform. But if you are on WordPress, then I highly recommend you add the Rank Math plugin to help prompt you. Rank Math gives you a little side panel like the one you see here that really helps you know which things you've already done well and which things you still need to work on. As you complete those tasks, those red Xs will turn into green checks and your score will go up. And this is an that you're doing everything right to rank in Google. All right, let's recap those four mistakes that you might be making on your website. Mistake number one is not being clear about who you serve and how you help them above the fold before they ever start to scroll.

[00:21:21.530] - Kristen Doyle
And don't forget that you have to give them that one action step for how they can get started in that hero section as well. Then, Mistake number 2 is throwing everything at your visitors instead of honing in on the things that are most important. What you want to do instead is keep things more streamlined and really guide your visitors to their next step instead of throwing everything at them and making them decide what they should be clicking on. Mistake number 3 is making it all about you instead of focusing on how you are here to help your readers. And then, Mistake 4 is forgetting about optimizing for search.
