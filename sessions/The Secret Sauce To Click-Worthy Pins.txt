Let's talk about Pinterest. Shall we? Hi, there. My name is Ana and I'm a blogging coach and strategist, helping content creators increase their traffic and income online. One of the main ways that I include my blog traffic when I was a new blogger was with Pinterest and really harvesting the power of Pinterest. And in the last couple of years, I've done the same thing for my side blog that I've started [inaudible 00:00:33]. Pinterest does change, and you have to keep up with those things, but there are a couple of things that never change. So, in this video, I want to go over my most clicked Pins. So, here's my presentation about the secret sauce of click-worthy Pins. Don't get me wrong, having Pinterest followers and monthly views on Pinterest is a great thing. And seeing the growth in that means that your Pinterest account is growing and that your content gets distributed further. But when you look at the monthly page views, a lot of people put emphasis on it, while it doesn't necessarily mean that it converts really well into traffic for your blog. So, what I do instead is I focus on Pins that get a really high click-through rate.

[00:01:16.490] - Ana
So that's why I want to focus on this on today's presentations. There's a bunch of Pinterest strategies, resources out there that you can use to set up your account to create those Pins in the first place, and so on. So, I'm not going to be talking about a design perspective from a to-do point of view, but more a checklist on here's what's working for me and what I've noticed working for other Pins, and here's what you should try to replicate in your design and in your Pins look that will actually get you clicks. And again, I will look over Pins from both my main website, which is Blogging Focus, and my pet website, which obviously has a whole different audience to see if there are any overlapping Pins that do really well, or any elements that might [inaudible 00:02:02] on your own Pins that you should really try to incorporate. Basically, I'm going to try to help you create Pins that get you blog traffic. Let's get right into it.

[00:02:12.600] - Ana
So, instead of strategizing and trying to come up with things that I think would get clicks, what I'm going to do instead is go through my two Pinterest accounts. One, which is for my main login website that you can see here, and another for my pet business, just so you can see how it performs in a non-marketing niche as well, and look at the most clicked Pins on there and see if we can spot any reoccurring themes. But first, you might be wondering, how can you tell which Pins get clicks? And there are two main ways, to do it. Before I get into the Pins, I'm going to quickly show you the ways so you can look at your own analytics and understand what's working in your niche or for your own audience, since that's so much more important than looking at what someone else is doing and trying to copy that. So, here it is. This is your business hub on Pinterest. You do need to have a business account to see the analytics. So, if you don't have that already, make sure you convert to a Pinterest account. It's totally free, easy to do.

[00:03:11.280] - Ana
And once you're in here, all you have to do is go to your analytics and overview. Once you get here, you'll see a bunch of data, but don't get too caught up in it. Here's what you need to do. Look at your Pins or standard Pins, because that's what we want to see that is performing, choose a date range. So, I'm going to go ahead and choose the last 90 days and add claim accounts. It's so important to choose your domain. Why? Because I want to see what Pins got click throughs from my own website rather than all the Pins that I added to Pinterest and share. And then I'm going to scroll here to top Pins and they are sorted by impressions, which is not necessarily a bad thing. But like I said, views don't actually equal traffic necessarily on Pinterest. So, just because for my top Pin, I got 26,000 impressions doesn't mean I got 26,000 click-throughs. All I care about is how well these converted. S,o instead I'm going to sort by outbound clicks. Why? Because Pin clicks is also when people click on the pin to enlarge it, it doesn't mean they landed on your website.

[00:04:15.880] - Ana
And outbound clicks is the ones that actually landed on your website from Pinterest. Wait a second for it to refresh. And you'll see here something so, so useful. Not only will you see your top Pins, and then when you hover over them, you see a preview of them and when it was first created, but you would also see the total clicks and the deconversion rate. So, here's something really interesting. The top pin that got the most clicks actually has a pretty low conversion rate, 1.2, is not terrible, but it's lower than my other pin, which has a conversion rate of 3.2. That's actually amazing. And you can see that this pin had 26,000 impressions and this one had way less, but this one converted twice the amount. So, what I like to do in cases like this, I will go over to the pin in question and you can click to view it and then really take this into consideration. This is a pretty simple Pin design that I made with a stock photo and I use it for a couple of different blog posts as well. And that converted really well. So, people really like seeing like a lifestyle shoot of sort that released your niche a little bit, so obviously, somebody blogging.

[00:05:34.370] - Ana
And it converts a little better than something that's just a written pin. But if you remember from analytics earlier, this pin had a lot of distribution. So, Pinterest really made sure people see it. And you can see it's a way taller pin than the pins that I usually make. That's something else that you can experiment with. Have you tried making slightly longer pins? They take more space in your actual feed, so they might be seen by more people. And then you might see something interesting happening in your top pins, which is a couple of designs are exactly the same. So, obviously, this is the exact design. If we click to view it, it converted a little less, but still quite good. And if you look at the difference between this pin and this pin, obviously they're the same image. Here's the main difference. The pin that converted the most was a pin that somebody else pinned to their board. It's one of my pins, but they pinned it there, right? And this pin still did quite well. So, proof that the image itself is converting quite well. But this is a pin that I initially created, and then somebody shared two design tips.

[00:06:41.780] - Ana
So, not the most relevant board to the topic in question, while this one was pinned by somebody else to Blogging. So, obviously, you can control what other people pin from your own pins and what boards they added, but it makes such a difference if they're able to add it to really relevant boards. Something else that I noticed is that my top pins are a combination of pins that were pinned, like, really recently, like November of this year, and a couple of pins I pinned earlier in the year, or one even in 2019. There you go, 2019, and so on. So, a couple of them are pinned last year. It's really a mixed bag, and a lot of the pins do take time to start ranking. If you keep scrolling, you'll probably see the same trend, March 2021, June 2021, 2018. Somebody still getting like a 6% conversion rate for a seasonal pin that I pinned in 2018. That is insane. So, what I'm saying to you is do not get discouraged. Obviously, there are three cases where a pin that you recently pinned could go viral and get loads of impressions and clicks, and obviously, that's the best case scenario, but that's not going to happen.

[00:07:52.470] - Ana
But what you want to do is make sure you push and distribute pins that you published a while back, especially for seasonal content. Just bring it back. Like, I pinned this originally in 2018, and it still brought me clicks and a 6% conversion rate. And especially around Christmas, I want to make sure to repin this exact image again by finding the initial pin. You also see that Pinterest recommends that I promote it as well, which is an interesting piece of insight. They're basically saying this could be relevant now. This converts really well for you, get more views to it. I don't usually promote my Pinterest pins. Pinterest is great for organic traffic if you're patient with it. But if you're one of trying to speed up your results, and if you see a Pin converts really well, and on the other side of that blog post, you have affiliate links or your own product that you can monetize, then by all means to try to put some ad budget behind it and see how it does. Because Pinterest could just get it in front of more people who would then convert at 6% or more.

[00:08:52.200] - Ana
So, obviously, that's a great piece of insight. I would never try to promote a Pin that I have no information about or how it's performing. But this really tells you what works and what doesn't. Something else that you might have noticed about my Pins is that they are all quite text-heavy because all of them don't have images like this one, although those do perform well. So, that's something for me to experiment with and add more kind of focus points for my photos. But a lot of them are really easy to read. You don't need, like in a busy feed, you're not trying to read the words. I make sure that my designs are really easy to read when you kind of scroll past it and that they have these kind of key points that people are getting drawn to. So, here like self-publish, ebook, things like that really stand out in pins like this. So, keep in mind that people don't see your Pin like this, they see it in a whole board like this. So, Pins that really stand out tend to be the ones that have really big keywords where you can kind of see. That's a little hard, like the great, it's kind of hard to see or read quickly.

[00:09:56.880] - Ana
It doesn't really draw the attention. But something like this, I spotted domain authority right away. This is quite a good one. This really brings the focus to the middle and leaves a little space to create that airiness around it. So, go through your own feed and see what kind of stands out. Like, this is a little too busy, on its own, would look really good. But when you kind of zoom out, it's so much happening in a whole feed that it wouldn't really be drawn to go to it. So that's something else that I try to watch for my Pins. And you might have noticed that a lot of my main designs that are getting clicks and so are not really very busy. I just keep them light. I just keep them focused on specific things like that one, and they do get clicks and they do convert. Now I'm going to do the same and take you behind the scenes of my other newer Pinterest account. Like you see here, I have like under 200 followers compared to the 40,000 that I have for my main account, but it still does quite well. I just don't post on it that often.

[00:10:59.780] - Ana
And it's a way newer account. So Pinterest takes a while to really trust your accounts and Pins. But I'm going to go analyze a couple of non-marketing Pins for you to see what works with maybe different audiences and see if I can learn anything about it myself. So, I'm going to go again to analytics overview. Again, make sure you're selecting traffic that comes to your own. Give it 90 days, so you can really track the progress. And we're going to go to top pins. I had a pin there that was seasonal for Halloween a while back, and it performed really, really well. But again, this is a Pin that I published in 2020, and it just now took off. Like, look at that. Even better than my main account Impressions in the last 90 days, which shows the power that even if you have a smaller Pinterest account and niche or you're starting it for a new blog, be patient with it. Because sometimes it just takes that little bit of time for Pinterest to resurface your content. So, again, I'm going to go by outbound clicks. No surprise that Pin is my top one, right?

[00:12:06.810] - Ana
So, it did really well for Halloween for funny dog costumes. The second one converted really well. Again, 4% conversion rate is actually quite good. And it's a Frenchie gift guide. So, pretty simple. Again, really easy to spot both the image and the breed. And the message is reinforced by Frenchie at the top and then must have and kind of the shopping list is basically what the post is. So, I think this Pin does a really good job at telling people what's on the other side. That's why it converted. And this is a Pin that I myself saved to obviously, a French bulldog board. So, something else that's really important in that, you might have noticed already in the trend of these Pins that get clicks and get resurfaced and really get pushed by Pinterest is Pinterest is sure of the topic. They know what the topic is about and that has a lot to do with the boards that it gets added to. And then we have a couple of really simple ones that, again, I created in Canva. And I just tried to add that visual element of plants for turtles. So, so, so simple.

[00:13:15.060] - Ana
You just need to draw people in, make sure you have some visual cues, because people do look on Pinterest very visually. And for this niche, it works a lot better than having just text alone, right? I can get away with it on my blogging business Pinterest, because there's not many images that I can use. You can only use so many images of laptops, but for other niches, the visual element is so, so important. So, do not think like that. Same goes for this Pin, where not only you have the visual element, but an arrow, which really draws the attention to, hey, this is what I'm referring to. Harnesses, right? Pay attention to this bit of the image, which you can also do if you have busier images. Just try to pull the focus and pull the attention on there. This also converted quite well. It's one of those taller pins that I experimented with. And again, it really seems like it did well. It also has a comment in there, which is interesting because I did notice this for a couple of my top Pins on both accounts, they have comments. They have some sort of engagement.

[00:14:19.080] - Ana
People don't really use Pinterest comments, but I just think that any engagement to your Pins really draws Pinterest to push your Pin further. So that's something that I maybe would experiment with in the future, trying to interact back and reply to people and trying to kind of start a conversation in the comments. If you get comments, or even the ones that are not too spammy, I will just leave them there. Obviously, if it's just like random links or stuff like that, I will delete those comments. But other than that, try to leave your comments there because it's good engagement. And then something else that I do, just to make sure that Pinterest knows and associates my Pin with the right topic, is that I try to vary the title of the Pin itself from what's written on the image. Pinterest can read, so their software can read words, especially when it's written and easier to read a font. I often have two or more Pins for the same post, so I do experiment with the titles and change them. But even on Pins where obviously this is the title of that Pin, I'll use synonyms or words that other people might use.

[00:15:23.530] - Ana
So, something like cockapoos, and then cocker spaniels dog names, because people just read them in specific ways. And then I make sure to have a description. There's all the Pins that you've noticed that got clicks on both accounts. They all had a really good title and a really good description. Do not miss out on that. You could really be missing out on opportunities to tell Pinterest what your Pin is about and work on that Pinterest SEO. So, again, all these clicks and things like that that come to this account are all Pinterest SEO. So, obviously, all these pins and so much more that come from it are not for my followers, because I have a very small following, but it's from Pinterest SEO. So, people who look those things up and found me in search. And then something else that I really noticed for this blog is that a lot of designs are different. So, I work with about four or five different designs for this blog that I kind of reuse. And a lot of the ones that are top there just seems to be different ones. It's not necessarily one design that does really well.

[00:16:21.610] - Ana
It's more topic-focused. So, it's about the actual topic and how well a job I do. But I would definitely pay the attention to the top Pins that you have there and the ones that are converting really well. Like this one converted at 5%. Again, really, really good. And it's because the text on it is really, really specific. And then the image draws attention. And you can see here that the dog is looking up at the text. So, use your images in a way that it draws attention to the content itself. Like I said, with arrows, with people looking in a specific direction, it really draws people's eyes in a busy feed to that. And again, work on your title. Work on those differences. So, new pull harnesses, pull harnesses for bulldogs, for French bulldogs, make sure to improve your actual title because you have more space there than on the actual Pin and save it to a relevant board. So, like pet product reviews, right? And then something else that you can look at just to see how they're performing is your boards as well. So, pay attention to the boards that are doing quite well impression wise, or even the ones that are getting the most clicks.

[00:17:30.730] - Ana
Again, this would be different. And you kind of can keep scrolling. And make sure to add more Pins to those boards. Those are boards who are already performing for you, so add more Pins to it. It's really that simple. It's really about distributing your Pins to the right places, so that Pinterest distribute them further than your own following. And then really quick, I'm going to show you the second place where you can go to check out your traffic from Pinterest in really, really specific terms. So, this is using the Google Analytics data on your blog. So, you want to go to Acquisition, overview, social, and network referrals. When you go here, you just want to go to Pinterest, which you can see is my top referring social account. And then you see exactly which posts are getting traffic from Pinterest. So, let's say, for example, my $50,000 income report. And once you click on it, it will tell you where the traffic is coming from. And when it just says Pinterest, Pinterest, Pinterest, it means they couldn't track exactly the design or it came from like mobile traffic, which they can really track. This really shows me, because I saw this trend a lot, is that a lot of my audience is using Pinterest on their phone.

[00:18:41.690] - Ana
That's how they're getting to my website. That's how they're finding my Pins. So, really, really make sure that your Pins designs do stand out in mobile feed as well. So, look through the Pinterest app on your phone to see what works and what doesn't. But you'll notice that a couple of the Pins here have like longer numbers. And these are the actual Pins that are driving traffic. So, when you get here, if you want to see the Pin design, all you have to do is just copy it, open a new tab, paste it in there and this is the Pin that performed, right. Again, we can see a couple of comments in there. So, there's engagement. I have the Amazon banner right there which draws people's attention since this is an Amazon affiliate tutorial. And this was even saved to something called Amazon marketing. This goes to show that no matter what we try to do with our own accounts is a Pinterest community that dictates which Pins perform well or not. So, other people adding your Pins to relevant boards is such a vital thing for your Pin and obviously, you can't always be in control of it.

[00:19:44.570] - Ana
But if you have tailwind, as you can see, I have the tailwind publisher. They do have tailwind communities that are very niche specific. So, I'm in a lot of blogging one or pet ones for my pet blog and we kind of share each other's Pins. But the ones in the pet communities are obviously pet bloggers. So, they add my Pins to really relevant boards. And that really makes a difference, especially when you have like a newer account. And you can kind of go back on here and look through your other Pins and try to find the Pin designs that are really performing. So, this is the same thing. Find these little Pin numbers and they all will be usually for different Pins. Paste it in and then you'll see the ones that are performing quite well. So, again, this is an older one that seems to be driving some traffic. Keep at it, really try to improve your Pinterest account per se, and then take into account these different Pin designs that do work for you. You'll be able to kind of see a couple added lands. And what I try to do as well with my Pins is just keep them similar, a little different, but quite similar in how they look, just so that the branding is a little consistent and people know it's my blog.

[00:20:54.650] - Ana
So, you'll see a lot of this blue that I have in my logo and things like that, kind of show up in different places, and then you can really grow your monthly views. But I know there are people who have way more monthly views who are not really getting the traffic back to their website from that. So, don't get hung up on that and really try to learn from your own experiences and your own analytics.

[00:21:18.300] - Ana
And that was it. Those were my Pins that I did really well for me in the past or that are doing well now. Keep in mind that even Pins with really high click-through rates go through periods of time of not seeing that traffic immediately. So, don't get discouraged. A lot of these Pins didn't start picking up that traffic until Pinterest started to distribute them accordingly. But there's only so much you can do with the numbers that you have. So that's why I look at the click-through rate and I see the traffic that I get from those pins in correlation to the impressions rather than always comparing them to each other. Because you can have pins that have a much higher click through rate, but because they're not getting distributed as much on pinterest, it looks like they're bad pins. And that's also not the case. Keep in mind that Pinterest is definitely a long term game. You might have noticed that a lot of these pins were from the past years, where I actually published for the first time, and it takes a little bit for them to gain traction. So, one of the most important things that I would have to advise you on is definitely have patience with it.

[00:22:17.690] - Ana
Do check on your analytics often enough to see any spikes in traffic that you might have missed, but have patience with them. And don't give up on pin designs or on these Pinterest treks until you've actually given them time to both implement them and experiment with them. And let Pinterest kind of index the new pins that you have. If there's one thing that I noticed with these pins and most of my pins that end up bringing traffic is that none of them did really well in the first few months. So, definitely don't get discouraged by that and really trust the process and focus on the Pinterest SEO in the background. I know my presentation was a lot about the pin design and what you should have in there, and bits and pieces of it do have to do with the SEO, both the visual SEO of Pinterest, because Pinterest is a very visual platform. And the actual words you write out on those pins do matter, both for the click-through rate and for Pinterest to index a pin and categorize it accordingly. But the things that you add on top of that when you publish a pin also really matter.

[00:23:21.340] - Ana
I'm talking about your title, your descriptions, and the boards that it ends up living in. That's still so important. And I don't want to stray away from the topic of my presentation for too long, but if you already are a master of pin designs and you wanted to look deeply into my pins are doing great, how can I make them do even better? I would then look at your Pinterest SEO. That being said, I'll share a couple of really, really quick tips on how to do that. Number one, be super mindful of the boards that you add the pin to. The first board matters the most. So, the first time an image hits Pinterest, they look at where you add it first, especially if you own the domain where that pin is linked to. Right? Because if you claim your website, you own that domain. They trust you to tell them where those pins should live and where they should be categorized. So, the board that you pin an image to the first time, it's so important and it really embeds that Pin in all the information around it. So, from your board title, description, and other pins that live in that pin, they all matter and they all give their information back to the main Pin that you add in there.

[00:24:31.270] - Ana
To simplify this, if you have a Pin about Christmas recipes and then you add a Thanksgiving recipe in there, Pinterest is going to be confused, right? They're going to categorize that pin as a Christmas recipe rather than a Thanksgiving recipe, which may cause you to miss out on being ranked for that as well. Now, that being said, you can add a Pin to multiple boards that are relevant. So, if it happens to be a chicken roast recipe and you add it to all these different recipes, it can gain information from all these different boards as a potential to rank for it. That's not a problem, but the main one should be your priority. So, what are you trying to rank for, first and foremost? And make sure to add it to boards that line up with that first. What I'm saying is that at the end of the day, the Pinterest algorithm is an algorithm, right? They can only take the information you give them about a Pin and they take that from the end article as well. So the article you could link to, but also the added information you add to it, such as the Pin title and the description.

[00:25:26.810] - Ana
So use those places wisely, especially when you're trying to add new keywords in there. And of course, the most important takeaway that I hope you also got from today's presentation is to experiment with the Pin designs. Create multiple pins for the same blog post, article, or end page where you want to draw users to, different things work for different people, they might be distributed differently, and also you might never know what gets people to click. So, experiment with that. Go back through the things that we talked on today's presentation about those really high click-worthy pins, and hopefully, you'll be able to replicate that success moving forward on your own Pinterest account.

[00:26:05.730] - Ana
If that's the case, definitely reach out and tell me. I would love to see that for you guys and you can find me on my YouTube channel, on my blog, She Approach, and all social media related to that. So, reach out to me and I would love to celebrate with you on your Pinterest success. See you soon and I hope you enjoy the rest of the summit.
