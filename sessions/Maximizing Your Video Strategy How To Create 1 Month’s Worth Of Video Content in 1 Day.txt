All right, guys. I am excited for this next session with Trina Little. Thank you, Trina. Welcome. Hi.

[00:00:05.680] - Speaker 2
Thank you for having me.

[00:00:07.720] - Speaker 3
Yes, because I'm like, I need to know how to do this because you're going to talk about creating videos, which I feel takes... I was really working on doing videos with each blog post last year, and I stopped doing that because it just felt like it was slowing me down. And so I'm really excited for your session because you're going to be teaching us about how to create, what did you say, a month's worth of videos in...

[00:00:31.220] - Speaker 1
One day. In one day.

[00:00:32.890] - Speaker 3
Okay. Yeah. Yeah, I definitely need to know that. All right. So can you tell us a little bit about your background, what got you into this, and then the highlights of what we're going to cover?

[00:00:43.940] - Speaker 2
Yeah. So I come from a business background. I have a master's in business. And prior to 2015, I just thought YouTube was a place for cat videos. I actually was using YouTube on my own, uploading videos of my friends and I when we traveled. And so it was an easy way to share videos to them because we lived across the country. When I got pregnant the first time, I went down the YouTube hole because I had no idea what was happening to me. And so I was finding other people that were also pregnant for the first time sharing their journey. And I realized when my business mind clicked with this YouTube piece, how it all worked together. And I saw how people were creating communities and really creating this know, like and trust. In fact, I used one of the channels that I was watching in 2015 as the place that I went to get all of my baby registry stuff. And then just some person who I had watched for weeks and trusted what she told me to get in my register. So I really started to see how this all fits in a marketing strategy and how it could really change the game in business, even back in 2015.

[00:01:54.990] - Speaker 2
And so I started playing with YouTube. I started trying to figure it out, see how it worked. And as I started creating videos, I started getting asked questions like, how did you add a thumbnail? How did you know what's the title it? How did you do this? And so I saw the opportunity, and I took the jump and started teaching people how to do YouTube and also managing YouTube channels. And so it's just snowballed from there.

[00:02:19.550] - Speaker 3
Okay, that's awesome. So what are the high points or the steps we're going to learn today so that you can create a month worth of videos in a day?

[00:02:27.800] - Speaker 1
Yeah.

[00:02:28.340] - Speaker 2
So I talk a lot about YouTube because that's my sweet spot because I use YouTube as the hub of my content. But today I'm going to talk to you how to get started with that video that you could put on YouTube. And so it's going to be three steps to super simple video creation that I use to grow my YouTube, Instagram and Facebook, plus my email list and attract more clients by using this three step. I'm also how to create video content that looks professional because I know a lot of the times we don't want to stuff out there that doesn't look super professional. So I'm going to get you covered there. And then most importantly, how you can start implementing today all of the stuff that I just talked about and do it in your business, just like we said, eight hours a month.

[00:03:13.860] - Speaker 3
Wow. Okay. I am excited. Let's get going. All right, let's go.

[00:03:19.540] - Speaker 1
All right, so let's get started. I have my notes right over here alongside of me. So if you see me picking over there, I'm just making sure I'm getting you all the content that I have jam-packed into this presentation for you because I don't want you to miss anything. I just want to get to know you here a little bit, start chatting in the chat box. I would love to hear from you to know if anyone here has ever felt like they're spinning their wheels when it comes to creating content, blog posts, Instagram posts, Pinterest pins, all the stuff that goes into blogging. Do you ever feel like you're just going through the motions, but nothing ever seems to move needle forward. No matter what you do, you can't get more traffic to that blog, and it's just like, what the heck should you do next? Today, I want to talk about when I first started my business real quick, I was juggling it all. I had every single hour of my day down. To say I had calendar blocking down to a T is an understatement. Every single minute of my day was blocked with something that had to be done.

[00:04:30.120] - Speaker 1
I only had so many childcare hours, so I really needed to maximize those hours to get everything done on my to-do list because it was always so massive to do. The only problem with having every single thing down in my schedule and mapped out was I didn't map in my calendar time for a little boy to have a 104-degree fever. I didn't have time for when the internet went out for four hours. I didn't block in time into my schedule when I was struggling with postpartum depression and creating content just wasn't going to happen because I just couldn't get out of bed that day. Maybe you're dealing with depression, maybe you're dealing with juggling blogging and childcare. But the thing is, we are not thinking about our time effectively. This is This is exactly when I realized when this guy woke up that morning and had that fever and he couldn't go to childcare, and I thought, Crap, I already have these things that need to get done today. What's going to happen next? This is exactly when I realized it It's time to maximize my content, the content that I was already creating, and create a system so I wasn't constantly worried about running on the content creation hamster wheel, and I had space in my schedule, in my daily life, to take care of my family and myself when I needed to.

[00:06:04.940] - Speaker 1
I want to take just a second here for you to calculate how many hours in a week are you actually spending creating content. I'm talking blogging, maybe this Pinterest graphics for that blog. Maybe you have a newsletter, maybe you don't. Maybe you're posting about your blog on Instagram. All of that content you're creating, I want you to drop that in the chat box. How many hours a week week do you think you are spending creating content? I'm going to take a minute, let you really think about that because it's a huge question, right? Is it 5 hours? Maybe 10? Maybe you have no idea because you're doing it all the time. But the more important question we need to ask is, is creating this content actually working for you? Moving that needle forward, getting you more traffic to your blog? I want to talk about this theory of time. This is Parkinson's law that work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion. Maybe it's taking you 5, 10, 15 hours to create your content because you aren't putting parameters on your time. You're like me. You're thinking, it's going to take me five hours to write this blog post.

[00:07:20.000] - Speaker 1
I'm blocking five hours. It's going to take me three hours to plan out my Instagram content, so I'm blocking three hours. Like I said, I was blogging all of my hours for content creation, and my days quickly became jam-packed. I felt like I could never get everything done because every single minute was scheduled. So if any hiccup showed up, I was stuck, right? Here's the thing. Most of us started blogging, or maybe we even started a business around our blog to set our own hours, to work when we wanted to, to spend more time with our family, not work all the time, not let our blog and our content creation take over our life. That's exactly where I was at. When something came up, I had no flexibility. I had no time in my schedule to live. I want to know, real life right here, we're getting raw and real. Is your content controlling your life right now? Is it controlling your life because that's what they, the experts, say? They say the more content, the better. If you aren't cranking out content every single day, you're behind and you're going to fail. That's what they're saying.

[00:08:27.790] - Speaker 1
Maybe this is what your day looks right now. Your life is consumed with that content creation. It's all you ever do. And that's not how you envision life when you started this blog. Here's what no one tells you. I'm going to tell you a little secret that nobody tells you. Make less content, but do it better. In 2018, when my son had that fever, so back to that first slide, in my entire calendar was thrown out of whack for that week, I I had to make a change. I couldn't keep living this way because it just wasn't sustainable. I started creating less content in 2019, and I set parameters that I was not working on Fridays. Tuesdays and Thursdays were my big work days because Wednesday and Monday, I had preschool pickup and drop off, and I wanted to be there for preschool pickup and drop off. So Monday and Wednesday were only half days for me. And during that time in not only did my business, my revenue in my business, double and I hit that six-figure business revenue club, I did less content creation. I created less. So if you're ready to see how, go ahead and tell me you're ready in the chat because we are going to dig right on in.

[00:09:50.280] - Speaker 1
So if we haven't met yet, hi, I am Trina. I am a YouTube and video content strategist. I have a master's degree in business, and I really help business owners scale their business through video content. I've been using YouTube and video content in my business since I started over five years ago, because when I started my business, I knew the fastest way to build my authority and be looked at as legit and create those relationships quicker. I had to show up on video. I knew absolutely nothing about editing, filming, cameras, microphones, none of that stuff. So I had to self-teach myself all of that, plus self-teach myself everything about YouTube because back then there wasn't really a whole YouTube culture yet. Now with my YouTube strategy and my video content strategy and the way I multiply my content that I'm about to show you. I have a sales team of videos on YouTube and my blog working for me 24 hours a day, seven days a week, constantly driving me new traffic. Now I can enjoy three-day weekends with my little ones. When I need some mommy time alone, I can have that because I've created this space and got off of that content creation hamster wheel.

[00:11:13.720] - Speaker 1
Video content has allowed me to get my time back in my day to actually live my life and in return, scale my business. Right now, maybe you're stressed. You feel like you've never had time to do everything before. How are you going to have time to do video content. You're probably already creating loads of content as it is, Instagram, your blog, like we said. And you're like, Yes, Trina. Yes, I am ready to get off of that content creation hamster wheel. Or maybe you're ready to have brands actually reach out to you to want to sponsor a blog post or want to work with you on a blog post. Or maybe you want to see that affiliate income clicking up and up and up because you have more people coming to your blog and you have more people wanting to buy the things that you're talking about in your blog. So let's dig in. We get stuck in this cycle of doing the same things in our business or on our blog over and over again because that's the way we've always done it. We get really comfortable, right? That's the way they say it works.

[00:12:18.290] - Speaker 1
I talked about this infamous they, or it's what I know, right? You already have this blog writing system in process. You're good, you're comfortable, you're in your safe little box, right? Well, what we have been seeing more and more in the past few years is studies show us we are spending over 2 hours a day on social media. So maybe that's why you're starting to reach out and create more content on different platforms like Instagram and Pinterest because you know you can get more people to buy your affiliate links or make your blog look more valuable to brands. But you don't have to keep recreating new content to put out on these platforms. You need to start thinking about that content smarter and creating a repurposing strategy so that you're not creating new content over and over. Back to that hamster wheel again, right? So how are you going to break out on these platforms a lot faster without creating more content? Well, that's what we're here to talk about today. We're here to talk about video, but it's time to get strategic with your videos. Otherwise, creating any video out there for any social platform or your blog is basically like throwing spaghetti at a wall.

[00:13:29.740] - Speaker 1
It It may stick, it may drive more traffic, or it could fall completely flat. So I really want to help you make sure those videos are really working for you. So that's what I'm going to talk about, why we need to focus on using YouTube as the hub of our content. And I know as bloggers, this can be a little bit scary because you're like, I'm already creating blogs. That's my jam. I'm not on YouTube. But I really want to walk you through the importance of YouTube because it's the second largest search engine in the world, and it's owned by Google, which I know so many of you are trying to show up at the top of Google search. I'm going to talk about how YouTube and implementing this clear video strategy on YouTube is going to help you get two posts showing up on the front page of Google, right? You also need to remember that this year alone, in 2020, over 80% of internet traffic is going to be to video. So it's time for you as a blogger to really accept that video is that next step to see the growth in your blog that you really want to see.

[00:14:34.510] - Speaker 1
Also, YouTube has grown significantly. You can see on mobile devices alone, YouTube reaches more adults ages 18 to 49 than primetime television Vision. I'm talking like, this is us. Youtube reaches the same amount of people as this is us. Over 50% of YouTube's audience is female. So if you're really targeting those women, those moms, this is your place. 68% of 68% of YouTube users watch video to help them make a purchase decision. So why not have your affiliate link in that YouTube video so they can purchase that product after watching your video talk about it? And 80% of YouTube users who watch the video to help them make a purchase decision said they watched the video at the beginning of the shopping process. This just goes to show how important incorporating some type of a YouTube video into your blog post is really going to finally move that needle forward in your business. In fact, YouTube is one of the fastest-growing platforms. We hear a lot about Facebook and how it's the largest platform. But in 2018 alone, YouTube grew the largest out of all of these platforms. People use YouTube 63% more than they did in the previous year.

[00:15:50.990] - Speaker 1
So you can see how what really this is the platform to be at here in 2020. Again, if you think, well, my audience is on Facebook or on Pinterest. If you look at this chart, it's a little confusing to read, but if you go over to the up top, use YouTube. 95% of people who use YouTube use Twitter. 95% of people who use YouTube... I'm sorry, I said that wrong. 95% of people who use Twitter, also use YouTube. 95% of people who use Instagram, also YouTube. 87% of people who use Facebook, also use YouTube. If you go down all of those, people use YouTube widely across all these platforms. So whether you think they're on Pinterest or they're on Snapchat, your audience is also using YouTube. But I don't want you to fear. I'm thinking, holy cow, a new platform. Like I said, I don't have the time to do video. My to-do list is already jam-packed. We don't need to be overwhelmed. There is a simple, easy to follow formula that you can use to create a month's worth of video for all of the platforms in just eight hours. And you'll be able to permanently remove some of those to-dos on your list with a repurposing plan that gets you on more platforms, reaching more people, and spending less time doing it.

[00:17:08.580] - Speaker 1
So can I get a praise hand emoji, like something down in the comments that you're excited to hear this step-by-step platform? I just want to address a couple of little things that might be holding you back from actually committing to this before we jump in. So maybe you're thinking, Well, Trina, I'm already creating content. That's fantastic. That's amazing. I'm going to show you how this content is going really help you in my step by step plan. But videos really increase that know, like and trust. It feels like that viewer knows you, and this is going to skyrocket your credibility and make you look much more valuable to a brand When they are looking for partners for sponsored posts, they know you have that connection with your audience because you're showing up on video and making that extra step with that connection. Maybe you're telling me, Trina, well, I'm already doing blog posts, so my time is booked. I totally understand I'm doing blog posts, too. But what makes my blog post more valuable in Google's eyes is I am embedding my video to my blog. So not only does my blog post show up at the top of Google Search for a lot of my search terms because Google, I'm sorry, is going to put my videos at the top of Search.

[00:18:22.060] - Speaker 1
They're going to put my blogs at the top of Search because they know that blog has video content and they value video content. So not only does blog pop to the top of Google Search, but also my YouTube video is at the top of Google Search. So now instead of having no content at the top of Google Search for certain keywords, I now have two, a blog post and a YouTube video. Super, super powerful when it comes to Google SEO. Or maybe you're thinking, Okay, cool. Yeah, I get it, but my people just aren't on YouTube. And that's a logical statement, and I totally get it. But like I said, to that, do your people search Google Like I said, YouTube is the second largest search engine. Google owns YouTube and your content can show up in Google, even if you have both YouTube and Google. Finally, the last one I really want to hit home is, what if YouTube is just a fad, Trina? There's TikTok, there's Snapchat, there was the other Periscope. What if it's just a fad and they waste my time? Look, more and more brands are looking to the YouTube world to make lucrative brand deals with creators.

[00:19:29.260] - Speaker 1
Why? Because most of those people on YouTube share a deeper connection with their audience by showing up on video on YouTube. So brands know that their people will buy what they recommend. A great story is, I'm not sure if you follow the beauty world, But Shane Dawson had this makeup launch back in October, and he had never did anything makeup-wise before. But he took people on the journey. He shared the video process, and that collection blew out makeup statistics across the board. It sold out in less than a few hours. The reason why is because the viewers were invested. The viewers felt connected. He created that relationship with them, and that just made his merchandise, his products, way more valuable. That makes his name as a creator way more valuable to brands out there moving forward. Let's just sit to all those excuses. I broke it all down, and let's start getting strategic with our time content. If you're ready, let me know you are ready. You are ready to roll. You want to know my process. We're going to walk through this three-step process. It's going to go research. If you want to write this down, research, create, and then repurpose.

[00:20:45.050] - Speaker 1
We're going to make sure you're repurposing the wrong way because there is a wrong way to repurpose. Let's jump into step one research. You really need to think about the videos, especially if you're going to be creating them on YouTube. Even if you're going to be creating them for your blog, you want You want to make sure you're creating content that your audience is searching for so that when they go to Google to search for something, your blog posts are actually showing up, your videos are actually showing up. Because the worst thing I want to happen for you is to spend time creating your videos and then have crickets. That's the worst thing that can happen. I want to help you minimize this. When you're researching, we're going to look at YouTube, we're going to look at Pinterest, and you want to check some Facebook groups as well. What this looks like when you go to YouTube is YouTube is going to give you video ideas. Youtube is going to give you a blog post ideas. All you have to do is go into YouTube and go to the search bar and start typing out a topic, any topic that you want to talk about.

[00:21:44.100] - Speaker 1
It's really easy to figure out these videos because as you start typing it in, I started typing in when to post to Instagram. And these are the actual search terms that are most popular on YouTube. People are searching this. So create a post about this. So whatever your niche is, just go in to YouTube search and start typing in that niche and see what YouTube is populating for you. This is another example. I started typing in brand photography. I have a lot of photographers that are students of mine. And so when I type in brand photography, you can see video ideas, blog post ideas right off the bat. Brand photography tips, brand photography ideas, brand clothing for brand photoshoot. So what can you wear during a brand photography? Again, YouTube is giving you all the details to make sure when you post a video or you upload a blog or write a blog, you don't hear cricket. Now, if we move... I'm sorry, I'm a mover, so it's hard for me to sit still. If we go over to Pinterest and type in the same thing, brand photography. You can see the actual search terms people are using on Pinterest.

[00:22:49.140] - Speaker 1
Again, because we want to make sure we're getting in front of our audience's eyes quicker and faster. So brand photoshoot ideas, brand photography, brand photography inspiration. These are the types of topics you want to be creating blog posts around to really skyrocket the traffic to your blog. Here's another one, what to post on Instagram. If you just start scrolling through here, you can see all of those headlines and what people are actually reading on Instagram to really help you figure which blogs you should be writing and turning into video content, more importantly. You're going to spend about 30 minutes. Remember, we're breaking this down into eight hours. This only is going to take you eight hours. Remember Parkinson's law? Work expands to the amount of time you give it. You're going to research four videos, a 30 minutes for each video. This is the really important part because I don't want you wasting time on the wrong videos. I want you to move your needle. I want you to move the needle forward on your blog the fastest way possible. You're going to research these videos. You're going to spend 30 minutes on one video.

[00:23:59.010] - Speaker 1
We're going to do four at time because remember, there are four weeks in a month. You're going to spend two hours researching these videos. Before you're like, holy heck, I don't have two hours, remember, this is your content. Think about all that time you're creating on content. Once a week. You only have to do this once a month. So two hours. Now tell me in the chat, how are you coming up with your video ideas right now or your blog post ideas? Let me know in the chat. A lot of people go to Google, some go to Facebook Facebook, I want to hear from you where you're getting your ideas right now. Let's move into step two, which is create. Here's the key to making a video super easy for you and also quicker, because what happens is people spend a lot of time filming their video, and then they have this massive raw video file, and then it takes them hours to edit it. By following this formula I'm about to share with you, it's going to help you save time filming, it's going to help you save time editing, it's going to help you save time repurposing, which is the key here.

[00:25:03.530] - Speaker 1
Remember, we're saving time and get you more action takers, get you more affiliate revenue, get you more people following you and being more valuable to a brand. So here is that formula. Get your pen out. This is exactly how you're going to craft a script for your videos. You need to be able to hook your audience in the first 5 seconds of your video, because if you can hook them in the first 3-5 seconds, they're going to decide or not to click off of your blog or your video. Remember, we want them to watch you, to build that extra special relationship with you. When they see you on video, they're going to be able to connect with you, but you have to hook them first. They got to watch your content first. When I talk about hooking your video, I'm talking about really thinking about that pain point they're struggling. Let's say you have an Amazon affiliate for organizing, right? You're thinking about that person on the other end who's really struggling with organizing their refrigerator. Let me talk about a topic that I struggle with. You're talking about organizing your refrigerator, and you're going to list all of these products you recommend buying on Amazon.

[00:26:11.340] - Speaker 1
You want to think about where is that person really struggling with that you're going to get them bought into what you're about to share. You may hook them with something. Maybe you even show your refrigerator before, or you say something like, If you're tired of never being able to find anything in your refrigerator and constantly finding expired food, I'm going to show you in this video how to clean up your refrigerator and make your refrigerator look more pinches-worthy. Again, I'm just coming up with that at the top of my head, thinking about the pain point that I struggle with. I have food that goes expired. I don't even know there's some stuff in there because it's tucked around in the back. So you really want to think about that pain point that that audience is struggling with that they're going to buy into your video. So hook them. When you're going to move into your intro and you want to keep this really short, remember, they're bought into your hook. They need to see the meat of that content pretty quickly. So this is just your elevator pitch, your name, your title, and who you serve.

[00:27:09.890] - Speaker 1
So for me, in every single video that I create, I say, Hi, welcome back. My name is Trina. And on this channel, I help you build your confidence on YouTube. Super simple to the point. They know they've come here to build their confidence on YouTube. Then you've got to get to that content, the meat of your content within the first 15 to 30 seconds. And you really want to be able to share that in a step-by-step process. You probably already do this on your blog post, so you're already thinking in that way. So steps, lessons, advice, go through that process and easy to follow. Then here is the key to get action-takers, to get people to buy from your affiliate or to follow you more often or to become that loyal following. Now, there is a strategy if you're looking to grow on YouTube as well, build that presence on YouTube. You do that as well. But you really want to customize just the ending of your video. So the last 10 seconds of your video, you may do four different endings so that we can cut that in in editing to look like it's been made for every single platform.

[00:28:13.850] - Speaker 1
Ten second ending four different platforms, that's like a minute of your time, right? So in YouTube, you may say, watch that next video where I share how I shop for my organization tools, or maybe you tell them to subscribe to your channel. Instagram, maybe if you post it to Instagram TV or Instagram stories. Maybe you say something like DM me, comment below. Or Facebook, maybe you say something like share this video with another friend that's struggling with their refrigerator woes or like this page for more content like this. This is what's going to absolutely make your content stand out amongst the rest. So again, putting this all into eight hours, right? I only want you to spend about 10 to 15 minutes scripting this video. Every single video should be spent 10 to 15 minutes scripting it. We don't have to write word for word. Just know where your content is going. And I find that when you do read from a teleprompter or when you worry about reading word for word, it stresses you out more. So really hone in on that hook. That's the most important part, then let the middle of the content flow a little bit and have this alternate ending.

[00:29:21.030] - Speaker 1
So it's going to take you about an hour to script these four videos. So we're looking at three hours of time right now. Then you're going to give yourself about an hour and to film. Remember, we are putting time limits on this. We do not have to shoot this massive video. We don't have to shoot a massive video. 5, 10 minutes, that's all you really need to do. Just give them the very quick ways to get a clear win at the end of your video. You're spending about an hour and a half to film those videos. Ten minutes for each video, you're good. You're building that trust. Now, I know showing up on video can be scary. You're looking at all the other people that are already doing this on YouTube and you're like, Holy cow, I'm not as good as them. I'm not as pretty as them. My voice sounds terrible. Maybe you're older and you're like, I've got wrinkles. I've got them too. But you aren't alone. And imposter syndrome is real. I show up on YouTube every day thinking about, Holy cow, who am I to talk about this? And then I remind myself, I've done this.

[00:30:22.090] - Speaker 1
I've grown YouTube channels. I know what I'm talking about. So if you've organized your refrigerator and you've kept it clean, you've done You're good enough to talk about this. Also, you do not have to make everybody happy. There are going to be people out there that are going to say, Well, that's not how to do it. That's not how I would do it. That is absolutely fine. We are not out there to make everybody happy. I just really want you to understand that you do know enough to be on video. You can show up. You are your own special unicorn. That's what that gift is there for. I just wanted to give you that pep talk because I understand how difficult sometimes it can be to show up on video, but you can do this. You can be you and still do well on video. I want you to write this in your notes right now. If you're taking any notes or put this on a post-it and stick it on your computer, stick it in your office, stick it on your mirror that you wake up to every morning. You are good enough to be the face of your business or your blog.

[00:31:24.880] - Speaker 1
You are good enough to show up as the writer, as the content creator. You are good enough, okay? Write that down. Say it every single day, say it multiple times a day. Trust me, you are good enough. So now here we go. We're moving into that repurposing strategy that you are so anxious to hear. And so here's what happens. You create that video for YouTube, which is your hub, and it shows up on YouTube, it shows up on Google. Amazing, right? So you create that YouTube video. You then put that video on Facebook because you edited that Facebook ending. You then maybe send that video out to a newsletter. If you have a newsletter, you then can transcribe that or flush out your script, and you have a blog post that you can embed a video to. Double the SEO juice for Google, right? Again, if you have funnels in place for your email system, you can use that video there. You can create video pins, and we have seen massive success with video pins in my own business. You can turn that first 15 15 seconds of your video into a video pin on Pinterest.

[00:32:34.760] - Speaker 1
You can share that video on Instagram, too. Look at that one video that's going to all these different places, right? This is your multiplying formula right here. So how is this going to be possible? Templates, templates, templates, my friends. Doing this first round is going to take you a little more time than doing the second round because you need to set up templates for your Facebook. You want to make sure it is dimensioned for Facebook. You want to make sure it looks native to Facebook, and you want to make sure it stands out on Facebook. So creating one Facebook template is all you got to do. And then you just constantly put that video on that template that you created the first time around. Then you're going to do the Same thing for IGTV. So every time you put that IGTV video up, even if you're shooting horizontally and not vertically, it still looks well on Instagram. Same with your stories, same with your pins, and same with YouTube thumbnails, which is really critical if you're going to people on YouTube to actually watch your video. This is what templates are going to look like.

[00:33:35.410] - Speaker 1
Your template for a YouTube thumbnail may look like this, and then your Facebook template may look like this because remember, Facebook likes square video, and square video really stands out on Facebook. Then you got your Instagram TV or your Instagram stories. And then you got your video pin that might look something like this. So these look like templates. Let's see what this looks like in my business so you can get a sense of how this really looks. So you'll see up in the corner, that is my thumbnail on YouTube. It's much more catchy. People are more likely to click on that. Then you see down below, is video content killing your business? That is my Facebook video, and I'm taking the transcript so that I have captions underneath. Then I have that Instagram story or Instagram TV there in the middle, this one right here. Then this is my video pin where this video actually plays. It's 15 seconds and it plays. Creating these templates allows you to do this. Then this video pin. Oh, no, it's not going to work for me. This video pin looks something like this. Give it a second here.

[00:34:41.000] - Speaker 1
I'm going to tell you a little secret. Obviously, you won't be able to hear it on Pinterest, but that's going to stand out on Pinterest, right? And maybe your IG TV or your Instagram stories look something like this when you post it to make it super easy to post.

[00:34:54.800] - Speaker 2
I'm going to tell you a little secret about video content.

[00:34:57.560] - Speaker 1
And again, this can all be Templated. All you need to do is change out the video, change out the text. Super easy to do. So let's break this down. How is this all working in a eight-hour time frame? Because remember, we're taking that time you're spending per week. Maybe you're spending five hours per week creating content. Time's that by four. That's 20 freaking hours, right? This is just eight hours a month. You're going to spend two hours researching four videos. You're going to take one hour to script those four videos. Remember, you You have to stay in these boundaries. You have to set boundaries on your time. Otherwise, it's going to expand to the amount of time you give it. You're going to take 2 hours to film those videos, so about 30 minutes for each video to film. Then you're going to take 4 hours to edit, plot them into templates, and then schedule them. And your content is done for the month. You're showing up on YouTube, you're showing up on your blog, Pinterest, Instagram, Facebook, all of the places. One video a week for an entire month. Maybe your content plan looks something like this.

[00:36:01.100] - Speaker 1
Monday, you do your YouTube video. Tuesday, you do your blog post. Wednesday, you email your newsletter if you have one. Thursday, you do a Facebook post. Friday, you post on Instagram. Saturday, you do an IGTV episode because listen, somebody is not following you on all of these places. Maybe your mom, maybe your best friend. But most people are not catching your content all the time. So putting the same piece of content on multiple platforms is totally okay because there's people that are hooked on Facebook may not be on YouTube. There's people who are on YouTube may not be on Pinterest. So creating one piece of content and repurposing it strategically across all the platforms gets you in front of more people, gets more traffic to your blog, and finally moves that needle forward in your business or blog. So you have got to stop running this hamster wheel of creating content for every single platform and get more strategic, okay? You need to actually get that space back in your life again to enjoy your life and stop doing what they say and creating constant content. Okay, so that was a lot. I know. Totally understand.

[00:37:07.800] - Speaker 1
I covered a lot. Who feels like this is totally doable? You can actually see you Getting your life back right now. Let me know in the comments if you're like, Holy cow, I think I can actually schedule a massage or a manicure next month once I get this process in place. Let's just recap again, if you want to scribble these notes down or take a screenshot. We first talked finding the right video ideas that will convert. Convert to affiliate clicks, convert to loyal followers to make you look more valuable to a brand. You learn how to create a month's worth of powerful video content in just eight hours. And you learn why you don't need to focus on just one social platform to be successful because somebody is not following you on all those platforms. And even if they are, they aren't catching that content every single time you post it, right? You learn how to use YouTube and Pinterest to get in front of your target audience super fast because these are search engines and these are so powerful for you. You also learn why you need to follow this video format to get the most out of your content because I want to make sure you're creating content that connects with the viewer and also gets them to take action, whatever that action is you want them to do.

[00:38:21.620] - Speaker 1
You saw that it doesn't take more time to create all this video content. In the end, it's probably saving you time, right? If you're spending 20 hours a month creating content, I just cut your content creation time in half so you can finally enjoy your life again and spend time with your family. Maybe you can take those Fridays off like I have last year and really enjoy that time off as well. But here's the thing. I'm not going to leave you high and dry here because I know this can be a huge task to undertake. I want to give you this video multiplier roadmap, which is going to show you how I create all of these and also gives you the dimensions to every single video. You can start creating those templates with the right dimensions and a bonus point. If you take... I don't want you to create new content, right? I want you to take one of your most popular blog posts or maybe your most engaging one that you got the most comments on and turn it into a video. You probably already have loads of blog posts in your library of content.

[00:39:20.140] - Speaker 1
Take your most popular blog post right now and turn it into a video. When you do and you upload it on YouTube and embed it into your blog post, send me the link to that blog. I will go watch it. I will give you feedback. I will help you figure this out because I don't want you to do it alone. I challenge you to see if once you add that video to that blog post, does it do even better? Does it jump to the top of Google search results? Does your video show up at the top of search results? So you have seven days, so one week, to send me the link to your video. And like I said, I will give you feedback to help you continue in this video creation process and multiplying your content. Okay, got it? So you can get this PDF at trinalittle. Com/vmf. And you can also email me that video at trina@trinalittle. I would love to give you feedback on it because I know what it's like to struggle and to spend time on content creation. I don't want anybody else to have to think they have to create constant content to be successful because it is so not true.

[00:40:29.990] - Speaker 1
So one thing I really, really want you to take away from this because look, I know you may be going out of your box here, out of your comfort zone and getting on video. You are good enough to be the face of your business or your blog. I know maybe you're just creating a blog, but your blog is your business. And look, you really need to show up as that leader on your blog to create those connections, to really get people to take action for you. Okay? I know it's tough, but I know you can do it. So remember to grab this as soon as possible. Send me that link within the next week so I can give you feedback on your video. And I cannot wait to see what this does for your schedule. And if you can finally get your life back and off that content creation hamster wheel.

[00:41:16.680] - Speaker 3
All right, Trina, thank you so much. I have a lot of work to do in my eight hours this month, but I'm excited to give this a go and get back to video, especially the other sessions we have in this summit. I'm like, I really want to get back to I enjoy it. So now that I feel like I have a way to accomplish that, thank you so much. You have a free offer for attendees. Can you tell us a little bit about it?

[00:41:39.310] - Speaker 2
Yeah, it's actually my video multiplier roadmap. And so in there, it takes you through every single piece of content that you can create with one video. This is really going to save a lot of your time in that content creation because you post a blog post, you want to get the word out in as many places as possible. So this is going to show you all the different places you can multiply that content to. And then what's really important, I'm giving you all the dimensions for all the video places. So the dimensions for stories, Instagram stories, Instagram TV, LinkedIn, Facebook, any video platform you can stick it on. I give you all the dimensions inside of there.

[00:42:16.080] - Speaker 3
Okay, awesome. Thank you guys. Definitely go grab that. The link and the information for that is below this video. I'm definitely going to go sign up because, like I said, I've been wanting to get back to video. So thank you, Trina, so much. Any just final words for anyone?

[00:42:29.520] - Speaker 1
Yeah, if you're wondering what your first step is, just create a video.

[00:42:35.930] - Speaker 2
I use the analogy getting on a bike. You're never going to be able to learn to ride that bike. If you don't just get on, there will be falls, bumps, and bruises. But you keep going at it, you'll get better at it, and you just got to start.

[00:42:49.280] - Speaker 3
All right. Yes. Thank you so much. I learned a lot today. I know everyone else did, too. Definitely go check out her site, guys.
