Liz Stapleton [00:00:00]:
Alright, Eric. Thank you so much for joining me for the session for the summit. I really appreciate it.

Eric Nisall [00:00:06]:
Thank you for inviting me.

Liz Stapleton [00:00:07]:
Yeah. Well, this is the second summit I've done. You were a speaker at my last one too, so I know you're a good one. So we're gonna be we're gonna do a little q and a style. We're gonna be talking about sort of the the business of blogging or blogging as a business. Right. So one thing we just touched on is a lot of people don't realize when they start a blog, it's potentially starting a business. Like, it could just be a hobby, but a lot of them, like, at the summit, chances are they're looking at it as a business?

Eric Nisall [00:00:36]:
Yeah. it's it's one of those things where even if you're not thinking about it, as a business to begin with, you're better off just starting out right on your on the right foot because at some point, you're gonna want to potentially create a full blown business out of it. Like, that's how a lot of your favorite bloggers have started. You know, they are blogging on the side. They do their own, like, you know, part time stuff or whatever to have fun with it, but at some point, they're like, oh my god, I'm getting money from ads, or I'm getting people, you know, asking me to do sponsored posts. Wow. And then you have to do this whole crap ton of work to turn it into a business afterwards because if you're doing it under your Social Security number on your schedule c, then you have to get your separate bank account in the middle of the year, let's say. And then it's like, okay. Yeah. Now I have to start doing all this stuff in mid year. And if if you're gonna do it yourself, you're gonna cause yourself a lot of headaches. If you have to pay an accountant to do it or, you know, somebody to do it is gonna be a a long process So you might as well just start off right from the beginning and treat it as a business. If you're treating it as a business from the beginning, then no matter what comes up as you know, get through the whole process, it's gonna turn out to be a lot easier to manage from forward.

Liz Stapleton [00:01:50]:
Yeah. The the the lesson I have learned the hard way for sure as I battle QuickBooks. And I've been at it for years, but it's still a battle. I, like, switched to QuickBooks online this year as opposed to QuickBooks Self Employed, and it's

Eric Nisall [00:02:02]:
Oh, yes. for anybody out there listening, do not start with QuickBooks Self Employed. I don't care if you make no money the self employed version is crap. It does not upgrade. Yeah.

Liz Stapleton [00:02:15]:
But doesn't give you nearly the amount of information you need as a business owner, for sure.

Eric Nisall [00:02:19]:
Well, just to briefly touch on it.

Liz Stapleton [00:02:22]:
there's -- -- is a mistake I made. Yeah.

Eric Nisall [00:02:25]:
There there's, like, three main reasons why I can't stand it. is it's not actually supported right quick. They're right into it. Like, the QuickBooks team does not actually have support staff work, so you can't call up and be like, hey, can you walk me through this thing? you know, it's only via email or something like that. the second thing is everything is locked in. You have preset income expenses categories, you can't create your own stuff. So if you are trying to customize your books to be your business, like, to fit your business, then you're gonna be screwed because you can only fit, you know, whatever they do. And the reporting sucks, but the biggest problem is when you're ready to upgrade, and you've out drawn the self employed version, you have to start totally from scratch because you cannot upgrade to a higher full version from it. And to me, that's the biggest piece of crap excuse or, you know, I don't even know what they call it. -- I know. It's just it makes no sense whatsoever for for anybody to use that software unless you

Liz Stapleton [00:03:23]:
are -- In my defence. It was nice that they just told me how much to submit for my quarterly taxes. But, no, I

Eric Nisall [00:03:31]:
don't think that that's accurate.

Liz Stapleton [00:03:33]:
In switching to QuickBooks online this year, because I I took, like, of course, to help me because I'm I like numbers. I I have a degree in mathematics, and I like money, but I am not good at, like, the accounting bookkeeping aspect of things. So I took, a beta core I was a beta member of the course this year and, like, being able to set up my chart of accounts and be so that I can see at a glance. Okay. How much affiliate income did I year? How much did I pay out for affiliates? How much did my products earn? How much did my services earn? How much did I make from ad revenue? Like, that was real that's really nice. Fighting my one, like, big problem with QuickBooks is Stripe, but, but, yeah, because because somehow right now, I've reconciled all my accounts, but there's, like, somehow duplicates, and there's, like, a $10,000 discrepancy between, which I'm like, I don't I think I know how it happens, but I don't know how to fix it. So I've gotta call next early January for me to figure that out with the cabin. but, no, but, like like you said, like setting up your own personal things so that you can see, okay, what you know, this is sort of the business side of blogging. Right? What income streams are doing well for you? What do you wanna double down on? What do you wanna try to make, you know, and improve on?

Eric Nisall [00:04:42]:
what you wanna quit putting time into because if you have a let's say you have, like, 5 websites that you maintaining and one of them just is a money pit. Yeah. You know, you're gonna wanna be able to see that and be like, okay. Yeah. Like, I'm not making any money off of this. and I keep putting in good money after bad money. And that's the, you know, people will tell you, there's a, you know, there's a phrase or whatever they call it, you know, don't throw good money after bad. Yeah. Basically, if you have a losing business, you're gonna you know, it's not gonna be any better by throwing money into it. You know? So that's why you need to be proactive and start treating everything the way, like, you know, treat it like a business. What was the worst that could happen? Yeah. There's there's really no downside to starting off as a full blown business as opposed to the other way around. you have to, you know, start changing everything and start applying for EINs and starting to incorporate that year and do all that other crap. Yeah.

Liz Stapleton [00:05:40]:
And let I mean, I mean, there's a cost too. Right? But EIN's free to get. Okay. How much in you know, if you're gonna go the LLC route, which we'll touch on a little bit later, that's gonna vary widely depending on where you're located. It could be -- Yeah. -- $30 to $500. So that just depends, you know, a quickbooks, you know, subscription fee is, what, 30 bucks a month depending on what -- Depending

Eric Nisall [00:06:03]:
on who you know.

Liz Stapleton [00:06:04]:
Yes. Depending on who you know.

Eric Nisall [00:06:05]:
A pro advisor, you know, who holds the subscription for you or creates it for you, making it 50% off. unless you deal with and I dealt with these people before, my quote, quote, sales adviser with, my proadvisor side, they're like, oh, we're offering 5 to 5, like, 5 the luxe version or whatever it was for $5. And you could go pay $5 for an in charge of clients, $50, the full price of like, I'm not a douchebag. I'm not gonna make money off my clients that way.

Liz Stapleton [00:06:37]:
Yeah. Yeah.

Eric Nisall [00:06:38]:
So, you know, you have to know who you're dealing with, but, there are there are gonna be cost to everything. Yeah. A lot of times, the cost is gonna be worth it.

Liz Stapleton [00:06:47]:
Yeah. And it's one of those things that if you're if you invest in it that way, you're more likely to take it serious as Yeah. so that you're gonna generate revenue probably faster just as the motivation and mindset you're using. Absolutely. Yeah. So So when you're starting out, you know, look at those things, but set up, like you said, a a strong bookkeeping system.

Eric Nisall [00:07:08]:
I mean, I'm personally I'm not, you know, married to anyone, you know, thing. Yeah. Obviously, FreshBooks is not a real accounting program. They don't give you the bank reconciliations. They don't let you track assets and stuff like that. Yeah. So I mean, don't don't don't quote that. But if you're used to using a spreadsheet, use a spreadsheet.

Liz Stapleton [00:07:28]:
That's fine too.

Eric Nisall [00:07:29]:
Yeah. Whatever's gonna keep you engaged and tracking your money, that's really what you need to use. You know?

Liz Stapleton [00:07:37]:
That way you can, you know, see your deductions and figure out your taxes and all that stuff. because I've also been guilty of not reconciling for 6 months which is also bad news? I know. I know. I am, like, I am, like, the prime example of what not to do. but I'm working on it, and I'm getting better. It's a process, but I also didn't start right. Like, you're suggesting. So

Eric Nisall [00:08:00]:
you didn't have the summit to, you know, set you up on it like that.

Liz Stapleton [00:08:03]:
Exactly. Exactly. So I'm trying to help others where I failed.

Eric Nisall [00:08:06]:
Yeah. Exactly.

Liz Stapleton [00:08:07]:
you know, another thing that's important when you're starting out, which I actually did do, very proud of, is separate bank accounts because --

Eric Nisall [00:08:15]:
Yes.

Liz Stapleton [00:07:59]:
-- I didn't necessarily have a business account for the 1st couple of years, but I had a specific credit card I used just for blogging stuff. I had a specific, I have multiple checking accounts under the personal finance space. I just, you know, specific checking account for stuff. So separate bank accounts can really help you in kind of keeping that separate and having that mindset as well. So how how would you suggest, you know, how many separate bank accounts do you need? What would you suggest in that front?

Eric Nisall [00:08:42]:
I believe in simplicity. So you have one bank account for your checking, you know, your actual transactions. And then if you need 1, have a savings account, you know, for, like, emergency funds, because even a business needs an emergency fund. You know, if you get sick, and you are running your own business, you don't get PTO paid time off. You don't get sick days. You don't get holidays. Any of that other stuff. So you need to have, you know, a backlog to pay your, you know, if you're if you're doing the escrow up salary, you wanna have a, an emergency fund to maintain your salary if you have an office that you work out of, you know, like a coworking space or whatever because you can't work at home, shift kids running around and stuff like that. you wanna be able to have money to pay your coworking space. And, you know, all that other stuff. So, you know, one checking account, one savings account. I can't stand people to have, like, 15,000 accounts and they transfer, you know, money back and forth, like, 8000 times a a month because that creates more confusion. And you know, the more accounts and the more transaction you have, the more work that goes into it. So in reality, if you have one checking account and one credit card, for your business. Yeah. You would think, oh, well, I have one for personal, one for business. It's gonna be twice to work. It's really not because when you're separating it, you're eliminating the need to take the time and go line by line by line. Like, if you have a if you have 2 different, you know, if one business, one personal, everything in here is business, everything here is personal. You don't have to go and do the, you know, through the, the line breakouts and say, okay. What was this? What was that? What was the other thing? And you're less likely to take something that doesn't belong in the business. Yeah. And you're also less likely to forget something that should be in the business, but you left on the personal side. Yeah. So by having everything in one account, you you it's all simple because, hey, guess what? The only thing that's in here is business stuff.

Liz Stapleton [00:10:36]:
Yeah. Can I ask your opinion on PayPal as an account as well? So I have a business checking you know, like, obviously, I I do think, but I know because so many online businesses, you use PayPal and get paid, and it's sometimes just easier to pay out of it too. So what are your thoughts on, like, okay. You have a checking account. You have credit card, and then you got PayPal that should do you believe PayPal should just be like a pass through or

Eric Nisall [00:10:59]:
I hate PayPal. I wish somebody would kill it. for several reasons. Okay. Number 1, it's when if you ever look at your bank statement, your credit card statement, the transactions that come through there, they don't give you any real information Like, when you sign up for a regular merchant account, you put your name of your business, the phone number of the business, it's recorded on that stuff. I don't know why quick, quickbooks on PayPal, why it doesn't make you put an actual, like, from your w 9 or whatever they collect your information from, use that as the name of the event, you know, the vendor and stuff. Yeah. you know, so that's a pain. another thing is it's not an actual bank account. You know, I don't I I know for a fact there's no FDIC insurance. There's no anything in there. So if anything happens, you know, you have their security, they they claim that they protect you with or whatever. Yeah. But it's not FDIC insured. you know, that's that's a big thing.

Liz Stapleton [00:11:52]:
That best of a pass through kind of a task.

Eric Nisall [00:11:55]:
Yeah. When you get it, I mean, I I don't I don't tell people to do it every day, but at least at the end of every week, you know, transfer everything over clear out the account. Use it as a clearing account because, you know, I don't like it, but I also am of the belief that you should make it impossible for people to not pay you. So take PayPal, take credit cards, take, you know, checks, take cash, you know, all that stuff. The only thing I understand people not liking it, and I won't ever do it is Bitcoin because not only is it, you know, very, very shady, but If you lose your, your wallet password, there's no recovery for that. It's not like going to your bank and saying, I forgot my password. Can you, you know, send me my, challenge questions or whatever. Yeah.

Liz Stapleton [00:12:37]:
I don't think I've ever considered that at all. I've never had anyone ask to do that either. And I feel like the only exception in terms of Paypal not being clearing account is a lot of affiliate programs only allow you to pay out your affiliates with PayPal.

Eric Nisall [00:12:51]:
Yeah. you just try

Liz Stapleton [00:12:53]:
to keep enough in there that I'll always be able to, like, just do my affiliate payments at the beginning of the month?

Eric Nisall [00:12:57]:
Yeah. Sometimes you have to, unfortunately, but you know, it's it's like I said, you know, it's this is necessary evil.

Liz Stapleton [00:13:05]:
Yeah.

Eric Nisall [00:13:06]:
But you should never use that as a as a main checking or, you know, save an account or anything like that. always taking money out. Leave a little bit in there in case you because here's what here's what happens with a lot of people. They spend, you know, they'll buy something through PayPal guess what? You have money in there. They forget, oh, crap. It came from my balance.

Liz Stapleton [00:13:24]:
Uh-huh.

Eric Nisall [00:13:25]:
Now if you're not paying an account to do your, you know, to do your books in every month, do you know how to account for that stuff? Do you know how you're gonna track? you know, here's your income. Here's stuff that came out of your balance. then here's what you took out and everything. How do you how do you reconcile all that stuff on your books? It's it's difficult thing.

Liz Stapleton [00:13:43]:
Yeah. It's a whole another skill set to learn. sort of accounting bookkeeping side of things. Yeah. But let's kind of take a step back for a second because we've we've thrown out LLC. We've thrown out S Corp. and I feel like those are not commonly understood. LLC is a limited liability company, and it is based by state kind of what's involved there. and the reason you would do it is to protect your personal assets. it's it's to limit your liability. It's literally in the name. but an s corp, that's a whole another ball game. And then -- Yes. the taxes and accounting side of those different things. Let's because because when it comes to choosing a business entity, which is what these are LLCs and S corps, There's a legal side to it, yes, which we have that covered in the summit in other sessions, but there's an accounting side to it as well. So can you kind of break those down and explain what they are and what they mean in terms of the the financial side of blogging and business.

Eric Nisall [00:14:41]:
Yeah. Absolutely. first things first, never ask your accountant if you should do the LLC versus remaining as a sole proprietor because for accounting tax, you know, tracking purposes, they're exactly the same thing. a single member LLC, meaning one person on the LLC is treated as a, sole proprietor for federal tax purposes. there is no special form that it gets filed on. So anybody that tells you, you need to make x amount of money before you, you know, through the LLC, they don't know what they're talking about. You know, as long as you have an asset, talk to a lawyer, make sure that what form of business it is, then the other thing that you wanna make sure, I mean, you're, 99.99% sure that you're gonna cover it. And the other thing is what you wanna do in the future, because it's not just about protecting your assets. If you want to sell your business later on, it's gonna be a lot easier to maybe do it as a corporation where you could just sell shares and then have somebody buy, you know, or, you know, just sell your shares or have somebody come in buy shares and then eventually you transition apps up like that. you know, that's something that a lot of people don't think about, you know, being a sole proprietor, it's tied to you. Once you stop doing the business, the business is essentially dead. You can sell your book of clients, you can sell your website or whatever, but the business as it is, is only entitled, you know, it's only for you to deal with. so whenever anybody asks asks the difference between a single member LLC and sole proprietor, only legal protections. There is no tax. I do. Yeah. There's no preference tax preference whatsoever.

Liz Stapleton [00:16:23]:
And correct me if I'm wrong, but as an LLC, you can choose to be taxed as a corporation.

Eric Nisall [00:16:29]:
Yes. You could choose to be taxed as a corporation and then, you know, the S Corp, which is the small business corporation, That's only available to US citizens. You cannot have any, any shareholders who are not US citizens. you can only have 75 shareholders. So if you're gonna be somebody that wants to lock the Silicon Valley and, you know, have, like, you know, a 1000 investors coming in, you cannot be an S Corp. it's literally for small businesses. The purpose of that is to assess the payer cell payroll. because as a sole proprietor, you cannot pay your self payroll. As a single member, LLC, you cannot pay your self payroll. You have to be a you know, as for all intents and purposes, a corporation.

Liz Stapleton [00:17:10]:
Yeah. It's not in ... financially, if you aren't doing it. Yeah.

Eric Nisall [00:17:15]:
Yeah. So that gives you some benefits which, you know, you wanna consider at different points when you're making, you know, certain amounts of money. If you're making $5000 profit, you don't wanna do the s corp, for financial purposes, because the cost is gonna outweigh the benefits. Yeah. You know, you have to pay for a separate tax return most of the time because at least on the federal level, you have a separate tax return. when you do payroll, you have federal and state, unemployment taxes in some states, depending on how many people you're gonna employ, if you're gonna employ yourself and your wife and your, you know, a woman person, you might have to have, Workers Comp Insurance. That's the one I'm looking for. you know, if it's only the person who is the shareholder employee, you can opt out of it. But once you have more than one person who's not the shareholder employee, that's another level of it, expense. you have to have a payroll tax, you have to have a payroll service, you know, there's a lot of admin stuff.

Liz Stapleton [00:18:16]:
Yeah. So at what point does going that route become worth it?

Eric Nisall [00:18:21]:
I have 4 different things where I tell people. one is the monetary reason when you wanna save on your self employment taxes by having some of your money paid to you in the form of a distribution versus the salary. that's about, like, you know, maybe 30, $40,000 depending on who's filing the returns for you and all that stuff. I've had people who they would save about $2,000

Eric Nisall [00:18:44]:
in taxes by doing the S Corp. Yeah. But it would cost them maybe $1200 between the the tax returns, the additional taxes, the payroll loan, the stuff. They didn't find that it was worth it to save $800 net. Yeah. And some people, you know, some people, like, if I could save a petty, it's worth it. Some people are like, if I have to save, you know, at least x amount, they'll be worth it. But there's not monetary reasons. One of them is if you are a renter or if you need financing, you would want to do the s corp because that is a lot easier to show income. That's why a lot of people you'll see in a lot of Facebook groups or in, any kind of, like, you know, stuff, it's like self employment circles. They'll say, the best bank to go to for a self employed person to get a loan for a house because they want all this, you know, they wanna crack ton of stuff. They want, like, you know, 50 months of, statements from your business and your personal side. They want, like, 4 years of tax returns. When you're doing the payroll for yourself, you have a w 2 and you have a pay stub. So you can show them, you know, your last three pay stubs and your w 2 from the last year plus your last year's tax return and it simplifies the process. another thing that people have to realize is by not taking salary, you are shorting yourself on your contributions to Social Security. So if you're the type of person that says, I want to maximize every method of retirement income that I have, you're not gonna wanna cut, you know, cut your nose off despite your face by taking less of a salary to save 12% or whatever it comes to for the self employment taxes. Yeah. And then you have another side where if you make a lot a lot of money and you have to take a significantly high salary, you're automatically gonna stop getting a social security taxes anyway at this 2019 is like 138,000 -139,000 or something like that. So if you're a $1,000,000 business and you have to take, like, a $3,000-$4,000 salary

Liz Stapleton [00:20:35]:
-- Take your business or a $100,000, is this?

Eric Nisall [00:20:40]:
Yeah. You're not saving. You you the possibility of you pricing yourself out of the savings by doing the, you know, oh, I'm gonna take some pay in distributions because it's not passed for Social Security and Medicare. You're pressing yourself out of that. Yeah. So it's gonna be a case by case basis. You know, what you prefer in terms of, you know, structure? Do you wanna go through all these groups and set up all these administrative stuff? you wanna have the w 2 for later on to, you know, for, you know, financing a new car or buying a house, even for renting, you know, If you could show them just, you know, your last three pay stubs or whatever that shows steady earnings, it's a lot easier to show them all the documentation. So it's a case by case basis.

Liz Stapleton [00:21:19]:
Yeah. When we're talking about renting, we're not necessarily talking about, like, renting an office, talking about

Eric Nisall [00:21:23]:
if you -- No. No. Renting an office.

Liz Stapleton [00:21:25]:
You know? Yes.

Eric Nisall [00:21:26]:
I'll -- When

Liz Stapleton [00:21:26]:
you when you do a rental application, they ask for your income because they wanna make sure they're rental and they can afford it. So, yeah, no. I just I just wanna clarify that. Right.

Eric Nisall [00:21:36]:
Yeah. So, basically, if there's more than just monetary, you know, income tax purposes for the escrow, you wanna know all there is to it. And and most people don't talk about that stuff. Most people don't go online. I'll be like, hey. I'm saving because I'm not taking all my money. You know, it's it's not all taxed to me. like, when I'm a sole proprietor on my Schedule C, I'm taking some of it as a distribution, which is only taxed at federal and state levels.

Liz Stapleton [00:22:00]:
Yeah.

Eric Nisall [00:22:00]:
And that's another thing you have to realize. Yeah. Just because somebody's saving money, they're you're not gonna save the same amount of money because you could be in a different state, and different states treat as S Corps differently.

Liz Stapleton [00:22:10]:
Yeah.

Eric Nisall [00:22:10]:
Some of them tax them at a corporate tax rate. That's an actual taxable entity. So, you know, everybody has to look at

Liz Stapleton [00:22:18]:
it. pay attention to what state you're in. And most cases, you can find out that information on the secretary of state's website or your specific state in the corporation section.

Eric Nisall [00:22:27]:
best thing to do. Make an appointment with an accountant. It could be a tax accountant. It could be a tax attorney. Just somebody who's gonna be able to explain the things to you. because,

Liz Stapleton [00:22:37]:
you know, not everybody's gonna be -- -- state secrtary's website state website.

Eric Nisall [00:22:42]:
Oh, yes. So then

Liz Stapleton [00:22:43]:
-- And you're like, okay. Got this. Oh, there's your, like, what?

Eric Nisall [00:22:46]:
Yes. some of them.

Liz Stapleton [00:22:47]:
I moved to Washington this year, and I'm like, I've been trying to do quarterly taxes. I'm pretty sure I've done them completely wrong because I'm like, I don't understand what this is. Like, in North Carolina, you just send them a check. They're like, take this percent and give it to us. You're like, done. Washington is before you get it. I'm like, what?

Eric Nisall [00:23:03]:
I said states a very good example of things that people don't realize. You look at those those list of states that don't charge, you know, income taxes. Washington State does not have an income tax.

Liz Stapleton [00:23:14]:
Yeah.

Eric Nisall [00:23:14]:
But you have a gross receipts tax.

Liz Stapleton [00:23:16]:
Yeah.

Eric Nisall [00:23:17]:
So, you know, people don't always talk about that stuff when they're, you know, throwing out their information because they read a book or, you know, they did their own taxes 1 year with, you know, TurboTax or something like that. you know, and that's another thing that we really need to be careful of is know who you're taking advice from, you know, just because somebody is chatting in a Facebook group, doesn't mean they know what the hell they're talking about. You know, just because somebody's an accountant, doesn't mean that they know that they're talking about. somebody who's an accountant in a, private business, corporate accounting is not the same as public accounting. Mhmm.

Eric Nisall [00:23:02]:
two totally different things.

Liz Stapleton [00:23:54]:
Yeah.

Eric Nisall [00:23:55]:
you know, somebody who is even somebody who's a CPA, somebody who's a CPA, they could be specializing in auditing not know the damn distinct about income taxes, and say that I could an attorney, you could have a divorce attorney. You're not gonna go to them to draw up a business contract.

Liz Stapleton [00:24:09]:
Yeah. Everyone put their area special specialization, and you also need to look at location too. so --

Eric Nisall [00:24:15]:
It's it's very important.

Liz Stapleton [00:24:17]:
Yes. okay. So I do just wanna touch on so we've talked about when you start out or if you've already started. take the steps to do it now. It's always easier to do it now than when you really have to. you know, get an EIN, which is easy to do from federal government, decide if, you know, what sort of business entity you wanna be file it with the state, which, you know, you can do with an attorney. You could do yourself. It's usually actually not that hard to yourself?

Eric Nisall [00:24:44]:
No. Not with the not with the single person. If you're just putting a single LLC,

Liz Stapleton [00:23:53]:
like, when a friend told me they paid $800 to an attorney do that, and they're state. like, filing fees was $30. I was like -- Yeah. -- because when I worked at a law firm as a law student, like, the client got charged $80 an hour for me to figure out end of well, it's not figure out, but how to file it. You know? And I'm like, I didn't know when I've, you know, I had to figure it out, and then they got charged for the time it took for me to file it, which is really Yeah.

Eric Nisall [00:25:13]:
Yeah. It's not a good thing.

Liz Stapleton [00:25:15]:
It's really not that hard to file a single member LLC. Look at your secretary's state's website. They usually have pretty good instructions.

Eric Nisall [00:25:24]:
I just wanna throw one thing in there.

Liz Stapleton [00:25:26]:
Yeah.

Eric Nisall [00:25:27]:
If you do not feel secure enough to do it yourself, Yeah. Pay somebody to do it, but don't let them do your EIN for you. Yeah. The EIN is 5 minutes, and it's free. I have an article that I wrote about doing it yourself, like, with the LLC and all that stuff. And I'm not gonna name the company. 1 of the, what do you call them? The the formation companies out there. Yeah. they charged

Eric Nisall [00:25:11]:
$70, $79 for an EIN, When you prorate that 12, you know, it takes you 5 minutes to do it. Maybe 15 minutes.

Liz Stapleton [00:26:00]:
You have to look up some stuff.

Eric Nisall [00:26:02]:
Okay. Let's let's say

Eric Nisall [00:26:04]:
15 minutes. four four times

Eric Nisall [00:26:05]:
25 to get to 60 minutes is so it's four times the amount that you spend to get to the hourly rate.

Liz Stapleton [00:26:12]:
Yeah.

Eric Nisall [00:26:12]:
They charge you $80 charging you

Liz Stapleton [00:26:14]:
$320

Eric Nisall [00:26:15]:
an hour to file an EIN, which costs you nothing.

Liz Stapleton [00:26:19]:
Yeah. And yourself. Yeah. So do the EIN yourself, for sure.

Eric Nisall [00:26:22]:
Absolutely. At the very least.

Liz Stapleton [00:26:24]:
At the very least, you use separate accounts. You don't necessarily have to be business accounts if you're not a business entity yet. Right. -- once you become a business entity, you can open a business account. You are gonna have to show that state filing to do that.

Eric Nisall [00:26:37]:
There is something that a lot of people are confused with the EINs also. Okay. if you look at the w

Liz Stapleton [00:26:43]:
9 -- By the way, it stands for employment. I didn't. It's a --

Eric Nisall [00:26:46]:
Employer identification.

Liz Stapleton [00:26:43]:
Business version of a Social Security number because since we name it. Yes. Yes.

Eric Nisall [00:26:51]:
there's something that a lot of people are confused about. If you look at the instructions for the w nine, which is the form that you fill out as a business to, you know, to show what your, basically to for the other company to give you a 1099

Eric Nisall [00:27:08]:
You're telling them what your business name is, what your social security number is, all that stuff.

Liz Stapleton [00:27:12]:
Yeah. You'd like to build it out for, like, Google AdSense. for for affiliate income, things like that without realizing it. But, yeah.

Eric Nisall [00:27:21]:
you the EIN is nothing for you. If you look at the instructions for that section, it says specifically, if you are a disregarded entity, which is in single member LLC, use the Social Security number of the owner or if the owner has an EIN, use that. but the EIN for the business, you only need an EIN for the business for the bank. And in tax purposes, you only need it for having a payroll account If you're gonna do payroll or, for, you know, the majority of people, a retirement account. Other than that, the EIN does nothing for So if you wanna just protect your Social Security number, get the EIN under your personal name, and then you can use that. to protect your your yourself that way. But don't give them the EIN of the name.

Liz Stapleton [00:28:11]:
EIN for free. You can do it under your personal name and work with

Eric Nisall [00:27:07]:
the business. Right. But, you know, a lot of people are like, oh, I'm gonna put my personal, my business EIN on the w nine so that I'm protecting my my Social Security number. if that goes if they use the, the auto tin check or whatever they call it with the IRS, it's gonna fail. Yeah. Because when you file your taxes on your schedule c, if you look at the top of the form, it has your name and your, your personal social security number. And if you look at it, it also tells you, don't put an EIN here unless you have payroll or, a retirement account or, like, some which we stopped. We're we're stopped.

Liz Stapleton [00:28:48]:
Yeah. Okay. But so -- Yeah. So we

Eric Nisall [00:28:50]:
need to be careful with. Yes.

Liz Stapleton [00:28:51]:
Separate accounts to keep track of the expenses have, even as a beginner, you know, you're hosting your domain, what your whatever email marketing service you're using, keep that separate. It makes life a lot easier.

Eric Nisall [00:29:02]:
and that's all legitimately deductible in the beginning. Like, you can have a loss. You can definitely have a loss in the 1st year of business. You're expected to have a loss. Yeah. If it's legitimate stuff, right, the stuff that list you said, you know, you're hosting, your domain registration, bank fees, you know, you're

Liz Stapleton [00:29:21]:
-- -- to get your business, you know, help me think.

Eric Nisall [00:29:25]:
Yes. email marketing. Anything that's ordinary and necessary to run your business is a deductible expense that should be run through the business accounts.

Liz Stapleton [00:28:47]:
And admittedly it can be a little confusing because, you know, government has not caught up with the times. And in a sense, running an online business is a little bit of the Wild Wild West. If you're like, what do I categorize this expense? So that can be a tad confusing, but there is a lot of resources out there to help you figure it out.

Eric Nisall [00:29:52]:
And that's that's also why you also need to, if you're gonna be hiring an accountant

Liz Stapleton [00:29:57]:
--

Eric Nisall [00:29:57]:
Yeah. -- interview them. Don't hire somebody just because they're your family accountant. Don't hire them just because

Liz Stapleton [00:30:02]:
somebody folder. Yeah. Like, so, like, Eric is someone who, you know, like, his primary business is working with online entrepreneurs, and so he really knows his stuff there.

Eric Nisall [00:30:12]:
Yeah. A lot of people, you know, that quote unquote traditional people. you know, those are the people that still send out a

Liz Stapleton [00:30:19]:
1099

Eric Nisall [00:30:20]:
when their clients paid the contractors with a credit card, even though in the instructions for the 1099 miscellaneous form, it says Do not file the 1099 if you paid with a paid with a credit card or paid through a PSC payment settlement entity, like PayPal or Stripe or Square or any of those other things because the reporting entity is going the payment entity is going to report that on the 1099 k not you on the 1099 miscellaneous, and we are not the tax police. We don't say, well, I'm gonna send this just in case because I'm not short if they're gonna qualify for 1099 k. Yeah. That's not your decision. Yeah. Your decision is did I pay them with cash or check? set them at 1099 or Venmo or, you know, Zelle, something like that.

Liz Stapleton [00:31:07]:
Yeah. I pay them

Eric Nisall [00:31:07]:
with a credit card or a debit card or PayPal. don't send it. That's why you have to decide. Yeah. That is simple.

Liz Stapleton [00:31:14]:
Yeah. And so that's all, like, the startup stuff when you're kind of looking at your blog as a business. And then ongoing is sort of keeping up with that bookkeeping and reconciling and stuff where you might hire a bookkeeper, you might do it yourself. I'll be honest, like, I cannot wait to hire out my bookkeeping. I'm like, the first thing to go because I hate it, and I'm not very good. And I always have to do, like, I always have to pay someone to help me fix it.

Eric Nisall [00:31:42]:
Oh, well, that happens.

Liz Stapleton [00:31:44]:
Yeah. Yeah. So So if you're gonna look at it as a business, don't just look at it as a business when you start and get all these things in place. Make sure you're keeping up with it. month to month. Yes. You know, yes. Doing, you know, check-in once or twice a month, be like, hey. Is everything lining up? Do a reconciliation?

Eric Nisall [00:32:03]:
the reconciliations are very important because I have clients that I've found that the banks did not push the transactions down. you know, for sometimes it was like a week. Yeah. you know.

Liz Stapleton [00:32:15]:
Well, you see that with Stripe, especially because there's always a 7 day lag period.

Eric Nisall [00:32:19]:
Yeah. That's for matching things up, but I'm talking about actual transaction that never came down. Yes. the APIs that the banks and the credit cards used, you know, it's on the bank side. It's nothing to do with QuickBooks or FreshBooks or any of those other companies. It's always on the bank side. Yeah. So sometimes you have an outage and a week's worth of transactions will get pushed down, and you're not gonna know that if you're not doing the reconciliations. Yeah. The reconciliation only takes about 5 minutes. You know?

Liz Stapleton [00:32:44]:
Held depends on how long you've gone without. And if something's messed up, if you know what you're doing, it takes about 5 minutes.

Eric Nisall [00:32:52]:
If everything has been done properly, like, throughout the whole month and, you know, in the past, then yes. If you're doing it month to month, it only takes 5 minutes. It should only take 5 minutes.

Liz Stapleton [00:33:02]:
Okay. I feel like a professional 5 minutes, someone else, 15. It also depends on how many transactions you have.

Eric Nisall [00:33:09]:
Yes.

Liz Stapleton [00:33:09]:
That makes a difference too.

Eric Nisall [00:33:11]:
Yeah. I mean, if you're a sales if you sell crap and you have, like, you know, 500 contacts

Liz Stapleton [00:29:50]:
-- These are quality bloggers, sir. They are not selling crap. They're selling fantastic digital product. Excuse you. Know you're an audience, sir. But, yeah, so if you're selling digital products and you make a lot of sales, yeah, so that you're gonna have a

Eric Nisall [00:33:33]:
lot going on. Yes. Yes.

Liz Stapleton [00:33:35]:
But, yeah, any anything else final words in terms of, you know, blogging as a business that people should know, whether they just started a blog recently, or they've been at it a while? Or --

Eric Nisall [00:33:32]:
Number one thing that I tell people in just with anything, personal finance, business, Do what works for you. Don't look at what somebody else is doing and and, you know, spouting off amount. Don't look at, you know, especially if you're just starting out, don't look at somebody who's been, you know, has a blog or who's been a a freelance writer or whatever for 5 years already. You know, don't look at them in terms of know, what they're doing now because a lot of what they're doing is only because they're at a point monetarily. You know? Yeah. I would not recommend going straight to QuickBooks or an accountant or if like that when you're first starting out to, you know, unless you are the type of person, where you had all this money saved up specifically for those items. You know, like, when I first started my business, I started up with $17,000 in savings. Business savings. Yeah. Because I knew that I only had one client and, you know, I might have to, you know, pay out the savings.

Liz Stapleton [00:34:43]:
Yeah.

Eric Nisall [00:34:44]:
if you're the type of person who is collecting a very, very detail oriented and you plan for everything and you said, okay. I have x amount of money put away so that I could pay somebody to do my accounting so that they could do this blah blah blah. That that's fine. if you get somebody who's like me and who has models and ethics and you only have, like, 5 transactions a month, they're gonna tell you, you don't belong paying me anyway. You know, it's a spreadsheet for now. once you reach, like, a viable amount of transactions, then call me and, you know, we'll talk about it because there's no reason to pay somebody to do, like, you know, 5 transactions a month. And especially in blogging, you don't have a lot of overhead in the beginning because you're doing everything annual. Most of the time, your domain registration is annual. Your hosting is annual. if, you know, because you're saving money,

Liz Stapleton [00:35:32]:
Yeah. It it stays right, but sometimes you aren't, you know, because you can't afford that annual fee, in which case you might

Eric Nisall [00:35:37]:
have to

Liz Stapleton [00:34:42]:
pay email marketing or tailwind or you know, deadline funnel, canva, you know, things can whatever. You know?

Eric Nisall [00:35:48]:
Yeah. The the the normal the normal price stuff.

Liz Stapleton [00:35:46]:
But I feel like those kind of as you get into different levels of blogging is when you kind of reach those. Right? So, like -- Yeah. maybe you can get away with the free canva account for a long time. --

Eric Nisall [00:36:00]:
I still use a free account.

Liz Stapleton [00:36:02]:
Yeah. I actually I did paid for a long time, and then I actually switched. I use Google slides pretty much for all my graphics now. I love it. I was able to systemize it, so I, like, click a button and it makes 5 pins for me. But, Yeah. So, you know, but now I pay for a Podia. Podia for to sell my digital products because it just it's easier. It does a bunch of stuff for me. It does. Right. Yeah. So but I didn't have to pay for that my 1st, you know, year or 2 or whatever.

Eric Nisall [00:36:30]:
No. Do use free options. but they're they're free

Liz Stapleton [00:36:33]:
from -- There are. There's free or cheaper options available where, okay, maybe it's free up front when they take a portion of your sales or something. You know? So there are ways you can bootstrap it. Yeah. You know, until you're you're reaching a certain income level that you're like, okay. No. I wanna keep that fee, you know, or whatever, or or it's worth it to me to keep that fee because I'm paying out warranties than I would for the monthly subscription. You know? So so you gotta kinda look at that. And and I'd say at least quarterly, you know, review those expenses and see which ones are actually necessary, which ones you can change, or cheapen, or if you can now afford the annual subscription to upgrade and save that.

Eric Nisall [00:37:09]:
Yeah. Because, you know, it's the same thing as, like, outsourcing, you know, at a certain point, you're gonna be able to afford to, you know, certain luxuries in the business world. And you you just have to look at it and say, is my time better off served creating and selling or producing whatever, you know, if you're blogging and you're writing whatever you're

Liz Stapleton [00:37:30]:
good at, then it is to --

Eric Nisall [00:37:32]:
Or whatever it's phrasing

Liz Stapleton [00:37:34]:
the money. -- or do something that you're like, hey. This is easy enough to do someone else can do it for less than what it costs me in my time.

Eric Nisall [00:37:41]:
Yeah. Like, one of the prime examples that I use is if you're a writer, if you get paid, $300 for an article, and it takes you half an hour to write an article. And you can write 2 of them for $600 in 1 hour you're gonna pay a hell of a lot less than $600 for somebody to do your books for you you know, whereas your your trip is $600. Or what I

Liz Stapleton [00:38:06]:
--

Eric Nisall [00:38:06]:
Yeah. Something. You know, just something. You have to look at when when you reach that point. that you bring in money regularly. You have to look at and say, when is it time for me to hand this off to somebody else? Of course, a, they could do it more efficiently.

Liz Stapleton [00:38:21]:
Yep. And b -- -- warehouse. -- more effectively. Yeah.

Eric Nisall [00:38:24]:
And then I can spend my time making money.

Liz Stapleton [00:38:28]:
Yeah.

Eric Nisall [00:37:08]:
And the money that I make is probably gonna be multiples of what it would cost me to off load stuff to people. Exactly. you know, so like I said, you just don't look at what other people are doing if they're not in, you know, the same time frame as you are. Somebody who's been doing this for 10 years, who makes, you know, 7 figures a year is gonna be able to do things that you cannot do. Unless I'm always

Liz Stapleton [00:38:53]:
and and take it with the grain of salt because there could be people earning 6 figures. You know, they're earning a $100,000, but they're spending 99,000 on ads. You know? So, like, take everything as a grain of salt there. Okay? Like, don't don't play the compare game too much. Mhmm. And, also, look at the date. So this is where, like, I think the keeping any accounting and taking it as a business seriously really matters is don't just look at the balance of your checking account to make decisions on what you can afford. you know, knowing kind of, you know, how much are you earning from this? How much can you expect to earn in the next couple of months? What does this look like? really makes a difference in in choosing what -- Yeah. -- luxuries you can do if you if you will.

Eric Nisall [00:39:33]:
Lex, a lot of a lot of income is not repeatable. Yep. You know, I'm I I've learned the hard work. Like, this is the 1st year that I've had, ads on my blog. And for, like, you know, I started in February. So for the 1st, like, 4 ,4 months, 5 months, it was like, you know, I'd be lucky if I was getting, like, $10 a day.

Liz Stapleton [00:39:55]:
Yeah.

Eric Nisall [00:39:55]:
So my monthly was, like, 200, 250 a month for the 1st 6 months or so.

Liz Stapleton [00:40:00]:
Yeah. And then

Eric Nisall [00:39:54]:
all of a sudden, 3 months ago, it spiked up to $2700. Yeah. And then 2 months ago, it was

Liz Stapleton [00:40:07]:
$1700.

Eric Nisall [00:40:09]:
And now this month is gonna be $1200. So, you know, that big spike is not repeatable because, you know, I'm putting I was I'm not putting all my eggs in one basket, but if you're looking at it in that regard, You know?

Liz Stapleton [00:40:23]:
But that's the thing to keep in mind if blogging is is none of your income is def is necessarily guaranteed. No. Right. There's oh, you earn an affiliate commission, but it's pending until the refund period's passed, and they might refund. You know? and so that you do have to kind of be comfortable with that kind of risk, but you also have you know, if you have the data of, like, okay. Well, I've consistently made this even with returns or what. You can kind of, like, have a better idea of what that's gonna bring in, which gives you sort of that comfort. And another reason why you need to have savings, like, is saving a portion every month. Yes. not just pay taxes, but an actual savings account, that will help you, you know, kind of whether those inconsistent months or when something does fall through.

Eric Nisall [00:41:03]:
Yeah. And, you know, it's That's where the that's one of these the small little times when it's okay to concentrate just on the income side of things. But, you know, 99% of the time, you have to look at the the bottom line, your net profits. Because, like you said, with the ads, a lot of people that sit there and they'll say, we we make a $1,000,000 in ads, but they don't tell you that, again, they spent 99 or

Liz Stapleton [00:41:28]:
$990,000

Eric Nisall [00:41:30]:
to make that $1,000,000 so their profit is like 10,000. Yeah. You know, they don't tell you though they don't tell you those things. They only send you

Liz Stapleton [00:41:38]:
-- So people that actually share their expenses be like, okay. Like, alright. I mean, they could be lying, but I feel like most people are good if they're sharing that much they're sharing. You know?

Eric Nisall [00:41:46]:
Oh, you know, people that do like these income reports, generally, they they really give you, like, their actual P and L.

Liz Stapleton [00:41:53]:
Yeah. Yeah.

Eric Nisall [00:41:54]:
but to give that run ads

Liz Stapleton [00:41:55]:
-- P and L is profit and loss.

Eric Nisall [00:41:57]:
Yes. Profit and loss statement. It shows you it shows you what your revenue was, the money that you took in, your expenses, and then it shows you what your profit was. That's really what you're looking, because you can make, you know, I have clients who make, you know, 6 figures in coaching or blogging or whatever, But after they do their own payroll and everything, they they have a loss

Liz Stapleton [00:42:18]:
--

Eric Nisall [00:42:19]:
Yeah. -- on their books because you're putting everything on your credit card and you're not paying off the credit card, you're accumulating debt.

Liz Stapleton [00:42:25]:
Yeah.

Eric Nisall [00:40:07]:
You know, so you're getting you're taking yourself in the hole. So, you know, don't that's why I say, don't look at what other people are doing because if you're just starting out here, you don't have the money, don't jump into, you know, meet Edgar which is, you know, $70 a month for social media marketing, do a free, hoot suite

Liz Stapleton [00:42:44]:
account or something. or yeah. Yeah. Something that gives you

Eric Nisall [00:42:48]:
yeah. They have they have products that give you, like, you know, 5 accounts or 3 accounts and maybe 200 items a month for free. you know, get, you know, build on that, reinvest the money that you do make into your business, and then you can start building up towards using more professional products and stuff like that.

Liz Stapleton [00:42:42]:
Exactly. Alright. Well, I think that's a great sort of, introduction to blogging in as a business and what they should do to get set up right and what they need continue paying attention to to stay in sort of that that business mindset, and it's okay if you have a loss or per share. Is there any final words you would add?

Eric Nisall [00:43:23]:
Don't be scared to ask for help. That's that's something that a lot of people say. Admitting that you need help is not admitting at your failure. you know, and especially if we're talking about blogging specifically, know that you're not gonna most likely make a profit in the 1st 6 months a year. So if you're not getting the traffic, you know, if you're not getting it viral, if you're not making, you know, sales of, you know, any products that you sell, Don't worry about it because nobody does when they're first starting out. You know, that's why a lot of people, they started out as know, something that they do on their lunch break or after work because

Liz Stapleton [00:44:00]:
-- And blogging always starts as a passion project. And I always say if you can make it a year, because you're not gonna make a lot of money that 1st year, typically. If you can make it a year, chances are you're gonna make it. you know, because you've you've been at it that long, and you've probably have brought in some money, and you'll continue to just build on that.

Eric Nisall [00:44:17]:
Yeah. Just because you know what you're talking about does not mean that you're entitled to have read everything that you write or, you know, buy your stuff because I'm I'm living proof of that. I went, like, 6 years before I even had like, any kind of, like, affiliate sale or ads on my site because even though I knew what I was talking about, if you have to market yourself and you have to have that patience and you have to provide value to people So, yeah, you know, have patience. Don't be scared to ask for help if you need it. And just -- Watch it our the summit. Go go slow and steady and pay attention to what, you know, to what other people are advising you on. you know, watch this, the part about this, the legal side of things. You know, watch the part about social media, like, you know, because you're gonna learn things that you can implement yourself you want to spend money on right away. So you'll get free advice. It's it's basically like paying a coach for a 45 minute, you know, session for free. Yep. And getting something for free is the best thing when you're starting out.

Liz Stapleton [00:45:15]:
Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. Alright. Well, thank you, Eric. I really appreciate you taking the time we ran a little bit long, but, hopefully -- It's

Eric Nisall [00:45:22]:
my pleasure.

Liz Stapleton [00:45:23]:
