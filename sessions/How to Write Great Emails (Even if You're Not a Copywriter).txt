Welcome to How to Write Great Emails (Even if You're Not a Writer). I am so glad that you're here because email marketing is a great skill to learn for your business, since email marketing is not going anywhere. You might as well learn how to make the most of it and make it work for your business. Before we get into it, let me just briefly introduce myself. My name is Anna Crosby, and I run Geni Collective, which is an email marketing consulting company. I love email marketing, obviously, since I'm giving a presentation on email marketing, and I also love the technology that comes and is available with email marketing and automation. I have been in business since 2013 and exclusively online since 2015, so it did not take me very long to realize that having an online business fit my life and my personality better than having an in-person business. Fun fact, my very first business was selling handmade jewelry. I am also a social media avoider. I avoid using social media. I don't use it in my personal life or for my business. I've built my business entirely relying on email marketing. I do this every day and this is the way that I communicate with my audience, and I should say the only way that I communicate with my audience, outside of obviously doing these talks and other collaborations and outreach.

[00:01:43.200] - Anna
I am also a very introverted person. I love having time to myself and recharge. I mention this because email marketing for me is uniquely suited to introverted traits. If you are also an introvert and you struggle with knowing what to say or struggle with showing up, then I'm going to have some tips in here for you, as well. Lastly, I am also a max level nerd because I have a PhD in Cognitive Psychology and Neuroscience. I've spent the better part of a decade learning everything that I can about the brain and how it works. Combining this with learning about marketing later on in life just seemed like the perfect pairing for me to go into business. So that's it about me. Let's talk about you. You are here, probably, I'm assuming, because you want to write good emails. And more importantly than that, you want to write emails that make you sales, that make you money, right? But more than that, you want to feel proud of your emails. You want to look at an email that you wrote and say, "Oh, gosh, that's a great email." You want to feel proud of the emails that you put out there.

[00:02:59.260] - Anna
And maybe you've also sent emails before just because everybody says you should be doing email marketing, you should be sending emails. So you've probably sent emails just to send an email with no strategy or higher purpose than that email whatsoever. If that's you, absolutely no judgment because we've all been there. And you're also probably here because you're not a copywriter or you don't consider yourself any, really, kind of writer. That's very common for the clients that I work with. They come to me and they say, "Well, I just don't know what to write. I'm not a writer. I've never written anything. I'm not interested in writing a novel in email form." So if that's you, you are in the right place. And optionally, you are a bit on the introverted side and you just generally find it hard to show up, especially with emails. It's optional. You don't absolutely don't have to be an introvert to get the most out of this talk. But if you are, then it is a bonus. Here's what we're going to cover, really simple. I'm going to tell you about seven things that you should consider when you're writing your emails, to take your emails from like, "Ah, at least I sent an email", to "Wow, that email I wrote was really great."

[00:04:24.170] - Anna
All right, so we are going to go ahead and dive straight into the first one. And I want to get this out of the way because I know as business owners, we want everything to be perfect. We want everything to be professional and polished and all of those things. And that's the first thing we're going to have to let go of when you are doing email marketing. Email marketing is a marathon, not a sprint. Each individual email will build on your strategy. But each email, if you have a tech mishap or a typo or something like that, it's not going to break it. Again, a lot of my clients worry about these things, right? And maybe you are worried about them too. You're worried about making typos or spelling errors. You're worried that your emails are too long or too rambly, or tech mishaps like forgetting to put the variable that inserted somebody's name in the email. It just has "Hello, first name," and it doesn't actually put it in there. Stuff like that. This is what everybody is worried about. If you were worried about these, don't worry, it's completely normal.

[00:05:32.280] - Anna
But you know what? Your subscribers don't care about these things. That's the good news about it. What do subscribers care about? They care about connecting with real people. They care about communicating informally. Email is an informal way of communication. It's not like you're writing a book. You're writing emails. We write emails to friends. Well, maybe less so nowadays. Nowadays, we just write them text messages and instant messages. But email is an informal method of communication. People are also interested in being friends with people on the internet. If somebody is following you, you want to make them feel like you are a friend to them. You're not somebody who is an unreachable celebrity, and email really facilitates that. I want to say that don't let this perfectionism or wanting to make your emails super polished, super professional. Don't let it stop you from reaching your people right now, because your people need you and they need to hear what you have to say. So let's just get it out of the way, let go of all of the perfectionism, and let's reach the people right now.

[00:06:47.120] - Anna
The second tip that I have for you is to know the purpose of every single email that you send. There are some emails that are focused more on education. There are some emails that are focused more on getting engagement. There are some that are focused on sending you to a sales page so you can make a purchase. The purpose of each email is unique. You might say, "Well, duh." When you are sending one-off emails like your weekly newsletter or your regular campaigns, you might think, well, that makes total sense. But it also makes total sense when you are looking at emails in a series such as a welcome sequence or a sales sequence. The way that I teach how to write welcome sequences, which I'll tell you more about at the end of the presentation about how you can get that for free, in the way that I teach, I teach to write six emails, and each one of those six emails has a specific purpose.

[00:07:47.030] - Anna
Like I said, some emails are focused on getting engagement. Some emails are focused on building connections. Some emails are focused on going to a page to decide to make a purchase. The same is true of a sales sequence as well. Not every single email is focused on... Well, obviously, the call to action is always to go to the page to make a purchase, but the purpose of each email is different. For example, you might have a sales email that talks about why they want to get the item that you're selling. You also can have emails that share testimonial or other success stories that make the customer or potential customer, imagine what it's like to own that product. When you know what the purpose is of every single email that you are writing, it makes it that much easier to write this email. Not to mention that when you know what the purpose is, it makes every single email that you send, whether it's standalone or in a sequence, have a strategic purpose to them.

[00:08:56.850] - Anna
Tip number three, you want to share your story and let your subscribers get to know you. Of course, email marketing is still marketing, so you need to talk about your products, you need to talk about your services and the successes that your clients are getting, all of those things that we normally think about when email marketing, but you also need to talk about yourself beyond what you can do for them. This is the reason why I shared a little bit about myself in the introduction. I let you know my background and where I was coming from so that you can put everything that I'm telling you about email marketing into practice. For example, I don't use any social media. I built my business only using email marketing. That tells you that when I talk about email marketing, I talk about it in that standalone way where it's not dependent on another system like a social media profile in order to work. So you know that about me. And if you join my email newsletter, you'll hear talk about all other kinds of personal things that have absolutely nothing to do with email marketing. I do that so that I can share more about where I'm coming from in my experience so that we can make a connection together. Because here's the thing. People can buy what you are selling, the same thing that you're selling almost anywhere on the internet. The internet is a huge place, and there's lots of people doing the same thing that you are. However, you want to distinguish yourself. Why would people want to buy that thing specifically from you?

[00:10:33.970] - Anna
That is because people buy things from people that they like. In order to infuse some of that likability factor, you need to also talk about yourself and your story and your experience in the emails that matters a lot. All right, next thing. Then I'm going to talk about promotion and promoting with integrity. What does that actually mean to be authentic in your promotion? You hear that word a lot. Everybody talks about being authentic. It is the most important thing to be authentic when you are actually promoting something, especially if it's an affiliate product or a software that you want to make an affiliate commission on. My biggest advice is to always promote the tools and resources that you have actually used, or tried to use, or test it out yourself. That is the biggest thing for when it comes to promoting something with authenticity. I know that nowadays, bundles are the big, huge thing, and everybody is running a bundle and everybody is contributing to bundles. I think it is just a fantastic way. It's a win-win for everybody involved. This issue of authentic promotion comes up probably more than you would think because not all bundles are created equal. Not all bundles have the value that you would expect, and sometimes that leads to a sticky situation when you are trying to promote.

[00:12:09.140] - Anna
My best advice on how to get around these issues is to really focus on what you know is good value and be honest about what is not. That doesn't mean that you have to say, "Well, this bundle is not very good value, but you should check it out anyway." Focus on what you know is a good value. You know your products are in there. Instead of talking about all the hundreds of resources and the worth is such, and such, and such, focus on promoting your product in the bundle because you know that even if they don't get anything else from the bundle, they're still getting a great deal by getting your products. That is one way to deal with that, while staying in integrity, sometimes it may mean that you have to back out or not participate in a promotion if you see that you cannot promote it in authenticity. But one thing that I will say is that your audience will learn about your values and how you do business based on how you handle situations like these.So focus on what you know is great value. If it's something that is actually going to be helpful to your audience, focus on that.

[00:13:28.810] - Anna
The next tip is to give them choice. And by them, I mean your email subscribers. And that is, and I know this is a little bit of a controversial and emotionally-charged topic, you want to make it easy for people to opt out of certain emails, and you want to make it easy for them to unsubscribe. And here's why. Email marketing, when it is done right, is a pull marketing, not a push marketing. So the difference between them, a pull marketing is when you are organically attracting people to read the stuff that you write and to see your promotion and to go get your offers. Push marketing is what you see normally on social media with advertisements where advertisements will pop up into your feed, whether you've asked for them or not, usually not. You want your email marketing to be pull marketing. You want people to want to read your emails. You do not want to push your emails onto people. That's why a big aspect of email marketing is getting consent in the first place to join an email list.

[00:14:36.410] - Anna
That's really very important with GDPR and Can-Spam laws. You want to make sure that people are actually opting in to hear about your stuff. That consent, I don't feel like it's a blanket consent for everything. If you are running a promotion and you're emailing them every day for a week and a half, you might want to give them the option to opt out of hearing about that specific promotion or even one of your regular content. So if you have a blog post and a video and a podcast and you are sending separate emails promoting each one of those, maybe you can let people opt out of, for example, if people don't listen to podcasts or if people are not interested in watching your videos, if they just want to read the blog post, make them, or give them, rather, the option of telling you what they want to hear about the most. Here's the thing. When I say this, inevitably somebody is thinking, Well, if they don't want to hear about it, they can just delete the email and move on. Maybe that's what you're thinking about right now too. Why should I go the extra mile to create all the system for people opting out and telling me their preferences if they can just delete the emails that they're not interested in?

[00:15:59.470] - Anna
Well, here's the thing. You don't want to train your subscribers to delete your emails, which is essentially what you are doing when you are giving them everything and anything under the sun that you have and they're only interested in a small part of it. They'll, for example, if you're running a promotion and they're not interested in the promotion, they're going to be deleting your emails that whole week that your promotion is going on. You don't want them to delete your emails. Not only is it bad for your deliverability long term, but it's also letting them know that when they see your name in their inbox, "Oh, this is about the membership that I don't care about," and they'll just delete the email after the promotion is over, they might still have that gut reaction to delete your emails because they think it is promotion related. So don't train people to delete your emails. The other thing too is to make unsubscribing easy. A lot of people feel weird about unsubscribing because they think that you'll know that they unsubscribe and they don't want to hurt your feelings or just goes to their promotions folder and they're not interested in reading it, so they just leave it there and it goes there to die a slow death.

[00:17:13.670] - Anna
Whatever the case is, make unsubscribing easy because the people who are not interested in getting your emails after a certain point will never become your customers. Why should you be paying for them in your email marketing software? Why should you be spending all this effort and sending them the emails? Why should you have your open rates suffer and your click rates suffer just because somebody's just not interested in it and they just feel bad for unsubscribing? Make it super easy. Tell them in the first email that you send to them, "Hey, you're going to be hearing about such, and such, and such. If you're not interested in this, click here to unsubscribe or scroll to the bottom and unsubscribe. No hard feelings, no questions asked." I feel like you would think, well, people would know that, but saying it explicitly makes it easier for them to do it if that's what they want to do. Again, don't train your subscribers to delete your emails. Instead, give them the choice and respect their inbox.

[00:18:14.800] - Anna
All right, next, we're going to talk about relevancy. For those people who don't want to unsubscribe or opt out, they want to get your emails and they want to hear from you, there's one thing that you need to think about for those people, and that is personalization, making sure that the emails are relevant to them. It's not just me saying this. A 2021 survey done by McKinsey and company found that 71% of customers expect personalization, and 76% of customers are frustrated when they don't get this personalization. And just in case you're wondering, this goes way beyond just putting their first name in the email, that is a form of personalization, but more than that, it's sending emails that are relevant to what that person is interested in. And you can know what they are interested in by the previous products that they purchased from you, where they signed up, what incentive did they sign up for? All of those things are clues about what they are interested in and what their next steps are. Customers actually expect to be engaged and onboarded when they first make a purchase. That was a specific question that they asked on this survey, and the vast majority of customers said that they do expect this engagement and onboarding.

[00:19:42.960] - Anna
What's the takeaway here? You want to regularly ask for your subscribers' preferences, and solicit feedback, and then write to them based on what they said they were interested in. This is really easy to do with your freebie when you're structuring your welcome sequence, which I'll tell you about at the end of the presentation. But you can talk directly to what they are interested in because you know what they're interested in. They just got this freebie on this topic. It's especially relevant if you have multiple freebies and multiple ways that people can come into your email list, those onboarding sequences make the biggest difference. So do not skip on those engagement and onboarding sequences when somebody first joins your list.

[00:20:29.920] - Anna
Here we are, we are focusing on value next. This is the next tip: What is in it for them? This is not to say anything bad about anybody. We are all humans and our brains work in exactly the same way. When we are looking at our email, we are looking for something interesting, something to give us a dopamine hit, something to entertain us. Whenever we are looking at the subject lines inside of our email inbox, we are asking ourselves the question, "What's in it for me? What am I going to get out of this?" If it's not immediately apparent what I'm going to get out of this, I'm going to be less likely to click and open that email because I just don't know what to expect.

[00:21:16.360] - Anna
When you are writing not just your subject lines, but your emails in general, you need to answer these questions. Why should your subscribers care about everything that you're saying in this email? How will what you are saying or what you are offering help them? Why should they do what you want them to do? If you want them to click to go to the sales page, why should they do that? You want to really spell it out for them. You want to say, "Hey, you want to get my welcome sequence because it's the most important email sequence that you ever write and all of your subscribers are going to get it?" It's really important that you get this right. You need to get my welcome sequence templates, which I will tell you about in a minute. But you want to make sure that you are explicitly telling them the value. Why should they care about this? When you are writing each and every single email, this is what I want you to focus on. Because the word value is generally associated with free content, I want to let you know that selling something is providing value too, because paid products are going to always be better than free products. Your paid products, you've spent a lot of time thinking about the solution and thinking about how to organize it and thinking about making it a complete solution, not just a piece of it that you give away for free, but a complete solution. So when you are selling an offer, you are really providing value to your subscribers.

[00:22:49.270] - Anna
So, here we are at the end of them. Probably should have numbered them in this presentation so I could keep track. But that focus on value, if you don't get anything else out of this presentation, I hope that you at least remember when you are writing each and every single email to make it really explicit why somebody should care about this email. Somebody who's not you, right? Why should somebody on your email list care about what you're writing about? These are all of the tips that we talked about. We let go of our perfectionism. We know the purpose of each and every single email that we write, even when they're in a series. We know that we need to share our stories and our personal experiences to give context to what we're talking about. We always need to promote with integrity whatever the form of that takes, whether it's using the product ourselves and focusing on what we know is good value to pulling out of promotions where we do not feel we can promote them with integrity. We want to give them a choice, a choice to stay on our email list or a choice to get or not get certain types of emails, and we want to make it relevant and "Why should they care?" That is, in a nutshell, what the seven tips. If you keep these in mind when you're writing your next email, I think it will really help you to write a better email than just the generic, "Hey, I made this thing. It costs this much. Click here to get it." This will make you a better email writer and you do not have to be a copywriter for this. If you notice in my introduction, I did not say I was any copywriter and I am not a copywriter. However, I write good emails, and this is why I share how you can write good emails as well.

[00:24:49.670] - Anna
