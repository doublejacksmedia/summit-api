Hey, guys. Liz Stapleton here, the host of the Blogger Breakthrough Summit. And I am so thrilled that you are finally getting to see the summit in the sessions because I've been working on this for months and the speakers have just totally blown me away with their generosity and their knowledge and their actionable advice. They're over the shoulder sessions where you see their screens and how they would go about things. I have a long list of to do's after watching it. I know you will, too. But it is a lot, right? There's over 50 speakers, and I know that can be overwhelming. And so in this session, I'm going to walk you through how to get the most of this summit without totally burning yourself out. So it's probably going to be a little bit short of a session than some of the others. But I'm going to walk you through best practices and where you can find all the stuff and just orient you to the summit. So if you're coming to my party this summit, I'm going to just show you around. So first thing I want to touch on is don't try to do all the things Because like I said, there's over 50 sessions, which is a lot.

[00:01:04.450] - Liz Stapleton, Host
So pay attention to the categories. The way this summit has been designed is so that each topic typically has three sessions, one for beginners, one for intermediate bloggers, and one for advanced bloggers. So if you're a beginner, focus on just the beginner sessions. And where you want to dive deep, go ahead and watch those intermediate and advanced ones, but pick those based on what your goals are. Don't try to watch everything. Figure Find out what level you're at and then what is most important for you to learn, your goals. And then you can dive deeper because the way it is, they are released at the same time. So the email marking sessions are typically released at the same time. And you want to watch all of them. You will have 24 hours on the free pass to do so. And you can watch one when it airs, you can watch the one, you can go to the replay of the other one. So you'll be able to stack them on the ones you do want to dig deeper. So don't stress too much if you want to watch multiple sessions that are at the same time.

[00:02:02.010] - Liz Stapleton, Host
I structured it that way because it is more meant beginner, intermediate, advanced. But I totally understand if you want to dive a little deeper. So I do want to just show you real quick. When you go to the website, you can see the schedule, and you can really dig in there. And you should be able to pick based on the category. So you can do advanced. You can see all the beginner ones. You could say, okay, I do recommend everyone watch the legal ones. I feel like no matter what level you're at, it's probably a wise choice. And also the business ones are talking about finances with some accountants and how to manage stuff. Those, I think, are great. But you can then dig in and see what they are. And you'll also be able to see what your schedule is. So you can see what's in yours and you can even add the calendar reminders and add additional talks if you maybe didn't quite understand when you were registering what you were doing, because I know it can be a little bit confusing. So I just wanted to make sure you understood that. So don't try to do all the things that's going to help you in getting the most out of this summit.

[00:03:06.710] - Liz Stapleton, Host
And then get involved as well. So there's a Facebook group. Go and join that group if you haven't already. And interact with the other attendees. There's many speakers in there. So if you have questions, ask. A speaker may be able to answer if it's for someone specific or even just... I mean, there's a lot of expertise in there. So don't be afraid to ask questions. Engage with the other attendees. I'm going to have some engagement threads to help people really take action and move forward and see what you guys are liking the most so that we can make this even better next time. So get involved, join the Facebook group. That's another great way to make sure you're getting the most out of the summit. And then take advantage of the perks. So I've managed to work with some not only incredible speakers, but some great companies as well to get you guys some perks to save you time, to save you money. And you can see all these. When you're here, you can see there's just a perks section. Of course, I'm going to have something random show up on my screen. So in here, you can see there's also a couple of giveaways going on.

[00:04:13.490] - Liz Stapleton, Host
So at the end of the summit, I'm going to be giving away, thanks to Social Bee, a year of the Social Bee Accelerate plan. So it's a great value. It's a great tool. It's what I use for social media automation. And then I'm also giving away an all-access pass. And if you've already bought an all-access pass, I'll I'll refund you that and you'll still get the all access pass. So don't sweat that. There's also a magic pin generator that you can use. Create 50 pens for 10 posts in five minutes. A $30 credit for new tailwind customers. My legal templates bundle, I'm doing $47 off, so it's a great deal. Podia, which is what I used to sell my digital products, and I love them because you could do memberships, digital downloads, and courses, and product bundles. Really, it's amazing. They're offering 15 % off PodiaPlan, and that includes also 14 day free trial if you want to test that out. So it's fantastic. And then you can also see what some of the speakers are offering as well. Some of them are doing a giveaway, some of them are doing other gifts. So you can make sure to register for those if you're interested in those giveaways.

[00:05:21.230] - Liz Stapleton, Host
So definitely make sure you check out the perks because who doesn't like perks, right? And just take advantage of them. There's So pretty much every speaker has a free offer for everyone that just helps people dive a little deeper onto the topic, and that is included in the talk as well as the summit session notebook that is a fillable PDF, so you can take your notes and be able to find them. And you'll also see the resources that they talked about. So it's a great way to just keep everything together. All right. And then just, again, take it one step at a time. So you'll see in the summit, we have a session with Jennifer Dawn, who I tagged it as a keynote. And I would recommend everyone check out the keynote. I think they're for all levels. And she's talking about mindset, but she also does a great job of breaking down how to deal with overwhelm, because I guarantee you after the summit, you're going to have a ton of action items. And so I definitely recommend watching her or her session because she will tell you how to get through that and come up with a plan of action.

[00:06:25.350] - Liz Stapleton, Host
And another thing that could help you is finding an accountability buddy from the Facebook That's a great place to find people who know what you're working on and what you're talking about. And you can buddy up and make an accountability plan. Make sure you stick to that plan of action after everything you've learned. And then if you really, really want to get everything out of the summit, then give yourself more time, right? Because I have designed the summit to keep it moving forward during the week that it's free. But shorten the learning curve by taking advantage of the perks or some of the offers that the speakers give. Get the resources that are out there to help. And consider the All Access Pass because that will give you lifetime access to the summit sessions so that maybe you go through and you watch all the beginner sessions and then you implement all that and then you go through and watch all the intermediate sessions, right? And also the All Access Pass comes with over $2,000 a value in discounts and products from our speakers and contributors. So you can learn more about that here. It's just [inaudible]

[00:07:29.300] - Liz Stapleton, Host
 and so it lists out. So I'm including for All Access Pass holders, my privacy policy template. I am an attorney. I always say that going to an attorney and getting one personalized is always the best option. But I know not everyone can afford that. And so using a template, especially when it's written by an attorney, is a great thing to do in the meantime. That's the next best step. But when you get to that point that you can hire an attorney, do that. But also Cindy Bidar is giving away to All Access Pass holders her email marketing momentum course And then Lanie Lamar is including her Airtable Like a Boss light course. And I will tell you, Lani's session blew me away. It had me completely re... I love Airtable and I use it already. Airtable is a free tool, by the way. It had me completely rethinking how to use it. And she includes a free Airtable sheet in her presentation. So definitely, if you're having trouble organizing your thoughts in terms of your blog content, check that out. And that's just in the session. But in the All Access Pass, she's also including this, which is great.

[00:08:32.530] - Liz Stapleton, Host
And so that all totals to 165. But then there's all the discounts. So Jessie Festa has a one month free to her membership. There's 40 % off Conquer Your Business Analytics, 100 % off Sales Page Secrets. The list goes on and on. So this value is over... I need to update that. I think it's actually over 1,800. I need to check my math. And so total value of the discounts and products is over $2,000 So it's a great, great deal. Plus you get lifetime access to the session so you don't miss one and you can always go back to it. And it's only... If you're watching this early, then you've already bought the all-access bath. But if you're watching this, it's $97 while the Summit is live. So it's a great deal. It's the action taker price. Once the summit is over, it's going to go up to $197, which is still a great deal. But if you want to really get the most out of the session, consider the All Access Pass. But Absolutely not necessary if you just don't want to spend that money just yet. You can think about it the next few days.

[00:09:36.060] - Liz Stapleton, Host
But definitely pay attention to the categories. Think about your goals. Think about where you want to dive deeper and plan ahead because these sessions will only be available for free for 24 hours after they air. So just keep that in mind so you can plan your time accordingly. So excited to have you guys here. I'm so excited to finally be able to show everyone this.
