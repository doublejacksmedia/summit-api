Hello and welcome to this presentation on how to use Notion to manage your blog content. I'm KP. I use she, her, or hers pronouns, and I'm the founder of Inkpot Creative which is a queer-led show at website design studio building unconventional impactful branded websites for changemakers who are leading our industry by creating something different. I am also the host of The Unexpected Entrepreneur podcast. However, before I ever even started Inkpot Creative, I actually started a book blog back in 2012 which has since been completely rebranded and is now a travel blog called Volumes and Voyages as of 2019. And that's because back in 2019, during my junior year of college, I studied abroad in Dublin and was inspired to start a travel blog. Ever since, I have been chasing my wanderlust and following my passions. I'm truly happiest when I'm on top of a mountain with a good view and no signal. But in order to take trips and stay on top of my work, I really had to implement a strategic system, and I found that Notion was my ultimate solution. Before we get started, I did want to mention that you should really try not to follow along with everything that I'm doing at the same time.

[00:01:23.240] - Krystianna
So, I would recommend watching the video all the way through first and then, of course, like pop back in, if you need to, to rewatch things and then try to follow along there when you can actually pause the video as you go. And of course, if you have any questions, feel free to pop them in the chat because I will be there hanging out with you. So, by the end of this presentation, you'll have a solid idea of how to create and implement a Notion blog management system. As far as the agenda, we'll first start by talking a little bit about why you should use Notion, why it's a great fit, and why I personally love it. We'll also talk about how to use Notion to your advantage. So that's when we'll dive into more of the tutorials on how to create and manage content, how to organize your posts, and also how to collaborate. And then we'll also chat about some action steps, and I'll also give you a free gift. So keep in mind as well that this is just what I found works for me. Notion is definitely not for everybody, and the way that I organize posts probably won't work for everybody.

[00:02:16.170] - Krystianna
So, don't feel like you have to do exactly what I do. You can take part of it and add it into your own system, especially if you already have something that works well for you. You really have the power to take what I am teaching and put your own spin on it. So, let's start off by talking about why you should use Notion and what makes it so great. So, if you've never heard of Notion before, Notion is a productivity app. You can use it for pretty much anything from planning your daily life to organizing your blog content. You can think of it kind of like a mix of different project management tools out there like Asana or ClickUp or even Trello combined with Google Docs. And the only difference is you build everything from scratch which means you can custom tailor it to your specific needs. Some great features of Notion include to-do lists, so you can keep track of what you have to do every day. And you can also assign tasks, which is awesome if you have a team. And you can also go through and even add due dates to your different tasks too.

[00:03:10.970] - Krystianna
You can also pretty much embed anything from videos like on Loom or Google Drive, to maps and even audio which makes it so great to pretty much just collaborate with anyone that you need to. You can also create databases which is what we'll mainly be talking about today. So you can organize your content in a whole bunch of different views. So you can use tables which is what is in the photo over here. You can also use Kanban boards which is kind of like what you'd see on Trello. You can use galleries if you're more visual. You can also use lists, timelines, and calendars. There's also an app, so you can easily check your content or add any new content while you're on the go or while you're traveling. And this is actually one of those apps that works super great. I use it while I'm on the go all the time, especially if someone tags me in something. It is so easy to just like open it up, respond quickly, and just continue whatever I'm doing. And it is also free. So there is a paid version, but if you don't have a team that you need to collaborate with, then you can 100 percent start with free.

[00:04:05.750] - Krystianna
So that's what I did. And then you can upgrade later. And if you do end up wanting to use the paid version, it is only eight dollars a month, starting at eight dollars a month, I'll say, which is a lot more budget-friendly than other tools out there, at least from what I have found. And if you're currently managing your blog content somewhere, let me know if any of these sound familiar. Let me know if you've ever felt disorganized. So one thing that I ran into a lot was I felt like I was juggling multiple platforms for various parts of blog management. So I was using, you know, something like Later for my content creation. Then I was tracking my published posts in my Google Sheets, and I was trying to collaborate with a team somewhere else, or even inconsistency. So one thing that you might run into is if the tool that you're using is hard to use and has a steep learning curve, you might avoid going in there to keep it updated at all which can cause a lot of inconsistencies, so, for example, if you have 500 posts on your blog, but only 480 are actually being tracked in your current blog content management system.

[00:04:59.520] - Krystianna
And collaboration -- so you might have difficulty in team collaboration sharing ideas and getting feedback, and you might have also found that it always costs more to add somebody to whatever plan you're on and also ease of accessibility. So it might be difficult to access your content and make updates anywhere anytime, especially when traveling. So, having something on your phone would probably be a lot easier. These are all issues, again, that I personally ran into and Notion has honestly solved all of them. So for instance, with this organization, one thing that Notion does is that it is all in one. So, it combines writing, organization, and collaboration. So you can create a content calendar for your blog, for your social media. You can collaborate and more. No more inconsistency because of the way Notion works. You can be completely in control. So, you get to decide what is and isn't in your dashboard for your blog. You really get to custom tailor it to you and your specific needs. And collaboration -- so, it is so easy to collaborate. You can easily share things. You can comment and tag each other. You can also assign tasks which makes team collaboration effortless, and it also does not cost as much to add people.

[00:06:06.730] - Krystianna
And lastly, there is universal access. So it has a synced/offline mode where you can work offline, and when you get Internet again, your edits will be uploaded directly to your database, and then there's also an app. All that to say, Notion can help you feel more empowered when it comes to managing your blog content. So this all sounds great, but how do you actually use it to manage your blog content? To start off really simple just make sure you make your Notion account if you haven't already used Notion before. So you can do this at Notion.so. And again, you can probably start off with the free plan. And then from there you'll want to go ahead and set up your dashboard. So to make this easy so that you do not have to start it from scratch and you can pretty much just start from a template, I have made one for you that you can easily duplicate and customize to your needs which you can grab at inkpotcreative.com/breakthrough. Once you've duplicated it, you'll want to go ahead and brand it. If you want to, this is totally optional, but it is one of the cool and fun things about Notion.

[00:07:06.560] - Krystianna
So you can add a cover photo to add a photo of your favorite place. So for instance, that photo on the left is a photo of my actual Notion dashboard that I use for my blog. I have a photo of Bryce Canyon just because it's my favorite national park here in the US. You can also upload your brand's logo, and you can also go through and change any of the colors. Next, you want to go ahead and start to customize the board for your needs. So, I recommend that you sit down and think about what you actually need when it comes to tracking your different blog posts. So obviously you're going to want your blog post title, but maybe you also want to track your keyword or the post category, or the post URL, or even if you have any back links to that content, what affiliate links you have in that post, et cetera. And if you're not sure, you can totally just use what's in the board already. I'm pretty sure I have all of those actually in the board and then some. And then if you find that you don't use specific parts of the board, you can always delete them which I'll show you how to do.

[00:08:00.720] - Krystianna
You might also find new columns that you wish were actually added in, and you can add those in as you grow. So, my board actually changes all the time. So now let's hop over to Notion to go over how to customize the board by removing the different categories that you don't need. So this is what the database will look like after you've duplicated it and added it into your own Notion account. So the first thing to do is if you decide that for each of your posts, you do want all of this information, but maybe you don't want all of it showing, what you'll do is click this little button with these three dots, and then you'll hit Properties, and you'll be created with a little list that looks like this and you'll see all these little eyeballs, and essentially all you have to do is click on one if you don't want it to show in this actual database anymore. So let's say maybe you no longer want to have the category here, you can just go ahead and hide it. And the cool thing is if you've just hidden it in the table, if you come over here and actually open up that specific blog post, you'll still be able to see the category in here.

[00:09:03.310] - Krystianna
So really, all you're going to customize right now is everything at a bird's eye view. If you decide you want to add something back in, you could just turn that back on and you can actually drag it up to wherever you would like it. Alternatively, if you decide there are any that you like 100 percent know you don't want at all, this is also where you can go ahead and delete them. So you can come in here and just right-click and hit delete property and it will fully delete itself. So next, you are going to want to go ahead and customize your post templates. And this is where you will actually add in all of those different categories and all of those different elements that we talked about back in step four. So some things you can update during this time is your post categories and your affiliate programs as well as any statuses, if you need them. So just to kind of briefly go over it. When it comes to post categories for me on my database, what I like to do is make them location based. So I blog mostly about the United States. So what I'll do is I'll make different categories for each of the different states,

[00:10:05.040] - Krystianna
and then if I do ever do anything on another country, I will have a country category. You can also just easily match these up to the same categories you use on your own blog, if that helps. For affiliate programs, I actually go through and add all of the different affiliate programs that I use which I'll show you in the next slide. And then for statuses, I actually use statuses in order to kind of track if I've updated a post or not because I try to update my post every six months. So here is what one of my post templates actually looks like with a post that I've added into my own personal Notion database so you can actually see it in action. So, you'll see up here we have the post category, and this is again where I would just put the location for affiliates. Again, like I mentioned, I'll go through and add all the different affiliate programs I'm in, and if I know that it's through a certain place like Travelpayouts, I'll like kind of write an abbreviated version. So this is like Travelpayout to Discover Cars. And I have it set too so that I can multi-select. So if there is multiple affiliates in a post, I can go through and check them all off,

[00:11:04.620] - Krystianna
and then same with the post category if I ever have to. For keyword, this is pretty basic, just where I write the keyword out. I do have a pins one right now because I was recently going through and making sure that all my posts have new pins directly in the post. So I added, like, a checkbox just so I could track that. Then I also have this ranking one because I recently also went through and was tracking on my rankings with all of the updates that have been going on. And that's just so, again, I can track how rankings are doing. For status, this is how I keep track of if I've updated a post or not. So I have statuses for not started, in progress, and updated. Then URL is pretty self-explanatory. This is just where I go ahead and put the URL in for the blog post just in case I ever really easily need to grab it. So now, I'm going to briefly go over how to add those in Notion into your templates. Okay. So now, we are back in Notion, and what you'll want to do this time is actually click on this little blue arrow, and you'll see a option that says Post Template.

[00:12:03.020] - Krystianna
And what you want to do is hit these three dots and click Edit. And basically, what this is doing is editing a template in the database. So now, anytime you go to add a new one, you will actually get created with a card that looks like this. It'll have everything that you're adding directly into that template for you to fill out. So, if I just go back to that really quick, what you want to do first is go in and add your categories. So to do that just click where it says empty and you'll have these options. You'll see a few random states in here that I put in here just as placeholders for you. To change those, you can just click this little button with the three dots, and you can come in here and change it to whatever you want. So, you can just do it like that. You can also change the colors if you want to be really specific. Then if you need to add new ones, you can just type in right here and just hit Create and it'll add a new one for you, and make sure you keep none of them selected because this is the template.

[00:12:53.800] - Krystianna
Otherwise, if you add a new post, it'll have that category auto-selected for you. Affiliates -- again, this is just where I kind of list out my different affiliates so you can edit these ones if you want. Just click these three dots and you can change what they say. And then if you need to add any more, you can add them in the same way you did with your category. These you can leave blank because these are going to be dependent on each specific post. Status -- this is one that you can definitely just keep how it is if you will be kind of updating your post as well. And then I also have a web stories one in here which you can either keep in here or like rename to pins or use it as whatever you'd like. And then this section two, if you ever need a spot where you really want to be taking notes before you even like publish a post or anything like that, you can add like some more templates down here. So maybe you always like have a specific checklist you follow as you're doing research you can literally be like research checklist. And then you can add a block for a checklist.

[00:13:51.850] - Krystianna
So, if you hit forward slash on your keyboard, you'll be brought up with a screen that lists all these different block options. So, you can type in checklist and then you'll have a to-do list. And you can list out step one, step two, and you can list out anything you want. But just know that anything you type out here again will be in that template. So, it will be there for every single post that you go to write. And then once that's saved, all you have to do is hit back and you'll be brought back to this. And then when you go to hit New, you'll see that now it'll be updated. So, if I come in here, it should have Nevada in here which it does. So that's how we know that it worked. And then if you need to add any new categories in, what you want to do is make sure, again, you're in that template and you just want to hit Add a property. So, if you want to add a new one in, just come and try to find the specific type of property you want to add. There are so many options.

[00:14:43.190] - Krystianna
So maybe you always want to upload your featured image or something you can click files and media and just change this to featured image. And now, you'll have an option where you can actually upload a photo. You could also get even more fancy with it. Maybe you want to add a calendar so you can search for date. Maybe you want to have last updated. You can come in here and now you have a calendar where you can add dates for it when you update your posts. So what your next step is to organize your blog posts. And if you have a lot of posts like I did when you start implementing a system like this, this is going to take you the most time. So start by creating as many views as you need. I like to have different views for all posts, to do, completed, and then have one for pins and web stories. And what this is going to do is just basically give you a filtered databases. So what that means is if I want to add one maybe that will only show me all of my Nevada posts, all I have to do is click this button and I'm going to create a new table.

[00:15:42.620] - Krystianna
And that's just because that's what I kind of had set up already. So, I'm going to call this one Nevada Post and hit done. And then I'm going to want to filter it. So, I'll click, Filter, Category, and I'm just going to check Nevada and that'll only show Nevada because I have it saying category contains Nevada. If I want to have it just show the posts that aren't Nevada, I could click does not contain and that'll show me all of the other ones. So, I recommend going through and adding this in for each of the different views that you want. You can also further organize by choosing the layouts that you prefer. So as you saw in that quick screenshot that I just showed, I choose table, and that's just because I kind of prefer to see everything all at once like that. But there are also boards. You can use a timeline. You can use a calendar, if you want to organize it by date published or something. You could use a list and you can even do a gallery which is a great option if you're a super visual person. And then once that is all set up, you're actually on the last step of organizing.

[00:16:38.880] - Krystianna
And this is the part of six that is going to take you the longest, I promise you. It is very tedious. Unfortunately, it does have to be manual. But, if you have a virtual assistant on your team or a friend that can help you, then it will go a lot faster. So this is when you're actually going to go through, click that little blue button that says New and go through and manually add all this information for each of your posts. I did want to mention too, if you need to collaborate at all, Notion makes it so easy to share with anyone that you want. So you will have a button in the corner that will say share. You just want to click on that and then select the access that you want someone to have. So generally, I'll give people can edit access because then they can go in there, they can comment, they can add things to the database and everything like that, but they just can't share it with anyone else. If you do like have a partner or somebody that you run the blog with, you can go ahead and click Full Access, and then everyone that you've added will be able to go ahead and fully change things.

[00:17:29.830] - Krystianna
You just want to be careful if you do can comment or can view, those people will not be able to add anything to your database for you. One thing I want to mention is you will see an option to hit publish and just make sure you don't publish it to the web because what this can do is it can also, I've heard anyway, start ranking on Google which you don't want because then everyone's going to see all of your blog information. So I know that was a lot. So here's just a quick recap of what you should do -- action step wise. So, go ahead and set up your Notion account. Use free unless you know you'll be collaborating a lot. Then start by setting up your dashboard. So for the purpose of saving time, go ahead and just duplicate that board that I created and shared. And then, optionally, you can go ahead and brand it if you want to make it feel more like you by customizing the cover photo, the icons. You can add your logo and everything like that. You can also customize the boards. So think about what info you actually need for your posts.

[00:18:26.280] - Krystianna
And if you're just starting, know that the less you have can be a lot easier to manage. And then you want to customize your post template, so go ahead add in your categories and everything like that. And then lastly, organize your posts. So, go through, set up your different views, your different filters, and begin adding all of your backlog. Just know that it will take you a while. When I first started organizing my posts, I already had more than 300. I really wished that I had started organizing things sooner, and it took me about a week to get everything all set. But it helped me so much in the long run. If you have any questions, feel free, again, to pop them in the chat. Now that you have watched the presentation, I truly do geek out about Notion, so I'm happy to answer any and all questions. And again, to help you kickstart your Notion journey, I did go ahead and make that dashboard for you that I showed you way back at the beginning, and you can grab that at inkpotcreative.com/breakthrough. And this is a great way for you to at least have a starting point when it comes to starting to track all of your blog posts in Notion.

[00:19:30.550] - Krystianna
And if you do ever want to learn more about how to use Notion in your business, Standout with Notion is in the Speaker Bonus Bundle. And this is a course that I created that literally goes over how to create different Notion dashboards from scratch. This one does cover a lot more kind of geared towards actual business owners. So, it will show you how to make things like client portals if you ever work with clients or anything like that, and also how to create your own to-do lists. So it does go a little bit deeper.
