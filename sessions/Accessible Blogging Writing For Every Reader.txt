Hey everyone. I hope you've been enjoying the presentations you've watched so far. It's surreal that I'm speaking at the Blogger Breakthrough Summit because it was the first ever virtual summit I attended. And so it feels like I've come full circle. I want to say a quick thank you to Liz for asking me to be a speaker. And I hope you will enjoy my presentation. So my presentation today is about accessible blogging and how to write content for every reader. And what I mean by every reader is including disabled people, people with different learning styles, and everyone, literally everyone, and not leaving anyone out. Here's a quick overview of what I'll be talking about today. I'll start by explaining what online accessibility is. Then I'll talk about why you need to care about it. The next part is about the five accessibility features that every blog post must have. And I'll also be sharing the best practices for each feature. And then to finish, I'll do a quick summary. But first, it might help if I introduce myself. Hello, I'm Ami. I'm an online accessibility consultant, and I help bloggers and online business owners by providing actionable tips and resources on how to implement online accessibility best practices without feeling overwhelmed.

[00:02:08.380] - Ami Hook Ireland
I do want to put a disclaimer out there, as I'm not a legal expert, and all the information I provide is based on my own personal experiences with inaccessibility and what I've learned about online accessibility over the years. That's one variant of my business, and the other is that I also create PLR, which is Private Label Rights products, such as printable and digital journals and planners, custom Canva frames, and lots of other different things as well. I'm a mom to a three-year-old girl version of Sonic the Hedgehog, and I'm married to the man I hated when I first met him over a decade ago. I have multiple disabilities. I have hearing loss, central vision loss, sensory ataxia, and transverse myelitis. I do have more, but it'd probably take up the rest of my presentation trying to explain them. Now, if you're wondering why on earth I'm wearing a horned headpiece in my photo? It's because I am a massive, massive fan of Loki and Tom Hiddleston. And my lifelong, well, okay, only not a year long, dream came through in 2021 when I met Tom at MCM, Comic Con in London. It was an amazing day, it really was.

[00:03:57.820] - Ami Hook Ireland
Anyway, moving on quickly before I get carried away talking about Loki and all that. Let's get started. What is online accessibility? Online accessibility is making websites and any form of digital content and products easy to use and understand for everyone, including disabled people. This then enables us to navigate the online space independently. For example, as I have hearing loss, I need post captions and transcripts to understand what is being said in videos. Another example, as I have central vision loss, I need font to be very clear, have a high contrast, which I'll explain more about shortly, and paragraphs to be broken up so they're not this massive block of text and don't put too much strain on my eyes. There are so many examples, but at the end of the day, accessibility is making something easier for people with accessibility needs to be able to access it like everyone else. And speaking of everyone, accessibility does affect everyone, including you, because say, for example, you find it easier to listen to a podcast version of a blog post. You can then access the content in a format that's easier and more convenient to you. And that's accessibility in a nutshell.

[00:05:54.170] - Ami Hook Ireland
It doesn't just apply to disabled people, it benefits everyone. Because we all learn and take in information in different ways. And let's move on to why you need to care about accessibility. Now, there are so many different reasons why you need to care, and I have two big statistics I'm going to share with you. The first one is how many people there are worldwide who have some degree of sight loss. How many do you reckon there are? Maybe tens or hundreds of thousands. According to the World Health Organization, there are 2.2 billion people worldwide who have some degree of sight loss. So things like not providing alt text for images in your blog post or not having a good color contrast between the background and the text, things like that mean you are potentially excluding up to 2.2 billion people from your content. Another statistic I founds from a charity called Mencap in the UK, which is for people with learning disabilities. So according to Mencap in the UK alone, there are 1.5 million people with a learning disability. Now, people with learning disability also benefit from alt text as some use the screen reader, which is a type of assistive technology that reads aloud text that's on the screen.

[00:07:53.700] - Ami Hook Ireland
Another thing is not using plain and simple words when writing. If you use a lot of big, complex technical words, then you're all potentially excluding 1.5 million people with a learning disability, and that's just in the UK. I reckon worldwide it could be billions. Now, I know these statistics are a lot to take in, and I want you to know it's never my intention to make you feel bad when I share statistics like these. But it is important to know why things need to be accessible and who they impact. But you are doing the right thing by being here and learning from what I'm sharing today. It shows you care about accessibility. It shows you want to learn about it, and it shows you want to take action. I know accessibility isn't the sexiest of topics, but it is a very important one. Just to remind you, I'm not a legal expert, so I can't give you any legal advice about accessibility. That being said, it is important to know that in some countries, it is a legal requirement to have an accessible website. I have included a list of the countries that I'm aware of where accessibility is a legal requirement in the resources part of my free gift.

[00:09:33.580] - Ami Hook Ireland
But at the end of the day to do your own research on it. And I've talked about some of the less positive consequences of inaccessibility. So let's look at the positives and how writing with accessibility in mind can have a huge positive impact on your blog and business. You can reach a wider audience by making your content accessible. This helps increase your page views and your blog and your brand become more visible. So more people know how awesome you and your content are. It can also increase conversions. So by sharing the accessibility of something, for example, a course you're promoting in your blog post and saying what format it's in, you'll increase the chances of people buying through your link. Because people want to know this and they want content in format that's successful and convenient to them. At the end of the day, you don't know what you don't know and you don't know all the needs of every reader that lands on your blog. It also shows that you and your brand value inclusion, and you're aware that everybody is different and that we all have different needs and we don't all fit in with the same status quo.

[00:11:20.030] - Ami Hook Ireland
But the most important reason is that it's simply the right thing to do. It's horrible feeling excluded and not being able to access the same things as everyone else. But all these negative things and feelings can be prevented by making your content accessible. And it can be done quite easily when there's straightforward instructions on how to do it. And this is what I'll be talking about now. So you're going to find out the five accessibility features every blog post must have. Now, a little heads up, I'll try to create a fun way to hopefully help you remember these five features. You're about to read five acronyms and what they stand for. What are five accessibility features every blog post must have? The first acronym is D.A.T, which stands for Descriptive Alt Text. The second is GOAT, which stands for Good and Obvious Anchor Text. The third acronym is EARL, which stands for Everyone Appreciates Readable Language. The fourth is MEANS, which stands for Mighty Ease And No Squinting, which is relevant to color contrast. And the last acronym is CHAOS, which stands for Clear Headings and Organized Structure. In essence, DAT GOAT EARL MEANS CHAOS will increase the accessibility of your blog post, and it is very easy to do.

[00:13:34.990] - Ami Hook Ireland
There you go, DAT GOAT EARL MEANS CHAOS. Now you know the five features, it would help to know more about them and their best practices. That's what we'll move on to next. Let's start on with alt text. What on Earth is it? Alt text is the description of an image. For example, let's go back to the photo of me and Tom Hiddleston. The alt text would be, Ami is in her wheelchair on one side of the screen with Tom Hiddleston kneeling on one knee on the other side. They have one hand against the screen, which makes it look like their hands are touching. Okay, so alt text is essentially what is happening in the image. Now, a shorter and more concise version could be, Ami and Tom Hiddleston holding hands against each side of the screen. And both are acceptable versions of alttext. Here are some things to avoid when writing alt text. Keyword stuffing, it makes alt text unreadable for screen reader users, and it does appear as spammy, which can also negatively affect SEO. For example, the photo of me and Tom, keyword stuffing for that would look like Loki actor, MCM, comic-con, Tom Hiddleston, fan meets Tom Hiddleston.

[00:15:36.860] - Ami Hook Ireland
It don't really give an accurate description of the image. Another is starting with image of. This is because screen readers announce that an image is coming, so starting with image of just adds unnecessary repetition. Another is repeating the same information as it doesn't provide any new information, and it can be quite confusing. Type in blank, spacer, or empty, and in your alt text, it doesn't really convey any useful information of the image. And relying on the file name like image002.png, it's not exactly going to help anyone as it doesn't give any context about the image. Now, what you can do is be descriptive as it helps users understand the image and how it's relevant to the content. Another is to be concise and keep it short and to the point. So it offers enough detail for understanding without being overly wordy. Now, I know it's difficult to be descriptive and concise at the same time. Even I still struggle sometimes. But as long as you keep practicing, you will find a nice balance between the two. Also include important details. So these are things like what is happening and what it's being shown in the way it is, including key details like these make the image more meaningful and it helps readers engage with the content more.

[00:17:54.960] - Ami Hook Ireland
You can include one or two keywords, as it not only helps readers understand the topic of an image, but it can also improve the image's SEO. It can also consider the overall context of an image. So what you need to think about is how the image fits into the overall context of what you're writing about in your blog post, and make sure that your alt text complements that context. So for example, the photo of me and Tom, because my readers know by my blog post that I'm a massive fan, I would also include in my alt text that I was internally squealing like a happy pig in mud. Adding that little extra context to my alt text helps to convey the image and how it's relevant to what I've been writing about. And it provides the reader with the reading experience that flows and just makes complete sense. Moving on to anchor text. What is the anchor text? It's the clickable text in a hyperlink. Now, let's get straight into what to avoid. A big one is to not use generic text like, 'Click here', as it doesn't tell readers about where the link will take them.

[00:19:59.990] - Ami Hook Ireland
Whenever I see a hyperlink that says, Click here, I automatically think, Am I going to Narnia or Asgaard? I want to know where you're taking me. Another is to not mislead. So for example, if the anchor text says free download, and it turns out that you're taking me to a subscription form, this would then make me frustrated. It would make me feel like your content is less trustworthy. So it's always important to give the correct information. Also, avoid using the raw URLs as the anchor text as it doesn't really give any descriptive information, making it look like the same as the rest of the text in your blog post. The readers might not recognize the hyperlink, which can then lead to missed opportunities for the reader to engage with the content and to not use all capitals as it can appear as aggressive and it is harder to read. What you can do is be descriptive as it helps readers understand where the link will take them and what to expect. You need to be concise and keep it short as it makes it easier to scan and read your content. And it also improves the reader experience.

[00:22:07.760] - Ami Hook Ireland
Keep it relevant. Ensure that the anchor text is directly related to the content of the linked page. It's best practice to include the main keyword as it adds value to the context and can also boost SEO. Now, if you have lots of links in your blog post, consider changing the anchor text to prevent confusion and ensure that the anchor text for each link is different enough to avoid readers getting confused. Next up is Readability, which is making sure content is easy to read and understand. It's as simple as that. One thing to avoid is assuming that your audience is familiar with the topic you're talking about, and having the same level of knowledge as you do, at the end of the day, they're there to learn from you, and they want it explained in a simple and easy to understand way. Try to avoid overly long sentences, as these can come across as quite complex and confuse readers and just make it difficult to understand. Another big one is using unnecessary big words, because every time I come across a big word that I've never heard of before or I don't know the meaning of, I go straight to Google to find out what it means.

[00:24:11.820] - Ami Hook Ireland
Nine times out of 10, I usually forget to go back to the page I was reading. So it's always important to simplify the words you use if possible. Don't be afraid of using image or two as they can simplify difficult concepts and make the overall content more accessible and engaging. What you can do is use clear and simple words as these improve content accessibility and understanding. For example, instead of using the word convoluted, just say difficult, simple as that. You can use lists and bullet points as these help to break up the content and make it much easier to scan and take in information from your content. I always recommend using short paragraphs, so four or five lines maximum, as these are much easier to read. Make use of the white space around text to make it much easier and more comfortable on the eyes, and it also improves how your content is presented. And use a consistent format. So by maintaining the same structure throughout your content in terms of fonts, styles, and sizes, that consistent format helps your content to flow, and it's much easier to read. Next up is color contrast, which is the difference between light and dark.

[00:26:23.450] - Ami Hook Ireland
Some things to avoid are using similar colors. Low-colour contrast can make content hard to read, and it is inaccessible to some readers. For example, black text on a dark gray background, it's just completely inaccessible, really difficult to read. Another is to not rely on colors to explain something, so don't rely solely on color to convey information or meaning in your content as it can exclude people who are colorblind and they can't visually understand the information correctly. So for example, the crosses and ticks I've been using in the best practices slides if I just had them as the cross and the tick without the words next to them. To someone with color blindness that would come across as the same colors, so it's not really giving them the accurate information I'm trying to get across. Try to avoid using the same colors for the hover and focus of a hyperlink. So for example, a link that changes color when hovered, but doesn't show any visual indicator of the focus. It's not easy to tell the difference between the two. So it's always important to make sure hover and Focus Colors are very different from one another.

[00:28:33.480] - Ami Hook Ireland
Another thing is to not ignore accessibility standards like WCAG, which is the Web Content Accessibility Guideline. I can't remember the exact number of what the color contrast needs to be to meet accessibility standards, but I have put the number in the resource as part of my free gift, as I've included with color contrast checker. What you can do is use very clear and distinct colors. For example, dark black text on a bright white background like on my slide. Use color contrast checkers like I just mentioned, and these will quickly tell you and verify that the colors you're using comply with accessibility standards. Do try and understand that not all types of vision loss the same. Understanding these differences helps you to make content accessible to broader range of people. You can provide the content in a different format. For example, if you have an infographic and it's represented by different colors, provide text underneath the image to explain what those colors represent. It will help the reader to understand the infographic better. Last step is headings and structure, which are used to create an easy to follow format. Some things to avoid are overly long heading as these can turn out quite complex and be overwhelming for the reader.

[00:30:55.020] - Ami Hook Ireland
Try not to skip the heading hierarchy, which is basically the order of headings that they need to follow. By skipping these heading levels, it can confuse readers and it disrupts the flow of the content. Try not to use too many different colors, fonts, and sizes in your blog content. For example, using five different fonts and colors for various heading, it comes across as inconsistent and also appear as disorganized. But try not to overuse heading levels unless necessary. For example, using every heading level in a short form blog post, it doesn't really make sense to use them and ends up complicating the content. What you can do is use descriptive headings as these help readers to quickly understand the content's main point. Make sure you follow the heading hierarchy, which is the order of headings, so H1, H2, and then H3, and so on. This helps to structure the content and makes it more organized and easier to understand. Try to keep the structure of your content the same. And by using the same font size and color for all the headings and subheadings. By making all of this consistent, it improves the appearance and readability of your content.

[00:33:09.890] - Ami Hook Ireland
You can use subheadings to break down complex content into more manageable sections. This then helps make the content scannable and helps the reader to go through the content more smoothly. Finally, ensure there's white space as it makes the content less crowded and improves overall readability. I know there was a lot to pack in one presentation, so if you need a quick summary of what I've covered today, here you go. Online accessibility is about making websites and any form of content easy to use and understand, not only for disabled people, but people with different learning styles too. You need to care about accessibility because by not making your content accessible, you could be excluding billions of people. In some countries, it is a legal requirement, but there are lots of positive effects that making things accessible can have. It helps you to reach a wider audience. It can increase conversion rate, and you and your brand will be known for caring. Last but not least, DAT GOAT EARL MEANS CHAOS. I hope these acronyms will help you to remember the five features every blog post must have. Again, which are 'descriptive alt text', 'good, and obvious anchor text'.

[00:35:12.550] - Ami Hook Ireland
'Everyone appreciates readable language', 'mighty ease and no squinting', which is related to color contrast, and finally, 'clear headings and organized structure'. Remember, DAT GOAT EARL MEANS CHAOS. We also covered the best practices for each of the five accessibility features, which I won't address them here because there were quite a lot. But we have definitely covered so much today, and I really hope you've learned a thing or two from my presentation. As mentioned a few times, I am providing a free gift, which you can get somewhere on the page that this video is on. I've included lots more examples, the tools I use, and reliable resources that I've trusted for years. I hope you find all that helpful too. One final thing I want to say is that accessibility is not a do it once and forget type of thing. It is ongoing and it does require you to be proactive with learning, implement and accessibility. I can promise you it's not all technical, it's not all that difficult once it's explained clearly and in simple and plain words, that's basically what I'm here for. That's what my business is about. I want to help you understand it in a way that actually helps.

[00:37:01.030] - Ami Hook Ireland
I think that's everything. So thank you so very much for attending my presentation today. And again, I hope you've learned a few things. And if you do sign up for my free gift, then I can't wait to get to know you. Thanks again to Liz for asking me to speak at the summit. It's a surreal experience, and it's absolutely a huge milestone in my online business journey. Thanks again, and I need a drink now after talking for however long. Bye for now.
