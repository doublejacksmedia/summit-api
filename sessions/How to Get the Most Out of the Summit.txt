Transcript:
[00:00:03.710] - Liz Stapleton, Host 
Alright, I think I'm live.

[00:02:48.670] - Liz
Hey, guys! Everyone logging on?

[00:03:02.190] - Liz
I am working to see YouTube live has changed a little bit, which is how I'm running this. So this is going to be a little bit interesting. We'll see how it goes and I apologize ahead of time if something goes wrong. All right, if you guys can hear me, I'd love it if you could pop in the chat, which is to the right of the video and just say "Hi", let me know where you're from.

[00:03:30.120] - Liz
I'm going to give it a couple of minutes, since it's not actually 9 o'clock yet, but it looks like some of you are here already. So.

[00:03:46.510] - Liz
Are we excited for the Summit? I'm excited for the Summit.

[00:04:22.170] - Liz
All right, guys, it is officially 09:00 a.m.. It is time to kick off the Summit. I'm super excited. I hope you guys are as well.

[00:04:33.330] - Liz
Yeah, so if you guys want to just take a second, say hello. To the right of the video, you should see like a chat box. It's got like a little like chat icon. So if you can comment there and chat and say Hi and let me know where you're tuning in from.

[00:04:49.500] - Liz
Hi, Becca.

[00:04:51.990] - Liz
Let me know where you're tuning in from and what you're most excited about. So this is live. Most of the sessions are pre-recorded.

[00:04:59.340] - Liz
South Florida. So nice. No. It's actually been really cold there lately, hasn't it?

[00:05:06.730] - Liz
So, this is live. Most of the sessions, like I said, are pre recorded, but the speakers will be inside the chat to the right.

[00:05:14.680] - Liz
Oh, my goodness! Yay! I love seeing you guys. Caitlin, Susan. Kimberly. Melissa. Patrice. Dana, Angel, Linda, Katie. Bianca, Kelly, Shria.

[00:05:28.130] - Liz
Hi. From California. I'm originally from California. Catherine. Wow.

[00:05:33.090] - Liz
Thank you guys so much for joining me. Massachusetts. I lived in Massachusetts for ten years. I love Massachusetts. I've kind of been a little jealous of the Blizzard pictures I've been seeing.

[00:05:44.030] - Liz
Okay. Alabama. Yes. Okay. Yay! I'm so excited!

[00:05:49.490] - Liz
Turns out I've got a small hiccup. So video livestreaming with YouTube. It used to be that I could share my screen and I'm not seeing that option. So this is going to be a little bit different than I had planned, but we're going to carry on and we're going to work through and it's going to be super exciting. So part of this session right now is going to be...

[00:06:12.870] - Liz
Outer Banks! See, I moved. I lived in North Carolina for four years. I've moved all around, guys. I've lived in all the corners of the US.

[00:06:23.790] - Liz
So this session could be a little bit like how to get the most out of the Summit and sort of what you should be doing, what you shouldn't be doing. We're also going to do a little bit of where do you find all the things? Because I love to offer lots of stuff with the Summit, but not all tools can accommodate, so I use multiple tools and I know it can be a little bit confusing from your end.

[00:06:49.450] - Liz
First of all, I do want to encourage you, if you have any questions, to leave them in the chat to the right of the video and I will keep my eye on them so I can make sure I answer them.

[00:07:00.370] - Liz
But first, hopefully you've noticed that all the sessions are categorized, right? So we've got beginner, Intermediate, advanced. And the way I kind of think of those levels, are beginner is you either haven't started your blog or you've just started your blog or even blogging like under a year and you haven't seen a lot of results. Intermedia is you've started seeing some results, you started making a little money, you're trying to grow that. And advanced is you're looking, like you've got a solid foundation, you're looking to scale. Okay, so those are sort of the beginner, intermediate, advanced sessions. I really encourage you not to try to watch...

[00:07:39.650] - Liz
Oh yes, angel, try refreshing your feed.

[00:07:50.790] - Liz
So, I really encourage you to kind of pick a level, beginner, intermediate Advanced and stick with it because there's so many sessions! Like do not try to cram it all in. It is a lot. It's taken me months to work through all these sessions.

[00:08:06.510] - Liz
So, if you're a beginner, stick with beginner. If there's maybe one or two topics that you want to dive a little deeper on and you want to watch the intermediate and advanced versions, then go ahead and do that. But really limit it to no more than a couple specific.

[00:08:25.230] - Liz
Yeah, Cindy, really my point is don't try to watch every single session like it will be too much and you will feel overwhelmed and your to do list will be insanely long. I mean, even if you just follow, even if you just kind of follow like one level, you're still going to have quite the list of ideas, I think. Which is why you should absolutely attend the implementation session on Friday, which I will also be teaching live.

[00:08:56.940] - Liz
And by then I will hopefully figure out how to share my screen. Although I don't know that I need you for that anyway!

[00:09:03.150] - Liz
Because in the implementation session on Friday afternoon, you're going to basically come up with an action plan for all your ideas that you got from the Summit. Okay. So that's really my biggest piece of advice is don't try to watch all of them. Pick a level. Maybe in some areas you're at a different level. Then watch the session that applies to you there.

[00:09:22.970] - Liz
And you can always go and look at what sessions are, what categories. So there's the levels and then there's categories that's all listed under categories in Hey Summit.

[00:09:33.790] - Liz
So if you go to schedule at the top of the page...There you go. Jolanda, sorry. And if I'm mispronouncing your guys' names, I'm sorry. I'm doing my best.

[00:09:46.370] - Liz
So if you go to the schedule, there is a view by category so you can view by level and you can also view by topic. And it'll show you what sessions are and you can always add them to your calendar depending on what you got going on. But also I believe in the notebooks inside your Swag Bag, and we'll get to your Swag Bag in a second, I believe the schedule is in there, or at least I only have the notes for that level.

[00:10:10.730] - Liz
Thank you.

[00:10:13.370] - Liz
So the page you are on right now watching this session. Okay. To the right, you have the chat. You guys are using it. It's awesome. I love it. And the chat to the right is where speakers will be live in the chat when their session is airing.

[00:10:31.990] - Liz
But below, if you scroll down, there is a comment section. There we go. Some people have been using that. And so if you want to kind of leave a comment, especially if you love the session, you just want to give the speaker some love. You can do that in the comments section, but the chat is where it's really going to be focused live. Also on this page, when you scroll down, you're going to see the description, you're going to see info about the speaker, visit the website and on the right, which I don't have one for this session because you're here at the Summit, that would be what I want you to do.

[00:11:06.980] - Liz
You can see the speakers like call to actions and a button to go check it out. The speakers aren't going to get your emails unless you go to their site and you sign up for everything. Yeah, they aren't going to get your emails. I don't share the list with all the speakers. So if you go to the site and sign up for something, you'll start getting emails from that speaker, but otherwise you're not going to get 50 speakers sending you emails. So that is really the Summit page.

[00:11:34.380] - Liz
Now when you aren't able to attend live or if you want to re watch something during the 24 hours it's available up at the top of the menus, you should see replays. So, the replays will be the replays will be up in the menu. You can click on it and it will show you the replays. It'll show you all of them. But you're only going to be able to actually watch the ones from the last 24 hours. If you click on one that's already expired, it's going to be like your access has expired. Okay.

[00:12:06.560] - Liz
Only the sessions we sign up for, right? I'm not quite sure I understand that question. Like you only get calendar reminders for the sessions you sign up for, but you can attend all of them. I'm not quite sure I understand your question, Denise.

[00:12:29.150] - Liz
Oh! No, even if you signed up for the speaker session, unless you actually go to their website and sign up for something, they're not going to email you.

[00:12:49.830] - Liz
I like to follow the rules. So you should see up at the top replays schedule speakers. If you just want to learn more about the speakers perks, I'm going to cover that in a second. And then there's always upgrade. If you decide you want longer access, you can upgrade to either the All Access pass or the Pro Pass and the information on that page. And that's all I'm going to say about that.

[00:13:10.590] - Liz
So the perks, this is where there are some...Let me answer a question real quick. Are the extra resources only available in the live sessions? I didn't see them in the Propass. Extra resources, like the freebies and stuff, or like the call to actions from the speakers.

[00:13:30.170] - Liz
They should be inside the Propass, especially in the notebooks. I'm trying to think if I actually added them where the sessions are. I feel like I did, but I would have to double check that I was sick when I was trying to put all that together, and I'm a little bit like, did I do that? I'm going to make a note to check that so that later today, in the Facebook group, I can comment on that.

[00:14:04.850] - Liz
Yeah, Catherine, you can attend any of them, like the ones you signed up for, like add to your counter, that you should hopefully just get your calender ding or whatever as a reminder. That doesn't mean you can't attend the others or that you have to attend them.

[00:14:21.830] - Liz
Sorry, can I repeat that?

[00:14:25.950] - Liz
Extra resources, so Felicia, I'm assuming you're talking about like the speakers, like calls to action and stuff that they might have? Like if they have a freebie or something? Those should be available in the Pro Pass, in the notebooks, in the Action Taker Workbook in the Speaker Offers section. I don't remember if I added them specifically where the videos are in the Pro Pass. I'm going to double check. So I was sick when I was trying to get all that in and together and so I don't quite remember. So I will double-check and I will make a note to talk about that inside the Facebook group. And we'll talk about the Facebook group here in a minute. But hopefully that helps so.

[00:15:06.450] - Liz
The last thing I want to show you in Hey Summit. So, Hey Summit, this is where you're at right now is where all these sessions are going to air. If you have the Pro Pass or All Access Pass, that access is inside Thrive Cart, you are still not going to be able to view these past 24 hours in Hey Summit, because that's just how it's set up so.

[00:15:26.100] - Liz
The perks, though, are where you can find some discounts that some companies have kindly extended to you guys as attendees. They're super awesome. And I will be sharing more about those in an email and putting a spotlight on them because I feel like the last couple of years people didn't know they were there.

[00:15:45.510] - Liz
The legal template perks that are in there, so those are from me.

[00:15:50.170] - Liz
I'm actually doing a special sale today. I'm going to say if you're interested in legal templates, don't buy them through the perks yet. Look out for the email today and check out the Facebook group because there's going to be a better deal today. After today, those are going to be the best deals so. That's the perks.

[00:16:10.390] - Liz
Now let's talk about another perk you should already have access to is your Swag Bag. So your Swag Bag is inside of Thrive Cart. And if you don't have access to it, shoot us an email. So if you log in to it should be doublejacksmedia.thrivecart.com/l/ and you should be able to sign in or hit forgot password.

[00:16:33.710] - Liz
And inside there you should find activity books. So for your kids, there's even one for like your partner. There's a blog post template. So if you are already blogging and you're like, I need to get a post up. This week there's a roundup blog post template that you can use and it's a generator, so you just fill it in. It will give you a rough draft. There's also BINGO.

[00:16:56.080] - Liz
So inside the Facebook group, if you guys aren't in the group yet.

[00:17:00.390] - Liz
Oh, yeah, I can totally put the link. That sounds like a good plan.

[00:17:08.290] - Liz
Here we go. Not just 24 hours. The Swag Bag is not 24 hours. No, you've got access to the Swag Bag for forever. And Pro Pass gives you unlimited access. But that unlimited access to view like the sessions is inside Thrivecart. So it's not inside Hey Summit.

[00:17:25.230] - Liz
So when you log into that doublejacksmedia.thrivecart.com/l/, you should see your Pro Pass access and all the videos and everything are in there. And I'm going to work on trying to I got to figure out if I'm going to be able to add the chat.

[00:17:41.330] - Liz
So that I can post. Yeah. Yolanda, is that closer to your name? Am I pronouncing it better? Yay, I can figure it out.

[00:17:57.990] - Liz
And if you haven't started your blog inside the Swag Bag, you'll also find like start a blog, walk you through some stuff so. The BINGO card though is in there. And so each day in the Facebook group, if you haven't joined the Summit Facebook group or if you've requested to join, you haven't been let in. I have a tool that is automatically approving people based on criteria, and I've said that if you did not answer all the questions for joining the Facebook group, you will not be approved. And so I'm trying to go through and those that didn't do it, declined so that they can re-request to join and fill out the questions again.

[00:18:37.050] - Liz
So the BINGO card. So I've already posted in the Facebook group the prizes today. So each day there's going to be different prizes.

[00:18:44.430] - Liz
The rules for BINGO is inside your Swag Bag as well. And you can only win once. But so you have a BINGO, you'll comment on the BINGO post with it. I will close out that comment thread at probably 05:00 or 06:00 pm pacific time today and then draw winners for the prizes. So each day it's different prizes. I can tell you that there's going to be a couple of chances to win, like the All Access pass or the Pro Pass or the Website Legal Templates Bundle.

[00:19:15.660] - Liz
Today, the prices are 1000 Short Pixl credits per month. The second prize is Website Legal Templates Bundle and the third prize is the All Access Pass. So it's super fun.

[00:19:27.970] - Liz
I will be going live at the end of each day inside the Facebook group to just say Hi and hang out and talk about some tips that might help based on what you guys learned today.

[00:19:40.680] - Liz
So like today, I believe on my notes I'm going to talk about I'm obviously going to talk about BINGO and make sure you know what's going on. I'm going to be talking about that special sale I have and then just in general, answer any questions you guys have.

[00:19:55.470] - Liz
It is the same Facebook group as last year. Yeah. I like to say I'm too efficient to create new Facebook groups each year, but it'st... Efficient is definitely my code word for lazy.

[00:20:10.810] - Liz
Okay. And then I haven't been given access yet either. Okay. Janet.So, literally the tool is working on it right now. I see it going through stuff because it pops up and tells me.

[00:20:24.190] - Liz
You'll also find inside your Swag Bag the session notebooks. So they're broken out. I think I've got beginner, intermediate and advanced. So you kind of pick one or multiple. They are PDFs and they are fillable on your computer. So if you don't want to print them out or you want to be able to type or something, you should be able to do that.

[00:20:43.960] - Liz
There's also a separate notebook for the Implementation Workshop that will be taking place on Friday. And then, of course, the step-by-step text setup tutorial to start your blog is in your Swag Bag as well. Okay.

[00:21:00.050] - Liz
Could you put the link for the Swag Bag? Yes, actually, I'm going to go ahead and put it in the comments because there's not as much going on in there. So that way you can see it inside the comments. Okay. Which is further down on the page.

[00:21:19.170] - Liz
Angel, I'm really sorry. You can't get it working.

[00:21:24.310] - Liz
Okay. What's the difference in the Session Notebook and the Action Workbook? So if you got access to the Action Taker Workbook that is like cheat sheets for each session and it gives you action items based on what the session is about and everything. So I've gone through and I've created cheat sheets and been like, okay. And it's like prompts of like, hey, this is what the talk is talking about. What are you going to do? What are your notes on this prompt?

[00:21:53.770] - Liz
Whereas the session notebooks, they include information about the speaker and their offers and tools they use and stuff, but it doesn't give you the cheat sheets or the spark notes or whatever. So the action taker workbook is really designed to help you take action quickly. Hopefully that answers your question.

[00:22:20.590] - Liz
All right.

[00:22:28.790] - Liz
Okay, let me check my notes on what else I wanted to make sure we talked about. So the Facebook group, like I said, it's going through right now and approving people. So hopefully you'll be approved soon. Ideally once you request, you should be approved within a few hours. If you didn't answer all the questions, that's, I've got to manually reset things.

[00:22:55.290] - Liz
And I also just make sure you're whitelisting my email address so that you don't miss the emails. It's hello@elizabethstapleton.com those are the emails that are going to come from me. You're going to get a couple of emails each day. I try not to overwhelm. You're not going to get an email an hour before every session or whatever, but you will get obviously the email that you got this morning that has the day's schedule. You'll get another email kind of midday with like hey, here's the perks that we got going on and don't forget BINGO and the Facebook lives and stuff. And then one at the end of the day that gives you links to all the replays so that if you missed one you can just go find that. So you'll probably be getting a few emails each day. Hopefully, I try to not keep it, I try not to have it be too many.

[00:23:42.540] - Liz
If you are on my newsletter like you were getting emails from me before the Summit. Then starting tomorrow you'll get extra because freebie February kicks off tomorrow. But generally speaking it shouldn't be like too too many emails each day from me. But make sure you guys are getting them so that you don't miss things.

[00:24:03.690] - Liz
Alright. I think those were like the main things I wanted to talk about during the session, is really kind of pick a lane in terms of level and categories and then making sure you knew that there's this access to Hey Summit. This is where the talks are. There's the Swag Bag. And if you bought the Pro Pass or All Access inside of Thrive Cart and then the Facebook group is where we're going to be having a lot of fun this week in live and interaction and stuff.

[00:24:30.100] - Liz
So, any questions, anything I haven't answered? Any issues I can try to address?

[00:24:46.330] 
Having trouble signing into the Summit. So nothing you should see that should take you to a login page and then once you're logged in you should see just like the Swag Bag. If you aren't able to log in or if you aren't seeing the Swag Bag, shoot us an email. Hello@elizabethstapleton.com or Support@elizabethstapleton.com and we'll get you sorted out. And if you've emailed this morning, we're working on it.

[00:25:17.470] - Liz
It's me and the only other person I have helping is my VA, who is part-time and has other stuff she's got to do. So she's not even full-time, like on top of this stuff this week, she's kindly watching my inbox right now while I am live. But I promise I'm working on it.

[00:25:40.190] - Liz
Can't watch the video that air, right? Yeah. You'll have 24 hours. So if, like the video airs at 1030, you will have until 1030 the next day to watch the replay.

[00:25:54.530] 
Okay. Yeah, Jennifer. So shoot us an email with the email you're trying to get into Thrive Cart with and or the email you registered with so I can see what's going on.

[00:26:08.210] - Liz
One of the issues could be and I'm working on fixing, is if you didn't register through BloggerBreakthrough.com, which then would put you through drive cart and automatically gave you the Swag Bag. If you came and looked at the speakers and stuff on Hey Summit and then clicked on book now and you registered through Hey Summit, then you didn't get added to the Swag Bag because stuff is set up through Hey Summit.

[00:26:35.610] 
So I've had to manually go and pull the people that accidentally registered through Hey Summit and add them and then add them to make sure they get all the emails as well. So if that's the case, I'll go through after this, I've got kind of a list of things I got to do after this session and manually add those people. So that could be the issue, in which case I'm going to do my best. I'm going to go through and manually add those that need to be added. Okay.

[00:27:08.610] - Liz
Is there anything I'll miss if I watch the replays versus live sessions? The only thing like freebies and resources? No. The only thing you might miss is the live chat with the speaker. If you want to ask the speaker specific question, they're not going to obviously be in the chat for 24 hours, so that's really the only difference. But many of them are inside the Facebook group and feel free to ask questions in there and we will try to track down some answers. If I can't answer, I will try to track it down from the speaker. Okay.?

[00:27:39.980] - Liz
Or hopefully you'll be able to then see the chat afterwards. You're welcome, Katie. Okay. Any other questions?

[00:27:52.930] - Liz
Hopefully you guys are excited. I'm excited. The speakers are always fantastic.

[00:27:59.890] - Liz
I always get a lot when I'm going through and getting them ready for the Summit to post and everything. I get a lot. And I've gotten a lot of out of them. Hey, Alison. How are you doing today?

[00:28:11.570] - Liz
Yes, I like it. I like the excitement. My dog was so excited this morning. She threw up and I was like, I don't really need that, but thanks for your enthusiasm.

[00:28:23.730] - Liz
You're welcome! Yay! Guys, I'm excited. It's going to be awesome. Came in after eating lunch and taking the dog out. Yes.

[00:28:30.900] - Liz
I feel you. I don't know why you're holding that's weird. Maybe it's because of. Yeah, I don't know.

[00:28:38.490] 
Yes, Liz, Wilcox brings the fire again. I love her, like, 90s vibe for sure. Actually, when I was looking for speakers, she like, threw her name out there and I went to her Facebook page and it was because this was like before Christmas time and it had like the N*Sync Christmas album and I was like, sold.

[00:28:59.830] - Liz
She is. So we have Liz Wilcox back this year. We have Liz Teresa. So we've got all the Liz's.

[00:29:09.050] - Liz
And we've got some people returning that spoke at the 2020 Summit and we've got new ones. So it's really exciting. There's a lot of really great speakers. Grayson's Back, Aisha Priest, who's new this year. Her session was fantastic.

[00:29:24.840] - Liz
Well, not was, is. I say was because I've seen them all already.

[00:29:28.610] 
Oh, my gosh. That is commitment, Jess! It's 04:30 a.m. in Australia. I plan to watch these days, but I'm still up. Oh, my. Wow. Go, you girlfriend! Actually just could be a boy or girl. So go you. Period.

[00:29:46.890] - Liz
Wow. Yes. And kudos to everyone because the times when they're crazy in terms of all the times listed, places are Pacific Standard Time because that's where I'm located. But the replays should even if the time zones get messed up or you're confused because that totally happens to me, too. Should hopefully still let you watch what you need to.

[00:30:15.390] - Liz
All right. Any other questions? I'm still working during the quiet hours I've got. Sleeping is important. Please get some rest.

[00:30:24.910] - Liz
Okay. Still working during the quiet hours I forgot to sleep. Yeah. No, I do like to work. I do like to get up early and work, but if I'm tired, I don't because then my brain like it'll take me way longer to do something if I'm tired. And so rest is sometimes my most productive use of time.

[00:30:45.790] - Liz
All right, any final questions? Because I believe Erin Perkins session is coming up, I think it's at 9:30...It might be at 10.

[00:30:57.800] - Liz
How long are sessions? Sessions are typically about 30 minutes. So some are as short as like 10 minutes, and some I think the longest is like 37, but most are around 30 minutes. That's a great question, Dana.

[00:31:09.570] - Liz
Thank you.

[00:31:12.650] - Liz
I can't wait. And hopefully by this afternoon I'll have gotten everyone inside the Facebook group accepted. And so you'll be able to watch that live and we'll hang out then, too. Is there a way for me to make an account so I can sign in instead of getting a link?

[00:31:32.070] - Liz
Charlene, sign into what? Is that the into Hey Summit? Into Thrive Cart? 

[00:31:49.170] - Liz
It is going to be epic, Denise. 100%. It always is.

[00:31:55.270] - Liz
The Summit. Okay. So Hey Summit. So, yeah, you should have an account. Are you talking about the links in the emails maybe?

Maybe so I can sign in instead of getting a link. Yeah, you should have an account and a password. Shoot me an email if you're having trouble, Hello@elizabethstapleton.com. Show me like a screenshot or something and we'll get you sorted out.

My dog is being impatient. She needs out. So during the live guys just FYI my dog's name is Lucy and my cat's name is Doug, so if I'm yelling at them that's what's happening.

I think the link was in the first email. Okay yeah and it is here.

This is the link for the Summit itself so you should be able to log in there. If you don't see like a button to log in, the three dots at the right of the navigation menu, you should be able to click that and hit login. I don't know if that helps answer your question.

Oh, and there's another dog named Penny, that is not in here right now, but just so you're aware there's a couple of videos I wasn't quite able to edit out like a little bit of barking, so apologies! But mostly you shouldn't hear it if you have dogs and the barking on the video which is in the background it's very subtle. It's going to set them off. You might want to use headphones. But yeah, I think I got most of it edited out. All right guys, I will see you guys later. Enjoy the rest of the sessions.

Like I said don't hesitate to reach out to me and I will try to respond to you as quickly as possible and yeah, let's go 2022!
