Welcome to the class. We're going to be talking about affiliate marketing and some things that you can and do or implement or some mindset stuff that you can work into your daily lifestyle that can actually help you make more money as an affiliate marketer, as a creator in general. My name is Chelsea Clark. I'm the founder of Her Paper Route. Her Paper Route is a blog, a podcast, a community, all for creators and people who want to learn how to make money in interesting ways online.

[00:00:45.120] - Chelsea
So, we featured creators who are doing just that in addition to offering courses and educational resources on our website, herpaperroute.com and the Her Paper Route podcast. So, when I started that business, my whole purpose was I wanted to be able to create a space where creators could be inspired by other people, how they are making money in interesting ways online, like I said. So that you don't have to just, you know, depend on a nine to five or waste your money in the stock market or, you know, make bad investments and just have that conversation about money, you know that uncomfortable stuff. Let it just be all out there into the world, so that everyone can be smarter with the money that they have and make more of it through investing, through creating online companies for themselves and just everything in between.

[00:01:39.310] - Chelsea
So that is what my company does and that's what I'm going to be sharing here on this call today is some tips for what you can do to make more money through affiliate marketing. So, the first thing I want to say is a good place to start is, what the heck is affiliate marketing? Well, it's very simple. Let's call you a creator. You have a website or an Instagram account or a newsletter, whatever your platform may be.

[00:02:04.210] - Chelsea
You have an audience around your brand, and other brands will want to get in front of that audience that you've put together, and they're going to pay you a commission when you refer sales to them. So, in very basic, in a nutshell, let's say that you have a home decor site, you have your website, you're recommending some products that you found at, let's say, I don't know, Home Depot. It's not really home decor, but you found some really cool home products at Home Depot. You put links on your website that are affiliate links. And when someone comes to your website, they click on that link, and they go on to make a purchase on anything on Home Depot's website, you're going to get a commission.

[00:02:47.140] - Chelsea
So that just means that Home Depot is going to pay you a percentage of whatever that customer went on to buy. Now, it does not cost that customer anything extra. Home Depot or whatever brand, just pays you off of the sale that they get. So, it's just really easy for people to come and buy things and you earn commission just for recommending great products. That's very simple what affiliate marketing is.

[00:03:12.310] - Chelsea
And right now, we're going to share some strategies of what you can do to just make more money at it. But before we do do that, I do want to mention, like why the heck should you even bother listening to me? Who the heck am I? And I just want to say, no, I am not some big billionaire affiliate marketer. I do not have a private jet.

[00:03:32.200] - Chelsea
I do not aspire to have a private jet. I am a very normal, ordinary person. What I do is I actually own multiple niche sites, so multiple websites in different niches and they are all monetized with affiliate marketing. And by doing this, I'm generating over a million dollars in revenue through that. And it's just a great business model.

[00:03:56.140] - Chelsea
It's a great thing to do. Anybody can do it. You do not need to have any special skills, you don't need to have some sort of special personality to be able to do it. Literally, the fact that you are here and you want, you're curious and you want to learn about it, great, you're ahead of the game. Let's do it.

[00:04:16.610] - Chelsea
You're going into affiliate marketing. You have a blog, you want to monetize it, come at it with a mindset of a long term mindset. Okay? You're not expecting instant results. It's not about the short term game plan.

[00:04:31.110] - Chelsea
You are looking ahead to the future and you are planning out for seeing what you're going to be doing next season, like next quarter, next year. You have a game plan for the long term of how you're going to make your affiliate marketing business profitable and sustainable for that long term. Okay? So, we don't want to just start a blog and wonder why we haven't earned anything in the first month, and then just throw in the towel and give up. That is unfortunately what most people do.

[00:05:01.500] - Chelsea
And that is why most people end up not being successful with affiliate marketing because they just give up before the site has even had enough time to actually have a chance at making revenue. So, just know that you're coming into it. You are going to be here for the long term, right? You're ready to try things, you're going to test things, you're going to run different campaigns, and you're not going to give up too soon. You're just going to be consistent.

[00:05:29.210] - Chelsea
Come at this with a business plan. Your blog is not a hobby or your instagram influencer, a dream, that's not a hobby. This is an actual business. So, you need to treat it as such. So, come into this with a plan for your business.

[00:05:46.650] - Chelsea
Okay? So, think about a top of the world, like top-class athlete, right? They don't just do some random exercises here and there. Maybe one week they're not going to work out, and the next week, maybe they will. They don't look at it like that.

[00:06:03.130] - Chelsea
If they are planning to be successful in their chosen career as an athlete. They get up every day and they are working out and they're exercising, and they're bettering themselves, and they're always thinking about their next competitor, and you know their next big game, and everything like that. And that's how you should be thinking of this too. Have a plan for how you are going to grow your blog, your Instagram, your Tiktok, whatever it is. It doesn't really matter the platform, but you are coming at it with a plan and a system in place of how you're going to get there.

[00:06:36.990] - Chelsea
And it doesn't have to be fancy. I'm not saying you need to spend a week figuring this out. I mean, like after you finish watching this call, you're going to get a notepad and a piece of paper and you're just going to write out your plan. Just like that. Like creative.

[00:06:50.370] - Chelsea
Don't stop yourself, don't try to edit yourself. Just blah. Write it all out. Everything that you are going to do to grow your business, what your goals are, and how you are going to reach them in the next three months, six months, two year, put it out into the world, write it out as a notepad, and then start doing it.

[00:07:11.660] - Chelsea
Tip number three is accept that money is everywhere. It is just waiting for you to set up the systems to get to you. Okay? The money, the success, it's all already there. You've already got it.

[00:07:25.810] - Chelsea
You just haven't put the step into place yet, so that money can reach your bank account. And what I mean by that is you need to focus on creating content. You need to focus on building your brand and building your community. So, by creating content, that means writing blog posts or taking photos and posting it to your social media. You need to be getting the word out about what you do, so that people can see you and find you.

[00:07:51.130] - Chelsea
And when they see that content and fall in love with you, you want them to actually convert onto your email list. You want them to sign up for your digital products. You want them to join your community, your Facebook group. You are building a community around your brand. And that brand knowing now, and this can change, your brand can grow and evolve over time. But have an idea about what your brand is now and just run with it.

[00:08:15.180] - Chelsea
Just start being you. Start being your brand and creating that content now and know that everything can evolve in time. And once you have those things out in the world, those are your like tentacles out there in the world. All that money that's just waiting to be grabbed, it is going to come to you. So, a thing that we hear a lot is people, when they start a business, they're just so stressed out about money, whether they just don't have enough right now or they're scared they're not going to be successful.

[00:08:42.550] - Chelsea
And that is stopping them from actually creating, which is the most important thing right now, is creating, getting that content out. So, try to remove your thoughts of worry about money except you're getting that money. It's coming to you. Success is inevitable. And also, success is a decision. You have decided today that you will be successful.

[00:09:03.870] - Chelsea
There's nothing else to it. What else are you worried about, Susan? Get to work. Investing in yourself and investing in your business, in your future success. So, what that means is you should be paying attention to what other creators are doing. Pay attention to your, you know your competition.

[00:09:28.500] - Chelsea
Be reading all of these other blogs. Be reading Business Insider, be reading forms, have, whatever your niche is, be a sponge to all of the stuff that is going on in that niche, in that industry, and just educate yourself every single day. Stay on the nose of it. Just know what's going on in your industry and you will be successful in it.

[00:09:51.820] - Chelsea
Just having that, just, you're on it. So that's really important. Also invest in your education through courses. Get a mentor or a coach or take some self study courses, whatever it may be. Just educate yourself.

[00:10:07.150] - Chelsea
If you're in a niche that requires a professional certification, go and do it. Go to school, do what you need to do to be able to be the best that you can in your industry. And on that note of investing in yourself and in your business, come at this with a budget. Like, have some money to invest right now. You don't have to spend thousands and thousands of dollars, but you do need to invest in some software and some tools into some systems that can help you get ahead.

[00:10:36.840] - Chelsea
And it's going to save you time, and potentially, money down the road as well. And time is extremely valuable. So, when you start hanging out with high net worth people, people who are very successful and they're making a lot of money, you will soon realize that time is way more valuable than money. And one of the most simplest ways to do that, to take care of that, is to pay others to help you get ahead. And that could mean hiring a virtual assistant, could be hiring writers or an operator or someone to help with editing your podcast.

[00:11:10.420] - Chelsea
You know, this is a part-time remote type of role that you can offer someone as an independent contractor, does not have to break the bank. But thinking ahead and knowing that every bit of money that you're putting into your business right now and the people and the systems and the processes, that is what's going to help you get ahead faster. So that you can make all of that money that we're working towards. To be successful as an affiliate marketer, get out of your comfort zone. There are so many affiliate marketers out there who are doing really just the bare minimum and that's okay, right? But if you want to be ahead of them, if you want to be ahead of the game and you want to be making the big dollars in your business, and so you should, then you're going to have to go and do the things that most people won't. Go live on your social media.

[00:12:04.060] - Chelsea
If you're afraid of going live or doing like a webinar like this, or a virtual summit, or something like that, start by practicing. You know get on a podcast where you don't have to be on video, where you just be on audio first. Get a couple of those under your belt and then move into doing something like this, like a virtual summit, participating, being in a live webinar, hosting some sort of training for your audience or the people that are like building around your brand and they're falling in love with you, show up and talk to them. And it's probably going to feel really weird at first, like, okay, I put it off for way too long because I was scared. And then when I suddenly was like, I have to just do this.

[00:12:44.830] - Chelsea
I have to just let myself out of the gate and just do it, even though I was scared. Everything in my business shifted and my conversion rates went way up, started making way more affiliate revenue and selling my digital products and selling all the stuff that I was working on. Because people like to buy from people. They like to see your face, they want to hear from you. They want to know that you're a real person. And they absolutely want to know your little personality quirks and things that maybe you're uncomfortable with right now.

[00:13:14.620] - Chelsea
That's what's going to make you memorable. And people are going to think of you and love you and want to know anytime you have something new to offer because they get used to seeing you. Okay? So just like, don't be scared. It's normal to be scared, but do it anyway.

[00:13:30.040] - Chelsea
Get out of your comfort zone. To make more money with affiliate marketing, have an email list. This is a big mistake that a lot of affiliate marketers overlook, is they don't worry. They don't bother with having an email list, they just don't do it. And the people who do do it, they're making more money.

[00:13:51.840] - Chelsea
So, you should start an email list. If you don't have an email list, let today be the day. Just start one. You can even start on a free platform for now. You don't have to pay for it.

[00:14:01.170] - Chelsea
You can just, while you're building up a community, use the free version, the tool, the trials, whatever it is. And then as your community grows, you can upgrade to something better. But start it, just does another thing. Don't be scared to start your email list. You can create an email list today, like that.

[00:14:17.040] - Chelsea
Start sending your newsletter right away, even if only one person is on your list. People often say, well, Chelsea, I have an email course. And people ask me, well, when is too soon to start emailing my list? Like, I created a lead magnet, and then I have two people on my list, but I haven't emailed them ever and it's been six months.

[00:14:34.720] - Chelsea
Whoa. Start emailing them right away. Even if there's only one person on your list, speak in your newsletters as if there are a thousand people on your list, and just be you. And the most important thing is tell stories. Email marketing is all about telling stories, and you are selling through those stories.

[00:14:54.970] - Chelsea
It's not about being salesy or pushing sales on people or making anyone feel bad. You want people to feel inspired and educated and happy when they see your name in their inbox. And you do that by telling great stories through your newsletter. So that's what I want to say about that. And for some of you who may be newer to this, you heard me a second ago, say, lead magnet.

[00:15:16.780] - Chelsea
And what that means is it's just some sort of free resource that you give to your audience in exchange for them signing up to your newsletter, gift for them, giving you their email address and allowing you to contact them. So, things like a lead magnet could be like a PDF, a cheat sheet, a free mini course, whatever it is, whatever works for your niche. You just create something free that will make people excited to want to sign up for your newsletter.

[00:15:44.810] - Chelsea
Okay, here's my tip number seven about how you can make more money as an affiliate marketer. This is a good one. It's very juicy. And not too many people remember to talk about this, and it is to have actual conversations with people. So, it's so easy to just be behind our screens and you know type and just forget that there's actually real people on the other side of that screen.

[00:16:08.960] - Chelsea
This is a big one. If you can have something like a Facebook community, let's say, where you're able to say, hey, like, what if we jump on a call? I'd love to hear what you're working on and actually have offer like a one on one zoom call where you can just chat with people in your audience. Or maybe it's like a group call. You could have office hours or something once in a while, where people in your community can all get on a zoom call with you and you can just get to know them.

[00:16:36.100] - Chelsea
They can get to know you. You can offer some tips. You know they can ask questions. And just having those real conversations is going to make your success as an affiliate marketer just way ahead of anyone who would just not even bother to go that extra mile.

[00:16:57.040] - Chelsea
Tip number eight, and this is going to be freeing for some of you, you do not have to be on every social media in fact, you shouldn't. I would really recommend that you just pick one wherever your ideal customer is hanging out and you just focus your efforts there. Don't worry about being on every single social platform. What you can do is you can sign up for you know Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, and just reserve your brand names. You can have an account there and reserve your brand name.

[00:17:29.100] - Chelsea
But you don't need to feel like you have to be publishing content every single day to all of those. In fact, just pick one right now, and create content for the audience on that one platform. You can also repurpose all that content, right? You can just have it automated through automation tools where let's say, you're just focusing on Instagram, you publish stuff to Instagram, you can have it automatically go to your Twitter, and then show up on your Facebook page, and all that stuff just happening on the back end of the business. But it's not like an active thing that you feel like, you have to have all of these conversations and have these audiences all over the place because that honestly, can really, really affect people.

[00:18:05.970] - Chelsea
Especially, if you are trying to focus on creating content, which again, that's the most important thing. Remember, creating your valuable quality content that is selling all of your offers, all of your affiliate offers. If you're too busy trying to keep up with all these different social media platforms, you're going to burn out. Okay? I see it a lot.

[00:18:25.410] - Chelsea
So, free yourself, you do not have to be on all the social media platforms. Just pick one, get that up and running. And then if you feel like you can take on another one in six months to a year, do it. Just allow yourself to be freed of that social media commitment.

[00:18:43.010] - Chelsea
This is another big one, okay, they're all big ones. But this is so important. Don't let failure bring you down. And most importantly, don't let failure stop you from what you're trying to do. Failure is a totally normal part of success.

[00:18:59.060] - Chelsea
It would be weird if you started something just right out of the box and you had like just no failures, no issues, everything just was completely smooth sailing every single time. If you have failures, great. You can learn from that. Take those setbacks, take those things that feel awful in the moment and just use it to propel you to create even better content, even better products. Just build on what you are doing, and take all of those failures as lessons because that is just really going to help you grow.

[00:19:33.410] - Chelsea
And on that note too, I do want to say that no matter what, if you can channel, if you're feeling like that disappointment or anger about something failing, channel that back into your business. Or maybe, maybe you need to actually look inward and look if your goal is still what your goals are now, the goals that you set six months ago. Maybe that's not what you're trying to achieve now. Maybe your path needs to have a bit of a detour. And that is also really, really important part of success too.

[00:20:07.140] - Chelsea
So don't give up. Don't let failure get you down. Instead, use that failure to be better, do better, and you're going to get ahead. Because there's going to be haters.

[00:20:17.130] - Chelsea
There's going to be people who don't get it, don't care, you know just not interested. And that is good. We don't want to speak to everyone. We don't want everyone in our community. We just want a few right people in our community.

[00:20:33.180] - Chelsea
And we want the few right people to buy the stuff that we love. We want to make sure that those people see the right content at the right time, so that they can learn about the products through our affiliate content. Right? We don't need to sell to everyone. We just need to build a small brand of superfans, people who really love you and love what you do.

[00:20:53.610] - Chelsea
That's the most important thing. So, when you feel like, people are saying notso nice things, you know online, just ignore it, delete it, move on. Or even better, keep it there. But respond in your most professional, level-headed way, so that other people can see just your normal person, right? And your fans will support you no matter what.

[00:21:19.010] - Chelsea
And now my final tip. And then I'm going to give you something for free, really awesome, so stay tuned. My final tip is when you are working as an affiliate marketer and you are monetizing your content with affiliate links, do not put all of your bags, do not put all of your eggs in one basket.

[00:21:40.030] - Chelsea
Because things change, okay? Commission rates change. Affiliate programs, sometimes they will close their program altogether. Do not focus all of your efforts onto one affiliate program. In fact, you should just focus on a couple that really makes sense for your audience and for your brand.

[00:22:00.750] - Chelsea
And know that when you can actually reach out to your affiliate manager, you can actually ask for increased commission rates. Like rates that are not publicly posted anywhere. If you're creating great content and you're getting conversions for a brand and you've been doing so for maybe a couple of months, heck yes. Go and reach out, and actually ask if they can give you a commission increase. And most of the time they will because they want people who are eager to promote their content.

[00:22:31.810] - Chelsea
They want to, you know you're making them happy. They want to make you happy too, because they want to retain you. So do not just focus on one affiliate program. And also when you start to get into this, don't just mush all everything into one site. If you're interested in all different types of niches, then you should probably have multiple niche sites and be able to monetize different sites.

[00:22:56.170] - Chelsea
So that let's say that an algorithm update happens and it tanks traffic on one of your sites, you know that you have a couple other sites that are still bringing in revenue for your business. And on that note of not putting all your eggs in one basket, I also want to say affiliate marketing is only one revenue stream. You should also have other things going on on all of your sites that also bring in revenue in addition to that affiliate revenue. So, things like having your own product for sale, your own digital product for sale, things like having display ads, being in a great ad network and having ads come up on your site SEO. When people click their ads, you get a little bit of some money from that too.

[00:23:36.270] - Chelsea
Just thinking about creative ways that you can generate revenue from your site in multiple ways. Now, on that note, I have some really cool things to share with you. And thank you everybody for sticking around and watching my session. I hope that it was helpful. So, I want to give you a free gift for sticking around.

[00:23:53.800] - Chelsea
Go to herpaperoute.com/black and you can get a free copy of my affiliate program list of recurring commission affiliate programs. That means that you join their program and you make a sale. So, someone purchases the thing you recommended, and because the thing that they bought, they're paying for it every month. Like something like software, you are getting that commission every single month from that one customer that you referred.

[00:24:24.930] - Chelsea
That's called a recurring affiliate program, and there's not too many of them out there, but I created a list of the ones that I use and love. So, go to herpapero.com/black. You can get a free copy of that, and that's also going to get you into my community, so that we can hang out more and we can chat and we can open up this conversation.
