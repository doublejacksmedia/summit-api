All right, everyone. Welcome to How to Legally and Protect Your Online Business & Blog. This is going over some of the stuff that once you started blogging a little bit, you should definitely be aware of this is geared towards intermediate bloggers that have been, are just starting. If you are just starting, make sure you go watch the beginner session. Not that you can't watch this if you're just starting, but I want to make sure you cover the basics in the beginner session first. This is the a little bit more advanced stuff. Who am I? I'm Liz Stapleton. I'm an attorney. I've spoken on the topic of legally protecting your online business at both in-person, conferences, as well as online conferences like FinCon, the Rebel Boss Summit, Niche Investor Summit, and more. I'm a blogger myself, and I'm the host of the summit, if you didn't know that already. You're going to be seeing a lot of me this week, and hopefully, I'll get to know a lot of you as well. I'm really excited to share this information. I started blogging back in 2014 in the personal finance space. I started sharing about the legal side of blogging in 2017, 2018 around there because I saw a lot of scaremongering while I was in this space myself.

[00:01:13.400] - Liz Stapleton, Host
It's just not necessary. So this stuff is super important, but it doesn't have to be scary or hard. We're going to approach it in a way that makes it simple and easy to understand so that you can figure the right steps to take for you. So before we start, I do want to encourage you to just focus. I talk really fast. I'm going to cover a lot of information. I'm going to keep it short and sweet. Just focus for the 20-ish minutes, maybe 25, and turn off your phone, close your tabs, and just be present. Take notes. It's going to be good stuff. Also, before we start, a little disclaimer. While I'm an attorney, I'm not your attorney. Also, before we start, a quick disclaimer. While I'm an attorney, I'm not your attorney. This is not legal advice. This is for informational and educational purposes only. Hopefully, with that information, you'll be able to figure out what the right next step for you is and the right questions to ask. You need to talk to an attorney, but I am not responsible for whatever actions you do or don't take based on what you learn here.

[00:02:11.400] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Like I said, informational educational purposes only. I'm not your attorney. That's it. All right, moving on. Let's go ahead and put your mind at ease. Here's what we're going to be covering today. We're going to talk about if you should be an LLC, as well as the BOI reporting requirements that went into effect in 2024. We're going to talk about the basics of copyright and trademark, when to use AI disclosures, the legal requirements of email marketing, list building. This is going to be a real quick thing because I could actually do an entire session just on that, and I have. But we're going to just cover really quickly some of the most important things. We're going to talk about what terms and conditions are and if you need them. Let's go ahead and get started. Take a deep breath. Remember, the little stuff is important. It doesn't have to be scary or hard. It helps if you think of it as the understanding that most of these laws came into effect because people are being sketchy. I know if you're here, you're not sketchy because I don't roll that way, and the people that hang out with me don't tend to roll that way.

[00:03:08.440] - Liz Stapleton, Host
If you are thinking of it as just being open and honest with your audience, then you're already halfway there. Let's get started. Do you need to be an LLC? An LLC stands for a limited liability corporation, and it's a state-based entity. If you want to be an LLC, and this is in the US, you have to go to your state Secretary of State website and register it to be an LLC. It's a limited liability company, like I said. Single-member LLCs, you're generally taxed the same way as a sole proprietor, but what it can do is it can protect your personal asset. If the company gets sued, generally, they can't go after your personal assets. It does require separation of your business finances and your personal finances. You want to make sure you are keeping those separate, you're not intermingling, that you have a separate business account, which you will you need to get an EIN for. We talked about that a little bit in Katherine Pomerantz's session, which is also going live today. But you pay yourself out of the business account, and then you pay whatever bills you have with your personal account. LLCs, I think LLCs are easy to create.

[00:04:15.860] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Like I said, you go to your Secretary of State's website and look for corporate filing. Usually, there's directions. There is a wide variety of how good Secretary of State's websites are between the 50 states. Some are really awesome, some are not so awesome. Some states, it costs $500 for an LLC, others, it costs $30. So it varies greatly. Some other business formations that you might consider, but you probably need to use in a trying to help you create, could be a Corporation or partnership. A single member LLC can typically be on your own. Since it is state-based, if you want to file in another state, it would be considered a foreign LLC in that state. So just keeping that in mind. Now, If you are not a US resident, some states do make it easier for non-residents to set up an LLC. Some of the advantages that you might consider BOIng that would be credibility, being able to create a PayPal account, because sometimes PayPal is really particular, doesn't let you create a business account or something if you're located in certain places. That could be a reason you might want to do that. Again, everyone's a little bit different.

[00:05:25.040] - Liz Stapleton, Host
But one of the reasons it's important to know or to consider it is because if you do file as a corporate agency, whether that's an LLC, a Corporation, a partnership, then you are going to need to comply with BOI reporting requirements. BOI stands for beneficial owner information. Again, it came into effect to require shady people to stop being shady. It came to effect January 1, 2024. Like I said, while Corporation filing can vary greatly state to state, the BOI helps to set a clear federal standard for incorporation practices. Basically, it wanted to know who is benefiting from this business, who is getting paid from this business? Because I'm sure we've all seen news or you see it on TV all the time, TV shows where it's like, well, it was owned by some shell Corporation that was owned by another Corporation trying We're going to find out who actually owns it in the TV show. It's like a whole thing. With BOI, that has to be a report to the federal government. Who needs to file? Business is registered in the US. An example would be an LLC. If you're just a sole you haven't registered as an entity with the state that you're located in, then you don't need to file a BOI.

[00:06:36.110] - Liz Stapleton, Host
But if you have filed an application to form a corporate entity under the laws of the state or filed for a similar entity formed above the laws of a foreign country to do business in the US by filing a document of a Secretary of State, maybe it's a foreign policy, but like a foreign foreign, not just state foreign, then you would need to file a BOI report. The BOI report info is considered sensitive information. This is what you need to file. It's not a lot. It's not hard. You need your name, date of birth, address, a unique identifying number, so passport or driver's license. When you said it's not publicly available. It will be directly available only to authorize government authority subject to safeguards and control. It has regular auditing, that thing. When do you need to file? If you established your business before January 1, 2024, then you had to have filed by January first, 2025. Obviously, we're watching this. It is the end of January, 2025. If you have not filed, you need to get on that. If you formed in 2024, you had 90 days from the date of your formation to file your BOI report.

[00:07:48.610] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Then, I have to double check, so I'm recording this, guys, at the end of 2024. But the law itself, it's supposed to be you need to file a BOI report within, I think, 30 days of registering your business. If you're registering a business in 2025 and your secretary state should have information of, hey, you need to file this, too. When I redid or renewed my stuff in 2024, I didn't see that. But again, every state is a little bit different. Maybe some states are better than others. If you're filing as a business, make sure you file a BOI report, too. Even if you're behind, better late than ever. They want people to stop being shady. If you're filing stuff, you at least are showing it. You're trying not to. You just say, I didn't know beforehand. No one's out to get you. They really are after people that are trying to flaunt not filing things like that. It's not to say you can't be penalized because there are consequences for not filing. They're both criminal and civil penalties. You could be fined up to $500 for each day the violation continues. It can't be more than $10,000, but that's still a lot of money.

[00:08:55.100] - Liz Stapleton, Host
You could also potentially be in prison for not more than two years or both. File. If you are a registered business in the state where you're located or you are from another country and you're registered in a state, make sure you are filing the BOI report. It's not hard. You just go to fincen.Gov/BOI. It takes five 10 minutes. It's completely free to file. If, like me, like most businesses, you're the sole owner, it's like you and one partner, it's really simple. If you have a complex business structure with lots of potential owners and things then it gets a little more complicated. You might need to pull in some help. But for most of us, pretty simple. Fincen.Gov/BOI. There's actually a lot of great resources on that website as well if you're confused. Okay, so let's go ahead and talk We're going to talk about some intellectual property, the basis of copyright and trademark. We're just going to cover the basics because intellectual property is a very specialized area of law and is not an area that I've specialized in. Nicole Cheri-Oden has spoken at this summit multiple times in the past. She does do copyright and trademark.

[00:10:00.780] - Liz Stapleton, Host
She's awesome. I would say, go check out her stuff if you're looking for someone to actually file these for you. But I am going to just touch on the basics so you can decide. Again, figure out what's going to work best for you. Trademark's purpose is to protect a brand's reputation and inform the customer for what they're getting. When you see the Nike swoosh, you know it's going to be a really good shoe that runs a little narrow. If Joe Schmo, who slapped together a shoe with cardboard and a little glue, put a Nike swoosh on it, you'd be really confused. Just because a trademark can be a mark like the Nike swoosh, it could be a textmark, but it has to be distinguished. There's Dove Chocolate and there's Dove Soap. They're the same name, but they're very different products, and they're both trademarked. So trademarked applies to category, not just the name. That's why you should really always hire an attorney if you want to get something trademarked because it's, again, very specialized. You have to know the categories, things like that. But like I said, there's Lexus, the car, and Lexis Nexis, the legal research company, which they're spelled a little bit differently, but they certainly sound the same.

[00:11:12.240] - Liz Stapleton, Host
They're completely different. There's no chance of confusing one for the other. Same with chocolate or soap. If you go to the store to get soap and you want dove, you're not going to accidentally buy chocolate. I mean, you might accidentally buy chocolate for another reason, but you're not going to get mixed up from the dove aspect. Copyright is making sure you're respectful of what others have created and making sure that the stuff you created isn't being stolen. What's exciting is you don't have to register to claim your copyright or trademark. They apply automatically. But you can't use the R symbol without registering, and there's certain benefits to registering such as statutory damages if someone violates your copyright or violates your trademark. On the flip side, if you're not sure if you can If you want to do something, maybe you want to do a roundup or something, include some recipes, ask. You can't just borrow an image from someone's site, and because you link to it and give attribution, that's still a copyright violation. You have to make sure you have the proper permission. When in doubt, ask. A lot of bloggers will include something in their terms and conditions, especially if it's like food or craft blogger that tends to get included in roundups of like, Hey, you can borrow one image per post so long as you link good proper attribution.

[00:12:29.540] - Liz Stapleton, Host
So some will They actually say it in their terms and conditions because they don't want to deal with a lot of requests in their inbox. You can always check there. But again, when in doubt, ask. The purpose is to protect things you've created from being stolen and vice versa. You don't want to unintentionally infringe on someone else's copyright. One thing that's been shifting in this area a lot, though, is AI. In Thaler versus Perlmutter, it's possible I'm not saying that, human authorship is the bedrock requirement of copyright. Basically, this case answered whether AI work can be copyrighted. Basically, the test is whether the work is one of human authorship with the computer or other device, merely being an assisting instrument, or whether the traditional elements of authorship in the work, that's literary, artistic, musical expression, or elements of selection, arrangement, et cetera, were actually conceived and executed not by the man, but by the machine. Let's take a couple of examples. Let's say you give AI some keywords and ask it to write a blog post. If you take the content produced by the AI and post it as is, it's not going to be protected by copyright.

[00:13:38.470] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Anyone can steal that from you. There's nothing you do because it's AI. It's not copyright protected because in the eyes of the law, you didn't write it and machine did. Now, if you take that same content, produced it, it's a rough draft, and you go through and you make significant edits and you rearrange and you clean up information and make sure it's all factually correct in site to things, then that can be copyright-protected. Because there's the elements of human authorship, of going through making it your own. It has artistic elements of selection, arrangement, things like that. You can use AI as an assistant, but it cannot be the primary thing producing the content. Does that make sense? Like I said, you can use AI when writing blog posts, but you can't only use AI. The thing is, I use AI when I write stuff. I like to use AI on some of my sites. It's about a super duper rough draft or just an overall outline to get me started. The goal is for me when I'm using AI is to get words on a page so that I can avoid staring at a blank page, so to avoid blank page syndrome.

[00:14:56.900] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Then I'll go through multiple rounds of edits and formatting before I get the final version. In that case, a lot of the final content is my own making. I'm just using AI as an assistant, so it should be protected by copyright. All right. Images are where we get a little bit more complicated. It's about the same if you have an image generated and make significant edits, it's possible to have copyright protection. That being said, I think there's going to be a lot more issues with images in terms of copyright and how AI tools train on them. In my opinion, this is my opinion, we haven't seen this come through, but I think artists are going to have an easier time proving. Authors have struggled, but I think artists will have an easier time proving infringement by AI companies and the future of AI image creation will involve potentially licensing deals. Because I've literally seen AI generate images where you can be like, someone's putting a prompt in, do it in the style of this artist, and you can see a warped version of their signature. I think it's going to be much easier for artists to prove infringement.

[00:16:00.930] - Liz Stapleton, Host
My concern is if an AI company is found to have infringed on a visual artist copyright, what does that mean for the image you created? Will you be required to remove it? Will you be required to pay a fee? We just don't know. Personally, I don't touch image generators with a 10-foot pole. That being said, I think AI editing images is great. Background removers, things like that. That's all involving AI, and I think that's fantastic. You're starting with an image that you own or have license to own. Now, if you can't use AI when it comes to images, it's just a little bit more complicated. If it's generated the image, then it's not going to be copyright protected. In that Thaler case, that was actually, someone built the AI to generate an image. Even though they built the machine that then produced the image, built the machine, it was still considered not copyright because it didn't have human authorship. Just keep that in mind. Use it your own risk. Use of AI. The AI Act, which is a proposed e-regulation, and I think is going to set the standard the way GDPR did with data protection back in 2018.

[00:17:13.100] - Liz Stapleton, Host
I believe it went into effect in May or June of last year. Most of the act focuses on businesses that create AI tools, so most of it's not going to apply to content creators. But there is this one section in it that I think everyone should be familiar with. It's this term term called synthetic content. You can see I've quoted it here on the screen. A variety of AI systems can generate large quantities of synthetic content that becomes increasingly hard for humans to distinguish from human-generated and authentic content. It may not be required to comply, but again, it goes towards transparency that you might need to disclose when you're using AI. If there's going to be a significant impact on the integrity and trust in the information ecosystem, that's where synthetic content we've all heard of deep fakes, and that can be really confusing and you're like, Wait a second. It may require disclosure. Very similar to what of course I said regarding the ability to cooperate content involving AI, is also appropriate as similar disclosure obligation in relation to AI-generated or manipulated text to the extent is published with the purpose of informing the public on matters of public interest, unless the AI-generated content has undergone the process of human review or editorial control in a natural or legal person holds editorial We're responsible for the publication of content.

[00:18:33.280] - Liz Stapleton, Host
If it's copyright-protected, then you may not need to disclose, but it doesn't hurt to just be transparent in how you use AI or don't use AI. It's also a great way in disclosing, staking your claim on your copyright. One example I like to share, Layla, who is going to be one of our fantastic panelists during the summit. In her emails, she had this thing that said, This is drafted with care and occasional typos by me, not AI. Like I said, in addition to transparency, when you're sharing how you're using AI to create content, a disclosure regarding AI can demonstrate copyright ownership. It can put people on notice that they can't scrape your content because it's copyright-protected. It just helps to distinguish what is copyrighted content and what isn't. All righty, we got to really get moving now. Let's go ahead. We're going to talk about email marketing and list building because we don't want you to get kicked off of your email marketing service, whether that's Kit, whether it's Flodesk. There's so many out there now. I do love Kit. But basically, there are some laws that govern this. And CANspam is the big one that requires you to allow people to opt out from receiving emails from you.

[00:19:49.670] - Liz Stapleton, Host
This is why you need email marketing service because you can't just be using your Gmail account to email a bunch of people because they need to be able to opt out. GDPR requires specific consent for the types of content you send. So product updates versus newsletter, just because someone bought a product doesn't mean they agree to be on your newsletter and receive other marketing messages. Just keeping in mind, those are the two big things and just practicality. Gmail is not going to let you send an email to a thousand people. Here are some things you want to make sure you do. You want to make sure you're getting consent for the emails you want to send. And double opt-in doesn't necessarily work. So ConvertKit, which I do love, or Kit, as it's now known, it was known for being created by a blogger for bloggers. Back then this thing called a lead magnet or content upgrade, which still what it's called and still works well, but it works a little differently, was great because you'd say, Hey, give me your email. I'll give you this thing. The way Kit did it is their double opt-in email, their confirmation email, in order to download the thing, they had to click the button that confirmed that they wanted to receive the email.

[00:20:58.380] - Liz Stapleton, Host
So the double opt-in and deliver three was like a two for one. But that is not necessarily compliant with how GDPR is laid out. You just have to be very careful with that. I don't have time to go into the details. I do have a free GDPR guide that I will make sure to include below this video, but just keep that in mind. Something else you need to do is you need to use a real address in your email marketing service, so you can't use a fake address. You have to use a real address or to comply with the CanSPAM act. Now, it doesn't have to be your house address. You could get a PO Box, Kit, I know lets you use their address. If you've ever seen the 15 Cherry Street, Seattle or whatever, that's someone using Kit's address because they let their customers do that. But you do need a real address. Okay, moving on. I think finally, this last thing we're going to talk about is understanding what terms and conditions are and if you need them. Terms and conditions are basically your way of saying, My site, my rules, and if you don't like it, you can It also lays out various payment and refund policies that people should agree to if they're going to purchase from you.

[00:22:07.150] - Liz Stapleton, Host
But it's laying down the law of your site. It's your domain, literally. Some of the things you might cover in there is a limitation of liability. You're not perfect, neither is your site. You don't get sued because you didn't tell your reader that. You could also decide where to throw down. If someone's going to come after you, you can say, It's got to happen in my home state or wherever. I'm in Washington State, I would not want to have to go defend a lawsuit in Florida or Delaware or whatever. You can say, You got to come to me if we're going to have to do this. Those are some of the things that you would cover. Refunds, like I said, limitation of liability They decided where to throw down, jurisdiction, things like that. That is very short and sweet, very basic information that you guys should be aware of. There's a few of the things, but we are going to run out of time. I do want to, like I said, I take 20, 20, five minutes. We're going to do a quick recap. This is what you guys learned in this session. You learned the legal requirements of email marketing and list building.

[00:23:06.200] - Liz Stapleton, Host
We talked about terms of additions, what they are, and hopefully you have some idea that if you need them, they're going to be super important. If you sell traditional products, you may be able to hold up on them before that, depending. It varies. We talked about why you don't necessarily have to file for copyright and trademark. We talked about how an LLC might be beneficial and filing your BOI report. We also touched on AI disclosures and why you might want to include them. Now, we're going to talk about putting it all into action. If you don't already have these things on your site, which you want a privacy policy, a terms and conditions page, and disclosures and disclaimers page, most likely, then you need to get them. Here's a rundown of what's included in your privacy policy. There is a default WordPress privacy policy. Lastly, checked includes this stuff that's in white, but not this other stuff. This is what you should include in your terms and conditions, revisions and errors, use license, some of the stuff we have time to get into in detail, but we touched on some of it. There's no default terms and conditions page, unfortunately.

[00:24:13.810] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Then disclosures and disclaimers page, again, we touched on this a little bit, but not a lot. I cover it more in the beginner session. So even if you've been blogging for a while, these concepts are new to you, go watch the beginner session. It's also very short and sweet, but it gets to the point. And again, there's no default. So what are your options, really? Do you have to hire an attorney? And no, you don't. The best option, if you can afford it, because I know hiring an attorney can be cost-prohibitive, and I say that as someone who does not offer these services, so I'm not looking for you to hire me because I don't do it. I don't want to. I want to help you, but I don't want to run a law firm. If you can afford it, absolutely hire an attorney. That's always going to be your best bet. The next best option is going to be to grab legal templates from someone who understands the online space and is an attorney and can write those. I'm not going to now go into a big long pitch about mine. Yes, I have some, but there's a lot out there, fortunately.

[00:25:14.630] - Liz Stapleton, Host
When I started teaching on this, there were not a lot of us, and now there's more and more, and it's fantastic. I do love mine. I do think they're great. I am going to share screenshots of what people have said about them. They do come with a generator. They're awesome, and I have a special deal for you guys this week. But I'm just going to scroll through these pages real quick, and we're going to get to here where I'm going to say, Thank you so much for watching. I do have a free gift for you guys. I normally charge about $30 bucks for this, but it's my Smart Bloggers Guidebook to the Legal Side of Blogging. You can grab access to it for free this week only while this summit is live. Elizabethstapleton.Com/go/2025bbs. It goes over what we talked about as well as what I'm going over in the other legal sessions. It's just, like I said, a sessions. It's just a little smart guidebook for you to be able to reference a few questions and need to figure out your right next steps. If you guys have questions, I'm in the chat below and I'm happy to do my best to answer them.

[00:26:12.330] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Have a great rest of the summit and I will be seeing you guys around.
