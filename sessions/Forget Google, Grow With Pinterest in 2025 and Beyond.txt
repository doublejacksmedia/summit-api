Hey there Blogger, Breakthrough Summit. It's Nadalie Bardo, your Pinterest Coach here, and I'm so excited to bring to you this brand new training. We're going to start with talking about why you really need Pinterest. This is how to forget Google and grow with Pinterest in 2025 and beyond. We need to talk about this. Major changes with the Google search algorithm in 2024. Sadly, many sites have lost all, most, or some of their organic search traffic. Here are just some snippets of what's been going on. You can see this Reddit post that says, I lost 95% of my traffic. That is major. As you can see right here, I have lost between 50% to 60% of my traffic depending on the day. I have definitely been hit by the search algorithm. However, thankfully, because of Pinterest, I have been able to maintain the majority of my passive income I was earning from my ad network. We have so many questions about this. We cannot understand how major these changes have been. What does this mean for us? To be clear, SEO is not dead, but Google search might be. With 91% of all search, Google is not the only search engine.

[00:01:44.250] - Nadalie Bardo
It's just the biggest. Okay, for now, anyways, there's lawsuits in the pipeline. People seem to be going for Google. We'll see how this all shakes out. Will Google search traffic ever recover? This might be a question you have. Honestly, I literally don't know, and I don't think anyone does. I don't even think Google knows. What can we do about it? Is there hope? You need to diversify your traffic sources, especially if Google is your primary source of leads, of clicks to your site. What are our options? Let's go over them. We have got Instagram, very much a influencer, hashtag-based platform. A lot of people are complaining about how the algorithm changes are really killing leads. We also have TikTok, so to be successful there, you've really got to be okay with doing video. We also have YouTube, which is also a search engine. It's also owned by Google. But once again, you've got to be good with creating video. We also have Facebook We all know that organic reach on Facebook is pretty much nonexistent. Instagram, Facebook, Meta, you're definitely going to have to run ads. We also have X. I don't know what's going on there.

[00:03:15.360] - Nadalie Bardo
I don't want to know. We also have Pinterest. Pinterest operates way differently than your other options, and I want to break it down for you. Your most reliable option is now Pinteresr. Why Pinterest? Not Instagram, TikTok, or Facebook. I want to break it down for you. Reason number one, Pinterest is a visual search engine. So remember, SEO is not dead. We're just moving away from Google. It's not social media. We're talking keywords, not hashtags. Plus, absolutely no engagement required. No going live either. You don't need to be social on Pinterest to be successful. There are 5 billion monthly searches on Pinterest and over 500 million active monthly users on Pinterest. The platform is growing. With 96 of Pinterest's top searches are unbranded. What does this mean for you? It means Pinterest is not dominated by big brands and influencers, like you might see on other platforms like Instagram. You  know also how Google had become. The last few years, pretty much every search term was dominated by those huge publications. Even if it wasn't the best content, it would outrank. Reason number 2, Pinterest pins have the longest lifespan for posts, meaning you can create a pin once and it has the best chance of continual long-term traffic.

[00:04:58.550] - Nadalie Bardo
Pinterest pins can live Live, and by Live, we mean it's still getting views and clicks and engagement for four months to years. This pin, my number one pin for saved this month was added to Pinterest in 2017. Or this pin, which was added in 2020 and it got over 1,000 clicks this month. Yes, like how Google used to be before, where you You would create it, you would achieve the ranking, and you would just continue to get traffic. But better because you never have to update them. You never have to update your pins. Reason number 3, Pinterest users are trained to click and shop. Did you know, Pinterest users are more likely to purchase from you? Or that 75% of weekly Pinterest users say they're always shopping. And 50% of Pinterest users see the platform as a shopping destination. Also, one in three, Pinterest shoppers have an average annual income of 100K or more. There's more. Plus, Pinterest users spend 80% more per month than on other platforms. This is where the cash is. Shoppers on Pinterest spend twice as much as shoppers on other platforms. Okay, buckle in. Sounds great. That's why you need to focus on Pinterest and forget Google.

[00:06:39.580] - Nadalie Bardo
Here's how. Step one, you need to design Pinterest pins. Let's talk basics. Types of pins. We have got image pins, and we have got video pins, and we used to have idea pins, but thankfully, these have now been recategorized as video pins. We're talking about organic pins. These are unpaid pins, not ads. Let's talk pin dimensions. This is the size of the pins you'll be creating. For image pins, they are going to be vertical 2 by 3 ratio. Essentially, that's 1,000 by 1,500 pixels, JPEGs or PNGs. For video pins, we want to make sure they're also vertical 9 by 16 ratio, which is the same size as shorts, as reels, as TikTok videos. That's 1080 by 1920 pixels, and they want to be saved as MP4 videos. You can design pins with a free graphic design tool like Canva. Canva is amazing. Use it to design your pins. Let's take a look at this. For example, I really encourage you to create some high converting templates that you can easily use to update and create multiple new pins. Essentially, when you have your templates, you're just going to be swapping in new text and changing the images.

[00:08:08.940] - Nadalie Bardo
Just like me as I'm updating these pins for a new blog post, it took me about a minute, a pin, to design seven new pins for my content. It just is so much easier. This is the post that I'm designing for. It's so much easier when you're working from templates because you are not staring at a blank screen. You're not wasting time trying to figure out what should my pins look like. You have these templates that you can easily use and update for your content in just a few clicks. That's a look at Canva. Pro tip, you're going to save time by using pin templates. Just swap out the text and the images like this. We can see here, these are my pins. You can see I'm working I'm working with seven templates that I update for every single post that I have. I encourage you to not copy anyone else's designs. It's low-key theft and very uncool. You can purchase templates or use the ones they have in Canva. So don't start from scratch. Once you have your templates, update them quickly and easily. For example, you would just update your templates. We're not starting from scratch.

[00:09:30.520] - Nadalie Bardo
Here are a few more examples. You're just going to update your templates for your new content. A pro tip, design pins that look like ranking pins for the keyword you're targeting. For example, when we search Amsterdam, you can see that a lot of these pins look very similar. I've just blocked out the ads. That's what the spaces are. Or for this one, on smart goals, you can see all the ranking pins are very similar, including one of my own. You can see here for this travel bag, all the ranking pins look similar. So pretty pins are just part of it. Step two, you need to optimize pins for SEO. Let's break it down. Like any search engine, keywords are the language of Pinterest, and they're how your pins get found in search. You first need to find the right keywords to target on Pinterest. Then optimize your pins with that keyword in all the right places. This is how you search. We are going to use Pinterest Trends. That's one tool where you can access. This is a free tool accessible with any Pinterest business account. Or you can use the Pinterest search bar to find keywords.

[00:10:50.870] - Nadalie Bardo
For example, here are some pins that are ranking for how to meditate for beginners. You want to make sure once you find When you're in that keyword, you're going to add it to your pin. Let's take a look at one of my pins that's ranking. It's called How to Meditate for Beginners. I'm going to show you where I would put these keywords. For example, you want to make sure it's in your pin title. Pin titles and pin descriptions are almost like the open graph title or metadata you would add to any of your product or blog post pages. We also want to make sure it's in our description. It's in our linking URL. Out. If it's a product or if it's a blog post, whatever you're linking to, you want that keyword in the URL. It's also right on my image, how to meditate. It's also the board my pin is saved to. If you're not familiar with Pinterest boards, think of them as folders for your content. However you organize your products or your content, you want that to be reflected on Pinterest using keywords for those boards or folder names. It's in our alt text, and it's also going to be in the topic tags that are added to our pins.

[00:12:11.040] - Nadalie Bardo
Topic tags are like modern version of hashtags. They're predefined by Pinterest and you add them to your pins. That's not all. Use the keywords to guide you in your content and product creation. Where possible, use trend graph data to tell you When to Create What. This is a trend graph that you can find right inside Pinterest Trends. It's a completely free tool. We can see for this keyword, which is meditation, that search peaks right in January. By using this data, it's going to help you to plan your content and to plan your products or your promotions. Here's another example for small business. We can see right here, it peaks in around August. You would be creating content ahead of August so that it gets on Pinterest in time. I would usually count forward around 2-3 months. Using trend data, you're able to predict when keywords are going to peak. Here's another example for you where you can see that sometimes keywords have a peak, but sometimes it's a very subtle one and it's more consistent throughout the year. Either way, use this data to inform when you create what. Use your research to create content like blog posts, podcasts, YouTube videos, shorts, and products.

[00:13:42.760] - Nadalie Bardo
Now, let's finish up. You ready? Step three, save or schedule pins. It's time to get your pins on Pinterest. Ways to Pin. Okay, on one side, you can pin directly on Pinterest itself as the website website, but you could also pin with a Pinterest scheduler like Tailwind, for example. If you're using the Pinterest website, you can only pin 30 days in advance. You would be able to pin 30 days from the day you're posting, and you can only schedule a maximum of 50 pins at a time. With Tailwind, the limits are based on your own plan. For example, if you're on the base plan, maybe you're only able to schedule schedule 30 pins a month, but you're able to schedule those pins out as far as you would like, and like Tailwind has a free plan. It just depends on your needs, your budget, and which of these tools you want to pin with. It's less about which way is better and more about what works for you. What works for your budget? What works for your workflow? Do you want to only schedule 30 days out at a time? Do you want to get farther ahead?

[00:15:00.110] - Nadalie Bardo
It's up to you. But it's more about following the best practices for pinning than how you pin. It's very important that you don't break the rules. There are many unwritten rules you need to know and follow to be successful on Pinterest. Otherwise, it won't work for you and you could get in trouble with Pinterest. But don't worry, don't panic. It's okay. All right, are you listening up? Are you listening up? Here are the basics that you need to know. Number one, pin at least one new pin per day on Pinterest to start. That's one brand new image that's never been added to Pinterest before. Start with at least one. When you have capacity, you can increase to two or three. I would never pin more than, say, seven. Seven seems like a lot when it comes to Pinterest these days. Number two, never repin your pins again. Save them only once. Once. You do all the work upfront, you design an amazing graphic, you make sure you've optimized it, you save it to the best board, and you walk away. That's it. You only pin it once. You're going to wait seven days to share the same link again on Pinterest.

[00:16:17.240] - Nadalie Bardo
We're not repinning identical pins, but you can go save an additional pin to the same link. If you wait seven days, let that link cool off before you add it We don't want to appear scammy or spammy on Pinterest. You should design multiple pins per link and spread them out on Pinterest. That's why I encourage you to have templates that you can easily use to update for all of the new links you create, like this. Maybe week one this goes out, and then week two, and then week three, and then week four, and week five. Five, and week six. You get it? Then week seven, and then week eight, and then week nine. A pro tip. Start with five or so pins for your new links. If it as well, then design more pins. Say, for example, you are creating blog posts. You can start with just a few pin templates for your blog post. If your pin takes off or if that particular link is very popular, then go design more pins. For example, if this is the top pin on your account, great. Go design more pins and space them out. For example, we had one pin.

[00:17:43.440] - Nadalie Bardo
It did fairly well. We're going to go design multiple pins per link and space those out seven days to help to build traction because we validated that, yes, this content is what people want. People are clicking on it, so let's give them more. Then, if you're lucky, you'll have multiple pins ranking in search for the same keyword, meaning that you're going to get even more clicks. Remember this screenshot? These are my pins in the first and the third position, meaning that if maybe one pin isn't appealing, maybe the second one is. Also, if you scroll throughout the results, you'll see even more of my pins. Okay? You all get it? I hope so.
