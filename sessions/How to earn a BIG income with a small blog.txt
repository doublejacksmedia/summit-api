Hello and welcome to this presentation about how to earn a big income with a small blog. My name is Leanne Scott. I teach passive income strategy to bloggers, and I'm here today to show you you that you do not need a million followers or a zillion page views in order to be successful. What you do need is a strategy, and that's going to be what we're going to talk about today.

[00:00:40.930] - Leanne
So, I started my career as a doctor and I was getting quite stressed. I didn't have much in the way of work life balance. And so, I took four months off, went on a sabbatical, went to South America, and I started a travel blog. And I quickly realized just how much I loved travel blogging. But in particular, I really, really got into passive income strategy and affiliate marketing. And it very quickly became something that I realized I wanted to do as a career. And so, I have now transitioned from being a doctor into a travel blogger.

[00:01:18.170] - Leanne
And then from there I started teaching blogging as well. So, I still do a lot of traveling. I'm the owner of a very badly behaved campervan called Nell. But most of the time, I can be found teaching ethical passive income strategies to bloggers, including affiliate marketing, email marketing, and selling digital products. And if you want to join my community, you can find us over at Facebook.com/groups/passiveincomebloggers.

[00:01:43.960] - Leanne
And I'd also encourage you to download my affiliate templates, which you'll find a link to below in order to be able to start getting some results with your own website. So, today, we're going to be talking about strategies for small and low authority sites to rank for lucrative keywords. We are going to be talking about the type of affiliate programs which have the power to grow your income much, much faster than say, the likes of Amazon Associates. We're going to be talking about your secret superpower that only small bloggers have.

[00:02:17.800] - Leanne
We are going to talk about how to target lucrative keywords bigger bloggers are overlooking, and how to outrank those bigger bloggers to rank number one for your keyword.

[00:02:27.190] - Leanne
And we're also going to be talking about how you can get your audience to return to your content when they are ready to buy. So, a quick reminder for anybody who's new to affiliate marketing. Affiliate marketing is basically a way of earning commissions when somebody buys a product through your unique affiliate link. So, if you recommend a product, somebody clicks on it, and then if they buy within a defined period of time, which is known as the cookie period, then you're going to get a percentage of that sale. And you can use your affiliate links in blog posts, pages on your site,

[00:02:59.860] - Leanne
email, social media, Pinterest, lots of different ways to use them. But you do need to check the rules of each program to understand what you're allowed to do and where you're allowed to promote it.

[00:03:11.230] - Leanne
So Firstly, I want to completely get rid of this myth. Okay. So, I hear all the time that people say that you need lots of traffic to earn a decent income blogging. And whilst it makes it easier, it's definitely not an essential. So, I started earning consistent income when I had around 5000 page fees. And to be honest, I probably could have started earning a little bit sooner than that, but it was around 5000 page views when I start to get really serious about SEO and affiliate marketing.

[00:03:38.960] - Leanne
And then by the time I reached 40,000 page views, I was having consistent $5,000 a month and that income was 100% from affiliate marketing and passive income strategies.

[00:03:51.040] - Leanne
There was no paid sponsorships or anything like that. It was all completely passive income. And if I can do it, then you can absolutely do it too. I didn't come from a background of social media marketing or writing or anything along those lines. I went to University and I trained to become a doctor, so a completely different career, and I managed to make a success of this. And you can see over on the right there that they're one of the commissions from just one of my affiliate programs.

[00:04:21.470] - Leanne
I am just shy of £25,000 and made that particular company over £400,000.

[00:04:33.830] - Leanne
So, successful affiliate marketing involves solving problems with products or services. I want you to remember that this is so so important. And this is where most bloggers go wrong that they're not really thinking about their affiliate links and what the goal is. The goal is always to solve a problem or to help somebody to achieve a goal with a product or a service. So, in order to do this, you need to understand your ideal reader. So, spend some time thinking about who it is that you're reaching with your blog, try to understand what problems they might have, goals they have, frustrations.

[00:05:10.380] - Leanne
And if you're not sure you can ask them, ask them on social media what's your biggest problem? What would you love a solution to? And then once you've got a good idea of this, you can then start looking at products that you promote and thinking about products, experiences or services that can address these issues, particularly if they're going to help somebody to either get rid of a problem or achieve a goal either faster, better or cheaper.

[00:05:39.810] - Leanne
So, let's talk about finding the right product to promote. So, I would recommend if you're a smaller blogger, you're going to see results much faster if you focus on promoting slightly higher priced products. And the reason for this is because it is so much easier to sell a handful of expensive products than hundreds of low cost products. So, if you are selling, say a $1,000 product with a 10% Commission, that's $100 per sale. If you sell ten of those, then you've made your 1st $1,000.

[00:06:15.520] - Leanne
However, if you're selling a $10 product with the same 10% Commission, you're going to need to sell 100 of those to have the same income. And that's going to be much much harder. So, there are high ticket affiliate products in virtually every niche, but some niches you do have to look at a little bit harder to find them.

[00:06:36.090] - Leanne
So, we're going to be focusing on three types of programs. So, the first one is your high ticket products. These are the more expensive products and luxury one off big spends. So, have a little think about what's the most expensive thing that you've spent money on.

[00:06:49.770] - Leanne
The next one are high Commission products. These might not necessarily have the same high price tag, but you're getting a higher percentage Commission. So, there are some physical products that have high commissions, but because there is a bigger profit margin with digital products, like online courses, you can often get commissions of anywhere between, say, 30 and 70% for online courses. And there are online courses in virtually every single niche. So, again, that can be really really lucrative.

[00:07:19.570] - Leanne
And the third one I want you to think about is recurring income. So, this means that you are earning income every single month and that's going to add up. So, think about things where somebody has to subscribe. You don't always get recurring commissions with subscriptions, but often you do. So, have a little think about subscriptions within your niche.

[00:07:43.390] - Leanne
So, the first question I want you to ask yourself is what is the biggest splurge that you have made on a product and experience or a service that you would be willing to spend on again? Is there something that you would rave about to your friends? You've got no problem, no hesitation in recommending it because even though it's expensive, it's completely worth that price. And it's something that's been super valuable to you. So, have a little think about your niche and have a think about what that might be. If we've got, take a look at three popular niche here.

[00:08:16.900] - Leanne
You can see that there are high ticket products in every single one of these niches. So, for example, in travel, it could be an experience like a cruise or Safari or an expedition. It could be the camera that you use. It could be an online language course you took. It could be a luxury luggage set or quality backpack. Or it could be something like a tent

[00:08:35.470] - Leanne
if you go camping. It could be hiring a campervan or an RV. If you're in the family niche, it could be something like nursery furniture or a quality Prem or car seat. It could be a summer camp. You sent your kids on a resort that you took your family away on. It could be a home schooling course.

[00:08:52.420] - Leanne
It could be a service like, for example, hiring a nanny. It could be outdoor play equipment in the garden. And if you're in the health and fitness niche, it could be home fitness equipment, a gym membership. It could be boot camp or fitness retreat, you went on a weight loss program that you signed up to. It could be nutritional supplements that you get every month or a fitness watch that you purchased, or it could be something like a race or an endurance event that you signed up to.

[00:09:20.810] - Leanne
So, the next one is the high Commission products. So, remember, these are mostly digital products, but not always. And the way that you can find the physical products that have high commissions is by having a look on affiliate networks and filtering via EPCs. You're looking for the programs that have the highest earnings per click.

[00:09:40.460] - Leanne
So that's often a good way to find products that have high commission rates in terms of finding digital products. And remember, there are online courses in virtually every single niche. The best way to find those is by searching your niche or a topic within your niche and then the name of a popular course platform. And so, they are course platforms like Podia, Teachable, Kajabi, or Think It. So say, for example, you were in the fitness niche.

[00:10:10.790] - Leanne
You might type in fitness podio or fitness teachable and see what comes up. You might also search for specific topics like yoga Podia, yoga teachable, and that way you're going to find a lot of online courses. And if you're in the same niche, you might be able to reach out to that blogger and propose a collaboration. Because often bloggers will be willing to give away their courses for free. If they can see that you're going to be a really really good affiliate for them.

[00:10:35.840] - Leanne
But you need to pitch that just like you would pitch any sponsorship to a brand. You can also look for things like ebooks on marketplaces. There are a couple of online marketplaces for ebooks such as Ejunkies, which is marketejunkie.com. And there is also Discovergumroad.com.

[00:10:53.690] - Leanne
So, they're good places to find ebooks. If you think about things like online courses, memberships, ebooks, software, apps, planners, printables, they're all going to have those high commission rates. It's also worth asking in Facebook groups, particularly groups of other bloggers.

[00:11:11.600] - Leanne
A lot of them might have their own products and be looking for affiliates, so ask in those groups. And if you know of any bloggers that have their own online courses or ebooks that you think would be a good fit for your audience, then you can reach out to them directly.

[00:11:28.170] - Leanne
And then finally, we've got those recurring commission programs. Now what I will say about this is that there are definitely more of these in the B2B niches, the  finance, gaming, online security niche. But there are still programs in all niches. If you look hard enough. So, think about things like subscription boxes, monthly magazines, online software, membership, things like that. And you see there are some examples here.

[00:11:51.310] - Leanne
So, for example, in the travel niche, we've got the Dollar Flight Club, where they find flight deals every month and email them to you. You can get a 50% recurring commission on that. There's Fan Jewel, which is fantasy sports Gaming, which is the 35% recurring commission. We've got format, which is for photographers. It's an online portfolio system with 20% to 30% recurring Commission.

[00:12:16.510] - Leanne
Safety Wing is another one for travel bloggers. It's travel insurance with 10% recurring Commission. We've got Food Blogger Pro, which is a membership teaching food bloggers how to grow their food blogs. And you can get 20% to 40% recurring commissions with that. And we've also got the Benefit Box, which is a nutritional supplement subscription where you get between 3 and $9 per box sold.

[00:12:40.350] - Leanne
So imagine if you are selling ten even at the lower end of that. So, say you are selling ten $3 products, that's $30 every month, but every month that's going to increase. So, after ten months of selling you know an extra ten every month, you've now got an income of $300 that you are getting every single month and that's only going to grow.

[00:13:05.050] - Leanne
So, you might be thinking, okay, that's great. I've got an idea. Now I want to get these high ticket products, but perhaps you haven't actually got an experience with high ticket products. And that sounds pretty expensive to go out and buy one of those products only to promote it. So, in an ideal world, you will think about things that you've already spent on. But if you don't, if there's nothing that you can think of, then here are a few ways in order to sort of save money on doing this.

[00:13:33.230] - Leanne
So, the first thing would be to ask around and see if any of your friends have the product that perhaps you could borrow for a few days. If it's, say an online thing like some software or program online, then often they'll have free trials. So, you know make the most of those free trials. Also try to purchase the product during sales periods. A really good example of this is there is a company called Ultimate Bundles that sells a bundle of digital products in virtually every niche, and they've got a different sale every few weeks.

[00:14:04.850] - Leanne
And so what you can do is when your niche's bundle is available, you can sign up to that. You can actually promote the bundle and earn money that way. But you can then sign up to all the individual products that are relevant for your audience. And like I said, they do have bundles in virtually every niche, family niches, photography, travel, food and cooking so many different niches. So that's a really good way to do it.

[00:14:31.030] - Leanne
You could hire a writer like a ghostwriter that does have experience with the product. You could arrange a collaboration with other bloggers. So, for example, if you're doing a round up of products, you could ask bloggers to talk about the product that they have experience with. So, you're gaining collectively from their experience. You could pitch the brand just like you would for sponsorship, so you could pitch a sponsorship or a trial or a giveaway.

[00:14:57.640] - Leanne
But you just need to make sure that if you're doing that, you're very clear that you do intend to promote the product as an affiliate and make sure that they allow for that. You could buy the product second hand and then sell it on secondhand if you no longer need it. So, often, products don't really lose that much value if they're already secondhand. And the other option is that you could keep back a proportion of your affiliate revenue in order to reinvest that in other products.

[00:15:28.370] - Leanne
In order to be successful with affiliate marketing, particularly when you have a smaller blog and a smaller audience, you need to really understand the sales funnel. So, the idea is that a person moves from being unaware of a problem or unaware of a goal, and then gradually you become more aware of that problem or goal. Then they become aware of the solutions, and then they become aware of specific products. So, you're going to be reaching people at different stages of this cycle with different types of article.

[00:15:56.700] - Leanne
So, when somebody is currently not aware of a problem or a goal, you might make them aware of that with an inspirational article.

[00:16:03.910] - Leanne
And then when they become aware of that issue, they're not quite sure how to solve it. So, they might go and search something like a how to guide, and then that's going to help them become aware of various solutions, but not necessarily specific products. So, at that point, you might want to reach them with something like a product roundup or a buying guide or something along those lines. And then finally, when they're product aware, they're now deciding which is the right product that's going to be a good fit for them.

[00:16:29.670] - Leanne
So, things like reviews, comparisons, interviews with product owners, case studies, things like that are going to be what makes them make that decision, which product to go for.

[00:16:40.250] - Leanne
So, when somebody is at the top of the funnel, they are less likely to make a purchase. So, these sort of inspirational articles are not going to convert very many affiliate links. So, if you've got lots of these articles that are getting lots of traffic on your blog, you might be able to earn some ad revenue with them. But you're not going to earn very much with affiliate marketing. So, therefore, it's really important that you make sure on your blog you have more of these articles that are reaching people at the bottom of the funnel.

[00:17:08.130] - Leanne
So, particularly reviews, comparisons, interviews and case studies, and then also product roundups and buying guides. And you'll want to have some how to guides there as well. Ideally, you will have articles that reach people at every stage of that funnel on your website, and you don't have to make every single article that you write, a review or a comparison that's going to get boring pretty quickly. But just make a commitment. Perhaps once every one in every three blog posts or something like that is something that is going to be focused on your affiliate links.

[00:17:37.770] - Leanne
And that's the way that you're going to start earning decent money even with a small blog.

[00:17:44.250] - Leanne
So, you do not need a lot of traffic. But you do need the right traffic. So if you were to get 100 people who were already ready to buy that product to read your article. It's going to be so much more effective than, say, getting 1000 people to read an article when they're just not ready to buy. They haven't even realized they've got an issue. They haven't realized they've got a problem.

[00:18:09.050] - Leanne
They don't have a goal in mind. It's too early in that funnel for them to buy. So, even though there's more people reading it, you're going to earn less money. And often bloggers get bogged down by search volume. But it's far less important than purchase intent.

[00:18:25.500] - Leanne
So, many bloggers will shoot for those high volume keywords, but they're not going to think about monetization until later, and that's never going to be as effective. And many of these big bloggers are going to skip past those keywords below a certain search volume. But that actually represents an opportunity for smaller savvy bloggers like you to go and moz up those smaller keywords, but the ones that have high purchase intent.

[00:18:55.570] - Leanne
So, let me show you an example. Say, you were a travel blogger and you wrote an article called Best Cities in Europe on a Budget. Now this particular phrase shows very low like purchase intent. Somebody is very unlikely to purchase a product through this article because they're just in the idea stage. However, if they start to search something like Best Places to Stay in Lisbon on a budget, they've now moved into the planning stage, and now you've got a better chance of getting an affiliate sale.

[00:19:31.750] - Leanne
However, you could take it to the next level, and a super high purchase intent would be somebody that's looking at a review. So, a particular hotel review that's going to have a very high chance of making an affiliate sale. So, you can create these sort of purchase intent keyword formulas where you would keep this in mind every time you join a new affiliate program and create clusters of content targeting different keywords. So, we want to be looking at reviews, comparisons, best products within a certain niche, or for a certain person.

[00:20:08.910] - Leanne
The how to guide where the product is part of that solution.

[00:20:12.510] - Leanne
Tutorials, demos, case studies, how to use a product, best Places to Stay in a certain place, is a certain product worth it, that's a little bit like a review post. These are all the sorts of keywords that you need to be targeting if you want to earn a good income with your blog.

[00:20:33.250] - Leanne
So, once you've written one of these articles, you shouldn't stop there. You need to write more articles around the same topic. Now they need to be slightly different. You don't want to write the same article in several different ways because you're just basically competing with yourself. But you need to look at it from different angles. So, for example, if you've written a review article, then perhaps you could write a comparison, or perhaps you could do a top ten listicle, or perhaps more of a solution focused article or tutorial.

[00:20:59.540] - Leanne
I'll just mention the product and other blog posts and linking back to those review posts and interlinking all of your blog posts together. And the more related content that you have around a topic, the more that Google is going to start to see you as the expert. It also helps to keep someone coming back to your site until they are ready to make purchase. If you can add a related lead magnet to these pages to get that person onto your email list or to at least follow you on social media so that you have a way to reconnect with them.

[00:21:33.790] - Leanne
I just want to share with you a little case study. This is a blog post that gets tiny search volumes.

[00:21:41.430] - Leanne
Okay. It only gets 75 page views a month. So, it was a review of a hiking trip in Peru. The keywords I targeted had a tiny search volume of just ten, and I am ranking for several other similar search terms, but they've all got tiny, tiny keyword search volumes. And so, like I said, I only get 75 unique visits per month, which is tiny. Now that particular article has generated $2,361 over 20 months.

[00:22:11.310] - Leanne
So that means that for every 1000 people that visit that page, it's making $1,300. And if you compare that to ads you might be earning, say $20 or if you're lucky, $30 or $40 per thousand page views. So, you can see that's a massive  massive difference. And that's why you can earn a really good income with a small blog if you're managing to target these high purchase intent keywords. So, why was the Rpm so high for that particular blog post?

[00:22:42.320] - Leanne
Well, Firstly, it targeted a keyword with a super high purchase intent. So, it was a review article to remember that's meeting people at the end of the funnel. It was also a high ticket product, so I didn't have to sell too many of them in order to start seeing the decent commissions. And the article was very thorough, so it left no questions unanswered. I always include an FAQ section at the end of all of these articles, which means that people are less likely to feel that they need to go away and do more research.

[00:23:08.980] - Leanne
I've already answered all their questions. I've also used clear call to actions throughout. So, I like using things like buttons, bright colored text, make my affiliate links nice and bold. I tell people what to do. I say click here in order to check the up to date prices. I give them some guidance, and so that has resulted in a 16% click through rate, and the industry average is actually only 1 o 2%.

[00:23:32.910] - Leanne
So, if you can get a 16% click through rate, you're already in a really strong position. And the other thing that I did was I had a variety of routes back to the site. So, let me give you a scenario if somebody has already decided that they want to go on a particular trip, but they just need that little bit of confidence. So, they go and look up some reviews. Now, they've already saved that article to their bookmarks.

[00:23:57.210] - Leanne
They know where to go to it in order to get back to that. They don't need to click through your affiliate link, but your article might be what persuades them. So, you need to have other routes back to that website, other affiliate links that direct them to pages that they might not have seen. So, in this particular case, it was a cancellation policy. However, it could be anything.

[00:24:16.530] - Leanne
It could be a link to a testimonial page. It could be a link to a charity that that company supports. It could be a link to a discount page or something along those lines. So, have a little think about pages that they might not have seen that you can use to lock that affiliate cookie.

[00:24:35.990] - Leanne
So what happens if somebody visits your blog post, but they're not ready to buy? Now, there are three scenarios here. So, one is that they visit your blog post and your blog post is what persuades them to buy and they purchase straight away and you get the commission. The second is that they are not quite ready to buy straight away, but a few days later they decide to go ahead.

[00:24:56.640] - Leanne
And because you're within the cookie period, you get the Commission. The third scenario is that they're not ready after reading your article in order to purchase, and they need more time. But unfortunately, they take longer to make that decision than your cookie period is valid for. And so, in this circumstance, you're going to lose the commission unless you can find a way in order to get them to click on your affiliate link again when they're ready to buy the product. So, one of the best ways to do this is to offer a related lead magnet, something that the person who would buy that affiliate product would also be interested in.

[00:25:32.550] - Leanne
So it could be like a checklist or something along those lines, like a PDF guide, something that helps that particular type of person and that they're going to be interested to download for free. And then they get onto your email list. And then this is going to give you the opportunity to send a sequence of emails. It's going to grow that trust. So, they're going to trust you, but also to help them with that purchase decision.

[00:25:56.570] - Leanne
And if you don't have an email list yet, then firstly, I would encourage you to start email lists are super lucrative, really useful to have. And these days, with social media algorithms changing all the time, email marketing is becoming more and more important. But if you don't have an email list, then at the very least, try to get somebody to follow you on social media. Because again, you've got an opportunity to get your affiliate links in front of them again. So, make sure that you've got things like little pop ups that say follow me on social media, or perhaps an incentive to join your Facebook group or to go over to Instagram.

[00:26:30.300] - Leanne
Tell them about you know the content that you create over there.

[00:26:36.630] - Leanne
So, if you go down the route of creating an affiliate email funnel, then what you want to do is firstly, offer a closely related freebie. And this is really important because you want to get the ideal people on your email list. There's no point growing your email list of people who are not interested in the products that you're going to be promoting. They're not interested in the topics that you write about. So, you need to make sure that whatever it is that you're promoting as a freebie is highly relevant.

[00:27:01.470] - Leanne
And then you would send a welcome email.

[00:27:03.490] - Leanne
You deliver that freebie in your welcome email and you introduce them to your brand and give them a little bit of background about yourself. Then you might send a couple of emails to warm them up on related topics with quick win tips. Okay, so this is going to keep them opening your emails. It's going to help them trust you. And then you're going to start looping back to that affiliate product in like, a little mini sale series.

[00:27:22.990] - Leanne
Treat it like it's your own product, so you could focus on the results that you got. You could give, like a mini case study. You could answer some frequently asked questions. So, just think about the different ways that you could promote that and keep looping back to that affiliate product. And then once they've gone through that little series of affiliate promo emails, you can then tag them as ready for your newsletter.

[00:27:45.050] - Leanne
And now you have grown your email list with people that are your ideal reader. So, finally, I wanted to talk about your small blog superpower. So when you have a smaller following or an email list, you've got the opportunity to be super helpful because you're not going to have as many people commenting on your posts or replying to your emails. So, you can give more attention to the ones that do. So, you can answer their questions personally provide a lot of value.

[00:28:13.380] - Leanne
I personally like to use a tool called Vocalbird, which is a Chrome extension which allows me to record voice messages. You can also use things like loom to do videos, and this means that you can send that video or that voicemail message to somebody. And it's a really personal way to get in touch with somebody. It's also a good time saver because it's much faster to record a voice message than it is to type a message. But it allows you to really give that personal experience. And this is going to help you to basically build that loyalty with your followers.

And there is this theory of reciprocity. I can never say that word reciprocity where basically, if you are providing a lot of value for somebody, they want to do a favor back for you. So, if they're going to purchase the product, they might actually come and seek your affiliate links. They might ask you what your affiliate link is, and they're far more likely to follow your recommendations and suggestions if they trust you because they've had this experience with you. So, get to know your loyal followers.

Respond to them. Remember the small details about them. You know if there's something that comes up a topic that comes up in a Facebook group or something, you could tag them because you know that they'd be interested in it. You can you know remind them of small details from your conversations. And you can also send direct messages to those who are actively engaging with your content. Now, what I don't mean is that really annoying, like cold pitching in some of these DMs super annoying when you don't know somebody, and the next thing you know, they're recommending their product to you in the DMs.

Don't do that, but you can use Instagram stories to give your audience an opportunity to engage, and you can use that as an opportunity to discover that the problems that they might be facing or the goals that they have. And then you can think about ways that you could solve those problems or help them achieve their goals with products. So, for example, you could ask them which they struggle with most A or B, and then if they click on A or B, you can then follow up with them because they've already shown that they're engaged.

They've already told you that they've got a problem and you can follow up with a helpful message, make sure that you do provide value in your message, like give them a tip or something like that. And then you can follow up and say you might also be interested in this particular product that I recommend, and you can then share your affiliate link, and you are reaching people who are quite likely to convert. Because they've already told you that they have that problem and need a solution.
