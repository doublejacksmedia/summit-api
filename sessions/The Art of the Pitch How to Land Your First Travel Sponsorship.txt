Hello, everyone. I'm so excited that you're here. My name is Daniella. I'm the founder of Wildly Successful Travelpreneurs and a blogger over at Our Soulful Travels. And today I'm going to be chatting with you about the art of the pitch and specifically how to land your very first travel sponsorship as a blogger. Now it's all very exciting, but before we get into it, allow me to quickly introduce myself. Hi, I'm Daniella Schoeman. That's me and my adorable little boy Kai in the photo while we were on a sponsored stay in a luxury tree house when he was only three months old. That was actually his third time on a sponsored stay with me, and he's almost two now. And together as a family, we've been on tons of sponsored stays all over the world. So I've been in the travel industry for the past seven years when I shifted the niche of my wellness blog to wellness travel about mid-2016. I landed my first sponsorships in 2017, and those were a one night comp stay at a hotel in Brussels, a media rate stay at a hotel in Amsterdam, and City Passes for two people in Brussels, Ghent, and Amsterdam.

[00:01:17.620] - Daniella
Amazingly, I accomplished all that with a tiny blog and a brand new Instagram account. I have no other platform, no other audience. So if you're a new blogger, there's definitely hope for you. And to me, that was proof of concept, that this life was possible. But those sponsorships took literally hundreds of pictures and a ton of time, so it just wasn't sustainable. After that trip, I joined Arrivedo.com, a South America-based company, where I created neighborhood guides for hotels that were published on their platform. Within a year of starting with them, I had worked with about 45 hotels around the world, and was one of their top travel writers. Some of those hotels paid me, some sponsored me, and some sponsored and paid me to create the travel content for them. And this is really where I honed my pitching and negotiation skills, and actually when I started teaching pitching as well. Since then, I've gone on to work as the Travel and Wellness Editor and Senior Writer for Rare Magazine, which is now TrooRa. My travel content and hotel reviews have been published in Culture Trip, Beau Monde Traveler, DRIFT Travel Magazine and Luxury Lifestyle Magazine. I've also ghostwritten dozens of articles for global brands like Japan Airlines, and even worked on the PR side of things writing press releases for travel brands, like the Banyan Tree Group.

[00:02:38.210] - Daniella
So this experience in all the different parts of the industry has given me unique insights into working with brands, magazines, PRs, and even the content marketing agencies within the travel niche. Plus, it's given me plenty of opportunities to refine my pitches and land those high value travel sponsorships and paid partnerships that most of us are looking for. Now I'm on a mission to teach aspiring travelpreneurs and travel bloggers like you how to get published, how to earn an income from the travel content you're already creating, and most of all, how to land travel sponsorships by learning how to pitch.

[00:03:16.650] - Daniella
Now that you know why I have the experience to talk to you about this topic, I want to make sure that you get the absolute most out of this session. So please take a moment to put your phones on do not disturb mode. I'll close out all the other tabs and get ready to take some notes. Let's go ahead and dive into what you're going to learn today. Since this training is aimed at beginners, I wanted to make it as accessible as possible. It will focus on how to pitch brands for sponsorship, not payments specifically. However, I genuinely believe that all travel content creators deserve to be paid. It takes a lot of time and effort and skills to create travel content, so you need to learn how to charge your worth. But it takes time. I also know that the first sponsorship can be really hard to land and especially nerve-wrecking to pitch, especially if you're a new blogger. So I hope that you use what you learned here today as a stepping stone to land your first sponsorship. And then once you've done that, use that win as a springboard towards paid partnerships. We all need to start somewhere, and this presentation is designed to give you the right foundations.

[00:04:24.800] - Daniella
The first thing you'll learn today is why your follower count, engagement rates, and blog stats really don't matter to brands. It's true. This is a huge block for most bloggers who think that their stats are insignificant and that they have nothing worthwhile to offer to brands. If this is your mindset, then you're not even going to try. It's important that we start by dispelling this myth that followers or sessions are the only way to work with brands. Then I'm going to share what actually matters to brands, as well as the various different ways that you can work with travel brands, as well as my number one tip for landing your first travel sponsorship as a new blogger.

[00:05:03.830] - Daniella
Next, we're going to tackle the four common pitching mistakes that most bloggers make. So pitching is an art, and even the most talented creators can stumble when it comes to reaching out to brands and hotels. Through my experience coaching, aspiring travel content creators, I've observed some recurring mistakes that can really get in the way of you landing your sponsorships. So I'm going to shed some light on these common mistakes, but more importantly, I'm going to equip you with the knowledge and techniques to avoid them or fix them in the future. By addressing these mistakes, you're going to be better equipped to craft, persuasive and successful pitches that really capture the attention of sponsors and open doors to exciting opportunities for you. I'm also going to reveal to you the one and only goal of your initial pitch so that you know exactly what to focus on once we get into that next section.

[00:05:54.960] - Daniella
Finally, we'll delve into the seven crucial components of a successful pitch. Mastering these can really boost your success rate and neglecting them could lead to ignored emails. Luckily, once you know what goes into a successful pitch, you can repeat the process over and over again with confidence. And once you know the winning pitch formula, I'll give you two options for how you can approach pitching and provide you with a handy resource to make the best option a lot easier. Okay, so now that you know where we're going, let's go ahead and get started. I hope you're ready because I'm super excited to share my pitching secrets with you.

[00:06:36.360] - Daniella
You've probably been told that you need thousands of followers or blog sessions to work with brands or get sponsored to stay at a hotel. I'm here to tell you that this is not true. It's what I like to call the follower count myth. So there are plenty of ways to work with brands, and not all of them rely solely on your follower count or traffic. Now, this is a common misconception, and it's left over from the days when influencer marketing was really new and there was really only one way to work with brands. For example, you would post something on your Instagram or publish a blog post and hope and pray that it gets enough engagement for the brand's approval. But you need to understand that the industry has been shifting over the past few years. There's more of a focus on user-generated content, UGC. Let's get real. If you're pitching to create content that brands will share on their own platforms, be it their website, social media, email campaigns, or blogs, they are not losing sleep over your follower count or even you personally. What truly matters to brands is the quality of the content that you produce for them. So in that case, I want you to view your blog or social media platforms as a portfolio that showcases to brands the quality of work they can expect from you. The engagement doesn't matter to them. So you need to shift your focus from the numbers game to the content creation game if you want to work with brands. And that's the mindset you're going to need going into the rest of this training. When it comes to collaborating with hotels and other travel brands, there are three different approaches you can take, and I'm going to go into each of them with you. One, you can provide a service. Two, you can offer exposure. Or three, you can do both. If you don't have a follower account or traffic to offer the brand much exposure, then you're going to opt for providing a service.

[00:08:29.900] - Daniella
And this is a seriously cool way of supporting the tourism industry practically with a skill or service that you already have experience in or isn't too far out of your comfort zone. Best of all, you don't have to be a social media guru to do this at all. You just need to be great in the industry you're currently working in or have experience in and know how to pitch, which is something I'm going to teach you here. However, you can even supercharge your collaborations by combining high value services with exposure, and this will result in more sponsorships and a higher likelihood of paid partnerships for you. There are thousands of services that you can provide. You can provide hotels and exchange for a come stay or brand in exchange for a product like a set of luggage. The great thing about providing a service is that they're usually really high value and you can easily adjust the scope to take a collaboration from a sponsorship to a paid partnership once you're more comfortable working with brands. Some of the services my students and I have offered travel brands in the past are website development or management, photography or videography, social media management, graphic design, copywriting, that could be web copy, email copy or blog posts, SEO services, or writing reviews for magazines.

[00:09:50.000] - Daniella
So this is my personal favorite and how I work with most brands. And it has the added benefit of combining offering a service, writing the reviews for them and providing them with exposure through the brand, social media, the brand's traffic… Sorry, through the magazine's social media, through the magazine's traffic that they get. So it's really a win-win-win situation collaboration. However, I'm always trying to broaden my expertise and think outside of the box when it comes to collaboration so that I can offer as much value to the tourism industry as possible. The opportunities are endless. Simply combine your own skills and expertise with what the brand needs and you've got a winning formula. Now, if you're still feeling unsure about pitching brands or for your first travel sponsorship, I'm going to suggest that you start local. That is my number one tip for new bloggers. Local could be your hometown, your home state or province, or even your home country, as long as you're very familiar with the destination. Think about it. Creating content for a local hotel or your local tourism board is much easier than if you were to go international. You're already an expert in the destination. You have knowledge that other creators might not have about that area, and this makes it so much easier to convince a brand to work with you specifically. For example, I recently took a group of 20 creators through a pitching challenge aimed specifically at pitching their local tourism brands. Many of them were new bloggers without an established following, and amazingly, 95% of them were able to land at least one sponsorship during the challenge, and most of them landed multiple partnerships. So if you want a low risk and high reward pitching challenge, I suggest starting with your local tourism brands.

[00:11:44.430] - Daniella
But before we get into the next section, I have a question for you. What is the main or only goal of your initial email pitch to a travel brand? In other words, what do you think it needs to accomplish? Please drop your answers in the chat box below. I'm going to answer you soon.

[00:12:03.230] - Daniella
Now let's talk about the four common mistakes in pitching that many travel bloggers make. Mistake number one: your pitch is too long. Think about it. How do you feel if you receive a lengthy email, it feels like reading a novel. It's overwhelming, right? You lose concentration, your attention begins to waver. Keep that in mind when writing your pitch too. The shorter, the sweeter. When it comes to pitching, treat your pitch like a captivating blurb, not a 10-page essay. Within just a few sentences, you should be able to grab their attention and leave them wanting to know more.

[00:12:41.180] - Daniella
Mistake number two: you start negotiating right away. While enthusiasm is essential, revealing all your cards in your initial pitch may not be the best approach. It usually isn't. Discussing fees, assets, and deliverables too soon can come across as desperate. Your goal is to pique their interest and creates a desire to learn more about working with you. Leave negotiation discussions for a later stage, please.

[00:13:08.740] - Daniella
Mistake number three: it's all about you. I know you're awesome and you should definitely be proud of your achievements but a pitch focused solely on self-praise will definitely not resonate with brands. You need to strike a balance by providing a brief introduction about yourself, but keep the spotlight on conveying the value that you can offer them. So you need to align your pitch with their needs and their objectives.

[00:13:35.350] - Daniella
Mistake number four: you attach a media kit. I know that other coaches tend to advise that you attach your media kit, but I don't suggest that you do that, and here's why. While media kits are valuable assets, attaching one to your pitch can stop the conversation in its tracks. Think about it. If you give the brand all the information, there's no intrigue, and in my experience, it prevents brands from replying more often than not. What you should do instead is wait for the brand to express interest and request your media kit. This approach increases the likelihood of a reply and opens up a genuine dialog about potential collaborations. So by avoiding these common pitfalls and tailoring your pitches to each brand, you increase your chances of landing those coveted sponsorships. When it comes to pitching, you really need to approach it from the right mindset. Remember that if you're doing this correctly, you're not asking for something free. Get that out of your head. You are offering a value exchange. Collaboration is beneficial for both parties. When writing a pitch, you don't ask for something, especially not in the first one. That's how you make sure that your emails get ignored or deleted, and that's not what we want.

[00:14:53.810] - Daniella
Instead, you're offering something. It's easy to ignore a creator that is asking for something right off the bat. It's much harder to ignore a creator who is offering something. That's why it's really important that you include the right information in your initial pitch, and that's what we're going to get to soon. Finally, I want you to understand that the one and only goal of your initial pitch is to get a response. We're not negotiating, we're not signing a deal, we're not getting the contracts ready. You want the brand to open up your email, read it, and then respond to you. The response itself is irrelevant. You will get nos more often than not, at least at first. You have to get used to it. You'll get requests for more information, which begins the negotiation phase, which is what we want most of all. And sometimes you'll get a yes straight away, and that's amazing. Regardless of the response, if you get a reply to your email, then you know that your pitch is working as intended. How do you ensure that you get a response to your pitches? You make sure that it has all the right elements, and that is what we're going to discuss next.

[00:16:08.750] - Daniella
But first, tell me, do you know what the average response rate of a cold email or pitch is? So a pitch is basically just a cold email and it has an average response rate, which is pretty low. But if you know, please drop your answers in the chat box, and I'm going to reveal the surprising percentage very soon. So most people make pitching a lot more complicated than it needs to be. It's really not that complex. A pitch is basically just a cold email and there are proven methods for success with cold emails. Unfortunately, the average response rate for a cold email is 8.5%. That's pretty low. It means that a pitch won't work every single time and you just have to get used to it. 91.5% of the time your pitch won't be successful, but it's that 8.5% that really counts. Just because the average response rate is low doesn't mean that you can't increase your odds. You can, you totally can. You do it by optimizing your pitch in such a way that it prompts a response. The following elements are essential for pitch, and you need to make sure that you include all of them whenever you're pitching.

[00:17:28.900] - Daniella
The first element is the subject line. You need to come up with a captivating subject line, when that grabs the recipient's attention right away within all the emails and the inbox. You need to keep it concise, intriguing and relevant to your pitch. So for example, you could make your subject line "Collaboration opportunity: Let's showcase your brand to a global audience." I like to A/B test my subject lines on a regular basis. So what I'll do is I'll craft two different subject lines for each pitch campaign (you can use ChatGPT to do this), and then I'll send half the pitches with one subject line and the other half of the pitches with another subject line. I then compare them to see which of them gets more responses and opens as well. This type of experimentation allows me to see what works and what doesn't work for my particular niche and each different campaign. You can then refine it over time until you have a subject line you know that works for you every single time.

[00:18:33.770] - Daniella
The next element is the greeting. Begin with a personalized greeting to establish a connection with the recipient. Whenever possible, use a relevant contact's name. This means that you need to do some research or digging on LinkedIn to find out who is in charge of partnerships for the brand. This could be a Marketing Manager, a general manager, a press director, owner, or even a PR agent at a third-party agency. It is up to you to find out who the decision maker is and address them directly in your pitch.

[00:19:05.930] - Daniella
The third element is the introduction. Introduce yourself briefly and mention your role as a travel content creator. Keep it concise and highlight any relevant achievements or experiences that make you uniquely qualified to work with that brand. This is where people make the most mistakes when it comes to pitching. Most people add way too much information about themselves, and this can make the pitch too long. People stop reading it. Whenever you're in doubt, remember that your pitch is about the brand, not about you. Keep it short. Give them your name, your blog name, your business name. Mention what type of travel content you create, so your niche. If you have a really unique stat, such as follower engagement, views count, or whatever, or write for an esteemed publication, then you might mention it here too, otherwise, leave it out.

[00:19:59.110] - Daniella
The fourth element is an explanation for why you're contacting them. Include a sentence that will be used to explain why you're reaching out to that brand specifically. This will help you to personalize your pitch a lot more. For example, if I was reaching out to one of my local tourism brand, I would say something like, I'm reaching out because I'm a South African based in Mossel Bay and I'm deeply familiar with the Garden Route, which means that I can provide you with specialized content that only a local could create. You could add a sentence that will showcase your enthusiasm for their brand, products or services. You could also include a sentence that briefly mentions how you discovered them or what caught your attention about their brand in the first place. The fifth element is outlining the benefits of a partnership. Now this is where we get into the juicy bits, a.k.a. the stuff that the brand really, really cares about. Draft a sentence or two that will highlight the potential benefits of partnering with you, for instance, your local knowledge. Use this section to emphasize the value that you can provide, such as increased exposure, engaging content, access to your audience, or the specialized services that you can provide.

[00:21:19.440] - Daniella
Focus on how collaboration could mutually benefit both of you, so you and the brand. Remember that the benefits you'd highlight would vary from brand to brand, so this is a very personalized or customized part of the pitch. The sixth element is a call to action or CTA. This is really important and a huge reason why most people don't get replies to their pitches. You need to include a clear and concise call to action when that direct the recipients onto the next steps. You shouldn't leave them confused about what to do next. Your CTA could ask them to respond to get more information, such as your media kits or red card to keep the conversation going. Or it can ask them to schedule a quick call with you. You can add a calendar link to make it really easy for them. Or anything else that encourages them to reply or respond in some way. As we talked about earlier, remember that goal of your initial pitch is not to secure the sponsorship or partnership. The goal is to open up lines of communication with the brand. So use your CTA as a way to keep the conversation going.

[00:22:29.180] - Daniella
The final element of a successful pitch is the closing. You want to wrap up the email with a polite and professional closing. Thank the recipient for their time and consideration. I like to throw it in there, "I look forward to your reply" as well, because this acts as another prompt to get them to respond. Include your contact information and website or social media handles for easy reference, and make sure that your email signature looks professional. Now that you know the elements needed to write a successful pitch, it's time to learn how to use that information.

[00:23:05.850] - Daniella
Okay, now before I end this presentation, I want to go over a few action steps with you based on what we've discussed. So your first step would be to figure out what services you could offer brands. Take some time to list out some of the services or experience or skills that you have. This could be services you provide to clients already or other skills or expertise that you have. Next, you need to find the travel brands you want to pitch. If you're taking my advice and then starting local, then you probably have a few hotels or attractions or tourism boards in mind already. Create a list of at least five, but preferably 10 brands to pitch. Remember, it's a numbers game. Then you need to do some research. First, you'll need to find the right person to contact at each brand and the email address. So name and email address for direct contact is important. You need a direct email address, not a general one for the best results. So take some time to do a Google search, check out their websites, reach out on social media, check for press releases. Linkedin is always a great option as well. Once you have the contact details evaluate the brand to determine which of your services they most likely need. For example, check their website. If they don't have any photos on their website or social media and they have the poor quality, then they could use your photography skills if you have them. Once again, you're going to be stalking them a little bit, checking out the website, social media, anything that you can find online about them, and then use that to evaluate a fit between your skills and their needs. Once you know what to offer each of the brands you want to pitch, it's time to craft a pitch template. You can do that either using the formula that I just shared with you or use the freebie that I'm giving away to all Summit attendees. Finally, make sure to personalize the template for each and every brand you pitch. You are not going to send the same pitch to every single brand that needs to be customized for the best results. Then double-check that all the information is correct, all the placeholder text has been filled, and check your spelling and grammar, as well. And then once you're ready, hit send. Happy pitching, friends.

[00:25:22.100] - Daniella
Now, do you have any questions? Please drop them in the chat box below. I'm happy to answer or clarify anything that I went over during this presentation. I'll answer them in the chat or maybe in the Summit Facebook group as well. So when it comes to writing pitches, there are two options available to you. You could start from scratch every single time. So starting from scratch, each time you want to pitch a new brand may help you to avoid those pitch template blunders, for example, "dear, first name in brackets," but it's time-consuming, and it's going to limit the number of pitches you send. I want you to remember something. Pitching is a numbers game, especially in the beginning, you want to send as many as possible. And to do that, you need to make pitching a habit and create a weekly or monthly pitching schedule. If you have to start from scratch with each email pitch, you might not be able to keep up with that schedule or you'll just send a lot less than you actually could. Your other option is to use a template.

[00:26:22.650] - Daniella
Using a template is a great way to speed up the process. It helps you to overcome writer's block and gives you a starting point. That way you don't procrastinate or stare at a blank page waiting for inspiration trying to figure out what to say. And if you're a new blogger who hasn't pitched before, this is something that's going to stand in your way. So you can save time that can rather be spent on doing brand research for personalisation or customisation. But if you've ever downloaded or bought someone else's pitch templates and you know that although they provided you with the script, it tends to lack an explanation on exactly how to use it or customize it. These templates also tend to be generic and they don't always follow a winning pitch formula that includes all the elements you need for a pitch. Plus, you usually need to customize a lot to make it really sound like you or let your own personality shine through. But what if you could craft your very own pitch templates, build the solutions so that you can have the convenience of a template, but still have it sound like you so that you can see more success. So in order to help you with crafting your own pitch template, I created the Craft Your Own Pitch Template workbook. This workbook will guide you through creating your own pitch template based on the seven elements of a successful pitch that I shared with you today. With step-by-step guidance and a fill-in-the-blank workbook, this toolkit will walk you through building a pitch template that really gets results. Once your template is complete, you'll be able to tweak it and update it in just a few minutes for any new pitch opportunity. Just swap in the brand specifics where you have placeholder text and your perfect pitch is ready to send. Stop wasting time trying to fit your unique personal brand into someone else's pitch formula.
