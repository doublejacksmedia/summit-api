[00:00:09.880] - Dan Morris, lettersfromdan.com
Hey, hey, this is Dan coming to you today talking about affiliate marketing. I don't know if you know my wife Rachel, but Rachel and I run a Blogging Concentrated, which is, I guess, for the last seven years, has primarily been we do 8 hour workshops around the United States and in New Zealand and Canada and some other places besides the United States. But we do 8 hour workshops, teaching, blogging. We teach, I guess you would say digital marketing more than blogging now that blogging is really just a piece of the bigger puzzle. Right.

[00:00:48.690] - Dan
You can't just write a blog post and then it's over. You've got to do all the other pieces. So, we primarily do that. And then my wife, Rachel, she runs Finding Joy.net, which is a giant motherhood site. It's fifty thousand pages a day. And I think she's said half a million fans on Facebook. And, you know, we do a bunch of stuff with that community. And then the reason for this video is that we also run a two giant products each year.

[00:01:16.950] - Dan
One is called B.C Stack, which you may have heard of. It's in June, July period, depending on when 4th of July falls. And we do Podcasters Kit in October. And both of them are affiliate products. So, that's what we're going to talk about today, is how how do you use affiliate marketing in your in your blogging universe?

[00:01:38.670] - Dan
So, we're going to divide affiliate marketing into two two parts to start with. The first part is what if you host, what if you decide to use affiliate marketing to build your business? And then the second part is, what if you decide to use to be an affiliate for someone like to use affiliate to help monetize your business? So, we're going to talk about both of those halves. And you should have and you should have the worksheet. So, the worksheet should just go kind of like right along with the video. And in fact, to be a little more efficient, I made myself like a little outline of the things that I'm talking about. But if we go off, we go, of course, I'm going to adjust my line so that I can create the perfect worksheet.

[00:02:27.360] - Dan
Okay, so let's talk about hosting. Let's talk about hosting. So that would be a good place to start. So, hosting an affiliate project, I guess call it is what, not talking about hosting like you have your website hosted. I'm talking about what if you put together a product and then you get affiliates to sell your product for you like you're the host of the product and other people do the marketing? All right. That's that's one concept. So, I'm going to does it seem very clear. So, for BC Stack, which happens in June, July, BC Stack.com we do, I guess you would call it. Some people have traditionally called it a bundle. So what we do is we go out and find 65 products and then we put them into one package that we call B.C Stack, and then we sell that to thousands and thousands of people. And then we primarily use affiliates to do the same. Now, for the affiliates, it's- it's money, it's money, right? They make money and then for us, we also make money. But the idea is it grows the list even further because affiliates have lists that you and I don't. So, we have affiliates and in New Zealand and the Philippines, Canada, Europe and all these different places. And they all have spent years and years developing their own lists.

[00:04:05.430] - Dan
So when they market the product to their list, then we grow our list because everybody comes to our landing page. Right, buys the product, which gets them onto our list. So, then it just grows the list quite, quite large.

[00:04:20.040] - Dan
So, the the steps in hosting your own affiliate product are. First, you have to have the product and then the pitch, we're going to go through all these and then the software and the landing page and the prizes and then the key. The key to everything is the universal spreadsheet in my mind.

[00:04:44.530] - Dan
Okay, so the universe for this is what I would like you to do. Now, if you're going to use affiliate marketing or if you're not physically marketing, I would like for you to do this. And that is I want you to figure out. Who are the people in your niche, niche universe, so, you know, like if you're in the if you're in the running world, obviously there's the top runners in the world.

[00:04:44.530] - Dan
The best runners, the marathoners, the four milers, the triathletes like the best runners. And then down from there are the people who write about write. Right, who probably are past runners like Higdon writes about how to do the three hour marathon or the four hour marathon. And then, you know, there's these top people who write about runners. So, if you are running person. You probably have a bookshelf and it's probably have running books like off road running and how to run downhill, lean forward technique, breathing techniques like all the stuff in the running world. Right? And then there's races and there's there's race directors who run these big races like the Boston Marathon. And then there's people who make movies about running like Prefontaine. So, there's an entire world around. Right.

[00:06:05.450] - Dan
So, what I would like you to do is to make a spreadsheet of all the people it doesn't necessarily have to be categorized by. Here's all the best running books and the authors of those books. Here's the best writing movies and the directors and writers of the movies. Here's the top runners. Like you don't have to- I mean, when I started, I had columns for each particular place that I found the top people in the niche. But I've discovered it doesn't really matter. What you really need is just a list. You need to create the list.

[00:06:34.700] - Dan
Now, there are top people in the running world, right? So I get the Olympics. When the Olympics needs a commentator for the running section, they go to the top people in the world, like the last person who won the Olympics last time or whatever. So, who are those people? And my contention is that until those people know who you are, you're not the top people in the running world. You're not top in your niche. So, you need to figure out who what does it look like? Who are the players?

[00:07:04.610] - Dan
Right. So, that's the first thing you've got this spreadsheet. You've got all here's all the players. Here's all the people. And then those people second step is you've got to figure out of those people who has like if you're going to do like a BC Stack who has a product or could create a product around that idea. So, now you've got two lists; the list of the top people in the running world and then a sub list of just of all of those people who has the product. Right.

[00:07:35.350] - Dan
So, now you've got the list laid out of who you're going to reach out to, because those are the people who have the audience for the running world. Now, this works for quilting, sewing, underwater basket weaving, saving money, finance. It doesn't matter. Everybody's got a niche. There's a there's a spreadsheet you can make. Here's the top players. Here's Dave Ramsey, Suze Orman. Here's the top people in the money world- Pat Flynn. So, make the spreadsheet right.

[00:08:05.230] - Dan
So, now you know who you're going after. These are the people with the big lists, like they either have the big Facebook page, they have the big Twitter, they're the big Instagram. They have a big list. These are the people you want promoting your product.

[00:08:20.120] - Dan
So, now you need to pitch. Pitch is, you've got to figure out what is your product, what is that you're selling? Why would anyone care and how does it help them? How does selling your products help Dave Ramsey? Right. That's a tough. He's got his own products, his own team, his own universe, you know, like four million square foot building. Like, why would it matter to him to sell you a product? All right. So, we got to figure out your pitch. What is it about it that makes them that? Then you've got to have a page, because traditionally when you do a pitch like here's what we do now, we're seven years into BC Stack. So, when I pitch people to be part of the product or to be an affiliate for the product, I can say, "Go to this website and you can see what we've done the last seven years. But the first year you can't do that. So you just have to be persuasive. You have to be you have to understand what it is you're doing. You have to be to talk about it eloquently. You've got to know what the benefit is going to be."

[00:09:23.390] - Dan
Right now, the benefit is often money. In your pitch, the benefit is we're selling a hundred dollar product and an affiliate, you get 50% of the sales or you get 70% or you get 100%, depending on who who you're going after. So and there's no rule for that. Like, if I was going to go after Dave Ramsey, I would say, "Look, we're selling a hundred dollar product and if you market for us, we'll give you a hundred dollars for each sale." I'll decide. I take no money for this because I'm just going to he's going to grow on my list. Huge. I'll make the money next year. But I need a big hook to catch a big fish. So, smaller people, you might be able to say, you know, we're giving 50%. I don't mean smaller people. But, you know, Oprah is not the same as Tom Smedley, guy who's got a little website that gets 10 visitors a day. You know, they're just not the same. So, you got to have your people you're going to go after and then you've got to have your pitch. And then you've got to be able to tell them the benefit and then you need software, so we use A Member, there's Member Mouse.

[00:10:31.110] - Dan
There's- there's a lot of different software for managing an affiliate program. Basically, the software is is the thing that spits out the special link for each person so that when they use the- when they market your product and they have a special link, it gets tracked and they get they get paid.

[00:10:48.390] - Dan
So, you do need software, there's no way of getting around. Oh, wait there is a way to get around. You could create a separate landing page for every single person. So you go to Bloggingconcentrated.com, slash A, slash B, C, D, and whatever sales come out of, each one goes to that specific person. There's no way in the world I would consider doing it. But you. But it's possible you could do that. So, I would use software and A-member is what we use. I think it's a little bit clunky and I think I would like to switch at some point, but I don't know what that would be, what I would be switching to figure that out, because it's worked. It's worked. We've never have had a problem.

[00:11:33.240] - Dan
So, then so you have the software to pitch the people and then you need the landing page. Right. The landing page is basically the sales page. You've got to have a place that you can sell the product. So sometimes it helps to have the landing page built before you pitch people. Would you like to be an affiliate or would you like to be in the product? Because they some people are visual. They like to be able to see what it is. On the very first, one might make sense to have a landing page. This is what it's going to be. Your name is going to be here or this is what you're going to be selling. Here is the buy button like? It might make sense, but if you suck in design, then I would go strictly on the pitch and I wouldn't show you something in case they look at it and be like, "I don't think I want to do that." So make up your mind whether you want to have a landing page ahead of time or not.

[00:12:25.350] - Dan
And then it helps to have a set of prizes. So, the top affiliate gets an extra hundred dollars, gets an iPad with BC stack. We give away $40,000 in prizes. So, the first person gets I think last year 15,000, or 20,000, second person got ten, the third person get five, three to one. And then we had like top prize for Wednesday, an extra thousand top prize for Thursday. There's a lot of- there can be a lot of money involved and the more you get is- I've learned this- the more you give out doesn't necessarily mean you're going to get more people. I don't know why that is like my brain thinks. If we give away 20 thousand dollars, wouldn't everyone want to show up, but it doesn't really work that way. There's a magic number. I don't know. The magic number is. My guess is that if the top prize is around seven, that's a pretty quality number to attract the big fish. I don't think eight attracts more big fish than seven or nine or 10. We started at 20. I think it was a mistake because I think we could have got the same result at end. But now that is out there. This is what we do. So, I feel like I'm stuck with it. But I also wanted to create a long term. Like every year people know that's what happens. So, I don't know prizes, people like prizes.

[00:13:49.130] - Dan
And the prize doesn't necessarily need to be part of the pitch. The prize actually works during the week sales. When you post on your group or on Facebook or wherever the leaderboard, and then you keep flashing the prize and people can see how close they are to it. So they send another email out, they get a little bit competitive. They want to go after it. That's when the prize actually kicks in to help you make more sales.

[00:14:14.630] - Dan
So, if you're going to host your own product first, you need the product, right? Then you need the universal spreadsheet so you know who you're going to pitch. Now, you could certainly just go with your- the people that, you know, like all the people in your world or in your Facebook group or whatever. But I'm going to tell you right now, if you do that, there's going to be a lot incest, meaning there's going to be a lot of people whose lists overlap with other people's lists. So, when everyone markets, you know, there's going to be a third of the people are going to get a message about your product from like nine, 10, 20 different people.

[00:14:47.840] - Dan
Now, my theory has been if I find product- people who have products or people who are going to be affiliates as far away from me as possible, then I'm going to have the most unique lists, because all of these people are going to have- you know, the people in Malaysia who have listened to people in India. Their lists are completely different than the people in the United States. So, I get the most eyeballs on the landing page.

[00:15:15.950] - Dan
So, did we cover all those things? Product-pitch-software-landing page-universe- prizes. Okay, I want to add something that I just remembered. Test.

[00:15:26.690] - Dan
Okay, so. Once the sale begins and you have all these affiliates, you're going to start to see your conversion, your conversion rate. How do you get your conversion rate? Well, you go if you want, you can go to Google Analytics and you can see how many people came to the page and you can go to PayPal and see how many people bought the product. And then the number of people who bought the product divided by the number of who went to the page is how many- what percentage of your pages converted. Right. So, if hundred people went to your product and only 10 people buy a product. Then you have a 10% conversion. I think that you should try to get to 18% which is always our goal. So. Sometimes you got to after the first day, if you're percentages like seven percent, you got to start testing, which means you got to you got to change the headline, you got to change something.

[00:16:18.960] - Dan
If you change too many things, you have no idea it worked. So, sit down with your team wife, your husband, your business partner, and figure out, all right, what would be something we could change that would big if we could change right now and then press, publish and mark the time like 3:33 AM Tuesday morning. All right. It's live and then you start taking the steps from that moment forward again so you can see did it make- did it make any difference. And try to by the end of the week get to 18%. Ours is a week, so yours might be longer than a week. You might have a long time, you could test it out, which would be great, but we get all of our traffic in one week, so we got to test regularly through the week until we have this perfect product.

[00:17:04.570] - Dan
Okay, so that's the host side how to do it. Now, I'm hoping that on your worksheet you can see that. Do you. I'll write, do you have this. And if you don't these are your actions, this is what you need to get, right. This is what you need to work.

[00:17:23.200] - Dan
Now, the other side of the prop of the equation, which you need to be good at, whether you're hosting the product or being affiliate, is affiliate marketing. And that is, maybe you do this already, you're an affiliate for Amazon, you get a link and you put the link on Facebook and you sell the product or whatever. But if you're going to have people being affiliates for your product, you need to be able to teach them how to be an affiliate. All right. And I learned this because in the first year that we did this, there were a few people who chose to be an affiliate and they bought ads that drove people back to the page and they made like no money. And that's not a fault of the page or the ads. I'll explain that.

[00:18:08.390] - Dan
So, there are four parts to being the affiliate, the person who's actually selling the product. So, you're going to be doing this for your own product. You're going to be your own athlete, and then other people are going to be doing it for your or you're going to be doing for someone else. So, you still need to know how to how this works.

[00:18:24.530] - Dan
So, three things that I that I think are important are; honesty, authenticity and presell. And these are totally different things. Even though honesty and authenticity sound the same, they're totally different.

[00:18:39.350] - Dan
Okay, so we're going to start with authentic. I'm going to put number one here so I can write this worksheet, correct? Okay, now being authentic, if you're. This doesn't mean like being yourself or being honest or being truthful. Those are not authentic. You know, authentic is the practice of understanding who your audience is and then making sure that everything you do is to benefit that audience. But also everything that you do is based on you benefiting your audience for your own benefit. Explain what that means. You're in the running, right? Why, I don't know, it just came up twice, so you're in the running and you're going to do a big promotion, so you decide to give away twenty five dollar Amazon gift cards for anybody who will fill out the survey. Right. Well, who shows up to get a twenty five dollar Amazon gift card? Everybody, I shop if you're going to do a menopause survey for a $20 gift card, I'm going to take the menopause. Why? Because I want a $25 gift card. So the moment that you give away a $25 gift card to Amazon, you have blown your authenticity. It's out the window. All you have to do is you have to figure out what you're going to do a survey, you got to figure out what would entice only runners to take the survey. Right. So, maybe it's a. Twenty five dollar gift card to a running store, right to New Balance.com. New Balance.com/running. So then like, I don't want a $25 gift card to menopause results.com, I'm not going to fill out that survey. That is not of interest to me. So, you need to make sure that your prize for filling out a survey has directly related to drugs because that becomes your audience right in your list and those are the people that you're going to be selling other people's products to. So, once it's not related to running, then all of a sudden your clickthrough rate goes down, you're unsubscribes go down nobody's paying attention on Facebook because you weren't authentic. You didn't create an environment where only runners your show so, they can talk about their questions and answers and feel safe in that environment; you haven't built that. You're no longer an authentic market.

[00:21:18.770] - Dan
Okay, so now if you're doing affiliate marketing, any of you have done this, you have been authentic, you've been only working in the running niche, you've only done things that would benefit them. You've only built lists of people who are interested in that. Then you want to find running products that you can talk to your list about as an affiliate. You want to find a running book, you want to find a running movie that you can talk about. Some of them will make you money and some of them won't. You have to be to the point where, yes, I want my audience to see this movie. I don't care if I'm making money, I'm going to promote it. And then you got to find other products that actually make you. Because the second part is honesty. You have to be at all times, I am the person that you want to go to to learn about running or to learn about blogging or to learn about finance. So, I'm going to tell you which movies you don't want, which movies you do need to watch, which books you do need to read, which books you don't need to read. I'm going to be that person. I'm going to be honest with my audience.

[00:22:20.410] - Dan
So, with your affiliate marketing, you've got to find products that totally fit that path of honesty. So, if if you were in the blogging world, like the blogging niche and you saw BC Stack, BC Stack has  got sixty five courses, classes, memberships, all about blogging, then I would think this would be perfect for your audience because now they can learn about all these different topics for one tiny little price. Right. This would help your audience immensely because sixty five different things all have to do with building a better, a better blog. And then at the same time, because your audience needs it and you can talk about it honestly. You also make money from it as the affiliate. So, you have to be super honest. You if you don't think your audience needs that, then you should be able to say, I don't think you guys need this. And hopefully that means the next thing that you tell them about that they do need, you're even more believable or they understand, like "Hey, the last time you saved me some money and told me not to get that because that was a waste of time." But now he's saying I should get this, but it must not be a waste of time, because not only if it is a waste of time, you tell him not to get it. So you become that actual honest voice to your audience.

[00:23:39.310] - Dan
And then when you're actually decided, "I built this great audience and now I'm going to sell a product." If you want to make money like you actually want to be a successful affiliate, you have to be. Like this is called the presell, you have to you have to send a message that sells the product before they get to the page. So, some people who were "We tried to teach BC Stack over the years, some people have said, hey, I found this great deal, it's sixty five products for thirty nine dollars. I think you should check it out, click the link." Now, that means that you've basically taken your audience and you've given them something that you're curious about and willing to go look at it. Now, My landing Page is not designed to persuade you to buy it. It's like, "Okay, here's BC stack, here's all in it, and here's the buy button."

[00:24:39.200] - Dan
So, if an affiliate doesn't presell, like, tell me exactly what I need and all those things, then the page doesn't work. You don't make any money. So, if you're going to be an affiliate, you've got to go look at the page. Right. You've got to go look at the page that you're sending traffic to, you have to look at all the benefits you've got and hopefully you bought it or you know it or you've got information on it. You've got to see what the page is missing. Right. And then when you're telling about the product to your audience, you have to tell them everything here is who it's for. Here's who it is not for. Here's how long it will take to do it. Here's what you will learn. Here's why I think you should get it. Here's why I think you shouldn't get it. If you're you know, if you're X, Y, Z, I don't think you need this because like all those things, it should be you should totally be able to sell the product because you get it. You know who it's for. You know, it's not for, you know, the benefits. If it's something that comes in the mail, you know how it arrives, you know how long it takes. If it's a course, you know how long it will take them to get to the meat of the course, how long will take them to get the benefit of the course. Like you put that all in your message and then you say, "If this sounds like you, if this is exactly what you need, then click and go buy." Right. Then they go to the landing page and they don't have to be pretty sold. They don't have to depend upon- you don't to depend upon somebody else's landing page to make the sale. I hope that makes sense.

[00:26:07.790] - Dan
So, as an affiliate to to be an affiliate one, you want to either have somebody who has a list that's totally authentic list, or you want to find people who find people with authentic. Meaning, that's all- that's all you've seen them do. You haven't seen the market YouTube products one day and then a finance product the next day and then some Walgreens thing that they did a sponsored post for the day after that. Like what kind of audits have they built? Ridiculous. And if that's you and that's what you've done, then I would say you need to for 2021, for 2022 whatever you need to figure out. You need to figure out yourself. You got to figure out what is it you're building, what kind of an audience are you building, what kind of product list? If you're not building an audience that's all focused on one thing, then how are you going to sell to them? How are you going to not sell to them like unsell to tell- them things they don't need? Because obviously they won't even think they're on the ROI list of them, not on there for the right reason.

[00:27:10.320] - Dan
Now, for some of you who are lifestyle bloggers, who write about raising kids and saving money and best fashion and coupons or whatever lifestyle, so you still have one focus, right? You don't teach Spanish. You're not teaching world currencies like you have a focus. And that focus might be women in who have kids from basically from 3 to 16. That might be your your people. So, as long as your "people" fall in that you've got an authentic list. It doesn't matter if you're talking about those different very topics within that niche. Your people become the niche. Moms with little kids to older kids that's my niche. So you can talk about anything in the area. So, then when you talk to them, you can say, hey, if you're a mom of a 15 year old, you don't need this product. But if you're a mom with a three year old, you do need this product. See what I mean? So, when you're talking to audience, you can totally relate to them. So, make sure that you find people who have what you need to grow your list, because as the person who's hosting the product, you also need to be authentic.

[00:28:17.160] - Dan
So, you don't need if you're selling a broad product, you don't need someone in the running niche to send an email out to their running community to see if anyone out there is a blogger. Like you don't actually need that. I mean, it sounds it sounds enticing, but you don't really need that. You just need people who've built a business on bloggers or on runners. That should be your world.

[00:28:41.760] - Dan
I just bumped the table.

[00:28:41.760] - Dan
Okay, so I'm hoping that makes sense. There's two sides to affiliate market. The first side is posting the product and then finding affiliates to actually sell the product for you. And then the second site is, being affiliate and you're either selling other people's products or you're selling your own product to make money for your audience. And hopefully- on the second part, if you're an affiliate on your worksheet, if you're trying to sell products to other people, I've listed in the presell, the things that you need to have in every blog post or every message about the park so that you can accurately you know, you can actually presell and get people to want to buy it before they click a button. So, that would be your action item, is to find something that you can you can sell and then go out and write all the information about that product. Do it once. Find something on Amazon and then go through this list and write a blog post, all of those things in the blog post about that one product and then see if you can sell it. That would be great.

[00:29:45.540] - Dan
Otherwise, we would love to have you as an affiliate, at BCstack.com. We actually teach an eight hour course on how to do that. It's about eight minutes long course, there's a lot involved. There's a lot more than than just this is the nuts, nuts and bolts. But each one of those things has 20 tasks. So, we'd love to have you take a look at that if you're interested in doing a product.

[00:30:13.030] - Dan
Otherwise. Good luck with your blogging world, hoping that everything that you're doing is actually creating an income. And it's what's providing the food on your table at your house. Rachel and I have been doing this for ten years, eight years, nine years, somewhere down there, full time. We work from home. We make all our money basically through PayPal, which is kind of crazy because putting all your eggs in one basket. I might actually change that now that I said that out loud. She runs Findingjoy.net. Through that- through the authenticity of creating a motherhood site where she only talks to moms we got the attention of Penguin Random House and she got a book deal a couple of years ago and did the Today Show and all that stuff. It all came because she focused on one thing.

Now, like I said before, you might focus on a lot of things within that one concept, but she focused on that one concept. So, we're probably going to work on another book this year, maybe. I think we might pitch out another book. But we didn't hit the New York Times bestseller for the first book, so I haven't quite figured out if I want to make a run with the first book again and really go nontraditional and try to become a New York best seller like three years after it's published, which is possible. Or if we're going to go for a second book, we're just not sure on that yet. And then Blogging Concentrated, which I think or changing the name to Audience Industries is now- the covid thing kind of made it difficult this year to do workshops, but I imagine going to start doing virtual workshops in 2021. And look forward to seeing all of you there.
