Liz Stapleton [00:00:00]:
Alright, guys. Thank you for joining me and Jessie on a journey for this session. I'm super excited. We kinda twin-ed and we didn't even mean to. so, Jessie, thank you for for agreeing to do this. I'm super pumped to learn from you today.

Jessie Festa [00:00:14]:
Yeah. Thank you so much for having me.

Liz Stapleton [00:00:16]:
Yeah. So, you know, you're a travel blogger, which is I always, like, envy a little bit because I do not get to travel nearly as much as I want to. and you're based in New York, which is also pretty awesome.

Jessie Festa [00:00:29]:
How do

Liz Stapleton [00:00:30]:
I what I kind of love about your site too is you're not, like, only on the go as you you do your trips and stuff, but you've been blogging since 2011. It's been at it a long time and today we're gonna be talking about how to grow and nurture a community. so why don't you kind of give us the highlights of of your thoughts on this topic and then we'll dive in with some questions

Jessie Festa [00:00:53]:
Yeah. So I have, you know, a lot of students and a lot of bloggers in my community, people who are trying to create their own location independent businesses travel more while also earning an income. And the one thing I see a lot that I would consider a big mistake is especially with travelers because they're writing about their trips. They're very me, me, me. Oh, I did this. I I did that. And, a, they're not really thinking about how those posts will benefit somebody else or even what they will lead to in terms of benefits. Like, they're writing about their trip, but they're not thinking about, okay, how is this going to grow my social media following my email list, get me sales, get me affiliate clicks. They're sort of just trying to create content and hope that it goes somewhere. so that's one big mistake. And then the other big mistake tying back to not really having an idea of how your content will benefit somebody else is I see a lot of travel bloggers specifically because that's my audience, but just bloggers in general the same, not having a mission, not having a thing that they're trying to achieve or a way that they're trying to help a community. So those are a few things I think are important to consider when you are starting a blog of any niche if you want to grow a community. Yeah.

Liz Stapleton [00:02:12]:
And and a community is important because those are the people that are gonna make your blog a business, really. And in

Jessie Festa [00:02:20]:
the travel blogging space, it's interesting because maybe some a bit in the lifestyle space too, but press trips and working with brands is really big for travel bloggers. And it's also a big way I make money as well. But I think a lot of bloggers starting out but also intermediate are really focused on, oh, I wanna work with brands. Oh, I wanna have this Instagram following. when I actually feel like the more sustainable way is to build the community and then work with the brands that benefit the community, create products that benefit the community, work with affiliates that benefit the community. And I'll type just, yeah, tie everything back to that. Absolutely. And, like, sponsors and, and, you know, affiliates, they're gonna wanna work with you because you

Liz Stapleton [00:03:01]:
have engaged, audience. Exactly. -- engagement that matters, not necessarily the numbers. It's kinda like people chasing traffic for display ad revenue, which is like, yeah, you can make money that way, but you're not gonna build a business on typically. Yeah. which so I left. So you have been blogging a long time. So out of curiosity, did growing a community come quickly for you, or was that sort of you made some of those same mistakes? And then, like, how did that?

Jessie Festa [00:03:29]:
so many mistakes, but I would say in 2011, the, like, the landscape of blogging was so different. getting paid to work with brands and specifically for travel bloggers, getting paid to go on press trips was unheard of. even like the idea of creating products, like, that kinda came to me pretty quick. Mhmm. I started creating courses, I wanna say, in, like, 2012 or

Jessie Festa [00:03:52]:
13. Okay.

Jessie Festa [00:03:54]:
Just because a lot of people were asking me, oh, how are you making money on this? How do I start a blog? So I sort of saw an opportunity there.

Liz Stapleton [00:04:03]:
Yeah. Your community kind of reached out to you about those things.

Jessie Festa [00:04:08]:
Exactly. And I I always keep a spreadsheet still. of what people are asking me, comments, DMs, emails, all that stuff. What do people want for me? That's even I also, sell photo tours in New York City.

Jessie Festa [00:04:20]:
Yes. Same

Jessie Festa [00:04:20]:
thing. Just so many people asking me to show them around New York. I'm like, okay. I never thought it'd be a tour guide, but Let me create something, and that's, like, a huge, huge moneymaker for me. And it's something I love too, because I know it's something that people want and enjoy. but yeah, back in 2011, I feel like it was more sort of like quick sponsored posts. I wasn't really thinking about community. I was just sort of trying to figure out what blogging was. To be honest, like, in

Jessie Festa [00:04:45]:
2010,

Jessie Festa [00:04:47]:
I didn't even know what a blogging was. I just knew that I loved travel, and I saw other people creating blogs once I started doing research. And I was like, oh, let me figure out this whole blog thing and see what that is. But -- Yep.

Liz Stapleton [00:04:58]:
--

Jessie Festa [00:04:59]:
like, I didn't grow up with, like I'm a millennial, but I'm the elder millennial. Yeah. Yeah.

Jessie Festa [00:05:04]:
So I

Jessie Festa [00:05:04]:
didn't grow up with social media and all that stuff. So this was all very, very new to me, like, people think, oh, you, you know, you're pretty young. You probably, like, grew up with an an iPhone and Facebook all that with. Yeah.

Liz Stapleton [00:05:18]:
Like, I watched my first YouTube video, my junior year of college.

Jessie Festa [00:05:24]:
about that, but still, like, when I started this blog, there was no Instagram. Also, like, Twitter was the biggest thing in my opinion. Yeah. Yeah. It was so different.

Liz Stapleton [00:05:33]:
Yeah. No. Totally. It's it's it's weird when you think about how much it's taken over our lives. So I was like, Yeah. Facebook started in college, and it was only colleges. And it was, you know, it was -- It was,

Jessie Festa [00:05:42]:
like, for parties and stuff. Yeah. Yeah.

Liz Stapleton [00:05:45]:
It was completely there. It was like, who's in your classes? But, yeah, so okay. So, obviously, the landscape has changed a bit. So what have over your many years of blogging is sort of what strategies have you found work well and sort of growing a community when you decide to fit that first? I think you said you start with the mission.

Jessie Festa [00:06:03]:
Yeah. So I did kinda start with a mission unintentionally. I was the solo female traveler. I basically in college plan this big backpacking trip 3 York for the summer with my some of my sorority sisters, and then I spent so much time planning this. I was so excited. And then as the trip got closer and closer and it got time to actually book the flights, everyone backed out, and I had to make that decision. Like, do I give up the hours and hours and research that I've done and the excitement that I feel, or do I just do this by myself? So I went by myself and that really, like, changed everything for me, in a good way. And now pretty much that's I'm engaged, and I still, like, usually I'm traveling by myself because my fiance is a teacher. So pretty much every month or every 2 months I go on a trip, usually solo. And when I started, I wanted to help women confidently travel solo, give them good information on how to travel solo, basically give them the resources that I had a lot of trouble finding when I was planning my trips. Yeah. So I didn't really go into it thinking like, oh, I need a mission statement. I need to help people. Yeah. But looking back on it, I'm like, oh, I'm glad that I unintentionally did have a mission. Yeah. I think it's a very good thing to have.

Liz Stapleton [00:07:14]:
Yeah. And then once you kinda clearly figured out that that was your mission, it made it easier to create content and focus to grow your communities that you're saying.

Jessie Festa [00:07:22]:
Exactly. And it has shifted over the years because I feel like I have become more of, you know, the blogging space. I've created so many courses and freebies and I speak at conferences on blogging. So now it's very much sort of like living your best life through travel, realizing that there are other avenues for you, not just, you know, go to college, get married, do the 9 to

Jessie Festa [00:07:46]:
5,

Jessie Festa [00:07:46]:
which is nothing wrong with that at all. I think that's a great time. Yeah. But just knowing that there's other options, even like with the solo travel thing, I still have so many friends, even though they see me do it, they're like, oh, I don't know if I could do that. I'm like, You can. Trust me. Go to my website.

Liz Stapleton [00:08:01]:
I'll -- I'm like, if I could figure it out, you could, because I was not I'm not techie.

Jessie Festa [00:08:07]:
like this, whether you're trying to travel sort of business, you wanna be more location independent. Like, I just really want people to see that Anything is possible. It's not just what you're told is what you're supposed to do. Like, there's so many other options.

Liz Stapleton [00:08:21]:
Yeah. Absolutely. And I love that you kinda started in the, like, female solo travel. Like bloggers like you, or I went on my first solo international trip in 2018 yeah, last year, 2018, well, 2 years ago. Oh, man. Like, I'd I'd, like, studied abroad and stuff, and I technically, like, didn't know people I got there, but that's different than, like, going somewhere by yourself. you're not meeting up with, like, an arranged group or something. So and then I went again on another one last year as I'm like, hey, every year, I'm just gonna do, like, a nice little international trip by myself somewhere.

Jessie Festa [00:08:53]:
It's nice. And I feel like it does, like it helps you kinda grow your relationship with yourself. Also, you don't have to compromise your itinerary at all. You can really look pick everything that you wanna do. Just some benefits, I would say.

Liz Stapleton [00:09:04]:
Yeah. No. I absolutely love it. it's it's fantastic. but back to, like, the blogging side of things. so once you kind of have that mission, sort of, what steps did you take to kind of implement it? Or, you know, like, what did you look at doing to, you know, reach that mission, I guess.

Jessie Festa [00:09:22]:
Yeah. So along with, listening to my audience, keeping that spreadsheet always keeping track of what people are asking me. I think it's really helpful to find some places online that your audience is hanging out, like Facebook groups and, niche Reddit forums. Probably, I don't really use Quoara, but I know a lot of other people use that and just seeing what people are asking there, what problems they have, what questions they're asking where you can kind of dig and find those problems. Yep. And that'll give you a good idea of like, okay. There's a lot of people who need help with x. Let me create some blog posts, some videos, social media content. But the thing is once you have that mission, and then you figure out some of those problems, it just becomes so much easier to know what to write. Like I know in the travel space, a lot of bloggers, you go on a trip and there's You can write about the food. You can write about the the safety aspect. You can write about the hotels. Like, there's so many options within that trip. Yeah. You have a mission. You'll just really know, like, okay, my audience is really into slow travel. They're really into responsible tourism. They're really into luxury hotels. which is known. It'll be so much easier to create a space online where you are the expert on that topic.

Liz Stapleton [00:10:34]:
Yeah. So so quality market research really, which is not the most fun term, but that's pretty much what we're doing. Yeah. Definitely. So did was there in girl, you know, in in figuring this stuff out where there's specific strategies you tried that didn't work? Fell flat? Yeah.

Jessie Festa [00:10:53]:
I'm sure there was, like, one thing. Nothing I would say this is falling flat, but, like, we were talking about a little bit before we went live, like, growing the email list. I think it's the best thing you could do really focusing on that. I would say a mistake for me was I didn't start growing. My email is probably till, like, maybe 3 years ago is when I really started.

Liz Stapleton [00:11:12]:
So I

Jessie Festa [00:11:12]:
missed it out on a few years of Yeah. Really. Yeah. Doing that. and I was always told you from my email list, but it didn't click for me. I'm like, well,

Liz Stapleton [00:11:21]:
people say, oh, you need to grow a list, but they don't explain why or what you do with it. bucks.

Jessie Festa [00:11:25]:
Yeah. So I'm like, what do I do? Just, like, share links to my blog post. I could do that on Facebook. So I just, like, didn't get it. But, One thing I'll say when I first learned about the whole, like create something free to get people on your list and you can nurture them. I thought it had to be the most complex, crazy thing ever that I would have to create. I created, like, so many really complicated things that took me a long time and didn't even convert that well. My best converting opt in is a PDF. It's a list of influencer networks for travel bloggers took me a day or

Jessie Festa [00:12:00]:
2

Jessie Festa [00:12:01]:
to create. And by far, it's still my best option. And I'm like, oh, wow. Sometimes, like, The most effective thing isn't the most complicated. It's just the thing that people really want.

Liz Stapleton [00:12:11]:
Yeah. Yeah. Simple. oftentimes wins out over an complication.

Jessie Festa [00:12:15]:
Yeah. It's like a quick win. Like, it's a list they can read really quickly. They don't have to watch a lot of videos or anything like that. that was a big lesson for me because I feel like I did kind of waste a lot of time trying to create things that, yeah, just didn't convert well, but really spent a lot of time on them.

Liz Stapleton [00:12:31]:
Yeah. No, same. I've I've I've done it, Shacey. So hopefully the people that are in the sort of beginner space on this summit or learning from our mistakes. Don't go through that. okay. So so failing to do an email list and book were you focused more on social media before you did that then?

Jessie Festa [00:12:50]:
Yeah. Definitely. like I said, when I started, there was no Instagram, no I'm not on TikTok now, but I'd like to keep hearing from talk about TikTok. it was Facebook and Twitter. So I was doing a lot of Twitter chats. I actually had my own Twitter chat for a while. There wasn't Facebook groups, so it was like my Facebook page. Yeah. I'm just really trying to, yeah, connect with people there. I'll say being on Twitter, it's still my favorite channel, like, for fun. Okay. I don't get a lot of traffic or conversions there, so I'll Personally, I don't spend a ton of time on Twitter, but it's so good, I would say, for making connections in the industry. Like, I've met so many other bloggers through that. I'm definitely thankful for Twitter. kinda like learning the culture of each platform, I'd say. Like, each one has its own benefits. And I don't think you need to be everywhere. I think you could say, like, you know what? This one's good for that, but do I really need that? This is what I'm really trying to see. Like, where can I do that?

Liz Stapleton [00:13:44]:
Yeah. It it goes back to your mission, like you said. You know, where where is it gonna be best to grow that community?

Jessie Festa [00:13:51]:
and I get a lot of people who especially again in the travel space. Instagram is the thing. Yeah. And they wanna figure out how to grow traffic from Instagram, and it's not that you can't. I get some okay traffic, but it's like, if you think about the culture of Instagram where people are scrolling, they're not really clicking away, and then you think about Pinterest, or even Facebook where people do click away, it's gonna make a lot more sense if you wanna grow your traffic to be on Pinterest where people are literally scrolling to click away. Yeah. Or even or even YouTube or something.

Liz Stapleton [00:14:21]:
because -- Exactly. Yeah. Even Pinterest are more certain than social media because I feel like Instagram is, like, You follow them because you're fans of them. You're not necessarily clicking over, but they're part of your tribe. That's where you can get them under email list. You know, it's not like a regular traffic drive. to your content. But, yeah, okay. Then I just say you wanna you want even more inside stuff than than actually click once to go join my email

Jessie Festa [00:14:48]:
Yeah. Yeah. And most of my good clicks, I believe come from my bio. Like, I have a link in my bio that I track with different, I don't use Linktree. I actually basically created a Linktree on my own page just to get the traffic to my site. Yeah. I can track it because it's just there. That's the only place. And, you know, like, in a share and Instagram, they don't really let you link, so it makes sense that that would be where the most of the links are coming from. Some of the swipe ups, but yeah.

Liz Stapleton [00:15:17]:
Gotcha. okay. So what's one thing you've kind of note? Cause you have been in the blogging game a long time. by blogging standards. what are some of the things you've noticed changed over time? Obviously, social media landscape has changed and continues change. I don't think people like me. I'll ever figure out TikTok or why I would use it, but well, it's like it's generally confident. But, you know, so how have things changed over time where, you know, if you were starting today, do things differently.

Jessie Festa [00:15:49]:
I would say that when I started 2011 bloggers, like, I would never tell anyone I was a blogger. I don't remember what I would call myself. and I know even today there are some, you know, negative connotations depending who you're talking to, but it really was so new and so strange that, like, if you pitched a brand of partnership, even if you had amazing traffic, it still was like, oh, like a blogger, we'd No. Like, you're not a real journalist, basically. It was a thought. Yeah. So I feel like one of the biggest changes is that now a blog is considered an actual business, which is great, and also in that same idea, bloggers are starting to actually run their blogs more like businesses, like having products. I always tell my students that they should really consider having their own product at some point. like I said, a lot of them wanna work with brands of, like, the big exciting thing, which is very lucrative, but you really don't have full control. You can meet a brand. It's the best fit, but they don't have a budget or they've used up their budget or whatever. You have no control over that, where you do have control over growing your email list or whatever, growing your social media, wherever you can kind of grow your community. And then, you know, the larger you can grow your community, Hopefully, the more sales we can make on your product. Like, for me, I do see pretty steady arrow up. The more I grow my email list, the more my income grows with my product. And I do have control over that because there's strategies that I'm like, this works really well. Mhmm. Let me do that again. Like, webinars, like, I love creating videos for social media and then pairing it with an opt in that does really well, running Facebook ads. So these are things I know work really well, and I can just keep repeating them.

Liz Stapleton [00:17:39]:
Yeah. I I mean, I think everyone that kinda likes the idea of working with companies, but at the same time, that's not nearly as scalable. Right? It's it's a lot of instances. It's like a 1 and done. you know, which can be great when you're starting out and you're still trying to grow that and so that income from products or affiliate or whatever is not a lot. but I feel like the longer you're in it, the less partnerships like that you tend to do because it's it's kinda it's one and done. Like, it's it's great. It's fine, but I think I've only ever done, like, 2 because it's like,

Jessie Festa [00:18:15]:
Yeah. I do. I do work with brands a lot. Like, I've I actually have a have a course on it. Yeah. But I could say, like, Don't make the only thing. Like, somebody -- Yeah. Absolutely.

Liz Stapleton [00:18:24]:
Yeah. Yeah. And I I'm I mean, I just I would be very picky about too. Like, you really wanna make sure they're the right partnerships. Like, they can be fantastic. I think it's I see partnerships done really well, or I'm like, that's awesome. you know, but I've seen them done really poorly too.

Jessie Festa [00:18:41]:
The thing, if if it's the only thing you're doing, how can you be picky? It's like how you're gonna eat unless you just see us everything. And that's the thing too. and even, like, for my sponsored content, my rate is probably much higher than most people's, but that's because I'm not trying to do them all the time. And I do sometimes at brands who are like, you know, oh, that's so much higher than, like, you know, everyone else. I'm like, well, There are people who pay it, and we have really great partnerships because it's a great fit. I can put the time into really creating amazing content, promoting it, and all this stuff that I think is necessary to have a great partnership, 1st, quickly know, getting something out there and then forgetting about it and not having time to do the analytics and all that stuff. So

Liz Stapleton [00:19:23]:
-- Yeah. No. And that's a great point is I think people miss that when it comes to sponsorships. It's a little bit off topic, but they, you know, they think it's when done. But if you can show sort of the results for the brand, like, that's open additional partnering with that brand. later on.

Jessie Festa [00:19:38]:
One thing I definitely hear a lot from, like, the brands I work with is, that like, the analytic, like, a lot of bloggers won't send back the analytics. So they're sort of, like, left in the dark with a lot of that information, and that's what brand wants to know, like, how did this work out?

Liz Stapleton [00:19:55]:
Yeah.

Jessie Festa [00:19:56]:
So you're sort of letting the brand down a little bit, but also making the PR person's life a lot harder too.

Liz Stapleton [00:20:02]:
Yeah. Yeah. And and showing, hey. This did well. Let's do, you know, something else again in the future is another thing. And then the other space I feel like when it comes to brand partnerships, a lot of bloggers fail on is not having a contract. So just --

Jessie Festa [00:20:15]:
That's right.

Liz Stapleton [00:20:15]:
Yeah. -- very important. Just to touch

Jessie Festa [00:20:18]:
on. included in it too. Exactly.

Liz Stapleton [00:20:21]:
Yeah. okay. So so back to more community building type of topic, so kind of once you are growing because there's obviously grow, grow, grow, you know, what do you do to kind of nurture your community? and kind of keep it a community as opposed to just people you sell it to. Right? It's it's more than that. Yeah.

Jessie Festa [00:20:43]:
So I have used Gary Vaynerchuk. I think he's the first one who said the the give give give ask kind of idea. And then I just adapt that to my email. basically, I create 3 emails that are just pure giving. Usually, I'm teaching a strategy. Maybe I create a video and I put it in the email, maybe I share about a free giveaway, but I'm not asking for anything in return. the one thing I do pretty much always do in my emails is I ask a question at the end. because then I can get to know my audience more, you know, the what problems they have. we can connect on a deeper level, grows that relationship, which is really, really powerful. And then in the 4th email, I might pitch an affiliate or pitch a product. You know, just trying to keep that balance so that when I do share a product. Like, I say, oh, hey, my membership is open for, enrollment. They're not like, oh, she's always selling. It's like, no. She I'm giving, giving, giving, giving, I'm giving really good information. I'm not holding back. And then they know at that point, like, okay. She, you know, she really cares. And that's something I actually do get from my community a lot with this strategy is they feel like I genuinely do care, and that's pretty much the best compliment that I could get. because I do I do really really care. And, yeah, I just think about that while I'm writing my email. I just kind of picture my ideal audience member sitting in front of me, what do they need to know, and how can I tell them step by step in the easiest way in the most clear way how they can solve this problem. So my goal is that with each email, I'm helping them solve some problem in their lives. and even with the sales emails, I'm always telling some kind of story. Maybe I'm even still teaching a strategy. Like, I still want them to open it and feel like they enjoyed reading that email.

Liz Stapleton [00:22:32]:
Mhmm. Yeah. It I mean, because e email as much as it gets a bad rap here and there, it really is you know, people do check it. Right? They don't always They do digital detox where they're not on social media. Mhmm. They don't I don't check DMs. You know, like, but email, email gets checked. It's it's actually a really great platform, especially if you're you're treating your people like people and, you know, not just dollar signs or, you know, I don't even know if some of the other kind of approaches people take, but I feel like the ones that really nail it you know, it's because they they are building a community like you said.

Jessie Festa [00:23:11]:
Yeah. And I think it's like, you know, telling stories. It's huge. I'm always thinking, like, even if say, like, you know, in a launch, you usually have an FAQ email. Usually at the beginning, I'm like, okay, what story could I tell go with this. Like, I want it to be fun and engaging email. I don't just want it to be, hey, like, the sale ends at 10. Like, here's some questions you might have, which think that could be beneficial too. You are answering people's questions, but I think you can be a little bit more creative. And I also think too when you can add in the stories, Have fun with it. It's it feels better. Like, I just feel more creative. Like, I enjoy it more, and I genuinely actually really love writing emails. They do it live in New York City. So, like, on the subway a lot, I'll just kinda, like, write emails, think about what I might wanna say. Yeah. It's fun.

Liz Stapleton [00:23:57]:
Yeah. No. It's it's it's fine because the session I reported yesterday Amanda Page was pretty much about in injecting stories into your content makes it uniquely yours because there's lots of travel bloggers out there. There's lots of personal finance bloggers. There's lots of, you know, lifestyle or fashion, you know, but why people go to your content is the stories you tell because you're not just throwing out you know, the questions or the 10 tips on this, you know, because they can get that anywhere.

Jessie Festa [00:24:24]:
And I think too that goes with

Jessie Festa [00:24:26]:
the, like, building a community because why will someone wanna hear my excerpts over somebody else's. Yeah. because I have my own unique stories. I have my own unique style. I do write in a very obviously write how I talk. Yeah. and I do that on purpose. Maybe it's not always the perfect grammar or whatever, but I want it to feel like we're having a conversation.

Liz Stapleton [00:24:46]:
Yeah. Talking with someone is supposed to at somebody. Exactly. Yeah. No. I love it. okay. So what would you kind of say is, like, your your top piece of advice for bloggers who are, you know, maybe they've been out a while, and they're new to it, and they're just not seeing a lot of traction when it comes to building the community. what kind of advice would you give them?

Jessie Festa [00:25:07]:
I would say, you know, really try to picture that end goal and then think about kind of work backwards. What you need to do to get there. Don't think about every single thing that you wanna do, but say, you know, like, For me, a big goal this year is growing my membership to over I mean, this is the big goal, like, over a thousand numbers. That would be my big, big goal. So what do I need to do to make that happen and kind of work backwards without, getting sidetracked, which is really tricky? what I like to do is I basically will break up however many months and say, okay. This month, I need to complete this and how can I break that up into basically 4 kind of sprints. So it's kind of how I organize myself. but also a lot of it comes down to mindset. And I notice with my membership, I do these 15 minute onboarding calls. So I get to know people a little bit more, and I can say every few people, they'll come out with a lot of, kind of like money blocks, but also ways mentally that I think they're already holding themselves back. For example, I'll often talk to people who say, oh, you know, I don't even need to be doing this because my husband makes so much money, but just something I'm like maybe hoping can happen or, you know, oh, I want this to happen, but if it doesn't, I don't care, but it I think it's almost like

Liz Stapleton [00:26:32]:
Yeah. Yeah.

Jessie Festa [00:26:34]:
Exactly. And I think it's like, I

Jessie Festa [00:26:36]:
I think most people have heard that quote whether you think you can or you think you can't, you're right. Mhmm. I think that's so true. so I think, you know, maybe first before you even put any strategy into practice, really sit with yourself and think about what kind of negative self talk you have and figuring out why that is. And then reminding yourself of your own unique abilities and maybe things you accomplished in the past. I know for me, that's like a huge thing I did last year.

Liz Stapleton [00:27:05]:
Yeah.

Jessie Festa [00:27:05]:
Like, really focusing on mindset and thinking about kind of the ways I hold myself back the excuses I make and why that is and how I can change that. but yeah, even beyond that, I think basically starting with that end goal and saying, okay. Here's what I need to do before I reach that. And I I also realize that a lot of people They start blogging and they wanna start making money right away. Not that that can't happen, but if you think about any business, like, if you were gonna open a bakery, you'd be out six figures and you would have a loss for a while. So This is still a business. You're lucky that it's a blog and it has lower overhead. Yeah. But it will take some time to first bill. It's a lot.

Liz Stapleton [00:27:51]:
You know, I always kinda think if you can make it through the 1st year and you're still being consistent, like, you're probably gonna make it. you know, I feel like most people that that don't stick with blogging, they fall off in the 1st year. So --

Jessie Festa [00:28:03]:
Exactly. Yeah. And I think too, like, a

Jessie Festa [00:28:05]:
lot of people I talk to, they're like, I just started my blog yesterday. I wanna work with a brand. Do you think I should pitch them? And I'm like, What is your brand? What's your mission? you know, what kind of content will help this audience that you have in mind? How are you gonna get people to view this content, and then how are you gonna convert them onto your email list, and then how are you gonna nurture them? I think that's like a, you know, a very short way to put, like, a strategy together. Yeah. But, yeah, basically You need to start first. You need to know who you are. You need to confidently be able to tell potential customers, potential partners, what you do and what makes you unique before I think you really wanna start creating products and working with brands and all that kind of stuff.

Liz Stapleton [00:28:56]:
Yeah. Absolutely. And, you know, and that kind of goes back to the mindset too of, like, having, you know, clear idea in mind. And I just wanted to add on the flip side, you were like, think about whatever negatives I'll talk to you, but also think about because sometimes it's a fear of success. Definitely. Like, okay. What's the worst thing that's gonna happen if you succeed? you know, because there are those fears, oh, am I gonna, like, get sued if I'm being noticed? Am I gonna, you know, so so don't don't forget to recognize those well. Like, maybe it's not negative self talk holding you back. Maybe it's a fear of success that you kind of break down and get some, you know, get some perspective. But, yeah, okay. That, I mean, that was fantastic. It was like notes. so kind of final question I guess I have for you is is there any sort of advice you see out there a lot that you feel should be ignored? that you're like?

Jessie Festa [00:29:49]:
Actually, I got an email yesterday from one of my students that I was sort of like Really, I don't agree with this at all. She was told by someone that she should be focusing solely on Instagram and that blogs are gonna be obsolete, which I'm I'm like, I feel like if anything, any how many channels will go under before websites are anything, Yeah.

Liz Stapleton [00:30:12]:
Yeah. That's the list. Yeah.

Jessie Festa [00:30:14]:
Yeah. Like, we've seen with Vine and Google Plus. Like, these people with these huge audiences lost them or had to get them over to another platform. Whereas, like, your website, you could have everything. You could have your social media on there, your products, your videos, posts like your leads locked in and your posts and your pages are going to show up in Google whereas you know that instagram may be gets a lot of traction when you post it, but eventually it's gonna go down your feed. So I don't know if this is in every space, but at least in the travel space, and I think the lifestyle space There's this idea that Instagram is literally everything. If you don't have a big Instagram following, you can't have a successful business. That is not true at all. Yeah.

Liz Stapleton [00:30:55]:
I feel like that exists too in, like, the YouTube space.

Jessie Festa [00:30:58]:
Like, of

Liz Stapleton [00:30:59]:
course, you know, a lot of them don't have sites and that's fine. They're doing great, but, like, if YouTube changes their algorithm or their, you know, it's one of those things that you don't have total control over. It's good to have that as well. You know?

Jessie Festa [00:31:13]:
I mean, even look at, the I think it's pronounced Kappa, the children's protection laws,

Liz Stapleton [00:31:19]:
Mhmm.

Jessie Festa [00:31:20]:
I'm not big on YouTube, but I've been listening to a lot of the YouTubers I follow. And, essentially, a lot of the, from what I understand, people who are making a lot of money promoting things that might be child friendly are now gonna be pretty demonetized because they don't wanna put ads on these. basically, they don't wanna put ads on ads to children. Yeah. So if you were say a YouTuber who was making a ton of money, maybe reviewing toys or something like that you potentially just lost a lot of income. So algorithms and laws like that do change. As I think with the website, you can just do so much more because it's not just your YouTube videos. It's not just your Instagram shares. It's your entire business. Like, your blog is your online brick and mortar. Like, that's what I always think of it as. My storefront is my website.

Liz Stapleton [00:32:08]:
You're the second speaker so far to say,

Jessie Festa [00:32:11]:
So -- Really? Yeah.

Liz Stapleton [00:32:14]:
So so, no, I like it. but, yeah, no, I think I think that's perfect example of of what we're talking about. and so for, you know, this, I mean, I think this session was just fantastic. but for anyone who wants to follow you more, you, I mean, I don't know how you do it all, but so you're you obviously, you run Jesse on a journey You also have travel blog prosperity and a podcast for travel bloggers that really helps them. And then you, are kindly giving away a 4 day e course that people can watch sort of help, you explain it better than I do, but help them with their blog. But I think you kinda mentioned it's like a blog makeover. Right.

Jessie Festa [00:32:56]:
So -- Yeah. And it's basically four short videos. I realize people have, you know, not a lot of time. So four just kinda like fluff free actionable videos that will take you step by step from the branding to the monetization aspect. So in the most succinct way possible, basically.

Liz Stapleton [00:33:13]:
Yeah.
