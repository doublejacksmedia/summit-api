Hi, guys.

[00:00:11.460] - Tracy Lynn, bloggingonpoint.com
Hey!

[00:00:12.040] - Caroline
Hello, hello and welcome to our presentation of Plant Your Flag. I am Caroline Vencil.

[00:00:19.210] - Tracy
And I am Tracy Lynne.

[00:00:20.950] - Caroline
And together we make up the blogging mentorship group Blogging on Point. And we are super, super passionate about helping amazing people who want to make more money from their blogs and from their online businesses. So, we're super excited to share this presentation with you guys today because planting your flag was the thing that for Tracy and I was was really the game changer of of moving our businesses forward and being able to have fun with it, because that's our big thing, is having fun.

[00:00:49.840] - Tracy
Always have fun.

[00:00:51.370] - Caroline
All right. So today you are going to get ready for some homework because that's what we do. We don't believe in just kind of throwing information at you. You need to make it actionable. So, get ready with a notepad and a pen. You're going to absolutely love taking some some little mini homework assignments. And we're going to help you attract your perfect people, repel the rest and create an email list of super fans. So, let's get started. Okay, our goal for this presentation, we want you to be able to find your flag in your niche, plant it and call your people to it; that's our goal here, guys. What is this presentation without us sharing our flag with you guys that you understand, like, what is this flag that you are talking about? So, here's our flag. We're going to be totally honest. We've already explained that we are brutally honest and real with you guys. We are all in this to make money. This is not a hobby. It is a business. And it is okay to say it. Making money from your business is not wrong. It's not immoral. It's not shady. There's nothing wrong with it at all. That's what we believe now.

[00:02:04.990] - Tracy
I want to say something because that's super, super important that you make that mind- mind shift from a blogger to online business owner. And once you do that, it takes the shady out of it, don't you think? It makes it more- it's a big business. This is what I do. There's nothing wrong with making money with my business.

[00:02:25.000] - Caroline
Yes.

[00:02:25.450] - Tracy
So, that's an important point to make as well.

[00:02:27.580] - Caroline
Absolutely. And we hope that you understand that this isn't we're not going to be dealing in snake oil sales here. We're not going to be saying anything that's going to be icky or used car sales-many. These are all things that are going to help you feel connected with your business and with your readers.

[00:02:44.770] - Tracy
Absolutely.

[00:02:47.400] - Caroline
So, let's dive right in with limiting beliefs, because once we say things like we believe that you should be able to make money from your blog, from your business, all of these negative things come up in our minds. I don't know about you, but for both of us, it was a lot of like, "Oh, no, that can't be right." "It's icky." "It's gross. "The only way to make money for my blog is going to be with ads." "I would never sell anything. Email is just never worked for me.' "I have a lot of people on my list, but I guess I suck at selling because nobody ever buys for me."

[00:03:25.190] - Tracy
Don't you think that is the most common thing, though, is people don't buy. So, if they don't buy the first time, we tell ourselves they're never going to buy.

[00:03:35.280] - Caroline
"I must be doing something wrong." "I must suck at what I'm doing because nobody bought from me then and then you never sell again." Right? Like you've been burned the first time you've ever tried to sell something and then you never do it again. That's not all we want to have happen. Those are all limiting beliefs that we have. I know that you're probably also saying, "I've already heard it all before." "I know emails important, but I guess it's still not working because nobody's buying from me." Or, "I have people on my list, but nobody opens it." Or my ultimate favorite limiting belief that I have said this to myself, "I can't sell." "I can't sell."

[00:04:14.940] - Tracy
I think we've all said that to ourselves, though.

[00:04:17.540] - Caroline
Right?

[00:04:18.390] - Tracy
Yes.

[00:04:18.510] - Caroline
And it's just a limiting belief, guys. So, yeah, we want to break that out, because the truth is, you're already selling to your list. You're already selling to your people without ever realizing it because what you're selling is you.

[00:04:35.820] - Tracy
I think that right there is a game changer. When I heard that, you know what you're already selling, you're selling yourself, I'm like, "Oh, my gosh, that's exactly right." And when you hear those words, it changes everything. It takes from hard to I'm already doing this.

[00:04:53.040] - Caroline
Yeah.

[00:04:53.520] - Tracy
I'm already doing this every single day in my blog post, in my newsletters and my social media post. I'm already doing this.

[00:05:00.360] - Caroline
Yeah, because here's the thing, though. It's not just enough to say, like I'm subscribed to Tracey Lynn, I'm subscribed to Carolyn Vencil. Are you being real with your people? Are you actually showing up as you- not Miss Pinterest perfect. Not the Step third wives version. Not the watered down version where you're afraid to say things like, I don't know. Stinky, stinky face, not the one- not the version of yourself where you're trying to be someone that you're not.

[00:05:37.220] - Tracy
Right. Not following someone else's voice or their stance or their journey, that is a unique thing.

[00:05:44.050] - Caroline
Yeah.

[00:05:44.720] - Tracy
You need to what we like to call "plant your flag", find your voice, and don't just find your voice. You need to own it.

[00:05:54.030] - Caroline
Yep. Full, full on. We want you to stop the self-doubt of yourself, you are enough. You are enough. Your people need to and want to hear from you authentically and you need to in your job description. It needs to say, and I show up for my people, I am there for them. I am me to my people. That's what you need to be able to do.

[00:06:24.800] - Tracy
Absolutely.

[00:06:27.650] - Caroline
But wait, why is it so important to find your flag? Why is this so important? Isn't it enough to just write out an email and send it out to people or announce the sale and just send it out to your people? No, it's not enough. We have been there. We've done it. We have messed it up ethically. And you know what? It really doesn't work.

[00:06:51.350] - Tracy
Oh, it's so doesn't work. And that's one of the reasons why we're here today, is to get you unstuck and back on the right track because. Yeah, it's no fun being stuck. We know.

[00:07:03.120] - Caroline
No, absolutely. We have been there. We have struggled through it. And we want to help you out and understanding that honestly, planting your flag, staking your claim is going to be the game changer for you inside of your market and for your business.

[00:07:17.060] - Tracy
Amen.

[00:07:19.440] - Caroline
So, hi again, so that we get to know each other even better. We are Tracy and Caroline, I volunteer as tribute first all the time.

[00:07:27.240] - Tracy
All the time.

[00:07:28.440] - Caroline
Hi, guys. I'm Caroline. I am the owner of Caroline Vencil.com. I am a mom of four. I have three sons and one little baby girl. I am the wife of an amazing, hard working husband. I have been a full time blogger for more than five years now, which is crazy town to me. I full time lover of coffee kitty cuddles and making money while I sleep. I love that. I know. Right. So, here is the back story of this struggle. You seen like I lead with the fact that I'm very successful in my business. I'm very thankful for it, but nobody ever talks about like the origin story. So, I started my blog back in 2015 and I genuinely expected to make twenty thousand dollars. In my first month blogging, I published that Hello World post and crickets. I'm sitting there refreshing the page over and over and over again and I was genuinely shocked that it didn't happen. And then after it didn't happen, I was like, "Oh, I will just do what all of these other big bloggers are doing, because if it works for them, it must work for me. And that was when I started faking my voice and I lost it. I lost who I was. I got rid of who I genuinely was at my core, which is a total spaz and a weirdo. Can you tell this is really me? If I was trying to be like, "Good morning everyone. Hello and welcome to our webinar. This is a joyous occasion." You'd be like, "Oh, that's weird." I couldn't do that forever. So, I wound up growing my list with all the wrong people because I did try to do the whole Pinterest-perfect-mom thing for way too long. And in that process of growing my list with all the wrong people, I finally found my voice. I finally found my voice and I got the okay to let my freak flag fly. And then I started to bring in the right people and that's when I planted my flag loudly. I'm allowed human. Just true story.

[00:09:20.760] - Tracy
I love that. Okay, my name is Tracy Lynn and I'm the owner of Simple Living Country Gal.com. Mom of four. GG of two. Adorable little boys, if I do say so myself.

[00:09:31.950] - Caroline
They are.

[00:09:31.950] - Tracy
I'm a full time blogger and I also love Coffee Grandbaby's. I'm kind of addicted to go shows. Yeah, I kind of make money talking about goats, which is fun and in a unique niche to have. So, here's my back story. I started blogging a year after Caroline in 2016 and I got on the chasing pages for the fast income train.

[00:09:58.010] - Caroline
Chu-chu

[00:09:58.380] - Tracy
Oh I know, right. But unfortunately those page views left and that left me standing there trying to find a different way to make money. That's when I turn to email and I got to work attracting my perfect person. Like Caroline, I found my voice because I was copying people in the beginning, too. I think that's something everybody does in the beginning because we need that permission to be our own person. So, I was emulating other people I admired in my niche and I was sounding like them, but I found my voice and that's when I started shouting it from the blogging rooftops. And then something crazy magical happened. My list went from stagnant and nonresponsive to the backbone of my business. My readers started answering questions. They started emailing me. And they started buying from me. And that means I am now in charge of my income and I'm not at the mercy of page views anymore.

[00:10:57.810] - Caroline
And can I get an amen for that?

[00:10:57.810] - Tracy
Okay, so before you plant your flag, you need to know what your flag actually is.

[00:11:09.750] - Caroline
100%. This is our favorite quote, guys. When we heard this quote the first time both of us sat there and were like, "My mind is blown." Love me or hate me, there's no money in the middle. And both of us- so, true story- both of us are people pleasers to an extent. We really are. We've had conversations before. We're we're like, "Oh, what do you think?" Oh, I don't know. What do you think? Back and forth and back and forth all the time. But at the end of the day, that's not how business needs to be. You need to take a stand, because when you have people who are following you, who understand what you have to say, who are like, "Yes, that is my girl, she gets me. She's in my head." I feel like you've known me my whole life. "How did you know that's exactly what I was thinking?" And then you're going to have people who are like, "No, they read the first line of your first email and your first welcome sequence and they are like "I am out of here." The truth is, once you find that- once you find the ability to convey how you feel accurately, perfectly, that's what will bring in your perfect person.

[00:12:21.660] - Tracy
I love that you're "perfect person"- the exact person you want on your email list. Okay, so let's talk about this. We have a process.

[00:12:32.760] - Caroline
We do.

[00:12:33.690] - Tracy
Yes. This is our perfect person process. So, go for it Carolyn.

[00:12:39.600] - Caroline
Okay, so, here is how this is all going to work, because I know that you're probably sitting there like, "It's fine and dandy, but it's just still not going to work for me." But we've got you because once you find your voice, once you're able to really hone it in and nail that down and figure out exactly what you stand for, then it will come through in your awesome content. And your perfect person is out there and will be like magnetized to it and will find it and will be like, "Yes girl! I knew it. I knew there was someone out there who knew what I was thinking. " They're going to join your email list because you're still speaking to them in a language that they understand and that no one else has spoken to them in that same way. You're going to be talking to them on your email list exactly the way that they need to hear it, touching on the pain points that they're like, "I didn't think that anybody knew what I was feeling, what I was thinking, my pains I was having." Then that is how you are going to turn them into your raving fans because you built the content that has drawn them in. They were magnetized to you immediately. In your email, they've become polarized and magnetized to you. Now they're like, "Yes, yes, yes, yes. 300%, you are in my head. We're besties. I will throw all of my money at you in the best way possible."

[00:13:52.590] - Caroline
And that's why it's so important that you be your own person and you don't fake it by trying to be someone else. When you're faking it, you're not able to write the exact content that your readers need to read. And you're not able to emulate that voice throughout every single email you send every week. And when you don't be your own person, you're- you're pulling in the wrong people. And when you pull in the wrong people, you have to do a lot of backtracking.

[00:12:21.660] - Tracy
So, our goal today is to help you find your voice right now so you can start bringing in the perfect person right now, so you don't have to go back and fix things from earlier on.

[00:14:29.740] - Caroline
Yeah.

[00:14:31.740] - Tracy
So, let's talk about finding your perfect person. So, if you feel like you were talking to everyone and you don't want to step on people's toes or annoy anyone, then don't skip this. Like Caroline said, we were people pleasers and we've since changed that. The magic happens when you just focus on your story and your message and your niche. Don't worry about how that message is going to be taken by people, because, like we said, love me or hate me, there's no money in the middle. So, you want to plant your flag and decide where you're going to stand. So, the right person people are attracted to you from the beginning?

[00:15:10.620] - Caroline
Yep.

[00:15:12.400] - Tracy
Okay, sorry.

[00:15:15.460] - Caroline
So, your homework is you are going to find your polarizing passion statements. Now I know that that's a big, scary word, right? It doesn't have to be all that this means as you're going to list out three to five things that you feel strongly about in your niche. The goal here is to- it is to get into- is to get your head in the right place to attract your real perfect person to your blog, to your email list, to your Instagram, to your YouTube, to wherever your Internet circle is. You have to figure out three to five things that you feel strongly about in your niche. Now, that doesn't have to be mean. It doesn't have to be nasty. It doesn't have to be anything that is like throwing mud at the other side, unless that's what you really want to do. For me, we're going to list some of our examples. So, I'm in the personal finance space and I feel like everybody in the entire world has an opinion on Dave Ramsey. Right. So, in personal finance, it's just easy to use Dave Ramsey is kind of this lightning rod; either you love him or you hate him. It's either one or the two camps, and there's really not a whole lot of middle ground. So, that's in my world. I would say I blank with Dave Ramsey. I agree with Dave Ramsey. I think he's completely wrong. That would be a polarizing passion statement, because if you're like, "I love me some Dave Ramsey." And I said, "I disagree with everything the man says", you would be like, "All right, peace out. That's fine. We're done here." It's immediately when you read a sentence like that, you know, if I am- if you are my person or you're not my person, without me ever having to say, "If you don't agree with that, you can just leave." Do you know what I mean?

[00:17:03.760] - Tracy
No, and I think that's important to say on my niche, it's done just a little bit differently because I blog about urban homesteading, which means how to grow a garden if you live in a city, how to have chickens, if you live in the suburbs. And that means anybody that's a self-sufficient bug out homesteader that lives off grid is not going to be attracted to me. So, my flag is the urban homesteader. And that tells people that aren't into that type of homesteading that this is not the place for them. So, when we say "plant your flag", it doesn't have to be- I don't know, it doesn't have to be super direct or yes/no or things like that. It just has to make sure that you're attracting the right people with that flag. You're like, "Hey, if you live in the suburbs and you don't think you can live self sufficiently, I got you. Come over here. I'm your person. I'm the one that you want to read about."

[00:17:56.260] - Caroline
Yeah.

[00:17:56.390] - Tracy
So there's different ways to do it. And we just want to encourage you to find the best way to plant your flag, decide what your flag is, and then own it all the way through.

[00:18:05.680] - Caroline
Yeah. And the big thing for it is there's no people pleasing allowed here. You can't say- I'm going to keep using my example because Tracy is going to make fun of me all the time. I know nothing at all about farm animals that I'm not going to embarrass myself; maybe a little bit later. I'll embarrass later. Don't worry,

[00:18:21.640] - Tracy
Okay.

[00:18:21.990] - Caroline
In my world, we're going to keep using Dave Ramsey. It would be the equivalent of me saying, "I guess everybody could do what Dave Ramsey says or not whatever. It's not a big deal." Are you going to tell somebody that you are like in love with this person who is a blogger on the Internet and you're like, "They have no opinion on the most polarizing figure in the personal finance world." They have no opinion on this? No. You're going to be like, "Oh, my gosh, this other person absolutely loves this big blogger that I follow." It has to be something that you're passionate about without diving into people pleasing. So, remember, you're allowed to take a stand because you will bring the right people to you.

[00:19:06.280] - Tracy
That's the ultimate goal. Absolutely. Okay. So, step number two is to make your perfect freebie. This is my favorite thing ever, because now that you know who it is you were talking to that person that has- that is coming to your flag, it's now going to be so much easier to figure out what it is they  need to bring them onto your email list.

[00:19:29.770] - Caroline
Yes.

[00:19:30.100] - Tracy
Because as you start honing in on every aspect of the flag planting process, you are going to make everything easier. So, if you ever struggled with coming up with a freebie, guess what? It's not going to be that scary anymore because you're in the right mindset. You're not faking it. It's exactly who you are and what you believe in. So, now you know the tools that you would need as a brand new person in your niche to get started doing it is- doing whatever it is that you're teaching.

[00:19:59.590] - Caroline
Yep.

[00:20:00.760] - Tracy
Okay, so for your homework, for step number two is you want to make a list of your readers pain points. Now, this is something that Caroline taught me that changed everything for me. Here's the thing, guys, if you know the exact pain points that your readers are having, then you can make a solution so much easier than what you're trying to do now. So, the solution is going to solve a pain point, and that solution is your freebie. And when you offer that freebie, that perfect person is going to read your content and say, Okay, "This is exactly what I need." Then they're going to see your freebie. And you're like, "Oh my gosh, this is exactly what I have to have." And the process just flows all the way through. Okay, so Caroline, would you like to talk about different pain points in how to do that for our homework?

[00:20:50.900] - Caroline
I absolutely would, because I absolutely love talking about pain points.

[00:20:53.450] - Tracy
You do that's why I'm asking.

[00:20:54.320] - Caroline
This is you- guys, this is like one of the big things that gets so overlooked is once you figure out your ideal person, you can hone in on their pain points, just like Tracey said, so much easier because you know them. So, I encourage you to do a complete brain dump. And what that means is you're literally sitting there pop in some earbuds, turn on like classical music or something, tone out the rest of the world and just fill up a page with all of the things that your ideal perfect person would be saying to themselves, would be struggling with. What are the words that they would use? What are they thinking about themselves? What are the limiting beliefs that they have? What do they want? What are their problems? And then all of this information fill up as much as you can.

[00:21:44.150] - Tracy
And if it makes it- I'm sorry, if it makes it easier, you can use prompts. So, talking. The first person of your reader, I wish, I struggle with, I hate, I need, I want. And just fill in as many answers for each of those prompts as you can do. And let me just say it was hard for me in the beginning when Caroline had me start doing this, but when you start, it's like the dam breaks open and all of these ideas come. So, when I first- when I did this for the first time, I'd like four things on there.

[00:22:14.900] - Caroline
Oh, yeah.

[00:22:15.170] - Tracy
And then after I did it a couple of times, it's like a page and a half.

[00:22:19.340] - Caroline
And the first four, it's like pulling teeth.

[00:22:21.860] - Tracy
Yeah.

[00:22:22.060] - Caroline
You're like, "I don't know, I guess that they struggle with this, but I don't know what else." And then once you start digging deeper and you force yourself to sit there for like 10, 15 minutes just writing about your person and what the struggles are, you will find that it becomes so much easier to get all that information out, because once you have that, then you can come back to this list and revisit it so that you can narrow down what kinds of a freebie can you offer to help them with that problem. Now, we're talking like a freebie here, guys. We're not getting into a product yet. We're not even going to go there. So, we're not telling you to make an entire course of like eight hundred different pages. We're talking like a checklist.

[00:23:04.580] - Tracy
Write a checklist.

[00:23:04.580] - Caroline
Yeah, a checklist, a day planner, a guide that they can do.

[00:23:10.400] - Tracy
A worksheet, a cheat sheet . Just one page is all you need to change someone's life forever. Forever. So, don't overthink it. Do your pain points, come up with solutions and just make a one page simple item that will help your readers.

[00:23:27.050] - Caroline
Yep. And then you're going to pick that one pain point that you can do. Just one. We're not trying to solve world hunger here. You're picking one pain point to give them a solution to in your freebie.

[00:23:38.660] - Tracy
Love it. Okay, so what's next?

[00:23:42.440] - Caroline
We're going to craft your perfect email.

[00:23:44.270] - Tracy
Yes. And by this point, guys, since you've already done step one and step two, step three should be a lot easier because you're- you're in that mindset now. You're in the zone.

[00:23:55.130] - Caroline
Yes.

[00:23:55.340] - Tracy
So now that you know your people, you know their pain point, you know their inner voice, you're on the same wavelength with them. You can speak a language that they will actually resonate with. This will build the connection you need to turn that casual reader into your perfect person.

[00:23:42.440] - Caroline
Yeah. And the goal is you literally want to be inside of their heads. And you've already done that work with saying what you feel about your needs and about your topic. You figure it out their pain points, and now you're going to make your perfect emails because it's going to be a lot easier to talk to people once you understand that; you don't have to put on ears to be liked. You already know who it is that you want to bring in. You already know how to talk to them and you know how to speak to them about their problems in a way that is going to click with them.

[00:24:44.090] - Tracy
Absolutely.

[00:24:48.450] - Caroline
We're going to solve your readers problems by being you. Easy peasy, tada. And that sounds a lot more trivialized than it really is, because I understand that you're like "I don't understand what that means." What that literally means is you're going to look at one of your readers- I think we have to go to the next slide.

[00:24:44.090] - Tracy
Oh, I'm sorry.

[00:25:08.740] - Caroline
Back, Okay- maybe- no- wait. No, this is fine. So, you need to let them know what you stand for inside of your e-mails by the words that you're using, by the way, that you're talking, by the way, that you are connecting with them and saying, look, "I know that you struggle with X. I have struggled with X, too, but here's how I've overcome it. Here's the things that I've done." And you're going to be writing these emails in a way that's just going to be easy. It's not going to have to sound robotic. You don't have to put on ears or sound like, you know, Martha Stewart or look like Martha Stewart, for all I care. You are going to be real with them inside of these emails because, again, you have the full permission to be you.

[00:25:54.130] - Tracy
Yeah. And this is your chance to be conversational. So, you know on our blog post. We're kind of more teacher role. We're kind of more serious in that. Your email, it's game over. You can do and be the exact person and you can give it to them full board. This is still another place where you're planting your flag, because let's look at it this way. When you write your blog post, you're planting a flag. When you're doing your freebie, you're planting just a little bit bigger flag. And when you get them on your email list, then you're put the big flag on there. You're putting it all you right there on the line. This is their last chance to stay or scoot. Good news if they stay, that's your person. Yeah, that is your person.

[00:26:38.200] - Caroline
It's really true. So the goal is you have to let them know every single step of this journey- you have to let them know that they are in the right place. And if you went from being super conversational in a post to being like a college professor with MLA citations in your emails, they're going to be like, "What happened here?" "Who is this person?" "I connected with this person in this post. I don't know who is emailing me."

[00:27:02.590] - Tracy
Right.

[00:27:02.950] - Caroline
And then they'll unsubscribe. We don't want that to happen. You want to continue to be yourself, because the way that you're going to connect with your people is by letting them know that they are in the right place every step of the way.

[00:27:14.770] - Tracy
Okay, with that being said, you don't want to be a jerk.

[00:27:19.870] - Caroline
No, no. You need to give them help. You can't just send them. "You know what I found out that was really annoying today." Nobody needs to hear all of that email. You want to still address a problem that they're having inside of the emails because you know, their pain points. You can touch on them every single time, even if it's something as trivial as like "I did something this week and I thought about you because I encountered a pain point that you probably have that I had to. And here's how I solved it." And I'm infusing my personality. I'm sharing stories about my life. I'm allowing you to understand, like I'm a real person, like we're building this connection the entire time.

[00:27:58.720] - Tracy
And I think that's super important to touch on.

[00:28:02.110] - Caroline
Oh yeah.

[00:28:02.470] - Tracy
That is their chance to resonate with you.

[00:28:05.440] - Caroline
Yep.

[00:28:05.680] - Tracy
If you share something that happens in your day, then it helps them make that connection. And when you're not faking it, you can share things in your day without thinking, "All right, how am I going to color this, so, it matches my voice." You don't have to worry about that. It's just natural conversation in an email that helps your reader resonate with you even more. So, that is huge that you know your thing.

[00:28:26.320] - Caroline
Yes, it's true. However, we do want to point out that when we talk about polarizing things, it's easy. And Tracy, I had to walk Tracy through this, too. When I say polarizing, she automatically thought being a jerk.

[00:28:40.840] - Tracy
Yes.

[00:28:41.490] - Caroline
It's so easy to think like, well, I could just bash everybody. No, no, no, no, no. You can be honest and be fully you with out bashing other people, without slinging mud or without being mean. You can be passionate. You cannot be mean unless that's really what you want to do. But I feel like we've cov-

[00:29:00.700] - Tracy
So, basically what you're saying is and I know I'm asking a question in our own side show, but basically what you're saying is it's okay+ to be positive about the stance that you're taking without throwing anybody else under the bus.

[00:29:12.940] - Caroline
Yeah.

[00:29:13.660] - Tracy
Perfect.

[00:29:14.260] - Caroline
You can say, like, I'm going to keep mu- I mean, I guess- I- let me use- let's use goats, for example, because Caroline knows nothing about goats, but okay. So, you could say, you know, like there's two different camps of you need to have 150 acres if you ever want to have goats or there's people who say, "I keep them in my postage stamp backyard because it's like- it's like a dog." If you come in and say, "I think anybody who doesn't have over 100 acres for their animals is mean and terrible and should be reported to the the authorities." If you came in and said that, that would be like, whoa, attacking. You don't need to say that. You can take your stance. Be passionate about what you have to say without being mean. So, that's all we want to kind of get to through you guys is not- we're not saying under any circumstances to be a jerk, be passionate, plant your flag and you don't have to throw anybody under the bus in that process.

[00:30:10.380] - Tracy
I love that, okay, maybe some of you still need a little more permission. Guess what? This is your permission to fully be yourself and plant your flag.

[00:30:22.590] - Caroline
Take a picture of the page if you want. We'll even smile for you here. Ready? Screenshot! Please post that on Instagram and tag us, we're @bloggingonpoint on Instagram. I would love to see that all over Instagram. That would just make my day.

[00:30:39.860] - Tracy
That would be awesome.

[00:30:41.110] - Caroline
This is the thing, guys: When we were first starting, we felt like we weren't good enough. We felt like we didn't have enough to say. Like, who were we to have an opinion? How dare we?

[00:30:54.400] - Tracy
Who am I to talk about this?

[00:30:56.280] - Caroline
Yes. And we felt inferior and like we weren't good enough. And it almost- it almost cost us our blogs. I feel like it's pretty safe to say like this, if that had continued, I would have quit because it's so hard to continue to try to be something that you're not.

[00:31:12.220] - Tracy
It's exhausting.

[00:31:12.960] - Caroline
This is your permission to be yourself, to fully be yourself, to show up as you authentically to say what you have to say authentically, to voice your opinion and your authority in your niche. You have authority, by the way, just in case you feel like you don't you have authority, you know what you're talking about, otherwise you wouldn't be there. This is an important part for you guys to understand, is you can fully be yourself and still have a huge following on the Internet.

[00:31:49.990] - Tracy
Absolutely.

[00:31:52.160] - Caroline
They're little healthy dose of of rah rah motivation.

[00:31:57.920] - Tracy
Motivational speak on planting your flag by Tracy and Caroline. 

[00:32:04.050] - Caroline
Tada!

[00:32:04.580] - Tracy
Okay, so let's talk about planting your flag because let's be honest, the online world is crowded and you really need to find your corner to take your stand and to preach it from the rooftops so that your perfect people can find you.

[00:32:19.350] - Caroline
Yeah, because if you're not taking a stand, think about it. People don't- I tried to convey this earlier and I totally botched it. But think about it. People don't share their favorite blogger unless they have a stand. I'm not going to share about somebody who I can't remember how they feel about something. If you didn't take any kind of a stand, it's not memorable. It's not like there's something that clicks there. It just becomes noise. Do you know what I mean? Like the world of the Internet is full of so many people. If you're going to want to stand out like we do for our businesses, for our brands, for our blogs, we have to stand out. It's our responsibility to stand out to help our people who are out there thinking that nobody gets them. There's people out there right now looking for somebody who has your voice, who has your story, who has your stance on everything that they're thinking. And they're out there right now thinking, "Nobody gets me."

[00:33:22.880] - Tracy
Yeah, nobody gets me. Use that flag to bring them in, waving it as hard as you can to get them to see you, to get them to hear you, to get them in your corner so that they can find you.

[00:33:35.390] - Caroline
Yep.

[00:33:36.260] - Tracy
Absolutely.

[00:33:40.290] - Caroline
Do I read it? Do you want to read it?

[00:33:43.680] - Tracy
Go for it. There's a lot of words on this page. You read.

[00:33:45.480] - Caroline
Okay, when you plant your flag, this is how you know that you have hit the planting your flag gold- that you have struck gold on exactly what it is that you are trying to convey in your messaging. You are going to be calling in the right people and you're going to clear out anybody from your world, from your email list who is there for the wrong reason, a.k.a. not your perfect people. You will begin to be able to celebrate your unsubscribes. I know that you guys have heard that for like forever- to celebrate the unsubscribes. You're like, "But it still hurts." Here's the thing: When you plant your flag and are able to be fully, authentically you and every single thing that you ever create, you will know that the people who are leaving are not your people and that they are going to make room for the right people on your list.

[00:34:39.570] - Tracy
And that's a game changer when you look at it that way you guys.

[00:34:42.430] - Caroline
I know right?

[00:34:42.540] - Tracy
I mean, I had a hard time with my first couple of unsubscribes. You know what? It's a mindset shift that you need to make. So, don't focus on who's leaving. Focus on who's staying, because those are your people. Those are the people that you're going to turn your blog into an online business with and for. And that is so important for you guys to keep that focus front and center at all times, let everybody else go. You keep your attention where it matters with your perfect person.

[00:35:13.740] - Caroline
Yep. And that way you will be able to explode your list with exactly who you want to talk to, a.k.a. your perfect people.

[00:35:25.530] - Tracy
Absolutely. Absolutely. And we both believe beyond a shadow of a doubt, that you 100% can do it.

[00:35:35.420] - Caroline
Without a question, without a question. Now, we know that it's going to be hard in the beginning. We understand that it's going to be something for you to get over of. Like "I'm allowed to say my opinion." Of course you are. And it's going to take some time. And yes, when you first start being able to be authentically you, you are going to see more people leaving your space. But at the same time, you're going to see more people coming in who agree with you. You're going to get more comments, more replies, more likes, more follows from the right people who are like, "Yes, I thought that I was the only person who thought that. You were going to find your people very, very quickly and know that without a shadow of a doubt that they are there for you, not because they accidentally stumbled across your blog, not because you had the best, shiniest, most, prettiest, most giving everything away a freebie out there. And that was all that they wanted. Another on your list and you're like, "Oh, crap, how'd I get here?" You know that you're going to have the right people. We know that you can do it without a question.

[00:36:40.130] - Tracy
Without a question. Okay, so Caroline and I love to give marching orders. And basically what that means is a list of actionable items that you can do to take what we taught you and put it into action, because we're not- we're not about theory. I mean, that's a good thing. But we're not about theory. We're about taking action and implementing the things that we learn. So, we have marching orders for you.

[00:36:40.130] - Caroline
We do. And you can get that as the PDF download if you go to Bloggingonpoint.com/BBS, and we have it for you and it's free. And it's basically this presentation with a few extra little fun things on there for you guys, because there's- there's no reason for you guys to hear more information if you're not going to take action. And so that's what we wanted to give you are some actual action items for you to take from today going forward.

[00:37:33.710] - Caroline
And we cannot wait to see how your business changes and grows and how much more you love being able to do what you do. And don't forget, take us on Instagram.

[00:37:41.870] - Caroline
If you took a screenshot of us being weird, by the way, like it's @Bloggingonpoint, here's a picture of us being all right, guys, that we believe in you and have a great rest of your day.

[00:37:53.630] - Tracy
You got this bye.

[00:37:55.220] - Caroline
Bye.
