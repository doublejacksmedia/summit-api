Transcript:
[00:00:13.190] - Interviewer
Hi, guys. I'm so excited to have this speaker back. She was part of the very first Blogger Breakthrough summit back in 2020. I fangirled her real hard during her session. I'm going to try to keep it in check today. She is the host of the Inbox Besties Podcast and also the creator of the Love Your List Course, which in my opinion, basically teaches you all the things - email marketing. She's just super awesome in general. A big, warm welcome to Kate Doster. Thank you, Kate, so much for being here.

[00:00:38.930] - Kate
Well, thank you so much for having me. I am super stoked to be part of the summit again. It is one of my favorites. I really love how well it is structured with your tracks that you have. I think that helps so much when coming to such a big summit.

[00:00:51.770] - Interviewer
Yes, don't try to watch all of them, guys. It'll be too much. Okay.

[00:00:58.070] - Kate
That's why the Pro Pass is so great, because then you're just watching your leisure.

[00:01:01.490] - Interviewer
Yes, yes,  All Access Pass or Pro Pass, either one. So I kind of want to dive in because we have a session on list building, and I think a lot of people can find tons of tutorials on setting up your email list and your forums and un-nurture sequence, right?

[00:01:17.270] - Interviewer
Like, everyone got that basic stuff. Once you have your nurture sequence, what's next? What do you do, like? Okay, you've got these people, they're nurtured and you email them. But really, how do you make it into a plan that's going to help your business?

[00:01:32.270] - Kate
I absolutely love that question. I think that you are correct. Well, having people to talk to is important, so definitely make sure you watch that session. I think having an action plan for what to do with them after that nurture sequence or after that welcome sequence. It's really where the true fun stuff begins. I think most people would say, oh, that's where the work begins. No, this is where the fun stuff is, so you can take two approaches. You can be sending emails live every single week. That's a traditional newsletter/broadcast, and I always recommend that people to do that once a week. It's okay if you miss a week.

[00:02:02.870] - Kate
It happens to the best of us. Just get back on the horse. It's four emails that you're going to be sending out. When you send them out in real-time, that means if you sign your email out and say the 13th, if somebody had signed up on the 15th, they're never going to be able to read it. If you wanted to, and this is definitely more advanced. And I would only suggest it to people who have all of their digital products down, know their niche, have their messaging if they want to switch to more of an autoresponder type of a thing.

[00:02:30.590] - Kate
So essentially, you're taking that nurture sequence and you're putting it on steroids where you are sending everybody through the first set of welcome emails, and then you're sending them through either sales nurture sequence or do this sequence or based on this click search sequence. But most people, especially when they're in the intermediate area, this is where we're really starting to thrive into what we want to be known for, the products that we want to have, the people that we want to help. So really, it is getting our sea legs. So you don't need to think too far out.

[00:02:57.950] - Kate
No, you don't just start with real time first when it comes to helping out your people. 

[00:03:04.550] - Interviewer
Okay, and then kind of what... At what point would you expand that nurture sequence? So I think a lot of people start out with simple three to five, which is chill and great and works. Is there a point that you would want that to be longer before you start doing live stuff or sales sequences?

[00:03:25.250] - Kate
I would say that it just depends on you. I think that a lot of people are like, what? That's your answer to that. If you are the type of person that is going to be consistent and email every week, then you can stand to have a shorter nurture sequence. What I do want you to have set up at least twice a year. It can be once a quarter if your business is going through big pivots and you're making big changes is to go back and look at that nurture sequence, because you might have some digital products.

[00:03:51.470] - Kate
Now from going through this summit, you might have a signature program at this point, but you're not talking about it in your old nurture sequence. Or maybe you're really into productivity when you started, but you've actually sort of pushed away. And now you're just somebody who wants to talk about, say, [inaudible 00:04:05]  if you're in the [inaudible 00:04:07]  space. So you need to make sure, like, is this up to my writing quality now six months later, right? Because if you're not embarrassed by your past work, you're not growing and you're not maturing.

[00:04:16.850] - Kate
So be embarrassed by everything. That's the best thing, but you got the right stuff to be embarrassed about. And then again, is this nurture sequence actually supporting my goals? So you might have a nurture sequence. You might be a little bit more advanced and have an actual sales funnel, which we can talk about the difference between those two if you want to and you might want to in your nurture sequence, say that you've got some type of kick-off event for your sales funnel.

[00:04:43.670] - Kate
So sales funnel is traditionally at the end of it and throughout it, you're usually selling something that's higher-priced, that's kind of the funnel part. Sometimes people have a webinar, some people will have a free challenge that they're running, but it's something that you can kind of have on evergreen, so you might have a free, that's just sort of a one-off PDF or a cheat sheet or say, audio that you've got that you're giving out to people. So in a nurture sequence, you probably want to tell them, I call it like a launch trigger or sales trigger about that sales trigger that you now have.

[00:05:13.490] - Kate
Now they can go through the funnel. So that way you're kind of helping people from every angle. So you said a sales funnel is very, very focused on selling one product. It usually is higher priced. You don't need to have an eleven-part sales series for a $27 offer. That is cutting butter with the chainsaw. It is overkill. Like, yes, you can do that. But people do not need eleven emails in a row about that. Usually, they would need those 9, 10. I guess it depends. It could be a lot less than that about that one product and about not only that one product, but it's about how you can help them.

[00:05:51.230] - Kate
It's about helping them figure out, like, hey, it's okay if you've tried this before and it didn't work. Here's why it didn't work. And here's why this thing is going to work for you now. Here's why it's different. Here's why I believe in you. Here's how I can help you. Here are some other people have done it, those sorts of things. 

[00:06:09.050] - Interviewer
Yeah, because I think, isn't it like people need to see or hear about procurement at least seven times or something before they'll buy like that's some statistic.

[00:06:17.990] - Interviewer
I swear, I'm not making it up.

[00:06:19.560] - Kate
You are not.

[00:06:23.030] 
What? 

[00:06:24.110] - Kate
I said you're not.

[00:06:25.070] - Interviewer
Yeah, I didn't think so. Sales funnel is much more focused in terms of selling products, whereas nurture sequence is really more like giving them help and showing them how awesome you are and making sure they're your people because I know your people.

[00:06:43.010] - Kate
 Exactly. It's a little bit more of, like, I like to think of a sales funnel. And this is my metaphor, because when my brain works like a sales funnel is to say, like, you're having a party. You want everyone to play Dance Dance Revolution, like, back in the day. So you need to think of, like, every reason why, Samantha, you say your ideal person, whatever you want to name them, right? Why wouldn't you want to get on the dance floor is because she thinks she has no rhythm.

[00:07:06.350] - Kate
So how can you prove to her that rhythm doesn't matter? Is it because she's embarrassed? Is it because she'd want a partner? Is it because she doesn't know what song it is? Is it because there's a room of strangers? So you're basically trying to do everything you can to be like, is this really a good fit for her? And what can you do to make her feel more confident about either of her decisions? Because, again, it's always up to them. And that's the thing about sales.

[00:07:27.950] - Kate
I'm not coercing you. It's just like, look, this is it if you're this type of person, right? Whereas the welcome series is coming. Oh, yeah. Here's Dance Dance Revolution. Here's the chip. Here's the bathroom. So you can sprinkle in some lower price offers. You can have two emails about an e-book that you have. Go ahead. You can talk about how you got interviewed on an amazing summit. You can go ahead and talk about your podcast, your Instagram, those sorts of things. So that way, again, it's all about keeping them into your world.

[00:07:58.010] - Interviewer
Yes. No, I do like that. They don't need to be the people that take towels to the Dance Dance Revolution machine at the arcade. I used to work at an arcade, so I have very different numbers Dance Dance revolutions when I was in high school and network.

[00:08:16.410] - Kate
Hold onto the bar and the beater going, oh, my God.

[00:08:19.350] - Interviewer
Okay, so when you have a funnel, that's kind of an evergreen thing that's going. And you're probably... Unless again, you're way out there in term of advanced doing weekly emails or broadcast. How do you sort of plan out your promotions to align with those? Whether it's like an affiliate promotion or say, okay, that month, I'm going to promote this product. Do you kind of plan it out month by month or how do you sort of plan your promotions, I guess? 

[00:08:49.170] - Kate
That is a great thing and realize that you can always leave room for inspiration. But I think having a plan because human brains, like, they need to have a closed-loop, or they just, like, expand regardless, if you've got ADHD like, I do or not, it's just the way that a human brain works. So what I like to do when I'm sort of planning my broadcast or my month, I'm usually one of those people that's, like, three months at a time. And this is only recently because my VA is like, you need to start planning around in advance. It's like, oh, next week is next month.

[00:09:22.870] - Kate
What am I going to do next month, right?

[00:09:24.670] - Kate
So, realize if you're not a big planner, you can start with just knowing next month. So you're going to look at next month. And what I like to look at is, do I personally want to be doing anything that month to say that, again, maybe you do have a signature program? Maybe you've been looking to sell some principles. Maybe, you know, that it's going to be Black Friday, or you're going to be capitalizing on January spirit or, you know, in February when you fell off the wagon.

[00:09:49.330] - Kate
So you want to be doing a promotion that you've got around there. So you're looking at what am I going to do this month? And sometimes you can look at what am I going to do next month as well, in case if you need to be setting anything up. So the thing that I like to look at is, okay, if you already have a product, is there anything that's kind of just tickling my fancy to feature because you don't have to have a big sale, you don't have to have a discount.

[00:10:11.050] - Kate
It can literally be something where, say, if I decide that I want to highlight the email marketing ferry for two weeks, right? Like, yeah, I could give away one of the free templates right from it. That's pretty direct. And if you want the rest of them, go ahead and buy them here, right?

[00:10:24.970] - Kate
We've got to make sure that the free template they weren't aware where it came from. There's a link to go buy the whole thing, but it could just be one of those things where I can give tips on how to figure out ideas for your weekly newsletters when you don't have any and you're not feeling creative, and then I can have a PS as a bunch. If you really don't feel like writing them. I got 30 of them here in this product. So it's just like a really casual mention of something. I have a student that is in the budgeting space.

[00:10:53.170] - Kate
And so what we did for her at the beginning because she was really sales averse, and that's what I found that a lot of people are just so nervous for asking for money. This is for you, like, pipe up your ears. So what she would do is she would do her normal newsletter content. And anyone where she wasn't linking to what we consider something really important. So that's not real. Not every blog post is super important, guys, like, you know, your pillar post versus the ones that you just kind of put out there, like, we all have them, right? So anytime that she wasn't linking to, like, a pillar post or say, I couldn't get her do webinar. But any time it was super pivotal, she wouldn't do this. But in all the other ones where she was just casually teaching, she wasn't linking out to anything. They were just looking at your Instagram. Maybe it was nothing. We literally just put at the bottom of her emails. You can say PS, or you can say nothing. She just had other ways that can help you. And then she had three of her products, she had taglines for them. And really what this tagline was? It wasn't anything clever, guys. It was the problem - if you're having this, check this out type of a deal. And so we made sure for her three products that are on the budgeting space that if this is a problem, it was really specific. So it's not just like, oh, you can't grow your audience. It would be like if you have an opt-in in form on every single one of your blog posts and your email list, it's still five. Click here.

[00:12:12.910] - Kate
And then every single time she sent an email, she would make money. Again, her products weren't huge because they were in the budgeting space. Like, she just got addicted. And then she got more comfortable actually creating sales emails, which... Spoiler - every email is a sales email, you know, it was the truth, right? Like, every email you're selling this fact that you get your people, that you're going to be there for them, that you're knowledgeable, that you're in their corner, that they're not alone. So you're constantly selling.

[00:12:41.530] - Kate
You're constantly selling in there. It's a matter of you're asking for money, but she got more comfortable. But again, for starting that footer, just advertising her own stuff because I guarantee a few emails... I can do this with mine. If you emailed your whole list right now and you ask them, what do I sell? People aren't going to know.

[00:12:58.750] - Interviewer
That's one experiment that I need to do.

[00:13:02.770] - Kate
I don't think most people honestly have the nerve to do that. But if you're like, do you know what I say? Do you know what I have for sale? Just wondering. Again, since we're in the B to B space, business to business, it's a lot easier just to be honest. Yes, with business to consumers, it could be a little odd, but a lot of people won't even know. They're like, oh, my goodness. I didn't know you had that. We assume that people are, like, stock or level a million with us. And don't get me wrong.

[00:13:29.750] - Kate
You will have super fans. You will, but 98% of people...

[00:13:34.610] - Interviewer
And it will weird you out and you're like, did you make a mistake? You bought everything I have.

[00:13:40.670] - Kate
Isn't that right? My favorite is when they buy something twice, but you used it. Is this so bad that you forgot you had it? Oh, no. It's just like, really, it was really good. It's a great sales message. I'm going to sell you, I thought it was different than the other one. It will happen. But again, you need to, and this is why I wanted intermediate, because again, you kind of got your footing, you know where you're going, and now you're getting into sales. And that's why I really thrive, because treat people like people, right? When you throw down cash for something like the All Access Pass, like the pro pass.

[00:14:14.510] - Kate
I'm not saying that you guys aren't going to do stuff from watching the free because you probably might. But human beings value the things that they pay for. It's just the truth. Think about it. If I am going to shell out $50 for something, I'm going to make sure I'm going to get my $50 worth, right? Again, this is why I do this all the time, It's the truth.

[00:14:32.990] - Kate
I've got my wedding purse, which is my next Gucci bag, and I've got my target everyday thing that honestly had a melted protein bar in it today. Shouldn't leave my purse in the trunk and protein bar. I made that mistake. So people value things that they pay for. They'll take it a little bit more seriously. So just give them the chance to take themselves more seriously. If you're like, I could never sell my principals for $50, then don't put $50 on that price tag. That's not what I'm asking you to do.

[00:15:00.290] - Kate
I'm just asking you to give them a chance to take themselves more seriously. So shove a price tag on there. It could be $2. I do not care. Tell them about something you've got for sale.

[00:15:10.730] - Interviewer
And I have two thoughts that came to mind as you were talking. One) It kind of goes back, but if you miss a week, don't say anything about it. They're going to just think that they missed your email. People's inboxes are ridiculous. So you don't need to bring attention to the fact that you missed a week. And then the second thing I wanted to say is there are so many templates out there for, like, how to write a sales email or whatever. And they're great. But if they don't sound like you, it's not going to work. If you're writing it and you're like, okay, I've worked really hard and I filled it out, but it's a sales email, and you're not 100% behind it. You're not going to sell, make it yours. So if you and your audience aren't people that need 17 emails in a week during a launch, don't be that person.

[00:16:00.590] - Interviewer
My audience. I'm like, guys, I'm tired. Like I have other things to do, here's what you need to know a lot of times. That's what it is. I'm not emailing 17 times. I've tried those things. I've tried really tons of emails where they're like, last chance and stuff. And I haven't seen a difference. And it's because my audience knows me, and it's really just not my style to be like, buy now! Buy now! If you want it, get it.

[00:16:30.030] - Kate
I think that's really important because people will read energies. That is probably what makes what I teach different about email marketing than everybody else, because nobody talks energetic. Like, if you're coming at something with desperate energy or, like, I need cash, it's never going to work. People can see right through it. And you might be like, they're never going to know. They're going to know. They are going to know, they're going to be like, oh, my goodness. Again, in the B to B space, their quarterly taxes are due.

[00:16:57.570] - Kate
That's obviously why they're running this sale or, oh, like, I heard their launch flops, and now they're just trying to recoup some costs. People can feel that when it's like, no, we just had our big launch of this course, and I realized it's an investment for a lot of people, which is why I wanted to give you the sort of smaller version. It's going to help you with this and this. So that way, next time around, when we launch, you're going to be ready to go and you're going to be a step ahead.

[00:17:22.590] - Kate
Which one sounds better? Like, oh, yeah, I'm having a fresh flash sale on this bottom thing. Or because I know that this is an issue that you have. Here's why I'm doing this. And when you put your people first, that matters, and they're going to be able to hear the sincerity in your words. 

[00:17:39.750] - Interviewer
Yeah. It's also the fact that they are your people, right. That goes back to one of the biggest aha moments I had learning from you is that it's a privilege to be on your list. And the people that aren't your people.

[00:17:51.210] - Kate
Yeah, they're not allowed. Again, we very rarely get anybody replying back with nasty messages like ever. And if I do, I'm like, what did they sign up for? How do they not know that this is how I am and they're not allowed to be in here? So I'm like, I'm mad at my landing pages and like, I'm mad at my freebies. I'm like, you are not allowed to be here. You cannot hang out with us. I know I'm not everyone's cup of tea. I would rather you find anyone like, I am so passionate.

[00:18:18.570] - Kate
I know that you are as well. I am so passionate about putting money in the hands of good people. I don't care who you learn email marketing from, you just need to because it's effective. And when you learn how to write a great email, guess what guys? It's going to turn into a great Instagram caption. It's going to turn into great sales page copy. It's going to turn into great Facebook post. It gets engagement, because when you learn how to write words that move people, amazing things are going to happen. You just have to be brave enough to actually do it. 

[00:18:49.650] - Interviewer
Yes, yes. And again, like you said, if you are embarrassed by what you did before, then you're not writing enough. You could fringe so hard at, like, your first blog post or your first email.

[00:19:02.670] - Kate
Right, but you need to be proud of yourself that you actually did. You cannot learn how to swim from reading a book. You've got to go in the Lake, you've got to go in the pool and you've got to be bad at it. But if you're not allowing yourself to be bad at it, then this is going to get this question. And it's probably one for this list building that might have come up as well. How many people should you have on your email list before you start emailing regularly?

[00:19:25.110] - Kate
The answer is one, it's you. Would you rather practice your cool Ukulele in front of 10,000 people or 4? You'd rather practice it in front of 4. So that way, by the time you get to 10,000, you're a well-oiled machine. And even if you have an off day, who cares? You realize it's just one of the many emails that's going to go out and it's cool. 

[00:19:47.490] - Interviewer
Yes, I think one of my favorite quotes I've ever heard is amateurs practice until they get it right. Professionals practice until they can't get it wrong.

[00:19:54.690] - Kate
I absolutely love that quote. And to go back to one of your original questions about, well, how do we actually sort of plan out our month. Again, what are you doing?

[00:20:03.630] - Kate
What is going on seasonally is a really big one and what do you know, kind of happens around it? So say, you are an affiliate for a program and you know that in March, that's when they tend to do their big launches. Some people will tell you out of time, I'm really proud of my affiliates. I tell them like, two weeks ahead of time. But if you kind of know that it's coming, then you can plan around it and it's like, oh, yeah, you know what? I know that the course about Crocheting, she tends to really go hard for it around March for some strange reason. I don't know. Maybe she calls it. I was going to say October, but obviously that would be October at the time. So I need to make sure that maybe my last email is a month. I'm like, hey, guys, and if you're interested in learning a new skill besides just painting, I actually found this free event that's going to be starting, and then you can give them a link to the free event. You can talk about it a little bit more and just go with it.

[00:20:59.970] - Kate
When it comes to affiliate marketing and emails, in particular, the things that are going to work the best is your experience with it. So I know that some people that have Ginormous list from really big lifestyle blogs, which again goes the exact opposite of being on your list is a privileged mindset. But you might have followed that advice. That might be fine. They'll do things like sponsored emails. There is not enough money in the world to make you send a sponsored email, but I understand the allure of it for some people.

[00:21:29.370] - Kate
So you need to make sure if you are taking, I don't know, Windex's money. I don't have to do that. You're actually using Windex. Yeah, I would not use the Swipe copy that they're going to give you, that's the pre done email. Talk about your experience, talk about why it was bad, like that's the thing that if you really want to make affiliate money, talk about a downfall of something because people will be so blown away that you are honest that they'll be like, yeah, it's like, look, I'll be honest with you.

[00:21:55.650] - Kate
It is absolute crap for cleaning the microwave, but my windows in the kitchen have never looked better. So people are going to appreciate your honesty when you talk about a downfall or when you talk about results like, this is why it's so important that you've interacted with this. It's like, look, I've fallen off the fitness bag in a couple of times, but honestly, when I got back on like, this thing helped me lose 10 pounds and I didn't feel like hot trash all the time, which is really shocking, because most of the time I do and then that's when people are going to be like, yes, I will buy through your affiliate link. You're the best. 

[00:22:29.310] - Interviewer
Yes, and it doesn't even have to be about something you're promoting. Some of the most successful emails I've had this year, I've been bombarded. I was bombarded by tons of different bloggers about a tool that had just gone hard on marketing. And it was a good tool.

[00:22:44.730] - Interviewer
I was like, look, guys, I have nothing against this tool. I tried it, it's awesome, but it's pricey. If you want a cheaper alternative that works just as well, here you go. And they're like, oh my gosh. I got so many emails about that tool. I got so many responses. Thanks for not like, just adding to the noise of pushing that tool and giving me an alternative. I wasn't like saying, I'm like, it's not a bad product. It's great. I just don't want to spend that much money on it.

[00:23:11.430] - Kate
Right.

[00:23:12.150] - Interviewer
And just being honest, just honesty always wins with your people.

[00:23:16.050] - Kate
It really does. And I don't care what your style is. Honesty is everyone's style?

[00:23:20.670] - Interviewer
Yes, absolutely.

[00:23:24.670] - Interviewer
So let me just see if I had any other questions I wrote down.

[00:23:28.510] - Interviewer
Oh, yes. So I wanted to know. So when you're doing those sort of timely promotions, whether it be a flash sale or Black Friday or an affiliate promotion, do you include or exclude people that are still in your nurture sequence.

[00:23:40.930] - Kate
I will exclude them. The only time that I probably wouldn't would be say Black Friday, but their sequence is going to be slightly different. Meaning if they signed up for my list. And I don't know when Black Friday is. I mean, does anyone in 2022 know when Black Friday is? I don't know, but I don't know what it is. However, if they're joining me on Thursday and not for a waitlist because I would have a waitlist for my Black Friday offer, right? And not for that, I would probably send them an email that word is slightly different. During all of my big launches, I have the Carly Simon email. We talk about it inside of your list, and that is like, hey, I just met you, right? And honestly, I felt like kind of a moneygrubbing loser, like telling you about this deal we just met. Nobody likes that. But then I realized you joined my list for a reason, and it was X, Y, and Z, and this product can actually do that for you. So this is the only email that you're going to get about it.

[00:24:40.390] - Kate
Hopefully you're actually seeing it because I know your inbox is bombarded. But if you want to check out more, click here. If you have actual questions, reply back. And so send those to those people who are new. What I really hate to see is say you are doing something that's more of a live launch style, and somebody will join. And then they might not necessarily, especially if you're a business to consumer, say you're doing like a five-day becoming a plant mom challenge, right? And somebody joins on that fifth day.

[00:25:11.170] - Kate
So technically, the only thing that they're going to get is the fifth day and then a whole bunch of sales emails afterwards, like, kind of let people know what's coming. So that way they can expect it. And they're not just like, this person is really pushing this plant corner. I just met them. What's going on? Some people will be all about it. But again, when you come at it from that sort of, look, I know we just met. You might have just joined the challenge. I just want to let you know, like, this is what's happening.

[00:25:37.450] - Kate
This is why on all of my master classes, I don't hide the fact that I'm going to tell you about my program. Why would I? Maybe, even I...

[00:25:45.970] - Interviewer
You are not selling. You are giving them an opportunity to get something that will help them?

[00:25:48.670] - Kate
Yeah, like in the business-to-consumer space too. Like, honesty, this is like, the one thing that I can preach, honesty and connection. This is where we're going for here. Like, hey, guys, just so you know, I'm going to be telling you about this course. So if you want a little extra help and if you want access to me and you're tired of falling off the wagon, you're going to hear about something paid. I'm telling you this now. So that way you don't have to be like, where's the other shooter drop? What's going on here.

[00:26:10.150] - Kate
So you just focus on whatever the good free stuff is and then make a decision if you want to come hang out with me more, and they will appreciate it.

[00:26:17.950] - Interviewer
I always love all the examples you give. We got plant moms, we've got crochet.

[00:26:22.630] - Kate
My audience is the coolest. I will get some people that are business to business. Usually they end up turning into copywriters for a while, which is really funny after going through love realist, which is totally cool. I love it because they get so good at it. But we have so many [inaudible 00:26:38] finish. We have a lot of artists. We have someone who's teaching personal chefs. We have another person who's doing sugar cookies. It's the coolest things ever. And again, treating people like people works. And I'm not about super aggressive tactics.

[00:26:53.530] - Kate
Like, you can get away with a lot when you sell business to business, like bloggers to other bloggers, marketers to other marketers, coaches to coaches. You coach coaches. You can be on there. But if you're trying to do that to like, a normal consumer, people will dislike you.

[00:27:10.450] - Interviewer
Yeah. Think of it as like, I feel like when you start blogging, you know what affiliate marketing is? You know all these things. And if your sister or your friend is like, what are you doing and you're like, oh, I'm blogging. They're like, what does that mean? So you got to think of, like, the people who don't have any clue what you're doing and talk to them if that's your audience.

[00:27:30.070] - Kate
100%. But again, if you can always show somebody how something is going to make their life easier. How it's going to help them to avoid something? And then again, in our cases, because again, we value honesty, letting them know about any shortcomings, then they'll be all good. Again, what is this? How is it different? Buy right now? Those are really the three questions that you need to be answering.

[00:27:52.870] - Interviewer
Yes, I like it. All right. So let's wrap up. I believe you have a freebie for our audience.

[00:27:59.350] - Kate
Sure. So, I know that we have talked about this for a little bit about what do I actually send? And sometimes human brains just need concrete ideas, even if you do not even use them. So we have my two years worth of email ideas. So if you had over on katedoster.com/bbsummit. So just niche things for you guys.

[00:28:19.610] - Kate
katedoster.com/bbsummit. You're going to get my two years worth of strategically planned email ideas. And what I mean, strategic is at least one email that month is going to be a moneymaker. Technically, you can tag on a sales pitch any of the emails that you're going to get for that month. But it's not just like, here's a list of 104 emails, go pick it out. You're like, this is like, no, it's January. You're sending us week one, week two, week three. If you're watching this and you're like, but Kate it's June turns out that January comes back, so you are fine.

[00:28:50.390] - Kate
Just go back. You are good. You're not missing out. Things aren't going to fail and then go from there. I have some students who like to use it verbatim. I have some people, like, to pick and choose or be like, oh, yeah, you said to share, like, three mistakes about this, which actually reminded me about something that I saw online. It was just awful.

[00:29:06.530] - Kate
So then I talked about that instead. Again, just giving your brain something to work with makes it so much easier than, like, I have to write everything in a mail of emails too. It's four. Oh, I need to share some tools, some mistakes, a blog post. And I need to talk about something that's an affiliate one. I can do that. And I can shove in whatever order I want.

[00:29:26.870] - Interviewer
I'm sitting here and being like, okay, I need to go back and look at that because it is really good. I like that broken up by month, and I was like, I should really do that. My newsletters, I'm like, here's the new stuff. I've had a lot going on.

[00:29:39.590] - Kate
Right. And again for you, it's really nice. I don't want to say it's easier for me to be, because it's not. I think that it's really great because good consumer based emails, again, everything besides blogging about blogging I feel are so hard to come by at this point. It's almost like shooting fish in a barrel in that case. But this is when you're like, hey, guys, today I was recording this podcast episode for the Summit and can I just tell you like, I have been overwhelmed? Thank goodness.

[00:30:01.550] - Kate
I've got... To click off a sauna, whichever one you like, whichever one you're affiliate for, because it's keeping me organized because it is a hot mess. And I want to know, like, what are you hot messing about right now? How's your quarter for? That's it. So they can be like, oh, my God. I thought I was the only one who didn't have my act together. So exciting that you do. Let me go check this out, and that's all your email needs to be, which is really nice. Why?

[00:30:22.670] - Kate
Just like we've said before, being on your list is a privilege. You're going to attract people that are like you. I mean, they won't have to be as obsessed with Harry Potter as you are, but pretty close. So when you can relate Harry Potter to whatever is currently going on in your life, chances are they're going to want to hear about it, too. 

[00:30:40.310] - Interviewer
Yes. All right. Awesome, guys.

[00:30:41.750] - Interviewer
Definitely go get that. So, katedoster.com/bbsummit. I'm telling you, it is excellent. I refer back to all the stuff I've gotten from Kate all the time. I've got it turned out in notebooks because my brain just works better that way. I'm sorry to the trees. Kate, thank you so much for being here. Any final words?

[00:31:03.110] - Kate
Definitely get the all access pass. If you guys haven't done that or the pro one, they're both amazing. I have to say, you have so many great speakers. I know I'm like, which ones do? [inaudible 00:31:12] 

[00:31:16.850] - Kate
So exciting. That's really great to do that. Do not be afraid to email your list. I know that this is if I can boil it down to anything, it's always when it comes to email marketing and honestly, sales-list growth in general, all of it. Do the brave thing. There's nothing brave about creating four Pinterest graphics. There's something brave about going and asking somebody in the BB Facebook group - hey, who wants to do a freebie spot with me? It is telling your list, hey, I've got this $17 offer.

[00:31:48.590] - Kate
Do the brave thing. When you default to that, the growth you're going to see is exponential. Exponential! Do the brave thing. 

[00:31:58.490] - Interviewer
Yes. Awesome. Thank you, guys. We will catch you at the next session.
