Because she wants everyone, every entrepreneur like you, to rise and be the star of their own business. Because a big break isn't something you wait for, it's something you make. So, super excited. Liz Theresa is back. Liz, thank you again for joining us. I love chatting with you.

[00:00:46.180] - Liz Theresa
Oh, my God. Same. We're terribly awesome together too. So, I'm thrilled to be here.

[00:00:51.910] - Liz Stapleton
Yes. Yes. So, we're going to be talking about mission statements. Before we really dive in, let's maybe explain what that is.

[00:01:00.520] - Liz Theresa
Yeah. No, I think it's funny because I think if you ask people on the street what's a mission statement, they might say, like, it's something a nonprofit has, and then they're like, that's like your first thing. You're like, well, it's for people that save whales, or it's for people that you know are fixing the ozone layer. But the truth is that we all have mission statements. It's just a matter of not, like whether or not you're looking at it or not, or whether or not you seek to acknowledge it. It's sort of when I say everybody has a brand, it's just whether or not you want to acknowledge it, it's going to be out in the room with you all the time. Your mission is always there too. It's just not always articulated.

[00:01:43.690] - Liz Stapleton
Yeah. I think it's almost articulating what your values are to a certain extent, right. Because you will see because it happens when you see someone they're like. I don't really like how they do that in their business. Well, that's establishing what your values are, which is how you're different. And it's not that you think anything like if that's their thing, right, but not quite the same.

[00:02:06.250] - Liz Theresa
Well, values is one of my favorite thing to amplify because people don't amplify it enough. But what a wonderful example I'm calling it out because it is. It's when you, values is when you smell somebody's smell and you're like, oh, I don't like that, that's stinky. And you know not to be that way.

[00:02:21.790] - Liz Stapleton
Yes. Okay. So, now we have an idea that, yes, everyone's going to have a mission statement whether they realize it or not. Let's talk about what copywriting is because it's a little bit of a scary term for some people. And we are talking about copywriting in the sense of writing copy or words as opposed to the legal sense. We have other sessions on that. But if you want to kind of explain copywriting, so people cannot forget about it.

[00:02:49.210] - Liz Theresa
Yeah. and I would say, so when you write your mission statement, it would be part of the copywriting for your website. And copy, I like to make it so simple, it's any words you use in your marketing anytime. So, marketing being the big globby word for your website, any physical materials, and anytime you talk about your business, that's all copy, and it's the written form for it.

[00:03:14.890] - Liz Stapleton
Okay. So, how do you come up with a mission statement?

[00:03:18.750] - Liz Theresa
No, this is such a good question. So, I came up with a little template for everybody listening today because I wanted to make it easy. And I'm calling this your one-sentence version of your mission. Aside from kind of communicating values, too, what I like to remind people is that it communicates your impact and the difference that you make in people's lives. What's funny is that when I started my business, I remember specifically not thinking about other people. I just really didn't want a job, and so that's just the truth. I didn't want to work for anybody. I had a bad boss. I was like, that's not for me. So, when I started my business, I thought I was starting it, so I could get like a mani pedi whenever I wanted, so I could make some money, buy an iPad. I didn't have like, I think it's sometimes we have to remember to have a pulse that we do make an impact. It's whether or not we notice. So, it's sort of like the mission idea. When I'm like, you have a mission, it's whether or not you articulate it. You make an impact by existing.

[00:04:20.050] - Liz Theresa
It's whether or not you're seeking to notice that .That's personal and professional, too. You know like the chain of love and the drivethru when you pay for the person behind you, that really makes a difference. And in your business, you're making a difference all the time. Or your blog, don't minify it because you are making an impact. You're making an impact on your reader. So, came up with a snappy template. It's a fill in the blank. And so, I'm going to guide you guys through that now. And so, it's I help blank, and I'm going to tell you what the blanks are, but you could even put this on a piece of paper, but the first blank is my ideal reader. So, think of your ideal demographic. I help moms, I help dads. I help not parents. I help women in service-based businesses. So, I help blank by providing blank. And so that second blank is the value that you provide. And so, the value is usually blog articles written weekly. It could be podcast recordings delivered monthly. It could be a group of things. So, think of all the different ways you're providing value. And sometimes that's easier to write before you write the sentence.

[00:05:28.840] - Liz Theresa
But I love a good template because it makes you walk away with something lovely. And so, I help my ideal reader by providing valuable content, probably, or something like that, so they can blank. And then I have another extension to the sentence for the really aspirational listeners, I want to add on, but I want to explain this blank first. But it goes so I help my ideal readers by providing valuable content, so they can, ideal results. So ideal result meaning like, in a perfect world, if they came to your blog and website and you could wave your Liz wands and like, they make them come out on the other side of the problem that you solve. So, whatever the problem you solve is as a website, what's this ideal outcome? I help people that come to my website, love their website because I'm teaching them how to love their website because all of a sudden their website is a lead converter. Okay, that's an example of one. So what is your ideal outcome for travel bloggers that specialize in a location? This is just an example. I help you come to Miami and know what it is to see when you get here because the city's really freaking awesome.

[00:06:42.060] - Liz Theresa
And here's all the reasons why. Just an example. So you could think about what that ideal statement is. And that's the thing that you slot in. What were you going to say? Because you're going to say something.

[00:06:52.390] - Liz Stapleton
No, I'm just in my head going through it, being like, I help bloggers and aspiring bloggers, you know, by providing annual summit with amazing actionable training so that they can earn more with their blog and work less.

[00:07:07.690] - Liz Theresa
If I highfive my monitor, it would get hurt. But I want to because that was so good. What a fabulous example. So, then actually you did this SEO then, so they can tell us what it was.

[00:07:20.280] - Liz Stapleton
So, they can spend less time working on their blog and earning more or something like that.

[00:07:24.510] - Liz Theresa
Okay, yeah.

[00:07:24.910] - Liz Stapleton
Definitely, like rewind the recording and be like, what did I say?

[00:07:28.050] - Liz Theresa
No, that was really lovely. Okay, and then, so for people that did this first part, and you guys want to like add some vision to your mission, because sometimes people think of mission, vision and values, they all get kind of, like they're all swimming in the same pond, you know what I'm saying? So, if you want to make this mission statement also visionary in nature and touch on a vision statement without having to write one, you could also add so that to the end of the sentence. So, like, if you're helping bloggers make more money with their blog, so that they can what was it? Not have to work that hard in their life. So, they could spend less time working on their working and more time, living their life, hugging their puppy. Everybody should get a puppy. But yeah, no that's, I thought, but yeah, when you do that so they can, that's where you get people right in the fields. In good missions, get people in the fields because it increases, like know and trust. And it also gives people a reason to think of you as a community. Because everybody's like, oh, I'm a community. This is a community.

[00:08:34.540] - Liz Theresa
Join my community. I saw an ad or some kind of post about, like, I just want to buy socks. So, I don't have to join a community to buy socks. Like some people do say that.

[00:08:43.630] - Liz Stapleton
Yeah.

[00:08:44.530] - Liz Theresa
But some brands really are communities because you know what they stand for. You'll pay $20 for bombas, those are comfy. Those are the socks.

[00:08:54.430] - Liz Stapleton
They are really comfortable. i have some.

[00:08:55.470] - Liz Theresa
Yeah. I kind of get it with them, I feel like they justify it.

[00:09:01.480] - Liz Stapleton
Okay. All right. So, I love the sort of like, fill in the blank aspect of it, but it can get super wordy. It can get super long. So, how long really should kind of your, I mean, obviously you can have, like, a long mission statement somewhere on your site, but you're, like, go to it's on your social. Actually, let's step back. Where would you put your mission statement, this nice little thing you've come up with?

[00:09:29.080] - Liz Theresa
I like to have it easily accessible on every page, if possible. Even if it was silently in your sidebar or footer, you always want to be communicating it. It can become a long run on sentence by the fill in the blank exercise. So, if you broke it into two, you wouldn't be breaking hearts. You'd be helping ears and eyes. So, it's totally okay to do that. I'm not the person that goes so far as to say you have to put it in every single bio everywhere, but you want it to be very, very clear. There are possibilities too, when you think about blogging, that you could append it to the beginning of every post in italics, as, like, a quiet thing that you say every single time you publish new content. Because then it kind of reminds people who you are, what you stand for, and why should I read you and not somebody else? It can kind of reinforce that, and it increases your brand equity. It makes you seem way more important than you might even know you are, because you are important. This is the thing I want to, like, shake everyone.

[00:10:28.140] - Liz Theresa
You all matter. You really do. It's very Mr. Rogers, but it's true. And the second you accept and believe that, the more likely other people will believe it, too.

[00:10:38.660] - Liz Stapleton
Yes. You know, I feel like don't make the mistake of just maybe you don't have a huge audience or as huge of an audience. Like don't compare yourself. Even if you have a small audience, you're making a difference for those people, and it matters. So, don't let comparisons sort of ruin that realization.

[00:10:58.780] - Liz Theresa
And a lot of people, I saw a post last night where somebody said two people bought her program or something, whatever she was selling, from a post that got no engagement, no likes, no comments. And sometimes when we get no likes, no comments on a post we make about a blog post. Right. It's a little meta, but then we think, well, this silence, so all I got was crickets. Well, no, crickets read. Jiminy was very well read, you know. So that's what I would say.

[00:11:29.510] - Liz Stapleton
Yes. You know because not everyone comments, even like and I know that it would be like, so appreciated. Right. And I still like, people are busy. It doesn't mean not commenting or something, doesn't mean they didn't absolutely love it or find a lot of value in it.

[00:11:46.150] - Liz Theresa
It's true. Good reminder.

[00:11:49.840] - Liz Stapleton
It's hard to get people to take action to tell you you're awesome.

[00:11:52.910] - Liz Theresa
And it's the same reason why I think people will start blogs and quit too early. Because they expect it to be like, I blogged, therefore I am. And it's not always like this big show, you know. 

[00:12:05.620] - Liz Stapleton
Yeah. I would think I give it at least a year. Everyone who I think does it for at least a year is like, [inaudible 00:12:09] forever.

[00:12:11.590] - Liz Theresa
Yeah, they get it too. And it's like an education.

[00:12:14.440] - Liz Stapleton
Yes. Okay. So, now we kind of talked about different places you're going to have your mission statement. Let's talk about length, because it can get really long, it can get really wordy, kind of what's the ideal? How do you trim the fat? What you know tips you have in that regard?

[00:12:30.260] - Liz Theresa
I usually say they should be two to three sentences max in general. So, like, don't confuse a mission with your about page. So, sometimes I think a common mistake that happens is people tell a story in a mission. When you can allude to the story, just thinking of an example. Like, I think Patagonia's mission that's like the company with the really nice coats. And so basically their mission is something like, oh, we started as, something about how they started really small, like a mom and pop, people that made backpacks or something. And then now look at us today. You can like allude to something like that. But the reason why I gave you the template is because I don't want you to say more than those blanks. Those are the big things, the checkboxes to communicate, especially if you're also going to spend time and write a vision statement, because your vision statement is also short. But that's like when people think about missions and visions, I have to make your mission a little aspirational. And then you have two in one. It's less, right. It's less stuff to read for people, but visions, like, if you ever wanted to know what a vision was, it's really like your Oprah statement, I'm changing lives every day because Liz Theresa's this, that and the other.

[00:13:44.550] - Liz Theresa
I'm the number one. Dah dah dah dah dah dah. You know, and it might not be true stuff, but it's stuff that you're aspiring to be true. Okay. So that's something that people get confused. If you make your mission a little aspirational, you get two to three sentences and you can accomplish your goal.

[00:13:59.660] - Liz Stapleton
Okay. Yeah. Because what is the goal of the mission statement, in case anyone is a little unclear on that?

[00:14:06.420] - Liz Theresa
So, in my opinion, it defines your values it says why you're doing what you're doing and the impact that you're making. And then the side effect of saying it is that it helps you adhere to those values from a content creation standpoint, because then as you're creating and planning your content, you're going to be like, naturally in alignment. They'll make you less scattered and more niche. Everybody's all like, I got a niche. I got a niche down. I got to find my ideal reader. Well, they're not hanging out somewhere, but if you do this kind of an exercise, you might settle on who they are a little bit more clearly and think about them more consciously in your own marketing. So, internally, very helpful. Externally, your reader will know how you can fit into their reality. So, then your blog becomes something that like, oh, you know, I'm going to check and see what Elizabeth would say about this. Because, like, I know and I trust her because I know she does this stuff. And they might know and trust you because you've been so explicit, but that's what this community is about.

[00:15:05.290] - Liz Stapleton
Yeah. So, it's also helping to define your community, and the community you're creating, I think, is kind of woven in there.

[00:15:15.030] - Liz Theresa
Yeah. Except that you're creating a community whether or not you notice. There's so many things we do, and it's whether or not we notice or willing to call it that.

[00:15:23.960] - Liz Stapleton
Yeah, exactly. The other thing I realized the other day is I'm like, if I were to look at you know, someone's blog and give them advice. You know, okay, now I need to turn around and follow my own advice, because you don't even realize, like, oh, yeah, this is how you do it. But then you look back and you're like, oh, apparently I'm not actually doing that right now.

[00:15:43.540] - Liz Theresa
Makes me wonder about Liz Theresa. But yes, I'm with you. Okay. We do say our mission statements on the home page. Mission vision statement, if you actually want to look at mine, you guys. So good. It's really good. I like it a lot.

[00:15:58.960] - Liz Theresa
I like it a lot. And some people also feel, too, that they're living documents, and I would subscribe to that as well, which is to say, like, you could write something. You don't have to feel like, nothing in life is in stone. Nothing is permanent. So, it should be okay to update it. Oh, gosh, yeah.

[00:16:16.760] - Liz Stapleton
Yes, Yeah. But you don't want to like update it every month?

[00:16:19.980] - Liz Theresa
No, once a year.

[00:16:22.660] - Liz Stapleton
Okay.

[00:16:23.310] - Liz Theresa
And even then, it wouldn't be a big update. It might be like, well, do I really value that the same way that I used to?

[00:16:29.960] - Liz Stapleton
Yeah, because you'll pivot and stuff, too. Okay. So, if someone is struggling, even with your amazing templates, to come up with a clear mission statement, what advice would you have for them? What are some ways they can kind of work through that?

[00:16:47.380] - Liz Theresa
One of my favorite things to do is terrible bad writing, which I consider to be an exercise. So, if you could pick out a fresh piece of paper, if you're a real person that writes with your hand, or if you're a robot person like me, and you use the computer, pull up a brand new fresh dot. And I really think, like, if I said to you, why do you have this blog? And you really wrote all the different reasons why and you made like a why list about it, doesn't have to be good writing again, messier the better, because I don't want you to filter out the genius that is going to come out of you. And in there, in your why is oftentimes your mission. You'll see your impact in your why.

[00:17:28.090] - Liz Stapleton
Okay, I like that because then you kind of pick and choose different terms that come to mind as it goes. Next question is, what are mistakes you see in people, you knwo? I know you already said confusing it with an about page, but what are some other mistakes you see people making with their mission statement, you know, in crafting it and not displaying it or in displaying it weirdly? I don't know. Like you would know.

[00:17:55.110] - Liz Theresa
Oh, yeah. No, definitely. I think one of the most common mistakes is that I think because it's called a mission statement, it sounds so lofty and it sounds so regal and like stately, but I don't want you to lose your brand voice when creating it. It should still sound like something that you might actually say that you're doing. It's just something that you have to say that you're doing without laughing or without sounding like, I don't know, like a strange politician. Because sometimes, I think people make them sound stately and they use really grandiose words, even like the word grandiose is grandiose, right? And it's not necessary. I just want you to say what it is, you know?

[00:18:37.390] - Liz Stapleton
Yes, you know speak like or write like you talk, I should say.

[00:18:42.410] - Liz Theresa
Yeah, yeah. Because then people can hear it and understand it and absorb it better.

[00:18:47.290] - Liz Stapleton
Yes. Because I wasn't kidding when I said I was going to go back to this recording and be like, what did I say because that sounded good when I said it.

[00:18:53.380] - Liz Theresa
it's so good. I loved it. I loved it. I loved it.

[00:18:58.310] - Liz Stapleton
Okay, any final tips in sort of crafting a magnetic mission statement, as you put it in the title to draw people in? Any final tips?

[00:19:09.780] - Liz Theresa
Well, I think they can all learn a lesson from you in a good way, which is to say if your natural way of communicating is talking, maybe have a conversation with somebody about it and see what comes. If you were to talk instead of write. Because sometimes writing I know that we're all bloggers, but this is a different kind of writing. And so, sometimes when you're doing this weird kind of writing, you get weird. And if you're getting all funny when you're trying to do it, maybe talk to your mum or your best friend, just like, get it out. And then you'll be like, oh, it's so simple now. And then they'll repeat it back to you if it's not a recorded conversation. That's the key.

[00:19:46.240] - Liz Stapleton
There you go. Yeah, but don't be afraid to record. Go for a walk it out.

[00:19:50.610] - Liz Theresa
No, don't be afraid. Yeah. Great tip.

[00:19:52.500] - Liz Stapleton
