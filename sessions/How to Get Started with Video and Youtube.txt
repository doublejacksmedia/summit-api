[00:00:09.700] - Liz Stapleton, Summit Host
All right, guys, I'm super excited for today's session with my friend Tasha from One Big Happy Life. Tasha, welcome and thank you so much for being here.

[00:00:16.720] - Tasha Cochran, onebighappylife.com
Thank you so much for having me. I'm so excited to be here. I love talking about YouTube. So I guess I'll start off by telling you just a little bit about me.

[00:00:25.540] - Liz
Yes.

[00:00:25.750] - Tasha
So, my name is Tasha Cochran. I am a lawyer and a wealth expert, and my business is One Big Happy Life. And it started out entirely as a YouTube channel where I was talking about hair, of all things, and then it evolved into a personal finance and lifestyle design channel, which then my whole business grew out of. And now I run a multiple six figure business, which is really, really exciting. Over the past four years, I have been able to work with brands like Google and Sony and Adobe as brand partners for all my YouTube channel, we have over 17 million views and my YouTube channel is how I grow my audience and also find customers for our paid products; people who want to go deeper with us on the topics that we share about on YouTube.

[00:01:20.300] - Liz
You started YouTube kind of- do you want to talk mainly about sort of YouTube versus blogging and how they can go hand in hand or where they don't or your thoughts?

[00:01:30.760] - Tasha
Yeah, so the power of YouTube, at least especially for me, I love to write, but I am someone that gets writer's block like nobody's business. And so a blog post can take me a really long time to write, whereas very few people get speakers block, talkers block. And so for me, I just found that it was so much easier for me to get my ideas out on video with just a basic outline than it was to write a blog post. But the really powerful thing about YouTube in particular over blogging is that when you blog, okay, now you've got your content, but then you've got to figure out a way to push it out there. Right, and get it in front of eyes. So you either got to add on SEO or Pinterest or some other sort of social media marketing or paid advertising. But with YouTube, you have the YouTube algorithm, which is Google working for you right where you can show up in Google search. You show up on YouTube search because YouTube is a search platform. And it's constantly serving even your old content to new people. So, it's very much an evergreen platform. So that's why I prefer YouTube over blogging. But I also recognize and everyone should recognize that you don't own YouTube. So be very careful about building your audience and your entire business on some other platform that you don't own.

[00:02:55.510] - Tasha
You do on your blog. And so it's a great opportunity to put the two of them together so you can embed your videos on your blog, which gives your blog also SEO juice. Right. Because that's that additional asset in there.

[00:03:08.590] - Liz
Time on page.

[00:03:08.740] - Tasha
Exactly. And a lot of people, too, when they watch your videos on YouTube, some people like to read what you say, even after they've watched you say it, they want to go deeper. So it gives them this extra bit of value add to say, "Hey, go on over to my website and I've got it all written out for you in the blog post. You can follow it step by step and also opt in to my email list and get tagged by my Facebook pixel so that you can stay in my universe. There you go.

[00:03:38.360] - Liz
Yes. Okay, so I think one of the things that overwhelms people with doing video and YouTube is, you know, they feel scared of editing video and staying consistent, like "I can edit something out. Right. I've been doing that since third grade," you know. But video, how do you stay consistent with that? And like do how many systems in place that help you kind of stay on track of everything and keep it simple?

[00:04:02.320] - Tasha
Yes. So I can't see that video can be really challenging to stay on top of, especially for women when we feel like we have to present a certain made up face and hair done. And what are we wearing on video? And of course, that's entirely a style preference, right? Because you absolutely can show up on video, no makeup, same clothes every time, if that is your brand. But for someone like me, wear my brand looks like this. It takes probably about 35/40 minutes just for me to even get ready to show up on video. And so the key is to batch record. So, ideally if I'm putting on makeup, we're shooting three or four videos right. And so if- and then the next thing comes into play is your posting frequency. So to start out you only need to post, let's say, once a week. So if you can batch shoot four videos at a time, then it's like one set of work because you sit down and you shoot four videos and sure, all four can look exactly like the same outfit they make up. I think that's an. I really find I usually will switch out my shirt. But batch working is a great way to stay consistent. The other thing is keeping a never ending list of ideas. So, don't try to sit down and come up with an idea right then when you're about to shoot or you need to come up with four ideas because you're going to shoot in an hour. No, have a never ending list of ideas that you keep a running list of and so then when you're ready, you can just select your favorite ones in that moment from that list so that you're not trying to both be entirely creative and come up with things from scratch and also outlining those things and fleshing them out into full ideas.

[00:05:49.210] - Tasha
The other thing that I suggest is to have a set. So this is a set. It looks like this all the time. It's also known as my dining room. Here is my dining room table. And so it's just one wall of the house that we've made to look appealing for video so that we can just drop in and shoot a video whenever. So, I can go from not ready to shoot a video to ready to shoot a video excluding makeup in like two seconds, because all I have to do is turn all the lights on. So, you've just got to decide that video is going to be your thing and set yourself up for success by making everything easy and streamlined.

[00:06:32.120] - Liz
Yeah, so one thing I want to follow up on is once you have the idea outlining, I tend to work well from an outline and just talking through it. I don't necessarily need a full script. I know some people do. What are your thoughts on that on Teleprompter's? How simple or complicated does it need to be? I mean, different people have different needs, but...

[00:06:54.050] - Tasha
Yeah, so I have done it both ways for my own YouTube channel, we almost never use a teleprompter. The only time we'll ever use a teleprompter is sometimes when we work with brands, especially if it's a medical related brand or like health care or something like that or a bank. They are very specific about the words that they want you to use. And so we will read any branded part of the video directly from the teleprompter in those instances, because we can't just wing it because they will literally ask for a reshoot for one word. But most of the time on our own channel, what we have is an outline. And typically it used to be that Joseph and I would shoot videos together. And so when two people are shooting a video, you don't need as detailed an outline, because when one person is talking, the other person is thinking. But as I started shooting more and more videos by myself because I went full time in the business and Joseph is still working full time. So now the videos are like ninety five percent, just me. I found that I needed a more detailed outline so that my thoughts could flow better. But I generally do not prefer to write everything out word for word because it is very hard to read from a teleprompter and come across as convincing. I can do it now because I spent a year shooting a YouTube video show for the financial diet where I chose to fully scripted out because I didn't have a lot of time because I was still working full time. And over time I learned to read and have people not be able to tell that I was reading because I learned how to modulate my voice and also write better for a teleprompter. But it is way more work. It's a lot easier to just master the art of being able to speak on the fly. And the way that you do that is by just doing it. Your early videos, they're going to suck. So, if you really...

[00:08:49.620] - Liz
Go to your early blog post. Right, so same thing.

[00:08:51.790] - Tasha
Exactly. If you go to my early YouTube videos, one thing that I discovered very early on was the like the RBF, the resting bee face, like you cannot just be a normal person on video. You come across as really boring, but you don't know that at first. So, like my first YouTube videos, I'd be like this and I would talk like this before for a regular person is fine, but for video that is not fine. But it took me at this point we've made over four hundred videos, so the early ones suck. But I got better and better and better. And I got better at my messaging too, because I would watch the videos and say, "Okay, how did I say that? How could I have said that better? And so then you just get better on the fly."

[00:09:35.220] - Liz
Okay? Yeah. No, I do like that. So- and one thing and tell me if you do this, if you're recording, if you make a mistake, you just pause and go again and edit that out? Is that something that could save you a lot of time? I think people try to get everything perfect.

[00:09:49.130] - Tasha
Yes. So we are fairly lucky in that we tend to not have as many cuts. I have more cuts now when it's me by myself, because I forget what the next thing was that I was going to talk about. So, I have these pauses, but that's actually not a bad thing. A lot of video editors prefer to have more cuts in a video. So, we still do a lot of our own editing in-house. But sometimes we will have video editors edit for us and they're like, "Well, there weren't too many cuts in there. So, I added some visual interest because people are used to seeing changes a lot in television. So watching something where you're just sitting there for eight minutes straight talking, even if you're incredibly entertaining, is a little strange for people. So it's totally OK if you go a minute and then there was a cut because it's just like little it's called an in and out cut. So it's just these tiny little cuts that actually feel very natural to people. The only time that the cuts matter is like Facebook.

[00:10:48.710] - Tasha
So, you can repurpose your YouTube videos and also put them up on your Facebook business page. And so Facebook tends to like more like people on Facebook, tend to like the more live streaming videos that are that don't seem pre-recorded ones. If you. Yeah. So if you have a cut in a Facebook video, then it seems pre-recorded, then you really need to take your editing up a notch to make it look like a purposeful edit. Right. It's just like different takes Facebook versus YouTube. But even still, we throw our YouTube videos up on Facebook. We use them for like for ads and things like that, and they perform very well. So I would say give yourself some grace, allow yourself to have cuts, but I would say not too many cuts. So maybe try to keep your cuts, at least give them like a good thirty seconds. If you didn't talk for thirty seconds, then you're better off just starting from the beginning and saying it again.

[00:11:44.510] - Liz
Yeah. Okay, so then once I think people can figure out, OK, I've got an outline, there's a gazillion things you can use to record your phone. A photo booth on Mac, I'm sure there's an equivalent on PC. What do you once you've recorded. what do you do with the video? Where should you edit it? Editors can be overwhelming, you know- what- like for people just getting started. What would you suggest?

[00:12:09.650] - Tasha
So I will say that I have edited using Premier pro basically from the beginning. Now, in the very, very beginning, I had a Mac, so I used iMovie, but it was a MacBook Air and a MacBook Air cannot handle at least back then. I don't know what's going on with them right now. Couldn't really handle what I was trying to put them- put it through, which is basically simple cut. Now the great thing about iMovie is that it has some fun little- you can do things like add little end screens and add little titles in very easily where you as that is incredibly difficult to do in premier. Like you've got to know what you're doing and chances are you might even need to pull in after effects to get that to work. So that's the downside of premier pro. But you don't need any of that fancy stuff to be successful on YouTube. I still don't do any of the fancy graphics and editing on my video because I fully believe in that Parado principle. The 80/20 like 20% of your work gets you 80% of the result. And so I think that those fancy things are like part of that extra 20% that you don't even need when you're starting out too fancy.

[00:13:19.250] - Tasha
But I do like Premier Pro because I personally feel that it is very easy to use. You don't have to use any of the bells and whistles, but is very easy to use. And I like using kind of doing things right from the very beginning versus going with the cheapest thing and then having to do all these work arounds and spending time, which is a finite resource, when you could be spending money, which is infinite. So, I like Premier Pro, but having said that, there are free ones out there or cheaper ones like Mobaby, I think is one of them. Filmora. It's hard for me to say because I don't use them, but here's what I say- just keep it simple. You do not need a whole bunch of fancy editing. You don't need scribbles. You don't need titles. You don't need any of that stuff when you are just starting out. Don't let that stop you from getting started. All you really need is to sit down, shoot your video, do your intro, give your- tell them what you're going to be talking. First of all, tell them what you're going to be talking about. Do your intro, deliver your main content, have a call to action at the end and you're done. Right. You can add all of that other stuff later.

[00:14:32.690] - Liz
Yes. Okay. So, a couple follow up questions based on some of the things you said, what would you suggest? I know some people do storage on like external hard drives versus a computer. Is that something you recommend?

[00:14:46.290] - Tasha
So, we have done things a lot of different ways. It's been many a year now since we've been making YouTube videos. And so when we started, we edited on laptops. We still can edit on laptops. We just get really powerful PCs . And I know a lot of people are Mac people. And so they think that Macs are actually the better machine, but they're not when you're looking at high end specs. Right. So all of our laptops outperform high end Macs and they cost well, our desktop cost more than the highest end Mac. But like our laptops will cost less than the highest in Mac, but have better specs. So, that's why we are a PC business vs. an Apple business, because we do so much video editing. But ideally, you want to edit your video on the hard- on the local hard drive, because that puts having the video on an external hard drive just puts more of a demand on your computer. So you just need enough space on your local hard drive for you to transfer those videos over and edit that when you're done editing them, then you can save them on an external hard drive. You do not want to keep them on your computer because they take up a ton of space.

[00:16:05.850] - Tasha
So, we actually have multiple servers in our house to store all of our because all of our videos for 4K, which is like four times the size of standard HD and over the years that stuff adds up and I haven't been wanting to get rid of any of the footage. And so here we are like I don't even know how many terabytes later of storage trying to keep up with it. But just to start out, start with like a one terabyte external hard drive, they're like 100 bucks- it's not cheap at all- not expensive at all.

[00:16:36.930] - Liz
They're like cheaper now like 50 or 60.

[00:16:38.130] - Tasha
Oh really?

[00:16:38.790] - Liz
Yes. And black- you know, like you look at sales, Black Friday, New Year, holiday sales, like you could find them cheaper.

[00:16:46.020] - Tasha
Exactly. And you could also choose to not keep all of your original footage. It's not- see, we did, especially in the beginning we were doing a lot of family vlogs and things like that. We did brand partnerships with Visit Florida. So we went down to the Florida Keys and have all kinds of footage as a family there. So it's almost like home movies that I don't want to get rid of. But for you, like our talk or videos where I'm like, you know, five ways to build wealth this year, we can get rid of that corporate and just keep the final file. Right, the final rendered video. So that can save you a ton of space, too.

[00:17:22.620] - Liz
Yeah, Okay. And then the other question I wanted to follow-up on, I feel like sound is the most important part because people kind of listen and work on something like they won't necessarily be watching you hard core. So, sound like I'm no sound expert. I mostly am like remove background noise and make sure it's not too loud, you know, any tips on sort of the sound to make sure that you have a good consistent sound?

[00:17:46.830] - Tasha
Yes. The closer the mic is to your mouth, the better your sound will be. So, in this case, with a zoom call, I actually I'm going to try to pick this up and hope that it doesn't make too much noise. But you can see I'm bringing this closer to my mouth and it sounds a little different. It sounds better, right? I don't have to speak as loud. And then when I take it further away, I have to raise my voice. But then that introduces more noise into the room. So the Yeti, the blue Yeti is what I use for live streaming. And if I'm live streaming in this room because I actually now have a second set in my office right at my office desk with a Podcast mic. But I will use the Yeti for live streaming. But if we are shooting- I wonder if I can- let me see if I can pop this off so you guys can see it. This is a zoom eight six. It's hanging right over my head, just out of sight on a boom pole. And so it's dangling down and pointing at me. And so normally this is what we record our sound on now. But this bad boy is was something we upgraded to later. I think this is a good place to start. Or you can go even cheaper. The zoom H1 is like the tiny baby brother to this. And for a while we would just put it right on the table, right in front of us. And it doesn't have this on it. So, you can't see it and you can connect a cheap $20 Lav mic to it and plug it in right here or even cheaper than that record. Do the same thing but record on your phone.

[00:19:19.620] - Liz
Yeah.

[00:19:20.010] - Tasha
The annoying thing about recording on your phone is that you then got to get the recording over to your computer and it's not- so you've got to plug it into your computer. I just find it a little bit extra hassle, but it's cheaper than buying an entirely new piece of equipment.

[00:19:33.840] - Liz
True.

[00:19:34.830] - Tasha
Having said that, I truly believe in investing in your business and investing in the equipment that you need to show up pro, because if you invest in your business, your business will grow and thrive. So we have always invested. We just didn't start with, you know, higher end things. We started out with things that cost maybe $50, $100 and slowly built up our gear over time.

[00:20:02.410] - Liz
Yeah. Okay, so we've covered storage and sound and recording equipment, I feel like we should just go and touch on lights.

[00:20:13.090] - Tasha
Lights, lighting. Okay, please burn your ring lights. Burn them. Okay, like just toss them out because here's the thing; I think that people thought that ring lights were the Holy Grail because beauty bloggers use ring lights. That's where they came from because beauty bloggers were super close to the camera. They wanted all this like an evenly lit face. Why? Because they contour their face, so it doesn't matter if their faces flat from light, because they add it back in with makeup. But for regular people, a more flattering look is to have your light coming from like two different areas.

[00:20:50.680] - Tasha
So I have a soft box here and a soft box here. And I'm in a room that has zero light. Basically, I've got two windows that might as well be walls because there's so little light that comes in. But in my office it is a bright room. So, as long as the sun is out, there's plenty of light there. And so with a good camera, which IPhones now have- cameras are plenty good. You don't need any extra light.

[00:21:17.710] - Liz
Yeah.

[00:21:18.550] - Tasha
So if you have some great natural light, if you can sit in front of a window then you may not need any extra light. But if you have a dark room like I do, that's the only option, then you're going to need two soft boxes on either side of you. And again, these aren't expensive either. You can get two for like one hundred bucks.

[00:21:35.470] - Liz
Yeah, I think I got mine for 160. I'm using right now because I loan them out to my sister. But I have a window right here and I was like if I turned it would be better, but that just didn't work out with the way the room was. So I keep the blinds closed behind me because otherwise it wouldn't be much.

[00:21:50.560] - Tasha
That's what I had going on too. And so we spent a day and rearranged our entire office so that I could have one window in front of me and one to the side. And so now I don't absolutely- I don't have to have any light in that room except for if I'm trying to do something after the sun has set, which can happen in winter when the sun is gone at five o'clock.

[00:22:11.050] - Liz
Yeah.

[00:22:11.200] - Tasha
And so I do actually have a ring light in the office, but it's way off to the side and it's tilted up. And so then I can crank that sucker up and the light will bounce off the ceiling and hit my face. So, never even coming directly to me.

[00:22:24.400] - Liz
Yeah, I actually I do have a light going on right now, but it's like the lowest setting and it's a ways away. Yeah.

[00:22:30.730] - Tasha
As long as a ring light is fine, it just shouldn't be right in front of your face. You can put it off to the side if you already have one, don't get rid of it. It'll work just fine. And I actually like that they can adjust because these lights here that I have, they don't adjust quite as much. There's like two levels, basically. And that's it.

[00:22:49.570] - Liz
Yeah. No, I agree. Yeah. So okay. Any other any final words for people who are willing to do YouTube in conjunction with their blog or get started on YouTube- a real strategy?

[00:23:00.310] - Tasha
Well, yeah, I would say just get started. So I've got to just get started because too many people per use, right? Business owners, we overthink everything and we think that it has to be perfect in order for us to get started. But that's absolutely not the case. You look at our old videos. In fact, my very first video was a hair video and it is yellow as all get out with just yellow. The color is awful. The angles are awful. The sound is awful. It was a T five I, I wasn't trying to start a YouTube channel. I was just trying to make a YouTube video and put it up because I thought that it would be helpful to other people. And even when I was thinking, Okay, well now I'm going to do this YouTube channel thing, my content didn't look anything like what it looks like now, you know, and my current content, which is plenty to get me to 200,000 subscribers, 17 million views, biggest working with huge brand partners. It's still not that fancy. I don't have a fancy editor adding in all sorts of bells and whistles either. It's still very basic and that's fine because it's very effective.

[00:24:15.590] - Tasha
So, the second tip that I have, which I will say is I actually feel like it's the most important thing. So, when you start making content, be purposeful about it and include a specific call to action in every single video that will drive people to do something that you want them to do. Right. Because people don't take action unless you specifically tell them to. They'll just say, "Okay, that was great. Now I'll move on to the next video", if you don't tell them what to do. And the thing with YouTube videos, unlike blog posts, you can never change them. Once they are out there, they're out there. And maybe you can change, say, the description box. But people may not read the description box if you don't even tell them there's something in the description box that you want them to see.

[00:25:02.480] - Tasha
So when you're making your videos, just think about, well, ultimately, what do I what's the purpose of this video? What do I want it to do for my my business, for my blog? What action do I want people to take to bring them closer into the fold of my business and my company and my brand? And make sure that you're putting that stuff in there from the very beginning because you're going to be upset if you start making the YouTube videos. And six months from now, your very first video takes off and it doesn't have a single call to action in it. So it serves no purpose whatsoever.

[00:25:38.120] - Liz
Yeah, and one call to action, though, ideally.

[00:25:40.520] - Tasha
Right.

[00:25:40.790] - Liz
If you give them multiple, they're going to choose none of them. I think last year we learned during one the YouTube sessions that you can actually have like a default description. And so I started using that and have CTA in there so, I never forget to type it or talking about it. So, it's another little quick tip.

[00:25:58.610] - Tasha
Yes.

[00:25:58.970] - Liz
Okay, awesome. Thank you. I think this is super helpful, especially for people that may be feeling a little intimidated at doing video. Done is better than perfect. Give it a go, be consistent. How long would you say you need to be consistent before you should kind of, you know, maybe decide that's not going to work out for you?

[00:26:15.800] - Tasha
So I don't believe that there's any such thing as it not working out for you. Right. With anything in business. It's like I think that people go to a thing they hear like, oh, videos. The next thing, because I'm sure, like, YouTube is very hot right now. I'm getting this vibe because, like, we have some opt-ins related to YouTube and those are getting more and more traction, even though I'm not doing anything with them because our YouTube course is not currently available for sale.

[00:26:44.420] - Tasha
And so I think that we all have this tendency in online marketing to hop on the next fancy thing. And so when people don't immediately gain traction on YouTube, they think, "Oh, well, this is never going to work." But a better question to ask is, what can I do here? Like where? Like troubleshoot, what's not working and why isn't it working? I think the only time that you should really consider scratching your YouTube channel is if you gave it a good go, like maybe six months to a year and you're still like and let's say six months and you're like, I hate video. Like I absolutely hate it, you know-

[00:27:25.400] - Liz
You don't like anything about it.

[00:27:25.510] - Tasha
There's nothing that I enjoy about this. And it is my strong preference to never be direct to camera. Even still, I would kind of push you a little bit and say we are that is where things are going. So, if you want an online business, then I strongly encourage you to go take a speaking class. Right? Like go to Toastmasters, go take a course on how to become a better speaker, on how to get comfortable in front of the camera so that you can do this. Because I do believe that having. The video will really help you grow your business and grow your website, because think about if someone pops on to a website, it's just words and sometimes it can be really hard for your personality to shine through in a single blog post, especially if it's a very- it's like a listicle, very utilitarian type of blog post. Whereas in a video they can't help but get to know your personality at least somewhat because they see your gestures and hear your voice.

[00:28:28.690] - Liz
Also puns going on.

[00:28:28.690] - Tasha
Exactly. And so it's it's how you start to build a relationship with someone. Like there is a reason why Match.com has added video chat to their process of connecting people, because video really does help build relationships and help you see if your- it helped them see if you're a good fit to help guide them on whatever it is that you want to help them with.
