If by day four, you don't know that, I'm not doing a very good job. But let's go ahead, and I'm going to have each of these wonderful people introduce themselves.

[00:01:02.950] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Jessie, why don't you go ahead and start?

[00:01:05.320] - Jessie Festa, Jessie on a Journey
Sure. Hey, everyone. My name is Jessie, and I run the Travel Blog, Jessie on a Journey, which is solo female travel, and then Epicuren Culture, which is sustainable travel and food and wine. Then from my years of travel blogging, I had so many people ask me how to do it that now I also write about travel blogging. I have a podcast, the Profitable Travel Blogger podcast, and a number of courses and on my site.

[00:01:32.250] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Fantastic. All right, Portia, do you want to go next?

[00:01:35.530] - Portia Wofford, the Write Nurse
Hey, everybody. My name is Portia. I am the founder of the PW Agency, and we are a content marketing agency, and we do content, mostly blogs for health and nursing platforms. I'm also a nurse by background, and I had a lot of nurses asking me, How did I get into freelance writing? I started a group, Nurses Who Write, and a brand, The Write Nurse, where I teach nurses and other health care professionals how to get into blogging.

[00:02:04.190] - Liz Stapleton, Host
That's fantastic. All right. Now, Dama? Yes.

[00:02:07.550] - Dama Jue, Thrivecart Template Shop
Hi, I'm Dama Jue, and I have two businesses or two brands within my business. Dama Jue, which is the site that I launched last year, which is all the things online business that helps you run your business more strategically. It's marketing angles, but also very, very tech-centric. How to make the tech that you're already paying for, do more for you. And then the other brand under my umbrella is Thrivecart Template Shop. I happen to love this software. I've been with them for a long time, and I do run a massive portion of my business through Thrivecart. It's templates, as is indicated in the name, but also courses, trainings, how to set up your affiliate program, all the nitty stuff where it's like, tech, but I show you how to do it in a very logical, strategic, simplified way. That gets the job done always with lots of bells and whistles, like Airtable templates and email templates and stuff like that.

[00:02:59.040] - Liz Stapleton, Host
That's fantastic. All All right. And Destini. Welcome back, by the way. I'm going to say Jessie and Portia, too. But yeah.

[00:03:06.200] - Dr. Destini Copp
My name is Destini Copp, and I own three different online brands. One is Hobby School, where we run regular online learning virtual I have digital summits on all types of different hobbies. I also have a Shopify store called Hello Content, where we have a lot of digital product templates and just things that you can use in your online business. And then my personal brand, which is Destini Copp, where I'm a digital product and sales funnel Consultant, where we help people basically build up their digital product businesses and make money selling digital products.

[00:03:38.010] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Fantastic. So we're going to go ahead and just dive straight into the questions. So the first question is, what are the primary income streams you currently rely on as a professional blogger, online business owner? Let's go ahead and go backwards, Destini, if you want to start, since this is a very individualized question, I'll just call it.

[00:03:55.170] - Dr. Destini Copp
Now I got to think about all my income streams. So definitely do affiliate marketing. I've been doing that. I actually started out doing affiliate marketing before I had any products. We have online courses, we have low cost digital products like journals, planners.

[00:04:09.870] - Liz Stapleton, Host
What's the number one revenue driver?

[00:04:12.650] - Dr. Destini Copp
The number one is my high ticket program, which is basically my one on one coaching program that I do. I would say that that is more time intensive, obviously, than the other ones. But so affiliate marketing, all over digital products, we have only courses, we have memberships, the low-cost digital products, and then my high-touch coaching program that I do. That's all my income streams.

[00:04:41.290] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Got it. And then the biggest driver is the high coach coaching.

[00:04:46.150] - Dama Jue, Thrivecart Template Shop
Yes.

[00:04:47.570] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Okay, Dama, you're next because I feel like yours is going to be more product-based, but I could be wrong.

[00:04:51.920] - Dama Jue, Thrivecart Template Shop
Yeah, it is. So my business is 60 % digital products, and I lump everything in courses, trainings, workshops, anything like that. And then 40 % now is affiliate income. And then of that courses, digital products portion, I don't do any one on one coaching. I don't do any done for you stuff. It's a lot of low ticket products ranging from nine to $2,500.

[00:05:18.300] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Nice. Okay.

[00:05:19.450] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Portia, I feel like yours is more service based.

[00:05:21.460] - Portia Wofford, the Write Nurse
So I feel.

[00:05:23.570] - Liz Stapleton, Host
We have a diverse group even.

[00:05:26.020] - Portia Wofford, the Write Nurse
Yeah, actually, mine is more service based. I I've gone into the consulting side on blogging. I'm very passionate about health equity and diversity and equity and inclusion. With AI, us as writers, we've known about AI. I think the general public is now just catching on to AI and what it can do. I'm on the consulting side making sure that my clients, if they're using AI, that the AI or the algorithms that they're using are not perpetuating biases or stereotypes. Just I'm looking over their AI generated content and saying, Hey, you can't say this, or, Hey, this is not... This is racist. This is perpetuating stereotype. Then I also have digital products. I've always done digital products, but the past year when I realized I said, Hey, I don't really want to write anymore, full-time. I wanted more passive income. We got into digital products. Of course, there are digital products to help other writers, digital products to help people with digital marketing. I think a lot of writers don't realize that digital marketing is trending right now, but we've been doing digital marketing. That's what we've been doing. A lot of us didn't call it digital marketing, but that's what we've been doing.

[00:06:40.490] - Portia Wofford, the Write Nurse
So me helping people understand what digital marketing is and digital marketing products, and then doing some done for you digital marketing products for other writers who wants to start selling digital products.

[00:06:51.560] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Fantastic. All right, Jessie. I'm curious because I know I feel like you crush affiliate marketing, but I know you have membership and stuff, too, and I don't know what What drives yours?

[00:07:01.550] - Jessie Festa, Jessie on a Journey
I'm an even split at the top for Mediavine, like display ads, affiliate marketing, and then products and services. I look at my income for digital products different. Then I also run, you might know this, I've run photo tours in New York City, so service. But I also have my blogging membership, my courses. Those are all at the top. And then secondary is working with brands and tours and boards, paid speaking, and I do some one-on-one itinerary planning.

[00:07:31.290] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Okay, that's awesome. All right. So next question is really, when you were starting out, what income stream did you focus on building? And then I would also love to know, how much did you build it before you started trying to build another stream, if that makes sense. Who wants to start?

[00:07:49.320] - Portia Wofford, the Write Nurse
I'll get them out.

[00:07:50.540] - Dama Jue, Thrivecart Template Shop
Oh, sorry, Portia, you go ahead.

[00:07:52.440] - Portia Wofford, the Write Nurse
I started with blogging, blogging for nursing and health brands, learning SEO blogging is mainly what I I did. And that was my main income stream for an entire year. I had done some digital products as a nurse, but I didn't really understand what digital products were at that time. So my main focus was just blogging. And then I realized, oh my gosh, I'm burnt out from writing 20, 50 posts per month. There has to be another way that I can make money. And I realized that I had a lot of clients. I could not meet all their needs. And so I basically went to other nurses who were interested in writing and said, I'll train you to be a writer if you come and write for my agency. So I created an agency of other nurses who were writers. And I was basically the content manager or the content director. And then from from there. So it was about a year. It was about a year when I pivoted into coaching. I don't like the word coaching, but mentoring other nurses into being writers. And I realized I could make an income stream from that as you teach other people how to be writers.

[00:09:00.080] - Liz Stapleton, Host
So you said your first focus was blogging, but how was that being monetized? You were trying to build up your SEO for display ads or for affiliate marketing. What was that first- So I was blogging.

[00:09:10.280] - Portia Wofford, the Write Nurse
I come in from the blogger side of actually blogging for other brands. So I didn't even think about creating my own blog. I didn't even think about that. So freelance writing for other brands. Yes.

[00:09:22.420] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Okay. I just wanted to really clarify that. Fantastic. All right. Dama, I think you wanted to go next. Yeah.

[00:09:28.790] - Dama Jue, Thrivecart Template Shop
I started as a service provider, so that was my primary income stream. And then I started building my affiliate income side of the business immediately. My coach was like, No, you don't. Just wait till you're... You're not going to make money with affiliate income to your bigger blah, blah, blah. And I was like, yeah, anyway, me scrolling to the footer of every website because I'm doing tech setups. I'm a technical person, so I'm doing tech setups. Of course, I recommend X. Let me use my link for the love. So I built my service provider I'm going to say an affiliate side by side from the jump, and digital products didn't come so much later. Interestingly, though, it took me a lot longer to get to six figures with... No, I'm going to strike that. It took me a long time to get to six figures in affiliate income. But it took very little time, not very little, but relatively little to a year and a half to get, or about a year to get to income. Just cut me out, girl. I can't talk.

[00:10:27.800] - Liz Stapleton, Host
That's a live. I can't do it. I'm sorry.

[00:10:30.140] - Dama Jue, Thrivecart Template Shop
I'm all tongue-tied. I don't know why, but it took a long time to make six figures in affiliate income. It did take a relatively long time to make that as a service provider.

[00:10:40.560] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Yeah.

[00:10:41.090] - Liz Stapleton, Host
No, I agree with that. Okay, Destini, Jessie, you want to add anything?

[00:10:45.050] - Dr. Destini Copp
I can talk about when I first started my business, I first started with blogging. When I started blogging, I went to go look for affiliate products that tied in to what I was writing about because I didn't have any products at the time. I've never really done service work, so I've never been in that. But I started with digital products almost immediately because I knew that's one of the reasons why I started my business, because I wanted to do online courses, because I had been teaching online as a university professor for like 15 years before I started my business and developing online courses. So I knew that's what I wanted to do because I just been familiar with it. So definitely affiliate marketing, but jumping right into digital products almost immediately.

[00:11:29.270] - Liz Stapleton, Host
All right.

[00:11:30.670] - Jessie Festa, Jessie on a Journey
When I started my blog, it was 2011. So honestly, there's so many more opportunities nowadays. But I knew when I was starting out, I wanted visibility right away. So I actually started freelance writing. Well, I grew my blog and I was writing for USA Today and CNN and all these big publications to, A, make money and B, get my name out there and grow my traffic. And I honestly don't know if I knew about affiliate income. I'm sure I did. But I was more focused on working with brands. I would say that if I started over, that would not be what I would do because it is, while it can be great money, it's a lot more time for money versus running ads, affiliate marketing, even digital products, because you can set up your sales funnels and they run in the back. What I did, I think starting with the freelance writing actually was really smart. It was very flexible and it made good money. But if I started again, I would focus on affiliate marketing before any working with brand stuff.

[00:12:25.260] - Liz Stapleton, Host
I like that. When I first started my blog, my aim was ads and affiliate marketing. I started building that. And then I pretty quickly, well, I say quickly, started in 2014, but I really started to figure out blogging in 2015. And I attended my first conference. And then I started freelance writing in that niche, which is what I feel like if you need to... You're going to get laid off or you're going to... You really need to quit your job. Offering a service is the fastest way to replace that income. And so when I got laid off in 2017, I was able to stay full-time self-employed because of my blog and having established the credibility as a freelance writer. And I wrote for like, NerdWallet and all these, you know. I don't remember. It's a long time. But yeah. So like, and then I phased out clients in 2021. So I started as a freelance writer. I ended up transitioning to Pinterest management. And I completely phased out clients, I think 2021, 2022, in there. And I've been solely digital product and ads and affiliate income, but primarily digital product-based. So just throwing out my experience as well.

[00:13:44.270] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Okay Are there any specific considerations or milestones you'd recommend achieving before diversifying your income streams?

[00:13:54.520] - Jessie Festa, Jessie on a Journey
I could start. I always say, I think you'll have an easier time with most when you have traffic. But I do think what's even more important is having that engaged audience. I think there's a few ways to build it, but I think for many of us, the email marketing works really great for really conversing with your audience, sending them amazing tips, nurturing them. Then you can actually listen to them. One thing I love about email is people actually respond to them and they ask questions about what you send. Then everything I've created, from my membership to my courses to my NYC photo tours, came from people asking me the same thing over and over Hey, I'm coming in New York City. Can you show me around? I'm like, Oh, there's something here I can create. So growing that audience, nurturing them, and then really listening to what they want from you.

[00:14:43.580] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Yes. You don't necessarily need a huge audience to be full-time self employed with an online business, guys, but you need an engaged one. It makes a big difference. When I was full-time self employed, freelancing, I didn't have a huge blog. It was maybe 10,000 sessions a month. It wasn't crazy. So just throwing that out there. Who else wants to talk about any milestones or anything that helped you recognize it was time to start diversifying?

[00:15:11.340] - Portia Wofford, the Write Nurse
I think I could just piggyback off of what Jessie said. I think having an engaged audience. And if you are a freelancer, so you are service-based, looking at the things that your clients are missing. So one of the things that my clients kept asking me because I am a nurse, they wanted to know, did I know to any other nurses who were influencers? And I had five clients ask me that, and I said, Well, I know tons of nurses. And if you guys are going to pay, I'm going to start offering this as a service as well. So we created an influencer agency for a specific for healthcare professionals because my clients kept asking me, Do you know any creators who could talk about whatever their product or service was? So listening to your clients on the freelance side and actually building a relationship with them. A lot clients would have webinars, and I would go in and sit because I would write blog posts, and I would say, This webinar was about X, Y, and Z, but you had no one from this community speaking on this panel. And then they were like, Well, can you help us with this?

[00:16:13.210] - Portia Wofford, the Write Nurse
And so those were ways I was able to go first by because I just listened to what they had. I saw the gaps and the things that they were trying to offer, and I was able to bring something to the table.

[00:16:23.840] - Dama Jue, Thrivecart Template Shop
I wanted to add a little something on to Jessie's in terms of having an engaged audience. I had a friend approach me at dinner party the other night and just say, I'm creating my first course. I was like, Okay, how's your audience growth going? Well, I have 27 followers on Instagram. I was like, Okay, do you have an email list? No. I was like, Okay. I want to say I appreciate wanting to monetize from the jump, but before you create that, building an audience and having a clear way that you can communicate with them directly, I can't emphasize email marketing enough. I'm I'm going to go a step further to say, put yourself on a routine before you start selling to folks. Can you email them once a month? And then can you work your way to twice a month? You don't have to email them every day or even weekly, but can they know who you are before you sell to them? Because sometimes people are like, yeah, I spoke in a summit. I have 400 subscribers. And then they just hit them with a sales page or something, with a sales email. And I'm like, you all got to let them know that you know what you're talking about and you're a person that's worth buying from.

[00:17:27.030] - Liz Stapleton, Host
So anyone who's like, wait, where do I start with email marketing? Go watch the Q&A I did with Liz Wilcox yesterday. That is still up because she is great for it, especially when you're just getting started, and she will help you build that habit, and you will learn a lot. Just throwing that out there. All right, Destini, did you want to add anything?

[00:17:43.180] - Dr. Destini Copp
Yeah, as I was thinking through everything I mean, obviously, I completely agree with everything that everybody said, Jessie and Dama, about the email marketing. I would say that it's been one of the biggest drivers in business growth for me is really focusing on email marketing. Just to take it a little step further, and I agree with doing it on a regular basis, building that muscle. But you also need to constantly drive those new leads into your business, those new email subscribers. So that could be through visibility efforts that you're doing. It could be just through blog traffic, right? If you continue to grow that blog traffic. Now, that's not how I grow my email list, but certainly that is a strategy. You could do it through guest podcasting, speaking at virtual summit. So there's a lot of ways that you can continue to grow that email list, but especially if you're going to be selling digital products. Now, if you're a service provider, a freelancer, you don't have to worry about that as much. But if you're going to diversify and move into other income streams, that's something you're going to want to focus on eventually.

[00:18:50.750] - Dr. Destini Copp
Yeah.

[00:18:51.190] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Okay. Next question, I want to ask it. I'm going a little off-script here, guys. I'm sorry. But what are some mistakes you've made when trying to balance different income streams, because I definitely like when I picked up freelance writing, my affiliate and I had income like that, that started to drop, right? Because I wasn't focused on it as much. So how do you balance that? What lessons have you learned in trying and failing or trying and succeeding. I feel like you learn a lot more from failing than you do succeeding. But if anyone wants to hop in on that.

[00:19:26.110] - Dama Jue, Thrivecart Template Shop
I can share something. My very first digital product I created while I was still doing done for you work, but in an industry or in a niche I wanted to pivot out of. I don't know why I didn't think about this, but if you create a course, you need to stay current on that content. I was like, I'll just create a course and then back on up and go do something else. I did not think that through. It did really well. I was like, Wow, I just had my first $5,000 launch, and I feel like, Oh, this is so great. Then the questions never... People wanted to and ask questions and follow up and did, Did you see this latest update? It was based on Pinterest. It's like, Well, this algorithm shift happened, and I was just like, Oh, I don't want to talk about this anymore. I made the mistake of thinking that if I'm going to create a product on this, then it's the last word I'm ever going to say. I regret that. That was a painful realization where I was like, damn, I just looped myself. I basically yoked myself into this for a lot longer than I wanted, at least a year, because I just sold people on this.

[00:20:30.420] - Dama Jue, Thrivecart Template Shop
I thought I was just going to be like, Here's the offloading of my knowledge. Bye. And it was.

[00:20:37.350] - Jessie Festa, Jessie on a Journey
I think, too, I've run into that as well. Now I focus mainly on my membership, and I have some printables. I have some courses, too, but I've definitely been in that boat where it's like, Oh, my gosh, this one thing changed. Now I have to update everything. But I love creating repeatable workflows where it's like, okay, when I launched my membership, it's like, Oh, my gosh, there's so much to do. But now that I've been doing it a while, Okay, Fridays I do this. I have one week in my planner, one week a month where it's like, get everything ready for the next month. And then when I add on another revenue stream, I'll create the repeatable strategy for that and make them work together. I also like to do check-ins where I write out yearly, quarterly, monthly, weekly, daily tasks. And then I really think, Okay, what can I get rid of? What can I combine? And then what could I outsource? Is there something that like, You know what? This is taking a lot of my time and I would be better useful doing something else. Maybe I can... I have writers, I have a VA, I have an accountant.

[00:21:36.070] - Jessie Festa, Jessie on a Journey
Absolutely. So I find those things really helpful.

[00:21:40.520] - Liz Stapleton, Host
I love that.

[00:21:42.040] - Dr. Destini Copp
And I just wanted to jump in and say, if you try something out and you're like, I absolutely hate that. I don't want to do it. It's okay to stop. And I'll just give you an example. I mentioned that I don't do service work, but I did it for a hot minute a few years ago. I was a Facebook Ads Consultant. Really, honestly, really good at it, but I did it for a couple of clients, not very long. And I basically said, You know what? This is not for me. I don't want to do this anymore. And I got out of that business really quickly.

[00:22:11.320] - Portia Wofford, the Write Nurse
I don't think I have to ask just making sure that you're solid in the first income stream before you start to move on or pivot into the next. I think sometimes we get discouraged and this is not working, so I'm going to go over here and do this. One, you're going to confuse your audience if you're building an audience. And two, may confuse yourself. So just make sure that you're solid in that first income stream before you start to pivot into the next one.

[00:22:38.220] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Yeah, no, I like that. I think it's really important. If you are spreading yourself all across, you're never going to get very far on any one thing. So I like that. Okay, let's dive into some specifics. What are mistakes like new bloggers or really any bloggers, should avoid when it comes to affiliate marketing and trying to build that into their income strategy?

[00:23:02.710] - Jessie Festa, Jessie on a Journey
I could start.

[00:23:04.110] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Yeah, why don't you start?

[00:23:04.900] - Jessie Festa, Jessie on a Journey
I think the biggest mistake is sprinkling links into your posts when people weren't looking for them. So I'm in travel. If I'm writing a guide to traveling solo in Italy and I share an affiliate link to the luggage I used, sure, you might have some people click and buy because they're travelers, but no one came to that post looking for luggage. They came looking for tips for Italy. But if you think about something called buyer intent keywords, where you're attracting people looking to make a purchase, such as affordable hotels in New York City or best walking tours in Paris, you're going to have a lot more conversions because people were looking to make a purchase. So if buyer intent keywords are confusing, you could honestly Google it, and there's posts with huge lists of what they are, but they are keywords you can optimize your content for that attracts people actually looking to make a purchase. Liz, you're muted.

[00:24:07.210] - Liz Stapleton, Host
This is why I normally just don't even try to mute, unmute, because I will always get to mute, but my dog was barking, and I had to kick it out. No, I was just saying I was definitely guilty of sprinkling links in here and there in my early days. And I'm sure some of my old blog posts still have them. Anyone else want to add to just affiliate marketing, things you wish you knew, stuff that has helped?

[00:24:33.640] - Dr. Destini Copp
One thing I'll just jump in and say is, obviously you can include affiliate links in your blog post, but there's a lot of other places you can include them. Like if you're selling digital products, you can include them in the course that you have, especially obviously if it relates to the content and maybe it's a tool that they can use to accomplish that transformation. So I would think out of the box and be a little bit creative about all the different places that you can include your affiliate links that people would come across your content and click on them.

[00:25:05.370] - Liz Stapleton, Host
I'm going to let you talk, Portia. But just from a legal standpoint, check your affiliate, the program's terms and conditions to make sure they allow that. Just throwing that out there. All right, sorry. Portia, go ahead.

[00:25:15.950] - Portia Wofford, the Write Nurse
I'm going to say I agree with that. Even if you're on the services-based side, the freelance side, and you decide that you're going to pivot into different stream of income. For an example, if you want to pivot into coaching other freelance writers, what are the products that you're using in your business? Reach out to those brands and see if they have affiliate programs. Then also, I think a lot of freelancers don't think we can do affiliate marketing if we don't have a blog. But what I learned is that the brand that you build around yourself, you can potentially do affiliate marketing. My brand is around being a nurse who writes, so a lot of companies that want to market to nurses reach out to me and want to know if I wanted to be an affiliate for their brand. It makes sense for me because my brand is still around being a writer and also being a nurse. So it's not like I'm just throwing out links because a lot of nurses follow me. So that does make sense as a freelance writer to market those products as an affiliate for them. And then definitely if you're going to pivot into different income streams, look at what products or services that you're already using, and see if they have affiliate links.

[00:26:24.620] - Liz Stapleton, Host
I like that. Dama, you want to add? I mean, 40% of your revenue is affiliate income, right?

[00:26:29.800] - Dama Jue, Thrivecart Template Shop
Well, I think there's some really good points covered. I would say one thing that is a real elementary thing that I see, we're talking about affiliate income mistakes, proper disclosure.

[00:26:41.890] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Yes.

[00:26:42.460] - Dama Jue, Thrivecart Template Shop
Say proper disclosure. Disclose your affiliate links. I see people doing stuff all the time where I'm just like, okay, I'm not the FTC mind your business, mind your business, but also like, okay.

[00:26:53.760] - Liz Stapleton, Host
If you need help with that, guys, I have an affiliate disclosures made easy course that's nine bucks. So rolling that out there. I'm at elizabethstapleson. Com, where I help on the legal side of things. So, yeah, no, you're right. I know these bloggers are making big bucks, and I'm like, that's not disclose properly.

[00:27:14.540] - Jessie Festa, Jessie on a Journey
So even celebrities, I can't believe how many huge celebrities I see that are clearly promoting affiliate products that I'm like, you have millions of people looking at this.

[00:27:24.790] - Liz Stapleton, Host
I'm not surprised. I feel like that is like, that's not surprising to me, almost, because I feel like that's not their main business. Yeah, they make money, but their agent's like, hey, you've got this deal, do this. And they're not telling them they need to disclose or whatever. I mean, clearly, I know how celebrities work. Okay, let's let's move on to another income stream. I'm going to talk about how do you approach securing sponsors or sponsored content or sponsored relationships, brand partnerships? What are you considering before you decide to collaborate with a brand?

[00:28:07.190] - Jessie Festa, Jessie on a Journey
I could start.

[00:28:08.210] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Yeah, go right ahead. I don't do a lot of sponsorship, so.

[00:28:12.560] - Jessie Festa, Jessie on a Journey
This might sound obvious, but a lot of brands will try to work with you for a trade basis, and maybe you're okay with that. But personally, and if you're new to collabs, you'll see soon, these take a lot of time, not even just the creating of the content, but the contract, going back and forth. Getting signed up as a vendor on their website sometimes takes over an hour in itself. So just consider that you're going to put a lot of time into this. So make sure that you are compensated. And then, of course, it aligns with your audience. If you're new and you're like, Oh, I don't have a lot of traffic or followers. How can I work with brands? Think about your audience because audience alignment can be the thing that gets you noticed. If a brand is like, it's a yoga brand and you have a yoga audience, you could say, Hey, my audience is small, but it's 100 % the people you want to get in front of. Those are some of my thoughts.

[00:29:10.490] - Liz Stapleton, Host
And you can go back and forth on your contracts, guys. You don't have to take the first offer.

[00:29:14.840] - Jessie Festa, Jessie on a Journey
Because They will put stuff.

[00:29:15.600] - Dama Jue, Thrivecart Template Shop
That's my point. Everything's negotiable. Yeah. When you're in the negotiating phase, it's all negotiable.

[00:29:21.560] - Liz Stapleton, Host
And have a contract. Like, those are things that people overlook. They don't do a contract or they just take whatever is given to them and don't read it. Read your contract, guys. Yeah.

[00:29:30.640] - Jessie Festa, Jessie on a Journey
One thing that I've noticed in contracts a lot that I've always made them take out is we get access to all your photos on travel. So it's like I'm usually going on a trip or something and they want my whole camera roll. Even if you have zero followers, your photos are worth money. So never give photos for free, especially commercial licensed photos.

[00:29:48.710] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Oh, I like that. All right. Anyone else want to add something? I know, Portia, you already talked about working with brands a little bit, but you want to dive a little deeper?

[00:29:57.650] - Portia Wofford, the Write Nurse
Yeah. So I think, of course, I don't think I'm a little different from the rest of you ladies because I mainly focus on providing services through my blogging. But building that personal brand is so important. Brands reach out to me all the time to do deals with them. One of the things I've really been interested in this year is user-generated content. You don't have to have a big following to do user-generated content. If you can create good content, you take that content, whether it's photos, whether it's videos, and they You use that content for their social media or their website. Again, I highly suggest that you look at the contract, make sure that you're getting paid for your usage, make sure they don't own any of your videos or your photos. If they want to use it in ad, paid media, they're paying you for that as well. If you don't have a large following, but you do create really good content in blogging, you can use your blogging as a deliverable for that. Blogging is big right now. Companies If you want to have blogs for their website, and if you want to write about the product that you use or the service that you use, you can do blogging as user-generated content as well.

[00:31:09.420] - Liz Stapleton, Host
That's fantastic. Anyone else want to add anything? No? Okay. All right, we'll move on. How can bloggers determine the right products to create based on their niche? We talked a little bit about listening to your audience, but when you don't have a big audience, or they're introverted audience? They're engaged, but they're not going to speak up. Do you have any suggestions on figuring out what might be a good fit?

[00:31:39.870] - Portia Wofford, the Write Nurse
I just asked my audience. I've asked them before. I love to do polls on Instagram. I love to do... And I have a big audience on Facebook as well. People sleep on Facebook, but I'm an older millennial, so I still have an audience on Facebook as well. I ask them what they want. Also, companies come to me with stethoscopes and things like that. Most of my audience, even though they're nurses, they're not interested in that, they are interested in services like resume services. And so things like that to help them progress in their career. I ask them, Hey, what do you guys like? What do you need for your career? What do you need if you want to go into entrepreneurship? I ask them. I love to do polls. And it also increases your engagement as well if you're using your social media audience as a way to get these brand deals or sponsorships.

[00:32:29.820] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Okay. Oh, did we lose somebody? Oh, we're back. Sorry. Okay. Sorry, Destini, look like you want to say something.

[00:32:36.340] - Dr. Destini Copp
Yeah, I was just going to say one of the things we've done in Hobby School, we've combined email marketing with our Facebook groups. We have a decent size Facebook group for Hobby School. So we'll put a post in there with questions or a poll, and then we'll send out an email, drive people to the Facebook group to get them to answer it there, or just to respond back to the email. So some people respond back to the email, but a lot of people, they like to go to that Facebook group post and give us their comments there. So it is just really asking. And I would say in my B2B audience, they're a little bit more close to the chest. And what I've done in those situations is to invite them on a Zoom call with me and giving them $100 Amazon gift card. And that would instead... I typically at least get 10 people to have that conversation with me. So that worked in that situation.

[00:33:30.660] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Yeah, and I think a lot of people do use an incentive. If you're trying to get someone to fill in a survey, that's where you can be like, if you fill this in, you'll be entered to win something, right? So maybe you don't have $100 to give to five different people to jump on a Zoom call, but maybe you could do a $50 Amazon gift card as a giveaway for someone who completes a survey. So that's a similar idea there. I may or may not be doing something for that for the summit afterwards.

[00:34:04.730] - Dama Jue, Thrivecart Template Shop
One thing I'll say is I definitely believe in polling your audience either on social. I trust the polls on social a tiny bit less than I do the ones on email because the people in my email are my ride or dies, I feel like. Anyway.

[00:34:21.090] - Liz Stapleton, Host
They're your people.

[00:34:22.470] - Dama Jue, Thrivecart Template Shop
Yeah. So I do do polls. I do that as well. And I do giveaways and stuff like that just to get to incentivize them to give me their feedback. But one other thing that I do is I look at what people are asking for. I don't have any done for you work, but I do have one-on-one 60-minute paid strategy sessions or tech strategy sessions or just what are you stuck on? Let's get you unstuck. It's really just whatever you want in this hour. You've got it. You've got access to my whole brain and my strategy. I pay attention to what people are asking me in that. Where are they getting stuck? Where do I not have a training or an offer for? I might create something around that. Then the other side of it, because I do teach marketing, a lot of people pay attention to the way I motivate my affiliates and then the way I sell my products, the way I market my stuff. Then And this doesn't sound pretty to say, but I pay attention to what people are copying. I'm like, Oh, you're copying this. Let me go ahead and get paid to teach my strategy.

[00:35:22.680] - Dama Jue, Thrivecart Template Shop
I'm going to make a workshop on this, share my results, share my strategy, share how I do it in a template because I'm I'm big on helping you make it easy. So 2022 was the year I got copied a whole lot. And I'm just like, oh, so you like this?

[00:35:37.610] - Liz Stapleton, Host
And 2023 was the year you created a whole lot.

[00:35:41.720] - Dama Jue, Thrivecart Template Shop
I'm like, okay, enough people have literally copy and pasted this. It's time to get this monetized. Let me actually share it so you can copy it on the up and up instead of doing it on the shady shady.

[00:35:53.220] - Liz Stapleton, Host
I like it.

[00:35:54.930] - Portia Wofford, the Write Nurse
Love it.

[00:35:56.730] - Jessie Festa, Jessie on a Journey
I would add you could look at what content is well. In your Google Analytics, if you're a blogger, you can look at the topics people are actually coming to you for. You can also do things to get a sense of what people will pay for. So things like hosting webinars. If you're going to launch a big course, maybe you host some smaller workshops on that topic to see if people are interested. You could do an opt-in freebie to see what topics people are opting into. But I think the best way to make sure is to pre-sell. If you have something you could actually presell, and say, Hey, you have this until this day to buy it, and then I'll be teaching the first module live on this date in two weeks, you can actually make sure that people are signing up before you make the workshop that you're going to teach. So Those are some other tips.

[00:36:46.510] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Yeah. No, that's actually what I did with the Blogger Breakthrough Summit Membership. I was like, I've been running this. This is all still really good content. And so I pre-sold and I was like, Can I get enough people to sign up to make it worth my time to get this set up as a a minimum viable product. And I'm in the process now of making it, beautifying it, and doing all the things. But yeah, so pre-sell. It's huge. Unless people are going to open up their wallets Saying like, Oh, I'll give you free access for feedback. That's a whole different thing. That's not guaranteeing it's going to sell. So yeah, I love that explanation. Okay, moving on. I would love to know what metrics you guys are using to evaluate the success your efforts? What metrics are you looking at to see if affiliate marketing is working or if your product is working or whatever the case may be? What metrics are you guys paying attention to in your business?

[00:37:44.270] - Jessie Festa, Jessie on a Journey
I look at income, but I try to track. I mean, each one I track pretty differently. For sales, I have some way of seeing... I'm sure everyone has their funnel set up somewhat similar, but at the checkout, it's like you can do the... What do you call it? The cart upsell, or they can do the checkout after paying. For each thing, I have some type of code attached, and then I have a spreadsheet. I have the funnel laid out in the spreadsheet, and then it's the numbers. Who bought here? Who bought here? Who Bought Here? Who Bought Here? I even looked at my opt-ins. For example, I just did this because it's January now. I was like, Wow, I have so many different opt-in freebies. My evergreen webinars convert light years better than It's like having that information is great because now I'm going to focus on promoting those more than maybe some of my printables and quizzes that I offer. Just having some way to know actually where people are clicking. With affiliate marketing, there's so many tools. Affilimate is a great one, but it is pricey. A good free one is Microsoft Clarity.

[00:38:50.360] - Jessie Festa, Jessie on a Journey
That's what I use. You can actually see where people are clicking in your posts. Then many programs also allowed you to add code to your tracking link. You can see, okay, Hey, these people bought from this post. I use Viator, I'm in travel. Viator is amazing. I can add the exact code. And then when I look at that code in Viator, it'll say, Okay, you made 10 sales this month from links with that code. Those are some of the ways I track, specifically affiliates and the funnels themselves.

[00:39:19.320] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Okay. I like that. Anyone else want to share some metrics that you do to really keep an eye on things and know the pulse of your business? Dama?

[00:39:32.940] - Dr. Destini Copp
I can jump in.

[00:39:35.580] - Liz Stapleton, Host
I'm seeing nodding heads, no one's speaking up.

[00:39:38.900] - Dr. Destini Copp
Very similar to what Jessie said. So we have different funnels that we track throughout all the businesses. So for instance, in Hobby School, we're running a monetize your craft summit right now. It's actually going on right now. So we'll look at the landing page registration version and then the entire funnel. How did the tripwire do? Which is How did the VIP pass. How did the order do? How did the upsells do? After the summit, we'll continue to go. We're doing an affiliate offer. So we're promoting something from Marie Forleo for these folks. And then after that, we're even going to have one of our own offers in February, a membership that we're going to be promoting. So we'll track all of that for this specific audience.

[00:40:21.980] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Okay, I like that.

[00:40:24.350] - Dama Jue, Thrivecart Template Shop
I agree with all that. For funnels and stuff, I look at the stats right inside ThriveCart. My upsells, my bumps, what bump is converting? Is it a number that I'm comfortable with or is it converting too low? It takes no time to swap out a bump. It'll take me 10 minutes or an upsell. I mean, it takes about 12 seconds to swap out an upsell in ThriveCart. I love that. If I feel like it's converting well enough, if it's not, okay. In terms of sales, I look at that. Then in terms of my business, on a broad scale, I track all my sources of income, including affiliate. I track everything in Airtable, and I take a look at that quarterly and see which categories of my offers are selling better, which categories of things are starting to decrease. I look at year over year and quarter over quarter, and that's what helps, frankly, decide, It's time to create a group program. You know what? I'm going to throw another low-ticket thing out there. It just depends. I look at that stuff quarterly, and then I also track all my metrics for growth, quarterly and So email, my open rates, my click to open rate ratios.

[00:41:34.590] - Dama Jue, Thrivecart Template Shop
I'm nerdy. I mean, I'm a former accountant, so I really care about data trends and that stuff. So I look at that. And then the other thing that I'll say about all of this is despite all of that, sometimes your gut just overrides it all. So sometimes it's like the data is telling me I better go create a webinar and sell a high-ticket offer. And it's like, And yet I shall not. I don't And yet I'm not going to. I literally just had this conversation internally and my friend is like, no, you really should do a webinar. And I was like, but no, everyone's doing something in January. No. Anywho, moving on. I'm going to go screw around with something else.

[00:42:14.070] - Liz Stapleton, Host
That's where you get to. It's your business. You get to decide. I love it.

[00:42:17.730] - Dama Jue, Thrivecart Template Shop
I like to know that I'm looking at the numbers, but also I like to be like, yes, but I'm in charge. So no, we're not doing a webinar right now.

[00:42:24.920] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Yes, I like it. Do you guys do a lot of A/B testing at all or is it something you try something, see what works, and then try something else? Are you doing any split testing?

[00:42:36.600] - Dama Jue, Thrivecart Template Shop
I do on landing pages individually. So I like to do forms with drop-downs because I can segment on the drop-down form. I get them segmented exactly where I want them, and then it spirals into different funnels. But depending on how things are going, sometimes people don't want to click that drop-down. So I A/B test that stuff, but I don't A/B test my sales pages that often. Anyone else?

[00:43:03.530] - Jessie Festa, Jessie on a Journey
I will test different offers. I have similar funnels, so sometimes I'll test different offers within... I mean, one funnel, I'll do this, one funnel, I'll do that, and then I'll look. But I haven't really done it in the same funnel, probably mainly because of the tech, I'm like, How would I really... I don't know. To me, that sounds really challenging in the same funnel, but I'm sure there are ways to do it.

[00:43:25.930] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Probably you can learn from Dama. She's the tech.

[00:43:30.320] - Dama Jue, Thrivecart Template Shop
I'm like, It depends on your tech, but probably I can show you how to do it. It doesn't take that long. But then I'm just like, sometimes I'm bratty, and I'm like, yeah, that's telling me I need to change stuff. But I need to scroll over here and go create a new thing. All right.

[00:43:46.530] - Liz Stapleton, Host
What are steps you guys take when you're like, something's not working, to optimize it or to fix it? How do you recognize something's not working? And then what are the first few steps you take to try to rectify it?

[00:43:59.890] - Portia Wofford, the Write Nurse
I I think I recognize something is not working. There's just no traffic or the engagement is not what my average engagement is because I do a lot of my funnel building on top of my funnel. I do a lot of engagement on just social media. I mean, that's what I do, that's what I use. And if my audience is not resonating with it, I know something is off. Even when I try to switch things up. I love to do storytelling. I love to talk make my captions in the form of a narrative story, and my audience resonates with that. But then when I'm trying to be super formal and super informative, they don't really resonate with that as well. And so I'll just switch it up. And then also When people stop asking me to things like this, like you asking me to do the Blogger Breakthrough Summit or people asking me to come on their podcast and talk about a subject. If I'm not getting people asking me to come and do guest speaker slots, it lets me know that my audience is I'm not really into that. That's just something that my audience doesn't like, they're not engaged with, and that's not what they know me for.

[00:45:06.380] - Portia Wofford, the Write Nurse
Then every now and then, every quarter or so, I ask them, Hey, I have the idea to do this. I want to switch it up. Is that what you guys are here for? They'll say, flat out, say, No, we don't want you to talk about that. We're not here. That's not why I followed you. I followed you because I wanted to get tips on how to create content. I didn't follow you because I'm gotten really into reworking furniture, and I wanted to start talking about that more about platform. They're like, No, we didn't follow you for that. We don't want to see that. But what you can do is while you're repainting some furniture, reworking some furniture, you can do a voiceover and tell us something about content while you're doing that. So I started doing things like that to mesh my interest in with what they follow me for.

[00:45:45.070] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Yeah. And sometimes you just have to start a second blog.

[00:45:48.350] - Portia Wofford, the Write Nurse
Right. That's what I'm in the process of doing now.

[00:45:51.800] - Liz Stapleton, Host
But guys, be careful because it's a slippery slope, says the girl with four.

[00:45:57.280] - Dama Jue, Thrivecart Template Shop
That's what I'm saying. I can say something really quickly from the tech perspective. Sometimes it's just a design thing. If you have a really square-looking section in your sales page and people are trying to click it and it's not a button, so sometimes it's just UI, UX stuff. I like Hotjar or true conversion. Sometimes, especially, specifically when I'm launched, and I don't do this all the time, but when I've got a summit open or when I've got a bundle or when I've got a sales page and I've done the big web, I pulled my big girl pants on and did the webinar, I will look at how are interacting with the sales page. Where are they clicking? Are they toggling the FAQs? Which ones are they lingering on? All that stuff.

[00:46:37.700] - Liz Stapleton, Host
I like that. All right. Anyone else want to add anything?

[00:46:41.830] - Jessie Festa, Jessie on a Journey
I could add something. I'd say if it's a product thing, say a funnel, I would look at exactly where in the funnel the issue is occurring. A lot of my bloggers in my membership are new and they're like, Nobody's clicking my app and I have to make a new one. And then we look and it's like, Well, you're getting no traffic to the opt-in, so no one's seeing it to know that. I feel like looking at where the issue is and then troubleshooting there is super helpful. Because we're talking about blogging, I can talk about traffic, specifically. Traffic is great for affiliate marketing and products. If I create content that I thought would do super well and didn't, sometimes I'll realize, Oh, I don't have enough content about this topic to create this content pillar around it. So how I troubleshoot that is I'll create more content about that topic that I can interlink and really grow that topical authority. So it depends on what the issue is. But specifically for traffic, if you're like, Why is my article not ranking? I really thought that would do great. Maybe you just don't have enough content on that specific topic and you need to create more content on that.

[00:47:50.590] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Yeah, I like that.

[00:47:51.520] - Portia Wofford, the Write Nurse
I love that.

[00:47:53.560] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Yeah, Portia's from the content marketing.

[00:47:55.120] - Liz Stapleton, Host
She's like, yeah .

[00:47:58.680] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Okay. All All right. I think this might be the last question. No, maybe we have two questions. Okay, next question. Have you experienced earning plateaus, and how did you overcome them?

[00:48:10.960] - Portia Wofford, the Write Nurse
Oh, wow. Yeah, I definitely did. 2022, going to 2023 was a very rough year for me. But what I realized is that I was mentally burnt out and exhausted, and it was reflecting in my work. And so what I did was I just took time away. I told clients, I'm taking time away, refer them to other writers who I trust, which was a great thing for me because I'm now a network of writers and we can refer each other clients. And I just took time to get myself mentally back to where I needed to be. And when I came back, now I'm like, fresh, I'm ready, I have new ideas. But that entire time that I was taking time off from writing, I was still educating myself. So I was still staying on top of best practices. I was still reading. I was still making sure that I stayed in the loop. I really I dove into learning AI because writers were panicking and bloggers were panicking. Oh, my gosh, AI is going to take over. He's not going to take our job. I was like, Look, it's not going to take over. You have to just learn everything you can about it so that you can show your clients why it's better.

[00:49:14.990] - Portia Wofford, the Write Nurse
Yeah, you can use AI, but guess what? You need a writer or a blogger to look over that to make sure that you optimize it. For me, it was a mental block. I think I had a writer's block for almost a year, but it was a mental block for me. Luckily, I had my streams of income to hold me over. That's what I did. Just took some time off for myself, and then I took that time to educate myself, and then in a turn, educate my audience.

[00:49:43.110] - Jessie Festa, Jessie on a Journey
I'm in travel, so definitely 2020, when nobody was looking up travel anymore, was a pretty devastating time. It was like, straight down. But my membership still did pretty well, I think, because a lot of people wanted that community aspect, and we were meeting on call. I've never had so many people show up to live calls than 2020. But one thing I did, because nobody really wanted to know how to travel solo in Italy or New York or anything, was I created a whole travel from home content pillar on my site that still to this day brings in so much traffic. I created all these short story roundups. I created how to volunteer from home, how to do an at-home yoga retreat. But the story roundups were great because I would work with other bloggers, and I'd do like, Tell me your best finding love on the road story. Short, and I put 20 stories in there, and people just love reading that stuff, even today. So thinking about, Where is my audience now? They are not traveling, but they miss travel, so how can I bring it to them? And that allowed me to still...

[00:50:47.420] - Jessie Festa, Jessie on a Journey
I was certainly not making what I did make through Mediavine before COVID, but it still allowed me to make money.

[00:50:53.180] - Liz Stapleton, Host
That's awesome. Destini, Dama, you want to add anything? No. That's okay.

[00:51:02.700] - Dama Jue, Thrivecart Template Shop
I can't tell if I'm in an income plateau or if I'm just... Anyway, don't mind me. I'll just move by the way. I'm just thinking.

[00:51:13.240] - Liz Stapleton, Host
All right, one last question, then we're going to wrap it up. How do you balance managing multiple income streams without compromising the quality of your content or overwhelming your audience? And I would add, or overwhelming yourself? Let's kick it off.

[00:51:28.890] - Dama Jue, Thrivecart Template Shop
I can start Because I primarily have two income streams, digital products and affiliate marketing, they can go in two different directions or you can mend them, you can meld them seamlessly. Basically, if you don't have this thing that I'm talking about, because I do a lot of affiliate marketing for tech, so I'm like, If you don't have it, let me show you what it can do. And then if you do have it, let me show you how to make the most of it. So I really have both sides of the coin, and I think that's been a big part of for it. But I think the other thing in terms of just not overwhelming your audience is I always give people the opportunity to opt out of any promotion. If I'm going to be hammering, if I'm sending more than one email about anything, click here to opt out, click here to not hear from me until Black Friday, click here to not hear from me until December first or whatever it is, or if you're not interested in X, just click here to opt out. I'd rather people opt out than unsubscribed because just because this offer isn't for them, doesn't mean that they're not going to have something else.

I'm getting I'm careful to not overwhelm them. I'm also not a person who does daily emails unless I'm in a launch, and I know that people get stressed out with that. So if I'm going to do it, go ahead and opt out. That's cool.

[00:52:41.210] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Yeah, I like that Destini, you're about to.

[00:52:47.060] - Dr. Destini Copp
I'll just jump in because as you were reading that question, I was like, You know what? I think I've somewhat mastered this to some extent. It took me a while. It took me many years to do this. But a lot of this, I just weave it in through to various content. Like my podcast, that's where I weave in my coaching stuff. Then I bring in my podcast content to my email newsletter, and in my email newsletter, and sometimes a podcast, too, I'll bring in some of that affiliate stuff or the digital products and just So it's just various places in the newsletter. I'll sprinkle it in, and then that brings them to the courses. I'll have some affiliate stuff and offers in there or to different courses or affiliate programs. So it's just really cohesively looking at your business and all the different ways that you're building content and distributing content, whether it's on social media, email, podcasting, blogging, whatever, just naturally talking about it. And I think that's the best way to position it.

[00:53:46.600] - Jessie Festa, Jessie on a Journey
Yeah. I think if you pad it with a lot of value, if I'm sharing, I don't know, I have a course on landing press trips. In my launch emails, I'll say three tips for landing press trips, and I'll actually give people tips. But then I'll say, if you want actual, behind the scenes of how this works, here's this. So even if they don't purchase, they're still getting those tips and they're not like, Oh, this is just so salesy all the time.

[00:54:10.820] - Liz Stapleton, Host
I like that. I also think what you mentioned earlier, Jessie, about you develop your workflows. And then you don't start adding something else until you've really nailed one down and you know when you're going to do it and how that's going to work. I think that's a huge thing. That's something I've really worked on in the last year is getting my back in organized and systemized and automated where I can because that's going to allow me to focus my attention and not be trying to do 17 different things at once.

[00:54:38.750] - Jessie Festa, Jessie on a Journey
I split my month up into four weeks, and it's like, your weeks will look different. But I have a content creation week, like an outreach, getting membership stuff done. But one of the weeks is promo planning, and I was going to show you're in here. It's like what I'm doing for that month, the big focus, I try to pick one or two things so that it's not 10 promotions a month. It's like, Okay, I'm doing this this month. And then I can also look at how things go together and I'm not overwhelming people with the same thing over and over. I can spread it out how I want. But just even having this is like a gross piece of scrap paper. It just is like a little key that I use for my planner. Like, Okay, it's promo planning week. What do I have now for February? I want to work on the content for that.

[00:55:24.090] - Liz Stapleton, Host
That's awesome. Yeah, I remember you actually... I like to see that you're still doing that because I think last year or the year before the session you did for the summit, it was how you do your outreach collaboration, which is in the summit membership, guys. But it's still the same piece of paper that you just... Yeah, you got to find what works for you. It doesn't have to be overly complicated. It could just be a piece of paper. I think Amanda Warfield does that, too. It's just a piece of paper.

[00:55:51.780] - Jessie Festa, Jessie on a Journey
I'm all on paper. I mean, I'm still using... This is my calendar. So when people are like, Are you free? I'm like, Let me go look when I get home. I'm on my paper calendar.

[00:56:00.390] - Liz Stapleton, Host
I like it. Anyone else want to add anything?

[00:56:04.740] - Portia Wofford, the Write Nurse
I'm all about calendar. I love my Google calendar. I sync my calendar with my son's calendar. Everyone's calendar is synced. So then it's color-coded inside of my phone so that I can figure out what I need to be doing on what day. Also, when you get to the point to where you can bring on some help or outsource some of the things, I have a VA or a virtual assistant who we work really well together, and I've been teaching her how to write, so she's been able to write some things as well. Also, planning content. I love AI. I love using AI to plan my social media posts and captions and doing things like that. A lot of writers are afraid of AI, but once you learn it and once you learn how to train it and you bring that blogger eye, your blogger expertise, and you figure out how to rewrite those things so that it matches your voice and your tone, it's helped me tremendously with social media content. Now, when it comes to my blogging, I still have to write it 100%. I can't give that up quite yet, but it does also help to understand how AI does write blog posts because you can use that as another income stream because you can actually train other bloggers or companies on how they can use AI.

[00:57:21.760] - Portia Wofford, the Write Nurse
I love it for creating calendars. I love it for creating captions and just rewriting things. I actually had someone to tell me they use ChatGPT, and they said, Write this in Portia's voice, and they sent it over to me. I was like, Oh, my gosh. Wow. You guys can use AI. Don't be afraid of it. Use it for your benefit.

[00:57:43.890] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Yes, but definitely edit it because if you're not editing and making it your own, you don't have copyright.

[00:57:47.250] - Portia Wofford, the Write Nurse
Definitely edit it. Definitely fact check.

[00:57:49.840] - Liz Stapleton, Host
But you won't own the copyright. If you really use what AI spits out, people can steal it and you can't do anything about it. Sorry, I'm always coming in with the legal perspective.

[00:58:01.200] - Portia Wofford, the Write Nurse
We need that.

[00:58:03.850] - Dama Jue, Thrivecart Template Shop
I'm going to add one more thing that I thought of, if it's okay. Just along with what Portia was talking about with her Google calendar, I create... You can have multiple calendars linked in your Google. I have one that is like summits and bundles. When I say I'm going to do a thing, usually they're asking me like six months in advance. I think, I don't remember when you asked me Liz to do this, but I put it in that thing and it's like a certain color on my calendar. I know I'm sending a dedicated email during that time or I'm going to show up live or I'm going to do whatever it is I promise to do because otherwise it gets very easy to forget your commitments. And then that results in me feeling overwhelmed Oh, my God, I'm in three things. So it gets a little overwhelming.

[00:58:42.670] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Yeah, and ClickUp, I've got a collaboration list. And within the task, I put any links to like, this is my promo requirements. This is where I'm going to find my affiliate links and swipes and stuff. Anyway. Okay, we got to wrap this up, though, really quickly, if you guys want to, and we'll go in reverse this time, just share where people can look learn more about you, what you would like them to do to connect with you. We can kick it off with Destini.

[00:59:05.280] - Dr. Destini Copp
Well, on social media, I'm on Instagram, Destini Copp, LinkedIn too. Linkedin is probably my best platform or the one I'm on the most. And of course, my website. Destinicopp.com. Super easy. All right.

[00:59:18.260] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Portia.

[00:59:19.580] - Portia Wofford, the Write Nurse
I'm on Instagram at thewritenurse. It's W-R-I-T-E, thewritenurse.com You can find me on LinkedIn as well. But Instagram is probably my favorite platform. And then also you can find me on Facebook, Portia Wofford.

[00:59:34.060] - Liz Stapleton, Host
All right. Dama.

[00:59:35.670] - Dama Jue, Thrivecart Template Shop
My primary Instagram handle is @Damajue, D-A-M-A-J-U-E. That's where I hang out. I also have a ThriveCart template one, but it's abandoned. And get on my email as because that's where I spill all my tea, all the secrets, all the actual numbers of my business and revenue and all that stuff.

[00:59:54.650] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Fantastic. Jessie.

[00:59:55.860] - Jessie Festa, Jessie on a Journey
And I am Jessie on a journey. Jessie's with an I-E. That's all my handles on social. Instagram is the best social. But you go to my website and you just click blogging, you'll see all the freebies, the podcast, all that. And like Dama, I am sharing most of my best tips on email.

[01:00:12.220] - Liz Stapleton, Host
Yes. And if below this video on the page, you should see information about them and learn more. It should take you to their speaker page, which should have their social and things and website. So if you're like, I'm typing it in, I'm not finding it, you can just click through the sites. But yeah. So thank you guys so much. I really appreciate it. I'm sure everyone watching did too, and everyone watching the replay. And with that, I'm going to go ahead and say goodbye to our audience. Bye, everyone.
