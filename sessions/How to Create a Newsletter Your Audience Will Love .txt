Hey, everyone. Welcome. I'm so excited that you're here. I'm excited to be back. This is my second year presenting. My name is Trevann from your writing bestie. Today, I'm going to teach you how to create a newsletter that your audience will love. Here's what you can expect. First, I'm going to talk a little bit about myself. Then, I'm going to have a quick chat about newsletters. Then, we're going to talk about how to create an awesome newsletter, how to up your newsletter game, and how I can support you. Get your pen and paper or whatever you take notes on out, and let's get started. Hi, again. I'm Trevann, the founder of Your Writing Bestie, a content marketing and copywriting company that helps women service providers, usually in the marketing and health niche, generate leads and sales. One of the ways I do that is by creating and writing newsletters. My clients and your writing bestie enjoy open rates of 20 to 50% for newsletters and other emails. I currently run two newsletters for Your Writing Bestie. I might be doing a third this year. The first one is the your writing bestie newsletter, where I share bite-size writing and SEO tips.

[00:01:35.440] - Trevann Hamilton
The second one is Freelance Writing Stories, where I share tips with early career freelance writers to help them navigate the freelance world. I published The Your Writing Bestie Newsletter on LinkedIn and Kit, and it blew up on LinkedIn. I have over 12,000 subscribers and received a newsletter sponsor in 2024. They managed to sponsor a couple months, and for me, that was amazing. Does anyone here already have a newsletter? If you do, let me know in the chat. If you don't, you're probably wondering, do I even need a newsletter? Here are some reasons I think that you may need a newsletter. First one, if you want to connect with and nurture your audience, you probably want to get a newsletter. If you want You want to establish another income stream, you might want to get a newsletter. Remember, with a newsletter, you can get a sponsor, you can put ads in, you can promote your products and services, there is affiliate marketing, there's so much you can do. You may want more website traffic. You can actually lead your subscribers to your website or blog and therefore increase your traffic. If you want to build your email list, a newsletter is a great way to do that.

[00:02:59.180] - Trevann Hamilton
A newsletter If it's just one type of email, but maybe you want to send sales emails later, you'll already have a list, so that will increase your chances of getting sales. Here are a few key stats that you might want to know about. 81% of B2B marketers choose newsletters as their preferred form of content marketing. 31% of marketers use email newsletters as a main channel to nurture leads, and 95% Gen Z, millennials and Gen X get newsletters. If you're wondering about boomers, I believe it's around 84%, something like that. If you want to create an awesome newsletter, it's time. The first thing I would suggest is to write down your goals. Before you do anything in your business, ensure you have clear goals, and creating a newsletter is no exception. I recommend the SMART method. Smart stands for a specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time bound. For example, I want to increase traffic to my blog by 30% in six months using my monthly newsletter. That's an example of a smart goal. Next, I would say create a budget. That's not because newsletters are expensive or anything like that. You can actually start a newsletter with exactly zero dollars and zero cents.

[00:04:29.970] - Trevann Hamilton
But you might want to invest in it soon, now or later. Here are some things you can consider paying for. An email writer and marketer. They can help you to nurture and sell to your email list. You may want to pay for an email marketing platform. Many of them do have free plans, but maybe they don't suit you, or you just want to dive in and start paying right away. You can also pay for a social media marketer that can help you get newsletters signups from your social media platforms. Next, I would recommend researching email marketing platforms. There are many out there, and it can be a little overwhelming, but just focus on your goals and your budget. Here are some things you might want to consider. The cost. So if you're just starting out or on a tight budget, consider using one with a free plan. The types of emails you want to send. There are some that are better for more visual emails like MailerLite and the ease of use. You have to be the one to decide if you like that email marketing platform, if you can use it easily. You are the person who is running your email marketing services.

[00:05:56.310] - Trevann Hamilton
If neither of you like the platform, then it's probably not going to work. So this is the most important step. The audience comes first, and your newsletter is actually supposed to serve them. So ask your audience what they want. If you want your newsletter to make your audience excited to open your emails monthly or weekly, then you need their input. You can do that by asking them directly, Hey, I'm creating a newsletter. What do you want to see in it? It sets up interviews, or you can read about your audience on sites like Reddit or Quora. You check them out to see what your target audience is talking about, what problems they're having, what questions they're asking. That is a great way to help you make and design an email newsletter that serves the purpose you need it to serve, which is your audience. They come first. I can't state that enough. Next, peek at your competitor. You should definitely avoid copying them, but you can look at what they're doing and see how you can improve it. So I recommend checking out their newsletter sign-up strategies, checking out exactly what they're writing about, and figuring out their strengths and weaknesses.

[00:07:26.530] - Trevann Hamilton
Next, and this is my favorite part, creating an outline. While your newsletter outline can change over time, coming up with a basic outline can save you so much time and energy when you sit down to write it. So I recommend writing down headings and sections that you know your audience will care about, paying attention to your layout, and saving your outline as a template so that you have it later on. So let's look at an example. Meet Anna, someone that I completely made up. She's a personal finance blogger who helps Gen Z women manage their money, earn more, and thrive. She also makes YouTube videos on these personal finance topics. Anna offers coaching services for people who need help with their budget and sell digital products. Her budget for email marketing is $150 per month. She has two main goals, which is to increase sales and traffic. She has evergreen products and a coaching program, so she wants to sell those to her audience. And so her goal is to increase her sales by 20% within six months. And she wants to increase traffic to her website by 15% within six months. Here's an example of a newsletter outline that I would suggest.

[00:08:53.680] - Trevann Hamilton
It wouldn't be written in this format. It would probably be written in a Google Doc, but I thought this looked pretty. So This is why I did it like this. The first thing I would say is probably to add a header. You definitely don't have to do that. But let's say you named the newsletter Anna's Personal Finance Tips or something like that. Let's say for the first month, we're talking about credit card debt. You could put that in the header or you can keep it the same all the time where you just have the name of the newsletter or your blog's logo or your picture, anything like that. Then I would suggest having a section where there's just a quick chat and update where you say, Hey, first name. Of course, the email marketing platform will put in the correct name and you'd say, Okay, here's what's going on in my life. Here's how this topic relates to you, or this is the topic that we're going to go over. Before I continue, whenever you're adding personalizations, make sure you hit the Preview so you can see if it's actually going to put in the person's first name because maybe you've gotten emails that it actually says, Hey, first name.

[00:10:22.320] - Trevann Hamilton
So you don't want that. Anyways, the next section would be a tip or a story. Either give a quick tip or include a story about a mistake that you made and how you fixed it. So if we're going off the credit card debt theme, maybe Anna was in credit card debt, and she's going to share one method that helped her get out of it. Next, you would include resources. You could include a blog, products that you have, digital products that you have that could help the reader get out of credit card debt, a YouTube video that spoke about that same thing, anything like that. And then a concluding section. You don't have to write a words conclusion. You can just continue writing. You can say, Hey, this is what the next newsletter is going to be about. You can ask them a question, or you could just leave some closing remarks. Now it's time to set a schedule. Many entrepreneurs often start newsletters and stop them soon after. Consistency is key. I know you've heard that many times, but it's true. One of the best ways to stay consistent is to set a schedule and stick to it.

[00:11:41.130] - Trevann Hamilton
I recommend just creating a schedule that works for you. If you can't do weekly newsletters, that's okay. Do it bi-monthly, do it monthly. Then tell people when to expect your newsletter. I find that helps you to stay accountable. My newsletters are monthly, and I constantly post about that. It makes me feel as if I really do have to put out a newsletter monthly because I don't want to disappoint anyone. You can adjust your schedule anytime. I recommend letting them know that, Hey, The weekly newsletter isn't working out for me. I'm switching to monthly. I'm switching to bi-monthly. Now it's time to send it. And if it's your first newsletter, it might be a little scary. Well, if I'm being honest, it's always a little scary to send off a newsletter. You might be wondering, Is this one great? Did I make a mistake? There are so many things that will run through your mind, and that's normal. Read it over for errors. Make sure you personalize it. There's a lot of debate.

[00:12:51.410] - Trevann Hamilton
There is a lot of debate about whether or not you should add someone's name to an email. Personally, I love doing that. Just don't overdo I open emails when I see my name in the subject line, let me know if that's the same for you. A lot of other people like it. I mean, it really depends on you and your audience. You can try it out and see how your audience reacts it, but personally, I think it's fine. And finally, you should craft an irresistible subject line because it would suck to write a great newsletter, but the subject line isn't great, and then less people open it. Here's just a summary of all that I just said. Next, let's get into the bestie method. This is the bestie method for newsletter success. It is so simple. Trust me. The first thing is to be consistent. You don't want to ignore your email list for long periods of time. That will hurt your relationship with your list and your sales. You want to engage with your list. Of course, your subscribers want to feel valued and heard, so make sure you engage with them. I recommend a welcome sequence in place to engage and nurture them right off the bat.

[00:14:15.770] - Trevann Hamilton
I would say that you should encourage them to hit reply with questions. Sometimes I'll ask my subscribers, Hey, what do you guys want to see in the next newsletter? Or what's something that you're really struggling with right now? And then I'll use that in subsequent newsletters so that they're getting what they need. I would then say you should schedule your newsletters in advance. Scheduling them in advance will help you to stay consistent, motivated, and free of your time. You can take a look at your analytics. They will tell you a lot. I pay attention to the open rate and the links that the subscribers are clicking. Next, invest in your newsletter, whether that means investing in your skill, the email platform, writers, whatever it is. You'll have to invest in it. Next, and finally, earn from your newsletter. You can earn from your newsletter by getting sponsorship, ads, affiliate marketing links, promoting your products and services. The list goes on. You may have some newsletter challenges such as cost. You may think you don't have the budget for a newsletter, but again, you can start with no money. The time, maybe you don't have the time to create newsletters.

[00:15:45.460] - Trevann Hamilton
One thing you can do is create a schedule. So for Your Writing Bestie and for my clients, at the top of the year from January to December, and I actually write what the theme of the newsletter will be. That helps me to stay consistent, and it saves me a lot of time. Next, you might be worried about your skill. Can you write an email? I know that blogging and email writing are two different things. I started out as a blogger, so I get it. You might be worried about your return on investment. You may feel like it's not worth the investment or it's taking too long for you to see the return. That's fair. It's the long game. It takes a while to build up a list. That's okay if you're having these challenges and fears. But here's how I can support you. We can create an amazing newsletter. Whether you have an existing newsletter or want to start from scratch, I'm ready to help you create the newsletter that you need. So if you want to nurture your list, generate leads and sales, repurpose your blog posts, or get more eyes on your blog, you can get a free 15 minute consultation so we can figure out what exactly it is that you need.
