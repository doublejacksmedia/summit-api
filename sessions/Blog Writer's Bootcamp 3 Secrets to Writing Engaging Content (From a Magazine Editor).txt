[00:00:13.430] - Marlene
Hello, everyone. I am so excited to be here today as part of the Blogger Breakthrough Summit to give you a little blog writer's bootcamp. This workshop is going to share with you three secrets to writing engaging content. So, you can up level your writing skills. Now, today, we're going to go over three major things that you can expect to learn. The first is the biggest mistake that I see a lot of beginning bloggers make.

[00:00:42.530] - Marlene
Some of you may be familiar with that, some of you may not. The second is why your blog posts are not getting read and how to fix that because we're not going to spend the time writing these posts if nobody's going to read them, right, unless is one of the secrets to writing engaging content online.

[00:01:01.890] - Marlene
Now, if you are wondering if this is for you, I will just go quickly through who this is exactly for. This is probably for you. If you are a small business owner or a blogger/content creator who struggles with consistency. I have found personally that with my clients, consistency is probably one of the biggest hurdles and the biggest things they struggle with. Maybe you feel like you've got a message to share with the world, but you don't exactly feel super confident in your writing skills. Or maybe you just want to learn how to grow a brand of loyal and engaged clients and readers because it's not all about the numbers, right?

[00:01:41.460] - Marlene
Like we want an engaged audience, engaged clients, engaged readers because that's what truly makes a difference. Now, if you are wondering, who the heck am I to be teaching you about writing, I figured I'd do a quick little introduction. So, my name is Marlene and I am a former magazine editor turned content creator and online entrepreneur. I have worked in the magazine industry for nearly 15 years and was the editor in chief of four magazines of four, launching my own fashion and lifestyle blog and a copywriting business too.

[00:02:15.120] - Marlene
So, I typically work with lifestyle brands to help them stand out using their voice online, with content coaching and with copywriting too. And as I mentioned, I also have a personal fashion and lifestyle blog that I started on the side. So, throughout my career, I've added and written like literally hundreds and hundreds of articles from BBC Travel to Phoenix Magazine at Modern Luxury to Scottsdale every day with Rachel Roy, like seriously, so many. I always just kind of knew that I wanted to be a magazine editor and wanted to go into the publishing industry.

[00:02:51.130] - Marlene
So that's what I did straight out of College and things kind of changed at some point. I think it was about ten, maybe 15 years ago, the industry totally shifted and just like that, blogs were born and everything started moving online. And I'm not really one to not roll with the punches and adapt to, I went online too. And honestly, I had a pretty strong journalistic background I definitely had the experience.

[00:03:19.560] - Marlene
I should have been primed for success, but I wasn't. And to be honest, my fashion blog kind of sucked, and you think of my connections, and you would think that knowing how the PR world works and knowing how to write a great story, that I would have hit the ground running and been super successful right away. But I just wasn't. That's not how that story was. I kind of just tried doing everything under the sun and that included writing about everything.

[00:03:50.960] - Marlene
So, I just write about fashion. I had recipes, I had home decor, I had a little bit of all of it. I tried doing things like Friday five and creating thin content because I saw that working for other people where they had beautiful photography and two to three lines of text. I did not have beautiful photography, and it just wasn't getting me anywhere. This is probably the most embarrassing one.

[00:04:14.830] - Marlene
I actually tried to make my blog bilingual. At some point. I was writing posts half in English with Spanish underneath, because again, I saw somebody else doing it and it was working for them, and I thought, why not?  And you know I really honestly got stuck in the cycle of just copying what everyone else was doing and not staying true to who I was. Then I was like, enough is enough.

[00:04:39.670] - Marlene
I found my voice and everything changed. After that, things started to grow pretty quickly. And I started being able to consistently land paid partnerships with brands while under 10K. I was a pretty small creator, and I was still getting paid partnerships with major household names like Wayfair, Sachs, Olay, Huggies and many, many more. And it's been an absolutely incredible journey. And I've asked what it is with brand managers. I always ask for feedback, and the number one thing that they've always told me is that they love the quality of my content.

[00:05:16.410] - Marlene
So, something I want you to take away today is that high quality storytelling and high quality images really are the keys to success. And you know you can do this even with a small brand, it's more than just the perfect feed. With the right words, you can grow your audience. What does that translate into?

[00:05:37.790] - Marlene
And why do we want this? Well, you want a more engaged and loyal following of customers and fans. If you're a creator, you're going to get more brand deals, aka, more money in your pocket and increased visibility for your blog and your business as you continue to grow in a way that helps you stand out from the crowd. Now I'm just curious where you are, how confident do you feel in your writing skills? Drop your answers in the chat.

[00:06:04.080] - Marlene
I'm curious to know. Are you more like one to three? Not so much. Are you semi confident? Are you like, I've got this?

[00:06:12.960] - Marlene
I know exactly what I'm doing.

[00:06:17.590] - Marlene
If you're on the lower end, I just want to bust a myth for right here, you might be thinking writing is an art and it cannot be learned. And to an extent, I can see why people think writing is an art. But to be honest, writing is a craft and with the right frameworks, teachings and techniques in place, anybody can learn. So, as we dive into the workshop, I hope that you shut down your distractions and can be fully present as that is how you're going to get the most out of this and be sure to stick around until the end.

[00:06:50.060] - Marlene
I do have a bonus that is totally free and is made just for attendees.

[00:06:56.530] - Marlene
So, the first secret to writing engaging content secret number one is to make sure you solve somebody's problems. Make sure that your content is about them, and it's not about you. Content is the core of all blogs. It's not the design of your website. It's not who your website host is. It's not how fast it is.

[00:07:17.740] - Marlene
It's not the perfect Instagram feed and the filter and the logo and all this stuff. It's content, you guys, it comes back to your content. I mean, by definition, a blog is a written piece of content online, and somehow we all stopped focusing on the actual writing and started prioritizing everything else. And this is something I'm really just personally passionate about because I feel so many people just going in circles about their site speed and their logos and finding the perfect fonts instead of focusing on the actual writing.

[00:07:51.190] - Marlene
A blog is a medium to tell a story, to share your content.

[00:07:55.350] - Marlene
And here's a fact. It's competitive. I mean the average blog post today has over 1200 words. That's 53% more than the average blog post six years ago. I know this because I used to get so much traffic to my blog and I could throw up 150 words in a post and I'd get traffic, and now it's obviously nowhere near that.

[00:08:16.630] - Marlene
But this also means you need to know two really important things. The first is how to put together a compelling post, and the second is that it's not enough to have a lot of words. They have to be good ones. They can't be fluff, right? You can't just write 500 words and then just stuff the rest until you reach the 1200.

[00:08:36.160] - Marlene
It's got to be good. So, if you want your blogging efforts to pay off and I'm sure you do, because that's why you're here, then you really need to prioritize and produce amazing content. And one way to do that is to make it about them and not about you. I see this in particular with beginning bloggers is that you focus a little bit too much on your own likes and experience, and instead you need to focus on someone else's problem. That is one of the easiest ways to turn around your writing. And you can screenshot this, or you can write this in your workbook or whatever you have handy, but I'm going to repeat it again.

[00:09:13.660] - Marlene
The easiest way that you can do it become better is to make it about them and not you. And one simple way to do this is to reframe your post in the publishing world. We just call this choosing another angle of your story. So if you're sitting here right now thinking, oh my God, all my posts are about me, not them. Don't panic.

[00:09:32.900] - Marlene
I'm going to show you a really quick solution. Reframe the angle of your story. Let's say you have a story that my favorite summer reads. You can reframe this to ten must read books for that summer vacation. Honestly, the contents of this post are probably identical.

[00:09:51.490] - Marlene
The only thing that changed is that the title here is a little bit more focused on them versus you. This is also better for your SEO for your Google search because no one is going to go into Google and type what your favorite summer reads are, but they are probably going to look for great books to take on a summer vacation, and that's an opportunity for your blog post to come up. Another example is if you have an article that you're writing on my clean beauty favorites. Again, unless you're a very successful influencer when you have a huge following, a lot of people are probably not going to care what your clean beauty favorites are. But you can write the exact same post and tweak the angle of it and tweak the headline and make it the five best clean mascara options, according to Beauty Bloggers.

[00:10:39.110] - Marlene
Now, this title is incredibly clear. It's succinct.

[00:10:42.410] - Marlene
I know exactly what I'm going to get. Not only is it clean beauty, it's clean mascara options, and five of the best. That's super specific, very important in titles, which spoiler alert we're talking about soon. And it also has a modifier at the end of the title, according to Beauty Bloggers. Now, adding that gives us a certain amount of clout and expertise that you know that you're going to find in the post and you haven't even clicked on it yet.

[00:11:11.570] - Marlene
So, the second secret to getting engagement content, which you probably guessed we're going to talk about is getting the click. We're going to talk about two things here and that's great headlines and structure and how these are the tools to success. Great headlines are not made by accident. These are very very intentional. And if you can't get the click, your blog post won't be read period.

[00:11:40.570] - Marlene
End of story. Harsh truth, you guys. If you can't get the click, if you don't spend the time working on your headline, it doesn't matter if this is the most epic piece of content you've ever written. It doesn't matter if this is like a Pulitzer Prize winning thing. If no one clicks on your article, no one's going to read it and it starts with your headline.

[00:12:01.670] - Marlene
I'd love to know how much time you spend on your headline if you want to drop it in the chat. I don't know if you knew this, but a lot of experts recommend up to 50% of the time it took to write your story to write your headline. So, this is a small workshop, but I do want you to walk away with a couple of tips on how to work on excellent headlines for you to consider. They should always be clear and compelling.

[00:12:28.190] - Marlene
They also are strong when they evoke an emotional response, and this can be any kind of emotional response. This might be a headline that makes you feel happy and excited. It might make you angry. It might make you sad. It might make you scared.

[00:12:41.350] - Marlene
But next time you're browsing the Internet, think about how headline makes you feel and how that gut reaction made you click or not click. The last one element of an excellent headline is invoking curiosity. It makes readers want to click to read more. The only thing you want to be careful of is being vague because you can invoke curiosity, but you can still be clear and compelling. So, here's a couple of examples, because when it comes to headlines, it really is best to see by example.

[00:13:13.150] - Marlene
This headline is quirky clever, but it's so vague. One potato, two potatoes, three potatoes, four. I have no idea what this post is about. If I land on this person's website and I see it, I'm not going to click on it because I don't know what it's going to be about, and you have to be able to somewhat promise the reader this is what you're going to get if you click on the story.

[00:13:38.850] - Marlene
Here's an example of a truly excellent headline that's clear. It's compelling and it makes me curious. 38 Most Popular Egg Recipes for morning, noon and night. So, someone else may have titled this egg recipes. And yes, I would know I'm getting egg recipes, but this tells me I'm getting egg recipes that I can make in the morning for lunch and even late night.

[00:14:03.200] - Marlene
Okay. Not only am I getting egg recipes, but I'm getting 38. And I'm not just getting 38, I'm getting 38 of the most popular egg recipes. Well, these egg recipes must be amazing if they're the most popular, and that makes me curious. So I'm going to click on and read that post.

[00:14:23.230] - Marlene
Here's another example. This is kind of like the previous one where you could have just named it egg Recipes. This one is just named Personal Makeup Lessons. Yes, I have an idea what it's about. It's about personal makeup lessons.

[00:14:35.780] - Marlene
I don't feel excited about it, and it doesn't invoke curiosity. So, what I did is I just copied the word the keyword, which is probably personal makeup lessons for this person's blog, and I pasted it into Google. And these are two that stood out to me. Wired makeup classes have gone virtual, and we tried one out. Well, I know it's about makeup classes. That's clear.

[00:14:58.430] - Marlene
We tried one out, that makes me curious. I'm compelled to click on the post and see what was your experience like. The next one is also it's a totally different angle, but it's very straightforward. Private online makeup lessons, how to apply makeup. Again, it's really compelling.

[00:15:16.720] - Marlene
If I'm wanting to learn how to apply makeup, it's very clear and very specific. And you can see how both of these headlines kind of have a different angle, even though they are about the same thing. So, again, this is something that you can screenshot or write in your workbook. A couple of kind of title templates that you can use that tend to be successful. How to and ways to titles are always compelling.

[00:15:45.950] - Marlene
Including a number is an excellent idea as well. I always recommend including a number when you can, especially an odd number. Those tend to be the most attractive to readers. The ultimate guide to tends to be really strong, but please do not use these unless it's actually an ultimate guide. Don't use an ultimate guide to post if it's going to be 500 words, because that is definitely not an ultimate guide.

[00:16:10.690] - Marlene
How to blank so that blank. These are super fun and you can insert almost anything into this formula. And again, inciting curiosity. So, here's an example I just made up like these five clean hacks are the ultimate time saver. Wait until you see number three.

[00:16:29.870] - Marlene
Okay, what's number three? I want to know what cleaning hacks are. I want to save time. Five cleaning hacks. You see how it's all packed in there.

[00:16:39.010] - Marlene
You should definitely be spending a fair amount of time working on your headlines. And to be honest, a lot of the people I talk to and a lot of my clients let me know if this is you in the chat. They do their headlines as an afterthought, like the last thing they do. You're so tired after writing this huge post that you just want to get it published. And so, you just throw anything up there and I urge you to take a step back from your post, work on it the next day and sit down and brainstorm headlines.

[00:17:09.430] - Marlene
So, what happens after you get the click? Well, you've got to get them to keep reading. One way, of course, is with a great introduction and another is to make sure you have a well structured post. So, I wanted to briefly touch on what structure is and to just be mindful of it when you're writing. When I'm talking about structure, I mean, your outline, your backbone, any piece of writing needs this or your content will fall flat.

[00:17:36.430] - Marlene
We use structure in literally anything we write. Books have structure to them. An email is going to be different than a blog post, and a blog post is going to be different than a landing page or like even an about page on your website, and each blog post has a different structure, too. A tutorial or a recipe post isn't structured the same as, like a roundup or a list style post. So, my point was structure and to pay attention to it is that you've got to make sure that your content is structured in a way that fits the actual content that you're creating and has to have a clear beginning, middle and end.

[00:18:15.370] - Marlene
So, why does this matter? Again, knowing what type of content you're creating and how to structure it for readability and shareability is one of the easiest ways to improve your writing skills. And that's just because blog posts tend to be structured a certain way, so they're more readable, easy to digest, and easy to share with others. So, your action item and your takeaway is one, of course, work on your headlines, prioritize your headlines, and next time you sit down to write, start with an outline. I know that it doesn't sound fun, and a lot of people get on headlines.

[00:18:52.610] - Marlene
No, I hate outlines. But I promise this will make such a difference in your writing, especially if you're just starting out or wanting to improve.

[00:19:01.630] - Marlene
And once it becomes ingrained, you no longer have to do this. But honestly, some of the greatest writers still start with an outline. So, on to secret number three already. The third secret to writing engaging content is to make them binge. You want to create content that's so good, they cannot stop. Here's why?

[00:19:25.070] - Marlene
There's 600 million blogs on the internet right now. So, how are you going to stand out? You've got to create bingeworthy content, content that people cannot get enough of. That means, as we talked about, it's content that's well written, and it's well-structured, content that's thorough and content that captivates others and features a unique voice.

[00:19:52.230] - Marlene
And this is something that I talk a lot about with my clients as well is that it's an excellent way to stand out. Here's why. When you think of brands you love, what is it you fall in love with? A lot of it is probably their voice. It's the branding, it's the visuals, it's the tone, it's the whole package deal. The truth is, people fall for people.

[00:20:16.400] - Marlene
You've got to create content that makes readers fall in love with you and your brand. Personality fueled copy is the number one things that the clients actually request from me, and it's because they know they're going to help. It's going to help them stand out. And it's an online world full of noise. Jeff, who has this luxury camera bag brand, said whoever visits our site gets an immediate impression of what our brand stands for, thanks to the combination of fantastic imagery and playful, energetic copy.

[00:20:48.040] - Marlene
Again, she wanted people to have a certain feeling when they came to their site. And it doesn't matter if you're a content creator or if you're a small business owner, it's something just to keep in mind. It's like, how do you want people to feel when they come to your website? And how can you make them feel that way through your words, through your copy? If you want to grow and engage a loyal audience, you have to create content that people connect to us.

[00:21:13.250] - Marlene
So, here are a couple of ways that we can do that. Your content should contain storytelling techniques were relevant. I'm not saying pour your life story into every blog post. I'm not saying it should be all over your website, but just some storytelling elements are absolutely vital, especially in your blog writing. Your content should infuse some personality whenever it can and sound like a human actually wrote it.

[00:21:40.980] - Marlene
And I know that this last bit can be very difficult for a lot of people. Readers crave a connection, and that means copy that sounds human. Like I said, share part of your story if you want to, if you can sprinkle it in because these are the things that make you more relatable. And I want you to ditch any kind of jargon and industry speak and anything that you're doing to make you sound professional. I actually want you to just erase what you learned in high school English and that habit of going to thesaurus and finding a word that sounded smarter than in another word.

[00:22:18.140] - Marlene
No, it doesn't make you sound smarter. It just makes you sound stuffy. And at the end of the day, that's not what we want. We want to be relatable. You can inspire others and educate while still sounding like yourself.

[00:22:32.010] - Marlene
And you can still be an authority in your space while sounding like yourself. I want to reiterate that last one again because it's very important. A lot of people feel that they have to explain their authority with, like I said, like jargon and stuffy sounding words and stiff copy. And that's not the case. You can still be relatable.

[00:22:52.540] - Marlene
You can still speak in an everyday manner. And when I say speak, I mean, right, what you're writing online. You can still do this in an everyday manner and still be an expert in your field. So, here's what I want you to do and take away from this last exercise. I want you to try embracing a more casual conversational writing style to connect with your audience.

[00:23:18.610] - Marlene
So, just a quick recap, prioritizing our content is at the heart of growing our blogs and businesses, and all the content is made up of good structure, great writing, and click worthy headlines. And in order to engage with our audience, we need to write in a way that speaks to them. Now, I know you showed up today because you want to know how to upload your writing skills and you want to feel confident with the message you're putting out in the world. And you're probably also passionate about what you do and want to create an authentic connection with your audience.

[00:23:52.750] - Marlene
Now, I'm not that special.

[00:23:54.480] - Marlene
I was in the industry for so many years and it still took me a long time to figure it out. And even some of my earlier work that I thought was great when I graduated, it's still kind of cringeworthy at the end of the day. Writing is a craft. It doesn't happen overnight. That being said, I know you don't have 10/15 years to make it happen.

[00:24:14.690] - Marlene
