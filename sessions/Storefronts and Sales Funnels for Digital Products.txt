Hi. Welcome. I'm so excited you're here today to chat all about storefronts and sales funnels for digital products. Today's presentation will focus on the difference between storefronts and sales funnels for digital products and why you need both in your business.

[00:00:26.200] - Monica
They serve two different purposes, but both are very important. So, you may not know me yet, so let me introduce myself. My name is Monica Froese, and I run two websites. The first is Redefining Mom, which is a site dedicated to helping moms find their identity outside of motherhood. And the second is Empowered Business, where I help small businesses create profitable digital product businesses.

[00:00:48.990] - Monica
I've launched over 100 of my own digital products since 2016, and I've helped thousands of people do the same. Needless to say, I've learned a few things over the years, and I hope I can show you the power of using both a storefront and a sales funnel in your business. So, first, let's break down the most fundamental difference between a sales funnel and a shop. A sales funnel is a hyper specific buying journey meant to attract a cold, otherwise new audience to you. And a shop gives us a cohesive shopping experience, which is great for a warm audience. When someone is new to you, you don't want to confuse them by offering them too many options.

[00:01:34.050] - Monica
Plus, you need to educate them at the same time. So, a sales funnel is a great way to do this. In a shop, there are a lot of marketing triggers to entice you to add more to your cart and get you to spend more. But if they don't know who the heck you are, if they just land on your storefront and don't know anything about you or your brand, it can be a tough sell. Plus, there are many options in a store, so they can click around a lot.

[00:01:57.660] - Monica
And it's not a hyper-specific journey per se like a sales funnel is. So in a sales funnel, you make the choice easy. They have a specific problem, and you are offering them a specific solution. They either take it or they don't. So, let's break this down a little bit further.

[00:02:15.530] - Monica
This is my illustration of what a sales funnel is. It is an upside down triangle, and all a sales funnel really means is the customer journey. So when you think about acquiring a new or cold customer, somebody who doesn't know you yet in your business, it's easiest to think of it in terms of a funnel. At each step of the funnel, you lose people. So not everyone is going to take the next step in the funnel process.

[00:02:38.880] - Monica
That's why it's an upside down triangle. And it's also important why you want to have a super dialed in buying journey when the person doesn't know you. You don't want to give them too many choices, because if you give them too many choices, you will lose them. You confuse, you'll lose. So, at the top, when people come into your funnel, when they find you, the goal is at the very end, they're going to be buying the thing that you're offering.

[00:03:03.140] - Monica
In the digital product world, a digital product is simply a solution to their problem. So, they have now searched the solution, searched for a solution, they have a problem. They've searched for the solution, they found your digital product and they bought it. And that is what a sales funnel is designed to do. So, it will look generally something like this.

[00:03:24.390] - Monica
There's a free opt in. And then on the back end of the free opt in is a paid product, a tripwire, also known as a limited-time offer with an order bump. Sometimes there will also be an upsell that comes after that for something like a membership. And then after that, they'll get a follow up nurturing email from you. Now this is a great way to introduce someone new to you while giving them value at the same time, using this very specific buying journey.

[00:03:52.590] - Monica
You are not giving them choices because when they are new to you, you don't want to overwhelm them. So, let's look at an example of a sales funnel and then we'll compare it to an example of a shop to see the difference here. So here is an opt in for my free printable budgeting planner. When you come to this page, there is nothing else for you to do but hand over your email address for the free budget printable planner. Once you do that, you are redirected here to our limited-time offer tripwire page, where I'm offering you to take your budgeting digital with our family budget spreadsheet.

[00:04:27.490] - Monica
It is a $9 offer and I've been on the page for a while, so I have stopped the timer from running, from redirecting. So, I could show you this. But after 20 minutes, it redirects to a full price offer. So, for 20 minutes, you can get the spreadsheet for $9. And if you go ahead and click on the buy button, what's going to happen is you're going to be taken to the shopping cart.

[00:04:50.030] - Monica
Now there's only one thing that you can buy in the shopping cart, the family budget spreadsheet. And you can choose to add on the order bump, which is the debt payoff spreadsheet. But there are no other choices. So, the whole point of this is to not confuse new people. Now let's talk about the difference.

[00:05:06.180] - Monica
What looks different when you're in a storefront or a shop? Okay, so what is a storefront? It's a centralized location for all of your products. It grows with you as you build out multiple products, right? So, you don't have to build a new sales page.

[00:05:24.060] - Monica
You just have to create a new product listing. It has the ability to add multiple items to the checkout cart, right? Like I just showed you, the checkout cart for family budget spreadsheet. You were not adding additional items to it. You weren't in a shopping cart mentality.

[00:05:38.340] - Monica
And also, a shop gives you the ability to offer multiple marketing incentives to increase your average order value. So, when you're running a digital product shop, you're going to really care about producing marketing triggers inside of your shop that get people to add multiple things to the cart because you want to increase your average order value. If you increase your average order value with all of these tactics, by getting multiple products added to the cart, you can predict the trends of how much your shop will make in the future. So, now let me show you what a shop looks like in comparison to a sales funnel. When you are shopping in a shop, this is our empowered shop.

[00:06:16.860] - Monica
What will happen is there's multiple things that you can buy. So, this is the main page, but I'm just going to go to one of the categories just to illustrate my point here, so I can add a multitude of things to my shopping cart. So, let's just do this. We're going to add this and then let's go over here and we're going to add this, and then really cool things happen, which I'll show you later in the presentation that will help us increase our average order value. So, the point here is a sales funnel takes somebody who does not know you, provides a hyper specific buying journey.

[00:06:50.940] - Monica
In other words, they have a problem, you're giving them a specific solution, which is your digital product. You are not overwhelming them. In a storefront mentality, what you're doing is presenting all the things that you have to offer and they can add multiple things to their cart. And so, we break this down by sales funnel, new people, shop, existing audience.

[00:07:15.930] - Monica
So, I spent a long time in my business hyper focused on attracting new people to me through sales funnels. And that worked great because now I have a very big warm audience that wants to buy from me. I mean, who wouldn't like that? I would focus my attention on paid ads, showing up on Instagram, participating in Summits like these, and large bundle opportunities. And in all of those instances, I needed to give my new customer a specific buying journey.

[00:07:43.150] - Monica
So, I did not overwhelm them. However, I was running into an issue. I only have so much email bandwidth, meaning I could only direct people to so many places in my emails once I formed a relationship with them. So, what would happen is that I would create a new product or host a new workshop, and I could really only tell people about it once or maybe a few times a year. As my email list grew, so did my product suite.

[00:08:07.380] - Monica
I am always coming up with new products, which are solutions for my audience. And it got to the point where I had 40 plus sales pages and no centralized way for people to buy from me. So, imagine wanting to see everything I have to offer and me telling you to go to 40 different places and check out 40 different times. Not to mention that it didn't give my audience autonomy to look around and decide what was best for them once they got to know me and my brand, I needed to give them autonomy to be able to buy the things they needed when they needed it. Centralizing our call to action to the shop meant that our emails were more concise and we had one place to send people.

[00:08:47.050] - Monica
It opened the door for a whole new marketing strategy that would focus on nurturing our current audience. So, because the first thing, what I'm getting at here, the first thing I learned when I was getting my MBA back in the day, was this it is cheaper to sell to an existing customer than acquire a new customer. And even though I knew this all along, why was I not making it easy for 50,000 plus peo,ple on my email list to see the 100 plus products I had created for them? So to set the stage in March of 2022, I felt a shift in marketing and buying behavior in the online space and particularly with my audience. We all know that the world has been a different place over the last two to three years, and there is a lot of economic concern right now.

[00:09:35.260] - Monica
Historically, my business operated on a live launch model. This meant that we would have about four cash injections a year. And during the down months when we were not live launching a bigger product, I would have a very tight handle on our expenses to make sure that we were not overspending because we were bringing in less money. With putting all of our energy into live launching, we neglected all the other products that we had created. Plus our live launches were not increasing in terms of money that we were bringing in.

[00:10:03.380] - Monica
So, I knew something had to change and we needed a new strategy. So, to give an idea of how little of a strategy we had to sell to our ongoing warm audience, look at what the shop did for us in all of 2021. $7,000, just shy of $8,000. Now look what happened when we started putting our focus on the shop in March of 2022. For the first eleven months of 2022, we made over $140,000.

[00:10:31.560] - Monica
So, clearly, my audience was begging to buy things from me, but I was not giving them a good way to do. So for the remainder of this presentation, I want to walk you through a high level overview of how we've started to utilize our storefront. Basically, the big picture strategy breaks down like this. We have two things that we focus on traffic, how we get people to the shop, and then experience. So with traffic, we use multiple marketing techniques to drive traffic consistently to the shop from our warm audience of people who already know, like and trust us, and for the experience once they're in the shop.

[00:11:07.170] - Monica
We concentrate on the buying experience once they are there, so we can increase our average order value, which means getting them to add multiple things to their shopping cart. So, this is my philosophy on pricing our digital products in the shop. Digital products are created one time and you can sell them over and over again. They are a leverageable asset, so the price of the individual product is not as important as incentivizing more products to be added to the cart. When we flipped our mentality on pricing, to think about it this way, it changed everything for us.

[00:11:41.790] - Monica
Our main way of driving people into the shop is with email marketing, and we do this in a variety of different ways. We have weekly flash sales, Friday. Every Friday at 03:00 pm, we have trained our audience to expect a Friday deal. We do new product launches in the shop. We also offer seasonal or themed storewide discounts that layer on top of these deals.

[00:12:02.090] - Monica
And then we also have welcome and funnel specific one time use coupons. So, we want to train our audience to expect a special deal from us at the same time every week. We came up with this Friday and that's Friday at 03:00 pm. We did not tell people to expect this. We tell people we were going to start doing it.

[00:12:19.240] - Monica
We just became very consistent with doing it. And now people expect it, and they're always looking forward to what the new deal is going to be. And then we also will layer on discounts from time to time to make that deal even better, like store wide discounts. The offer on something like this, when you're training your audience to expect a really awesome offer from you, it should be a stupid, no brainer offer. Friday and flash sales are a good way to bring a spotlight on products that you haven't talked about in a while or super relevant ones that may be seasonal. So, for example, I have a lot of goal planning type resources.

[00:12:54.780] - Monica
At the end of the year, those are very appropriate products. Now keep in mind, if I was sending people direct to a sales page and not to the shop, then if I was running a Friday and I wanted you to buy my online goal planning workshop, let's say, and I sent you to a sales page, that's all you could buy for me. So the idea of a Friday is I get you to go to buy the Friday deal, but then all the other marketing triggers in the store will set in and you're going to add more things to your cart. You see the power of this. Okay, so flash sales and new product launches.

[00:13:27.240] - Monica
So, a flash sale could be on something you already have or it could be on a new product to drum up excitement for the week. We typically run our flash sales from Wednesday to 03:00 pm on Friday, and then it flips out to the Friday. And then also welcome and funnel discounts. Yes, you can actually leverage your sales funnels to then drive people to your online shop. So, once they have come through one of your funnels and you gave them that hyper specific buying journey in that follow up welcome sequence, you can introduce the other things that you have to offer to them.

[00:13:58.920] - Monica
And one way I like to do that is by giving them a deeper than usual storewide discount. That's a one-time use discount. So, now let's talk about the customer experience. For this, there are a few things we use convert box which will cover what that is, product spotlights, compare at pricing, and announcement bar, and then also order bumps and upsells, also relevant to the shopping experience, not just in sales funnels. So, the first one I want to talk about is convert box.

[00:14:27.930] - Monica
This displays one time, this specific convert box. We use it for multiple things. We use it for flash sale discounts. Like we just had a big Black Friday deal. So we had a convert box that popped up to let you know about it.

[00:14:40.810] - Monica
Typically if you are new to our shop, what's going to pop up is this welcome box. Welcome to the shop, give us your name and email and we'll send you a 30% off one time use coupon. That's typically a deeper discount than we would offer at any other time. So, if someone who doesn't know us yet does happen to come to our shop, it's also a way to collect their email address even if they're not ready to buy anything from us.

[00:15:03.810] - Monica
The other thing we use on our main page there is something called the product spotlight on our theme. So, we are always highlighting whatever the deal is. Once you arrive at our shop on the main page, that's going on. We also use something called compare at pricing. You can see here the original price is $97 and then we mark it down to $47.

[00:15:24.010] - Monica
So, we show the price savings by using a feature called compare at pricing. On the top of our shop, we have an announcement bar so we can always call attention to what's going on. We typically use the announcement bar mainly to call out when we have a storewide discount going on. Order bumps. We use an app called Honeycomb. And this particular, the way I do order bumps, what happens is when you add something to the cart, and I'll show you this in real time.

[00:15:55.480] - Monica
When you add something to your shopping cart and you're ready to go shop out or check out, upon going to the checkout page, you're going to be offered a special offer on another product. This is a great way to get multiple products added to a cart. So, I'm just going to go back to my shop and go to check out and show you what happens. Here you go.

[00:16:13.160] - Monica
So, now I'm offering you a discount, a 30% discount on my CEO business planning spreadsheet. You can add it to your order or skip and continue right on to check out. Now, the other thing we use Honeycomb for is upsells. Now, upsells take place in my shop after the order is placed. So, likeI'm not going to actually place an order in real time.

[00:16:33.230] - Monica
So, what would happen if I went and proceeded with that order I just showed you? Afterwards, one of these pop-ups would come up, looks similar to the order bump, but it would be a different offer. And usually, I discount my upsells more than my order bumps. There's a whole methodology behind that. But these are just different marketing triggers that we use to get people to add more to their cart and come back to our shop.

[00:16:58.790] - Monica
Okay, now one of the reasons this has been such a successful strategy for us is because we are extremely organized on the back end. There are a lot of moving parts having a shop, but it really is not that difficult if you are organized. So, just for people who joined the Blogger Breakthrough Summit, I am giving a free copy of our shopify listing template, or a shoplifting template. This is the exact template we use to track all of the information that is relevant to each of our shop listings. Having this information at your fingertips makes listing new products super easy and running strategic marketing campaigns to your email list even easier.

[00:17:35.800] - Monica
So, you can go on over to empoweredbusiness.co/BBS2023, so Blogger Breakthrough Summit 2023, to get your free listing template now. Also, I put this handy QR code. You might have already seen it throughout the presentation slides and tried to go there already, but you can just hold your phone up to the slide right now and scan that QR code. It's going to take you right there.

[00:17:59.450] - Monica
It makes it super easy. So, I hope you found this presentation helpful, and I can't wait to see what kind of storefront you will create in the future. I can't wait to hear about it
