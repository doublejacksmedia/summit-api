Hey, guys. I'm really excited for our next speaker. She's going to be talking about YouTube, which is something I'm working on improving myself. She is a lawyer, a mental health advocate, and a booktuber. Please welcome Rachel Eyo to the Summit. Rachel, thanks for being here.

[00:00:32.910] - Rachel
Thank you. Thank you for having me. So excited to meet you. 

[00:00:36.460] - Liz
Yeah. So first I feel like, quick question on your background. What is a booktuber? I feel like a lot of people may not know.

[00:00:46.230] - Rachel
Yeah. Okay. So a booktuber is basically somebody who creates videos that are book related on YouTube. So I am a booktuber. I principally create videos on YouTube that are centered around book. So book reviews, book recommendations, reading recommendations, book challenges, or fun ways to do that. So that's basically what booktuber does on YouTube.

[00:01:12.280] - Liz
Okay. So for those when you get started with YouTube, what is sort of the first step they should take? 

[00:01:21.170] - Rachel
Yeah. So if someone wants to get started with YouTube, whether it's BookTubing or just YouTube in general, I think the first thing that they should do is just actually start. A lot of people don't like, want to start and then they don't know how to start. They want to get all the right equipment. You want to get cameras or lighting or things like that.I started with my phone and natural light. I didn't even have a ring light. I just started with my phone and so I just started.

[00:01:53.860] - Rachel
But in deciding what part of YouTube I wanted to be in, I had to do a little bit of research because I am very passionate about books. I love to read. And I decided that I was just going to sort of niche down into books and maybe some other things as well.

[00:02:11.540] - Rachel
So I would suggest that, first of all, you not only start with where you are, in terms of what equipment you have. Maybe it's your phone or your tripod or whatever, you don't have to have the most expensive gadgets. That's where you can start. And you can also do some research to see what people are in certain fields are passionate about. It could be make up, film, it could be books, it could be nature.

[00:02:50.910] - Rachel
Whatever it is that you like to talk about or record, you can do some research and also just try to narrow it down so that your channel is not focused on so many things at once.

[00:03:08.470] - Liz
Okay. So, you say do research. Are you researching on YouTube? Are you using a tool?

[00:03:16.150] - Rachel
Okay. So to answer your question in terms of research, yes, it will be helpful to do research on YouTube. You're doing research on YouTube to find out what type of videos people are creating in a field that you might be very passionate about. You want to find out how well those videos are doing. If you want a large subscriber account, especially if you're just starting out, you want to be in a popular area of YouTube. It would be great to do some research on YouTube and then you can also do some research on normal search engines like Google, just to find out how successful people are doing in that field that you might want to get into in YouTube. So YouTube and Google and other search engines. 

[00:04:00.950] - Liz
Okay. So when you're looking at YouTube and you're trying to see how well a topic is doing, what are you looking at? Are you looking at someone's subscriber count? Are you looking at views? What is your main focus?

[00:04:12.910] - Rachel
Yeah, we're looking at views. We're looking at the words that are being used on the title of the videos, if the words are like catchy enough, the way the video is made. So with book tubing, for example, some people have sit down videos where you sit down and you just talk about a book, you have your bookshelf behind you and you're talking about a book that you really love. Or you can have a reading blog where you vlog your experiences. Maybe you went to a bookstore or you met up with a friend that loves to talk about books. So you sort of want to know what kind of videos are being created. And then yes, you can look at the views and maybe the subscriber counts, but that's for when you've gone far at the beginning stage, it's quite slow, especially with BookTube.

[00:05:01.430] - Liz
Okay, so you're doing kind of keyword research.

[00:05:03.460] - Rachel
Yes.

[00:05:03.800] - Liz
So that was kind of one of the other questions I had. How long does it take to see traction? Is there ways to speed that up?

[00:05:11.810] - Rachel
Well, definitely. I'll say the best way to speed that up. The truth is you have to go through the process. I mean, a few people have videos that go viral the first time they post on YouTube, right? And some people call it beginners luck. Some people will be like, "Well, I've been on YouTube for five years. I only have ten subscribers."

[00:05:31.050] - Rachel
But I will say, especially because I do booktube in a genre, that is not very popular. I talk a lot about African literature and literature in general, but I would say the best way to speed it up will be to post consistently. As a person beginning on YouTube, beginner, you have to post consistently. You have to upload consistently. You have to be able to interact with other fellow YouTubers, preferably smaller YouTubers, because they're the ones who want to connect and network with you. But maybe three to four times if it's possible a week when you're just starting. Because if you do once a week, people tend to forget about you because you're yet to make your name. And then the YouTube algorithm is yet to sort of recognize you or refer you to other YouTubers or people who watch YouTube a lot. So posting consistently would definitely help to speed up. That growth.

[00:06:31.890] - Liz
Okay, SEO, when you're doing the research, you mentioned, what kind of words are they using as kind of keywords because YouTube is its own search engine. Is there a way you're kind of tracking keywords or keeping a list for video ideas. What do you recommend?

[00:06:49.470] - Rachel
Okay, well, so for me personally, I know I downloaded Tube Buddy. I'm not like an ambassador or anything, but I think that there are some apps that help you with keyword, maybe optimization and search engine. Just to tell you what words on YouTube will have a lot of views. What the SEO might look like if you actually released a video with a certain title that had a keyword.

[00:07:16.290] 
So, I personally, I used Tube Buddy. So when I'm uploading, I'm able to see if I want to put a tag. I'm able to see how popular those keywords are. When I've uploaded the video, I go back and I'm able to see what my SEO score is. It's like out of 100. So if the words in the title are not that popular, I probably get 17 out of 100. And if it's really popular, maybe like 95 out of 100 So yeah, so maybe using YouTube related apps could help in terms of determining what words are popular out there. But I personally used Tube Buddy. I think there are a bunch of other ones out there. I don't know about them.

[00:07:55.110] - Liz
Yeah, no, there's lots of different tools. Okay. So when you're a beginner, obviously you're not going to qualify for ads on YouTube overnight. That's a requirement of like 1000 subscribers, 400,000 watch time hours? What is it...

[00:08:13.650] - Rachel
4000 hours

[00:08:15.270] - Liz
...4000 hours over the course of a year. But you can certainly monetize in other ways. How do you recommend beginners try to monetize their YouTube channel to make it worth their while, while they're building up.

[00:08:29.490] - Rachel
Right. Okay, so, I would first say that when you're beginning YouTube, it's really advisable that you don't really like go into it saying, "Oh my goodness, I was doing this for money and money alone." Because usually what draws people who are willing to maybe spend money or sponsor something that you would have are often drawn to someone's passion and their expression. So, I think that other ways that people can monetize is they can probably have sponsorship. People tend to sponsor like they'll give you an item and sponsor your video to get to talk about it, maybe for a few minutes. You can put this at the beginning of your video or at the end of your video. If you also have a large following on social media, maybe you can have like an influencer post where you can put up a post on your stories, on your feed, on Instagram or Twitter or whatever. And then people can see that and they can pay you for that. Also, you can have maybe like a newsletter or maybe an email subscription where people can subscribe to your email every month. They get to keep up with you and see how you're doing. And you give them exclusive content where they can have access to the other subscribers may not.

[00:09:54.430] - Rachel
And then you have things like the Patreon. You have, Get a Cup of Coffee, (BuyMeACoffee) a lot of creators often use that when they're not monetized. So people can actually send you money. People will even do just the normal when you click a link, somebody can send you money just to support your creative journey. If you can't have a Patreon or I know there are some countries that can have Patreon or maybe grab a coffee, that kind of thing. So those are things that people can actually explore if they're trying to monetize to make it their well. And you would just be surprised. A lot of people will vibe with your content and want to support your creative journey and just help out with that.

[00:10:32.370] - Liz
Awesome. Okay, so what are some tips you have for beginner bloggers, that may not be obvious. I know the first summit I ever did, one of the tips was to send a default description. It was like, life changing for me. So what are some tips? Sort of some things that maybe you do on Default that a beginner may not realize they could do.

[00:10:56.490] - Rachel
Okay, well, when you say Default, I did have to do research to learn some of these things. So I think maybe three major ones were on Default was just to be myself in expressing myself and creating my content, being authentic and following what I'm really passionate about. There's that temptation to look at what other people are doing, other people with higher subscriber counts and high views and say, oh, that's what I want to do. Meanwhile, you have no passion for it or you're not even interested in talking about it. A lot of people need to provide with authenticity, so you have to be authentic. I feel like that's one major thing for me.

[00:11:40.010] - Rachel
And another one was in terms of edits, or you know, the best camera or whatever. But the way you edit, that's one thing I learned at the beginning. The way you edit really helps people to stay longer, to watch your videos. So you want to edit in an entertaining way in terms of, you don't want to have like a really long, drawn-out video where you're thinking about something, that is taking you three minutes to come up with it and you leave that part in the video. You should be able to edit that out so that people see that in a fun way. And if you have blocks, you can edit that in an entertaining way.

[00:12:12.180] - Rachel
And I think another tip for me that, well, maybe it wasn't like really Default, I guess was. One tip that I really practiced when I first started was to learn patience like to be patient. Because everybody wants to grow to 5000 subscribers within the first week. Everybody wants to grow to 10,000 within the first month. But I had to sort of like learn that patience and take it one step at a time. And just while I'm doing that, I'm also prioritizing my mental health and taking time off while I'm creating what I love to create. So, yeah, those three things were key to me at the beginning.

[00:12:52.180] - Liz
Yeah. I'm like, don't beat yourself up over it. The thing is, I always have to. It's a lesson I've learned is you can put in all the work and effort, but you can't control the outcome. So just...

[00:13:05.380] - Rachel
Exactly.

[00:13:06.430] - Liz
Don't beat yourself up if the outcome isn't what you hoped.

[00:13:10.090] - Rachel
Exactly.

[00:13:13.310] - Liz
Okay, so what are some of the biggest mistakes you see or you think beginners make when getting started with YouTube?

[00:13:25.890] - Rachel
Yeah, I think that people come into, like I said, YouTube thinking, I just want to make that money and I'm going to make it the first time. And it's not bad to have that view. But I think that the number one thing is it sort of shows when you are not really being passionate about what you're talking about, you're not interested in it and you're in some weird way, it shows. So I think that one mistake would be to come into YouTube or video blogging saying, you know what, I'm just coming into it for the money and I don't really care so much about anything like that. And you can see that in the video.So I would say to correct that mistake, like I had said earlier, make sure that you're talking about something that you're passionate about. You're creating videos on things that you're passionate about.

[00:14:09.920] - Rachel
Another mistake would be to not actively engage with other smaller YouTubers. You're coming in as a small YouTuber. You only have five subscribers. A lot of people stay in their own corners and then you're not able to grow because you don't have generating subscribers. So to correct that, it's best to go to like, what would you call it? Smaller YouTubers that create similar content, go on their comment page, don't spam their comment section, but watch their videos, leave meaningful comments, try to connect with them and see how that goes so that you can grow your content.

[00:14:51.590] - Rachel
I think a third one would be what we call sub for sub, where you just want to go really fast. And so, it's called subscriber for subscriber. So you see a lot of smaller YouTubers because you don't want to be patient to create content and grow. You then start trying to have a group of people where they subscribe to your channel. You subscribe back, they don't watch your content, you don't watch theirs. You're just trying to grow your subscriber count. What happens that YouTube eventually finds out anyways and then cuts them off? So they might even suspend you, especially if you're doing that a lot. They might suspend your channel or they might give you strikes. They might say, oh, you violated community guidelines. So that is a very big mistake that a lot of new YouTubers use, especially when they're not trying to be patient. We call it sub for sub. Yeah.

[00:15:43.110] - Liz
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Even if you're trying to grow only follow people, you're actually going to watch their stuff that you're interested in.

[00:15:46.670] - Rachel
Exactly, exactly, exactly. 

[00:15:49.810] - Liz
For sure. So, I want to take a step back because you mentioned editing, because obviously you can start with just your camera or your phone, rather camera. But editing can be a little daunting. What tools or resources do you recommend to learn how to edit and to do the actual editing?

[00:16:14.810] - Rachel
Right. Okay, so when I first started, I use an iPhone. So when I first started, I started using editing with the Imovie. It comes with the iPhone, I think. So it's an Imovie app. It's very basic, very simple, easy to use if you're just trying to start out with editing.

[00:16:32.270] - Rachel
I had no prior experience with editing videos, so I was learning as I was going and I was like, "You know what? I'm not going to wait until it's perfect." Your first couple of videos will be terrible, so don't even try to make it perfect, except your professional video editor.

[00:16:48.380] - Rachel
But currently, on my phone, I use KineMaster. That's another app that people can try out. K-I-N-E. Master is one word. So I use that to edit, and it's pretty simple. You can edit on the go. If it's on your phone, you don't have to have your laptop with you. So if you shoot the videos on your phone, you can edit on your phone, send it to your phone. If you can even upload on your phone, fine. But sometimes I have to send to my laptop and then I do that.

[00:17:16.530] - Rachel
So I would recommend those two. If you don't have any prior experience with editing videos and you're just trying to learn on the go. Of course, there's a whole lot of other editing apps out there. There's a lot of them that even go on your laptop. If you have a laptop and you like to edit. I don't really know about those ones. I'm yet to try them out, but I would say for it beginner these two are perfectly fine. 

[00:17:45.570] - Liz
Yeah, I use Imovie to edit most of my stuff, to be perfectly honest. I'm not super fancy, but I use YouTube to figure out how to do things in it. Just very full circle there. Okay, YouTube is your friend when you're trying to learn.

[00:18:09.330] - Rachel
Just to add that if somebody's trying to learn how to edit or once recommend literally just Google. How can I edit this? Like the things that you find on Google and YouTube, you'll be so amazed. Like, even if you go, how can I put a laughing sound behind what I'm saying? How can I put like a clapping effect or an animated effect? Just type, no matter how crazy it sounds, you'll get at least 500 results and you can click on it and learn how to edit and add things and remove thing. (inaudible) So the Internet today is a lovely place.

[00:18:57.490] - Liz
Yes. Lots of people share their knowledge for free to help you learn. So definitely do that. Okay, so I feel like we've covered a good amount of ground. Any final words of advice or things people should know if they're getting started with YouTube.

[00:19:14.710] - Rachel
Yeah. So like I said, create what you're passionate about. Have fun while you're creating videos. Be authentic, stay true to yourself. Of course upload frequently and try to be consistent.

[00:19:29.250] - Rachel
But most importantly prioritize your mental health when you're creating, if you feel really overwhelmed or burned out, take a break and be okay with taking breaks. Of course, don't compare yourself to another YouTuber who has been there for like five years and you just started five months. You're already feeling pressured.

[00:19:52.150] - Rachel
Take it one day at a time and of course the last thing I would say is just to be patient with yourself, be patient and see the results. Like you said, you can't control the outcome, put in as much as you can and just see how it goes. So I think just be patient with yourself as you create.

[00:20:10.630] - Liz
Fantastic. All right. And if those watching want to connect more with you, how can they do that? Where can they find you?
