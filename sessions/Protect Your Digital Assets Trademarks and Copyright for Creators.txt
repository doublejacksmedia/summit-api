Liz Stapleton [00:00:00]:
Hey, guys. Today, I'm super excited for this session with Jamie Lieberman from Hashtag Legal. She is a lawyer. who's been helping bloggers figure out the legal side of stuff for years, and I've seen her speaking at conferences. She's fantastic, so I'm really excited to have her. Thank you for coming.

Jamie Lieberman [00:00:15]:
Thanks for having me. So I'm very excited to be here. I do wanna say at first before we start anything. This is not legal advice. This is just information and opinion, if you do need legal advice that I recommend that you speak to an attorney about your specific business.

Liz Stapleton [00:00:31]:
Yes. because as we were talking before we hit report is the legal side of stuff is just people don't think about it, and it's so grossly, like, underrepresented. in this sort of business, and particularly, I think the people the stuff that scares people the most is what we're gonna talk about today's trademarks and copyright.

Jamie Lieberman [00:00:52]:
I think that's right.

Liz Stapleton [00:00:55]:
And I think copyright's usually the more approachable topics, and maybe we'll start there because people have a better idea of what that is. It's like don't steal images. You don't want people stealing yours, but there's a little more to it. Can you just I'm gonna let you maybe intro that topic for us.

Jamie Lieberman [00:01:10]:
Yeah. You got it. I do. It's so funny. I just had a phone call today with someone who was like, can you just tell me the difference? And so That's perfect. It is a very commonly asked question. So copyright, the way that I like to explain copyright is all about what you're creating. and so it's an original work of some kind. And so I always like to say original work of art. It doesn't mean art like the Mona Lisa, It just means something that you've created. An original also doesn't have to be mean, Mona Lisa as well, but what that just means is you created it yourself. So if I'm looking at out my window and I see a stop sign and I take a picture of it, that image is copyright protected as soon as I take it. the so it's any work of art. So it could be a book, a blog post, an image. it could be graphic. Exactly. It could be as a a principle that you create. and the important thing to remember is it's not the idea that is copyright protected. but it is actually the way that you, show that idea. So the way that you put it on paper, a really common way to talk about this is through recipes. so many people know and sort of, like, one of those facts on the back of your head that recipes are not copyright protected. And that's just because it's just a listing of ingredients. However, how you present that recipe, your images, how you talk about it. The story that you may talk about. If your grandmother made this chicken soup that you're talking about, that can all be copyright protected. And even a cookbook, the way that you arrange your recipes can be copyright protected. so it's important to remember it's not an idea, but actually how you've presented that idea and put that idea down. yeah, published. Exactly. Yes. That's exactly right.

Liz Stapleton [00:02:52]:
Yeah. because I know I had that problem. Someone was stealing my Instagram and images, and then he's reposts to do it. And I was like, well, now I know you're stealing them. Take them down. It's a violation of copyright. It does nothing for me. You know, I don't care if that's common practice, and she she took them down. but who knows how many more she's stole.

Jamie Lieberman [00:03:09]:
-- I I get those questions a lot because so many people repost images. And I said, honestly, that is copy likely copyright infringement unless you've gotten permission of some kind. It's just everybody does it.

Liz Stapleton [00:03:20]:
Yes. Yes. you can if you see someone doing that, it's your step. You can you can step in. You're, you know, and people when I told them about this, they looked at Instagram, and I was, like, in in their terms of service. Yeah. It's copyright.

Jamie Lieberman [00:03:32]:
Yeah. There's a reason that Instagram doesn't have the functionality to let you share that image to your feed. because it is potentially copyright infringement, and it's important to protect your intellectual property.

Liz Stapleton [00:03:45]:
Absolutely. And so I think another people get people get confused about most popular is they're like, do I have to register it? So do they and it I know the answer. So I'll let you answer, and then we'll dig into when or why they might or how. Yeah.

Jamie Lieberman [00:04:01]:
So the answer is to have copyright protection. You do not need to register it. However, registration gives you some really great benefits. so the minute that you create that work so I'm gonna use a picture We'll use it on our Instagram feed. The minute I take that picture, I have what's called a common law copyright protection. And common law just means that it's created by the court system versus being created by a statute because there is a copyright act, and that is boring stuff that no one cares but you get common law copyright protection, and that means that somebody can't use it. They can't take it. They can't steal it. They can't do other things with it. And with that copyright comes and you'll probably remember this from law school, the bundle of sticks, which always makes me laugh. because in law school, for some reason, they The law school professors like to talk about the bundle of rights that you get like a like an actual bundle of sticks.

Liz Stapleton [00:04:54]:
Yeah.

Jamie Lieberman [00:04:55]:
and there's all these rights that you get with owning a copyright, the right to display it, the right to perform it, the right to distribute it, and the really important right, which a lot of people should know this term of art is the right to create a derivative work. and we'll talk about what that means, but there's all these rights you have copyright and you own all of them when you create that work. And it's up to you to be able to know what to do with it. You can give it away. You can sell it. You can keep it for yourself. You can choose to give away one of them, which is why you give one of your sticks away. So, for example, I can give somebody permission to display my work but I won't give them the permission to distribute it, or, like, commercially or to create a derivative work. Okay.

Liz Stapleton [00:05:37]:
I just wanna pause there. It's a really good point in terms of stock photos you purchase is sometimes you're able to use it for, like, social media graphics, but you're not able to use it for commercial purposes. So, like, in, like, a digital product you create.

Jamie Lieberman [00:05:49]:
That's exactly right. And all the language that we're talking about is licensing. So this is all licensing. So the rights that you have in your copyright are essentially what you can give away or sell. When you give them away, you give them away. You've given permission. When you sell them, that's called a license, if you fully sell every single right, that's a work made for hire. So that's a term you should know about. If you see it in a contract and it says work for hire, it means you will have no rights left in that copyright in whatever work that you've created. If you license some of those rights, say, for example, the license to display, you are keeping as the copyright under the rest of those rights to yourself. So you're only giving them away or selling that one renting it per se because maybe you'd be able to take it back. these are really important things to know when you're looking at a contract at least to recognize those terms so you know what to think about or what to ask your lawyer about.

Liz Stapleton [00:06:49]:
Yeah. absolutely. So if you were to decide to register, so you don't have to register to have your copyright if you were to decide to register, how would you go about it and sort of how often because I feel like as well as we're constantly creating So I feel like that can be really tedious. What would you kind of recommend or say?

Jamie Lieberman [00:07:09]:
So the shocking thing is the government has not caught up to the digital age. And it is impossible to have an ongoing registration for your blog, because it's constantly changing. And so each posts. Like, you can't there are certain ways. Like, if you launch a blog and you have a whole bunch of posts, you can do that. Photographers will frequently batch their photos so they take them, but they don't actually publish them. And then you can actually batch those images in a copyright registration. So you're not doing each photo individually. So unpublished works, and this is a really great tip for course creators before publishing your course, you can do a batch copyright registration of that whole course. If you've published it and you wanna go back and copyright register it, it can be messy and complicated because every single video, every single download is its own work, and it can be really expensive and overwhelming. So that is a really good tip to remember is published versus unpublished. It's actually very easy to do copyright registration. And this is one of those areas where DIY, I think, is completely fine. not expensive. I think the filing fee is about $55. and then you're just essentially filling out a form. The copyright office does not look into the validity of your copyright in a different way that the trademark office looks into the validity of trade. They're totally run. and we will. But copy rights are fairly simple. You could do it yourself if you need or want to. Some of my clients are like, I'll do it myself and other of my are like, I want no part of that. So you just have to make a personal choice as to what makes sense for you and what you're most comfortable with doing. the nice thing so with a blog, Here's my recommendation for people. If you have, say, 20 posts, 20 images, any product that you're creating or selling, Those are the ones that I think the top 20, say your most viral photos, your most popular posts, the things that get pinned the most If you're gonna go the right of copyright registration, that's what I always recommend doing. It's the easiest way. And just keep an eye on it. Maybe once a year, look at your traffic, say, This is kind of a popular post. I'm just gonna do a quick registration for it. If you're selling any digital product, courses, downloads, ebooks, anything. I definitely recommend registering that for copyright. It just makes it so much easier to stop someone from copying.

Liz Stapleton [00:09:28]:
That's a great point. and so now that we've kind of you've got the copyrights You registered whatever, you know, you needed to or felt you should. What do you do if someone steals it?

Jamie Lieberman [00:09:42]:
Yeah. That stinks. I hate I hate hearing these. So The first thing that you have to look at is do I have a valid copyright registration? And if you do, if you have a valid copyright registration, you have certain rights. So your first right is you have a right to sue somebody for copyright infringement in federal court if you need to. You have the right to get potentially staff victory damages, which means I don't have to prove that I was damaged. Just by nature of the registration, I get certain damages. You also have the ability to get attorney's fees in certain instances if you are forced to sue. You also have assumption of validity. So it's presumed that your copyright is valid. and the other side is to show that it isn't. So that's a huge burden that if you don't have that registration, you have to jump through those hoops. So those alone are really amazing reasons. to have copyright registration because when you, unfortunately, somebody does copy you, when you send that letter, The first thing that other person's attorney, if they have one and they're smart, is going to look for is, does this person have a registration? And if they have a registration, nine times out of

Liz Stapleton [00:10:45]:
10,

Jamie Lieberman [00:10:46]:
they're gonna say, settle this case, and you could get you could get money for it. So having the registration does have some great benefits. If you don't have the registration, don't despair. you certainly can still send a cease and desist. You still have the right to ask people to pull down anything that you've created that's that's yours and that you own the copyright for. it's just you have more hoops to jump through and the lawyers don't act as quickly. Although they do act, particularly if you have a lawyer send a letter on your behalf.

Liz Stapleton [00:11:15]:
Yes. cease and desist is always the kind of 1st thing. And and you can do a formal one through a lawyer, but you can also, depending on the, like, like, if it's a couple of images, they didn't, like, fill your entire site. you might just reach out and be like, hey. Not cool. Take a chance. Or I'm gonna have my lawyer get involved.

Jamie Lieberman [00:11:31]:
I actually really encourage that, particularly because at a certain point, like, Are you gonna fight over a little bit of money? You have to make that. If it's a product that you've created and and they've copied your whole course.

Liz Stapleton [00:11:41]:
Yeah. Your entire site or something. That's different. Another thing I wouldn't reach out personally. I would just go to the lawyer route. Yeah.

Jamie Lieberman [00:11:48]:
Totally agree. The other thing also to think about is sometimes when you file a lot of people file DMCA take down notices. Sometimes the hosts, they don't respond till they hear from a lawyer. so I've had clients who have been trying to do it themselves. They come to me in within a day, the rate is taken down. So that is definitely another advantage to utilizing a lawyer as we tend to get a little bit more traction a little faster. Yeah.

Liz Stapleton [00:12:11]:
Take get taken a little more seriously.

Jamie Lieberman [00:12:14]:
Yeah. The

Liz Stapleton [00:12:14]:
other thing to kind of take note is depending on where it's at, right, because we talked about, you know, Instagram, you know, that may give you another, like, hey. It's in their terms of service. They they will kick you off you're found too of, like, stolen images. Right? So sometimes, you know, if you don't necessarily have your Instagram, things that you've created, copyrighted,

Jamie Lieberman [00:12:35]:
Yes.

Liz Stapleton [00:12:36]:
Instagram's terms of services give you a little leverage as well.

Jamie Lieberman [00:12:39]:
Yes. Exactly. Although cautionary tale, I did have a client who filed about a 1000 DMC take down notices with Pinterest. It was I wish I was exaggerating that, and she got threatened with a pretty severe lawsuit because she was ultimately starting to harass the other party. So do take it seriously. A DMC take down notice is not something to do in anger. it's not something to do unless you're very certain that you've been copied. And if you have, you should absolutely use that tool, but it can get you you definitely wanna make sure that you're doing it, using it judiciously.

Liz Stapleton [00:13:14]:
Yes. Yes. Not every little thing. because like you said, it's the first thing you have to do is that is is actually kind of violation of my copyright.

Jamie Lieberman [00:13:21]:
Yes. Exactly. Yeah. I mean, that goes back to the whole idea of ideas are not copyright protected. So I get a lot of emails from, bloggers who may have done, like, a DIY tutorial and Target or some other company picks it up and makes it themselves, and they're angry and upset. Understandably, they've created it. but the end result is not real doesn't have a high levels of copyright protection, so it's pretty challenging sort of go after, a large company for doing that. So it's important to understand what is copyright protectable.

Liz Stapleton [00:13:54]:
Yes. And you can always reach out to a lawyer for that as well.

Jamie Lieberman [00:13:57]:
Yeah. Sure. Agree.

Liz Stapleton [00:14:00]:
Alright. So let's because I feel like now we're starting to drift into trademarks a little bit just in the idea of, I remember seeing this posted in a blogging Facebook group because don't you get just the like, examples and questions there. Someone's like, oh my gosh. I can't believe it. I created this thing, and I got it, notice saying I can't name it this.

Jamie Lieberman [00:14:20]:
Ah.

Liz Stapleton [00:14:21]:
And it literally was the same kind of product that the trademark was for, and we're like, no. Really, you have to, like, change your name.

Jamie Lieberman [00:14:30]:
So -- Change it fast.

Liz Stapleton [00:14:31]:
Yes. So so let's, first of all, why don't you kind of explain what a trademark is? Because it feel like we really don't understand that term at all.

Jamie Lieberman [00:14:41]:
Totally agree. So a trademark, I like to tell people to look at trademarks from the perspective of the consumer. So don't think about it as the business owner, but think about you as a consumer. A trademark is a source indicator, meaning I am going to look at something, and I'm going to know exactly who or what created it, whether it's a good or a service. So Nike is my favorite example to use because we have that beautiful swoosh, which is absolutely trademark protected. And so when you see a Nike swoosh, you know what you're getting. You know, you're getting a pair of sneakers. You know what the quality is gonna be. you know, likely what the aesthetic is going to be, and you know you're getting a nike a pair of Nike's. If someone else was allowed to put that swoosh on a pair of sneakers that would say subpar or wasn't great and it fell apart in a week, the consumer would be really baffled and wonder what was going on. And so that trademark protection is done to protect consumers. So they know what they're getting. You know what you're buying. When you walk into McDonald's, you know, their fries are gonna be amazing. And so if you got a McDa if you walked into a restaurant called McDonald's in the weren't good, you'd be very confused. So that's really how you have to look at it. So it's a source. It's a name, a logo. It can be a color. It can be a smell. We I went through this with someone, and they were like, a smell and it absolutely can. Although I don't really recommend it for most because it's hard to prove. Yeah. But Names and logos for, bloggers and content creators are the most common. The name is what we call a word mark. So your name, hashtag legal is a good example of that. And then your logo is obviously your logo. Sometimes it's just your name in a certain font or script, colors, It could also be an image. many bloggers come to me a little bit confused. Do I wanna protect my name? Do I wanna protect my logo? I tend to, recommend starting with the name of the word mark because that's usually what the source indicator is. However, if you are a content creator who, if you are a content creator who does a lot of licensing, And your logo appears on certain things. That is where your logo may come into play where you may wanna consider protecting your logo as a trademark as well. So that's also important too. And, I definitely that's a case by case basis. And this will then go into my conversation with Trademark should not be DIY ever. You need an experienced trademark practitioner. It is a very specialized area of law. It is some of the most high malpractice rates in the world for our insurance for that reason. and so many mistakes get made. So legal zooms and people who've never done trademarks before or your friend who went to law school was like, yeah, I'll try it. not your best idea.

Liz Stapleton [00:17:23]:
I don't know. I'm like, nope. I was like, you need to go to a trademark lawyer for that. I feel not my not my not in my wheelhouse.

Jamie Lieberman [00:17:30]:
It's very it's I've been doing it for a very long time, and I still learn things every single day.

Liz Stapleton [00:17:36]:
And part of it is because there's the category. Right? So your trademark only applies in your category that you've been approved on. Yes. I've gotten questions about that too. I had someone reach out and bill it because they have podcasts name, and then they saw a that they just got trademarked. They were like, pumped, and they saw someone doing a summit under the same name, but it was completely different. You know, I was like, you I was like, I don't know for sure. I was like, but it's not a podcast. So Probably out of luck there. you know, so so can you explain sort of the characteristics how that sort of works and why, you know, because I think that adds to why you need someone experience.

Jamie Lieberman [00:18:15]:
Absolutely. So those categories are called by the trademark office, the trademark class. And there are so many different classes. and they are broken down into sub classes. It is overwhelming. and, you know, sort of the automated systems, have you fill out a bunch of questions, and then they shoot out, a potential class for you. And they're always they're so crafted carefully for each individual client So what the class does is it describes the category of goods or services you're offering. So, for example, if you create an app, You're probably in class 9, which is, downloadable computer software. and then we do, like, a whole bunch of other descriptions. And so you could have multiple software, multiple companies with the same name that creates software so long as that is not potentially confusing. So the thing that everybody is always thinking about when they're thinking, can I use this name? Is this name trademark protected? is whether or not there's a likelihood of confusion between the marks. And so you have to look at that in a couple of different ways. So you look at it based on the name, the actual word or logo, depending on what you're comparing, and then the class that the the trademark is registered in. And so it is the same or similar. And this is where people get really confused the similar. It's very easy when you have 2 identical in the same exact class, offering very similar things. You're like, good. That's easy. It's where the similarity is different, and that really is kind of it's like a it's like an art. It's not a science. Every trademark examiner who has to review does it differently. Some trademark examiners passed by with, marks I am sure are gonna get rejected and others who I know should not are getting rejected. So it is really, really hard, to game the system or guess it, and you just sort of have to do your best with the tips and tricks that you know from many years of experience. And so you're creating that class to describe only what it is that you're currently doing, not what you hope to do. So if you create clothing and you only create t shirts, if you try to register with t shirts and sweatshirts and pants and socks, you're going to have to show proof of your use of that in every single category. So it's really important that you're only registering how you're using it or planning to use it.

Liz Stapleton [00:20:33]:
Okay. and then so tech is there, like, copyright sort of an a common law trademark.

Jamie Lieberman [00:20:43]:
There is. Yes. Exactly. So you just using a name does give you common law trademark protection. What that does is it gives you that geographic protection. It it gives you that protection in the geographic area you're using

Liz Stapleton [00:20:56]:
it. Mhmm.

Jamie Lieberman [00:20:57]:
Once again, Online. Yep. Yeah. So that's a tough one. usually, what ends up happening is you sort of get limited to the area where you live. And so if you're if you're doing business at home and, you know, you live in say New York City, you may be limited and you may not be able to use that mark nationwide. which is why in the age of the of the online space and utilization of marks nationwide, it is important to think about getting trademark registration. The per the first person who uses a mark, whether registered or not has what's called priority.

Liz Stapleton [00:21:29]:
Yep.

Jamie Lieberman [00:21:30]:
So you have priority of use. If someone comes in after you and tries to register a mark, that's the same or similar likelihood of confusion, you can actually stop them. even if you don't have a trademark registration, and you can prevent them from moving forward. if they succeed. You can cancel their mark. There's a lot of things that you have the potential to be able to do, but it's way easier to do. Like, it's messy. it's expensive and it's way easier to do when you have a trademark registration as well.

Liz Stapleton [00:22:00]:
Okay. yeah. And and so the difference so you could even correct me if I'm wrong. because again, not my wheelhouse. You can even do like a the TM mark, even if you're not registered, you can't do the r. That is what -- Correct. -- makes it different.

Jamie Lieberman [00:22:14]:
That is absolutely correct. So you can use a TM all day long if you want if it's a trademark. but when you go to apply to the trademark office, you have to show them. So there's 2 different applications. I should back up a little bit. There's a use in commerce application, which means you're actually using the mark in connection with with and services that you are currently selling. So you had to have made a sale. and it has to be in interstate commerce, meaning across state lines. This is for federal trademark, applications. There are state level ones. I I don't know many people who use them every once in a while if you sort of have, like, a mom and pop shop that's on the corner of a main street that doesn't cross straight lines. Yeah. You're, like,

Liz Stapleton [00:22:55]:
focused, like, your blog is about the town you're in. Correct.

Jamie Lieberman [00:22:58]:
then maybe. But even then, you usually have made an affiliate sale. So it even then, you'd probably be able to get, and it doesn't have to be a lot of money. So if people are like, oh, but I've only made, like,

Liz Stapleton [00:23:07]:
$10 dollars from Amazon?

Jamie Lieberman [00:23:09]:
Totally fine. That's enough. One sale is all you need. so that's important as well. and so once you have that, you can file a use in commerce and you need in connection with that, what are called specimens, which is just proof to the trademark office that you are using the mark in connection with those goods and services. The use has to be ongoing. You don't get to stop using it. So you have to tell the trademark office every 5 years that you're continuing to use it or you will lose it. if you're not using it, but you have a really good idea, you can file what's called an intent to use application, meaning I'm not using it yet. but I intend to use, so, say, within the next 6 6 to 18 months is usually the time frame that I give to clients. if your plans are 5 years away, You're gonna keep filing extensions and you only get so many extensions before you you don't get to save a name forever. and that's just basically because of competition. So it's important that you are using it. Continue to use it. so, yes. So the specimen just has to show has to have a connect to that, to those goods and services.

Liz Stapleton [00:24:12]:
Right. And you did mention you're like, make sure it is a trademark because not everything is

Jamie Lieberman [00:24:18]:
Yes.

Liz Stapleton [00:24:19]:
So can you shed a little more light on that?

Jamie Lieberman [00:24:21]:
Yeah. I love this. So everybody thinks about trademarks in connection with the likelihood of confusion. What what people don't think about is trademarks, the trademark office, and trademark law really likes what I call fanciful names or, arbitrary names. So fanciful being Nike. or arbitrary being Apple because an Apple exists, but nobody thinks an Apple is a computer. and so those companies really have had to work to create the source recognition. So you see that apple. You know exactly what you're getting. That's a true trademark. So they have what's called the spectrum of distinctiveness, which I just love that. I think it's

Liz Stapleton [00:25:04]:
so funny.

Jamie Lieberman [00:25:05]:
it's so good. And so the arbitrary, the fanciful, those are more protected than generic marks. So generic marks would be if I tried to call a line of computers computer. you can't do that because you you essentially can't stop other people from utilizing names that are commonly known to mean a certain thing.

Liz Stapleton [00:25:25]:
-- very much works on soda. You call it soda. Correct.

Jamie Lieberman [00:25:28]:
Xerox is a great example. Kleenex too. That's called genericizing your name. And so you essentially have created, over Google is a great example of that. They don't want you to say you're googling something unless you're using Google. and Xerox. It's not Xerox. It's copying. and so the words just maintain their strong trademark status. They can't mean what they are. So the issue doesn't really become a generic. It becomes with descriptive. So merely descriptive is one of the common reasons why trademark get rejected by the trademark office. and that just means it describes what it is. a common example is if you've ever driven to an airport and you park your car to park and fly. those are considered, or now they have protection because they've been around a long time and have acquired distinctiveness, but that is descriptive. It is parking and flying. and so if your blog describes what it is that you do, for example, you if you teach SEO and you say SEO teaching SEO is the name of your blog, That's great for SEO, and there's nothing wrong with that, but you may have a harder time getting trademark protection. It's a trade off. And that's because, obviously, the trademark office wants to work and make sure the companies are working to create sources that people will immediately think of. And so it's a it's a business decision to make whether or not you want to make something that's a little bit more fanciful or suggestive Suggestive is really the sweet spot where I see most blogs. so it's not necessarily describing what they do, but it suggests it. So sprint, like, your You know, that suggests a characteristic, like fast data, fast phone, but nobody would ever think that sprint relates to phone services or data services.

Liz Stapleton [00:27:18]:
Yeah. There you go. Yeah. Yes.

Jamie Lieberman [00:27:20]:
So you have to think about it that way too.

Liz Stapleton [00:27:22]:
Yeah. And I know we kinda touched on it, but I don't know that it really drove home is just because someone has the same name as you doesn't mean you can't use it if it's a completely different thing.

Jamie Lieberman [00:27:33]:
Correct.

Liz Stapleton [00:27:33]:
Like, I was just throwing example out there. We as lawyers are very familiar with Lexis. It's a legal research platform. Right? It all samples background checks and laughing. There's also a car company called Lexus. Mhmm. And so the names are the same, but they're completely different industries, and so it's fine. Yep. You know, so just kind of keeping that in mind. I mean, you do walk a fine line if you don't know what you're doing, but --

Jamie Lieberman [00:27:55]:
Yes. Yeah. Exactly. Dove chocolate and dove soap are another example of that.

Liz Stapleton [00:28:00]:
Oh, yeah. That's a great issue.

Jamie Lieberman [00:28:02]:
Yeah. So they they definite. And the interesting thing about Lexus that you've described is they spell it differently.

Liz Stapleton [00:28:09]:
Yes.

Jamie Lieberman [00:28:09]:
Spelling changes though don't matter. So and switching of names. So if you have a mark that's his and hers something and you make it her and his, that's not going to distinguish them properly if there is a likelihood of confusion, misspellings, changing of spellings, you know, changing of one word.

Liz Stapleton [00:28:27]:
What about adding one word? Like the.

Jamie Lieberman [00:28:30]:
No. That that typically will not make a difference. there the trademark office will look. This is where the nuance has come into play. What the dominant words are.

Liz Stapleton [00:28:38]:
Yeah.

Jamie Lieberman [00:28:39]:
Like a the is not a dominant word. and so those dominant words are the ones that need to be distinguished. It doesn't mean words can't overlap, but there has to be enough differences in getting a legal opinion about that is makes all the difference.

Liz Stapleton [00:28:52]:
Oh, absolutely. And like we said, trademark is something you definitely wanna --

Jamie Lieberman [00:28:55]:
Yeah.

Liz Stapleton [00:28:55]:
-- charge an attorney for.

Jamie Lieberman [00:28:57]:
Yes. Absolutely.

Liz Stapleton [00:28:58]:
And that's even me as an I'm an attorney, but I'd still go because this isn't my this isn't my wheelhouse. You know? so I think you know, trade when would you recommend someone getting a trademark? You know, I mean, should they do it first year they're blogging? Should they do, you know, obviously, there's a cost to that.

Jamie Lieberman [00:29:18]:
Sure.

Liz Stapleton [00:29:19]:
but what sort of what do you what's your thoughts?

Jamie Lieberman [00:29:22]:
So if you've been blogging for a really long time and you haven't done trademark registration, you're not allowed to panic. a lot of people do that. I think if you are making money from your business and your brand, if you are building a brand, if you are selling products, and if you want to prevent other people from utilizing a same or similar name, then it is definitely something worth exploring. If you are new and entering the market, just at minimum, have somebody check the name. I had a client who did a whole rebrand. She didn't check the name. And that was a very expensive mistake because she was definitely infringing on somebody else's mark. Who, by the way, when she first checked it, hadn't registered it, but registered it before

Liz Stapleton [00:30:05]:
she. Yeah.

Jamie Lieberman [00:30:06]:
Yeah. So it is important. I don't say that to make people afraid. I say that to help people know that it really happens. and we're not just making it up.

Liz Stapleton [00:30:15]:
Yes. Yes.

Jamie Lieberman [00:30:16]:
It really happens.

Liz Stapleton [00:30:18]:
the domain's available. Doesn't mean?

Jamie Lieberman [00:30:21]:
Oh, thank you. The domain means nothing. The social channels mean nothing. Totally different law. In fact, if you have a registered trademark and somebody else owns the domain, it does not automatically mean you're gonna get you may likely will not. The only thing that you can do is prevent them from putting up content or creating anything or selling anything under that domain that would that would somehow infringe upon your registered mark.

Liz Stapleton [00:30:44]:
Yeah. I mean, it might make them more likely to sell it to you. but --

Jamie Lieberman [00:30:48]:
Maybe you'd be surprised. Yeah. That's the other thing when they drive up the cost.

Liz Stapleton [00:30:52]:
Yeah. They're like, they really want it. They went through for this.

Jamie Lieberman [00:30:55]:
That's exactly right. That's exactly right.

Liz Stapleton [00:30:58]:
but yeah. And then so, obviously, it's gonna vary, but is there, like, a range in cost of how much to, you know, have an attorney do trademark?

Jamie Lieberman [00:31:08]:
It really depends. I think just making sure that you're talking with a good trademark attorney makes all the sense, and just getting an idea from them. I think if you're budgeting somewhere, you know, it's gonna be, I believe it should be a minimum a $1000 for lawyer's time. It's likely much more than that.

Liz Stapleton [00:31:26]:
-- lower? Like, you probably wanna go to a different lawyer.

Jamie Lieberman [00:31:29]:
Yeah. So, I mean, I think probably a few $1000 is something good to budget for that. they're, you know, the fees to the trademark office are

Jamie Lieberman [00:31:36]:
$225

Jamie Lieberman [00:31:38]:
per class that we talked about. So if you have multiple classes of goods and services, you will have multiple filing fees to the trademark office. but, yeah, it's it's not cheap, but it's also, it's worth it.

Liz Stapleton [00:31:50]:
It is. And then that makes it easier to kinda monitor someone -- Yeah. -- files, you know, that's the infringe that you get.

Jamie Lieberman [00:31:57]:
That's another important thing I wanna point out with anything with intellectual property or intellectual property on which, by the way, intellectual property, we're talking about trademarks and copyright. I realize I used that a lot. And we just assume it as a percent of people now.

Liz Stapleton [00:32:10]:
So you're --

Jamie Lieberman [00:32:10]:
Yeah. Good. Intellectual property just means trademarks and copyright. but your intellectual property is only as good as you are willing to prosecute it. So if you are gonna be a creator, And I know nobody everybody's like, the groan. You gotta protect it. You gotta be strong about it. You gotta send those letters You gotta make sure that you stop people from infringing on it. If you don't care, that's okay, but you don't get to have it both ways.

Liz Stapleton [00:32:36]:
So because that's a good point. So you can't if you're gonna file it, you've gotta take steps and continue to protect it. Or you're gonna --

Jamie Lieberman [00:32:43]:
Correct. Yes. Exactly. Or you're or you'll lose it.

Liz Stapleton [00:32:46]:
Yeah. It's a use it or lose it type of thing. like, you know, that lifetime deal you got elsewhere. But, yeah, any final words you care to add or advice or well, not, right, because this is not legal advice. Correct.

Jamie Lieberman [00:33:01]:
We'll get

Liz Stapleton [00:33:01]:
that disclosure at the beginning.

Jamie Lieberman [00:33:03]:
information only. I think

Liz Stapleton [00:33:05]:
-- -- information you would like to have. I don't

Jamie Lieberman [00:33:08]:
know. Exactly. So in my opinion, it's just really smart to talk to a lawyer about your intellectual property, particularly if you're creating products and services, not just your blog, but if you are monetizing your blog and making some money, it is important talk about it. At least understand it so that you can make the decision that's right for you. It's different for everybody. So don't worry what your friends are doing. Don't worry what everyone around you tells you, get to know a lawyer who understands this area, who understands what it's like to be a blogger, how to make money, how you're monetizing, and then really get a good plan in place. Having a good legal strategy, it will make you sleep at night.

Liz Stapleton [00:33:43]:
And that, I think, is an excellent point as well. I mean, they should definitely reach out to hashtag legal is not all lawyers are familiar with this sort of online world of business. there's a lot of And I know because of my previous 9 to 5, like, I was having to, like, I was like, please just learn how to use the computer research. You know? Like, because that was, like, my job was to teach them the platform, but and I was, so there are a lot of kind of crusty lawyers that don't keep up with the technology. Just wanna think of, like, your grandpa. Would your grandpa understand it? You know, if your grandpa's a lawyer, he's not the one you wanna go to if he doesn't understand it. you know, --

Jamie Lieberman [00:34:24]:
Or even your friend who writes Wills.

Liz Stapleton [00:34:26]:
Yes.

Jamie Lieberman [00:34:27]:
Like, your friend could have an awesome Instagram account, and her firm is all about Wills I would never write a will. I don't do real estate closings. There's that reason.

Liz Stapleton [00:34:36]:
So -- I mean, I obviously have a lot of friends that are lawyers. I went to law school, and they don't know doing a lot. No.

Jamie Lieberman [00:34:43]:
Oh, my my husband's an attorney, and I he's a very traditional attorney unlike, myself. And he I go to his stuff and his partners at his law firm are like, what do you do? They don't get it. And I'm like, that's fine. Don't get it.

Liz Stapleton [00:34:54]:
I actually will go to, you know, I'm I'm there's other ones out there, I feel like yours is really well known within this space. It's got great reputation.

Jamie Lieberman [00:35:02]:
Thank you.

Liz Stapleton [00:35:03]:
And you do have a freebie for attendees. It's a negotiation because one of the things you help with too is negotiations and negotiate worksheet. Yes. Anything you wanna share about that?

Jamie Lieberman [00:35:14]:
So negotiation is near and dear to my heart. We do a lot of contract works as well. So hashtag legal does all across the gamut where we do, you know, business information and contracts and privacy, all that good stuff FTC, but contracts and negotiations are sort of near and dear to my heart. I was a law school professor for many years, I taught negotiation. And I really think that as creatives, we sometimes struggle to negotiate

Liz Stapleton [00:35:39]:
Yeah.

Jamie Lieberman [00:35:39]:
Yeah. So I give a lot of talks, about negotiation, and I've created this worksheet that sort of gives you a little bit of a framework on how to negotiate and make it feel more accessible. and I'm actually gonna be putting out a lot more information about negotiation this year. so if you do download the worksheet, you don't have you, but if you do sign up for our mailing list, you're gonna get. We're creating a lot of really cool information products. Not templates. It's not really my jam. I prefer to sort of give people information and things that they can absorb themselves. but, yeah, negotiation is definitely something key that all creatives should think about more

Liz Stapleton [00:36:16]:
Absolutely. because you never know what you ask for. Like, if you could get what you ask for, it's, negotiation, really, it isn't about one party winning or losing. It's about both party things happy.

Jamie Lieberman [00:36:27]:
Yes. Collaborative. I love it.

Liz Stapleton [00:36:30]:
So, definitely, you know, just because a big brand sends you over sponsorship contract doesn't mean you have to sign You know, you --

Jamie Lieberman [00:36:36]:
Thank you. Redline that. Oh my gosh. Never I've never been in this is the 1st industry I was in where contracts did not get redlined regularly. I know. Yeah. You should be. You should for sure be negotiating for yourself. You'd be shocked at what you can get. So I created this. it's totally a free download, but I think it's pretty helpful in at least giving a good framework to make it feel less scary.

Liz Stapleton [00:37:00]:
Yes. Absolutely. Awesome. Well, thank you. That was great. And hopefully everyone goes to download that and has found this helpful. I think it really shines light and and kind of because it it's it's one of the things that people are scared because they don't know, and hopefully they'll be a little more, and they'll be a little more comfortable. So thank you.

Jamie Lieberman [00:37:18]:
Thank you.
